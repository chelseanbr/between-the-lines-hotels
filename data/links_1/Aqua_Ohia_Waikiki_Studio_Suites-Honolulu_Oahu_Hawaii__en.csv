We have booked a noncancellation room, but after reading the review here in tripadviser it stressing me out, so I have contacted Katerine directly and Katherine has been very kind and very lovely to upgraded our room and esnure the room was fully cleaned prior to us staying. So I decide to do my very review of the hotel room 1080:1. Best location in waikiki 1minute walk to International Market Place, opposit Market Lane and eatery as well as Nordstrom Rack, minutes to Ross seaside and 10min walk to public beach waikiki, minute walk to Waikiki Trolley and Bus stop. So eat, shop and repeat in a matter of minute and walking distance. 2. Clean room with no issue of airconditioning or hot water Room was fully cleaned before our stay, there was not any issue like what other traveller here have said, i have never find any ants or insect, as a matter of fact, they do have insects inspection/spray to ensure the room is clear of bugs (thank you) '3. Room with viewRoom we stayed 1080 has the best view facing the street, if you are looking to stay here, please upgrade to street view room or deluxe room.4. Spacious studio suiteWe have been upgraded to Deluxe room 1080 and it was so specious that our kids could run around, would no doubt requested for the same room next visit.5. Entertainment in roomThey have cable TV, so it helps when you dont feel like going out but the kids is not bored as they have all day long Disney chanel to entertain the kids. 6. Super friendly lobby staffLobby staffs are very friendly and fully of Aloha spirit. Loves their greeting every morning especially Moe, he has made my day with his smile and one of the girl, i could not record her name, but always smile when we arrive :)7. AmenitiesThey put out free coffee in the early moring and free iced tea in the afteroon, could I please say they have the best iced tea, I love their ice tea there and the kids really love it too. They have small pool, we spent some times there even though some day could be very cold as it is not heated, but still good enough. Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for budget hotel with best of everything, if you are looking for luxury hotel with luxury room and facility, then can look for the 5 stars hotel like Royal Hawaiin, but if you are looking for good budget and best locaiton ever, this is your to go to hotel. Should you have any issue, you can always get in contact with Katherine, she has made our first family holiday a fabulous one and no doubt the best hotel experince I have ever experience (Katherine always waived our resort fees, i dont know how much thank you I could say to her for going above and beyond ensure we have a great experience). Mahalo to all the team at Aqua Ohia, and expect us again next time when we are in Waikiki :)Cheers Lynda",,lyndatea,1,5.0

The photos of the rooms online must be the very few they have updated. I don't normally like to leave bad reviews as I understand that sometimes things happen, but after reading other bad reviews and the responses from management, it seems they don't actually fix any of the things they say they are going to. Our room was outdated, dirty, and smelled. The shower had mold in it and hair, the floors were so gross we kept our shoes on at all times. One of the beds had holes in the blankets. To top it off, they charge you an amenity fee AND a resort fee (what resort?) that is not included in the price you see online. Oh, and if you try parking in their parking garage (if it isn't already filled up and you have to find parking elsewhere), turning in to the steep driveway will probably scrape up the bottom of your car.",,flyfishingnomads,2,2.0

This is very common and covers most If not all accommodation in this price range. Honolulu has also adopted the Las Vegas style resort fee. This particular hotel has the nerve to call itself “studio suites’ It is in-fact shoddy old decrepit small rooms. In Europe you wouldn’t pay more than €45 a night for such rooms.

Asked front desk and lady at the tours advice to help us find a tour and she pointed to get the brochure. Also asked how do we catch public transport. She said just Google bus times. No help with anything about the place town bus times etc not tours. Didn’t even give us a map about Waikiki etc. Day 3. No hot water and no one told us about it. We got back at midnight and I was about to shower and it was cold. I called front desk and they brushed it off yet again showed no concern or emotion and said. Oh. Yeah. No hot water. Said to shower in another hotel room at 1am. Very poor. Day 4 complained to management Paulette for all able and she said best she can do is Move to another room. This room was just as bad. Warm water. Ugly and old and dirty shower. Toilet gurgling. Very loudly. And shower was leaking water everywhere on the floor like a massive puddle. Dangerous As that is where he toilet was too. It collected water with two towels drenched. Reported this and she couldn’t care less. Then again asked at front desk with help on how to get to the north shore. No help then they Said go see Aston waikkki. Their Other sister hotel many blocks away. Poor service. Bad bad bad service.  Day 5 Made complaint again for all above issues and beat they can do is a 15% off restaurant which was too expensive and already in the local coupon book for everyone. So nothing exclusive. Gave voucher for bus said it was to go to the biggest shopping center. It doesn’t. It actually goes to the ghetto instead. So again another slap in face and rip off. I demanded a refund of amenity/resort fees. Paulette management said best she can do is only two nights of resort fees returned after I check out. Not good enough. And won’t keep their word as their slack and did nothing to fix all the above room issues. Every night unable to sleep with sound from shower dripping water and all Over the floor and the Toilet gushing noises and Noises from freezer all night. Couldn’t sleep Then by day 8 still no hot waterNo hot water. With a new surprise we now have Bugs crawling in the hotel, the shower, bathroom, toilet and table in our bedroomGuy came in with fly spray. That’s it!Dirty disgusting showerFront door doesn’t close. Asked 4 times to fix it. And still didn’t. The Elevator takes over a 15 minute wait for it to arrive every time. Then for 4 days straight no air conditioning. After 4 days they gave us a fan. And we were to go home the next day. When I asked why it wasn’t fixed. Lana the supervisor showed no care in the world and said. They will do what they can do. That is a fan. Pathetic. They gave us tickets for 2 days to catch a bus and it doesn’t work in our area so that is ridiculous. Waited 90 min for a bus and still no bus. So walked 40 min to our destination in the heat. Spoke with a Michael to discuss air con. And he didn’t care either. Told him door won’t close and ants and bugs. And cold water still. Didn’t do anything. I asked Lana for resort fees refund and she yelled and said no way. Speak to manager. I said I can’t as I’m leaving and she said bad luck. I finally got 12 nights of resort fees $28 usd. But still paid $2100 aud for hotel that provided nothing but issues and disgust. Out hotel did nothing to help or make us feel wanted helped. Nothing. No information on what to do. A map nothing.

The location is good, lots of places to eat nearby and very close to a number of shopping places. The hotel itself is pretty dated. As far as Waikiki goes, it's one of the less expensive hotels. The room was spacious, although very dated and the bathroom was tiny.Hotel staff were a mixed lot - some very helpful and others seemed irritated at having to provide service.The resort fee is a definite hidden cost if you are booking through Agoda or a similar booking agent. We believed we had paid in full for accommodation only to be slugged with a US$250 resort bill for our 9 night stay that was payable on check-in. When we questioned what this was for we were informed it was for the use of beach towels and wifi. The wifi was dodgy at best and the beach towels were threadbare so we were unimpressed with this. I now know that a resort fee of anywhere between US$20 - US$40 per day is payable at all hotels in Waikiki so be aware of this if you are not booking directly with the hotel.The pool at the hotel is very small for the number of guests and has no real ambience.

I am a very green traveler and it just irked me that because I am vegan, I was not able to really experience the green incentive the hotel was trying to provide. There was not even one Vegan option in the resto.2) My problem the whole time was the aircon. Hawaii was very hot for me during my trip there, and when the electrician came in, he apologized because he said it's not a localized thing, the whole centralized thing is faulty. He said that they have been getting a lot of complaints and it turns out there is no improvement nor even cleaning made on the AC system, still!. I think I believe him! I took pictures of the vents of my room's AC and it was super filthy. It's a risk esp. to those with respiratory problems and I have bronchial asthma. The electrician was courteous enough and he offered me an electric fan. He said he will advise the front desk but alas, no one called me. I did not make an effort anymore because first, it was centralized; so no matter what room I switch into it's futile. Also, I already settled in and having a bad case of jetlag/cabin fever I did not want to go to the motions already. The 3 days, 2 nights I was there I felt like being broiled slowly into my death.3) The exhaust in the bathroom, I do not know if it's working, but like the water sprinkler in the room, it's rotting. There was a lime green scale thing growing out of the fixtures. I took a picture of them too for my reviews. I feel they just renovated the lobby and pool but with the other essentials in the rooms, they have forgotten about it. Perhaps it was just a facade. On some good points I commended on their survey 3 awesome staff members. Also laud their 7 layer filtration system fountain since I get to refill my tumbler all the time.

Can not fault the friendliness and helpfulness of all the staff we encountered. Checking in late at night was easy and quick.

Which is huge and great to go for a day. The bus was air conditioned and the driver super friendly. Our room was tight, for two single people. But still ok for us. The beds were super comfy. My friend didn’t like the sheets saying hers kept coming untucked and scrunching up. I didn’t have that issue. Twice the room wasn’t made up, though I thought sheets were clean enough anyway. We had the kitchenette and in hindsight didn’t really need it. Thought we’d make coffee etc. there’s National hire car directly across the road if you’re looking to drive around the island. If you want a mustang, book a couple of days in advance and book it from open time so you get one. Otherwise you may get other type of convertible. Now, although the tiki bar in the hotel complex is apparently not part of the hotel, it’s still there and I have to mention this. Having sat in there having drinks for majority of the afternoon, hosts were very friendly, however we believe something was amiss with our bill. We didn’t get an itemised bill as one of our party out it on their card. But the Aussie dollar conversion for the bill was $684 dollars.Now - we might be able to drink a bit, but we would not have drank that many drinks for the bill to be that high.

While the location is good, I found the property to be a bit lacking.The lobby is well maintained and appears modern and the staff were always friendly and welcoming. There is a beach towel service that was very handy and a water bottle refilling machine in the lobby. The pool is very small and there are pool washrooms for hotel guests (using a key card to access).The room was clean and just roomy enough though it is a little dated. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bathroom, however, needs significant updating. The shower head was quite weak, and the toilet was located in an awkward spot facing the counter, with very little space to maneuver.Secure parking is available for a fee each night HOWEVER vehicles were double parked almost every single day we were there; we had to drop off the rental car keys to the front desk every time we parked so that they could rearrange the cars as needed. This was less than ideal as the parking garage is already very small and hard to drive through without vehicles being double parked.The location of the hotel was fantastic if you plan to be at the beach or out and about most days, and do NOT need parking. There's a number of restaurants, shops and bars nearby, some located right downstairs and across the street.Overall, we had a decent stay aside from the parking garage hassle but I'm inclined to spend a bit more and stay somewhere nicer on my next trip to Oahu.

The AC was a major letdown (didn't work at all), and there were some minor maintenance issues in our room (squeaky doors, wear & tear, stains, etc.). Also, there were no blackout curtains, and the walls were super thin, so it was pretty noisy. However, we didn't spend a lot of time in the room other than to sleep, so it was ok for what we needed. I liked that it was so central to all the shopping/restaurants, and that it was a short walk to the beach. Don't go expecting something super swanky, because that's not this hotel.

The bright, fresh looking rooms on their website is not what you will see when you get there. We had two water leaks, one in floor and one in ceiling, standing water in another location of ceiling from a leak somewhere, housekeeping did not service the room for first five days because she was afraid of our dog even though we secured him in his kennel, our mattresses were stained with pee and blood and had to be replaced, carpet had pee and spill stains, the sliding glass door to balcony would often come off track or stick (my husband was stuck on balcony one night for about 20 minutes), lack of hot water, bugs, the smoke detector was detached and inoperable, and there were smears of god knows what all over the walls. The laundry room reeked of must and mold. All of the washing machines were very rusty and 6 out of the 10 dryers were broken.

I've been at the Ohia for about 3 months now and can honestly say that it has been the most fun and at home that I have ever felt while traveling, from the complimentary drinks and food on mondays to the extremely courteous staff greeting you every time you arrive. My room was awesome! It had a small kitchenette that was perfect for cooking up meals to save some money, an extremely comfortable bed, and the view from my room was amazing! I had zero issues with my room and when I requested something the staff was always quick to help. The Ohia is great because of its location in Waikiki, it's walking distance to everything but it's slightly set back from the majority of tourists so it's the best of both worlds!

I believe 3 is what this hotel is worth at the most and struggle to rate this low without a serious complaint. BUT I dont want to raise any expectations of people that this is a modern hotel. The bathrooms are weary and hence dont feel that clean. The carpets are thread bare, there were no glasses for drinking juice or cool drinks in the kitchen or knives for cutting fruit like pineapple. There was an oven but I dont know what for as there really werent facilities to cook like enough utensils. The fridge barely kept things cold and certainly didnt freeze the ice cream we bought. So damn it we had to eat it all at once :) .The doors were hard to open and in general this needed a fair bit of maintenance.The staff were pleasant and check in was easy. Great to have swappable towels for the beach. Would have been nice to have had a wee kick back like at other places when you dont take up room service each day.It had a pool which was cool and refreshing with lights the kids loved at night.Fresh cool tea and water at the lobby was nice. A great large waiting area and loved the 12 noon check out. We didnt need it but I can see how it would allow you to go out for a swim and breakfast before you left.There was baggage storage facilities if you were early. I was glad about a free shuttle to Alamoana shopping center....... but we caught this one day and it did turn up but on the other 2 days we waited over an hour to have nothing turn up and we had to catch the pink line one day and a friendly shuttle driver from another hotel took us the other.This Hotel was in a great spot for both getting to the beach in 5 minutes walk and getting to dinner and eating at a wonderful selection of pplaces just across the road.","Christchurch, New Zealand","superhostchch</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",0,3.0

Beware when booking a ""suite"" room, there are no real suites, they just stick an extra bed or two into an already tiny room. Bed options are nog guaranteed which can be a problem for some. We booked a kind and two singles and got 3 singles. One person had to sleep on the floor. Nonsense. Hotel staff are not very polished, check-in system is slow and inadequate. Parking garage also problematic. This is an old hotel that has seen better days, it needs to a major renovation to bring it up to current standards in Waikiki.

Our room was amazing and more than enough space for just the 2 of us. As for the entire hotel -- it is older, but pretty much all the hotels on the Waikiki strip are. The 2 elevators are small in space, but both worked well (even with a little jolt here and there), and we took delight in the air freshener dispenser being used. The swimming pool is not very big and we didn't use it, but there was always someone in it every time we passed by it, and it looked rather clean and well-maintained. The parking can be a little arduous, especially if you're trying to park in the lower level. SLOW & STEADY for turning in and getting out of the lower level gate! And if you're in a SUV -- even more luck to you that your vehicle doesn't reach the overhead pipes in the lower garage (I actually saw a SUV that had 1 corner touching a pipe). If anything -- you'll learn how to maneuver and park like a champ in their parking area! We found the staff we interacted with to be very helpful and going above and beyond (Robert at the front desk and Maricel with housekeeping!!). We found the location to be perfect despite boarded-up vuildings next door that can appear frightening on your first day. Aqua Ohia is a block from Waikiki Beach, basically across the street from the International Market, and there are all types of restaurants and shops around you.

I’m no expert, but if you look on the internet, they really look like bedbugs. The decision was quickly taken, not to stay in the hotel.I brought one of the bugs to the reception at midnight, the receptionist had a reaction of disgust, said she would report to the manager and gave us another room. Of course, as the doubt was in our head, we had a very bad night, with lights on to make the eventual bugs stay hidden, looking in every corner to be sure that our luggage would not be infected…On the next day, the manager met us, but didn’t really believe us. He told he didn’t hear from the bug we brought during the night. “I wasn’t there, so I cannot say”. The housekeeping controlled the room, didn’t find anything. A specialized company was called afterwards, and didn’t find anything as well. Well, I wonder how they didn’t, while we found two. Anyway…We left after the first night, the second night was reimbursed. But the only compensation we had for the horrible first night was the refund of the service fees (26$, youhouhou!), we still had to pay the night. Though, we had to get all of our luggage, clothes, etc., cleaned when we came back in our country, as we all know that bedbugs are the worst nightmare of your life once they colonize your place.Once again, I have no proofs that these are bedbugs, bud the appearances are what they are and once the doubt is in one’s head… it’s hard not to be careful.I will never come back, and don’t advice you to go.",,Adrien D,3,2.0

There was free tea in the lobby and access to the restaurant next door. Instead of a big glass sliding door like the other hotels, this one has a normal glass door that you pull open. The check-in desk area was nice and uncluttered but since it's a small space, can be congested during check-in/check out times. Service 5: The front desk personnel were friendly and served up ""aloha"" with every interaction. We had some issues that weren't their fault, but they helped us in and were very friendly. The bell-man and housekeeping were exceptionally good (Glenn and Connie). They were always smiling and friendly and were always there to help us with whatever we needed. They are truly exceptional and deserve recognition. Room 3: Here’s where you are reminded that you paid less than the other hotels. The room was old and felt like it. The walls were this off-white/yellow color and the fixtures were definitely dated. However, the upside is that you paid less (hopefully) and you’re in an excellent location with OK views. You’re in Hawaii and should be outdoors anyway, so making small sacrifices for a less than stellar room are ok and expected. It wasn’t dingy by any means, but it wasn’t the magazine picture some imagine when they visit Waikiki. But don’t get me wrong, it was more than acceptable for the area. Overall 4: We had a great stay and while I wish there were more amenities (Bigger pool, gym, hot tub…) the hotel did have everything you’d normally expect. The parking was pricey but if you didn’t bring or rent a car, you’re ok. The absolute best parts were: Location and Service! Sure it’s not as nice as some of the pricier options, but this is a great value for those wanting to stay in the heart of Waikiki without breaking the bank AS much.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Muirob</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",0,4.0

For our 10 night stay, it was fine. The front office staff were lovely and always said hello to our kids every time we walked through reception. It is the issues that have occured after we have left that have really left a bad taste in our mouths, and has changed our whole opinion of this hotel.Let me start with the few positives of this hotel. Good location, friendly reception staff, the water/iced tea/coffee a nice touch in the lobby. Usually always a doorman to help open the door if we had hands full. No issues asking for more towels, WiFi good. They allowed us to check in early as we arrived at the hotel by 7am, I think initially they weren't going to, but we were travelling with our two young children and our 4 year old had fallen asleep in their lobby once we arrived, and we were told when asking if there was somewhere we could change our baby they let us know they would put us in another room (why this wasn't offered initially to us if it was clean and available, I don't know).Now, the negatives. Room was too small for two adults, a 4 year old and a baby in a portacot. I am well aware of the type of room we booked, but I think we should have been advised when booking that the room is quite small, especially once a portacot is set up at the end of one of the double beds, so then we had an opportunity to either book a larger room, or look elsewhere.You pay a service fee daily but the room is not serviced daily. We were 4 people in a small room and the room was not serviced daily (maybe every 2-3 days if we were lucky, and staying 10 nights with kids, we would have thought it would be done daily). When it was, it was fine, and we thought housekeeping was lovely (AT THE TIME OF STAY).We checked out of our room around 4am for an early flight back to Australia. My husband left an expensive item behind in our room. He mentioned it to me in the taxi to the airport, but as we were only relying on WiFi on our phones, we could not contact the hotel until we were back home. I fully expected that we would have had some sort of contact from the hotel when we got home to let us know we left this item behind. Anyway, we unpacked all of our suitcases the day after we arrived home to be sure the item was not mistakenly packed away. It was not. I have been in contact with this hotel for over a month now, who say this item was 'not found' by housekeeping when they went in to our room. We were told security cameras would be checked, and the general manager would be notified. To this day, I have not heard anything in regards to if anything was seen on the cameras, and I continue to ask for contact details of the general manager which these requests keep being ignored. The way this has been handled is horrible and does not fend well for the hotel itself.In short, this expensive item has virtually disappeared from our room, from when we checked out to when housekeeping entered the room. I am annoyed as we paid a service fee each day to housekeeping that not only took the generous tip left behind by us in our room, we are also lead to believe that this expensive item was taken too, as there is no other logical explanation. I feel sick to my stomach that over a MONTH later, there is still no resolution. There is also a terrible lack of communication, I have sent through all requested paperwork to them and there hasn't even been an email of acknowledgement to advise it has been received and things are in process. And when I say 'things are in process', I don't even know what the hotel is doing with all the information I have provided them (photos of the item, a step by step account of our morning before we checked out, hand written accounts, where exactly the item was left in the room etc), I personally believe some sort of compensation to us should be provided, for the item and for a level of the service fee because why have we paid for a service fee when an item has mysteriously disappeared from our room after we checked out???I would not recommend anyone I know to stay at this hotel due to the reasons listed above. I find it horrible that a hotel thinks this sort of behaviour is okay, and to drag a process on for over a month with no resolution is actually disgusting for the customer. And if the hotel do read their reviews, I would very much appreciate some contact from the general manager (asking for the fifth time now), as the way this is being handled is disgraceful.","Melbourne, Australia","pants87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",25,1.0

That didn’t work so he said he would be back and vacuum up the water and snake it. He said he couldn’t snake it until 9am because people might complain! 20 mins later he still didn’t show up to vacuum it! We left came back and noticed he used the towels and didn’t have anyone bring more! The WiFi wouldn’t work very well! I did the environment friendly program! They said the credit was good for the restaurant! Never once said couldn’t use it at the bar! They also told us they would empty our trash every day no one came until I brought it up 5 days later! The room was in very bad shape! I took pictures of it! There was mold in the shower mold and in sliding door track! Some thing was drooping from the wall! None of the lights were plugged in except the one on the desk! The oulet plugs couldn’t keep my charger plugged in it kept falling down! Their was a electrical cord capped off but hanging in the sliding door area! The restaurant/bar smelled gross!

Our first room was smelly, the air conditioning didn’t work after making three complaints about this we were given three fans to ventilate the room. The beds are small and does not accommodate more than four adult travellers like the description which says “6”. We asked for a rollaway bed on day one and have continued to follow it up cause the communication of staff is the worst I’ve seen. On our final day we were told a rollaway would be $35 extra a day We resulted in moving the beds together to find a vomit stain on carpet.Our shower was clogged and filled the bathtub as we showered to our knees. A panel in the shower roof started leaking in our first room. It then started to seep into the carpets outside the toilet. After making two phone calls and going down to reception to seek answers we were told “pack your bags you will be moving”. There was no assistance from any staff to help move our luggage to the lobby, then to our new room. There was faeces stains on bathroom wall. The lamp and chair are broken. The power point in room don’t work. The toilet door handle was broken and didn’t lock. We asked for extra pillows on day got them on our final night The shuttle bus took an hour to get to Ala Moana we decided two dollars spent on the Pink Line Bus was better and safer than using the Shuttle again Staff took an hour and a half to address our concerns about room number one moving us at 11pm on a Saturday night with no assistance. No notes were made in computer. When we asked about previous requests or problems no one knew anything about previous complaints. We were paying a service fee and our room didn’t even get cleaned on day four, we saw housekeeping as we left and let her know we left. We were told cause we had the do not disturb sign on our door, however on the previous three days housekeeping has ignored this sign and come into the room at 7-8am. It took 15 mins to get a fresh towel after once again making a complaint. Housekeeping left our room open for over an hour whilst we were out  With a travel party of four who work for an airline we know a thing or two about customer service and hotels so I can 100% guarantee I will not be recommending this hotel to any future passengers or fellow crew who are travelling to Hawaii!!

We have tested many hotels - some hits and some serious miss. This time, we decided to go back to a trusted brand but one of their many hotels along Waikiki. Aqua Ohia is nicely situated in the midst of the action. It may not be on the main stretch of Waikiki, but Kuhio Avenue is the on the back end where it’s not as busy as well. So we give location a huge tick.Service by the staff were wonderful. They truly bring you the aloha that you expect - extremely helpful and friendly. Even the security guys are hands on in helping the guests. Yet another tick.As for the rooms - on the positive side, the room is extremely clean, tidy and adequately furnished. The bed mattresses are comfortable and there’s enough storage space if guests needs it. There is a safe, bar fridge (not loaded though) and surprisingly, even a stove with pots and pans. However, like much of Hawaii, the building structure and interiors like walls, hallways, and lifts are deeply in need of upgrades. We can tell evidently that the hotel have attempted to give the place a fresh coat of pain, and the carpets may perhaps even be changed recently. However, the corridors are dark, musky and almost a bit too depressing. The bathrooms and it’s vanities and shower are also very dated and holding up just enough to do the job. Overall, like most visitors to Hawaii, if you are looking at spending most of your time out of your room and only returning to rest your nights, this hotel is not too bad. It will do the job with not much frills other than comfort, cleanliness and the staff’s friendliness. Aloha and enjoy your trip.

Booked the least expensive room, but did request a king bed. We were 'upgraded' to a corner studio room on the 11th floor with a king bed and a kitchenette at no extra charge. It was quite large. older building with even older carpet it seems - that was ok because we expected it. Pros: friendly staff, free shuttle, free newspaper, morning coffee, water and ice tea in the lobby. Free movie rentals, beach towels and beach chairs (have to ask for the chairs). Great location - short walk to everything. Bus at front door almost. (I was told that there is a kitchenette in all rooms - so do not pay extra for this). Nice city views except when you look down - old buildings and some garbage. Cons: roaches in kitchen. No knives. corners of floor and bathroom on the whole are not cleaned properly. Lots of traffic noise if you have the balcony door open. If you have noisy neighbours on the adjoining balcony, you will not like it. Luckily, this only happened to us 1 night. Tips for saving money: Use that kitchen for breakfasts and meals as much as possible!! Shop at Safeway,(a 15 minute bus ride), not at Food Pantry that is close by. We actually took the bus to Costco and bought rotisserie chicken ($5), frozen veggies, eggs, fruit etc. Go to Walmart. Take a few small grocery items with you (tea bags, coffee,salt, spices, etc so you don't have to buy everything). Ask directions to the local farmers markets. Read the ""free"" events in the elevator each week. Use the Bus ($5.50 for a day pass) - we traveled the entire island this way, the drivers are great.

To be honest, its an older hotel compared to Hilton etc and knowing that, I wasn't expecting 5star hotel. All we wanted, were beds with clean sheets, bathroom with clean towels, stove that worked and we got that. We were well looked after. Anything we needed, the staff accommodated. To those who gave negative reviews, just stay at another hotel. You can't expect to pay cheap rates and get 5star accommodation. I think we got our moneys worth and were satisfied. Also, the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I think the shuttle service, the bus stop just outside the hotel were very convenient if you wanted to go outside Waikiki and everything inside Waikiki, was in walking distance.

She hadn't stayed here and knew nothing about the accommodation but said it was in a good spot. She was right about that! It was in the perfect central location, only a 5 minute walk to Waikiki beach and HEAPS of restaurants, bars and supermarkets. The room was super average - clean but old and worn, outdated decor but good enough just for sleeping! We weren't in the room much except for night time. The day staff behind the front desk weren't great - but this was probably due to them always being busy, which is understandable. I have worked front office in a hotel before and understand it gets frustrating having so many people in front of you at one time but they really let it show that they weren't happy. There was one day were I tripped out the front of the hotel and split my leg open quite badly, my travel buddy went and asked the front desk for alcohol wipes and bandages and was told they didn't have a first aid kit (I actually thought they HAD to under law) but nevertheless my friend had to run to the closest supermarket to get the supplies. The afternoon/night staff were AWESOME. I wish I got the names of 2 who were particularly helpful, a girl and guy who worked together a lot, they were always asking how our trip was, giving us recommendations and always had a smile on their faces and said hello every time we came down the lift.

This hotel is about a 2-2.5*. Here are some pros and cons we found:Let's start with the positive:--staff were amazing. Always polite and helpful with anything we asked, from front desk to housekeeping. --location is decent for walking around Waikiki including a short walk to the beach. --shuttle around Waikiki is free and mostly convenient although there are times you may wait longer than it takes to walk. --pool seems to be kept clean although it's cold and fairly small --ice cold water with lemon and cold tea in the lobby. --free DVDs to rent for your rooms Cons:-- fairly dated. Rooms (we had several in our group and all were in the same state) all need updating badly! Paint, carpet, furniture, fixtures, bathrooms. Our bathroom didn't have a door but instead had a pocket/accordion type thing that did not close properly. --Noisy!! We had rooms on both sides of the hotel and both sides could hear traffic, people yelling, noise/music from the bar, and a rooster!--No blackout curtains (not a big deal if you don't sleep in)--King bed is really as midge bigger than a queen. --Resort fee daily for beach chairs and pool towels. At times there were no pool towels and were given white shower towels and even hand towels!!--stained carpets in rooms. So, wouldn't stay here again but if you are aware of the pros and cons then you can make your choices with full knowledge. I'd simply try another area next time.

The large sliding glass doors made up one whole wall which allowed all manner of noise in (including several police chases, and even a take-down right outside of our window!!!). Privacy was not an option if you have loud speaking neighbors. There is a view of the beach, but only around several buildings. Shopping options are numerous, if you enjoy spending the money. You have to dig for good food places around the area. Of which we found two. Traffic around the hotel is horrible, so it's much faster to walk or take public transportation for $5 all day from midnight to 3:30am the next day.

A reservation was made on 11/21/2017 (3 weeks prior to the reservation date), but the agreed upon reservation was not delivered. Upon arriving to Honolulu we visited the property to verify our reservation with the receptionist who confirmed the 2-day stay for two & assured that everything was good to go. Further, on the day of check-in, we called the hotel at 1:00pm to see if we could check-in early, but we were told to call back at 2:00pm. Where the problem lies is that we booked a Studio/Kitchen (400+ sq ft Rm & 2 Dbl beds), but were given a Small Room (Room 790: 200+ sq ft room with one King Size Bed, & partial kitchen—e.g., fridge & Stove). After spending 1 minute in the room we decided to go back downstairs to the receptionist & point out the difference. The hotel's response was to not charge the $18/day resort fee so long we accepted a Standard Room (Room 1492: 2 Dbl Beds & partial kitchen, e.g., Stove/Fridge). Given that the initial charge was for the Studio Room, I expected them to at least refund the price difference of the rooms or waive the $25/day Parking Fee for not being able to give us the room that was confirmed three weeks prior.I called Hotels.com to explore options & was given the ""Run Around"" with 2 of 3 calls dropping in the process, which further complicated the issue leading to no resolution.Below are photos taken of the reservation room provided versus the expected room.",,471nikiw,1,2.0

The location is really fabulous: near the International Marketplace, shopping, restaurants, bars, cafes for coffee, the Ala Wai Canal, and just a block from Waikiki. I walked to the Convention Center in 20 minutes. A walk to the Zoo takes about 30 minutes. My room was clean and the WiFi worked well there. But in my daughter's room across the hall the WiFi did not work. There seems to be kitchenettes in almost every room. The water pressure and temperature in the shower was great. The reason I feel that staff needs safety training is because of the following, and yes, I have informed the hotel management about how I feel about this incident:The fire alarm for the entire building went off at about 4:30 PM on the 2nd day of my stay. It was a false alarm set off accidentally by a maintenance staff person, but guests did not find this out until about 20 minutes later. I understand things happen and I am an able bodied person who was able to run down 11 flights of stairs to calmly evacuate the building. But I encountered another guest who was so frightened by the experience that she was basically in shock. She was staying on the top floor (19th). What was so very wrong with this situation is the total lack of any information being given to guests as they emerged from the outer stairwell as to the false status of the alarm. I had to walk over to and ask a staff member who was just standing holding a clipboard (which is how I surmised she was a staff member) about 15 feet from the exit and chatting nonchalantly with another employee. She really should have been standing right by the exit at the ready as guests emerged to reassure them that there was no real emergency and to APOLOGIZE for the inconvenience and possible anxiety this mistake had caused. I put ""apologize"" in all caps because not one member of staff ever said they were sorry on behalf of the hotel. Not that employee nor any of the ones in the lobby as guests were coming back into the hotel. It felt as if no one was in charge at the hotel. By the way, no staff member came outside to tell the guests we could go back in. We had to figure that out on our own. In conclusion, it seems that staff have had little to no training in what their roles should be in an actual emergency, and that is a very scary prospect.

Next time, I think I'll just pay more money up front. Organization:This hotel is all over the place. Their website is pretty confusing because there are so many different room rates to choose from. I ended up calling to book. I was told that 1 night deposit would be taken from my card immediately and I would be sent a confirmation email. I never got the email. I called back a few days after booking and someone ended up sending it to me manually. I then noticed a few weeks later that the deposit was never taken from my card. On the email they sent me it says amenity fees are an additional $18/day but on the website in one place it says $25/day and in another place it says $26/day ... again, this hotel is very confusing. The employees also seem to be a little confused. I decided I wanted to check out a day early and the first employee I spoke with told me she ""didn't know"" the refund procedures. When I finally did check out, I was told I'd get $50 back on my card from the security hold. After a week of not seeing the $50 I called the hotel and the first employee told me my card was over charged by about $40 then the 2nd employee I spoke with said my card was charged the correct amount and I would not be seeing a $50 refund because the hold for incidentals was never taken. Now, its about 2 weeks since I checked out and I still have no clue exactly how much my room cost. Renovations: The pictures posted on their website and the modern feel of the lobby are very deceiving. Everything in the room from the carpet to the toilets needs to be replaced. The rooms are very small. The shower is even smaller and needs to be resurfaced. There's a stove in the room but it seems pretty unnecessary given the size of the room. The pool is also pretty small, but the beach is very close. The balcony was nice but the table out there was full of dirt, grime, and cigarette ashes. Our balcony also overlooked an alley that appeared to be the hangout spot for local bar employees when they got off work. Every night starting at around 3am about 5-10 people would gather in the alley playing music and speaking very loud. It woke us up every night. Despite the negatives there are some nice things about this hotel. Pros:Great location! We walked to the beach and shopping areas. The local bus comes right out front and we were able to take that into downtown Honolulu. Nice staff. When I checked in, the bank put a hold on my card since such a large transaction in Hawaii was out of the norm for me. The employee allowed me to pay cash for my first night until I worked things out with my bank the next morning. If you're a college student or a minimalist, this hotel might work for you. But if you are looking for a nice relaxing vacation but inside and out of the hotel I wouldn't recommend Aqua Ohia. #DoItWhileYouCan ","CLEVELAND, United States","Ashlee-Denise</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>CLEVELAND, United States</strong>",150,2.0

Must of taken the pictures when it was newly renovated. My partner and I who was suppose to be on a romantic getaway fought the whole time as he hated it so much he couldn't let go on the condition of the hotel. Immediately after we got there we had to fight for not paying parking as it was included in our reservation. We then had to search emails and email the manager our proof. We arrived on our floor and as we entered the hallway to the room, the toxic bleach smell coming from the room was overwhelming. Thinking they may have only just cleaned the room we entered to a grotty room with a bed on an angel because the casters were missing off the front of the bed. Mind you we were in the top paying room. The shower, you could barely lift your arms up without touching the sides, power switches and light fixtures included lamps were all old and falling apart with no actual light in the ceiling to turn on. All décor was extremely out-dated and falling apart. After procrastinating for half an hour or so we decided to call management as the bleach smell was still so bad it was burning my sinus's and making us feel ill. We even offered to even pay more to upgrade and there was no upgrade and was told we will be put in another room. Hours later, we were put in another room with no smell but the condition of the room was still the same and the air conditioner barely worked. You could barely cannot on the internet as well. So poor. For $200 a night this was extremely unacceptable. As this was a non-refundable room there was nothing we could do about it unless we persisted and continued to ruin our time in Waikiki, we wasted more than half a day sorting the room out. We were on the 15th floor and thought we would at least get some quiet sleep, however there was a nightclub located next door that played extremely loud music most nights and it felt like we were on the first floor. When we checked out they then argued the parking again and try to charge us at 4am in the morning on the way to the airport. They did charge us but days later refunded it. When I asked to speak the manager - The manager had resigned...No wonder as so many other complaints were going in when we where in the lobby as well. The pool is basically the size of 2 spas so don't expect to do any laps. The staff however were polite. I've stayed in many hotels and I am definitely not a person to complain but I booked this through flight centre agent who also did nothing about it and thought if I booked it through a travel agent it must be decent. The hotel did not offer any type of compensation nor a personal apology.

I was lucky to find street parking on 5 nights for the total meter cost of 10.00 dollars as opposed to the 125.00 I would have spent if I parked in their lot. Also they have no business center with a computer so if you don't have a portable device you have no access to the internet.

One star because I can't make it zero stars. The only upside is the proximity to a lot of restaurants, souvenir shopping and Honolulu Cookie Company. So let's start from the beginning.. I booked this hotel through booking.com beginning of September for 2 double beds and was quoted $388.32 for 2 nights INCLUDING taxes and resort fee. No mention of parking fee. Okay sure, we're in the middle of the city, $25 a night is worth not having to deal with break-ins or finding parking. One of my travel partners is actively coughing so we decide to ADD a room. It can't be that hard right? As long as you have availability? So I call them at 8am this morning to try to arrange it if possible, otherwise we'll keep our reservation. They say they have rooms but the girl I spoke to had no idea what kind of room we have. So she suggests to get there early and try to work it out in person. Fine, I can do that, that's reasonable since it's last minute. Fast forward to 1:30pm, an hour an a half before check-in time. I show up with my group of 3, and try to book an additional room. Omar is helping us. He says we can get an equivalent room with one king bed, and it's just a lot bigger. And we add another standard room for my travel partner. He says it's $288.94 for the additional room for 2 nights. So I put it on my card. We get a receipt, and he says to come back at 3pm. By the way, we signed the agreement, put down our card information, etc. So when we return we should be able to just pick up the key cards and go to our room. 3pm rolls around. The lobby is packed because a bus of tourists are dropped off. We stand in line to wait for the 3 receptionists to get everyone checked in. 20 minutes later, we get to the desk and Honey is taking care of us. Oh surprise! You only made half of the first payment. And the new standard room now has a resort fee and taxes on top of the $288 we JUST paid. So I have no idea what the final total should be. We're 45 minutes now on the 2nd round of checking in, so I'm so frustrated, I just want it to be over. Honey finally gets our room keys ready, I gather all the receipts and promise her I will make sure they are right later after the payments have settled. Not ONE of the charges on any of the receipts is the same. See attached picture. So I will blame their terrible system here, it's not really on the receptionist. BUT the one thing a receptionist should get right? Making sure the room they just assigned you is cleaned and unoccupied. Nope. I use my key on room 280, and run into a poor man in his underwear. Who freaks out and closes the door on me. No words. No goddamn words. If I was a cartoon, you can see the flames from my head. My husband and I go back to the lobby and ask for the manager. We get the supervisor instead who puts us in room 1190. He takes off the $20 resort fee for all the rooms (4), and somehow it comes to $75?? Whatever. After we return from an excursion, we find they have left macadamia candy, cookies and water in our room. A free night might have been better. Additional reasons not to stay here: hotel past the lobby is dated, smells of bleach and chemicals, shower is dirty and looks like a 5 year old did the caulking. And it's over $200 a night.

It was well within our budget with some high quality services. All of the front desk staff were wonderful from check in to check out. Kris was especially friendly! She set us up with a pre-check in procedure and let us know about all of the hotel's features including free wifi in all the rooms (included in resort fee) and the best feature- an unlimited DVD rental kiosk in the lobby to use for the PS3 in each room. So cool! We were able to store our bags with the bell hop so we could go explore Waikiki until the 3pm check in time. We ended up getting a very private room on the 14th floor that was through the emergency exit door. We thought it was a bit odd given that we were so secluded but it was so quiet and private. The only downside is that all of the housekeeping trash was kept outside our room door on the balcony. Other than that- we loved our room. A bit small with a tiny bathroom but it came stocked with dish-ware and a tiny stove for cooking. They even provide beach towels for you to use during your stay.

The room was lovely, though there was a few more beds than requested, that didn't bother me as the space was very nice and the area was very clean! The room is cleaned daily in the morning by wonderful housekeeping staff and provides fresh linen, soaps, coffee. Having a kitchenette allowed me to cook my meals and avoid paying high prices at restaurants the closest supermarket is Food Pantry however other great places to shop for food.

My experience here has been outstanding their service and attention to detail to making your stay as comfortable as possible. While this isn't a luxury class hotel, it is great for a small family, couple or solo travelers, the rooms need a bit of a refurbishment eventually but is simple, safe, secure and accessible to nearby beaches, parks and tour pickup locations.

The kitchenette has cutlery and utensils and an old stove but no microwave. 3 of the exact same cheap prints on walls looked tacky. Lots of loud music coming from a nearby bar/venue all night long made sleep disturbed. If you want to listen to a DJ on the mic in the early hours of the morning this is the place to stay.

The resort amenities fee of $18 per day is a rip off and should include at least a basic breakfast. This is definitely no resort. The pool area is absolutely tiny and gets shade in the afternoon so you would be better off using the beach. There is good wifi in the rooms.

This hotel is amazing. The staff I dealt with upon check in was amazing. Even during my early morning checkout it was amazing. I stayed on the 12th floor in the studio apartment room. Pineapple room.to be exact. The room had all the furnishings you would need for an extended stay. Fridge and stove. Plates. Bowls. Pan and pot. Silverware as well. The soaps and shampoo/conditioner that were provided were Hawaiian tropics and smelled great. The room was spot on clean. Bed was made with fresh linen all around. The bed had a long pillow that said ""ALOHA"" on it. Was a nice touch. The only problem I saw in the whole room was that they shower curtain had mold at the bottom. But to me that wasn't a big deal. Everything else was clean and smelled great. Plus the price of the room was a bonus and was worth every penny. The hotel is two blocks from public beach access. There are plenty of restaurants within a five minute walk. You can literally walk right across the street and there is a ton of great food right there. There is a gentlemen's club or two a few doors down from the hotel. But if you don't go out late at night you wouldn't even know they were there. Overall this hotel is perfect if you are looking to stay in wakiki and don't want to pay the ridiculous prices for resort hotels. I could stay here for a week and the price would be about ten times lower than other hotels. I cannot say enough about this hotel.

He did give us 4 hand towels to dry with.The beds are really hard it made my back hurt where it was hard to walk the next day. It is nice to have a kitchen in the room, but it would be nice to have a light above the sink instead of turning on the big light. Just a suggestion oh and also a larger trash can for larger items that needs to be thrown away. Lucky we had a larger bag to place the trash in. And in the shower maybe place some type of holder for our wash cloth or even the amenities on the shower floor.I did ask for a late checkout and it took them until we were ready to checkout to tell us oh don't you need a 1 pm. We were already packed and the bags were In the car. No matter where we stay we always pickup our room and strip the room and yes we leave a tip. Another thing is my mom had eye surgery and so she was resting and the housekeeper came and she only knocked once and didn't even announce who she was and walked in. That's not a good thing. We both are also housekeepers and we all know you knock twice with announcing who you are then slowly open the door. I did ask if you offer medical stays and they just ignored what I was asking. I'm not to sure if you do, but it would have been helpful. Communication is always the number one key.

I can see that the interior shower used to be blue but was painted over completely in white, some of the white paint pealed off revealing the blue tiles.There was hair on the bathroom sink counter, clearly visible on the white dish. There were remnants of roaches on behind the sink faucet. Neither my family or I felt comfortable walking around the bathroom on our bare feet so we actually wore our flip flops in the shower.Our room had a kitchenette, there was old food stuck on the sink catcher. Not sure why there were 2 mini fridges in the room, the one in the kitchenette was working but the one in the TV cabinet was not and it smelled like mildew.The bed was very uncomfortable, we can feel every bed spring digging into our body with every movement. Not to mention the hole in the sheets and the dirty blanket laid on top (there's no comforter, just dirty brown blanket).This hotel is no where near resort quality yet we were charged and $18 Resort Fee.There entire room had layers of paint that accumulated over the years, cracks were everywhere. We had a rather large patio area on the 1st floor but there were debris and cigarette butts everywhere. The view faced boarded up buildings, we had a second window that faced the hotel parking lot.When we asked the front desk for a parking pass ($25/night) he stated that he wasn't sure that there was anymore parking spots. The security guard was there (he was just hanging around the front desk not securing anything) said that there was one spot left the last he checked. But for whatever reason the Front Desk then told us the parking lot was full and that we would need to park at the Skyline hotel down the street for $35 a night!! My husband ended up parking our car on the street 5 blocks away! On his stroll back to the hotel at 11pm, he got solicited by a prostitute, that's how he found out that the strip club was next door.YES there's strip club next door! We barely slept because it was so loud, it was very rowdy outside with partygoers. We were so paranoid that someone would jump the fence and break into the room!We couldn't wake up early enough and high-tail it out the door.One good thing was the daytime front desk staff. They were pleasant and helpful and gave us Early Check-In. We were initially checked into a Single King Bed when I requested 2 Beds on the reservation. They quickly righted the situation and put us in a room with 2 Beds. I asked them at checkout if they had a business center, there isn't one but she was happy to help up check-in our flights online and print out the boarding pass. I used to work in the hotel industry so I know that they did the best they could with what was given to them.

This room provided me with enough to enjoy left overs with the stove and fridge, get a good night sleep with my fiancee that had a clean bed to sleep in. It was quite worn down but overall I've been to way worse for double the money in los angeles and so this was a fair room for the low cost. Simple things like the bluray playstation with netflix and hulu in the room and the flat screen tv make the room a little nicer. Also the fridge was slightly larger than the average college apartment fridge so we could fit the tall bottles of water in there and it worked very well. The AC also worked extremely well. All the rooms have balcony's ours had alot of bird poop but with some shoes on you could still sit outside. Be sure to get a floor higher than the 3rd so you have some view. It's worth a few extra bucks. If you plan on walking around and being a tourist the location of this place can't be beat. The city bus stops right in front and it's $2.50 to ride it very cheap. The location is the best as far as I'm concerned even if the rooms are a bit run down. It's right next to one of the top ten restaurants in the U.S the udon noodle place. I ate there nearly every morning and I'm not a noodle guy especially for breakfast but made our mornings awesome there. The beach isn't far and your next door to two small nightclubs which were not overly loud and didn't prevent our sleep. But if you just wanted to hear some jams and have a beer or cocktail you didn't have to walk far. Be sure to ask around don't be afraid to talk to the bus driver and ask them how you get somewhere you can travel most of oahu on the city bus and when you see the fairs for taxi or uber you'll understand why I'm saying take the bus. It stops in front of the hotel. The #2 it's $2.50 to ride bring cash per person and you get 2 connections for free. So We went to the north shore for 2.50 got on at the hotel and returned to the hotel for 2.50 it's fast comes every 15 minutes and doesn't waste time getting somewhere probably the fastest bussing in the U.S that i have every used from new york to LA.

We stayed at PH 1791 room.We would like to reinforce the good things that we saw there and also we want to tell you the experience that we had that was not that good and also some suggestions to you. Overall, for sure we will be back to your hotel and we highly recommend it to our friends. Positive points:1- Your front desk is great. Everybody there are very friendly and they help us with all our questions. I had a good experience with all especially with Paula, she was amazing. 2- The green program was awesome! I did it and I was very happy to help to be green and they came to change our sheets on Wednesday and everything else I took care. It was great and on the top of that we got a voucher for 5.00 to use at the restaurant at the lobby. It was a great program. Suggestions:1- I would like to have a recycling trash bag in my room because I was cleaning the room and I put all the plastic containers and paper at the regular trash and if I had a recycling bin, I could put it separately from the regular trash and help more the environment. Bad Experience.1- One day before we leave I had a very scare experience at the elevator. I took the elevator around 6:50pm with a gentleman, and after the door closed he looked at me and he asked me here was my husband. I told him that he was at the elevator waiting for me and he looked at me and he said: Did you know that you can disappeared and I can take you anywhere I want? I was so scared and he left at the 14th floor. I went to the 17th floor and I started to cry. Me and my husband went downstairs and we reported what happened and the front desk was waiting for the management to check the video cameras. Luckily on Saturday morning we were preparing to leave and I went to the front desk and I saw the guy again, and I follow him and he had a van parked at Kurio street almost in front of the hotel, I called an employee from the front desk and he came with me and he took a picture of the guy and his van and he asked if he was a guest at the hotel, and he said yes, but the number of the room that he gave did not exist and he gave another room number that matches. He was smelling alcohol on Friday night.2- The second bad experience was with the Shuttle that should be around every 30 to 40 minutes and we were waiting for the driver for an hour. We were tracking him in our phone and he was not following the schedule. I spoke with the front desk and they could not do anything about because they did not have a phone number that they could contact the driver. When the shutter arrived I told the drive that we were waiting for him for 1 hour and he said that I was lying and from this point on, he was very rude.Final observation: Even with this 2 bad experience, we will be back because overall the good experience was much better and bigger than this 2 experience, but we would like to tell you what happened because this way you can know and you can improve this kind of situation. Have a great day from the Adachi’s","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","O1660ZYmarcosa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",1,4.0

We were greeted by friendly staff and our room was bright, clean and inviting. The kitchen area was fully stocked with everything we needed to cook (though in truth, given that we were so close to so many amazing restaurants in Waikiki we only used it once for leftovers!) and we felt very at home-- the little welcome package of chocolate, cookies and waters was an especially nice touch! The free DVD rentals was a really cool addition, too.

Otherwise, I would not stay here again.We were booked here through an organization for work. I knew through the TripAdvisor reviews that the place might not be so so.In practically every way, this building needs work. I understand that this is not a luxury hotel, however, It just seemed grimy and in need of some basic repairs. It's just so tired.The light above the door to our room was missing the panel so the bulbs and wires were exposed. The hall carpets need to be cleaned. The elevator carpets need to be cleaned. The room carpets need to be cleaned. Everything in the room has been painted, including the shower tiles, and there is peeling paint in many places. The shower floor (that also has been painted over) just seemed grimy - I wore my flip flops in the shower. The bathroom area is very small especially for two people sharing a room. The room was very small with two double beds. There are few outlets for charging phones, etc. The kitchenette area included a convenient fridge and old and grimy stove. The sliding glass door had a shaky lock on it, but the glass was spotless. The beds were comfortable enough with ok linens. The pillows were about 2 inches thick and were obviously quite old. Thankfully, the AC worked well. The nightclubs in the area are noisy and we could hear them on the 15th floor. The first night there, while just being dropped off at the front door, my husband was asked if he wanted to buy ""weed."" This was in about the 10 feet from the car to the front door of the hotel. Check in seemed to take quite awhile and they seemed to be unaware of the deal the travel agency made with our room that included breakfast in the place next door, etc. There is an ""amenity"" or ""resort"" fee - a ripoff - that included movies (we didn't use) and internet (that should just be included). We were given cards to get beach towels and they seemed to be overly nervous about getting these junky towels back (or they will assess you a $30 fee!) However, all the staff seemed friendly. Our room was cleaned the first morning but mysteriously not cleaned the second day, even when I called in the afternoon and was assured they would get to us. Probably the biggest ""pro"" about this place is that it is one street away from excellent shopping and the beach. And, as far as places go on Waikiki, it seems to be low priced. Our employer paid for it. If it had been up to me, we would not have stayed here. Just too many red flags in these reviews and they are all true. At one time this might have been a very nice place.

For a single night, the price was a bit more than we had planned to spend, but the alternatives were far more expensive. Upon arrival at 11:00 PM for check-in, we were told, ""Sorry, the air for the hotel is out and nothing we can do. We'll waive the resort fee of $18 and change, or you can find a different hotel."" We had to be at airport at 5:30 AM, so scouring a city full of spring break partiers looking for a vacancy wasn't really in the cards. The room was showing some age, but overall it was clean. After some struggle, we got the balcony door open, but there wasn't much breeze. The hotel didn't even offer a fan to move the air, so after a sleepless night and a cold shower to rinse off the sweat, we were back to the airport and ended up sleeping on the plane, instead.","Atlanta, Georgia","tat2dheart</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",0,2.0

Chose this hotel specifically for the low cost and location. However, I now regret doing so. Several problems. 1. PARKING DRIVEWAY is a ridiculously sharp curve downhill ramp which has solid concrete walls on both sides. In other words, IMPOSSIBLE to drive through with a large car. I had a small car, so not a problem for me, HOWEVER, The terminal to open the gate or speak to a staff member is ridiculously difficult to reach due to the awkward curve of the driveway. At this time, it was a HEAVY DOWNPOUR. I literally had to get out of my car to push the button to speak to a staff member. Immediately was told by staff, ""Parking is sold out"". Informed staff I was a guest and had a room reservation. Was told, ""Sorry, please park at Aqua Skyline"" (which is about a 10 minute walk). Informed staff that it is raining hard, I have no umbrella, and would have to walk very far. Staff stated, ""sorry, nothing I can do about it"". Parked at Aqua Skyline, which was $30 just for 1 night. Don't even get me started on the terrible parking structure there. 2. Security guard was absolutely rude to my wife. I dropped her off along with our luggage to the hotel prior to me driving to the other Aqua's hotel for parking. From what she told me, she sat inside the lobby and a man attempted to enter the front door (which is locked in the evening). He began knocking on the door and kept motioning for my wife to open it. My wife opened it for her and then a security confronted her afterwards stating, ""don't ever open the door for anyone. got it?"" Very rude approach. Wife stated another person attempted to walk in and knocked on the door repeatedly. The security guard just sat and ignored it instead of telling them they can't enter. My wife was disturbed by each person attempting to enter. 3. After parking in the other hotel 10 minutes away and walking in the heavy rain (I was SOAKED), we finally checked in. Immediately upon entering the room, we were bombarded by a very strong smell which I can only describe as a mixture of old fish and bleach. There is a cooking stove in the unit which I can imagine has been used to cook (of course, the room will smell like what others have cooked in the past).4. Room is nowhere near sound proof.

I was super excited to finally be able to have a whole relaxing day with my boyfriend before a Christmas party that night. Then at 10 morning when we arrived that day, the front desk suddenly told us that they didn't have a room prepared and that we need to come back at 3 in the afternoon. We understand that there are lots of tourists that occupy the hotel and that the rooms need to be cleaned before another guest occupies it but they could have at least included (in the email) that there was a certain check-in time instead of telling guests on the spot. On the bright side, they offered to hold our bags for us at the front desk til the actual check-in time. Roamed around Waikiki for literally 5 hours and finally got to check in. Finally..The room was pretty good. Everything was neat and we were glad there was a game console to keep us entertained. Amenities are already included. You can rent up to 2 DVDs max. Got to enjoy the pool as well some time the day after.Only downsides about the room/hotel is the shower. It was hard to get it at a good temperature. It was either freezing cold or burning hot. We literally had to tweak it or adjust the knobs in small centimeters just to get it at a good temperature and for it to not suddenly change temps while we're showering. Also, we ended up waking super early because there was loud construction which sounded like it was coming from above the hotel. So much for getting a good night's sleep after partying.. Also, we didn't realize til that morning that our coffeemaker was broken.

Do not be fooled by the pictures on the website. The ""Upgraded"" rooms are not represented accurately. Popcorn ceilings, tiny tiny shower that sits 12 inches away from the toilet, dirty walls, glass sliding door locks were busted but its ok they provided a small piece of metal to shove through a hole in order to ""lock"" the door. There are gaps around the door big enough that we could see into the hallway when the door was closed. The best way I can describe the room is the feeling of an old run down college dormitory, everything is old, everything feels dirty and you have to wear sandals in the shower.On our second morning we found bugs in the bed. Immediately requested a new room, which was granted immediately. We then received a phone call as we were packing up our current room telling us we had to go back to the lobby so that a staff member could inspect to confirm there were bugs before they would give us a new room. 30 minutes later we started the process of packing and moving again. We both had bite marks which made us feel like our skin was crawling the rest of the stay, not what I would call a very relaxing experience.The second night the fire alarm went off, which in and of itself is not a big deal, however the interaction we had with the staff was alarming. When the alarm went off, we left through the stairwell and exited the building through the only doorway at the bottom of the stairwell, an ""emergency exit"" door. We were greeted by a hotel staff member telling us ""You can't leave through this door, it sets off an alarm"". The fire alarm was very obvious outside of the building, I explained that there was already an alarm, and we left using the stairs as is protocol for any fire alarm. He said, no you are supposed to use the elevators at the front of the building. I explained to him three times that no, elevators are not supposed to be used in a fire alarm. He walked away when other people started filing out of the emergency exit door, either not wanting to confront 15 other people, or finally realizing that he was wrong. This is pretty much fire safety 101.I would understand some of the above if this hotel was half the price of others I looked at in the area, however, this is only marginally less expensive than some of the highest rated hotels in the area.

Farther from the beach than we thought, have to walk through big hotels and construction sites to get to it. On a busy street, sirens all day/night. Bottom line, noisy, old, worn, dirty.

Having done some considerable overseas travelling already this year , I was looking to keep my costs down , and , being a solo traveller, wanted to also cater for myself in an apartment style room . Plus points of the hotel first :A clean , good sized room with a comfortable double bed ( though I disliked the pillows ) . The kitchenette was EXCELLENTLY equipped with everything provided , including a microwave . The bathroom was adequate if not luxurious . The free WiFi was very good , and there were a reasonable amount of channels on the TV . The air conditioning worked fine , and I enjoyed having a balcony with outdoor chairs and a table . I was particularly impressed with the ( half hourly ) free shuttle bus service provided . Actually , I initially stayed on board the bus for its full circular tour , because ( being a first timer in Honolulu ) I needed to see the places it stopped at en route . I then used it on a regular basis as it went everywhere I personally wanted to go .I found the location of the hotel ( backed up by the shuttle bus ) to be very good , There are many eateries within easy walking distance , as and when needed . There is also a well stocked ABC convenience store virtually opposite the Hotel for any snacks and drinks needed at short notice .The staff were universally friendly and most helpful . They cheerfully organised a cheap fixed-fare taxi for me to get to the airport at the end of my stay .The only negative about this hotel is the fairly late check-in time , with apparently no provision for early arrivals . If you land early in the morning at the airport , you have no option but to wait for hours in the ( not very large ) lobby . All of which means that when the check-in time actually arrives , the crush of people at the two check-in stations becomes acutely unpleasant , and it takes an eternity !Having survived the check-in process , I then began to enjoy my stay at the hotel , and what it offered . I have no hesitation in recommending it .","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Jim J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",64,3.0

The bed was very uncomfortable, and they only used a top sheet on the mattress that would come up in the middle of the night. The chairs were very old and uncomfortable, and there was no comfortable place to sit and watch TV together, so we would put pillows and blankets on the VERY hard floor. Our room was right next to a construction site, and between the noise from that and the uncomfortable mattress, we didn't sleep well our entire trip. One day we were so desperate we even looked around for affordable massages to get the kinks out of our necks and backs. The bathroom was also very small, with just a tiny stall shower with an awkwardly placed shower head. The bathroom door was also falling apart, since it was a cheap one with laminate over the composite wood, and the laminate was splintering and peeling off at the top. The room also smelled really weird when we arrived, and we found out later that it was the AC; whenever it was on, the room smelled funky. If we had the sliding door to the balcony open, it aired out pretty quickly. I've seen the other Aqua hotels around Waikiki, and they are all much nicer than this place. This hotel needs a serious renovation, and quickly. Overall, I felt like they were asking for too much for what we got and we were very disappointed since we wanted something better on our honeymoon. Very little romance was had in this room because we were so uncomfortable. I would not stay here again if given a choice.

I know the issues that they all face and can make a comparison. For an older property, I would say that they are doing well with this one. They have made soft upgrades such as painting and bedding. Why do millions in upgrades for a budget property. It's clean and the beds are comfortable. It does not have black-out curtains, so you really need to sleep when it gets dark (like people in Hawaii do). The shower grout appears to be dirty, but this is normal with people using the shower with sand on their feet. The bath was perfectly clean. The location can't be beat, if you wish to be close to shopping and dining (across from the International Marketplace). It's a couple of blocks to the beach. It's also right on Kuhio Avenue, which is where The Bus (the city bus) runs through Waikiki. For a two star property it does very well in its class. For those from the Mainland, you can't compare Motel 6 prices with Hawaii prices. For those that are unhappy with the ""old"" building, let me tell you, there are far worse!

On Saturday, we arrived to check-in approximately 2:30 in the afternoon. The front desk clerk advised that our room was still being cleaned and that it will not be ready until 3:00. She, however, was able to check us in and gave us our parking pass. When we returned half an hour later, there was a line of guests also trying to check-in so we waited for our turn. At about 3:15, we were able to talk with her and again was told that our room was still not ready and that it was being ""updated"". I told her that we will be at the waiting area and to please let us know as soon as it's ready. We waited another 15 minutes and finally decided to stay in line again. When it was our turn, we were told that our reservation for a studio with 2 beds was not available and that she was going to place us into a regular 2-bed room or if we chose to, we can stay in a studio room with 1-bed and a roll-away. We have 4 guests in our party so we knew that the latter option was not going to work. With no other options, we took the 2-bed room and she offered to waive the hospitality fees for our stay. When we got to our room, we found that it was much smaller than a normal bedroom in other hotels, the bathroom and kitchen counter had water spots on them, the bathroom floor was very sticky, the shower curtain had a musty smell, the shower floor drain cover was rusty, one portion of the kitchen counter just above the refrigerator was cracked and if one accidentally rubs on it, may get cut/hurt, the left door hinge of the drawer door was broken and the throw pillows were dirty. This was not what our expectation was from a hotel that promises comfort based on their website and definitely not a place where we would want to spend our vacation. We then went back to the front desk, told them our dissatisfaction of our room and that we be moved to a studio with 2 beds as soon as one comes available. This was on a Saturday and we were told that one will not be available until Monday. We agreed to it not wanting to stay much longer in that room in spite of the inconvenience of having to pack up all our luggage to be moved to another room. On Monday, we were then moved to a studio with 2 beds, which was much better and roomier but still had a musty shower curtain smell, dust on table which was very visible (the one by the sliding doors especially when the window covers are drawn open), dirty throw pillows and the water temperature is not constant (it can all of a sudden turn scalding hot or very cold). The housekeeping of the rooms definitely needs a lot of improvement. The Friday we were there, we left early in the morning, came back at around 2:30 and our room was still not cleaned. We left and returned that night and our towels were just laying on the bed, showers were not fully cleaned, found a mosquito on the shower wall and counter tops were still dirty. We also left a used tea cup in the kitchen sink and it was still there unwashed when we returned. The parking lots are also very inefficient especially the upstairs since there is no two-way traffic. Cars need to back out to get out of the lot, which is very dangerous. $25/day parking fee is absolutely excessive. When we got our final bill, we found that we were charged the same price per night for the first 2 days of our stay for the regular 2-bed room as the studio, which was unacceptable. The waiving of the hospitality fee does not make up for the price difference. There is no hospitality in this hotel and a hospitality fee is definitely not warranted. Needless to say, we will not be returning at this hotel or recommending it to anyone.","Stockton, California","queenjoy7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockton, California</strong>",3,1.0

I was a little surprised as I had spoken with someone at the hotel who told me that the building had recently been converted from condos a little over a year ago. I suppose I had been expecting something a little fresher/newer. I checked in at around 11am but was told my room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. I kept my fingers crossed that the room was better than the lobby indicated.Unfortunately, my room had a number of problems: stains on the sheets/pillow as well as the upholstered chairthe ceiling in the bathroom was disintegratinglow pile/cheap carpetingknicked/scratched furniturebathroom sink hot water faucet would not turnlow quality and dated furnishingsfelt dirtyI thought that I could suck it up and get through, but the morning after my first night I found a bug (cockroach?) next to my bathroom sink. I hurried to get my phone to take a photo, but by the time I returned, the bug was gone. I decided then and there that I needed to find another place to stay.When I told the front desk that I had found a bug in my room and wanted to cancel the rest of my stay, I did not get any kind of apology. When I asked for help in transferring my reservation to another Aqua property, I was basically told that I had to do it myself. They were not able to transfer the money that I had paid for six nights to the new property, so at one point in time I was paying for twelve nights total (even though it was only going to be an additional five).If you are looking for a cheap hotel in a good location, this place is for you. If you are looking for a clean property with some nice amenities and a service oriented staff, I would highly recommend you look for another spot.","San Francisco, California","Lisa S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",6,2.0

The rooms are quite outdated and because of this they do not feel very clean, there is only so much you can get an old white shower to 'look' clean. We were travelling with our 9 month old son and the room was bright and quite noisy due to light curtains and construction going on in the surrounds, so wouldn't recommend if you have young ones that require naps or early bedtimes.The pro's were super friendly and helpful staff, a dvd machine to rent limitless movies, good location and a free shuttle to Ala Moana shopping centre (if you're into shopping). There was also complimentary wifi but it kept dropping out (maybe because we were up on the 15th floor)?We stayed in July, so being peak season the room was still quite expensive.... a little too pricey for what you got perhaps but like i said, location was good.",,Meagan H,1,3.0

We booked a room with two beds and a kitchenette. The room itself was decent, but very outdated. The water in the bathtub wasn't draining well and because the curtain was narrow (half a size of a bathtub) the water would splash everywhere, even though we tried to be as careful as possible. We like to sleep in, so we would wake up at around 8am and cook some light breakfast, leaving room between 9am and 930am. At that point, leaving so late, we pretty much could forget about the room being cleaned. It's like you see the ladies in the hallway, they ask you if you need your room cleaned, you say ""yes, please"", you come back after 5 pm and the room is not touched at all. I tried to take the trash out myself daily and we reused our towels every day. The room got cleaned twice during our 10 day stay. Other than that, the front desk folks were friendly and helpful. The hotel is small and cozy, the swimming pool is small, but really nice. Basically, you get what you pay for.Oh, the location is great and that was the main reason for booking this property.","Fairbanks, Alaska","Elena A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairbanks, Alaska</strong>",1,3.0

To say it is charming does not do it justice. I came to stay a week and did not want to spend giant money to stay on waikiki beach. besides most my time away from the hotel was on the windward side. The staff could not be more friendly, always smiling and always happy, whats not to be happy they live in hawaii. They made me feel like, well like they were really glad I was their guest. Now I get what they mean by the ""Aloha Spirit"" When I came back from my daily excursions it was always, ""How did it go today"". The concierge I thought was first rate, just as friendly and helpful as everyone else there. They even hooked me up with some free things I would never have done had I not spoken with them first. My room was HUGE and super comfortable, and every time I came back from my excursions, clean towels and a made bed always greater me. I guess its the little things that they provided that made my stay so great. You guys made my vacation!!! can't wait to come back.

The Ohia is dead-smack in the middle of everything going on in Waikiki. The beach is only a 5 min. walk away, and restaurants are lines up on either sides of the walkways. If you're into tours, most tour buses pick up passengers right in front of the hotel, and the public transit buses stop on the curb on the other side of the main entrance.

Beachfront hotels, where I had stopped previously on holidays, were simply out of the budget - so I looked at hotels set back into Waikiki. Aqua Ohia seemed to have a very good location one street off the main boulevard - and the rooms were very reasonably priced with Free Wifi and a not-entirely unreasonable garage parking fee. The booking was simple and there were no charges set against my credit card in advance. On arrival, the room was ready and exactly what I'd asked for. Initially, parking was a bit confusing, as you can't access the underground car park until you have a room key, and on-street parking is fairly scarce. However, the garage itself had plenty of spaces and although one has to enter the garage through a door on the front outside of the hotel (via a small set of steps), you always remained under cover. The staff is friendly and the hotel is being modernised. The shower was clean, although a bit a throwback to the 1970s (which I kind of liked, to be honest). My room was on the 7th floor and had windows facing two sides, which was great. The hotel itself is in a lively 'nightlife' area (I'd not call it seedy as others have - its just normal big city). There were several good restaurants nearby of virtually any ethnic variety. The hotel itself will soon have a cafe attached (Big Kahuna) - as it was in final preparations as I was there. The room did get a bit noisy on Friday and Saturday nights from the tourist antics in the local establishments - however, the rest of the week was absolutely peaceful.  I'm absolutely please with the hotel and actually may use it for a holiday later this year. It's a 5 minute walk from the beach and nearly 1/2 the price of beachfront hotels.","London, United Kingdom","markbrammer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",23,3.0

I chose this hotel because it was close to the start of the half marathon we were running. This made the morning of the run stress free. There are many different places to eat that are within walking distance and a grocery store also.2) Parking. There was always ample parking and the front desk staff were very helpful parking our car for us.3) The managers reception. It was wonderful to hear live music and have adult refreshments in the lobby. I met the supervisors and hotel managers. I wish the reception was more frequently throughout the week.4) The suite. Our room was on the higher floors above the busy streets and provided views of Waikiki and Diamond Head. I rarely heard any noise from the hallway considering we were close to the elevator on our floor.5) The kitchenette. We didn't use the oven but it was nice to know we had the option. The stove top was helpful in providing hot water for my coffee press and cooking meals.6) The pool. Because the pool was a salt water pool, I didn't experience the itching I would usually have after a dip in a chlorinated pool. It also helped ease my aches after the run.7) The front desk. Everyone was extremely helpful and kind. Our requests were always met with a smile and always fulfilled. My key card would occasionally not function and the staff were there to issue my replacement. There were times that the lobby was busy with what appeared to be Chinese tourists. Avoid these times as it can be really loud in the lobby.8) The housekeeping. Our room was clean. The sheets were crisp. The towels were soft and requests for additional linen were quickly met. The toiletries were great.9) The laundry. I'm accustomed to using the shower to wash and dry my running clothes when I stay at hotels but having a laundry that was secure freed my time to go around Waikiki instead.10) The ice machine. Had I known that the ice machine was in the lobby, I would have brought a cooler as the ice bucket provided is small. I only really used the ice machine the first day because our drinks were not yet cold in the fridge.11) The fridge. It was great having a mini fridge to keep all my sports drink cold and our left over food from spoiling. This fridge is large enough to keep a decent size container of food.12) The morning paper. I appreciate having the morning paper available while drinking my morning coffee.13) The overall service. I would stay here again and recommend to my friends and coworkers.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Sherwin A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",11,4.0
