The hotel was so nice and clean, also the staffs were very friendly and helpful, they gave us the direction to the skytree ( we could walk to there for 15mins:)), and made a reservation for french restaurant there. Especially, the bath room was gorgeous!! We stayed at corner twin room. Half-open bath was so nice with fresh air but bit cold in this season. It must be wonderful in spring to see Cherry blossam, river, and Tokyo skytree from balcony. I heard there is a fireworks festival in summer over the river. The Access to Asakusa downtown is so good, about 10 mins walk. Definitely recommend!!","Lake Tahoe (California), California","eric11290</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lake Tahoe (California), California</strong>",0,5.0
