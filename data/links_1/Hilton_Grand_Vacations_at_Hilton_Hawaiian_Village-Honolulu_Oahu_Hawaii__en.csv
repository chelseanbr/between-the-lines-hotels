We stayed in the one bedroom suite partial ocean view and LOVED it!! Most evenings we sat out on the balcony and watched the beautiful ocean, lagoon and a few nights of private luaus on the grass below. The kitchen was stocked with almost everything we needed. It was just my husband and I so we ate out evenings, but it was nice to have things for breakfast and snacks ready. This would be perfect for families to save and cook their meals in the hotels. We were in the lagoon tower by the way. We also commented that the insolation was so good in our room, we never even heard anyone in the hallways.We loved having so many shops to walk around so close to the hotel - the village has a little of everything. We ate at the Blue Shrimp the first night we got in and were surprised at the quality and decent prices! And of course Lapperts was a frequent stop.We just enjoyed everything so much!!Even the last day was so pleasant, we had a late flight out and were able to check our bags in with the bellhop and walk around Waikiki and play on the beach then shower and print our boarding passes in the lounge provided for just that circumstance.

Check in was a breeze, less than 10 minutes. The Bell Desk delivered our luggage immediately. We had a corner room on the 12th floor. The room was well stocked with the exception of a needed blender, which was requested and delivered timely from housekeeping. No kitchen towels were supplied. The room was clean with the exception of the doors which needed a good cleaning. The doors were white and had finger prints and dirt that was extremely visible. I did wipe down the doors as the Corona Virus is spreading and I was concerned with the germs. The Luau and fireworks shows were enjoyed from our balconies, what a nice treat. We had an incredible view of the ocean and saw several Whales from our balcony as well. We attended the Big Game (super bowl) party at the Tapa Bar. The location was good as the kids could remain at the pool and were visible from our seats. . However, the food could have been better and was cold by half time with no heat on the Chaffing Dishes. Lappert's Ice Cream by our Tower was great, although pricey we still enjoyed 4 times. We utilized the National Car Rental onsite 1 day, which was easy to reserve.

From our 11th floor room, we enjoyed lovely sunrises, sunsets and views of the lagoon! The front desk staff was absolutely superb and checkin was very quick and efficient. However, the valet staff is especially deserving of special lauding as they were ALWAYS amazingly quick in bringing our car....but do note valet parking is not cheap! There is a self park option but we decided to treat ourselves! We last stayed at the Lagoon Tower over a decade ago and the property, while beautiful, needs a refurbishment as the room decor and common areas such as the hallways and elevators are in need of a makeover which is due to how busy this property is year wide and how difficult it is to take down rooms or areas to refurbish! The Hilton Hawaiian Village is HUGE! Besides countless stores and too many restaurants to count or mention...there are numerous (5 I think) pools, a lagoon which offers paddle boats, surfing lessons, kayaks and other forms of entertainment and of course a beautiful stretch of beach on the famous Waikiki Beach. The super pool was unfortunately always very cold which explains why it was also always, relatively speaking, fairly uncrowded. Our favorite pool, The Paradise Pool, was located right next to the Lagoon Tower and was always packed. The pool includes several water slides, two hot tubs, a waterfall or two and a small grill offering hamburgs, hotdogs, a few Hawaiian staples such as Kalua pork sandwiches, and drinks. This pool was significantly warmer than any other pool on property explaining why it was always packed and why finding a chair after 9:30am was almost impossible. The most significant issue with this pool was the failure of the staff to enforce posted rules. Although there were security personnel present and the hot tubs had signs clearly stating in English and Japanese that the maximum occupancy was 9 people, I often counted upwards of 17 - 20 people in the hot tubs. This was not an infrequent issue but constant unless you used the hot tubs early in the morning! Something needs to be done as this level of occupancy is both unsafe and unsanitary! It is also annoying as parents bring infants, very young children jump into the hot tubs, teenagers congregate and adults can often barely maintain a space. There is no control and there is going to be a very unfortunate accident unless something is done to enforce the occupancy standards especially when counting 9 people in the hot tubs is fairly easy to do and enforce! Another issue involved a lack of coordination of Hilton Honor perks. We were never given or informed of a mythical passport book, which offers numerous discounts throughout the massive Hilton Hawaiian Village, until two days into our stay and purely by accident. And when we did find out about this program, the books were still using the 2019 books even though it was two months into the new year. This resulted in our missing at least four opportunities to save 10 - 15% on meals we had consumed in the Hilton Hawaiian Village which were all quite expensive. The books should be included with the the packet of information provided at checkin and not have to be discovered by visiting the concierge.The last major issue involved the perks offered to HGVC Owners after attending an owners update. I completely understand HGVC sales is a separate and independent beast from the Lagoon Tower!! However we were offered a experience card and told it offered 20% savings on food purchased at ALL restaurants in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and select restaurants out in town on both Oahu and Hawaii (Kona specifically) AND 15% savings on ALL merchandise and activities purchased at the shops in the Hilton Hawaiian Village and out in town at select stores on Oahu and Hawaii (again specifically Kona). Needless to say these promises were all lies as this card was not recognized at most of the restaurants on property and was not even recognized by one of the Lagoon Tower Resort Managers. As a long-time HGVC Elite member I should have known better! However, senior managers should know what perks are being offered by the sales team! Kudos to Resort Manager Sausito Sato for taking the time to walk with me to various places to try and find out about the card offered by the sales team. He was extremely patient and willing to even walk to a restaurant to try and address the issue with me. He exemplified the traditions and values espoused by Conrad Hilton more than any other staff member I encountered and should be lauded for his absolutely superb customer service!

It is actually a 1 x bedroom suite that interconnects with a twin studio room. It was absolutely fantastic and suited our needs perfectly. We had ample space and the kitchen meant we had a coffee machine and refrigerator to store snacks etc. The kitchen could do with a top up of items such a cutlery and tea towels as its very bare. We didn’t cook our own food but if you wanted to you would find it very difficult with the limited utensils in the room. We couldn’t even find a tray to heat up pizza! The food in the village is all over prized rubbish food that is typical of hawaii, chips, burgers and salads that are 90% lettuce. There is limited food options outside of the village nearby and its at least a 15-20 min walk to anything semi decent food wise. However the lagoon pool was fantastic for families. Has 3 slides and is heated to a lovely warm temperature so our kids literally spent all day there. As long as u are down at the pool by about 10.30am u can always get a sunlounger. I had read many reviews complaining about the wait for elevators, we had no such problem! All in all a great stay but a bit let down by a lack of nutritious food options at a reasonable price. But the room and amenities at the hotel were fantastic. If u like to ear burgers, hot dogs and fries all week at twice the price then you will be right at home.

A van came to the hotel and took us over to the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Our representative Julie was amazing to say the least. The inventory rep Chris was also excellent. They both stayed late to get the purchase processed. We did buy and then changed our minds and cancelled later. It was a two hour presentation that became five hours due to the many questions I had, weighing options, paperwork... After additional research upon returning to our hotel room, we decided to cancel as we were unsure about the amount of points and the home resort we bought into. Home resort is a big factor if travelling during holiday season (priority booking).However, the biggest drawbacks are the fees associated to any transaction (to book your points, roll your points , transfer your points...) and parking fees. Their motto is “you only pay for what you use” which isn’t accurate - if you touch your points, it’s going to cost you. Although annual fees seem cheaper than Marriott or Disney vacation clubs, they are comparable to Hilton when transaction fees are added. I haven’t received the refund of my deposit yet so I won’t comment on the cancellation process. If the refund gets processed promptly, I will certainly re-consider buying after visiting their big island resorts. Although it’s a no pressure sales presentation, all offers are off the table once you leave. This tactic is rather stupid if you ask me. It would be much wiser to give people 48 hours otherwise it’s just a waste of everybody’s time when someone buys only to cancel later. So we had to buy in order to think on it.Their presentation is quite well done but I would prefer an opportunity to research the points charts and benefits of various resorts on my own before deciding. Upon pulling up all the vacation club resorts in Hawai’i, I found that all the studio suites only hold 2 people. This was the deciding factor in cancelling as both Marriott and Disney have 4 person occupancy in their studios. I did ask to see a studio suite but was never shown one. Their new tower Grand Islander has beautiful suites. We have stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village before and very much enjoyed our stay. Hence our interest in their vacation club. There are many benefits like no expiration of Hhonor points and open season rates (last minute rates only for vacation club owners).If you’re serious about buying, plan to be there for about 4 hours and do some research ahead of time.","Vancouver, Canada","LUXST</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",77,4.0

Check in was easy, the staff brought bags up to our room along with a crib. Our 1 king bed oceanview room was spacious enough for the 4 of us (1 child on the sofa bed) and we had a great view. The room felt quite dated, especially compared to photos we'd seen before visiting and it wasn't exactly spotlessly clean with thick layers on dust on top of the fridge & light shades. There were also rips in some of the bedsheets which was a little disappointing given how much we had spent on this accommodation. Maybe not a big issue for some, and to be honest it seemed to be the norm in Hawaii and then in California afterwards, but there is no recycling option! We only had a garbage bin in our kitchen, and don't get me started on those plastic bags with coffee whitener and sugar in them. It's very old school and completely unnecessary in this day and age when the environment is such a big topic. But hey doesn't appear to be in the US! anyway, the other thing we REALLY didn't enjoy was the daily sales pitch and push to attend a presentation where they try and sell you a condo. Can they not just ask you once and if you decline make a note on their computer system that you've already been asked? Back to the positives, we loved being right on Waikiki beach and having the lagoon, as well as all the shops and restaurants on your doorstep. I very much enjoyed the poke bowl at Tropics Grill. All the extras are very expensive eg 50USD for an hour on a pedal boat?! So factor that in if you're booking. We also attended the lu'au one evening which was worth it for the experience. With experiences like the lu'au or a spa treatment it's worth waiting until you're at the village before booking as you can get a money off voucher.

We stayed in the Lagoon tower and were upgraded to a far superior room than we had booked (2 bdrm/2 bath/ocean view/kitchen/living room) - it goes without saying that the suite was 5 stars. Immaculate, modern, spacious, elegantly decorated with a well appointed full kitchen (dishwasher, full oven, microwave, garburator, full sized fridge, everything necessary for basic cooking and eating including silverware, mugs, glasses, etc.) This tower was definitely quieter than others and had a short check-in time (we had no wait at 9 pm). The concierge and other staff were personable, friendly and attentive at all times. We have been to Waikiki several times with children and stayed in a variety of places along the strip. This was a first 'resort experience' in Waikiki and I doubt we will ever choose anything but this. The property is far enough away from the strip that it isn't completely overrun with crowds. Most people on site seemed to be actual hotel guests which builds in a safety and community feel. The grounds are immaculate and gorgeous, with a variety of shops (including ABC), restaurants and activities (music, fireworks, luau, etc.) We felt comfortable letting our teens wander by themselves. We enjoyed Lappert's icecream and coffee, Hatsuhana Japanese food, teppanyaki (a highlight) and the Tapa open air bar at night for live music. Getting to the strip is a bit of walk, but we easily took Uber from the designated Uber pickup location (it's approx a $9USD ride to mid-strip). It's a 10 minute walk to the International Marketplace grocery to stock up, but the on-site ABC has an impressive selection of tourist needs including fresh food and dairy, alcohol, salads, fruit, coffee. The lagoon in the front is perfect. It's drained and cleaned often (we saw staff walking around it with a garbage bag and metal detectors early morning for cleanup). We will definitely stay here again and encourage other families to do so. I took .5 stars off for:- Lack of recycling (I know this is a Hawaii issue, but perhaps some small changes can be made to reduce water bottle and disposable toiletries waste, such as water filters in the rooms or on the floors with water jugs, and soap/shampoo dispensers). It felt terrible throwing away piles of water bottles and plastic). - The beach right in front of the property has coral/stones. Not a huge deal as it's a short walk to better sand, but it's good to know- The parking lot next door to the lagoon by the marina has a small homeless camp set up. There is no locked gate to the parking lot. We were never bothered or concerned for our safety, but it was an unnerving and sad discovery. Again, this is not a Hilton issue, but as a parent it's a good thing to note. I realize that Oahu has a big homeless issue and they are trying to help people. - You have to rent beach chairs and umbrellas. Towels are available for guest use. - The elevators are incredibly busy at checkout times - they send a notice about it. We waited for elevators with our luggage for about 15 minutes as we were on a lower floor and people checking out above us filled them up with luggage at this time. We realized that sending a teen down, then having them take the elevator back up to our floor allowed us to get on into an empty elevator, in order to work our way to the lobby.

This was our first trip back with kids as a family and we stayed on the vacation rental/timeshare side (Lagoon Tower) which we booked via Chase Reward Vacations. We were fortunate to be assigned the 22nd floor and had a 2 bedroom 2 bath booked, which gave us a very spacious condo to enjoy for a week with a view of the marina and ocean. The reservation came with daily cleaning service and pool towels were plentiful at all the locations (though quite worn out). I would say overall it is a super busy like a popular cruise, people are Everywhere so don't expect quiet and peace like the North or West Shore. There are decent restaurants though very pricey (we only ate one time on campus and chose to cook every meal except our first). On resort Starbucks is very popular and expensive (30% more than CA). Pools were chilly in April, but I imagine they would be perfect in the summer. The kids' pool with waterfalls, slides, etc. was literally teeming with children; like way TOO many for me to enjoy being in the water LOL ;-). As a result my kids, who were in there for hours at a time, had a skin rash after a week in the chemical laden pool; they had a ton of fun though so probably to them it was worth it. Lounge chairs were sometimes hard to come by, but if you were patient you'd eventually get one. The beach sand is gritty and tough, so go past the dock/pier where it is much much softer. We indulged in the submarine ride which was a good one time experience and found cheaper fares online, which the staff were willing to match. Overall a cheerful fun atmosphere despite the crowds and costs. One major advantage is the easy walk to Waikiki shopping and eating. Island Vintage Shave Ice stand is truly delicious; fresh fruit flavors that I dare say are better than Matsumoto's (not the mochi rice balls though, tiny and dry). Here are some tips for condo dwellers who plan to cook:1) ask for more plate ware and an extra water pitcher. Filtered water was downstairs and we used our 2 pitchers to avoid paying for bottled water (plus the wasteful plastic).2) kitchen is not as equipped as Marriott Ko Olina in case you are comparing the two. Not as many appliances to choose from or space to cook etc. you will have to make do with an 8"" frying pan (I had to cook pancakes for 3 kids individually Gah!), but if you don't mind being creative it's not terrible.3) Laundry, while not in the suite like Ko Olina, was easily available on the floor. 4) Grabbing a taxi/lyft/etc is easy to get to a decent grocery store (Safeway, Whole Foods is about 10 mins with the traffic) and much better prices. We saved by not renting a car since there is plenty to do around the Waikiki area and we have been to Oahu many times before.5) Ala Moana Shopping Center is a 15 min walk and there are many food courts to choose from. The special Japanese focused one has every type of food prepared so you don't have to cook at all. We walked there and took a taxi back to save some $.We enjoyed ourselves plenty and had a positive experience, but upon reflection we will return to Ko Olina on the West Shore for the quieter resort and better equipped condo. The only thing Ko Olina really lacks is a decent hotel spa in case you want that for your vacay.

I stayed 3 nights and the last night I stayed, we got a burglar came into our room and stole my camera bags with wallets and car key fob in them, and my sister's purses with her and her daughter's passports, wallets with all their identifications on the day she was supposed to fly back to Canada.Long story short, after spending all day dealing with police, embassy and TSA at the airport, she had to spend tons money to change her plane tickets, and we lost over 6K worth stuff (my camera and lenses were more than 4K) while this burglar went out and made so many transactions with our credit cards overnight. Yes, burglary can happen anywhere, but I'm writing this review 40 days after the incident because I'm very disappointed with the hotel. I spoke to the manager, she told me that hotel's insurance company will contact me. I got in touch with them a week later. The insurance company then got back to me that hotel had no fault on this so no compensation will be given.  First of all, Hilton grand vacation doesn't have a key scanner at the elevator. Which means anyone can come to any floors. Also they said they don't have cctv in the hallway which It's hard to believe...not even the elevator area?  secondly, the person broke into the room while we are sleeping! this could have been much worth problem than losing some cameras and wallets. To me this is so obvious that we (two asian ladies with small children) were the target by someone who works there, thinking 1. no man in the room 2. they look like Japanese tourists so they will be gone before they can do anything, which I heard later that this happens a lot downtown to tourists and they can hardly charge anyone even if police catch them..because they are already out of country so they can't work with the case. (additional statements or going to court)  Obviously there was some kind of security bleach on hotel part while they charge me $1535.00 for 3 nights (this include $40 resort fee a day and $45 parking fee a day!). I don't mine spend money for good service and quality accommodation but I also expect they would handle something like this better. I ask question about case to the manager, she tells me to talk to insurance company who doesn't respond my email for over 3 weeks. Very disappointing!","Oahu, Hawaii","Sunjoo K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oahu, Hawaii</strong>",3,1.0

You can’t beat the location on Oahu/Waikiki. The resort is beautifully landscaped with several pools and beach/lagoon access. The staff was friendly and service was excellent. The village includes many shops as well as restaurants. You could spend your entire week just at the resort and have an enjoyable time. That said, please be aware that you will pay for much more than the price of your room. Hawaii is expensive no matter where you go, but nowhere more than this resort. Despite a resort charge of $45/day, you will pay for renting beach items like paddle boards. You will pay $175 for breakfast for a family of 4 and more than that for lunch or dinner onsite. We opted to go to the IHOP or Starbucks instead for breakfast and we were out and about during lunch and some dinners. And if you have a car, which you need on Oahu unless you plan to book tours all over the island, be prepared to pay over $50/day to valet park your car and about $7-10 less to park it yourself. The resort charge covers things like DVD rentals and two waters per day, but for $45/day, I think parking at least should be included. Further, at least for our family, we spent most days exploring the island. I am not going to be renting DVDs to watch in my room when there is so much to see and do. We have stayed here twice and will likely stay here again if we return. We were well aware of the expense having stayed here before. As long as you are aware of what you are financially in for, this is a top notch luxury resort and excellent choice to stay at while in Oahu.

Although we didn't use it because we couldn't resist the balcony view which easily accommodated 4 chairs and a large table. One small little thing which could have been better was that we were registered as 4 adults and 2 children, so they should have known we would be needing the fold out sofa bed? When we arrived we had to pull out the bed, and the mattress didn't have linen. We had to find someone and ask for bedding. A staff member returned quickly with two sheets, one blanket and one pillow. I was told ""Here you are"". After a long flight with 2 small kids we weren't really in the mood to make a bed.

We stayed here 2 years ago and got roughly the same room but on a lower floor. They did accomodate my request for a diamond head view and since we were checking in on a Thursday we couldn't get a higher floor which worked out. Before arriving I sent several packages from Amazon to the hotel. They were delivered however upon checking in with the resort manager they couldn't find the one with the snacks, gopro, chargers etc in it. They had my small packages but somehow they managed to lose a big box. I checked in with them a week after it arrived and they said they couldn't find it even though the tracking shows it was delivered. Several back and forth and because it was over thanksgiving that slowed things down. Basically they didn't take ownership of it. I asked for some sort of compensation since I was out money and had to quickly reorder the items again so it'd arrive in time. When I got there the resort manager who I was dealing with the whole time kinda brushed it me off. Maybe shes used to dealing with tourists from another country? I'm not sure but basically i needed to spend even more time dealing with this so they can start an insurance claim...really? just deal with the facts you have. I'm still dealing with this after i've come back as I did not want to spend another minute on it.Other then that, the elevators were troublesome. As I said we were on the 5th floor so we could just take the stairs down. Some ladies were complaining that they waited 30 minutes...not sure where they got from complaining to the front desk.Pool boys were cool with the towels and the pool itself was great, the kids didn't want to leave. We'll probably be back again in 2 years however we are looking elsewhere as this is the 2nd time there has been a problem at HHV. I'm not sure if its due to management and the lack of training but given the price they charge, it should be pretty damn good. Oh yeah the bell boys were awesome. Parking is expensive but honestly its Waikiki, way more convenient having a car. Only ate at blue water shrimp on site otherwise it was foodland and take out.Laundry was convenient..used it every other day. The dishwashers are horrible and we used it mainly as a drying rack..the place is getting dated, hope they have plans to refurbish.","Vancouver, Canada","johnny f</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",22,3.0

The front desk staff were so good! You check in at the Grand Waikikiian. They got for us a really nice one bedroom high up on the 22nd floor facing the sunset and Magic Island.It was so nice - we spent quite a bit of time on the balcony since the sun was only on there from 4-6 pm. Looking at the floor plan, there are not very many rooms per floor and 24 floors. In fact, there is only one 1 bedroom facing west on each floor so we were indeed fortunate. Another reason was that there had been some major electrical issues going on so there was a generator going 24x7 on the east side - would have hated that noise. Also, the east side of the tower overlooks the big green lawn area - where they often have weddings and convention events. We had the Dentist ADA convention going on.What we like about the entire Hilton Hawaiian Village area is the location at the end of Waikiki at one end and close to the Ala Moana Mall and Magic Island the other direction. Perfect for getting around walking. No need for a car here - and you can also take The Bus - which is great and easy to do!The room itself was quite nice and fully furnished. Extremely quiet as well which was good since lots of families with babies and strollers here - but we didn't hear them. And everyone at HGVC was so so friendly and helpful. Not used to that! We also liked the ability to go to all the different pools (only the Alii Tower is not available). We enjoyed the fun pool at the Lagoon tower with the slides and then for a change of pace, went to the Kalia Tower pool on the 4th floor - very quiet and peaceful. The Tapas pool the time we were there was basically a kids day care center so we didn't go there. There are so many different places to eat and explore right within the village too. Nice ABC store and 2 Starbucks, along with many eateries. Hilton does a great job with this Village - and we especially enjoyed the Lagoon Tower.

It made my holiday so much better as I was there solo (I planned on bringing someone however it didn’t end up that way) and is located in a safe, secure and friendly environment. The hotel staff are amazing and show an enormous duty of care I say this from my personal experience.Having come from the Australian winter, I ended up with heat stroke. Within that time I was advised there was a Doctor on site as well as other services which were great to know were on site.The location is perfectly situation on the most beautiful beach i’ve ever seen. In addition to this there are so many shops on site you literally could get anything you needed without leaving.I personally recommend this hotel to all Australians who are making there first trip over to Hawaii. The amenities are vast, you can keep in contact with the hotel through the mobile app and they always make sure you receive the best care.When I arrived I was early. I was in a very spacious Diamond Head room with an amazing view. In saying that, I asked if I could upgrade and paid the difference and stayed in a corner room in the luxurious Rainbow tower.There is also a dedicated area where you can organise your day trips. I organised Pearl Harbour tour this way and it was the most amazing experience and is a must do for anyone who goes to Oahu.The entire area is beautiful, given the time difference with Australia it took me a while to kick the jet lag but I highly recommend a stroll on Ala Moana Boulevard, the area is just so amazingly clean and breathtaking with Diamond Head always in view.I also cant recommend enough the Tropical Bar and Grill! The service is spectacular and is the food and drink. It is one of my favourite bar i’ve been too. In addition to this, there is an IHOP on Ala Moana Boulevard and if your Australia you have to check it out you wont regret it.This is seriously the only review I could literally list 100’s of positive point and it would never end. All I can say is I highly recommend it for everyone and if you can spare that little bit extra you really need to stay in the Rainbow Tower.I personally stayed 7 nights and this trip was spectacular. This trip will always be close to my heart and the next time I return to Hawaii I will certainly stay at this resort again.Make sure to put on sunscreen and were a hat as although its beautiful weather its very humid and given most Australians are of European decent like myself you will find yourself burnt very quick. It was the only mistake I made on my holiday.Again I want to thank Hilton Hawaiian Village for such a great stay. I am recommending you to all those I know heading your way.I also want to finally add that Waikiki Trolley was a fantastic experience. If you go and you aren't driving I highly recommend getting a pass. The staff are well educated and will remind you of famous places your passing that you didn't even realise.",,MelbourneAus85,22,5.0

Here is a summary.Hokulani Waikiki – Only club outside the Hilton Hawaiian Village (HHV) cluster, closer to the heart of Waikiki, with more restaurant and shopping options. A 5 minute walk to the beach. Nice rooftop pool area.The remaining four clubs, sorted by newness, are located in the HHV cluster, sharing common pools, the lagoon, parking, facilities, and a two to four minute walk to the beach. Self contained resort, a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Center (west) and the heart of Waikiki (east). Grand Islander – Newest addition (2017), one of the furthest from the lagoon and main pools, some street noise being directly on Kalia, but a couple minutes closer to Waikiki.Grand Waikikian (2006) – Largest rooms, still looks and feels newish. More details below.Kalia Suites (2001)- Mostly hotel rooms, furthest from the lagoon and main pools, some street noise being directly on the main intersection, mostly city views, ocean views are obstructed by the other towers. This usually has the greatest availability.Lagoon Tower (1950s) – Oldest and closest to the beach and lagoon. Higher floors have unobstructed views.Now onto my most recent stay at the Grand Waikikian. Stayed at a two-bed premier room, high floor with ocean view, in the mountainside tower (versus the ocean tower). 1200+ square feet, huge master bedroom and bath with Jacuzzi tub, but a bit undersized living/dining/kitchen area. Can accommodate six, comfortable for sleeping with two per each of the two rooms and two in the living room, but living room could feel slightly cramped during waking hours. Here is the website’s write-up. “This spacious two-bedroom, two-bathroom ocean view suite with balcony features a master bedroom with a king bed and bathroom with a free-standing shower and separate soaking tub. The second bedroom is furnished with a king bed or two double beds and bathroom with a shower only. The suite includes a generous living room with separate dining area, cable TV, PlayStation 3, and queen-size sleeper sofa, as well as a full kitchen with rice steamer and washer/dryer.”Spacious lobby, plentiful bi-lingual (Japanese-English) registration and concierge desk staff. As noted in the hotel’s room write-up, the unit was well equipped with everything you would need to make and enjoy a dinner and night in.I would definitely stay at the Grand Waikikian again if I wanted to spend more time within the unit, at the Hokulani if spending more time outside in the heart of Waikiki, or the Lagoon Tower if going to and from the lagoon or beach.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Grant K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",170,4.0

We were trying to get ready for a wedding and could not believe how many people it took to assess the flooded situation. By far one of the worse stays.

During peak times it takes forever for you to get on the elevator since everyone is trying to go to every floor. If you are in the penthouse level, it will take you forever to get on since everyone from the lower level is riding the elevator up and then going down causing the elevator to be full before it gets to your floor.

We loved our 1BR suite in the Lagoon Tower and made use of the full size fridge, the utensils and plates, though we didn't make any food beyond a few bows of cereal, and some fruit. I would say that Hilton has a lot to offer guests of all types. If you want to shop at upscale stores, there are plenty here in the outdoor mall area between towers - not our scene, but fun to stroll through once or twice. If you need your Starbucks in the morning, you have 2 on the property. Even the cheaper ABC beach shops are located on the property and also just on the street side of the property. We ate meals on and off the resort. We really enjoyed the Tropics Bar and Grill for lunch and dinner (great food and location) -- in a different tower on the property, but everything's close. For families with younger kids, in addition to the multiple pools on resort, you have their great shallow sand-bottomed lagoon with small fish swimming around and no waves or current to worry about. The pool at the Lagoon Tower is probably the best on the entire property with water slides, hot tubs, and other fun features. Finally, the beach at this resort is probably the largest and safest in the area. The staff all around are excellent!My main reason for not 100% recommending this resort is that there are so many costs associated with staying here. Over $50 per day for use of an umbrella and 2 loungers at the beach? What is the resort fee for, if not to offset some of these costs. Then the audacity to charge $50 for valet parking (vs. $43 for self park) and it doesn't include PROPER valet service where I can call down from my room and have car ready when I get down. I was told this is because too may people don't come get their car. I'm sure it's a headache for all hotels, but it's a minor annoyance if you are charging this much. Buffet breakfasts were about $10 overpriced. Maybe a couple of free vouchers would have been nice, or kids eat free at the buffet, if you're going to charge the adults $30 each.Also, there is live music at the resort, so sometimes at night it is a bit loud around kid bedtime hours.Overall this is a wonderful location and a great resort, but when people are paying a premium, and are likely going to keep spending on the property (there's conveniently not much else around within a short stroll to eat, drink, etc) maybe don't so blatantly gouge us at every turn","Toronto, Canada","TOgeek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",18,4.0

The public can access which drove us insane as we couldn't find chairs at times. How's that fair that anyone can use the pools when we pay resort fees etc... to use the facilities. There's has to be something done about it. I wouldn't care if there was a gate erected to keep the public away.

We apparently did not do enough research. We are HGVC owners in New York but thought it would be fun and interesting to try a different place in a Paradise resort. The Hilton Vacation Club is huge and situated on 22 acres, right on Waikiki beach. There are three Time Share towers and I believe five hotels under the Hilton Brand, so one can imagine how many people are on site. We did make a point of stopping each day at Lappert's ice cream as well as Honolulu cookie. There are two ABC stores on site where one can basically get anything one needs, as well as a Safeway less than five minutes away drive. There are multiple restaurants and cafes on site as well. We stayed in the Grand Islander tower which was lovely. The front desk staff, bellman and valet were delightful, friendly and helpful. Despite asking four different concierges for help, we found them much less helpful. We were on the 18th floor in a two bedroom and two bath suite. The kitchen and living room were well appointed and had everything we needed. There is also a washer/dryer. The views of the beach were lovely and we also looked out over a park. There was a nice balcony to sit out on. I am not certain I would want to stay much higher up as it is a busy hotel and sometimes there were a lot of stops on the elevator to get to the higher floors. This tower also houses the bus terminal for all of the resort. Our tower had a lovely lap pool and hot tub but it was not an adult pool so virtually impossible to do laps as kids were constantly jumping in on my head. It was the same with the hot tub. While there are multiple other pools, the beach and a lagoon, again there were always too many kids in the pools and hot tubs. There were times that we could not find a place to sit as all the lounge chairs were taken. In addition, one has to pay to rent a chaise or cabana on the beach. There are multiple activities that one can do but again one pays extra. There were beautiful fireworks on Friday evening over the lagoon.There is self parking on site which cost $43/night. As we traveled all over the island, we did use a car a lot but if one doesn't want to go too far, I am not certain one necessarily needs a car. So, I think this place would be great for families as there is so much to do for them. It is close to the Ala Moana and Beachwalk shopping areas so great location for shoppers. Also, if one wants to be in Waikiki, this property is right in the smack middle. It is easy to walk anywhere, either on the beach boardwalk or the street. Lots of shopping close by. I would not recommend this property for anyone that wants a quieter or more laid back experience.

Within a day or two, the valet remembered who we were and a year later, when we returned, remembered us. Housekeeping does a GREAT job on your room, and are ever so pleasant when you see them. Front desk staff are very nice. They can run a little slow, but it's because they want each and every person to feel they are VIP. Unlike a lot of vacation clubs, this staff does not push you into having to talk with the HGVC people, they don't call your room every day trying to get you to come to a timeshare presentation. In fact, the ONLY time they have ever called us was when my husband had set up an appointment, then forgot and didn't go, They called and I told them we were no longer interested and they were very polite and they didn't bother us the rest of the trip. There is several ABC Stores within walking distance and they carry everything! There are places to eat and other shopping places within walking distance, you don't even have to leave the Hawaiian Village.

The studio is basically a regular hotel room with a microwave, small compact fridge and some plates and utensils in the room. There floors dedicated to HGV and floors dedicated to the the Hilton Hawaiian Village and you can definitely tell the difference between the two as we have stayed on both floors. HGV floors are definitely more upgraded and have free washers and dryers on each floor (none in the units). Had a great view of the beach, lagoon and the fireworks from the unit. Was able to watch unlimited amounts of movies from the rental machines in the lobby. PROS: Nice room for the amount paying through the HGV cash price stay vs other hotels in Waikiki. There is a Starbucks downstairs (which is always busy in the morning). Private pool on the 4th floor for guests only. Easy access to the parking garage (walk past the ballroom and it takes you to the elevators of the parking garage). CONS: If you don't arrive before a certain time (6 pm?) you will have to check in at the Grand Waikikian --- which is the next buidling past the parking garage. We arrived just before the desk was going to close and was able to check in at the Kalia desk for our keys. There is usually only one person working at the desk (or at least during the times we checked -in and out) so it made for a longer wait.

We were aware of it ahead of time and planned for it, however it just seems like a new type of scam for hotels. $35 for Fitness Center, Water and Internet access. Not horrible, but a significant amount of traffic noise even on the 10th floor. If you are sensitive to this, go higher. Crazy elevator controls seemed to confuse everyone. No buttons in the elevators at all , you programmed your floor in the lobby and hoped to remember what number elevator to step into. On the flip site, it is efficient and we never waited long for a elevator. Not a single cab or Uber drive knew which tower to return us too as it is very new. The Bad: Concierge was useless, especially for a vacation center like this.

Elevator: We’ve read about the slow elevator but we were underestimated how SLOW it was. On a Thursday morning around 10am, we waited over 15mins to get down to the lobby from the 11th floor. On Saturday morning, we had to wait again when we wanted to go down to the lobby around the same time. The only way for us to get down was first we had to go up. Then of course, it had to stop at every single floor on the way down. We heard from the people on the 20th floor they waited for about 30mins. This was absolutely ridiculous. Check-in/Concierge/Customer Service: Upon check-in, a booklet with our room keys were handed but there was no mentioned of what’s in the booklet or where we can get a hotel map, activities calendar, etc. The staff we encountered (concierge desks, customer service, towel stations) did not seem friendly (no smiles) at all except for housekeeping. To be fair, we just spent 4 days at Aulani before taking the kids to spend some time in Waikiki so we did have some high expectations coming from such a happy and friendly resort. Pools: the water was too cold. The “hot tub” was too small and too crowded. We barely spent any time at the pools because of this. Towels: one towel person. You have to return the soiled towel to get a new one. This policy makes it tough when we have the little ones. Water bottles: for each night you stay, a coupon for 2 complimentary water bottles was given at check in. (We were not told how these coupons work at check-in). Well, to get your water, you have to take the coupon to the unfriendly concierge who are sitting right across from elevator. They then unhappily asking for your room number and confirm your name before giving you the water bottles. It was so unnecessary. Why are they inconvenient us for these water bottles? Why can this be part of housekeeping? Then it just clicked with us when they started talking about the “welcome packet” and timeshare opportunity. Aha!!! What a mediocre way of pitching!Kids Club: nothing for kids under 5 except ukulele lesson. We tried to sign up after 20 minutes of different people misinformed us where to sign up. Then we were told it’s full and that we should have signed up the day before. What a joke! And if you’re expected to see bath robes and slippers in your room, don’t. We’ll not return to this hotel the next time we visit Waikiki. If you have young children, for the price difference which is not much if you factor in the gear/chair rentals, stay at Aulani. Kids club are awesome there; pools are huge and warmer with unlimited towels; floaties, life vests, boogie boards and sand toys are all free; no $75 charge for chairs and umbrella on the beach; great private lagoon; lots of activities throughout the resort on a daily basis; rooms, bathrooms are nice and clean; staff are friendly; I could go on and on...","Danville, California","cdnessca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Danville, California</strong>",11,2.0

I did research and this place seemed like it fit the idea. When I arrived, I am not sure what I was expecting, but this wasn’t it. Don’t get me wrong. It’s in a perfect location. It’s directly on the beach with plenty of beach front, but the hotel itself is somewhat dated. We stayed in the Tower because I stated I wanted full ocean view and the ability to see the fireworks from my balcony. The room had older carpet, the bathroom vanity was dinged and dented, there were areas that could have been cleaned a lot better than they were, the dresser looked like a few suitcases had hit it and my full ocean view was more of a side/full view. The “super” pool is not that big and if you choose to sit on the beach, be prepared to rent chairs and an umbrella because they are not provided for guests. It’s a $36 charge for two chairs for the day. It has a great shopping area, nice dining and options so that you never need to leave the property if you choose so, that was nice. I heard some of the other buildings were newer and more luxurious, but I did not view them so I’m unable to comment on those. After we left this hotel, we flew to Maui and stayed at The Grand Wailea. That place is what I was expecting from this place. Big difference! So, all in all, it was an average hotel in a great location.

This resort is wonderful, you can just hang around here for a few days to explore. But you won't do that, Honolulu is just so much more to see and many more places to eat. The atmosphere here is great like Disneyland. Oh, if you don't like kids running around and want a quiet honeymoon hotel, this is not it. It is noisy around the kids pool which I do enjoy that happy family fun atmosphere. There are lots of people around because it is a huge Hilton resort. The Friday night firework around the lagoon area is another enjoyable event that you can see the fireworks so closed by and do not need to fight people . If you don't need the car badly Bus and taxi are very handy . Daily Parking is expensive $30 per day and hourly parking in town is expensive and not easy to find parking . We walk and use bus and taxi. Bus stop very close to the hotel. MacDonald and ABC Stores are with 10 minute walk , 15-20 minute walk to Waikiki and famous Ala Moana Shopping Mall. Honolulu is such a lovely city walking is safe and enjoyable. Avoid walking at night time at some quiet roads may not be safe because some homeless people may scare you. I like the Hilton resort.

Totally loved this property as Hilton Vacation Time Share owner.Booked this on short notice, less than 2 months prior to trip was able to get a small but efficient room at The Lagoon Tower. Can't be too picky as rooms among the whole HHV (Hilton Hawaiian Village) 8 towers get snapped up quickly.Our first 5 nights at the Lagoon Tower was great. Room not as big as suites. No balcony and lower floor. Not a big deal as we did not spend a lot of time in the room. Bed is big queen, comfy. Small kitchenette has sink, microwave, toaster, coffee machine, all kitchenware, utensils. Strong AC. Only drawback (negative) is bathtub fit a small person under 4 feet. If you were to sit in the tub as a grown up, it is impossible. Treat taking stand up shower in this as if you were on a cruise ship. They do have a clothes line you can pull out to hang dry clothes, so that's nice.As for access to amenities like the lagoon in front on the beach it's just a stone throw away, fantastic.Then we got upgraded to the Grand Wakikian for 3 nights. What an upgrade! It's a suite, compared to our Lagoon room, this felt like a palace. Separate living room with sofas, TV, full sized kitchen, big bedroom with a 2 person bathtub. Bathroom has a good sized shower stall. And balcony facing Ala Moana Blvd. And a washer and dryer--what a surprise. Again, location is superb as far as accessing all the amenities HHV has to offer: restaurants, many ABC convenient stores, shops, lagoon, beach etc etc. Walking on the 2 miles stretch of Waikiki is not a problem for us. Beautiful sunrise, sunset etc.Both rooms we have were quiet, free WiFi was great.Service from Hilton from start to finish and in between was PAR EXCELLENCE! From valet to check in staff. Housekeeping (remember this is timeshare so only every so often they clean the time share room which is fine for us). Everyone has big smile and cheerful to help.It's one of the best Hilton Vacations as a timeshare owner.","New Orleans, Louisiana","jenesairie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Orleans, Louisiana</strong>",313,5.0

Also, I was given inaccurate information on several occasions, always to the benefit of my hosts. Starting with the room, it appeared generally clean, except in the bathroom, where you REALLY want clean. Instead, the door was filthy with hundreds of fingerprints and there was buildup accruing in the caulk. Worse still, there was a buildup on the bidet wand that I didn't notice until AFTER first use. I am STILL concerned about the consequences of that. On the service end when adding this stay at Laguna Tower to the beginning of a previously booked stay at another tower, I was inaccurately told I might be able to hold the room until the next room (same HGVCresort complex) became available. After arrival, they wouldn't even consider it. When deciding on valet or self parking, I specifically asked if I could call to have my car brought up. The answer was ""yes"" ... until I was on the hook for valet parking. ($47 daily).That leads to the next innacuracy. They gave us distorted maps that make it look much more difficult to get to off resort (affordable) dining and entertainment options than reality. Use google. The worst inaccuracies of all were conveyed by the concierge staff, who it turns out are part of the Sales team. They claim to offer discounts on services and experiences, almost all of which are offered for less from the merchants. After surrendering my car due to parking costs, they steered me away from the trolley shuttle to their partner cab company, wildly inaccurately forecasting the cost. And they persuaded to take their discounted luau in exchange for a ""60 minute, no pressure"" sales presentation"" (ok, my fault for believing that one) that almost interminable alternative offers each time you decline. If you do this and you're not buying, count on 3 hours. Bottom line is that the location and views are very nice.

It has direct access to a really lovely swimming beach and also one sand bottom pool you can rent kayaks and peddle boats. Really unique and fun. It's also cool that there is some wild life like fish ponds and parrots through the complex. Also a huge selection of restaurants and shops.

Many times when we use the elevator we were packed like sardines. We were on the 20th floor and we would have to ride the elevator packed and stop at several floors. That was kind of a headache.

It has been nicely updated since the last time I stayed here over 5 years ago. We've stayed at the Kalia Tower and also the Grand Waikikian, but like the Lagoon Tower based on its proximity to the lagoon and ocean. I stayed here most recently with my fiancee and her parents in a 2-bedroom ocean view unit and it was amazing.As mentioned, the units have been updated and ours looked fresh, clean and tidy. Our unit had a king bed in the main bedroom and two full beds in the 2nd. The king bed in the main unit was very comfortable. The living room and kitchen area were spacious and the balcony looking out to the lagoon and ocean was a favorite for my fiancee's parents. We would have breakfast and coffee on the balcony in the morning and sometimes eat lunch or snacks out there as well. While the hotel was busy, we didn't hear any of our neighbors and always had a peaceful nights sleep. There is a full kitchen with fridge, stovetop, oven and microwave. This definitely helps you save on eating out all the time. The kitchen has also been nicely updated and fully functional with all of the utensils and cookware you need.The check-in process was quick, easy and the staff are very nice and friendly. The front desk no longer gives out leis, but when I told them it was my fiancee's parents first time to Hawaii, he went out of his way to track down the kukui nut leis just for them. Great customer service! We received great service from the bellmen, concierge and housekeeping as well. They were quick to deliver anything that we ran out of in the room and were always courteous. The Lagoon Tower is very close to the lagoon (thus the name) and the beach. We like this location because it's a short walk to Kalakaua which is the main stretch of Waikiki. Being a short walk away means it's not in a crazy busy area, yet it is close enough to walk out to the many restaurants and shops. The minor drawback is that laundry is located in a shared area and not in the room itself like in some of the other HGVC properties. It was never a problem for us though as every time we went to use the washer / dryer, they were readily available.We loved staying at the Lagoon Tower and can't wait to come back again!","Campbell, California","kystone25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Campbell, California</strong>",12,5.0

Where do I start? Airport arrival: Took Charley's Taxi from the airport to the hotel. Called them once we arrived at the airport-- they came 5 mins later. Only $29 flat rate for my family of 5. No one can beat that price! Also used them going back to the airport, they already had taxi's lined up, so we didn't need to call. Hotel arrival: We saw long lines once we arrived, but thanks to being a timeshare member, we walked right up and was able to check in. (Lagoon Tower is for timeshare members, but you check in at the Grand Waikikian). Bell men where right there to assist with bags. I did not receive a lei upon arrival, but the resort was so breathe taking-- I didn't care! (Well maybe a little). Hotel room: We received a 2 bedroom suite, with 2 balconies, full kitchen, with bar and stools, full dining table, 2 bathrooms, and a wonderful view of the pool area. Grounds: Everything was perfectly manicured to make you feel like you are in paradise! Some colors of the flowers or on the birds were some I have never seen before. Plenty of picture perfect opportunities. Ponds, waterfalls, clean beach and pool area-- grounds are well kept. Water activities: Pools, pools, everywhere! And a beautiful lagoon for activities for a fee. The beach was absolutely stunning! All of the water is in walking distance, and close to each other. Food: There are so many restaurants, grab and go, and bars available. Believe or not, I chose to stay in my food comfort zone. I did Benihana, Ihop, Starbucks, and Buffalo Wild Wings. (Yeah, I know). Shopping: Lots of stores within walking distance. Souvenirs, crafts, etc... all await you once crossing the street. Exploring: I was able to book a Luau, Pearl harbor, and other activities all at the desk in the hotel. The price was the very same if I would have booked online. Conclusion: The staff is friendly with warm smiles, the grounds are well kept, food and drink are at not a shortage, and the weather is near perfect. We flew 11 hours and had to adjust to a 6 hour time difference. I'd do it all again for this property. We will be back!

How we almost got a free upgrade to a 2 bedroom condo. 2. Once you've stayed at a Hilton Grand Vacation timeshare, you can't go back to the standard Hilton hotel rooms anymore. 3. Hilton Hawaiian Village is a complex of 9 towers in Waikiki.  3,000+ Hilton hotel rooms and 1,000+ HGV timeshare condos.  4. February 2016, I stayed in the Kalia tower in a regular 12' x 24' room.   HHV towers with standard hotel rooms include the Alii, Rainbow towers, Diamond Head towers, Tapa Towers, and the regular rooms in the Kalia tower.  5. I purchased a Waikiki Hilton timeshare for $37K, with $4k worth of annual timeshare usage.  Must use the $15k in bonus timeshare money to stay at Hilton and RCI timeshares for the next two years.   6. We arrived at 230pm, and checked in at the main lobby.  Hundreds of guest in line.  I ask where to check in for the HGV Lagoon tower.  Lady says this is the line for the hotel guests.  Lady directs me to walk to the Grand Wakikian.  7. In the Hilton Hawaiian Village, three of the eight towers are HGV buildings: the Kalia suites, the Grand Wakikian, and the Lagoon Tower, and they have their own separate checkin.  8. We walk the 100 yards to the Grand Waikikian.  No line here for HGV guests!  Registration says we were checked into a two bedroom HGV unit for one week.  My wife said she thought we had a one bedroom unit.  9. Room not ready, so we took a 10 minute walk to Food Pantry on 438 Hoborn Lane to pick up groceries, avoiding the overpriced ABC and Whalers General Stores in HHV.10. At 330pm HHV texts that our room ready.  No, not a two bedroom unit, but thanks to the wife, who doesn't know when to keep her mouth shut, a one bedroom unit, room 361, on the third of 26 floors in the Lagoon tower.11. Room right across from elevator, almost triple the size of the HHV hotel rooms.  700+ sq ft, with full kitchen, living room, dining area,  bedroom with king bed and bathroom.  Two flat screen TVs, including a 60"" TV in the living room.12. Granite counter top in kitchen and bathroom sink area.13. No sheets by themselves on the bed, but sheet wrapped comforter, so we can't kick off the comforter alone, with only a sheet on top when sleeping in the buff.14. Electrical outlet closest to dining table not functioning.  Refrigerator did not keep food cold enough, at the coldest temperature setting.   Milk spoiled after 5 days.15. Pull out bed sofa in the living room, but not to sleep on unless you want to wreck your back. 16. Saw 5 minutes of fireworks from the balcony on Friday at 745pm.17. Wife would have preferred a bath tub instead of a shower.  I asked the housekeeper and they said most of the rooms in the Lagoon tower have showers, not baths, due to guests bringing in sand from beach.   18. Free communal laundry room on each floor.19. Not a great view on the lanai, with the lagoon in the background.  However it has it's advantages.  Great for people viewing, especially looking down on young women in bikinis walking below! 20. Better than viewing the busy street access to the Marina on the east side.21. Easy to get up or down the stairs to the lobby when the slow elevators to all 27 floors packed.22. The third floor lanai is shielded by the Rainbow Tower 100 yards away, from the  tropical sun that makes most of the higher floor lanais too hot to use during the day.  23. We had a ring side view of a Hawaiian dance show as part of a private buffet on the Great Lawn between the buildings.  Night time serenaded by the Hilton Luau on top of the parking garage next door!  24. Free AC, wifi, and unlike the Hilton hotel rooms, no resort fees, and no 24%  state hotel tax.  $35 parking per day for both hotel guests and HGV guests, so don't bring a car. 25. Every tower has their own pool, and there is a main pool with slides, for hotel and HGV guests only.  Good enforcement preventing guests trying to save unoccupied pool chaises when not in the pool area.   26. Avoid all the overpriced restaurants on the premises, and eat fast food take out from Food Pantry, or eat nearby at Wailana Coffee Shop, Goofys, Steak Shack, Waikiki Cheeseburger, or Grand Harue, all within a 10 minute walk from our room.27.

Yes, Hawaii! This has always been on my bucket list of trips. Never did I ever think I would go to Hawaii but there I was. We stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach on the island of Oahu so don't let the name fool you. The resort? Amazing! The service? Amazing! The food? Amazing! I could not have been more pleased with this vacation. The amenities on site include pizza, pasta, sandwiches, ice cream and my favourite...Starbucks! Two of them to be exact. If all of that was not enough, the shopping is ridiculously great. My favourite store? Louis Vuitton, yes there is a Louis Vuitton on site. On top of everything else, the fireworks are the cherry on top of the sundaes (yes sundaes...plural) that we indulged in almost every night. Our room was immaculate, two bedrooms plus the pull-out sofa, a full kitchen with fridge, stove, microwave and coffee maker. The lagoon was like having your own personal beach, the kids enjoyed paddle boarding, water trikes and kayaks, as well as the basic swimming. The pools were clean and although two of the water slides were closed, the kids enjoyed riding the same ones over and over again. The staff were great, very personable and always willing to help. As for the surroundings, there was no shortage of places to be and things to see. The mall is a short 10 minute walk and there are multiple restaurants surrounding the hotel grounds. Being from Canada, the kids were keen to attend IHOP everyday and the Buffalo Wild Wings was not far at all. The McDonalds was always on the kids list, although we never made it (I want to so this was an accident but Mama Bear, is not keen on McDonalds). Overall, everyone was very pleased and we would take any opportunity to go again.","Durham, Canada","heatherpenni</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durham, Canada</strong>",27,5.0

HHV is an extremely busy property year round. We choose to stay at the Lagoon Tower because of the size of the rooms, the location of the building, and the ease of getting into and out of Waikiki. It's not smack dab in the middle of what everyone imagines Waikiki to be, but that's what we like. The Lagoon Tower is a converted condo so the room sizes are comfortable, as opposed to the more recently constructed Grand Waikikian, where the rooms are more hotel sized. We always stay in a 2-bedroom ocean front because those are the nicest rooms. These rooms were recently refurbished. Carpets are not as drabby and worn and the furniture is new. Kitchen appliances seem to have remained the same, though. The chairs in the living room are a joke. It's quite possible the designer never sat in the chair. It is downright uncomfortable. There's two of them, so really the only seating options are the couch and the patio furniture.Lagoon still has an elevator problem where you have to make sure you allot enough time to catch an elevator during peak times. They are fast cars so once you get on it's not so bad. Guests seem to have learned to queue better except for the occasional rude head of the family that thinks they are more important than everyone else waiting for the elevator.Aside from that, if you want to stay in the middle of Honolulu with a larger family, hands-down, this is the place to be aside from a vacation rental home. Despite the negatives at this location, it's still our preferred hotel while in town.",,JKinLAS,13,4.0

Down the hall there was a laundry room where we could wash and dry our clothes. Guests that stayed in the lagoon tower were always saying hello to one another. Staff were always kind and helpful.

When, entering your room, literally the only thing one sees is lanais across at the Ilikai Hotel next door? When not even the first glimpse of water can be seen before two-thirds of the way into the room, and not much more until almost at the lanai doors? Who would call that an ocean view? As I found out when I complained, HGVC does. And no rooms with any more of an ocean-view room were available . . . leaving me stuck with my Ilikai view for the duration of my stay and having to keep at least the sheer draperies closed the whole time to even imagine the ocean was out there.The Lagoon Tower accommodation was comfortable enough and fully equipped, but awfully plain, with clunky furniture more suited to an institution. Also, other guests could be easily heard through the connecting door between our rooms. Still, the Hawaiian Village location, with its expansive ocean and lagoon frontage, wide beaches, lush landscaping, abundant on-site dining and shopping, and proximity to other attractions, including Ala Moana Park and the shopping center, is unbeatable in Waikiki.

The property is immense, and it was nice to have shopping and small restaurants on the property that accepted room charge payments (but were not necessarily part of the hotel's restaurant choices). For example, you can eat in/take out at Round Table Pizza, CJ's Deli, Fresco Italian restaurant, and Blue Water Crab. There is easy quick access to the beach (crowded but nice), the Atlantis submarine tour company is right on site, service at the restaurants was very good and friendly. The pool was very nice, w/ several water slides. 2 were not operational when we were there, but the one that was involved a dark tunnel - very speedy and fun! My 5 year old son had a blast with that water slide. You have access to free DVD rentals of new releases (DVD Now). That is a nice thing for families. Stayed at the Lagoon Tower, one of several tower residences at the HHV. We had a 1 bedroom suite with a full kitchen (full size refrigerator and 4 burner electric stove, full size microwave, dishwasher, utensils and plates - wonderful for families). The other really great thing is the free use of laundry & drying machines on most if not all the floors of the Lagoon Tower. This was invaluable as we had been vacationing for 1 week at other resorts in other parts of Hawaii, and being able to do laundry conveniently and for free is AMAZING (any family with small children will definitely agree). There is a Play station 3 in the living room, attached to a 50+ inch size flat screen TV. Self parking is available for $32/day. It was convenient. One complaint - no recycling on the property. That may not bother some people, but it did bother me. There was so much in terms of water bottles, cans, glass bottles, paper, etc that were just thrown into the trash. Very strange especially for being in Hawaii (the Target in Maui for example does not provide any plastic bags to customers at check out).

The sofa is a pullout bed but we never used.okay now on to my main complaint..it's the noise. we couldn't get away from it. the lounge plays music till 1030-11pm and it carries all the way over. slightly annoying but whatever. my sister and brother rin law took the other bathroom and thr delivery trucks and the little sand grooming carts would wake them up at 530-6am everyday. would a higher floor solve that? maybe..so I regret not going to themanager about the noise.we used the pool once and it was cold..we preferred to go to the beach itself and it sucked not having a shower or foot rinse thing besides at he pool area..hassle to go there with kids and ur beach crap.laundry was convenient we ran several loads but ran into the problem of people leaving their laundry in the machines and not taking them out..house keeping can't touch t so you have to call for a manager to move it and bag it up. housekeeping was great since we were using a timeshare they cleaned it once for us and they were great about providing anything else you needed by calling or texting.the location is good and bad...the good it's way easier to drive here then our usual destination at the wyndham beachwalk. the bad is that it's damn far away from everything 15 mins walk to ala moana or 20 min walk to kapahulu or Kuhio. my feet were killing me by the end of our trip.during checkout the power went out..lol I seriously have the weirdest moments ago the front desk area..always an adventure! that being said..our family enjoyed the hotel and my kids would have enjoyed it more if they were older..PS: food on site is a marked up eg. blue ocean shrimp is $18 vs 15 at the mall..we would drive to get food like at me bbq, poke from foodland or udon from marakume, also a food pantry on Hobron.","Vancouver, Canada","johnny f</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",22,4.0

The way I understand it,the first 12 floors are hotel units and the upper floors are the timeshare units. Our stay on the 16th floor was ocean front and was very nice. I'd guess the unit size was approx 1000 sq ft with typical HGVC features. I guess each resort in the complex has its positives and maybe negatives. One thing that we liked about Kalia was it was closest to the entrance of the Hawaiian village and thus quieter,without the crowd of pedestrians about the area.(Also,you can check in at the Kalia bldg if staying there)There is a Starbucks at the lobby level. Observations:the beach will be the longest distance to travel amongst the buildings. The Kalia pool appears to be smaller than the other resorts/buildings. Incidentally,none of the pools throughout the complex are heated... and they are cold until ya get use to them. Only things I could say that could be an improvement are: The AC fan speeds on high provides minimal circulation. Ceiling fans in the bedroom and living room would be helpful. At times,It felt like a hot 68 degrees.Parking: Parking is not cheap at 32 bucks a day. 39 for valet.Pay the extra bucks for parking,as getting to your car isnt the easiest and... when the resort is crowded or conferences on site... you can drive around a bit before finding a space- Pay the extra 50 bucks(as nothing is cheap in Hawaii).Should I rent a car? YES. If you really want to see the island,just booking tours isnt going to do it... Getting out of Waikiki will allow you to drive to the more natural,scenic areas. Traffic won't be alot of fun but things will quiet down once you get off the ""H"" highways and cruise along the coast around the island. Restaurants: there are plenty of choices within the area. Some at the village can get quite pricy,which I guess is ok if you are rich like I'm not(30 dollar breakfasts come to mind). Another good reason to rent that car. Also,a drive to the nearby Walmart worked for us for getting coffee and mornin stuff. Other good choices within 1 mile or less walking distances(see those reviews) and plenty of choices by car and cheaper.Lastly: all the staff was very nice and helpful at our Kalia Tower stay.","Hernando, Florida","urple2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hernando, Florida</strong>",64,4.0

There are a few pools, shopping, although it is more high end, coffee/ice cream shop, ABC stores which has just about everything and reasonably priced.

I love Hilton Hawaiian village and have stayed here about 10 times so far - always in the rainbow tower: this time the hotel was sold out and had to get a room in the timeshare tower - Lagoon. I do not like staying at a timeshare in Hilton compared to the hotel - as a diamond member the benefits are terrible. In the hotel you get all the benefits of being diamond including room upgrades, late checkout and food vouchers for you and a guest each day of your stay (they used to have a lounge but no more). When you stay in the timeshare section you get two bottles of water during your stay and 2,000 Hilton points - that is it! Really no benefit at all which is frustrating. Plus checkout is firm at 10 AM. The timeshare rooms are bigger and have a kitchen which can be useful for some families (I have never cooked on vacation - well, don't cook at home either so I guess I never need one :). Bathroom was outdated. Balcony was nice. Hallway loud with doors slamming all night (that can happen anywhere). Views not as nice as rainbow tower.The Hilton village itself though is wonderful and I would not stay anywhere else on the island. Beautiful grounds and pools. The gym in the Tapa tower could use some updating. The resort fee is outrageous! Come on - 30 bucks plus tax for internet?! That is not unique to this hotel but is just a travesty in the hotel industry. Just add hat to the cost of the room and not call it a resort fee. (Personal pet peeve there).The timeshare sales pitch is relentless. Asked where the bathrooms are and got cornered into a 5 minute spiel. Although we ended up doing the presentation for some Hilton village dollars to spend during our stay. 90 minutes of our time was well worth it and it was pressure free. The beach is amazing. Last minor complaint is with the towel stands. The pools close at 7 yet the towel stand closes at 5 at some pools? It then directs you to another pool and towel stand which was also closed. This happened on two nights. Can't they keep the towel stands open till the pool closes? Overall though will definitely stay at the hotel part of the Village again. But if you end up at the timeshare it is nice as well!","Minneapolis, Minnesota","xiphoid76</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",298,3.0

Room was a 1 bdrm garden view third floor unit facing the pool. Issues: Noise :Due to the fact that we were on a low floor the noise from the pool area was extensive which could be expected however the noise from the pool was still quite loud with balcony doors closed. (very poor sound proofing) I have stayed in low floor units at the grand waikikian (newer tower) and the soundproofing is so much better. (hilton needs to improve soundproofing at next refurb of lagoon tower)Pool with slides: Pool is way overcrowded to the point the pool was shut down multiple times for cleaning. (I am not just talking about unavailable chairs which is also an issue but literally the pool itself and number of bathers) This pool has the only slides on property the majority of families flock to this pool which is grossly undersized. I also question how good of a job they do cleaning the pool based on the dirty towel that was at the bottom of the closed slide the duration of our trip. (see photo) When the new timeshare tower opens which has only a plan for a small quiet pool which won't attract families I can only imagine the crowds then. Another issue I have is that the slides close at 5 pm. When on Oahu I believe many vacationers do activities during the day and return to the resort around this time only to discover that the slides are closed on the most popular pool. (why? cost cutting?) I stayed at Disney aulani and the water slides were open to 9 pm.Pool Staff: I have stayed at a good number of family timeshare resorts (multiple Disney Vacation Club resorts and Marriott vacation club resorts) and the staff here had to be the most unprofessional I have ever experienced. The staff was constantly on their cellphones talking / texting / listening to music and not doing an adequate job of monitoring the slides and pools. adults and children were jumping and climbing on rocks into the pool / at closing of slides adults and children climbed over fences and went down slides / no staff in area (one caveat security officers when on scene did enforce rules) Food: Specifically Poolside Pronto Pickle / food was premade, over priced and disgusting. Again I have stayed at dvc resorts and marriots and understand the premium price paid for poolside food (convenience etc.) however both those hotel chains provide good edible food. (hilton should be ashamed)Positives: Staff Front Desk, bell services, bar staff, restaurant staff (besides pool staff) were all very friendly and accommodating.Rooms: Clean,comfortable and spacious (except for soundproofing) and a good home base for a family visiting Oahu. Location: I have stayed at both Disney Aulani and Marriott Koolina and although I favor those resorts over HHV they are far away from the locations I like to visit on the island (south and east sides) Also as part of my Oahu trips I love to explore the local cuisine and HHV being located in Honolulu provides an abundance of dining opportunities touristy and non touristy unlike Koolina Resort Area which lacks the variety that HHV'S location provides.With the pros and cons of this resort I think people need to be aware of the issues before booking a stay and make their on choice on whether or not to stay here. I just wish Hilton would listen to some of the issues I have addressed as well as countless others which would really improve the quality of this resort in relation to other big name timeshare resorts.","Quincy, Massachusetts","walken1974</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Quincy, Massachusetts</strong>",8,2.0

While I expected a nice stay at a nice resort, the magnitude of this resort and the surrounding area caught me completely by surprise. I'll try to sum it up here as best I can. As I always do, I'll start with the cons and finish with what I really liked.Note that this is the Grand Vacations portion of Hilton Hawaiian Village, not the hotel/resort. I was very happy to find this time share section separate from the hotel. The hotel towers offered mostly basic hotel rooms and mostly double beds. Here we got a one bedroom, with kitchen and separate living room, for just a bit more than standard rooms at the resort cost. In my mind, it's a no brainer to book with Grand Vacations when possible.I only really have one gripe about my stay, and that was my room assignment. While I looked up floorplans for the building (Lagoon tower) and was happy with what I saw, the room I got was actually a little different. I was given a smaller room than the standard 1 bedroom because of the stairwell next door, so the room configuration was different. Instead of the open floorplan with kitchen+peninsula overlooking the living room, our small kitchen with little counter space was in a space no bigger than an oversized closet. After returning and looking more into it, it appears that these rooms are the *68 rooms on floors above the 8th floor. My brother and his family, who also booked a 1 bedroom, got the nicer floorplan across the hall. At the end of the day it didn't matter all that much to us. Our oceanview room overlooked the pool (from a high floor, very little noise), the marina, and the ocean. We could watch planes take off and land from the airport, and even saw our cruise ship come in the morning of our cruise. It was a spectacular view overall!Other than that minor gripe, I don't have much else negative to say. The resort is massive! I knew that going in but didn't fully grasp the magnitude. Lots of restaurants, shops, and activities right there in the village. The lagoon had a number of water toys to rent, provided a safe/calm area for young kids to play, and was gorgeous to look at. There were a number of pools, however we only made it to the one next to the Lagoon tower, which was the best in my opinion. There really was a lot to see just walking around the resort, it was fun to just grab a drink from the bar and walk around checking everything out. Restaurants ranged from nice sit-down restaurants to quick carry-out type places. It was great being able to grab a pizza and take it back up to our room. The only activity we did was SUP, which was a lot of fun. Very expensive, but the Lagoon is a great place to learn and find your sea legs.The location is great, right there at one end of Waikiki beach. It is possible to walk the length of the beach, though there's one section in front of the Sheraton where you need to go up and walk along a sidewalk right at the edge of the ocean. We walked about half way down the 1.9 mile beach one night before a thunderstorm pushed us back to our own resort. When you're tired of the beach, the Ala Moana shopping center is basically right across the street, and Waikiki itself is very walkable directly from the hotel. We walked to a good vantage point to watch the parade the day after thanksgiving, and then rushed back to the resort to see the Friday night fireworks.Parking is convenient to the tower, but expensive. However, when you have a kitchen if you take a trip to the grocery store and eat in for a few meals, you can pretty much make up for the parking charges right there. While it is expensive, it's a flat daily fee with in/out privileges.We checked out on a Saturday to head to the cruise port, and the lobby area (open air) was an absolute mess with the hordes of people all checking out. I don't know that there's much the property can do about that, as it's probably just a once-a-week occurrence. But it's something to be aware of. It took us about 30 minutes from when we got to the lobby until we were in a cab heading to the cruise port.All in all, I was very happy with the stay here. We definitely didn't stay here long enough (only 5 nights) to do everything the resort had to offer, and we are planning another trip. Next summer we'll be staying in a 2-bedroom for another 5 nights. I honestly wouldn't pick any other Waikiki property.","Cincinnati, Ohio","NathanPond</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>",11,5.0

The shopping and dinning are so fun and convenient. Our favorites are Lamperts for ice cream, the Honolulu Cookie Company and the Pizza place. There are a lot of other restaurants walking distance or a quick bus ride away. We always rent a car, but it's fun to walk to dinner in the area. The pools are great. My kids love the water slides and we all love the lagoon. We like to rent all of the toys (my favorite is the SUP) and the kids bring their snorkels to see fish and turtles right there in the lagoon. You can spend hours just floating around in lagoon on an inner tube bought from Target. I have stayed in the hotel once, and I will pay whatever it takes to be in the timeshares instead.

The unit was beautiful and very big. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, full kitchen - every thing you need. It was fantastic for our family of five. We booked a garden view and i was a bit worried about what our view would be. We had a corner unit with two balconies. The back balcony looked over the road and a carpark but the side balcony had a view of the great lawn and lagoon and beach - it was beautiful and perfect!!! From the back balcony you could see the resorts Luau each night - by night 10 i was a bit over it though!!! So loud! Also if they have a function on the great lawn it is very noisy. They had one the first day we arrived and after no sleep on our flight over it was awful as the children kept waking to the sound of loud drums and singing! Lucky they don't have functions on every night. We had housekeeping daily - all very satisfactory.The Lagoon Tower also had its own check in - when we arrived no one was waiting and the lady at check in was lovely. Compared to the main check in where i never saw a line of less than 20 people i was very grateful for this.The resort is huge - very much a village but we loved it! It was very busy and children everywhere. The pools were packed and there was never an empty pool lounge but if you wait a few minutes people are always coming and going. There isn't enough shade by the pools though especially in the middle of summer. My children loved the beach so the fact the resort was on the beach is perfect. There were so many options..beach, pool, lagoon - it was perfect. Only a 10 minute walk into town too!We ate at Tropics, the pizza store and got numerous items from the ABC store as well. It had everything you need. We ate brekky in our room every day all with items purchased from ABC Store. For lunches you can have ready made sandwiches and salads too - all very nice. You couldn't order food to eat by the pool - you had to go and get it yourself but you could order drinks. It was expensive to hire beach umbrellas and chairs from the resort - crazy you have to pay for shade when you are paying so much for the resort. If you walk down the beach a bit SUP's and umbrellas, chairs are cheaper. Surf lessons should be done on the iconic Waikiki Beach - a lot better than at the resort.The resort was great - we loved it but its huge and there is nothing personal about it. I would recommend it though and stay there again.","Sydney, Australia","kjt313</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",47,4.0

When making reservation through Hilton Grand Vacation Club, I paid more to upgrade from no view to an ocean view - we didn't get it when we arrived. I called from the lobby to complain and was basically told there was nothing in the notes about an view - just a request for a separate living room with a kitchen. That is not what I asked for when upgrading. You can't control what they put in the notes in their system, but you're stuck with what you get on arrival. I told them I wanted a refund for the upgrade I paid for, but I didn't get that either. I was given $100 Hilton dollars that I could only spend on the property. I was basically told I was a liar. The hotel property itself is nice. But be careful in trusting the HGVC people.

We wrote a lengthy complaint on a HGVC form provided by our long-term Sales Rep. As we were leaving for our return, the Resort Manager who had evidently seen the complaint approached us and promised to do better on our next visit. If you look at my review for our stay in 2014, we were less than enthralled with issues that were not resolved to our satisfaction by this same Resort Manager.Our room which did not face Diamond Head but an ""eyesore hotel"" next door to the property was located adjacent to the elevators. The noise and vibration caused by the operation of the elevators was a source of sound intrusion day and night. Particularly disturbing for those in master bedroom and trying to get to sleep at night.During this stay, we received 2 notices that puts a damper on things:1. June 1, 2016--On June 2nd from 10:30 am to 4:30 pm you will not have any hot water supply.2.June 2, 2016--On June 3rd from 11:30 pm to 4:00 am you will not have any hot or cold water service.The room renovations and furniture/appliance upgrades that were made are OK. The furniture for our 2 bedroom Penthouse was very basic, non-descript, and functional. The appliances were not of a superior nature. The shower heads were not full flow water; it took us 3 times as long to shower and rinse that it does normally. I would have preferred a larger shower head, higher up with full water blast versus the Japanese toilet seat in the master bathroom which boasted remote controls, heated seat, and bidet functions. Plus no washer and dryer in your room it is down the hall for you to access with everyone else on the floor. By the way they are in the rooms at the Grand Waikiki'an!Why have a gate at the pool if you're not going to supervise the non-guests who seemingly walk-in without key access or those who simply jump over the unguarded pool gates? This has happened year after year at the Paradise Pool and we have complained to no avail. That and under age children in hot-tub/whirlpools is prevalent and not enforced by staff.Overall, our whole experience as Lagoon Tower Penthouse Owners was not up to the expected HGVC standards or the HOA maintenance fees and taxes paid annually.","College Station, Texas","Tomisine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>College Station, Texas</strong>",50,2.0

It was about 80% parking lot/hotel and 20% ocean. The hotel manager has addressed this on other reviews stating that you can technically see some ocean and that people should have booked an ocean front room. ""Ocean view"" is an industry standard term. You don't get to make up your own definition for it. The room we had was a resort or island view, maybe a partial ocean view or obstructed ocean view. We received a letter in our room that we would have no hot water from 10:30a-4:30p on our last day. No offer to compensate guests for 6 hours without hot water. By 6pm, the hot water still wasn't on and I had to take a cold shower to get ready for dinner. I called the concierge about it twice. The first employee had no idea the hot water was going to be off that day and said she would call back after asking about it. She never called back. The second employee cheerfully said the hot water would be back on at 5:30pm. This was at 6pm. I finally had to ask for some compensation for 7.5 hours without hot water. I was given a $100 resort credit. I thought the property was beautiful, but I would stay somewhere else next time. We really wanted an ocean view (which is why we booked one). It's sad that the staff can't understand why that would be disappointing. I also can't believe they wouldn't offer any type of compensation to everyone that had no hot water for an entire day.

We booked using points rented privately through a HGVC member.The resort its self is large with lots to do. The pools are hectic and there isn't much in the way of staff supervision. On one occasion in the Tapa pool some young teenagers were playing rough and throwing balls around the pool. It wasn't enjoyable to sit around with this going on so we moved on to another pool. I'm not against pool games but it was rowdy and there were no staff to calm the situation down. The other pools were always busy but in general you could get a chair close by. The kids pool in the super pool area doesn't have any seating around it which is odd considering that it is a kids pool. There is the Hau Tree Bar right next door, we went for lunch and a few drinks and could watch the kids swim at the same time.Lagoon pool was fun but again, always very busy.Don't expect to have a serene cocktail by the pool experience, this resort is go go go all of the time. There is a pool up in the Kalia tower that seemed much quieter but its a bit of a hike to get to if you arent staying at that tower.The food options are OK, nothing special and again very busy. We didn't eat in at any of the restaurants for dinner, instead opting for the walk into Waikiki or getting take out and eating in our rooms.The rooms in the lagoon tower have recently been renovated and are really nice. The one bedroom was easily big enough for a family (King in the bedroom and a pull out sofa in the lounge) and the small but well equipped kitchen made it possible to make breakfast / lunch etc.We had family staying in a 2 bedroom suite and it was massive (2 bedrooms with a king and twin beds plus a pull out in the lounge). The lounge, kitchen and dining room were huge and easily accommodated us all for dinner etc.We have travelled to Hawaii many times and for us the location of the resort wasn't convenient. We only stayed here as were were travelling with family who wanted to stay and they did enjoy the location and facilities.

Our room (for two adults) was clean, comfortable and plenty of hot water. It was a basic room with no balcony - we chose this as it was a cheaper option. The rest of our family, daughter, son-in-law and two grandchildren, aged 5 and 2, had a very large two bedroom suite with lounge area. Their balcony looked over the lagoon and out to the ocean. The Hilton Waikiki is a great place for children with kid friendly pools, shallow in some parts, and with three water slides, which our five year old grandson loved. The lagoon is also a great place for the children, with paddle boats (for a cost) and the beach is also lovely and very warm. We ate at the Tropics restaurant on a couple of occasions and the meals were enjoyable though perhaps a little expensive. The staff were, on the whole, friendly and helpful, although we did strike some on the front desk who were, perhaps, having a bad day! It is an easy 10 - 15 minute walk to Ala Moana shopping centre and about 20 mins to the busy downtown area. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is a very large resort and therefore very busy, the pool was quite crowded. We did only use the one pool because it was more suitable for the children so am not sure what the other one was like.

Thank God for Duke's Lagoon and the massive beach to offer some relief. Get there early for a chair.Check-in around 3-4pm on a weekend is K-razy packed so be prepared for a long wait - especially at the Grand Vacations check-in which covers the Kalia, Waikikian and Lagoon towers. I counted 4 staff checking people in at prime time! There was literally a line to board 3 elevators in the Lagoon tower at 4pm on a Saturday!!Other than that, staff is friendly and surprisingly patient considering the mayhem. Our room in the Lagoon tower was fantastic and completely renovated. Highly recommend Lagoon tower for closest to pool and beach. Kalia is significantly back from the water.No presumptions here but be prepared for a significant number of foreign visitors at this resort. Oahu is most popular for non US visitors and HHV attracts a lot of them.In summary, Hilton GV has the right moves on most properties but due to a variety of factors they are working hard to maximize their waikiki property for profitability at the cost of visitor comfort. Sure there's 20 restaurants but there is very little open space in an area (waikiki) which is already dense with tourists!

Again, very loud but incredible, & can't believe they do it every week!Restaurants around the resort complex include a number of Japanese restaurants, a pizza restaurant (eat-in & take-out), a pub-style bar/deli, an Italian restaurant, a fish & chips shop (eat-in & take-out, with HUGE number of choices & very cheap), a couple of bars (big shout-out to Cindy at the Tapa Bar!) & Pronto Pickle joints serving poolside snack-type foods, plus ice cream & coffee shop. Had to walk to main shopping area for more choice of better restaurants though (15min walk). ABC stores on-site provide limited supermarket & alcohol supplies + some pre-prepared meals, as well as touristy souvenirs (cheap but good Hawaiian shirts!). Save all your receipts from every ABC store purchase & redeem them for a free gift before you leave - spend $100 & get a coffee mug or shopping bag, or $300 gets you an excellent beach bag, towel or t-shirt!We were charged compulsory resort charge of US$30/day which entitled us to 2 bottles water per day, DVD rental (which we didn't use), cultural activities & morning yoga classes (which we only did once), family movies by the pool (which we didn't do), some sort of photo (which we didn't do), possibly free access to their Atlantis underwater viewing submarine (which we didn't do), free wifi (only worked in the room, not in public areas) which everyone got anyway I think! So quite a rip-off for us, but if we were more organized we could have got more benefit. Take note! Use what you've paid for!Biggest negative was being hassled about doing a 90 min Time Share ""information session"" & ""receiving a free gift of a whale-watching cruise"" every time we asked the concierge for anything. Particularly as we didn't find the concierges very knowledgable about most things - like shuttle bus times to & from Waikele Outlets (""Come back whatever time you want"" but actually 2.30pm at earliest), or car hire (""What? What? Oh you mean vehicle rental"") or what time to check in for a domestic flight between islands (WAY WAY WAY too early!).Overall though it was a fantastic place to stay, a perfect home away from home. I would highly recommend Hilton Grand Vacations Hawaiian Village to families wanting more space than your average hotel room, plus the benefit of full kitchen facilities.","Doncaster, Australia","MrsAOM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Doncaster, Australia</strong>",32,4.0

Surprising, we’re back in the same suite as last year … unit 770. The suite is great ... spacious, free laundry (down the hall), amazing Paradise pool, concierge service, etc. The noise this year weren’t too bad compared to last year and they have since renovated and fixed the elevators.However, the only complaint I have is housekeeping where they missed cleaning our unit twice. On 2 separate days, our beds were not made and the room was not serviced at all when we returned in the evening. Both times we called housekeeping. The first time, it was already after dinner time (around 8 or 9 pm) so we asked for fresh towels since it was too late to get the room cleaned and we had to put our kids to bed. The second time, we came back around 5 pm and the beds were not made and the room hadn't been cleaned. We asked for someone to come and cleaned the room while we went out to dinner. There were other misses as well .... where they cleaned the room and did not clean out the coffee maker or left the dirty dishes in the dishwasher and not run it. I had to run the dishwasher in the evening in order to have clean dishes for the morning breakfast.We stayed at this same building last March for 10 nights and didn't encounter the same problem. A suggestion … a door sign that indicates the room needs to be made up. Many hotels and cruise lines have a double sided sign indicating “please do not disturb” on one side and “please make up room” on the other side.We’ve just booked another stay for next February.

This resort is in a great location right on the beach compared to many other hotels that are across the street from the beach. The lagoon in front of the resort is also perfect for kids. The hotel has a kids pool with long slides, apparently only 2 hotels in Honolulu have this. Our kids just love it. Being a resort village, one has access to all the amenities right on site. It's about 10 minutes walk into Waikiki in one direction and to the Ala Moana Mall and Walmart in the other direction. Extremely convenient. Lots to do, see and eat. We had stayed in the hotel side of this resort in the past. This year and last year we stayed in the Hilton Grand Vacations because we wanted a suite with a kitchen and there's also a complimentary laundry facility right on the floor. With 5 years old twins, the Grand Vacations rooms and amenities just make more sense. The room rate is the same as a similar sized room on the Hilton Hotel side but those hotel rooms/suites do not have a kitchen. The kids' pool just happens to be right downstairs in this building too so it's very convenient for us. The front desk, bell and concierge staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The cleaning staff are not that friendly. You're greeted with a lei/mac nut necklace upon arrival. The room is well appointed and looks like a very nice condo. We had a one bedroom suite with a pullout sofa bed in the living room. It's about 700 sqft. The room is nice and quiet. The one qualm I have is the water pressure from the shower head is very very weak. Also, during our 11 nights stay, 2 of those days the cleaning staff didn't come to clean our room. The first time, we came back after dinner to find the room unmade. It was too late to have someone come so we just asked for some fresh towels. The second time we came back around 5 pm to find the room unmade so we asked for someone to come up to clean while we went out to dinner. This didn't happen when we stayed last year. There's a resort fee and as a part of this, you get access to movies and games rental. There wasn't much selection whatsoever for games or movies that are appropriate for kids under 10. Luckily we brought our own ipads with movies and games, and we could also access Netflix through wifi, My husband wanted to use the gym while we were there. There's only one small gym located in a separate building at another end of the resort. It doesn't have a lot of equipment so just be aware. There's also a kids club on site but the fee per day is high. We ended up hiring a baby sitter from happykidsmaui.com for 2 evenings. We used them last year as well. The sitter and the over service from Happy Kids were excellent. Overall, we had an excellent stay and have just booked our trip for next February last night. :)","Toronto, Canada","Grace W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

We stayed in the Lagoon tower, a 1 bedroom apartment for 3 adults. Booked last April having read lots of good reviews, then of course just before we flew out, i did the usual thing i guess we all do, i looked again, and all i could see were peoples gripes and negativity . so spent 10 hours on the plane over there convinced we d get the worst rooms, next to the building work !!! How wrong we were....!! It is just awesome. The lagoon tower has had some dodgy reviews in the past, but in our opinion, its the best tower in the quieter part of the resort, had its own check in and was close to everything on site. Yes , there is another tower being built but it is away from the lagoon tower and we were not bothered by it. there seems to be some snobbery about the lagoon tower, and its reffered to as the ""timeshare' accommodation, but it was just great , we cant fault it. Our apartment looked like it hadnt been used before it was in such immaculate shape, obviously newly refurbished from top to bottom, spacious, lovely , modern furniture full sized kitchen and sumptious bed linen. The sofa bed in the lounge was for our adult daughter and unlike most sofa beds, this one had a proper bed mattress, not the thin foam type you usually get in hotels. We had a view of the paradise pool below,the marina and partial lagoon ,sea views from a good sized balcony. All the balconies are well spaced apart from each other . We were not hassled by timeshare sales as previous guests had mentioned, yes there were vouchers for ""free"" prizes and "" 50.000 honors points "" ,in the apartment but they clearly stated in the small print that it was time share promotional stuff and you had to attend a presentation so we never attempted to claim our 'free gifts "" !! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and courteous, the room attendant/maid did a great job and topped up our towels and toiletries daily. Yes, its a huge resort, but with lovely gardens and pools, ornamental waterfalls etc, and yet everything was so clean and tidy. We are fortunate to be able to take our holidays anytime and i guess that in school holidays , the place is packed full, which is why we avoid those times. There is so much space to wander around the resort both on and off the beach and pool areas, it never felt crowded and never had to wait to be served at any of the bars or restaurants, unlike when we went for a walk to the Moana Surfrider Hotel, supposedly a 5 start hotel where we encountered surly staff, had to wait to get served and saw they had a rammed full, squashed pool area, no thanks, couldnt wait to get back to the Hilton Village ! A great resort, both family and couple friendly brilliant location, we couldnt fault it and i would love to go back BUT..our problem has started since we returned, i booked and paid back in April thru a high street, well known travel agency, who use via expedia , on check out, 5th March , i was told we had to pay USD $2777 approx, whoa, i said, its all pre paid by agent and expedia, heres my reciept , the clerk said, oh , yes, that fine, so off we went to start our reluctant journey home, on tuesday, i was checking my credit card statement, and to my horror, the hilton had charged me that amount after we had left. So, since then, i ve been battling to get it refunded, yes, its an error i ve been told, and it will be processed, but will take days to come off my statement, at which time its gaining intrest every day, and fluctuating exchange rates will likely leave me out of pocket even today, its still on my visa account. Suffice to say, this has spoiled an otherwise truly wonderful stay in Hawaii. Apparently, they had us down for 2 rooms in error, a system glitch by someone,some where but our agent and expedia rectified that back in April and even when i emailed the Hilton just before we went, ( i explained it was my husbands 50th birthday and was a surprise ) i was asked to confirm how many rooms we had booked,as their system said 2 so i confirmed then on 7th feb that we had only the 1 apartment. So still they charged me AFTER check out, without my consent, fingers crossed i get my refund this week as its AUD $3997 , so lets see how good the Admin team are at this resort, as everyone else has been brilliant","Adelaide, Australia","toni w</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",13,5.0

The Kalia Suites is farthest from the beach but houses the spa and fitness center, the Grand Waikikian is newest, and the Lagoon Tower is closest to the beach and oldest...but is in the midst of a complete renovation. We stayed in the Lagoon Tower.I cannot praise this property highly enough. We LOVE that it is right on the beach, that it is an easy walk to the rest of Waikiki in one direction and Ala Moana in the other, that 90% of what we want to do on Oahu is less than a 20 minute drive away, and that the suites themselves are large and comfortable with full kitchens and with washer/dryers on each floor. And that most of the rooms have great views of the ocean and Diamond Head or the harbor and the pool next to the Lagoon tower has awesome waterslides and hot pools. And that there is a Lapperts downstairs offering amazing Kona coffee starting at 5:30 (for those of us with jet lag) and Hawaiian ice cream all day. And that Honolulu offers some of the best food we've ever eaten anywhere in the world thanks to the fusion of Asian, Polynesian, and European heritage and ingredients but when we are just too exhausted to do anything else we can just go down and eat at one of the many HHV restaurants.We've been bringing our kids and parents to the HHV every other year for 9 years now. This year for the first time we splurged and got one of the few oceanfront (not just oceanview) rooms at the Lagoon Tower - and it was completely worth it. Are there nicer places to stay in Waikiki if you are just a couple - absolutely. But once you have kids (and/or parents) with whom you want to stay there is simply no place better.Lastly a note for all those Hilton Diamond reviewers who complain about the HGVC at HHV mistreating them. For whatever reason Hilton has made a corporate decision to treat the HGVC as a completely separate entity. Neither I nor the Hilton reservation staff can see my HGVC reservation in the Hilton system. HGVC stays don't count toward my elite status and my Hilton elite status doesn't affect my HGVC room selection. Marriott doesn't work this way - even though MVCI is a separate company (just like HGVC). Marriott tracks my MVCI reservations in their system, my MVCI stays count toward my Marriott status (most importantly my lifetime goals), and MVCI resorts 'care' about your Marriott elite status.So please, please, do complain to Hilton corporate about their decision to ignore us when we visit HGVC properties. But HHV is just following Hilton's policies and procedures.","NY, NY","Leo M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NY, NY</strong>",278,5.0

It took a few days to become familiar with the various parts of the village and even then I don't think we covered it all. The village itself is a very busy place with constant flows of guests walking the streets - not so much the beach surprisingly. If it's a relaxing time your seeking I probably wouldn't be considering the Hilton.We had a 2 bedroom suite which was absolutely perfect for ourselves and our 3 teens. On average the size of the suite is probably bigger than the size of some people's average 3 bdrm home. The main bdrm was luxuriously huge and the ensuites were adequate. Our suite had been recently renovated with a contemporary modern touch and the cleaning was tops! - thank you to our maids.The swimming pool areas were small and given the number of guests this property accommodates, they appear far from adequate. Our kids chose to swim at the pool area where there were pool slides. This pool is located on a dark side of the building so wasn't an appealing place to sunbathe or relax. The other main pool area often looked crowded and the seating area is very squashed looking.Both reception and concierge were very helpful and nicely pleasant with socially engaging conversations with ourselves and our kids. Any enquiries/requests made to both reception and housekeeping were answered and met straight away. Our welcome with leis and beads on arrival was a nice touch and Honolulu-like...aloha!We ate within the village at the Tropic restaurant a few nights. The menu wasn't that great but the service from staff was really nice and went out of their way to accommodate us - thanks Brian. There was live music each night as well which were really good and made our night. It's expensive and there are cheaper but still nice places nearby you can wonder out to.We felt the beach was a bit of an overstatement. Although I think that's because we're spoilt for beaches in New Zealand. The sand was gristly and felt hard underneath, i.e. you could wriggle down into the sand if you wanted to. Overall the Hilton Grand vacations is a nice property and we found all staff to be very helpful. Some staff were looking to help us even if we hadn't asked them - that's awesome. I had read in other reviews that people regarded Hilton visitors like a factory-run business - we didn't find this at all and staff at all levels from ground-staff upwards were all so pleasant and helpful.

Upon an early arrival in the morning, check-in staff insisted on a 4pm check in time, so we hung around the shopping just around Hawaiian Village. Ended up sitting next to a fish pond with security wondering what we were doing with the fish in the pond for hours.I booked a 2 bedroom at the Lagoon Tower. It had an apartment style setting and the quality of the room was true to its Hilton name. The site was well maintained for a time-shared property. There were 2 balconies at the room we stayed at, one facing the man-made beach, and the other onto the rooftop of the car park where there are shows happening every night. Every Friday, there is also fireworks at the man-made beach and the view was just to die for. I spent a day sleeping outside on the balcony on a high floor and it was just awesome all rounds.Here are my standard pros and cons:Pros:- Convenience of food and shopping (ABC store) within walking distance- Very discreet room service (ninjas in action)- Super friendly staff (sorta like something out of Disney movies - lilo and stitch comes to mind)- Discount vouchers for Hawaiian Village offered on check in- Nice sun tans on the balconies (but I did get a heat stroke after spending the whole day sleeping in the sun. Serves me right for being an idiot)- Laundry rooms for washing clothes- Great for families who want a ""controlled"" environmentCons: - Can get expensive in the Village (hence most guests are in their 30s-80s possibly due to their sheer amount of wealth accumulated on their pension funds or massive credit card bills)- Got bitten by ONE mosquitoes/sand fly at a high floor. I can't imagine what a lower floor would have to go through- Parking can be confusing (after the first time, you should be right)- Random people yelling in the middle of the night (not Hilton's fault, more like crazy tourists with brain problems)- Time shared property so you will get asked to attend their seminars (a lot)- Noise level can get out of control outside of normal sleeping times (easily fixed with closing windows and turn on the air con)- Self Parking is $24 a day (got given a pass to go in and out of car park during my stay) I think for the amount of $ paid for the rooms, this should really be included.If you are interested in my experience please read on (or you can choose to not be bored to death).I was there during Holoween and it was quite an experience. Hilton had something set up in front of the hotel lawn. It was great for photos and Facebook.Just a note, get a rental car to drive around. Walking downtown or to Ala Moana can be a challenge in 30 degree celcius heat/ 86 fahrenheit. Every time I walked around, it felt like I am being showered in my own sweat. That meant having to wash or buy new clothes. I guess those hawaiian t-shirts that I wear around does look ""unique"" in Australia.This hotel is quite close (15 min walk) to Ala Moana shopping centre or strip mall as you Americans call it (nobody strips). It has every shop (I can think of) under the sun. A short walk the other way is downtown and you will find all the big named brands like Gucci, LV, etc. I'm pretty sure my cracked credit card (due to overuse) is a testament of the sheer amount of things you can buy. Looking forward to my replacement credit card soon.Hilton Honors Gold did make a difference as we were offered to access to Executive lounge.Hope you enjoy this hotel as much as me writing this review.","Brisbane, Queensland, Australia","Jasper H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Queensland, Australia</strong>",28,5.0

The village has everything you need, but is a little more expensive then the rest of Waikiki. For a Hilton resort I expected more in the customer service realm, but I think they have gotten so big that they no longer have the luxury to care about its guests individual experiences. Here's my pros/cons if you're debating. Just as an FYI for management: We stayed in 1168 and 1166 at lagoon tower while there with our family during Thanksgiving week.Pros: rooms are a nice size and can provide lots of room for a big family with children: living room, balcony and bed room(s) with great views-fully capable kitchens with dish washing detergent, trash bags and paper towels.-cleaning crew comes once mid-week-The front ocean front suite at lagoon tower was great for Friday fireworks. -The resort has several fun pools-each have their own cool feature so try all of them. The tappas pool was the best for babies because it has a shallow area with bubbles. The lagoon pool has lots of slides and it was really fun, but the water was super cold.-The village has several restaurants that were coco enemy, but most of them lacked quality and reasonable prices so I would else where for dinner. Lunch was convo enemy to have there. I recommend pronto pickle for breakfast. -DVD rental: free unlimited DVD rentals during your stay. There were lots of current movies available.-They provide towels for pools but you have to return them to get a new towel rental card. Each card is $10. This was a hassle, but I understand it.Cons:-There was mold all over our shower head cord in 1166. It had been there a long time. It was easy to wipe off too because I did it. --Cleaning crew turned on one of the stove burners and left it on high. It was the one with an empty tea kettle. We found it hours later. -Hotel customer service lacked initiative or desire to please customers. The feel I got was that the staff there let the location of Waikiki and name of Hilton say it all. They made no attempt to make the guests experience memorable like other resorts I've stayed. Examples below:-We tried to get a taxi at lagoon tower and we had to interrupt 2 hotel staff members whose job is to find out where we want to go and then whistle to the taxi in line. They kept talking even after we arrived and stood next to them and they made eye contact with us. Finally after a couple mins, my husband, annoyed with them, interrupted and they kindly got us a taxi.-They are doing renovations, so before you book, call to ask what week they're renovating each floor. At Thanksgiving they were doing the 12th floor and it was SO loud. We had a baby who was woken up. We called several times to complain. It woke us up a couple days and our neighbors came to us because they also had a baby woken up. The front desk gave us $50 credit on our first complaint, but then apologized for every call afterwards. They were supposed to be moving down to the 11th floor soon. -There are two hot tubs at lagoon, but despite having signs that say a max 9 and no one under 5 yrs old allowed, I never saw it without those rules broken. At one point there were 25 people in both tubs and several people had floaties in their arms, so yes they were under 5. -The rentals for the tiny lagoon are CRAZY expensive. A paddle board for 1 hour is $41 with tax. Just go to the beach down the side walk and it's $25. I think it should be more reasonable prices for guests who are paying to stay here!In summary, it's a beautiful place that provides everything you need in the village, for the right price of course. It was a lot of fun, but I wouldn't expect a lot of extras besides a place to sleep and shower and cool pools near by. This place is massive and has thousands of guests each week so expect crowded pools and average to less than average customer service.

This was my second stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village...the first being at the Grand Waikikian. I had a roomy two-bedroom suite with an ocean view. The room was nice, but it was clear that the property is in need of renovations. The furniture had very noticeable chips, scratches, and scraps. I found a 1/2"" hole in the bathroom wall at the paper dispenser. The sleeper sofa was quite worn. On the positive, all appliances worked well, though the main television required some maintenance (sound with no picture a couple of times).I had added an additional two nights onto this stay. This required moving into a different two-bedroom suite because the ocean view room I originally booked had no availability past the originally book six nights.The second room was even roomier, but again, the need for renovations was quite evident. I found trim around the floor to be badly in need of replacement. The sofa was also worn, and the tables had similar chips, scratches, and scrapes.The front desk was adequately responsive to any concerns. The AC unit in the second room malfunctioned, and it took about one hour for this to be corrected. It turned out to be a very minor problem, and the repairman was very efficient.Concierge was helpful for all of my needs. The cleaning service was very good.You will need to be prepared to pay premium dollar for items (food and otherwise) at the stores and restaurants in the village, but this shouldn't surprise anyone. There are plenty of places to purchase food and souvenirs within easy walking distance of the resort.Overall, the Lagoon Tower is a nice place to stay. However, if you are more interested in a more luxurious location, including having in-room washer/dryer and whirlpool tub, then choose the Grand Waikikian instead. In spite of the fact that I was closer to the water by staying in the Lagoon Tower, i will definitely look to the Waikikian the next time.

Not a bad deal $799 for 6 days. I was specific that I could only travel if I had a business center access. Having stayed in Hilton's around the world, I was shocked to learn that the HIlton Business Center here is NOT 24-hours and you have to PAY FOR USING IT. Coupled with a sluggishly slow internet connection in the rooms, the inability to work while traveling at the HIlton Hawaiian Village was incredibly ridiculous. As a single mother who owns my own business, I can only travel with my children when I am certain I can use a business center or internet connection during prime business hours on the mainland. The sales team lied directly when they told me the business center was 24 hours. I mentioned it to the hotel and I was given another wifi password - which was also sluggishly slow. Top that off with this is the only HIlton I have ever stayed at that had no room service, and you can call the vacation frustrating. On top of that the food on the property is super expensive and pedestrian. If I wanted to go to an overpriced Benihana or eat hamburgers and hot dogs, I could have stayed in NY or LA. The food here lacks the cultural emphasis one would wish for on a Hawaiian vacation. Also, the luau that were were given tickets to as part of the package was c classic rubber chicken style hotel event. It was held in a conference center and not on the beach so it really had the feel of a obligatory business dinner in a cheap hotel, not a rich Hawaiian flair one would except. Thumbs way down.

The room was beautifully updated with crown modeling, flat screen tv, the room had 2 lanai's. We were lucky enough to stay in an ocean front end unit and it was so worth. To be able to wake up and see the ocean every morning was just amazing. My only compliant is the bathroom did have a smell of cigarettes so not sure if a prior guest smoked in the restaurant or if it was bad venting system. I highly recommend the tower, the lobby is small and never crowded, there is a starbucks in the tower which is convenient and you can literally walk out the room on to the main road. The pool is pretty small, the spa was a little disappointing in terms of amenities.

Granted, back then I was a HHonors Diamond member and was upgraded to a very nice suite in the Tapa tower. But then, after a stay at the Hilton Seychelles property (see my review on tripadvisor) during which I was downgraded (yes, downgraded) from an Ocean front villa to a regular villa, I swore to switch my business over to a different brand and I did. 8 years later, I decided to see if it was worth giving back my business to Hilton. The short answer is: no. This year, I tried the Hilton Vacations Suite at the Hawaiian Village which is the time-share property in the Hilton Hawaiian resort. We arrived at around 10.30pm after a very long day (we flew all the way from France - no less than 13 hours on two different planes) and pulled into the main lobby driveway with our rental car. There was not a single staff member to help us out with our luggages or with our car (we wanted to valet park). We waited a good 10 minutes. Finally, someone showed up and asked us what we wanted. Ok, if we stop on a driveway where you are supposed to stop to valet park, what is really the purpose of asking us what we wanted? Anyway, we kindly explained we wanted to valet park. The staff member gave us a receipt and drove our car away, not offering any assistance with our luggages. We made our way to the main lobby where someone - who did not bother to ask the simple questions they train clerks to ask, like ""how are you today?"", ""where are you visiting us from?"" - asked us for our name. We did show our reservation print-out and were told we had not stopped at the right place. Hilton - word of advice : when people book at your facility, kindly tell them in an email where to stop and where to check-in. It is nasty to have to stop in one place (after 13 hours on two different planes) only to be told it is the wrong place. We were told to check-in at the Kalia tower, which we did. There, a clerk checked our booking and gave my friends key cards to their room. No polite questions, no information about the resort, not a single nice word welcoming us to the resort. I found out that my booking was yet in a different tower - the Lagoon tower. We asked the clerk if I could also have a room in the Kalia tower. After twenty minutes on the phone, he finally said no and I was sent to the other side of the resort to check-in at the Lagoon tower. Needless to say, by that time I was pretty furious and thought: ""now I remember why I said: Hilton, never again"".I arrived at the Lagoon tower and found out, with horror, that my room was right next to an elevator. As in, the door that you would not believe is a a door leading to a bedroom. You would think that that door (room 1071) would lead to a janitor closet. No, it was actually the door to a bedroom. Amazing! And what happened to my online prefrence ""away from elevator""? Ah, sorry, this is Hilton standard. I opened the room and discovered what Hilton calls a ""studio"". Needless to say, this is just a more fancy way of saying ""bedroom"" with a kitchinette. The room was SO outdated. I had read the reviews here on tripadvisor and unfortunately, they are all true. Those studios are really dated. But you know what, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was decent, the kitchen area was neat. So, apart from the decor which is really old, I have no major complaint about the ""studio"" except that I paid $260/night + taxes: I am afraid to say that this is clearly not worth it. As in, not worth it at all. In the lobby of the Lagoon tower, they had displays of the future makeover due to start in september 2015. The rooms will be beautiful then (and the room of my friends in the Kalia tower was truly beautiful). But there will still be one major issue with the studios in the Lagoon tower: no proper windows. So, you feel really cut out from the world in those studios.Otherwise, I really liked the Lagoon tower. It has a ""vintage"" touch which makes it, in my view, the best tower on the property.Lots of people complain about Honolulu and its gigantic resorts made of concrete. I do not. Do people realize that when these resorts were built, they also embodied a dream, that of affording nice vacations to a larger spectrum of the population? This is what I love about the Hilton Village. It is definitely ""inclusive"", whereas newer resorts strive on ""exclusive""-ness and truly sabotage the dream of vacations in Paradise for the mainstream that represents Waikiki and its big resorts.The resort itself is really nicely located, in the heart of everything you could possibly want. Shops, beaches, restaurants, excursions, you name it.I love the fact that the resort is like a small city. I like the fact that it is crowded. I like the fact that it is anonymous and that you can blend in, without any expectation on the part of the property. You come in just as you are.I would have loved to find a note in my room saying ""welcome back"", given that is was my second stay at the resort. It is good practice to acknowledge returning customers. Is Hilton aware of this? Apparently not.The resort has 2 ABC Shops where I bought fresh fruits in the morning for breakfast ($7 for a small cup of fresh fruits is a bit steep but I guess this is the price to pay in this location). I had coffee at the Starbuck's stand in the Kalia tower.We tried the Benihana restaurant on property which was decent.I found it unacceptable to have to pay for lounge chairs around the lagoon (they will nickel and dîme you).I do have to acknowledge the cleaning staff who did my room. Wow! Cleaning was always impeccable. Great job. Thank you very much.3 days was not enough. I wished I could have stayed more but my next adventure awaited me (a cruise around the Hawaiian islands).Upon checking-out, the clerk was really cold. She did not offer any assistance for a cab or with my luggages. She handed me out the bill and I was the one to say ""good bye"". I got barely a smile back.All in all, I really liked my experience at the resort. I have highlighted the deficiencies above. My main complaint goes to Hilton as a brand: they just do not - as in NOT - have any proper regard for their customers. I felt like a cow ready to be milked. What a shame. Will I switch my business back over to Hilton? Hell, no. I have one more stay coming up at a Doubletree in Anaheim and I expect nothing short of the worst in terms of customer service.

Prior to arrival, I had requested for a higher floor and quiet location away from the elevators. Guess what's? They stuck us on the 10th floor right across from the elevators. As Elite Premier members who own at this property, we were very unhappy. Our suite faced out to the lawn and had a full view of the parking lot where luau happened five nights a week, from 5 to well after 10 PM. I placed a call downstairs as soon as we got to our suite and realized we had a bad location. The front desk staff were oblivious, unapologetic and utterly useless. One lady I talked to told me that's the only location for this type of suite, which I think is a lie. But being that it was 11PM at night, I did not argue with her. A couple of nights during our stay, they had catering functions on the lawn and it was party full-on. Wednesday movie nights were also loud. We had two preschoolers with us on this trip, and luckily they were so tired every day they went to bed despite the racket outside. On the plus side, the location is pretty convenient. We walked to Ala Moana mall and to the main drag. Both ways about 15 minutes. The kids loved the lagoon. They were however disappointed when the pool police came and told us we could not use any floats in the pool. Don't eat at the restaurant by pool. They charge $11 for a California roll and $11 for a beer. I also got attacked by a pigeon while eating my food. We loved the other restaurants at the resorts. CJ's, Round Table Pizza, and the Japanises restaurant by the gigantic bird cage that offers half price sushi between 5-6PM. The beds were really comfortable. We only had housekeeping twice but they were very generous with the toiletries.The lagoon tower has three elevators, of which one of them was always broken. Plus they don't have a service elevator. From day two on, we had to press the elevators to go up first, then go down to the lobby. Otherwise there was no chance for the six of us all getting in. It's bit of a joke that some of their staff on the 3rd or 4th floor did not want to use the stairs and made the crowding situation worse. Anyways, that's Waikiki for you. Hot, crowded, touristy. But the kids loved it, and we had a great time inspite of these issues.

The resort is great for families with young children with the best pools, slides, lagoon pool and onsite activities in Waikiki. The down side is that the resort is enormous and has thousands of rooms and hosts conferences (for thousands of people!). When this occurs there are people everywhere and the activity is frenzied. Poolside chairs become a premium and there are queues everywhere.The resort is also getting tired and one of the 3 lifts breaks down at least every second day so there are queues just to get to your room. Coupled with the building not having a service lift the poor housekeeping staff & bell guys also try to squeeze in to 2 lifts that service a 24 floor building - this part is outrageous.Apart from that, the suite sizes are decent with decent size kitchen, dining, living and bedrooms. Updating is definitely required with beds & carpets showing age.I have listed a lot of negatives, but must stress that in previous years our stays were great. Our daughter enjoyed kids club in previous years (when she was 5-8) and we still love Tropics Bar, the private beach, lagoon and proximity to Ala Moana shops.

It felt a little older than the Lagoon Tower and the 1 bedroom PLUS just felt smaller - not by much, but it may just be the lay-out. I was not up-front (as far as the ocean and the view) but at the back of the HHV facility. I didn't spend as much time enjoying the entire facility as I had in April at Lagoon Tower. The staff seemed to be more friendly but that may be because Lagoon Tower was undergoing a lobby and elevator renovations then. Overall the 9-day stay was perfect and the only disappointment that I had was that my Wi-Fi went down one day but as soon as the tech worked on it the Wi-Fi just flew. The facility is always fun to be in and there is plenty to do without even leaving the premises. Even if you do leave there are plenty of restaurants, beaches and malls adjacent to the premises on both sides. To the west there is the Ala Moana Mall and the Ala Moana Beach Park with restaurants galore on Ala Moana Blvd. To the east there is Fort DeRussey museum beach and the Beachwalk with more restaurants and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center plus the remainder of Waikiki.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Jeffrey H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",66,4.0

You do however receive 2 complimentary bottles of H20 and 2000 bonus Hhonors points. Now about the Kalia tower. It is definitely the furthest tower from the beach but the closest tower to the parking structure. There is a Starbucks on the ground floor and has its own gym, pool & spa. The recently renovated accommodations were perfect for my family of 3. We reserved the 1 Bedroom Mountain View Suite (w/ sofa bed, full kitchen, 1 bathroom) and received exactly that. It was modern and had unworn furniture. Next time I would definitely pay the extra $$ to get an ocean view since we are in Hawaii. The gym was fairly small for the size of the tower but has all the cardio and weight equipment one would need. But if you're a runner, don't bother w/ the gym, there's a great running path on the strand. The pool seemed empty whenever I passed by it on my way to the gym but was open fairly early if you need to get towels. Housekeeping is daily and did a good job despite the fact that I forgot to tip them one day :(This is my 2nd trip to the HHV and my 1st was at the Ali'i Tower (see my review) which I prefer over the Kalia but obviously more $$. Also, by booking w/ HGVC you don't pay the $30 daily resort fee like you do w/ Ali'i. However, at the time I made the booking it was Kalia @ $389/night or Ali'i @ $750+$30 resort fee/night. Back in December the Ali'i was only $450+30/night.I found the beach area closest to the lagoon to be better since it tends to be more rocky once you go past the dock. Beware that when renting equipment at the lagoon, you can only use them @ the lagoon. So if you are looking to go in the ocean be sure to rent from the vendors near the park @ Hale Koa.Food @ HHV was just okay, definitely not gourmet. Although it will be expensive wherever you go, you have more options elsewhere literally w/in walking distance. Do venture out!!!I would still definitely return to the HHV.","Los Angeles, California","lv2trvlevrywer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",92,4.0

It's great for families that like to keep dining costs lower by buying groceries and eating in the room. Proximity to the beach and pools are key. The valet is much improved over the last few years and getting in and out of the hotel is much easier than the snarling traffic through the main part of the Hilton Hawaiian Village, where stretch limos block roads for no good reason other than they're too long.The elevators are slow and often so crowded that you may have to wait for another car or two during peak times. The building used to be residential years ago so it doesn't have a service elevator. Housekeeping and other staff use the same elevators, and oftentimes I wonder if their frustration with waiting for an elevator exceeds the guests. But...whatever...you're on vacation. Take a chill pill and roll with it. It is a little annoying that some guests are unaware of the etiquette of queuing for a lift. Some guests make a beeline for any open door even when there is an obvious line in the lobby. Those who do that seem to be older, so I suspect it's a cultural thing that they expect to go first based on seniority. Lagoon Tower is the best solution for my family when we travel to Honolulu. When staying here, it's like having one foot in and one out of Waikiki. You don't have to deal with much of the Waikiki traffic, but you're still central. ",,JKinLAS,13,4.0

This was my second time staying in the Lagoon Tower and once again, it did not disappoint. I shared the room with five of my friends, and there was enough room to fit us all comfortably. Since I had been there a few years before, I requested the same room. One of the managers for Hilton Grand Vacations, Keiko Warner-Egami, who I was in contact with before the trip was so helpful in accommodating my requests. I couldn't be more grateful for the wonderful service she provided. I was visiting for my sister's wedding, so most of my family members stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village, and compared to the other rooms I saw at the Rainbow Tower and Diamond Head Tower, the Lagoon Tower is far better, in my opinion. Yes, it is pricey, but I think it is worth every penny. From my room we could see the Lagoon, Friday night fireworks, and amazing views of the ocean. The full size kitchen is one of the best parts as we were able to cook, bring food/snacks and store them in the pantry and the fridge. The conveniency of checking in at the Grand Waikikian and not dealing with the main lobby at the HHV is another plus. The only downside I can think of are the elevators. There are only three elevators, and since the hotel is crowded it can take a few minutes for one to be available. One of the days our elevator stopped on every floor on our way down. Other than that, I have no complaints. I can't wait to see the Lagoon Tower again when it is fully renovated. Thank you Hilton Grand Vacations for another amazing trip.

I called way in advance about a week or two to start setting up small arrangements for when we arrived. 1. I requested the room be 'dressed up' with flowers and leis..... they did it. They decorated the bedroom with leis on the bed and spelled our HAPPY BDAY with 2 swans made of towels. 2. They decorated the dinning table with the same.. leis all over.. some broken apart and spelling HAPPY BDAY again. 3. They gifted my wife a 10% off spa certificate and some Short bread Hawaiian cookies. ALL ON THEM... I thought it was a great touch by them to decorate like that.

We have been to Oahu a few times over the years prior to owning with HGVC, and this was our first stay at the Hilton Hawaiian Village. I know the Lagoon Tower is supposed to one of the hardest locations to book within HGVC, I jumped online at exactly 9 months out and got the room and view I wanted. However our plans changed and I was worried about losing the ocean front view, but luckily I was able to change the reservation and got the same room and view.We had room 1467, which is right on the end with an unobstructed view of the Lagoon and ocean. I know some others have complained about maintenance issues, and the dated décor with the Lagoon Tower. However we were pleased with the décor, while maybe not super modern, I would call it classic. The furniture was comfortable enough. The master bedroom was good sized, but the second bedroom was rather cramped with two twin beds. It was just two of us traveling, so the small second bedroom was not really an issue.Being in the middle of Honolulu, we ate most of our meals out. I did however cook breakfast every morning, and enjoyed that on the Lanai reading and watching the waves. The lanai was too sunny for afternoon drinks, at least for me. But it was a great spot for watching the Friday Night Fireworks. We had one maintenance issue, with a shower valve not working right. I called guest services in the morning, and it had been fixed by the time we got back mid-afternoon.The entire Hilton Hawaiian Village complex is centrally located, it’s an easy walk to thee entire Waikiki area and beaches, which is great as renting a car and parking would be hassle in this area. My only complaint about the resort, and Waikiki in general is the crowds. Pretty much everywhere you go there are people. It was often challenging to find a chaise at the pool. I can’t fault the resort for that, but now realize that personally we prefer the less crowded islands.

From the bellhops and lobby greeters to front desk, we had great customer service. The rooms are in desperate need of renovation, although a display in the lobby says this is coming in Sept. 2015. Wifi was better than in most hotels. We were able to stream Netflix and connect our laptops to the TVs. We paid up for a 2BR premium unit which put us right on the lagoon overlooking the ocean and harbor. Unfortunately, we were on a lower floor (#6) and the noise from the pool and the public lagoon/beach was really loud. It was definitely worse on the weekend, including well into the night on Sunday. I would not choose to stay on this property again on a weekend. The pool was SUPER crowded, there were not enough chairs to accommodate guests. The main village pool wasn't any better. The weekdays were better, although the landscaping activity to groom the lagoon area each morning disturbed the peace of sitting on the lanai. Overall, until the Lagoon Tower upgrades its furnishings (my husband referred to the furniture as ""goodwill"" quality, as it was scratched, dented, had huge water stains, and the lamps were falling apart, etc.), I would choose a different property.

Hilton Hawaiian Village is massive, with many different buildings. The flavor is extremely international, as Honolulu - and particularly HGVC - seemingly serving as a gateway to the Far East (Japan and Korea). This was our second stay in the Kalia Tower, although well maintained, our 1BR Unit was a little smaller than expected, and only one bathroom was disappointing. You have to ask for things like luggage racks and enough pillows/hangers/towels/toiletries for a family of 4. Having free laundry machines on the floor worked well, although having it in the room as some units have would have been better. Kalia tower is far from the ocean and pool, although we had a nice ocean view. The small pool on the 4th floor is underwhelming.

We like to walk into Waikiki and the surrounding area - which is a big reason for staying in Waikiki. Kalia Tower was good for that, although the Village is at the outskirts of the Waikiki strip and you have to walk through/around a park which is somewhat inadvisable in the evening (per locals). Ocean is very calm and protected and it is easy to find a spot. No problem getting chairs at pools, but pools are nothing special. Didn't use lagoon (man made). Be forewarned that hotel restaurants are very very expensive. You are better off going off site. Hawaii is expensive, but the hotel pretty much adds 50% to 100%. Walk off property or - better yet - rent a car and enjoy Oahu's beaches, snorkeling and local food stops, especially the food trucks on the North Shore.","Short Hills, New Jersey","kennethl500</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Short Hills, New Jersey</strong>",2,5.0

Lagoon tower has ""cozy"" studios and 1-2-3 bedroom suites and is part of the Hilton Grand Vacations club. I was able to get a last minute deal for a ""studio"" on the penthouse level (room L2462). We are HGVC club members and our home resort is in Las Vegas and have stayed at this resort several times. On this trip there was no availability using our HGVC points plus and there is a 3-night min. stay on membership points. So I booked this from the Hilton HHonors website and this room literally popped up on my screen as I was looking for hotels. The room was small, ""cozy"", but functional with awesome views from lanai...this room is probably the 3rd bedroom from the suite next door since there is was an access door in our room (I believe the penthouse floor bedroom suites are 2 levels...living and dining areas on 1st level and bedrooms on second level). The bed was comfortable and big enough to sleep my 21 yr old son and myself. It has a microwave and refrigerator. Upon check-in (Lagoon and Grand Waikikian have separate check-in desk...less crowded) we just changed and headed to beach and ate at the Blue Water Shrimp at the resort (this replaced the ramen noodles place). My son and I met back up in the room to watch the fireworks and just chill on the lanai and planned our next day to Hanauma Bay and North Shore. Look for my review with room pics on the Hyatt Regency Waikiki resort and spa ONLY here at TripAdvisor coming shortly. For people who have never stayed at this resort and have read other reviews, negative or positive, all I can say is Waikiki Beach is a world renowned tourist destination so expect that there will be a lot of people...old, young, kids, etc. This is not a trendy hotel, it's a resort that has everything and you really don't need to leave other than to explore more of Oahu or find more shopping. This stretch of Waikiki beach area is quiet and has plenty of beach space to just chill as compared to other parts of Waikiki beach.Overall it was again....A GREAT weekend at HHV!",Illinois,"HawaiiMauLoa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Illinois</strong>",8,5.0

Rather pricey for dining (especially with the 3 boys) but lots of selections and safe to roam about on their own. Concierge (Julie) was extremely helpful in planning our activities/events for the week. Front desk staff very promptly addressed a couple of small issues that we had and went above and beyond to provide us with complimentary use of another room after we had checked out to clean up in before our flight home (didn't leave for the airport until the evening). Value of 2 bedroom suite was good, considering we would have paid at least the same for 2 separate hotel rooms anywhere else to accommodate our family with 4 separate beds. Only negative was the time share presentation which was a little aggressive towards the end, but we did receive two free luau tickets worth approx. $220 US.

Overall we had a wonderful time. We were fortunate to request and get one of the corner 2 bedroom units. These have 2 lanais (balconies), one by the kitchen/dining table and the other in the living room. They give the room a much more open and outdoorsy feel. The only downside was that we were on the 4th floor and were subject to a lot of noise from the traffic between the tower and parking structure and from staff tearing down tables, chairs, and stages from the many special events held on the 'garden lawn'. The cacophony would continue sometimes to 2-3:00am. If you plan on doing any kind of real cooking in the room I suggest you go to Wal-Mart and purchase a knife or two and a fry pan. The knives in the room were a joke. I was trying to make stir-fry and could not dice an onion without using the serrated knives like a saw. I requested another knife from housekeeping and the one they brought was worse than the ones already in the room. The 2 small fry pans were only big enough to fry a couple of eggs or 3 slices of SPAM at a time. Can you imagine trying to fry bacon for 6 people in a 6 inch fry pan? The HHV staff has always been fantastic. They go out of their way to make every guest feel special. Kudos to the Bell staff. Many times we would stop to drop off passengers and/or groceries.

The worst feature of the room is that it had a sofa bed, which was totally unnecessary, as the room was too small for it. The sofa blocked access to the only window that had a semi-decent view, and it blocked access to half of the (small) closet. Also, maid service is provided only twice a week.

If you take a cab or van shuttle make sure that they know the difference or you'll have a long walk with your luggage. Securing a 1 Bedroom Plus for 9 nights required booking 9 months in advance (as soon as you can if you don't own there), due to the popularity. As an owner of a week of Hilton's time-share, the best utilization of your points is to book the weekdays in the beginning and ends of your stay and the weekend in the middle, due to the amount of points required per day. The 1 bed+ is a suite with a full kitchen and, my understanding is, the earlier you book the higher you are placed on floors.

There are free washers and dryers on the floors and detergent in the units under the sink with the sponges, dishwasher and dishwashing liquids, etc. There are flat-screen TVs in each room and the living room has a PlayStation with 2 controllers and you get a free DVD rental card good for your entire stay. If you're on the Diamond Head side you'll hear music at night from either functions on the Great Lawn between buildings or from the band at the Tapas Room until 9:00 or 10:00 - can't be sure, I was out late most nights. In September 2015, the Lagoon Tower rooms will be undergoing major renovations as they have just modified the desks in the Lagoon lobby and are in the process of doing each of the 3 elevators, 2 were done when I left and the 3rd was almost complete.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Jeffrey H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",66,5.0

I hear my neighbors in the evening when dining. They weren't speaking loudly but I could hear their conversation when seated at the dining table. My concern is not listening to them but more-so them listening to my twin 4 year old girls playing and fighting. We tried our best to get the girls to pipe down so that our neighbors can enjoy their vacation .... my apologies to them!!My recommendation is to find a suite as high up on the tower as possible. I can't recommend or suggest anything on the thin walls .. but avoid staying beside suites with young kids like mine ... :-)The biggest complaint I have, which irks me dearly, are the sharing of elevators with cleaning and maintenance staff. There are only 3 elevators and we found ourselves having to wait because they were occupied by cleaning and maintenance carts. The elevators floors are damaged from their use .... and I am reminded of it every time I use it. They should be using the freight elevator !!!

Shaded areas by the pool are few and far between, but some of the more secluded pools were better and quieter. There is happy hour at one pool with discounted food and drinks. We had 2 double beds in a studio, and the kitchen was pretty cramped. The beds were fine in the middle but sagged a lot on the edges. They clean the rooms once per week, but you can always ask for more towels/supplies. The rest of our family was in a 1 BR which was very nice, like an 800 sq ft apartment. Some of them stayed at the hotel part of the resort (Ali'i Tower) for a few nights, and it was pretty nice, but no kitchen.

We have always loved the location and the rooms and looked forward to spending two weeks. This year we arrived in mid May and found everything to our liking in the room we had except for a sticking front door that didn't always close securely. This was mentioned to Maintenance, but the problem was not taken care of. In the middle of our second week, our room was burgled while we were on the lanai and some beach items were stolen. Either the door did not lock securely due to the sticking problem or someone used a card key to get in the room. Luckily our ID, money and jewelry were in the room safe. We immediately called Hilton security and they called the Honolulu police to investigate. A report was taken, but no suspects were identified and since there are no surveillance cameras in the hallways, elevators or stairwells there was no way to determine who may have burgled our room and there was little chance of solving the case. This invasion of our privacy so upset us that we cut our trip short by 4 days and returned home even though we love the Islands. I strongly recommend that the Management of the Lagoon Tower consider installing some security surveillance cameras to help ID burglers in the future because I am sure that there will be future burglaries. Although the Lagoon Tower is our home resort and we have always considered it the place that we want to stay when we go to Hawaii, we are now not sure if, or when, we will return. The burglary has destroyed a cherished remembrance of ours of Hawaii. I considered not writing this review, but decided to do it, because there is a security problem at the Lagoon and it needs to be addressed.","Seattle, Washington","2rjronster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",10,3.0

Rooms: lagoon tower was spacious however grand waikikian was considerably smaller and lacked the views the lagoon tower had. Although the grand waikian is a newer building with in room laundry we prefered lagoon tower for room size, view, and location in the resort. Amenities: pool area with slide was extremely crowded with not enough lounge chairs for guests and the pool itself was small considering that this is the pool that most families would be attracted to. When on vacation I dont mind paying a premium price for poolside lunches however most of the food (pronto pickle) was premade and not good. We are Marriott Vacation Club Owners and DVC Owners and we find that their poolside food is expensive but very good so we don't mind paying the extra. Most resort activities were extremely overpriced and if you just walked down the beach other resorts / beach services could be had for a considerably cheaper price. We did alot of sightseeing on this trip so several days were spent away from the resort and the one positive was coming home to a well appointed condo type room.

Loved that we could call guest services and they would reply to any and all needs. But tipping the delivery person each time we found something missing got annoying.

At night, with the light sparkling, the city was beautiful and we could sit on the lanai and watch the sunrise in paradise!!After reading a few other reviews regarding stays at the HHV in Aug. 2014, I'm surprised by the comments regarding the following: *Japanese overrunning the resort - while there WERE many Asians, I did not find that they were ""overtaking"" the resort as Pam S stated. Of course, I was in paradise and didn't mind sharing the experience with everyone!*Overcrowding in restaurants, pools and elevators - we never had to wait for an elevator for long and only once was the elevator so full we waited for a second one. Of course, we were in the Kalia Tower and not the Lagoon Tower so maybe that made a difference. We totally LOVED our experience with the Kalia Tower. I believe it had been remodeled recently and the Lagoon Tower is due for its facelift next year...Tapa Tower is going through theirs currently, I think. I could be wrong. Our pool, on the 4th floor, was not crowded, there were PLENTY of lounge chairs, and it was very clean. We ate at the Tropics 3 different days at different times and NEVER had to wait for a table. We ate outside next to the beach each time.*Check-in being slow - we arrived after 9pm and there wasn't much of a wait at all. We used their valet service and our bags were brought to our room within minutes. Our tower had its own check-in/check-out but we didn't know that until we checked in through the main lobby.We all agreed that we'd stay there again on a future visit and it was WELL worth the price paid. Having all those pools, the lagoon, the ocean, all the restaurants and 90+ stores to shop, all on the resort grounds, made for an amazing vacation. Additionally, all the places that are within a short walk...we went for breakfast at IHOP, Eggs & Things (twice) and one other place close by that was featured in Hawaii Five-0. We ate at the Tropics Bar & Grill 3 different times...I'm obsessed with their Kalua Pork Nachos...OMG they were so good. So good that we are planning on making them Labor Day weekend...we bought some Alaea sea salt, hickory liquid smoke and banana leaves. They'll never taste as good as they did while in Hawaii though.Friday night fireworks were a great way to start the weekend!

It is an oasis at the best location in Waikiki. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is comprised of multiple hotel towers and vacation suite towers that share several pools and spas. My kids like the salt water lagoon where they are able to SUP, kayak, or just lay in the sand. The rentals are a bit on the pricey side, but so is everything else in Hawaii. The hotel suites are comfortable for a family of four. We like having the two bedroom unit with two full bathrooms, a living room, and kitchen. It gives us the option of eating in for some meals. When we don't feel like cooking, there are multiple snack bars and restaurants right on property. A big plus for this hotel is that it is located walking distance to other Waikiki attractions and shopping. The two main drawbacks for this hotel is that it gets very crowded especially during holiday weeks and that the Lagoon tower elevators can be a bit slow accommodating the large crowds. For our family, that's a small price to pay for staying at such a great vacation club and location.","Reno, Nevada","94jenniferh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reno, Nevada</strong>",5,5.0

Our two-bedroom unit was nice clean and comfortable. I have no issues with the property itself. It is located on the beach and has a salt water lagoon which our kids enjoyed. The equipment rentals are pricy though.This part of the beach is not that nice. There are construction pebbles/ stones right on the water. The food is average, but you get a lots of variety. We ended up buying the groceries from ABC store which is located in the Village itself, and cooking our meals for some days.The check-in staff was not friendly but worked efficiently to check us in. The Concierge staff is however very PUSHY on getting you to attend their timeshare presentation. Their one and only aim is to get you to attend their presentation. They are not helpful at all for any other questions you might have.I also found the salt water lagoon very marshy and stinky. Expected it to be very clean, but it is not. There are other better located property on the beach, such as Surfrider, which you should consider seriously as it is located in the much nicer part of the beach. I had heard bad feedback about their Luau, so we did see that, instead went to a show in Maui which was much nicer. Luau here is very loud and is on top of the parking lot. You hear cacophony during Luau show, so I recommend leaving hotel property around that time and find something worthwhile to do outside.I may probably stay here again as we got to make use of our timeshare.","Woodstock, Maryland","Naturallycool</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woodstock, Maryland</strong>",25,3.0

As HGVC members we were able to use points to book a Premium 2-Bedroom Suite in the Lagoon Tower. This was our second stay. We had done this previously as well on a trip to the Big Island with a break in Honolulu on the way back. The check-in experience was decent and we were able to get to our room pretty quick.We were not disappointed. The unit was overlooking to lagoon and had full ocean front view with two balconies. We were on the 10th floor, and being just a few days after July 4th, had the front seat views of the Friday Fireworks in the evening. When we arrived we ate outdoors at the Tropics Bar with nice views of Waikiki Beach. Our kids are in their late teens and had plenty to do exploring the Hilton Hawaiian Village properties. My wife and daughter had spa treatments at the Mandara Spa, while my son and I rented an Ocean Kayak and got out into the Waikiki waters. It was all good. The Tropics bar is my new favorite.There are many pools to choose from, and quite a few restaurants. We had breakfast out on our balconies. Since I had a car I decided to go get Pizza for our Fireworks Friday night balcony viewing from Papa Johns that was about a mile away. Foodland is not too far either and became a place to pickup ready-made sandwiches for our hike up the Diamond Head Crater that we did the next day. My wife and daughter spent a few hours shopping in the retail area and my son got a small dancing hula girl dashboard ornament.We did the obligatory HGVC timeshare viewing. It was good and informative. We found out that certain less than popular time slots were being given $150 Hilton Hawaiian Dollars to be spent onsite. We took one of those and got refreshed on all there is to know about timeshares.We had dinner at the Bali Steak and Seafood Restaurant. While the food was good, the seating and table location etc. was less than ideal. the manager was not willing at all to consider re-seating us. Given the really high prices, I was hoping for a better experience.All in all a good visit.

Beautiful furniture all around.

I think with all the money they made selling all those units they could afford to offer cleaning every other day at least. The other thing, they shut down the store in the Lagoon tower and they have the store open in the Grand Waikikian, but talk about robbery, the prices there are ridicules.

The hotel staff were fabulous and very accommodating. The hotel grounds are beautiful, but we chose to stay here because of the pools it boasted. The pools really aren't THAT BIG and when they're full to the brim with other people you aren't that keen. The lagoon looks great in photos, and it was nice, but it's cold and kinda smells a bit weird. The ocean on Waikiki beach is AMAZINGGGGGG! Once we spent some time in the ocean, we didn't go back in the pool or lagoon again. The ocean is warmer than the pools or lagoon, and renting long boards etc down on Waikiki beach is cheaper than at the Hilton. It's a slight walk to get to the main shopping drag and other bars/restaurants. The Hilton is the closest hotel to Ala Moana mall though, a short walk. But you can get a bus from further down for $2.The Hilton is great for families, but next time we will be using air BNB or staying at one of the other many hotels closer to the main Waikiki beach.Make sure you make reservations at the restaurants, you can't just turn up....you'll be given a beeper and sent away for 40 minutes.....not just at Hilton Hawaiian Village, but most restaurants and bars in town. The hawaiian pizza at Round Table pizza is yummy....and The ABC stores on property are great for drinks and snacks.We use Air BNB to find our apartment for the second week, which we cannot speak highly enough of and definitely recommend to families who are seeking more than just a hotel room, for a fraction of the price of most hotel rooms in Waikiki.","Rome, Italy","worldwinelover22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rome, Italy</strong>",78,4.0

But there are caveats. What other people have said is accurate. It's a family resort. So, it's noisy. To be expected. Didn't bother us. Pools are busy. Hard to get pool chairs and no one is ""policing"" whether towels left on a chaise for 6 hours with no one in sight can really be reserved ???? All day? By the end we played the game the same way, and I'm sure, annoyed others. We did not eat at a hilton restaurant all week. Bought food from Foodland grocery and cooked. Also bought wine off-property. Groceries are expensive in oahu! What I experienced was a VIP package as a trial for full ownership. We were travelling with another family and wanted to be together as we have kids that can be left alone for awhile (girls have taken babysitting course) but not all night! And trying to reach a person beforehand to inquire about room selection: impossible. I understand why this is....to a point. But you know, if I am a paying guest at hilton, I know exactly what I'm getting and can request in advance certain things about room location. Not so with being an owner and to me, this seems backward. For holidays I want certain things guaranteed including type of room. Here you are only guaranteed the type of room if you buy this specific location, which is the most expensive. If a hgvc owner otherwise, it's dicey as to what you might get. That's the system so as long as this is not stressful, this might be a program to consider. But not for us at those prices! Would want to know I had my ocean view etc. this was a big reason that we did not buy after experiencing things, as we really felt that we could not deal with the lack of certainty. Anyhow many pluses to this kind of program and I can see how certain people may find this option appealing. And the property is well maintained, and kind of keeps you in, with all that there is to do. Friday night weekly fire works awesome. We did not do the hilton Luau..... Didn't feel we needed to as you can easily hear it all over the property!

Upon arrival, we were misdirected where to check in by several staff. Once we found the Lagoon Tower our request for a King bed in our Studio room was not honored which I had confirmed the day before. Mari was very nice and offered us an upgrade to a one bedroom in the Kalia Tower two days later. Once we saw our studio room which was more like a closet with a mini fridge and micro, I was extremely disappointed. No balcony, no dresser just a tv stand with 3 drawers and a very small closet. The room barely had room to put our two suitcases against a wall with space to walk around them. Every studio I've booked has had sitting area with kitchenette. This was a subpar standard room, NOT a studio. Needless to say it was a long two days waiting for the one bedroom to become available which was a vast improvement over the"" studio"". They nickel and dime you for items that are normally free at most resorts. $32 a day to rent an umbrella, $15 for a beach chair, $8 delivery fee for room service on top of the gratuity. No housekeeping unless you book for 7 days but can request fresh towels. The property is huge with extensive dining and shopping options, and a variety of swimming pools. The lagoon is a nice plus. Nightly live entertainment at the Tapa Lounge was pretty good with room for dancing. Fireworks show on Friday evening was a nice touch. Central location with easy city bus and shuttle access. Overall I would not stay here again or recommend to friends. I prefer a more intimate resort. Stayed here to meet with friends from the DC area and because it was available through our Fiesta Americana Vacation Club exchange. Our friends had a two bedroom suite with soiled questionable stains on a lot of the upholstered furnishing. Could really use some maintenace and deep cleaning. Wood funishings were dinged, scratched and stained. Really well worn and overdue for an update. Not up to Hilton standards compared to other Hilton properties I've stayed at.. Our friends were disappointed as well. One bedroom had twin beds which is not what they requested and shared a wall with the master. So much for romance. They will not be returning either. They have a rooftop luau daily that can be seen and heard from some of the rooms in the Lagoon Tower which got irritating after a day. One morning about 8am they had a group out on the lawn below our room with bullhorns and microphones conducting a team building/motivational excercise that lasted several hours. I felt locating them in that area was very inconsiderate to guests trying to sleep in.","San Diego, California","MsWiley57</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",13,3.0

It appears to be under new management and it is absolutely falling apart. They seem to be trying to make a buck by holding it out as a conference/party center while still treating it as a family resort. As any fool knows, those two things cannot go together. There were, literally, three parties in one week hosted right on the lawn, that lasted until ten pm, followed by loud clanking clean-up until the wee hours. Then various, incessant construction projects would begin at 8 am. Try that with your jet lagged children! Sound relaxing? Maintenance issues are atrocious: There are broken slides, gates and chairs at the pools, the grass on the lawn has been destroyed and patched in spots, the lagoon was half drained most of the time we were there, and even many of the plants and flowers are gone (as are the macaws and most penguins). Much of this is due to the new overcrowding, I assume, including the fact that sunbathing conference nerds now race down to put towels and magazines on chaise lounges at 8 am to save them for the day. They may not show up for hours, but they've saved all the seats for later. No class. Furthermore, every door latch in our rooms was broken, as were some appliances. Service has gone downhill just as badly. Before arriving I called the concierge to ask for help with future dinner reservations - she offered to look on Open Table for me, but said I could just do it myself as well. Concierges at better resorts have bookings. We arrived at nearly 1 am to find one man at the check-in counter for the entire vacations resort, with no bellmen and no valets. We took our own bags up rather than waiting... and after waiting twenty minutes for a valet to show up I finally told him I was going to my room. He told me I could not leave, I had to be there to take my half of the ticket or they'd have a hard time finding my car in the morning, and asked me to keep waiting for a valet for who knows how long. I offered him plenty of solutions - put the ticket stub in an envelope with my name and room number, have it sent to my room when the valet finally arrives, leave it with the resort manager or concierge - I didn't care. It's just a ticket. He kept saying no, so I left anyway. Lo and behold they had my ticket in the morning, no sweat. I was the wrong tier room and was told there was nothing they could do to fix it. They attempted to charge me parking for days we weren't even there, etc. It's hard to imagine how this could be less relaxing.

Have wanted to stay at Hilton Hawaiian Village since first seeing it more than 10 years ago. Booked a room at the resort and upgraded it to a one bedroom condo for a week. We were put in the Grand Waikikian which is part of the Hilton Grand Vacations Suites.We were given the traditional Hawaiian flower lei greeting at reception. Check in was fast and easy. Hilton has an arrangement with Charley's Taxi so it was a $29.00 flat rate from the airport. The condo was clean, spacious, with a kitchen, washer and dryer. Upon arrival we were told which day housekeeping would come into the condo. I liked not having to get out of the room everyday for housekeeping. Additional housekeeping was available with a phone call if needed. Liked being able to have breakfast in the condo and snacks in the kitchen.Only negative thing I have to say about the condo was that the pillows were absolutely the worst I have ever had in any hotel. They were flat beyond saving. Asked for pillows that had some loft to them and were told there weren't any. Next time I'll try to bring my own pillow.Did not rent a car. Parking rates are very high at the resort. Public transportation was a bargain and we were able to go where we wanted on The Bus.There is enough to do at Hilton Hawaiian Village that you don't even have to leave the resort.We took a sunset cocktail cruise on the Spirit of Aloha catamaran. The crew was great and they did not spare the alcohol in the drinks.We liked the resort and our stay so much that we hope to go back before the end of the year.

I had read a lot of reviews before booking our vacation destination and have to say I was not disappointed we certainly enjoyed our stay here. There were a lot of people but it was not bad like people say, your in Waikiki and there is plenty of sand an ocean for everyone. 1. Stayed in one bedroom in Kalia tower, all towers are short walk to beach and lagoon, was very clean and had full kitchen, stove, microwave, fridge, dining table, our girls slept on pull out sofa bed, not very comfy but adequate for a 3 and 5 year old but you would not want to sleep on it if your an adult. We slept in the king bed in bedroom so nice to have separate sleeping areas with kids! If you have family recommend staying in one or 2 bedroom suites, 1 bedroom suite was perfect for us as we need 2 separate rooms for sleeping plus there is more space/privacy.TVs and blu ray players (PS3) are in both rooms, so we brought some of our own mobile to watch, the tv in bedroom is a little small but we didn't really use it. TV in lounge is bigger and the free DVDs in the foyer is awesome, latest releases, no charge and loads to choose from.Loads of drawer space and hangers on closet as well as a good size safe. The laundry is not in room but in same floor so is close and good to be able to wash and dry clothes there so we were able to bring less luggage. The Kalia tower has its own fitness center, pool and hot tub on 4th floor, I believe all the towers do, so this is great. It also has a day spa that we did not use on this trip.2. Staff extremely friendly, helpful and even got an early check in, our room was well cleaned every day (they even put the girls soft toys in the beds for them) we were really treated like royalty and loved the amazing staff there and the beautiful clean rooms.3. Ala moana mall is close and has great shopping with all the major brands represented (girls love the Disney store) recommend stocking up with food form food land there as resort prices for food are pricey but there are plenty of great places to eat and there are also abc convenience stores everywhere, we had breakfast in our room and then ate lunch in resort and had dinner in room so was a great balance of some nice resort eating as well as dining in our own room making full use of kitchen etc...Parking is pricey, like $30 a day, recommend valet as is only a bit more, self parking I think is $27 a day. Valet is great and worth every penny, your in Waikiki so parking is premium and you just have to expect that and factor it in.4. Beach was great, crowded but still plenty of room to relax on the sand, everyone complaining about beach chairs and umbrellas, just buy them at abc for a few bucks and leave there, much easier and cheaper, we did that for the pool inflatables as well as sand buckets the girls loved playing with all these, when you leave pass them on to another family. the lagoon was great as well, not quite as warm as the beach which was quite warm and the best place to swim for that reason.5. This brings us to the pools, they are cold, and this is the only reason I did not give 5 stars, my girls were shivering in Hawaii! Pool temp is low 70s for sure, for me this is bad, it was the same last few times we were here as well, this is definitely an issue for us as it means the pools and water slides are not a lot of fun and only option for swimming is the beach. My 5 year old braved the water slides for about 6 rides but was shivering and lips were turning blue, I literally had to hug her in line to keep her warm, this should not be the case, the water slides are a great feature but who wants to land in cold water and then stand in line shivering? My 3 year old landed in cold water and it shocked her so she never wanted to go back in, was a shame as she was tall enough for slides so was excited until she landed I the cold water.Overall I might stay here again, we did visit the Disney resort and the pools were beautiful and warm so it is certainly factor in our future decision making, but it did not spoil our time as the girls love the beach so much so although was a shame not to spend more time in the pools we all did have a great time.

Once you check in free orchid lei and macadamia nut lei for guys, but you have to ask the lady to lei you. She is not attentive as to who are checking in so you have to physically go infront of her and ask her for a lei. It's one of those Hawaii vacation that you really want to experience, to get lei'd. So they need to have some kind of communication from the desk to alert the lady, so each and everyone that checks in get a lei. For me that's very important because it is a symbol of ""welcome to Hawai'i"" and your vacation starts now feel. There were 2 adults and 2 kids so we opted for 1 bedroom with a King size bed for me and my husband and a pullout sofa bed for the kids which they love becuase they can watch tv as late as they wanted. The rooms in the Lagoon is more spacious than the Grand Waikikian. Eventhough the decor and appliances are newer and the washing machine is in the room at the Grand Waikikian my whole family would rather stay in The Lagoon (19th floor). When you down on the first floor, few more steps and you are already at the Lagoon, the beach and the swimming pool. At The Grand Waikikian eventhough you walk inside the building it is still a walk. The Village has restaurants, shopping area, ABC store (a very convienient store that has almost everything you need) and a rent a car place (National) which the cars are parked at the Hilton parking building. We rented a car and drove around the Island and stopped by at Walmart to buy food to cook which saved us a lot of money. Both rooms are equiped with everything you need, including a rice cooker, sponge and a dishwashing soap and laundry detergent. We would eat at the balcony and watch the beautiful sunrise and sunset when we were at The Lagoon. The City View is not that appealing at all, so spend a little more for an ocean view. My kids love the gated pool with the slides and at night the pool is heated which is awesome. I don't suggest going to the main pool which is not gated, eventhough it is bigger it is crowded and I smell pee everywhere becuase that's where all the ""hotel guests"" are staying and anybody who wants to use the pool. They give you an orange card to exchange for beach towel. The only bad part is that they did not explain to us that when you are done with the beach towel to exchange it to get your card back for a new towel the next time you go back in the pool, and to return those orange card when you check out. Upon check in you also get a card to rent free movies (great selection) which is great at night.The check out time is 10am and check in is at 4pm, they have a family lounge at the 8th floor to wait for your room until it is available. When it was time for us to change building I thought we had to wait for our room but surprisingly they were already ready and we did not have to wait at all which is great.At night if we open our balcony we can watch the Luau from the top of the Hilton parking lot. The only bad part is I hated the pillow and the bed for some reason everytime I wake up my back hurts. The blanket at The Lagoon is so thick, its nice the first hour but when I woke up I was sweating. My husband and my kids did not have a problem so I ended up sleeping on the pullout sofa bed. Overall so much fun but if we go back we will definitely pick The Lagoon with Ocean View.","San Diego, California","twinstars143</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",15,4.0

Partial ocean view 2bedroom. Agree with other recent reviewer. Room is a little worn for having been ""recently renovated"". Kinda wish I had ponied up for a unit in the Grand Waikikian. Also, previous tenant left crab and God knows what else in the drain which created a horrible smell. Maintenance came and corrected right away. Resort was great.

Some doors were chipped, baseboards need painting and carpet needed cleaning or replaced, furniture needed cleaning. I think just over all the room needed a face lift. It was not up to my expectation of a Hilton brand. We stay at the Hilton Grand Vacation in Las Vegas, on the Big Island and Florida and they are always in excellent shape. Enough about the room. The customer service here is like I expect of a Hilton Brand. It is top notch. Everyone is very helpful and nice. ",,RiverThamesTraveler,30,3.0

The renovated units are much improved and spacious. The living room and eating area is spacious and so is the bedroom. I like the colour scheme. There are a few issues that management have overlooked. For example, very obvious paint chips on walls and corners, very cheap utensils and no can opener. I had to called front desk twice to request a can opener. The front lobby washroom is below a two star restaurant standard.Nevertheless, my spouse and I had a good visit and the concierge was very helpful with tour highlights and coupon books.","Abbotsford, Canada","G H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abbotsford, Canada</strong>",31,4.0

Mostly a very good impression.On the 2nd morning, we had been attacked by an infestation of termites. They were literally crawling all over the guest bathroom - in the sink, the tub, over the light fixtures and the counter. They were crawling their nasty little bodies into our travel kits as they hoped for a journey back to the mainland. All together distasteful.Upon complaint, management came in and sprayed poison (while we were in occupancy!) into the bathroom. This helped for approximately 30 minutes, and then the insects reappeared. On further complaint, hotel management agreed to move us.The second unit, 2365, had no such infestation. Unfortunately, it had a totally outdated air conditioning system (the same as the first unit) that had to run constantly in order to cool down the bedrooms (while the main room was freezing cold). The thermostats are old and outdated and could not be regulated to shut the A/C off and on even if a proper temperature was reached. To maintain coolness, you had to run the A/C and fan 24/7.To add to this, we noted huge amounts of mold visible in the vents. One person in our party (me) became physically sick day in and day out. We didn't put the ""mold"" together with the ""sick"" until the last day, when we were leaving. This could be coincidence - there's no way I can prove that the mold was the cause of my illness, but it's highly suspicious.Management never followed up with us to inquire if our new accommodations were satisfactory or if we were now happy. They never offered any compensation for the discomfort of the insects or the inconvenience of moving all of our goods. (We were using the parking valet - a simple gesture would have been to ""comp"" this service and it would have cost the hotel nothing.)This hotel is resting on its laurels and it appears to not much care as to the overall satisfaction of its guests. After many (many!) trips to this facility, I will never stay there again, although I will give the newer sister property, Grand Waikikian a chance to fulfill the empty promises offered at Lagoon Tower.","Palm Springs, California","MikePsp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palm Springs, California</strong>",27,2.0
