Like most properties in Waikiki, they charge a resort fee and have a valet charge that is quite high. The hotel is a good deal if you want to be right on the beach or close to the zoo and Diamond head. If not, I would spend a little bit more and stay at the other end of Waikiki. Valet staff were friendly and helpful. Rest of staff was just okay. They were still semi-friendly, but not above and beyond like you’re used to in Hawaii.

It's dishonest to sell one thing and deliver another. The pool offered a block away at The Aston was completely shaded &UNUSABLE until 2 pm. Nothing offered to compensate nor any discount offered.

My wife is handicapped so it actually worked out better for us. Just a little on the small side. But we slept great. bed was one of the best we had slept in even compared to more expensive hotels. And the view was a million dollars. The staff all of them went above. The construction didn't bother us. But know that going in. THe pool was closed during our stay.

When I arrived, management ""apologized"" but would not discount my rate. The rate was not what I bargained for. I was very surprised that no consideration would be given even though we stay at the hotel almost every year and have been for almost 30 years.

However, I didn't hear any noises from my room so it didn't affect me too much. The only inconvenience is that their pool is out of order during this time as well but they do allow you to use their sister property's pool next door. The hotel is perfectly situated facing both the Zoo/Diamond Head and the Beach/Ocean so depending what room you get, you will be facing either or. For my room, I had a view of both which was amazing! The rooms are a bit tight and compact but they have everything you need. The King bed has nightstands on both sides which have OUTLETS in the lamps (super important for a business traveler like me)! There is a small desk in front of the bed (where the tv is mounted to the wall so unfortunately you cannot watch TV and do work at the same time) and you have your closet, restroom, fridge/coffee station right when you walk in from the entrance. I appreciated having a mini-fridge to keep my drinks cool during the day. The balcony is nice and spacious to relax on if you'd like. I was able to take some great pictures from my balcony during my stay.On the 3rd floor, they have a microwave if you want to heat up any of the food you keep in the fridge. Also, they have reef-safe sunblock and aloe vera for you. There is a charge for parking (they only have Valet) so if you only plan to stay in Waikiki Beach area, you don't need to rent a car. You are literally at one end of Waikiki Beach and you can walk to the other end if you'd like within 20-30 minutes. It is also nearby a public bus stop if you want to head out to different parts of town (downtown honolulu, north shore, etc.) without having to rent a car. Overall, I think it's a wonderful property right on the beach.

I called to the front desk to ask about this and they said it was true. I was very frustrated. They indicated we would have access to the pool at a neighboring building. I asked why this was not told to me when I checked in on Friday. The “supervisor” at the front desk indicated they had posted signs in the elevators. I asked to talk with the manager. He indicated he was the person in charge for Sunday and the manager would call me on Monday.I checked the elevator for the sign and it indicated the bathroom on the third floor was going to be closed. No mention in the announcement about the pool being closed. I contacted my travel service that I booked the room through, they spoke with the hotel and were told the only thing they would do was allow me to leave by noon the next day and they would not charge me the cancelation fee. So we decided to stay. I was very disappointed the next day when I went over to the pool and there was no sun on the pool deck this time of year until about 2 PM. One of my main reasons for staying at the Park shore has been the pool. The manager never contacted me and I decided to not let it ruin my entire vacation. When I checked out today Feb 16, I was still charged the resort fee even though the pool area was closed. If you have plans to go here between now and April 2020 and are looking forward to the pool, make sure to ask about it and find a different hotel if it’s not available.

It was tucked into an inside corner of the building so the ocean view and diamond head views were partially obscured by the building's walls.Room smelled musty and felt damp the whole time. The a/c felt like it was a swamp cooler so while the room did cool down, it felt very clammy and damp. On Day three the A/C did not work well enough to get the room below 70 degrees, despite building maintenance's efforts, and so we had to have a room fan.Building power went out in the middle of Day 2 for 90 minutes so no a/c or lights, and down to 1 elevator we were asked to not use.LuLu's servings and service (possibly they have nothing to do with the hotel) was bad, slow and indifferent.

The Park Shore was a little less pricey than the others we had stayed in previously. We knew nothing about it except for reviews and research as we usually do. Being on the lively and much desired Waikiki Beach location in Kalakaua Avenue helped us make the decision. The Hotel is situated opposite The Honolulu Zoo. In fact, if you are in a certain spot, you can hear the monkeys chattering together. After a 10 hour flight from Australia, it was a pleasant surprise to find our room ready at 6:30 am! when we arrived. After an initial slight issue with our cards, all was well to proceed to our Ocean View room, with the added addition of Diamond Head, beyond the Zoo. There is a resort fee payable of $39 per night extra. If you are from Australia, don't forget to add tax! Our room was pleasant if basic, with the usual facilities. Hawaiian Paradise coffee in a pouch which makes two and a half cups each day and was disappointingly luke warm. No milk is supplied which is fine because there is an ABC store right through the lobby and a Starbucks outside the front door. The ABC shops cater for everything. We were fortunate to obtain a south facing room on the 8th floor as the rooms facing the beach (west) directly had the full force of afternoon sun. The Hotel has a rooftop pool. It was relatively quiet as the pool closed reasonably early and unlike other Hotels, there was no bulk air conditioner noise to keep us awake so we slept well here. We liked the Hotel. The staff were pleasant and accommodating. The foyer has rocking chairs facing the street which guests seemed to appreciate. There is Lulu's restaurant upstairs where we spent our mutual birthdays, sipping on Pina Coladas and a Mai Tai. Ah the scent of plumeria wafting inside and the sound of waves crashing to shore.

The hotel lobby was not impressive but the staff were friendly and quickly got us checked in, including offering us free bottles of water.When we got out of the elevator on the 14th floor the hallway was dark, hot, and a little grimy. We were still optimistic that money had been spent on the rooms instead of the hallways. Unfortunately we were wrong.The room was an extreme let down. It was dark and also grimy, with extremely dirty curtains. The bathroom was small and was not very nice. There were two ceiling tiles in the entrance to the room that were slightly open, exposing the duct work above. When we opened the curtains, we discovered that we could only see Diamond Head from our ""Diamond Head view suite"", if we stood on the farthest side of our balcony on our tip toes.We decided to tough it out, stay one night, and see how it went. However, we quickly discovered (as many other people on here also have) that the a/c did not work at all. It blew out air, but the room stayed between 74-76 degrees the entire time we were there. I went down and talked to the front desk, who sent up a maintenance worker. He showed me how to turn the a/c on and off again, and then left. The front desk also sent up a fan (the speed with which they offered this solution made it clear they'd heard this complaint before) which we didn't use because it was so dirty.We stayed one night and then went down to the front desk and asked about the cancellation policy. The staff were very nice and since we'd already paid for one night, we could leave without any other costs.Would not recommend this hotel to anyone.","Seattle, Washington","kas7686</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",9,2.0

But as time went on, their rates became more acceptable. So I gave them another chance earlier this month (Sept. 14-23, 2019). Our first room, Ocean View, was nice but the A/C just couldn't keep the room cool. So the next morning we upgraded and moved to an Ocean Front room with spectacular views. But even with the A/C set to 65 we could not get the room cool enough to enjoy the room during the day. But by the time we were ready to turn in, the room was close to acceptable for sleeping. I know that Hawaii was having record heat but that is why a working A/C in necessary. I ran into a woman from Australia in the elevator and she said that she didn't think any of the rooms on the 17th floor had working A/C. And to add to our discomfort, this Ocean Front room, #1807 had a teeny bathroom with only a pedestal sink -- with almost no space for cosmetics and toiletries. Also, there is a huge daily resort fee that covered almost nothing of interest -- not even a newspaper! On our way out, the bellman told us, when we complained, that most of the room's A/Cs didn't work well and that there were only two options left: A major remodel or to tear it down and build a new hotel on this prime site. Plus the hotel changed hands recently and is no longer run by Aqua. Also, the help, all pleasant, mostly worked to hide the poor A/Cs in the rooms. Sad.

Their location is one of the best, because it’s located right across the road from the beach and is the very last hotel on the Waikiki Beach strip, which in turn makes them a very quiet hotel, away from the noise of the strip. The hotel is just across the road from the Zoo and Queen Kapiolani Park, so in the early morning hours the birds and singing and your views are countless trees, Diamond Head and the ocean. The front desk staff is very pleasant and helpful and the beds are quite comfortable. The lobby is open air and the rooms are small, but clean and have very good air conditioning. While the hotel is a little dated, they still offer an pretty acceptable product. About a year ago the hotel became part of the Aston hotel group, so they’ve cut back on lobby and room amenities and have instituted a resort levy (as most Hawaii hotels have) at a staggering $39 per person, per day a day. This allows you free internet, free local and long distance calls (on your iPhone its also provides you free domestic calls back to the mainland), the use of a beach chair and towel, a packet of free coffee to use in your room coffeemaker and free sun tan lotion - all for only $39 each!. Nevertheless, in spite of the resort levy, you’ll be hard pressed not to find similar resort fee charges elsewhere. So, in spite of their shortcomings, I have to recommend this hotel because of their great location and relatively affordable rates compared to other Waikiki hotels and would recommend this place to family and friends.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","RickFLL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",74,4.0

I have traveled to Hawaii at least once a year for 15 years but this was my first stay at this hotel. I agree with other reviewers that the location is great, not just because it is near so many restaurants and close to the beach. It is the last property before a park and zoo so there are no buildings on one side to disrupt the view or cast a blanket of shade on the pool (in contrast, for example, to the Outrigger Reef). Also, it is across from arguably the best part of the beach. Due to erosion some of the high-end hotels (e.g., Sheraton) in the center of Waikiki have virtually no beach. Despite the wonderful location, this hotel may not appeal to people who are used to a five star resort where everything is shinny and modern and exclusive. In addition, it may not meet the expectations of kids who are used to big pools with slides and water falls (good luck finding one of those in Waikiki, the only pool that comes close is at the Hilton Hawaiian Village). This hotel is more of a place for a family or couple on a budget, or someone traveling alone who wants some down time in a safe location. The rooms are small but adequate. The AC works well. The shower works well. There is a fridge and a drip coffee maker (just one small pack of coffee, sugar and powered whitener daily but there is a Starbucks and another coffee shop right outside the hotel). The bed is comfortable but lacks the poofy duvets that you would find in a higher-end hotel. More than half the rooms have beautiful ocean views. Those on the park/zoo side have great views (my pic was taken from the 8th floor, farthest room from the beach and closest to the elevator—I paid for a “standard” room). Rooms on the other side of the building are near the Aston Waikiki and some look like they catch a much narrower angle of the ocean. (The Aston was another property I considered so I checked it out. Will make comparisons below). The pool at the Park Shore is usually quiet and the pool area is well maintained. There is no restaurant to draw a crowd (Lulu’s is on the street level) and the hotel does not monitor bringing in food or drinks. Consequently, people bring their own food/drinks and no one seems to take advantage of that by leaving a mess or getting drunk. There are vending machines, sun screen dispensers, and a microwave to use in a small room accessible from the pool deck. An ABC store is downstairs accessible through the hotel lobby with lots of cold drinks, salads, snacks. From the pool you can see the ocean. This is rare in Waikiki. Also, though the pool looks relatively small, it is not particularly small by Waikiki standards. Those who prefer the beach can borrow small folding chairs to carry across the street. The beach is beautiful and the surf is safe. The chairs are not very comfortable, however, and I don’t think anyone over 200 pounds could fit in them. (I strongly encourage the hotel to purchase better beach chairs. The ones from the Queen Hotel two properties behind the Park Shore look better, but I’m glad I’d didn’t stay at the Queen because the location isn’t nearly as nice as you have to go by some sketchy side streets to get there). Now to compare the Park Shore with the Aston next door. Both hotels are very open air, so no AC in the lobby or halls (not unusual in Hawaii). The Aston has a restaurant and also a take-out counter by the pool, but the Aston’s pool is much busier and there is very little view of the ocean pool-side. The public can walk right in to the Aston (as I did) to access the restaurant (Tikis) and enjoy the view. The amount of people around the Aston pool and the ease of buying food/drinks probably appeals to some more than the quiet of the Park Shore, assuming they can find a lounge chair at the Aston. No need to save chairs at the Park Shore. The Aston looks like it offers slightly more rooms with views, but with buildings on both sides their pool is shaded longer and at least some rooms’ views toward Diamond Head are obstructed by the Park Shore. Note the sidewalk outside the Aston and Park Shore is under construction, but there is minimal noise from that. Most of the noise in the area is traffic and easily ignored at night with the patio door shut and the AC going. I will definitely return to the Park Shore. It is relaxing and convenient and an excellent price for the location. ","North Vancouver, Canada","K D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Vancouver, Canada</strong>",9,5.0

If Park Shore charged $99/night I might put up with it. Since it doesnt, pay more and stay at a higher end place, if you like super clean and modern. I checked out 20 minutes after I checked in, went to the Hyatt Centruc, and felt safe and clean in my room each night. If hotel age and cleanliness are a concern, pay more to stay elsewhere.

This is a poorly renovated hotel that suffers from cut corners and style over substance. Let’s start with the absolute worst: faulty fire alarms. I’m writing this after being awoken 4 times by the very intrusive alarm sounds. After requesting further information, it was blamed on the rainy weather and “open lobby”. That is a serious design flaw in a tropical region. The humid rainy weather set off your alarm? The horrible design choice of an open lobby, affects your alarm system? What on earth?? Additionally, this is a known issue. I found reviews going back at least one year with this same faulty alarm. How has this not been addressed yet???If there is one thing a hotel should provide, it should be secure sleeping arrangements! I am paying to sleep here and I will be compensated for my lost services. The open design issue contributes to the roach problem (which was dismissed as normal for an island). It is a huge security risk as well! Anyone can walk in and interact with our rooms. Unacceptable. I am livid. This will be reported to all regulatory bodies in the area.

The disappointing part was that on check-in, the hotel would not honor the stated parking fee (half what they charged us) on our reservation. They did honor the amenities fee stated but that difference wasn’t much. In addition, we had to ask for the complimentary beach bags listed on the amenities list (we saw this the next day) and the managers reception on the hotel video loop on the TV no longer exists, nor is the hotel guest discount at the neighboring restaurant (also on the video) honored any longer.

Waikiki is expensive with many hotels in the moderate price bracket, receiving very mixed reviews. We therefore took a long time trying to find a hotel with good reviews within our budget. I usually book through one of the well known booking companies as they are usually cheaper, however, when I looked on the Park Shore website they were doing an advanced purchase deal. This was reasonably good value in an expensive location. The hotel is not perfect but, it is at the lower, quieter end of Waikiki beach, near the zoo, so you have green open spaces, the beach across the road (amazing at sunset!) a fantastic view of Diamond Head, sometimes with rainbow, a basic but clean room, very friendly, helpful, reception and an ABC store leading from the lobby area, which is great for provisions. Most hotels in Waikiki (especially near the seafront) seem to charge the dreaded amenity fee, which seems to have been increased following a change of ownership/management at Park Shore. This is a shame as it seems to have effected the previously good reviews, as guests were not made aware of this until they came to check-in. I hope that when this is all straightened out the Park Shore will once again be regarded as a good/reasonably good value hotel (in Waikiki).

I requested and was given a quiet room on a high floor. The advantages of this place include: it’s one of the cheapest hotels in Waikiki across the street from the beach; swimming pool has a partial view of the beach; room was quiet, clean, smelled good, and was in excellent condition; bed was clean and comfortable; pleasant open-air lobby with high ceiling; and reasonably fast elevators (when not interrupted by intermediate stops). There is an ABC Store open 24/7 in front, with a back door linking directly to the hotel lobby. Now for the disadvantages, which is what we all read TripAdvisor for. The single biggest one is the raise in the resort fee to $39 after my booking with no concomitant increase in amenities to compensate. I would have given this place a rating of five but for that one issue. The resort fee was already way too high at $25 because this place does not have free newspapers, a gym, complimentary continental breakfast, free parking, or all the other usual perks that hoteliers usually deploy to justify such fees. Fortunately, I already have a 24 Hour Fitness nationwide subscription and was able to stay fit during my vacation at one of their Honolulu gyms. However, I can see how people without that option would be really annoyed.The lobby is very nice, but upstairs, the hallways are dimly lit and kind of depressing. The room was really tiny. As a solo traveler, I was fine, but a family would find it to be horribly cramped.I asked for a quiet room and I was happy to get a very quiet room facing away from the street, but with not much of a view because I was facing north towards another hotel (the Aston). But I can see how people facing the beach or the park would not be happy because of the heavy bus traffic on Kalākaua and Kapahulu Avenues. When I was swimming in the third floor pool, I could hear the buses and traffic going by below. I finally understand now why the hotels half a mile north are so much more expensive—they’re next to all the best shopping and restaurants. If you stay farther away, then it’s a long walk, or you have to put up with riding TheBus. At least Google Maps is very reliable at predicting bus arrival times. It’s a long walk to board TheBus on Kuhio or Kapahulu Avenues, but when coming back, several routes literally stop in front of the Park Shore. Overall, I liked this place and would definitely consider staying here again when I return to Waikiki another decade from now. But keep that resort fee in mind when shopping around.

There is a Starbucks within a 1 minute walk of the hotel. And there is an ABC store right in the lobby where you can buy everything from food, drinks, shampoo, sunblock and souvenirs. If you are going to the beach, they have beach chairs, beach mats and beach floats that you can borrow free of charge. The pool area was nice. There are not a lot of chairs at the pool and of course there were the rude people who put towels on the chairs to reserve them even though they weren’t actually at the pool. The room itself was bigger than we had expected. (I had read other reviews that said the rooms were tiny, so I was expecting really small, but it was a normal hotel room size.) We had issues with our refrigerator when we first arrived, but someone came up right away and got it working. We needed extra pillows and towels during our stay and someone came up to our room right away to give us what we needed. Our balcony was fabulous and we used it every minute we could to enjoy the view.There were a couple of down sides. First is the street noise. The hotel is at a busy intersection which includes a bus stop. You constantly heard traffic noise in your room even with the doors closed. Second, the balcony does not have a lot of privacy. You can almost shake hands with other neighbors that are out on their balconies. Third, is the resort fee. When we booked the room, the resort fee was $25 per night. Sometime after we booked the hotel it got new owners and they changed the resort fee to $39 per night. When we checked in they wanted to charge us $39 a night. After arguing with the clerk for awhile he got a manager who changed the fee back to $25. The night before we were to check we got a printout of our bill and it said $25. The morning of our checkout they changed the fee back to $39. Once again we had to fight about the fee and they insisted they were going to charge us the $39 even though we had a printout that showed $25. Eventually they changed it back to $25 but I think only because we were making a big scene in a very crowded lobby.Overall we were impressed with the quality of the hotel even though it was reserved at a lower price point.","Mokena, Illinois","382lyndaa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mokena, Illinois</strong>",19,5.0

Been wanting to come back to Hawaii but we decided to explore the world and decided to only come back to Hawaii for our 10th anniversary. And we did. Booked a good deal online for an Oceanfront room for 4 nights. We explored the other islands before Oahu. We arrived at about 11am and I was glad we could check in. On the form I noticed I was assigned room 1507 but got 707 instead. I assumed that it's because I was checking in early thus another room was assigned. As long as the room was Oceanfront, am good. Check in was average. Was done by a rather new staff. No information given about hotel facilities, what the resort fees cover. I had to look for the info in the room and not sure what the exclusive bag is but I didn't get it.The Ocean front room we got was spacious and the balcony faced Diamond Head, Waikiki and the ocean. Views were amazing! Higher floor would be even nicer. When I went into the bathroom, I realised it was a bathroom with handicap facilities. I have stayed in such rooms before usually just for a night for work. Didn't really mind.However, I realised the bathroom doesn't work when there were two of us. Water from the shower was flowing everywhere and made the toilet wet. The toilet has a sink with no space except for toothbrushes. After the first shower when we checked in, I wanted to change room especially since we were staying for 4 nights but the hotel was full. Enquired with staff again the next day but we were told it was a full house all the way.We had to shower and at the same time prevent water from seeping out but was unsuccessful. The bathroom mat was wet and squishy all the time and it's inconvenient to get it changed everytime. Toilet was wet all the time. At one point, I nearly slipped while carrying the pot of coffee to throw into the sink. The shower curtain should be placed further inwards to prevent water from water flowing down from the curtains onto the floor. My booking was not for a handicap facility room which I am very sure of. Some hotels do sell these rooms and indicate while booking. However, it would be good for staff to inform guests about the room.Staff and service wise, felt it was average. Coming from Asia where service is more formal, always felt the Americans were very friendly and chatty with their service, didn't feel so at the Park Shore. Walking from the lift to the exit or vice versa, you won't meet any staff up close at all because the reception and bell desk are right at the corner, and you will tend to cut across the lobby.However, we still did enjoy our stay at the Park Shore despite the wet toilet. We loved that our room was very private, has a large balcony that faces Diamond Head and the ocean and another window that faces the ocean. We saw the sunset every evening and even a rainbow after it rained!

Friendly staff & amazing location. I gotta say I've stayed at many hotels in my life and the Park Shore's staff are definitely one of the nicest I've encountered. Roxy and Michelle were a delight, and a gentleman with a Hawaiian name too. I can't remember his name. However, the staff can only do so much to contribute to the overall experience of a vacation. Upon arrival I was unwillingly charged an insane amount for my amenity fee and vallet parking. When I booked, my confirmation stated a $25 amenity fee and $28 vallet parking. When I checked in however the agent explained to me that the hotel had recently gone under new management and they would not be honoring my set agreement. Now I know the staff is just doing their job, but I thought that was a real shady way of running a business. When I agreed to the rate at the time of booking I expect to be paying that same amount when I arrive. Not honoring that gave me the impression that all the hotel cares about is making money. Not a very good first impression for a lot of guest I would imagine. The amenities were lackluster at best and in my opinion did not validate a $39 extra fee a night. The hotel is in a great location for sure, but if you carbon dated the place I'm pretty sure it would put this hotel at 60+ years of age. And it shows. You would think with all money they we're squeezing out of guests they would use some of that to spruce the place up. It's in need of major revitalization. Housekeepers were surprisingly friendly, when they were around. I was constantly having to call down to get my room cleaned. Every time I did I was asked if I had left my ""do not disturb"" sign on to which I responded no. According to the front desk agent I'm supposed to get DAILY room cleaning service which clearly did not happen for my room. Maybe my Harry Potter cloaking spell finally kicked in and the maid skipped it who knows. Check out was interesting, left around 7am only to be greeted by a Beyonce concert worthy line. I felt bad for the guy working the front by himself. Never have I been to a hotel where they scheduled one staff member during peak operation hours. Maybe someone called in sick, but the front desk seemed to be understaffed every day. I grew a beard standing in line one time just waiting to ask about good restaurants in the area. Went back to my room to shave, and when I came back down I think someone in the line passed out from dehydration. Kidding, but you get the point. All in all if you're looking for a hotel with amazing and helpful staff, great location, and an breathtaking view, look no further.

Friends who came on same flight and stayed in other hotels had a bell hop meet them at the shuttle and there were 2 front end staff on.

Coffee and juice have been removed from the front desk.Coffee was never replaced in room. Manager said we can come and get more at any time. HELLO!!!! Isn’t this what that $37 resort fee is for??????. You shouldn’t have to go and get it. The resort fee included a beach bag and water bottle. We weren’t offered either. Can’t sit at pool for the dust and noise of the construction right outside the hotel. Even if you could sit out, this is a small area and you have to sit right next to other people. The loungers are taken by the people in the pool view rooms. (They leave them outside their room, with a towel on). You can’t get a place to sit, if you go in the afternoon. No shuttle bus, but their website still advertises it. I Was told to walk a few blocks and we can get it for free. We walked down and were Informed by other guests that it doesn’t show up. They stood for up to an hour and got the city bus, several times. Myself, many friends and family members have stayed here in the past and loved it. It’s a shame the new owners have increased the rates and taken away lots of other good things the hotel had. Every day we were there someone was complaining to the staff/manager about something. Everyone at the pool was complaining too. It’s very sad. It’s not the staffs fault. This use to be a great hotel. We have stayed many times. Now it’s so run down and short staffed. The photo is to show the construction. It is right below the pool. All you can hear is beeping from the machines backing up and banging from them drugging the old road/side walk to.

There’s was a change of staff which resulted in no communication between them of our situation. Every time I approached staff in that 3 hour wait all I got was a big smile and “ hello do you want to check in “ .Thus infuriated me beyond words . Finally got our room which was a bit of a disappointment small balcony facing the building opposite us , 2 double beds when I asked for 1 large and decor a bit dated. The only good thing was the proximity of the beach right across the road and the excellent service of Leimomi Baker the hotel concierge for you bookings,such a beautiful and friendly lady . Also as there website states free courtesy bus to Aloana shopping centre this is no longer available .

I was expecting a lot more from the hotel in so famous place.There is no bar or restaurant in the hotel, so they don't serve breakfasts!!! However they have so called ""resort fee"" for service you don't even use! Like newspapers, coffee or water in the lobby which is not even available all the time - I did ask once where can I get the water and I have been told to go to the supermarket and buy water!!! But they charged me for the it!!! How bad is that?!! Welcome oshibori - never happened! We didn't use beach towels or free shuttle to the shopping center or discount in one of the shops, but they charged us for this! I've never stayed in the hotel where I have been forced to use and pay for the service I didn't want or need!!! When you walk out of the lift the smell is just unbearable - the reception\lobby area smells musty even though this is open area without door!! The carpets and the furniture are outdated and absolutely disgustingly filthy!Rooms are claustrophobic and there is barely space to put your suitcase on the suitcase stand. Also the patio doors do not keep street and AC fans noise out. We got room 1818 and first night I had a problem to sleep as the noise form the bathroom vent was unbearable. I went at 3am to change the room and got one on 9th floor, I went to check it and we have moved the rooms in the morning. Room was exactly the same, but there was no annoying noise from the bathroom. However there was much louder noise from the outside. I didn't change the room again, as there was no point - all the rooms were the same, but fortunately I could sleep in the second one.The only good thing about this place is location - across from the Waikiki beach and the zoo, however it is the furthest hotel in the Waikiki beach area. There is also beautiful view from 18th floor at the mountain, the zoo and the sport pitch behind.I wouldn't stay in this hotel again in my life!","Dublin, Ireland","MarzenaDublin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",116,1.0

First night I arrived tired and sick after a 5 hour flight from the mainland. At 2 am the fire tones woke us up and an announcement went off to 'return to our rooms'. A few seconds later MORE tones went off that instructed us to evacuate the building due to fire and to get outside.Startled and not feeling well I threw on a sweater and walked down FIFTEEN flights of stairs!! Once outside there was NO ONE directing us or telling us what was going on. After about half an hour in the drizzle seeing no fire trucks arrive or any signs of fire we approached the check in area and were told it was a glitch/false alarm and that they were still searching to see which alarm had gone off.Needless to say I was NOT happy.The next morning I felt even more congested and sick due to lack of sleep and walking outside at 2am!The supervisor on duty (Jonathan) told us he would 'comp' us about $100 for the inconvenience. I feel the whole 1st night should have been credited! There is also a $45 per night parking fee if you have a car and $25 per night resort fee in addition to your hotel rates.Location is good right across from Honolulu Zoo.

I’ll give a run down further in the review.We checked in late, around 22:00 at night and had a special rate we booked through the website. We were tired and stressed out and driving through a foreign city had worn our nerves thin. We had planned on trying to find street parking but getting in that late and how tired we were we just handed our keys to the Valet. Check in was a breeze but someone had the same last name as we did, and almost had their reservation but my wife caught it. Simple mix up. You’re given two towel cards with a $30 penalty if they’re not returned. Our room was on the 16th floor and on the non ocean side (I think they call it the city view?) and it was a standard room. I’ve read that there is a bunch of street noise but from the 16th floor we couldn’t hear anything. There is a sliver of ocean from these views and it wasn’t that bad. I believe this was the standard room. For the rate that we had the room was ok. It had a fridge and safe, but only had two double beds. The room size is listed at 234 feet and man did it feel like it. The balcony was probably 30 SF and really small. Nice enough to take in some air but not large enough to even hold a chair and have coffee. The real kicker for us was the two double beds. The next day we opted to pay the upgrade fee and move to the Ocean View room. Others have written this and I had disregarded it and I shouldn’t have. Totally worth the extra money. This time we were on the tenth floor and the road noise was noticable. Not a dealbreaker, but I can see that if you were on a lower floor that it could be disruptive.The room we had did not have a bathtub but that wasn’t a deal breaker for us. I really liked the shower amenities included with the room. Water pressure was good. The WiFi was fast and free. The coffee on the lanai with the free paper was really nice. King Bed and pillows were firm and on the nicer side that I’ve had in a hotel. Personally, I’m big on the ‘resort’ feel and from what I saw on the internet, Waikiki struggles to match something like Las Vegas. Rooms are smaller and amenities are not quite as sophisticated. Park Shore managed to squeeze a ‘resort’ feel into a small package. For example, there are only three elevators and they double as the staff elevators. In a giant property this would never fly but at Park Shore we never waited long for an elevator and the staff were always very kind to us as far as giving us priority if the elevator was full.Park Shore does not have dozens of restaurants inside but it has enough to get the job done. There is an ABC store (like a versatile 7 eleven that sells everything) both attached to the property and another right next to it, a Starbucks, a small coffee/sandwich shop called Tucker & Bevvy, a Japanese restaurant (Yoshitsune which we did not eat at), and Lulu’s which I think is the crown jewel of Park Shore’s venues.Lulu’s is a breakfast/lunch/dinner restaurant/ sports bar/ night club all rolled into one. It’s open air looks out over the ocean and it manages all of these different personalities without being overdone. We watched NFL playoff games one afternoon, had drinks there another night, and visited it on Monday night when it morphed into a nightclub and each time it was well done (I wouldn’t give it a 10 in any single category, but for hosting dancing millennials, loud sports fans, and family’s with children in the same venue it did a hell of a job.)I mentioned earlier that they give you a towel card that you can exchange for beach towels. I didn’t think I would be using it, but I was wrong. Park Shore is as close as you can get for this level of pricing and the beach towels were a godsend. Additionally they let you check out beach chairs which was really cool. Waikiki is not the most beautiful beach, but it is literally 250 feet away from the front door and it’s very popular. Having towels and chairs right there was awesome. There is a walled off section of ocean in front of the hotel that is the most artificial ocean I’ve probably ever swam in: terrible for snorkeling PERFECT for small kids, those that can’t swim or just lounging around in. And if that doesn’t suit you, you can walk a few feet away over the pier and be in the regular ocean. It’s wonderful. I had planned on street parking but after using the valet the first night I realize that my patience and the stress were not worth it. It was so nice to be able to drive up, hand the keys to the valet and simply walk away. Likewise, we were able to walk up to the valet, show the tag, and grab some beach towels and chairs and throw them in the back of the car and be off.The pool is one the 3rd floor and was always clean and comfortable. During the end of the day at sunset, the pool sits in a little too much shade but there’s not much that can be done about that. The vending machine is here and for those desperate for a snack the vending offers some microwave meals (there’s a microwave there too/ and the rooms have mini fridges so your leftovers could be eaten this way) among the standard chips and candies. Oddly enough, there were no diet sodas in the vending. Not a huge problem with the ABC store on level 1, but still an odd thing not to have.Comparing this property to a five star Las Vegas resort is not fair, but it succeeds in being incredibly cozy and offering a smaller version of pretty much everything you’d get at a five star with the exception maybe of a spa. For me, getting off the elevator onto a lobby sets the tone for the property and this one did not disappoint. It’s not a giant cathedral by any means, but its large glass walls, open seating and gentle front desk all do the job. There are well appointed couches and juice, lemon water, and coffee as well as an activity office all present in the lobby area. Staff told me the property was fully remodeled about 8 years ago and it seems to feel about that old. Meaning, the property was built in the 70’s and remodeled in the late 2000’s and it has some signs of middle age. Bottom line, the proximity to bus (the Biki-app driven bikes, the moped place right behind the hotel, the free parking across the street), the quiet side of Waikiki, the amenities provided, the breathtaking view, and the fact that it was literally right across from the beach, meant that this property was exceptionally comfortable (for the price) and I highly recommend that you put it on your short list. I would whole heartedly recommend this property and I would stay there again. (I will try to post photos and edit this comment out later).

And just to clarify we are very experienced travelers and have typically stayed at properties ranging from 3.5-5.0 stars depending on how overall expensive our destination city might be.So first of all, this is not a 5-star ""Westin"" caliber resort but they are also nowhere near the cost that someone would be required to pay for a 5-star property. That being said I would place Park Shore squarely between a 3.5-4.0 star rating based on the following categories.1) If you book a stay here join their ""A-list"" club and book directly as they will not only (typically) have the lowest price but you will be given a free room category upgrade when you check-in (yes, it is based on availability but they will go out of their way to honor and accommodate it). Also when booking direct with the resort if the price happens to drop (at least 72-hours prior to your check in) they will honor the lower price if you contact them immediately and inform point out the lower price. This happened to us and the price dropped enough for us to book 1 room category higher and still get a few bucks credit. This great deal allowed us to get bumped up to a corner view room (#1407) with an amazing view of Diamond Head, the Honolulu Zoo, and all of Waikiki Beach plus the Pacific Ocean which was enhanced by the fact the corner rooms have a second window facing the other direction so you can see the rest of the beach and city!2) Service.....starting with the check-in process right through the end of the stay the entire staff at Park Shore was nothing less than exceptional in how the responded to all requests! This is an area I would gladly give them 5-stars!3) Location......another 5-star rating for this category! They are right on the beach (cross the street from beach but completely unobstructed) and also at the quiet end directly across from the Honolulu Zoo. 4) Resort building quality....this in all fairness is only about a 3-star rating because it is definitely an older property that has been taken good car of but nevertheless could still use some more upgrades (but please remember you are not paying Westin prices so don't expect to get the Westin). The building is kept very clean but a lot of the decor and furnishings certainly are dated.Our goal when we travel is to find that ""sweet spot"" which means getting as many perks as possible without breaking the bank (this approach allows us to afford a lot more vacations). The Park Shore in our opinion is an absolute steal for anyone who wants a great beach location, great service and a great price. I did a ton of pre-trip internet research on Waikiki resorts and our amazing ocean view room was priced significantly less than many other resorts ""city view"" rooms that were ""walking distance"" to the beach. If I wanted to pay $300-500/night you bet we could stayed at much fancier place but I am beyond happy to have paid under $160/night for our room and would not hesitate to do it again. That savings (which in our opinion was no room sacrifice at all) afforded us several great dining experiences and island tours than we may have normally done and we still came home way under budget!Well done Park Shore......well done!","Vancouver, Washington, United States","Lew V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Washington, United States</strong>",24,5.0

However, we did not want to pay the $65USD/night and opted to stick with our room since we were out of the room from sunrise-sunset.Beverages and snacks are available at decent prices in the ABC store connected to the lobby. There is also a starbucks outside the lobby. Lulu's, the restaurant attached to the hotel, was a fun atmosphere with good food. the breakfast portions were huge (we split an omelette) and the kids got the $4 pancakes. Great tv's and bar for watching sports while hanging out. The hotel is excellent for those that want to be on the strip but not in the middle of all the noise. It was always a pleasant arrival to get to the end of the strip and enjoy the chill vibe around the pier. Look forward to staying there again",,D F,0,4.0

Very efficient Bell Boy Team transporting and storing luggage.Direct access to Lu Lu's Restaurant and only minutes walk from many more.Direct access to an ABC store where you can buy everything you could possible need on holiday.Vending machines at poolside selling snacks and micro meals alongside a microwave oven.Complimentary coffee available in the lobby in mornings and water and juice throughout the day.Complimentary beach chairs available (but no parasols)NegativesDon't Rely on the photos on their web site, we booked an Ocean Front room that appeared to be directly facing the ocean and with a large bathroom with lots of shelves only to find that some ocean front rooms (in our case room 1507 on the 15th floor) had superb open views of the ocean and diamond head but side on to the ocean, there are other ocean view rooms directly facing the ocean but are set further back on the far side of the hotel. also the bathroom was quite small with no storage space for toiletries. The above inaccuracies in description were pointed out to the reception supervisor on the first day of our stay and she agreed that it was wrong and that they had been reported by other guests and was under the impression that they had been changed and would report it to management and come back to us, we eventually received a discount but only after pursuing with the reception staff a day before our departure, not good management procedure, they should have come back to us!Due to the hotel's location directly above Lu Lu's Restaurant there are permanent cooking smells when sitting on the balconyThe hotel advertises a courtesy room for early/late arrivals, we arrived four hours before official check in and were kept waiting about for five hours and were told that this room had been discontinued long ago.The hotel makes a major point of inviting guests to a weekly Manager's Reception which was a bit of a letdown as the manager was too busy to attend and the reception consisted of two staff members handing out nibbles and alcoholic/non alcoholic fruit cocktail from a trolley tucked away at the side of the pool for one hour PROMPT but made no effort to connect with the guests.The hotel group encourages guests to sign up to its ""A Plus Insider scheme"" which offers benefits such as free gift on arrival, we had to ask for ours and were given it the day before departure (this gift was a very useful small cool bag containing water and snacks) which would have been a bonus if presented on arrival whilst waiting for our room!!!Overall we enjoyed our stay, but travelling so far (from the UK) for a once in a lifetime experience and relying on the information on the hotel web site it could have been so much better with good management procedures","Nantwich, United Kingdom","un0me</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nantwich, United Kingdom</strong>",137,3.0

Cockroaches in the room, unprofessional staff, and fees for amenities we didn’t use. When we arrived, the front desk guy thought we were staying for two nights but our reservation was clearly for one. That was just weird. Worse, most of the time he was distracted, obviously talking on his desk phone with a friend. We heard all about how he might get off at 11, plus he said something about the hotel’s future that I would guess isn’t supposed to be public info. It was so rude—can’t you just text your friend on your break?When we got to our room, there were two twin beds when we’d been expecting a Queen. We went back down to the desk and asked to get a Queen room, only to be told that those rooms are not guaranteed and because we checked in at 9pm we had no other option. I’ve never had that problem at a hotel, especially one of this size. The desk guy offered us an ocean side room for an extra fee, but after we didn’t back down he finally admitted there was a queen room available on the third floor! So why did we have to go through all that?We went to our room and first thing found a huge, twitching cockroach in the shower, followed by another small cockroach on the floor. We got rid of them and by then, too tired to complain, we went to bed hoping there weren’t more bugs. But the hotel couldn’t resist making our stay even worse; when we checked out, they charged us an amenities fee of $51 for beach towels, etc. I explained we were only there for one night and we didn’t use any of the amenities, but the guy at the desk said it was a mandatory fee. So beware because you will be charged for those things even if you don’t use them.I’m so glad we only had to deal with this place for one night.

My parents had always stayed in this hotel for the last three times they were here. Unfortunately, now, we won't choose here again. NEVER.I would have given them a higher score, maybe a 2; however the last impression I had of them after our 11 days stay, was ruined by a lady (probably in her 40s) at the desk, as we checked out. Usually when I get myself to leave a hotel, I like to check under the bed(s) to see if I missed packing anything. Guess what I found? One big bag of empty beer cans under one bed and one pair of shoes under the other bed. They were not mine and I stayed there for 11 nights. VERY CLEARLY, they don't clean the room, otherwise, this large bag of empty beer cans wouldn't have stayed under my bed all this time, unless someone 'accidentally' brought it into my room and left it there.When I said mentioned this to the lady at the front desk, in a very irritated and disgusted tone, she said, ""Why didn't you tell us earlier?"" Is it my fault now because I didn't have the habit of checking my bed before I leave the hotel? Her attitude was completely rude. I'm extremely disgusted, not only by what I found, but also by her attitude. Yes I also did miss that big bag filled with empty cans under my bed for 11 days, but because we, as customers, pay the money to sleep in a hotel, NOT to clean? Is this not the house keeping's job? If it is, HOW COULD THEY HAVE MISSED IT? Even if they don't clean the room entirely during my stay, before a new customer goes into a new room, should they not clean the ENTIRE room? I still can't believe what I saw; even more, I can't believe how their customer service representative reacted to my complaints. Extremely rude, condescending and unprofessional. My parent stayed in the room next to mine, let's see what was broken: the fire alarm the first day, and gradually in the next few days, one by one, the safe box broke three times, the refrigerator either froze all the food in there or leaked, oh and the last few days, the toilet didn't flush properly. To be fair, they reacted to those repairment requests quite promptly, and they gave my parents...25 dollars off for 3 nights (we stayed 11 nights). This other person who listened to what we said reacted much more professionally. Please, don't blame the situation on the customer when it's clearly the hotel's fault.

We wanted something special for our 20th wedding anniversary. It's a long flight(s) from New England, and Hawaii is expensive, so we wanted to make sure to book the right hotels on Oahu and Maui. We did a lot of research, including on Trip Advisor, and decided to book the Park Shore Waikiki Hotel.The Park Shore Waikiki Hotel is wonderful! The location is the best spot on Waikiki Beach! Close to everything, but you're not in the craziness of the crowds. It's located on 2586 Kalakaua Ave. When you cross the street, you're right on the beach. On the other side of the hotel, crossing Kapahulu Ave is Honolulu Zoo, and in the distance beautiful Diamond Head. Public transportation/bus stops are nearby.The entrance is welcoming and beautiful with fresh flowers, you can get beach towels and chairs every day from the front desk, free coffee and water in the lobby each morning, with juice and water in the afternoon. The Wi-Fi worked well, and we were pleased with the mini fridge in the rooms, as well as the microwave that was available on the third floor, close to the pool area, next to vending machines. They also offer hypoallergenic pillows, which was really great, and not every hotel does so.All the staff was wonderful and kind, from the front desk staff to the house keeping staff to the bell staff! But to us, Kana'i was the star! (Mah man! We bonded over ukuleles )When we arrived at the hotel, two front desk staffers were busy checking in guests. One of them caught our attention. The way he was interacting with the guests was so welcoming, and giving them great tips on sightseeing. He was so pleasant, and we hoped he would be the one checking us in. His name is Kana'i. Such a nice, truly friendly person!When he found out it was our anniversary trip, he offered a free upgrade, which would be available two nights later. The upgrade was the best room in the hotel: the corner unit on the highest,18th floor, with on one side a view of the ocean & beach, and on the other side a view of Diamond Head.

More pros than cons so that's great!!! I was on the 8th floor over looking the pool and Diamond Head! I paid the $188 price to have a semi-ocean view on the hotel website.Let's start with the cons and end on a high note!Cons:1) On Weds, I waited for the free appetizers, and drinks near the pool and that never happened. So I was bummed about that. The elevators had a sign that said this would happen and it didnt.2) I asked for a beach umbrella from the valet employees and they told me they dont have beach umbrellas. But the TV says they do. The valet folks said, its regular umbrellas, not beach umbrellas. It's been really hot the past few days so umbrellas on the beach are a must! They do have some freebies if you ask for them. Like beach umbrellas, beach chairs, floaties, boogie boards....guests leave them at the hotel and other guests can benefit from them! <just a tip>3) The elevators were sometimes VERY slow. I found myself waiting for elevators the whole week.4) It would have been really nice to have our own bar near the pool. Just a suggestion.5) On Labor Day evening, Lulus must have had a big party because loud and booming music was going on until past 2:30am. It was so freaking annoying! (This wasnt the hotels fault by any means, but the hotel advertises for them and they should have said something that night.) I didnt get any sleep until the music stopped.6) My BIGGEST COMPLAINT was that the hotel television channel said that the hotel offered a complimentary guest room equipped with air conditioning, TV sofa, etc. My flight didnt keave until 6pm! Check out was at noon. I checked out before noon and asked the front desk to use the guest room so I could continue to use the pool and hotel amenities. She told me they DIDNT have a complimentary guest room for me to use! WHAT??? But the hotel television channel..She stops me and says she knows what the TV says. But they dont have one! I told her that I was depending on that room! I just paid $1,200+ to stay here! I was livid! She told me I could still use a towel and use the pool a d could use the bathroom on the 2nd floor to change. Gee. Thanks. Later when I had to take a whiz, I asked for the key and she ended up giving me my room back free of charge. I was totally relieved! Why wasn't this done in the first place? I was still thankful!Pros: This hotel was one of the cheaper hotels I could find so close to Waikiki. This hotel is absolutely in a great location! I couldn't have been more happy with the location! It's close to the beach, the zoo, the aquarium, Starbucks, shopping and so much dining! I enjoyed Lulus which is right next to the hotel even though their music was so loud I couldn't sleep one night. Location was everything for me so this was perfect!The room was really nothing special, but it had everything I needed. My bed was so comfy cozy and my room stayed nice and cool! I got a balcony overlooking Diamond Head, the pool, and the amazing beach view! I was SO impressed with the view! It worth the few extra bucks! The room had a fridge, a safe, and a blowdryer. My room was perfect! I heard others who got a higher level room could see some of the zoo animals, so maybe request a higher room? One thing I loved was the free shampoo, lotion, conditioner, and shower gel by Hawaiian Tropic! Smells just like the sunscreen so this was a treat for me because I love the Hawaiian Tropic smell! I loved the shower. I could tell it was updated! The staff were all very friendly and inviting! The WIFI worked in my room during my whole stay! The pool seemed clean enough to swim and it was so nice to get in on a hot day. There seemed to be plenty of loungers and chair for everyone. The beach view from the pool was incredible.

KANA’i at the front desk is an asset to this hotel and turned a not so great situation into a wonderful one!!. The location is amazing and our view as far as I am concerned is the best you can get in Waikiki. See below. I am kamaaina traveling from Maui, I had to fly over for surgery because they don’t do this surgery on Maui. I’m here for a week and wanted a relatively nice place with a lanai and awesome view to recover as I will be spending quite a bit of time inside. I booked the holoholo kamaaina rate directly on the website which waives resort fees and gives you a complimentary one category upgrade based on availability. When I checked in the girls at the front desk were talking to each other but did eventually acknowledge us with a smile after a few minutes. The girl was unfamiliar with the rate, the no resort fee, and the upgrade, and tried to charge me the full amount with no upgrade. She told me “I did not book that rate”. After 10 minutes of convincing (and I had my reservation conf with me in my hand which stated the deal) she finally agreed to waive the resort charge and gave us a partial ocean view room. The view was awesome way more than your typical partial OV, at first glance the room looked like it did on the website, CUTE CLEAN AND BEDS ARE SUPER COMFY! However this particular room was at a strange angle and we had a room 2.5 feet away looking directly into our room when they were on their lanai which they were. We decided we’d be ok and give up the privacy for the awesome view. We walked in the bathroom and there was a giant roach upside down still moving, and brown sticky stuff inside our mini fridge, the fan in the bathroom didn’t work and our screen door would not stay shut unless locked and the AC would keep shutting off. I called the front desk to explain and the the same girl offered to send up housekeeping and engineering. Housekeeping showed up immediately cleaned and apologized and were very sweet. Shortly after engineering showed up and told us that the fan didn’t work because the vent needed to be cleaned but he could not clean it, he said he needed a new strip to fix our screen door to lock. We left for the afternoon and came back 4 hours later and the door was still broken and so was the fan in bathroom. I called down to front desk and got the most wonderful, professional, understanding, kind and full of true aloha young man. **** I WANT TO RATE KANA’i AT THE FRONT DESK 5 STARS******I could hear Kana’i’s smile through the phone. Before I had spoken to him I had spoken with 2 other associates who were ok but not very concerned. Kana’i actually listened to me and his concern was real. I explained about my surgery, and that I just wanted a quiet room with an ok view to recover in. He was beyond understanding, apologetic and really took care of us. I am not just saying this because he apologized and gave us a beautiful room, it was his attitude and his concern and desire to solve the issue quickly.We did arrive early and they did check us in, 95% of the staff are very friendly, the location is the best, beach across street, next to zoo and park, plenty of food options, short walk to the madness of the other end of Waikiki.

The location is absolutely phenomenal with a quick walk across the street to the beach at the end of the touristy waikiki strip. Park shore had a few restaurants and an ABC store inside for little items and of course Starbucks just below - so plenty to eat and do. We stayed on the 11th floor and had an awesome view of the beach and pool with a clean, modern room. For those into water activities as us, surfing was easily accessible with the HH surf school/rentals located inside.Shout out to Brian at check in reception for getting us in nice and quick into our beautiful room and giving us and great local recommendations.ONLY disappointment was one fellow at concierge who advised us incorrectly on going to Manoa falls as when we arrived it was closed (and they were advised of the closure via email two days prior because he checked after asked about it....) expensive round trip cab ride. Cant fault an entire hotel for one dudes mistake though. For those who are new to vacationing in Hawaii, keep in mind this is not an ""all inclusive"" vacation spot, however there are great places to grab food for every budget (holla at mcdonalds for the 15$ beach bundle) All hotels charge daily amenity fees for wifi/pool/etc usage even though they arent actual resorts - park shore charges 25.00usd which is average.All in all, would and will be returning!",Manitoba,"cameeelah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manitoba</strong>",10,5.0

We don't mind the crowds BUT we also didn't want to be in the thick of them either. This was our second trip to Honolulu. The first time, we rented a car and stayed in Kailua in a VRBO. We quickly realized we are NOT VRBO people. We like our privacy, amenities of a hotel, and the ability to walk everywhere to get our food, go to the beach, etc. Having to drive everywhere in Oahu traffic was not something we wanted to experience again. So this time, Park Shore Waikiki fit the bill.We stayed in late Feb-March 6. Park Shore has THE BEST location for us. Not only did our room on the 10th floor have partial ocean views but when we stepped out onto our deck, we were looking at the peaceful Kapiolani Park/Honolulu Zoo grounds. We had treetop views which were stunning at all times of the day. A HUGE shout out to Michelle who put us in our room. We signed up for the Insider email before booking our room online which gave us 10% off the room rate. Part of the perks of the Insider rate is an upgrade upon check in (which Michelle did for us) and a cute little vinyl type bag cooler with a couple granola bars and water bottles. I think there were Hawaiian chips and cookies in there as well. Our vacation was really starting on a high note!! We only encountered a few minor issues that may bother some people but didn't effect us much.1) The room doors slam loudly--we just held ours until it shut in consideration of others2) There is noise from the street but that's to be expected with 2 major roads out front. The beach and park are right there so I just focused on those things3) They have coffee and juice in the lobby--coffee was not very good. The juice was refreshing after being at the beach, pool. However, I found the ABC Store #66 that faced Waikiki Beach (basically it's located in the lobby level of the hotel) had the most delicious self service drip coffee all day long (they had a Signature Blend, Moana Dark and my ADDICTION all week long, Vanilla Macadamia). For a large, it will set you back $1.46!!!! Starbucks is also right outside the hotel but I was happy as a peach with my Vanilla Macadamia.4) No bathroom fans---self explanatory5) There was an ""industry night"" party during one of the days we were there. Lulu's Waikiki was hosting it and it kept my husband up all night (3-4am). Even with a noisemaker to drown out noise, it was incredibly loud for him. I didn't know anything was happening so I guess it depends on if you're a light sleeper or not.We are already planning a trip back this January. We won't go anywhere else. We know what works for us and it is the Park Shore. We encountered friendly staff and it's location to restaurants, beach, more restaurants, etc is second to none. I also spent time in their pool, which is small, but it's on the 3rd floor level and with great views of the park and the beach so no complaints there. You also get a beach card upon check- in which allows you to check out towels and a small chair for the beach. Just return them and you get a card back for the next day. It was super convenient.

The hotel had to be evacuated. Not the hotel's fault, but annoying nonetheless. Then, after being let back in the hotel, the fire alarm briefly went off two more times, preventing us from getting back to sleep. ""Oh well,"" we thought. However, the fire alarm was really just a sign of things to come.Throughout the trip, we were CONSTANTLY woken up by loud noises. We knew the hotel would be a bit dated based on other reviews (which it was), but we did not expect the hotel to be so loud. Numerous people on our floor would play music loudly, slam their doors shut over and over, and yell in the hall during the night. You could also hear a ton of noise from the street. Worse, the hotel was not the least bit soundproof -- you could hear everything through the walls and the doors. We could never sleep well due to all the noise, and therefore, we felt terrible throughout our vacation.The noise didn't end there though. On a Monday night, the hotel restaurant/bar (Lulu's) decided to have a DJ with extremely loud music until 2am. Music was blasted and we heard constant screaming people as well. The noise made it impossible to sleep, and several police officers showed up on a couple different occasions throughout the night. We complained to the front desk, but nothing was done. We were told that the bar did turn down the music (which they absolutely did not), that no one else had complained about the noise (even though there is another reviewer who states that they complained about the EXACT SAME THING), and that the bar was just a ""vendor"" and so the hotel had no control over them (despite the fact that the bar is listed as a restaurant on the hotel website). This DJ night thing apparently occurs every Monday night, so beware!To be fair, when we left one day early, we were not charged for the following night. Additionally, we were able to receive a refund for one night's stay due to the noise. However, this took a lot of arguing with the hotel manager, and it was a small consolation for our vacation being ruined.On top of the incessant noise issues described above, we had other issues as well. The AC in our room rattled and smelled like mold, and we saw cockroaches run across the floor! There was a strange and unpleasant smell in the hotel lobby. One of the three elevators was out of service for the majority of the time that we were there (which is apparently a recurring issue, based on the other reviews). Because of this, it took a long time to get up to our room or down to the lobby, and we overheard several other guests complaining about this same issue. Housekeeping was rather poor, as they did not come to our room at all at times, things were not changed properly, and we found items from previous guests under our bed. Our stay was so bad that we decided to end our vacation a little early and return home. I cannot overemphasize how much of a disappointment the hotel was. Instead of our vacation being relaxing, we were constantly dealing with some type of stress related to the hotel. The only reason I'd recommend walking into the hotel would be to go to the Yoshitsune restaurant, which was delicious. Otherwise, I would never step foot in this hotel again!",,HnstRvwr,5,1.0

Yes, various shades of orangey brown, with plenty of tacky synthetic fabric - which thankfully we could ignore by stepping out onto the balcony which had a stupendously good view. The corridors had more in common with a prison. Why? When it could be the most desirable spot in Honolulu? It was reasonably comfortable, but given we paid in the region of $675 for two nights, it should have been. We spent much of our time in the hotel thinking how lovely we could make it if we owned it...which is not really the idea. Lulu's Bar, the main food/drink outlet is ok - there are great views of the beach if you sit at the front, but it is more industrial dining, rather than thoughtfully prepared food. Breakfast is big - one between two is fine - but despite being in the US's only tropical state, the orange juice was straight out of a can.

I am so pleased we chose to stay at Park Shore. The location is fantastic- not as busy as further down the street, however, everything such as shops, restaurants, and beach activities are still close by and easy to walk too. Further, the ocean, garden and Diamond Head views are absolutely stunning.We stayed in a suite, it was so beautiful! The room living area, bathroom, and bedroom were large, beautifully decorated and extremely comfortable. The heated toilet seat was a lovely bonus novelty!I particularly loved how the hotel didn't try to gauge more money out of you for beach chair hire, a lovely surprise. There was also always plenty of shade and available lounge chairs at the pool area. The pool area was not the most dramatic and aesthetic compared to some of the pools at hotels we stayed. Also because there is no restaurant or catering at the hotel you could not order snacks or drinks to enjoy poolside. But really the beach is amazing and just a stone throw away, with either garden grass area to sit on ( if you hate sand) or sand areas to sit at, so this is the preferred place to for swimming.The reception staff and concierge were extremely friendly and helpful whilst retaining a casual disposition, always giving a smile and a friendly wave.Oh, and by the way don't be put off by the foyer. Personally, upon arrival, I thought it looked a little tired. For example stained carpet in areas. The day we arrived we one lift wasn't working and there was broken furniture under the stairway.

Could not believe how old the airport is - but it did not take long to get our bags and away to our hotel. We are so pleased that we stayed at this hotel. We had a room on the 18th (Top) Floor, overlooking the Zoo and the beautiful Diamond Head. The room was a nice size and we had a small kitchen area, with coffee maker, microwave and fridge. The bathroom was small but adequate and the bed extremely comfortable - more so than the Bellagio in Vegas. It was about a 10 to 15 min walk to the centre of Waikiki where there are lots of very large hotels. Waikiki is very clean but we were shocked by how many homeless people there are, but then when we went on the Island Tour it was explained to us how expensive it is to live there. Visited Peal Harbour, very humbling seeing the Arizona Memorial and a great experience going aboard the Mighty Mo (USS Missouri). The weather in Hawaii can be changeable, we had some rain and a lot of cloud. Not sure if this was because of the Volcano erupting on the main Island which was around 100 miles away. As in Vegas food and drink is rather expensive but we had a lovely meal at the Surfriders Hotel to celebrate my birthday and the staff really made a fuss. If you like walking - you must walk to the top of Diamond Head, what a sight, it can be a bit dodgy underfoot in places and you have to walk through a tunnel nearer to the top which is not so nice when there are lots of people going each way. Get there early to avoid the crowds but more so the heat. Make sure you have a drink with you too.

The minute we walked through the door into our ocean front room it was evident that this was a place you could sit and watch sunrises and sunsets, and with great views of the beach and views across the gardens to Diamond Head (not distant views like other hotels). It was my husband’s 60th birthday and they had a bottle of champagne and chocolates in the room when we checked in; very kind and thoughtful of the hotel staff. The concierge staff were very attentive, along with the Bell Boys/Girls. On the seventh floor we only had to walk past a few rooms to get to the ice machine. The bed was comfortable, the balcony was a great place to watch people on the beach and the streets and the bath was a great way to relax after a day of touring/swimming/shopping. The room was cleaned daily. I can’t comment on the programs on the TV as we never put it on, except on arrival which had a welcome message for us. Having a shuttle to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre was a plus – no taxi fees and a phone ap that will show you where the shuttle is so that you can estimate what time it will be at the bus stop. All hotels have amenity rates, taxes ect (that you don’t normally pay for in Australia as a separate cost), which you have to expect, although when searching for a hotel I found their fees to be one of the cheapest. People comment that the pool is small but very few people use it and it does get a lot of sun (although we preferred to be on the beach as opposed to the pool). Whilst the rooms are a little ‘tired’ (need to be ‘refreshed’ a little and the pool needs a little attention); if you are going for ‘price, location, views and service’ I am not sure any other hotels could beat it which is why I have given it a 5-star rating. Would I come back here again – absolutely – it is away from the other end of town which is very busy and noisy but still any easy walk to many restaurants, shops and hotels and with a view like this you can’t go past it. Also an ABC shop is next to the hotel where you can buy a wide variety of food and drink and put in the fridge in the room (there is no mini bar in the room) , as well as purchase souvenirs and clothes. Definitely worth staying here as opposed to the more expensive hotels that cannot give you the same views.","Melbourne, Australia","Tistru</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",85,5.0

And you know what? I *was* excited!Unfortunately, the hotel was lacking when we arrived. We were told we had been ‘upgraded’ to an oceanfront room but when we got inside the room it was a slightly depressing twin single bed room. I called the desk and said I’d booked a King room, and they said there was nothing they could do. After pressing to speak to a Manager, and having to practically beg, we were given a King room with a partial ocean view which we thought actually had a better view and was a little less depressing.Of course on booking the Park Shore, we knew we weren't booking a luxurious resort where we could laze our days away poolside with a cocktail in hand however the hotel in general and the rooms in particular were shabbier than I was expecting. The bed was lumpy and uncomfortable, the refrigerator didn't work, and the shower pressure was awful. The pool isn't great, but a couple of minutes on the Internet can also tell you that. The resort fee was weird - not sure what that is covering.On the positive? The hotel is in a great position at the end of Waikiki, and right opposite the beach. Lulu's downstairs is a great restaurant/bar. I liked the Hawaiian Tropics amenities, that's a cute touch and the view from our partial ocean view was exceptional, from Diamond Head to the ocean and it was certainly the room's redeeming factor.Would we stay again? Probably not, but I'll add a disclosure; I believe I had the misfortune of significantly overpaying for this room, judging by other reviews and searches of the hotel since then. I'm not quite sure what happened as I was comparing the hotel to 2 or 3 others we've stayed at before that were within the ballpark of their regular prices.","Sydney, Australia","alexricia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",44,2.0

If you're looking for a luxurious resort where you can laze your days away by the pool with a cocktail, this is not the hotel for you. If you're looking for a well located comfortable bed to return to after your daily adventures in Oahu, then Park Shore may be perfect.Park Shore is located at one corner of Waikiki beach which makes it close enough to the action but probably a bit quieter than if you stayed in the middle of it all. The pool area isn't great - very small, dated and overlooking a busy intersection - not exactly a tranquil environment. But the beautiful ocean is just across the road and there's so much to see and do in Hawaii that if you're spending every day by the pool, you're doing it wrong!We had an ocean front room, which was lovely (and worth the extra money). We also had a great view of Diamond Head from the entrance to our room. The rooms themselves are dated and a bit on the small side, but again - this doesn't matter when you're spending your days out and about. It's an old hotel, but it would be easy for them to make some small improvements - an extra towel rack in the bathroom (one that doesn't hang over the toilet) would have made a big difference and a shelf under the bathroom sink to keep your toiletries on would also be good and make the bathroom more functional. But they are minor things. The bed was comfortable, the room was clean and the staff were friendly. The wifi was fast and worked well throughout the hotel. There was also free coffee in the lobby until 11am each morning and water/juice all day. Like other reviewers, I do question the resort fee, but this seems to be a thing at every hotel we looked at in Hawaii.Bottom line - everything in Hawaii is expensive. Park Shore was a clean, convenient and more affordable option for us so that we had more money for tours and activities, which is where our priorities were. I would happily stay there again.","Melbourne, Australia","GBug26</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",9,4.0

Its location at the quiet end of the beach by the zoo is ideal, easy to walk to everything else but more scenic and less crowded. The restaurants in the building are excellent and others nearby are good as well. You can walk to the zoo and aquarium as well as everything else in Waikiki.

Park Shore appeared to be in a great location - at the end of the Waikiki Beach. This means that the rooms either have an Ocean View, or a Partial Ocean view with a view of Diamond Head. We had the latter, and actually we think this was the better option: we could sit on the balcony and see the golden shores of the beach, and also the rather impressive Diamond Head crater. The room was a reasonable size, with a king size bed. The bathroom as a little cramped though. Being on the end of Waikiki Beach was good because the hotel is adjacent to Honolulu Zoo, so it’s not overlooked on that side. You’re right next to the beach, so it’s easy to walk down, and then along the coast. There was some traffic noise in the mornings, and late at night.The service and staff were really great: there had been an unexpected error in the dates of our booking, but on checking in the staff sorted this out without any issues and were friendly and polite. Where the customer service really shone through for us was when we borrowed the lobby phone to call the airline who had lost one of our bags in transit... when we returned to the hotel room later on there was a bottle of Champagne on ice after the lobby staff had heard our stressful situation. This *really* helped our honeymoon get off (from what seemed like a rather unlucky start with a lost bag) to a great start.

There is a trolley stop right at the entrance and we used that to get dropped off at Diamond Head.

Folks clean up after yourselves, take your trash with you!!!!...Housekeeping staff were very good too. As I am not a sloppy guest it wasn't necessary for my room to be cleaned daily. They did stop by each day and most days I happened to be there and traded a towel for a fresh one...nice ladies. Now one evening I had a panel in my room start to leak water puddling on the floor and called the Front Desk. They did send up a gentleman to look at the problem. He opened the panel looked around went and got a ladder and dry wet vacuum. Looked around again wiped up the water and said should it happen again call them. Got that right. I spent a nice amount for this room with a view and never did the Hotel Manager call or leave a message or note about my issue. They at least could have apologized for my inconvenience. I was bit put out as I have frequent here many times and have had friends stay here too. I know you might think well it was just water but what if I just so happened to be out of room for a longer period of time what than?

Based on information found on their website, we thought that the location, the room and the amenities offered were OK.

The staff were always friendly and helpful. It’s location next to numerous eateries and just across the road from the beach, park and zoo was very good.The hotel offered daily activities included as part of the amenities fees. We didn’t take advantage of most of these activities, but we thought the $25 amenities fee was steep for what was on offer in the week we were there. The one amenity that we found very useful was the free shuttle to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. The hotel building, elevators etc were very dated. The rooms were in good condition but very very dated. The air conditioning worked well. The shower and toilet worked well. The TV and wifi worked well. Towels were good quality and plentiful. There was a coffee percolator in the room but with only enough coffee for two cups per day. We had two packets of biscuits (2 biscuits in each packet) on the day we arrived. We asked for biscuits on the following days to have with our coffee but were told that this is only provided on the first day. Really! They must be expensive biscuits.We were given a family room, with two double beds. We would have preferred a queen or king size bed, but not for the additional $60 per night being requested for this option. We are not large people, but the double bed wasn’t wide enough for both people to lay flat side by side at the same time! The pillows weren’t great.We would recommend this place to fellow travellers as long as you are not fussy on your surroundings in the hotel.

It was our first visit to Hawaii and we were very happy with our awesome view over the ocean and Diamond Head. Go for an Ocean View if you can, well worth it. We arrived at 8.00am and were able to check into our room for an extra fee of $90 which was worth every cent. Breakfast was included in our rate and we thoroughly enjoyed both the view and the food at Lulu's on the 2nd Floor. Always great service with a smile as well. We were pleased with the location across the road from the zoo - where we spent a great few hours. Also had a view of the flamingos from our room which was special. Easy walk to the main hub of Waikiki but plenty of restaurants and shops close by. Beach across the road with beach chairs available in the lobby. Booked a Pearl Harbour tour with the agent located in the lobby with no problem.

Overall we enjoyed our stay. Cons: Rooms with 2 beds have double beds, which any two adults will not really fit on. Our daughter was with us so we had to get a 2 bed room but sleeping was difficult for us and we are thin/normal size adults. I think the rooms are to small to allow 2 queens to fit. The bathrooms are very basic. Standard shower inside a tub, with basic counters/faucets and fairly small. The hotel walls and floors creak and move a lot. Not sure if the building is swaying or if there is a wind tunnel, but it happens very frequently and all the doors rattle and the floors shake when it happens. Pros:Directly on the beach when you cross a two lane road. Lots of shopping and restaurants nearby. Staff is friendly and hardworking. Michelle at the front desk was always great to us and the valets were always fast and professional. Lulus restaurant was fun and had good food. The beach area in front is great and not overcrowded. You check out towels and chairs and can take them outside of the hotel. Location was good to be on the slower side of Waikiki but only a 10 minute walk to be at the center of it all. Conclusion:If you get a good rate it’s a nice place to stay. Make sure you request a 1 bed room and also pay for the view upgrade because some of the rooms have only a view of a nearby hotel tower/parking garage. We didn’t use the pool.

We choose this hotel based on the reviews and were extremely pleased and recommend this hotel. The location, selection of stores and restaurants, views, service and beach are perfect. We stayed in the standard room and for 3 of us it was okay, but a little small (2 adults, 1 teen). We had no view, we looked at the hotel beside us. Next time we might get a better room, but we spent very little time in it so you have to decide what is important to you. This was our first time to Waikiki and we noticed this end to be quieter and more enjoyable and less lineups and crowds. The beach is very close and you can enjoy riding the waves to the left of the pier or have nice calm water to the right of the pier. You can buy an inflated tube at ABC store for $4.99. The complimentary beach chairs from hotel is a nice option. The hotel offers complimentary morning yoga on the beach. The pool is a nice place to relax with great views. The hotel lobby has free coffee and water in morning and juice and water in afternoon. The park has beautiful trees and you can easily walk to another small ‘pier’ to see tons of beautiful coloured fish and crabs. The zoo is across the street and is lovely (plan about 2 hours or more if you want to relax there). The aquarium is a 5-10 minute walk and was nice (takes about an hour). You get a discount on the aquarium entry for kids by showing your hotel room key. If you can only do one, do the zoo. High end shopping and street performers are within 2-4 blocks. Farmers market Tuesday and Thursday. The Buffet at the Hyatt Regency is amazing and worth the money. Lulu’s and Tucker & Bevy at the Park Shore are both good. We didn’t try the Japanese restaurant. There’s also a Teddy’s Better Burgers around corner and a Subway close by. Two ABC stores and a Starbucks right at hotel. According to Google there is a Safeway store 1.6 kms from hotel, but I didn’t know until last day. We liked this hotel and we won’t stay anywhere else when we go back. It was perfect for us.

I messaged the hotel and they told me the only way to get two beds was to take the poolside room on the 3rd floor which also had ocean views and views of Diamond Head. I agreed.I'll add here that I have stayed in hotels in 15 different countries and have never had an issue with getting a room of my choice with two beds.We checked in, went up to the room, and had to walk above an alley to get to room 323 (see picture).Our room overlooked the pool. I could see the ocean from our room. But no sign of Diamond Head. Maybe I had to out to the pool area to see it.These particular rooms are like being in a fish bowl- unless you keep the drapes closed, you will feel like you are on display to everyone outside your door at the pool area (see pictures).Even worse, deliveries and recycling start in alley at 4:30am on a couple of the days.

I felt fortunate that a hotel across the street did have room for me but couldn't accommodate me for my whole stay so I spent several nights there which gave me breathing room to figure out where I would stay next..I NEW I was fortunate when after spending two nights at the other hotel, I lucked into a last minute sale for an ""oceanview room"" at the Park Shore. This hotel was very comfortable, a much better view than previous place but for clarification, the view was not facing the beach but looking down the beach towards Diamond Head. Not a big issue but something one may want to clarify at any hotel claiming ""ocean view"". Don't expect unobstructed 180 degree views ! The view was still beautiful, but it was more accurately, a partial (but substantial) ocean and beach view looking towards the zoo that is across the street !!! This is not a complaint and I wouldn't hesitate to stay in the same room again, I'm simply clarifying what ""ocean view"" may mean.The staff was super friendly and helpful, the trolley stops and The Bus stops are very convenient with one of The Bus stops being right in front of the hotel. Starbuck's is literally next door and that particular location opens at 4am. I have put the Park Shore contact info on my phone and fully intend to stay there again in the not-so-distant future.

You are paying for the location and the views. It is at the quiet end of Waikiki beach right across the road from the beach and the zoo and great views of Diamond Head. It’s walking distance to everything. I’m from London so we felt safe walking on the main street at night as it was fairly busy.Ocean views with 2 double beds are only on floors 3 through to 6. Our room, on the 3rd floor, was a partial view with view of the tower and a dirty rooftop. We wanted to get the view we paid extra for. The first person we spoke to was not that helpful. He kept saying it ‘technically’ was an ocean view room and that we could upgrade to a suite for £45 more a night. As we booked through a ‘3rd party’ (booking.com) he couldn’t (more like wouldn’t) change our room at a lower rate.We complained to booking.com that evening and they spoke to someone more willing to help us on the front desk and in the end, were offered an ocean front view room after the weekend when it would be available, which we decided to take. The first room on the 3rd floor was spacious, with a big TV and a bathtub with shower. The Oceanfront room on the 11th floor only had a shower and the bathroom was smaller than the other room. The water pressure was low in the Ocean Front room and we had issues with hot water, which were fixed after we told the front desk and the TV was smaller. You do get all the cable channels in all rooms.We had no issues with the a/c in either room.Lulu’s restaurant/bar is next door. It was pretty quiet all the days except Monday where they played music really loudly till 2 am. It was like a massive rave was going on and police cars and an ambulance turned up. So I would recommend a room away from it if you want a fairly quiet night on a Monday.The hotel was safe. Coffee and drinks in the lobby in the morning. They held our bags with no issues. You really don’t need a car. There is a bus stop right outside and you can walk to all the shops and restaurants on Waikiki beach.Apart from the issues when we checked in, this is a good hotel to stay in while you discover Waikiki beach and Hawaii.","London, United Kingdom","Leeya_uk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",10,4.0

Being from the mainland it's hard to get used to lobbies that don't have doors or even permanent walls. Many hotels just have an open lobby with an entrance area, like this one, but there's no way to close it off ever. There is very little room for loading and unloading, so that's a bit tricky if you have a car. The parking is expensive at $28/night, but if you're lucky you might find un-restricted street parking and the zoo across the street is just $1.00/hour.The room itself was very comfortable, great big king sized bed, shower with a tub. And of course, Hawaiian Tropic toiletries. Like my husband said, it's weird at first to use shampoo that smells like sunscreen! Nice flatscreen TV for quiet nights in, but we couldn't find a channel guide anywhere, so it was always a guessing game. They were very generous with the towels. There was not much noise transference from other floors, but we could hear the next room's TV often.The location is great, it's one of the last hotels before the end of the busy Waikiki beach. So not too crowded on the beach, and not too noisy from the nightlife. If you want to be close to the craziness, it's an easy fifteen minute walk. There are lots of great restaurants and shops nearby, but if you can get even just fifteen minutes inland from the beach and find a grocery store you can get things to stock your fridge and shelves without spending half of what the local convenience stores charge.We had an ""unimpeded beach view"" room with a balcony. If you care about your view then it's important to check on what kind of ""beach view"" you have. You may end up with just a sliver of beach between two other hotels if you're not careful! We faced the Honolulu zoo, and to the right of our balcony was the tail end of Waikiki (just blocks from the aquarium) and to the left in the distance was Diamond Head. Gorgeous view. We were able to watch the Pearl Harbor Day Remembrance Parade from our balcony too. Visiting Honolulu in December was wonderful, not too hot. The room's AC only turns on when the balcony door is shut, which is logical, so make sure to check if your room seems warm. There is a mini-fridge in the room which is quite convenient, but there's no microwave. There's only one microwave for the entire hotel, in fact! It's in something they called ""the break room""(?); it's not really a room at all. It's just the end of the hall near the pool with a microwave on a bookshelf and some vending machines.The hotel channel runs an advert for the hotel that mentions a hospitality room with a sitting area and even a shower that you can use after check-out before you have to go to the airport. They no longer have that room available, you can only use the hall bathrooms or sit in the lobby; despite what the advert says. It would be a wonderful idea for them to bring that back; we had a late flight out and a noon check-out, we wanted to spend our last day at the beach. We did anyway and changed in their hall bathrooms.The hotel loans out towels (1 per guest only) and when it's wet or sandy you can exchange it for a new one, no limits on how often. You can even keep it after you check out if you have a late departure, which was nice. They have chairs to loan too, but not loungers, just tiny little folding chairs that sink into the sand if you are more than 150 lbs. Still better than only having a towel. They offer yoga on the beach most morning; the card they hand out says ""just come to the lobby,"" but you actually have to sign up in the lobby so make sure you do. It's at 8 am most days and about a 7-10 minute walk with the instructor to a site that's near the beach, but in the grassy area and not on the sand. There is a yoga class almost in front of the hotel in the sand and surf every morning, but don't be intimidated. That's a master class with some locals and not the hotel's class! We did a very nice and easy yoga session that was perfect for beginners or those experienced in yoga.The pool was chilly, but it is December! It's not heated at all. It's a nice way to rinse off the residual sand before going back to your room from the beach, and of course they vacuum it out every morning. Our balcony looked right into the pool. It was never crowded, even during the ""manager's reception"" (I think it's Wednesday night). It was a 2-hour free punch and snacks by-the-pool session, but I never saw anyone from the hotel (like a manager!) who was there to talk to anyone. Nobody really interacted with anyone but travel mates.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","CMH-FC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",23,4.0

We do a fair bit of traveling, and we both agreed this was our very favorite place. The staff were both outstandingly friendly and actually knowledgeable about their jobs; they were able to accurately answer any questions and quickly solve any problems we had. When we arrived we were offered a free upgrade to a suite, which sounded great but wouldn't work for us because the suites only had one bed. Right away the young man (whose name I wish I could remember) offered us a roll away bed free of charge for our stay. We were dubious, but not wanting to turn down the extra room of a suite, we said sure; and what a great decision that was. The room was big, beautiful and had the best view of the ocean I'd ever seen. The roll away bed was brought up right away and was quite comfortable, but as it turns out it was almost a non issue because the original bed was so huge, and firm and blissfully comfortable that both of us could have slept in it without bothering each other at all.

The front desk allowed us to check in early. My sister’s birthday was the week of our stay, so the front desk upgraded our room at no additional charge. Upon check in, we received a beach towel card that allowed us to check out complimentary beach towels. Failure to return the towel results in a $30 charge. We left a credit card number for incidentals which is par with every other hotel. We had a hard time getting up to our room due to elevator problems which was annoying. Our luggage arrived at our room pretty quick despite elevator problems. The Room The room was on the 3rd floor and our patio doors opened up to the pool and amazing views of the beach. The hotel room was average but the overall hotel does feel dated and needs to be upgraded. Lulu’sOn the second floor there is a restaurant called Lulu’s. The food is decent but the views are amazing!

Slight misunderstanding/ mistake at check in with our room upgrade though - but all was fantastic after that. We had requested an upgrade as we did not want to look at another building when we sat on our balcony to eat breakfast or have a drink before bed. We were told the upgrade would be $50 a night for a partial ocean view/ Diamond Head view. We accepted and went to the room, however the room was on the corner of the two buildings which looked right onto another balcony and couldn’t see Diamond Head at all. When we went back to reception we were told we were charged too much for that type of room, it should have been $35. So they moved us to another room (which was actually slightly bigger) and after that, everything was perfect! They apologized and gave us a box of chocolates - I guess it’s just lucky we said something! To me, the location was perfect. Across the road from the beach and within easy walking distance to everything Waikiki has to offer. We didn’t eat at any of the restaurants around the hotel but they seemed nice. Rooms were very bright and cleaned well. I noticed they changed the shower curtain daily. I haven’t noticed that at other hotels before so I thought that was a nice touch to keep the bathroom fresh. The hotel can organise a shuttle service to the shopping outlets, and to the airport. They also have a free shuttle to Ala Moana - but we decided to walk, roughly 45 mins.

Beach right across the street was great. We were booked in a standard room for 6 days here (gift from friends). Our room was on the 4th fl. The rooms are small from a Mainland perspective but are average for Waikiki. We've stayed at a 5 star hotel up the street and the room wasn't much bigger. Remember you're on an island and real estate is expensive. Our view was of the hotel next door with a slice of the ocean if you stood out on the lanai (no chairs). As one reviewer said - you don't spend much time in your room while in HI hopefully!I had to work part of our time there and we like to hang out on the lanai so the next day we asked about upgrading. Michelle at the front desk was so amazing and full of aloha! She helped find us a 1K ocean view room and for a nominal fee to upgrade we moved. Our new room had an amazing view of Diamond head and the ocean! Great choice! Mahalo Michelle! Everyone we met from the front desk to the guys at the bell desk was friendly and helpful. The rooms are small but very nice, very clean, and have small frig and coffee maker. Housekeeping does a great job! Used the hotel beach towels. Did not go to the pool but it looked nice. We ate at Lulu's twice for breakfast and the food was very good. ABC store(s) right next door were great for water and snacks. We walked down Kalakaua/Kalia to go to other restaurants. Teddy's Bigger Burgers is also right around the corner for an inexpensive meal. We had a car so did not use the shuttle. Getting into the valet space in front of the hotel is a bit tight. The entrance is actually on Kapahulu Ave just after turning from Kalakaua. There is a $20 resort fee and $28 valet parking only. They cut the parking rate for military.

While the price is fairly cheap there are some things that just should not be overlooked when running a hotel on one of the busiest vacation spots on earth. Things like,Running water - every time we took a shower the water would shut off for a brief period of time. I told the staff about it and they quickly jumped on it, but it never got fixed. At that point we just dealt with it because we only had one more day there and we didn't want the hassle of changing rooms. Working elevators - apparently their whole elevator system is on the fritz. They had one elevator shut down for maintenance while the other two were just limping along. Every time we tried to go up to our room on the 12th floor it would take us about 10 to 15 minutes to complete the mission. The kicker was when i was trying to come down from the room and all the elevators stopped working for about 15 to 20 minutes. I was stuck on my floor trying to get down. I ended up using the stairs. What a crock. Clean rooms - You expect a room to be clean when you first enter and expect turn-down service to clean your room when you're gone for the day. Right? Well apparently they forgot about this. When we first entered the room it seemed fine but upon closer inspection things like the Refrigerator still had old food in it from the previous guest, the slider was left open and we had bugs in our room. The kicker was we left for the day to go explore, we came back around 530pm to clean up and our room was not cleaned by maid service. WTF! I immediately called and asked for towels and reminded them our room has not yet been cleaned. It took them an hour to bring towels btw. lol. The only upside to this place was the location and the staff was pretty friendly. I understand all of these mishaps are not their doing but the owners doing.I really hate writing these type of reviews because Hawaii is such an amazing place, the people are so great and warm, and you just can't beat the atmosphere of the islands. Even tho our hotel experience was complete crap it didn't put any doubt that Hawaii is one of the best places in the world to visit. <3 itSo future guest, please spend the extra $40 a night and stay in a nicer, better run hotel.

Are you not a pretentious 1%er? Then I definitely recommend Park Shore Waikiki. It's not an over-expensive resort - it's a quiet, affordable hotel with everything you could possibly need - the rooms have a fridge, an iron, a hairdryer, air conditioning, wi-fi...if you're not an overly picky person, or, basically, if you're a regular middle-class human looking for a fantastic vacation, then Park Shore is perfect for you. It's nothing like the uber-fancy resorts in Waikiki that charge $50+ per night in ""resort fees"" - Park Shore charges only $20, which is small compared to most Waikiki hotels. It's without pretension, because it doesn't need to be a pretentious hotel. It is literally across the street from the beach. Like, for serious, you cross a street and you're in a perfect swimming beach. You're also literally across the street from the Zoo and Kapiolani Park. My first day here, I was able to walk to the zoo, the aquarium and Waikiki beach, easy peasy. If you do not require a room that opens directly onto the beach, if all you want is a nice place to stay that isn't loud, where a ""partial ocean view"" means having an unobstructed view just from your window and only slightly obstructed from the balcony (and by ""obstructed"" I mean there's another hotel over there to the right. Oh no?) then you'll want to stay here. If you're on a budget, if you're not a picky rich 1%er, if you're content with a room that has everything you need without frills...stay here. Basically, if you want to enjoy Hawaii without spending an arm and a leg, stay at Park Shore. It's fantastic.(I must say, the WiFi did go out for almost a full day while we were here, but the problem was resolved in less than 24 hours, and if you're not a business traveler spending your whole vacation in your hotel worrying about the WiFi, then you have more problems than just ""the hotel's WiFi broke.""

Great hotel located right on Waikiki beach. The pool was quite small but when you have the Pacific Ocean a stones throw away in front of you why bother hanging out at the pool all day? The zoo is next door although we didn't visit this I'm sure this would interest most people. The hotel mainly had couples here didn't seem many families I'm guessing this is because of the pool situation and that there is no child entertainment. The hotel provides you with a card to pick up some beach towels for free which is ideal when you can't wash your own beach towels. Staff were friendly and very informative we arrived back at the hotel late one night and wanted something simple to eat reception was happy to suggest a few places that did take out food late at night. There are 2 convenience stores on the hotel along with 2 food places. The hotel offered some yoga classes which I'm sure would interest a lot of people. Coffee was provided every day for us after the maid cleaned the room and changed the glassesAnd cups every day too. The free toiletries were Hawaiian tropic which in the U.K is a pretty decent brand so that was a nice little extra. There's a free safe, hair dryer, ironing board and iron too along with vending machines and microwaves provided on another floor the air con was decent too. Only thing I would change is they could of provided some chairs for the balcony although we picked a standard room two chairs could of easily fit on the balcony. Wifi was also really good and kept us connected while on the beach right out side the hotel ideal for face timing home to make the family jealous like we did ;).

I've never heard of this hotel before (despite having been to Oahu like, 8 times) and was a bit skeptical booking it, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's an older property built in maybe the 1960s or 1970s, but the upkeep is really good, and the place is clean. It's a skyrise hotel, but the front desk is small and usually staffed by one or two people. Yet, we never had to wait long for checkin, checkout, or beach towel service. The standard room we got was slightly smaller than I had imagined, but it was still plenty for two adults. Besides, on a beautiful island like Oahu, our hotel room was just a place we kept our luggage, slept, and used the bathroom. My favorite shopping and dining places were within easy walking distance (5 or 10 minutes). I am happy to have chosen Park Shore Waikiki because it is actually quiet at night since it is not in the center of the bustling noisy part of the strip. The only true concern I have is that the door to your room is very heavy, and I had to help a wheelchair neighbor get into his room a few times because it is hard to hold the door open while getting yourself in...

Unfortunately my sister-in-law lost her battle to illness and so we jetted off a few months post this with heavy hearts but knowing this would be an important time to be together as a family. There were 13 of us with three groups booked in at the Park Shore. We had travelled to Waikiki a couple of times and were aware that most hotels can't check you in until 3pm. I had written ahead and liaised with the wonderful Roxy and she said that they would do their best to accommodate an earlier check in and were able to do so for one of our groups immediately on our arrival at 9am. The rest of us were able to check in shortly after 12 and were very grateful for this. From the airport if you book ahead, use Charley's taxi service which has a flat rate of $29 from the airport to any hotel in Waikiki and this is significantly cheaper than trying to get a cab at the airport. We requested and secured an ocean front room (1007) and our lenai (balcony) faced Diamond Head to the left and straight out to the wonderful Pacific Ocean. The extra money was most definitely worth it. We could also look down over the pool area. We requested two double beds and had two adults and two children and this was fine during our 14 night stay. The room size was fine and the balcony gave you an escape (and what an escape). The room was immaculately cleaned daily and new sheets were provided every third day. There was a safe and fridge and coffee facilities available. Situated either side of the hotel are ABC stores and there is also a Starbucks (though the best coffee was either Island Vintage Coffee which was a ten minute walk North bound on Kalakaua Avenue near the Royal Hawaiian Centre or a five minute stroll to Kai Coffee located in the Hyatt Regency. There was a walk through from Level 2 to Lu, a restaurant/bar which is a great place to take in a sunset over a drink. Hotel also offers 15% of breakfast, lunch or dinner there. The hotel is situated at the end of Kalakaua Avenue adjacent to the zoo and it's a 10 minute stroll to the heart of Waikiki. This made for a relaxing stroll home from the many restaurants that are in the heart of Waikiki (particularly after a large meal)!The hotel offered a free shuttle bus that would go to Ala Moana shopping centre and departed at 30-40 minute intervals throughout the day and would also pick you up and drop you back at the hotel. It was very convenient. We stayed at the Outrigger last time (heart of Waikiki) however for value for money and for tremendous views and friendly and attentive staff, we would have no hesitation staying at Park Shore next time and recommend it highly!

This was our second stay here. First of all, we love the location--it is towards the end of Waikiki (by the zoo) which means less foot traffic and just feels a little more laid back. The hotel is attached to an ABC store, which was super convenient for any late night or random necessities. There is also a Starbucks right outside and a great restaurant/bar right outside too (LuLu's). The pool is big but there is no hot tub. The only thing about the pool is that the lounge chairs are a bit worn, one tore when I plopped down on it and I am about 120 lbs... but no big deal because we go to Hawaii for the beaches! Speaking of which, the beach is right across the street from the hotel, that one is the ""wall"" beach, right by Waikiki pier-- better suited for kids, very, very mild waves but you are just steps away from additional beaches. The hotel provides towels using a card check out system and will also provide chairs (we used them last year but not this year). The hotel does additional little things to enhance your stay. They have a welcome reception I believe on Wednesdays and have yoga on specific days. There is a Japanese restaurant on the first floor and a surf school along with an Expedia adventure desk. The hotel provides a coffee/punch/water station throughout the day. We were in room 1014, room is a good size, king bed, and includes mini fridge, coffee maker, and additional standard amenities. The bed and pillows were super comfortable and clean! The housekeeper did a great job of maintaining the rooms clean. I believe all rooms have a lanai. This particular room has a partial ocean view, the only downside is that it also has a view of the building right across the way and the alley/garbage cans below. We would definitely book an ocean view/pool view next time. The bathroom has dual sinks, a tub, and I love that they use Hawaiian Tropic toiletries. The staff was friendly and helpful whenever necessary, we called ahead of time and were able to secure an early check in but they do have a hospitality room if they aren't able to do so.

Did I mention they helped me adjust my dates when we arrived a day earlier than what I booked, no added cost or hassle? (A mental mistake). All while greeting us with cups of cold guava juice during checkin. Lastly, the view. The ocean view (even the partial ocean view) is pretty darn awesome, with no hotel in the way to block that view.

By 'no one', I'm talking about the airport shuttle service, any cab driver, bus drivers, etc. Initially when we arrived, I was not impressed at all. The lobby has the feel of a remodeling project that ran short of funds. It feels incomplete with an overall feel of modernity with fringes of forgone tackiness. Everything is carpeted which really seems gross for such a humid, tropical environment. Also, the entrance into the lobby is open to the outside thus there is no central air conditioning which means it is very humid, musty and warm. After all the traveling were had been doing, it's not a welcome relief I was hoping for. There was really not much that was inviting and warm about it. On the day we arrived, the hotel was in the midst of a huge transition with many guests checking out and about a 100 more guests checking in. Unfortunately, we had to wait until EXACTLY 3pm for our rooms to be ready (we arrived at 9am). So, I would plan that out better. The rooms were actually better than I expected. We didn't get an oceanside view (although I had made the reservations months in advance). Our views were directly into rooms of other guests at an adjacent hotel! The rooms were clean and functional. There is a small restaurant LuLu attached to the hotel thru the lobby that bears mentioning because I loved it. This restaurant/ cafe saved me. They offered healthy good food at a convenience and a good price. Overall, the location of this hotel is great. It's practically on the beach and is along the strip.

Coming in their summer break and winter in Australia, there was a massive convoy of Aussies, Kiwis and of course Americans! I booked at Park Shore as I had friends already booked. It was rated 3.5 stars in the accommodation book I looked at. Which was fine considering I thought I wouldn't be in the room much. The lobby is bright and airy with friendly staff. Complimentary coffee and cold drinks are on offer with internet use in the lobby also. Free wifi throughout the building. The rooms are clean, nice beds and sheets. Plenty of towels etc in the bathroom with shampoo etc topped up daily when the room is serviced. There is a safe in the room and a huge variety of tv channels! My room had a great air conditioner that was very efficient. My balcony had a small view of the beach. I took a room on the side of the hotel, as a beach view was going to cost me an extra AUD$1000 and I bought I wouldn't be in the room much to enjoy the view so decided to save the money. Besides, the beach is only a short walk 30 meters away! The pool area is ok, sunbeds and chairs and tables there. It's clean with toilets adjacent to use that also are kept spotlessly clean.There is a beach towel service, that you swap a card for. So you can get a fresh towel when swapping your card or get another fresh towel. A great service when you go to the beach and then go to the pool.The hotel is situated at the end of the main strip, Starbucks underneath and a healthy little shop with fresh fruit, yoghurt, sandwiches etc on offer. ABC stores are located to the left and ride of the hotel. There are a few restaurants also located close. It was nice to be out of the action, but only 100m up the road and you're in it!

The comparison rate to other hotels is good but fair for the 3 star quality. For my 13yo son and I the only downside was you cannot get any cutlery, bowls or plates for your room, so having some food inside is not an option. This forces you to eat out all the time. In Waikiki, getting good food for a reasonable price is basically impossible. Getting out of Waikiki better food is available but if you don't have a car that's not so easy.

This hotel was great, even though it was Summer you could always get a lounge at the pool. The lobby was beautiful facing a large park. Very relaxed atmosphere. Free coffee and juice in the lobby and complimentary newspapers and wifi (all inclusive of resort fee) This hotel gets my vote because of position. Opposite Honolulu Zoo it is quiet and tranquil. ABC store in the lobby along with Starbucks both very convenient for anything you may need and both open really long hours. The rooms were a decent size as was the bathroom. A desk in the room was helpful for our lap top. It is about a 10 minute walk to the International Market Place. Personally I like being a bit out of the craziness that is Waikiki in Summer. We would stroll in for dinner and shopping and back out again when we had had enough. There is a free shuttle to Ala Moana shopping centre every 40 mins or so and return. The Bus stops right outside the lobby and you always get a seat because it is the start of the routes. Staff were friendly and always had a smile. We caught a cab to the start of Diamond Head trail which took about 7 mins and cost $12 we walked the trail and then walked back to the hotel. The walk back to the hotel from the end of the trail took about 25 mins. This is not a flashy hotel but was very clean and the rooms not small.

The abc stores are great for gifts and snacks and lunches and are connected to the hotel. They had pineapple that was really good. We used the bus system and the bus drivers were so helpful and helped us find our snorkel spot for only 2.50 a person! We did a lot of walking to the end of waikiki beach . The hotels in that area are all nice to visit and check out. I love Hawaii 5 -0 so we found the original badge and current show spots. There is so much to do and the hotel is in the perfect spot. The people at the Park Shore really made our trip so special. I couldnt have chosen a better room myself and I found that every day they answered questions and smiling.

From then on in got smiles and hellos from all the staff, we stayed here for 5 nights in a Poolside Lanai room and I think this hotel was a great choice for our family. We have a child with high functioning autism. The door is heavy settled to the Lanai so hard to open for a child. I felt it was safe friendly and a lovely atmosphere with helpful staff around us. They were genuine, normal.Pool towels were easily available and there were plenty of food options especially a cute little breakfast place in the alley way behind.If you want a quieter end of Hawaii opposite the zoo, beach, grassed area the Parkshore is a lovely choice . I would stay here again. It's down to earth and its meets your needs. Our needs were met with our kids it is a relaxed hotel, and does have everything available nearby if needed.The pool is simple but the view is amazing. You can paddle in the pool ,chin on your arms and look out to the ocean and watch the waves beyond the palm trees, across the road. Cab to Diamond head $14-$12 each way. The zoo across the road and the return local bus stop outside the door. The whole 5 days we were here we never had an issue. They also provide a free bus with Aqua to Alamoana shopping centre.There is a room just off the pool area with a microwave.Being at the end of the shopping strip We found it quite rewarding. it was quieter and we could see the fireworks at the Hilton strIght out on the beach on Friday night.( the closer hotels don't get this view).We will be staying here again - recommended.

It's in a great location, at the far end of Kalakaua Avenue, making it close enough to be in all the action but also not directly in the center of the madness. We were in an oceanfront room on the 14th floor and the views were spectacular. Our room was kept clean and everyone we encountered, from front desk employees to housekeeping, was very friendly. The room was a bit small but it was just my mom and me staying so it was plenty big for us. To be honest, we were barely in the room other than to sleep. While the amount of space didn't bother us at all, we did have a small complaint about the lack of storage space in it. There was only one dresser with a few drawers and we had quite a bit of luggage so we had to really live out of our suitcases a lot. Other than that, my only other small thing to mention is the parking. We rented a car for the entire time we were on Oahu and it was valeted by the staff at Park Shore at $25/day. The location and angle of the hotel entrance is kind of awkward and it was really difficult to get in and out during certain times of the day. All in all, Park Shore is, I think, the best for the price.

Not only did the hotel come highly recommended from the travel agent also , which is a massive understatement , the reviews on here and other sites praise this hotel.So we arrived in Sunday morning only to be greeted in the foyer , now in their welcome book they say that upon arrival you get a hand towel and a drink, this did not happen, we were told to wait in the foyer , 3 children and 4 adults and after being on a flight from Sydney , we were tired and wanted to rest . So we waited, kids started to get antsy , so we went for a walk , no indication from staff what so ever where to go and what to do . Thank goodness that there was 2 ABC stores downstairs and we went there to waste some time ... go back to the foyer room still not ready, needed to shower and just relax still no recommendations from the hotel staff were to go and what to do to relax and freshen up. Thank god for Lance , one of the bell staff , he came over and said to my husband and I take the kids to Ala Moana they have a play centre there .. on the shuttle we went as our room still wasn't ready . We went and came back even more tired than just waiting at the hotel, as our room was not ready until 4pm .. sorry but I'm coming from overseas my room at the latest should be ready 2 hours after my arrival not 6 . The on,y thing we did was get our room key go up and shower and sleep . I woke up and wanted to eat and so did my son and I went to reception to ask where to go. I got a blunt answer ""around the corner "" .. Being still jet lagged and all off I went and we found the place . So the next couple of days we wanted to do some activities so we spoke to the Expedia travel guide , where he comes highly recommended from the hotel to make a profit . We wanted to do a grand island tour and he wanted and was insisting we do one for 120.00 per person plus taxes close to $800USD for the 7 of us . Luckily we searched online and found one and we got on the tour the next day . I went to ask as to how to get directions to the Hilton Hawaiian as we have been there before and want to take the boys to see the lagoon and swim there , so I ask reception again I get a blunt answer of, ""take a taxi"". No elaboration on what else I could do it but this was the only way as taxi vans charge about 45.00 for a 30 minute walk trip . Asked about if the trolley goes there and once again got the blunt answer . So this is where I told reception exactly how I feel. I said I am on holidays I don't know what the best way is and you need to elaborate not give me one sided answers . The young man that was at reception couldn't really care if I had to say something or not , like it was too hard for him to offer some customer service. So the room... hmmmm.... very very very outdated and very small. The vanity in our bathroom had a crack right through it and my mums room had no hot water even though we mentioned it to the front desk still nothing was done about it .The chairs in the pool area are rusted and there is not cushions to sit in the hard wrought iron lounges which are also rusted. The coffee and drink stand is tucked away in the kiosk and there's only coffee and drink , nothing else like other hotels ie Hawaiin cookies etc . So for two weeks and for two rooms, we payed close to $7000 and all I have to say about this hotel is don't bother . The view from the pool is great , the pool is very average and so is the amenities room where there's only a microwave and some vending machines. There isn't even a laundry room and the nearest laundry mat is 4 blocks away... to say the least I will be coming back to Hawaii but I will not be staying here and I will definitely not be recommending this hotel to anyone I know . Not only are the staff rude and unwilling to help , the rooms are so outdated that the only thing that makes them some what 21st century is the TVs.","Sydney, Australia","Christine S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",6,2.0

The hotel features 4 restaurants onsite - Lulu's for more American food, Starbucks, a Japanese restaurant, and Tucker and Bevvy for a more healthy, picnic option. If none of these are what you are looking for, there is plenty of other options right around the corner.There are really two beaches divided by a short pier right across the road. One has a wall to break the waves, leading to a more family oriented calm waters experience. The other has larger waves which may be better for surfers and body boarding. These beaches do get busy, but we never had any trouble finding a spot to settle.Rooms are an alright size, however, I highly recommend paying a little extra for the partial-ocean view. We started off with the basic room and found ourselves upgrading mid trip. I know we were in Oahu and we probably should not have spent much time in the room (and we didn't), but the view was terrible. We really had a view of only the parking garage below us and the hotel across from us...not to mention the garbage bins. The partial ocean is the way to go, you get a sensational view of the ocean from one angle and from the other you can see Diamond Head. This is the last hotel on the strip so it is an undisturbed view of Diamond Head.Service was very good. The staff was helpful and attentive. Michelle at the front desk was very accommodating and helpful. John at the Expedia desk was also very personable and knowledgable of the island and helped to steer us clear of disappointment as we planned to tour on our own for part of the trip.Hotels in Waikiki are expensive, and this hotel is no exception, but after doing my research I would recommend it a option that is more moderately priced then the big names down the beach.","Toronto, Canada","mflei099</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",23,4.0

We had an incident when the sprinkler system went off in a lift at 4 am and the whole hotel was evacuated, supposedly to outside in the rain.

The staff are friendly and helpful. The hotel has a great position with most rooms having a view to diamond head and the beach. The pier was directly in front making it a quick walk down for some sun set photos. Shops etc were a short walk or quick bus trip (on 'the bus' the Waikiki public transport bus - which by the way will take you just about anywhere if you get the right one). Rooms are very clean and have a mini fridge, decent size balcony and big comfy beds. - there is no kettle or iron so you need to ask if you want there things. There is a great pub with live music, smoke but nice food and a great out look next door called -Lou Lou's. There is also tow convenience stores where you can purchase most things including basic food, drinks, alcohol and many other things either side of the foyer. There is also a good breakfast/juice bar near the entry that makes many breakfast and lunch items at a reasonable price. A coffee is also obtained at the Starbucks next door(actually a reasonably good coffee - and we are a bit fussy about coffee). However, The hotel has an out of date feel (like much of Waikiki). Due to a water leakage there were two lifts were out of order while we were there so the wait was long. The island ambiance we had thought about was not really there. It's hard when you are part of a city that is on tourist steroids. Maybe a revamp of the downstairs lounge and some traditional music might be good. First impressions last.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. However, I did have a number of problems during my week-long stay which you should probably be aware of if you're looking to book this hotel. Some of these seem to relate simply to poor management and maintenance:1. When I first checked in, I was put in a room where the balcony was inaccessible due to construction. More importantly, there were construction workers moving up and down in front of my window the entire day, 9-5. After complaining to the front-desk, I was moved to a better room. But I should not have been put there in the first place. If the room is not entirely accessible and there is no privacy, the hotel should not be putting their guests in those rooms. Fix your hotel first.2. An errant sprinkler system went off on my floor at 4:00am one morning, along with the fire alarm. After 2 hours outside, we moved back to our rooms, but the floors of the floor were soaked. They immediately started vacuuming the water with shop-vacs for several hours, which made it impossible to catch up on the lost sleep. For the next two days they had giant vacuum cleaners and dehumidifiers going on full blast, which made the floor very noise and much less pleasant than before. Of the three elevators, they only managed to get one back to working order for the entire hotel, and this stayed the case until I checked out some 3 days later. We would either have to climb 17 flights of stairs in the Hawai'i heat, or regularly wait 5+ minutes for the single working elevator to show up.3. When I was checking out, I was hit with an ""amenities"" fee of more than $200. As far as I could tell, this fee was for using their beach towel service and not much else. I was never made aware of this fee prior to checking out, so it felt like a hidden-fee money-grab. And while they insisted on the fee being paid despite little value being provided, they did nothing to compensate for the other inconveniences.If not for those problems, the stay would have been great. I have nothing but good things to say about the staff, and the friendly atmosphere. If you are the kind of person who doesn't mind complaining and making an issue out of these types of problems, you should be able to have a very pleasant stay here, as I certainly did despite the problems.",,denisz387,1,3.0

Maybe it is a little but that does not detract from location and quality of staff. Location:It's situated at far end of Waikiki strip away from all huddle and bustle which also gives you easy access to the beach. Perfect short distance from the sandy beach which has calmer section one side of the pier for small children then the more boisterous side for old kids and parents alike. Free beach chairs and free beach towels refreshed each time you hand them back. It's also opposite the zoo. It has an ABC store inside of lobby which sells absolutely everything.

The location was excellent, the room was comfortable, the hotel staff were friendly and helpful, and the view from the balcony was almost perfect, We paid more for a “beach front” room, which was a pretty standard room without a lot of space but with a balcony that had a beautiful view of the beach. (Minor complaint: The view was blocked to the right by the building jutting out with balconies close enough that we could have conversed with other hotel guests on them without raising our voices much. But we got over that disappointment pretty quickly just by looking straight ahead or to the left.)The location couldn't have been better (another hotel I almost booked, the Queen Kapiolani, had essentially the same location, but without the direct view of the beach.) If you wanted to, you could easily spend a week or more here without renting a car, just hanging out at the beach and pool and eating at a different restaurant for every meal. I almost wish I had done that.If you do rent a car, there is an Enterprise car rental in the next block over along the beach (in the lobby of the Marriott Hotel.) There are also a couple of convenient alternatives to the hotel’s valet parking. You can park for free for as long as you want on Monsarrat Avenue, which runs along the other side of the zoo, if you don’t mind a 5-15 minute walk to your car. Or you can park across the street in the zoo parking lot (all day and overnight) for a dollar per hour. I did both at various times with no problems.There is an excellent Japanese restaurant in the hotel lobby that we went to one night and got take-out from the next night because we wanted to try some of the other dishes. They give a discount of 10% to guests of the Park Shore, so that’s worth mentioning when you order.If you want to buy (expensive!) groceries, there is a Safeway about a half-hour walk up the road away from the water.If I go back to Oahu, I would definitely try to book here again.

We were completely surprised because all the reviews we read talked about how ""calming"" and ""quiet"" their stay was at this hotel. My husband and I have visited Waikiki on several occasions and we have usually stayed at either the Outrigger or Hilton Village. Because we now have a 3 yr old, we chose this hotel because of it's proximity to the zoo and aquarium - we completely regret our decision. On our first night, our family was subjected to hearing terrible karaoke singing from the restaurant below. Then the next 2 nights, we had to endure heavy base music with the DJ shouting into the microphone trying to pump up the crowd. What added to the noise was the crowd shouting, laughing, and occasionally fighting outside the club. When I spoke with the receptionist, I was advised that the club would be closing at 2 am. I did not get any impression of sympathy from her. I finally sent an email to the hotel on the 3rd night to complain that my family couldn't sleep because of the noise. I didn't receive any email back but the music finally stopped on the 4th night. When we were checking out, the receptionist did not acknowledge my complaint. Our stay at this hotel was extremely disappointing. While the proximity to sites and the beach was convenient, the lack of sleep and poor customer service we experienced due to the club noise just ruined our trip.",cristinevan,"cristinevan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>cristinevan</strong>",6,2.0

Travelling alone I always felt safe during my stay and was greeted on return each day inquiring about how my day had gone. The lobby also houses a tour company that are fantastic at organizing all sorts of tours and activities. You do need to be aware that quite a lot of O'ahu's homeless hang around the Starbucks and ABC stores trying to beg money or cigarettes - but the Police will quickly move anyone being a pest along and at no time did I feel unsafe.

Sure you have to get through traffic and turn in, but you cannot avoid that. The entrance is on Kapahulu so there were less cars and people to wait for, so it was easier than most places on the strip. Upon entry, we were greeted by a large clean room with welcoming staff (Po at the front desk was especially helpful!)The room was standard size, clean, but could have used a more updated bed for comfort. We lucked out with views of the zoo, the crater, and the beach!The pool deck was always clean and offered a variety of chairs and loungers, as well as umbrellas. It's not huge, but adequate for the amount of people that were swimming at any given time. Would have loved to have a drink and snack bar, but at least you're allowed to bring your own. There's a starbucks, tucker & bevvy (prepackaged sandwiches and snacks), Yoshitsune (sushi), and Lulu's (best happy pricing i found!) on site for your convenience. Beach is right across the street, and they are happy to loan you towels and/or chairs. Lulu's is an open air bar, and there's another at the hotel right next door, which is great.

The room was very small and had we been there longer than 3 nights, it would have become annoying. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. Also, we arrived a bit early after a very long flight from New Zealand, and the lack of flexibility on letting someone in a room early negates any friendly staff. Everyone knows that all of the rooms do not miraculously become clean at 3:00 and there weren't many people there early, it would not have any major detrimental effect to let people in, if the room is ready. Although I was warned about the valet parking charge, the $20.00 amenity fee was a surprise. Both of these fees push the cost of the room over what it was worth. And be aware, if you're looking for a place to drive ""in"" to the hotel, it is only a couple of parking spaces in the very front of the place.

We have been staying at Park Shore for 8 years now including the year we brought all of our wedding guests and other years when we book multiple rooms. Considering all of the fantastic loyalty schemes we have in Sydney hotels, it has always been disappointing to not be rewarded for return visits (6). And this time we encountered the new $20 resort fee since the hotel merged with Aqua I guess. I know it seems to include plenty but having stayed many times before, much of this was already included at this hotel which is one of the reasons we loved it and the extras cost extra anyway. The shuttle is included but not the tip so it works out the same price as the trolley. The chairs require a tip so better off buying one from ABC and the yoga requires a tip. So coming from a non-tipping country (and can I say we always tip when in Hawaii) these bonuses are actually costing money. Of course, the location is fantastic, the rooms are lovely, the staff are mostly helpful but I think the price is getting a little high. We also paid a lot more to upgrade our room this year than previous years. I see there is now an ""insider"" rate but I can get that rate through AAA so there is still no ""reward"" for return visitors.

I didn't expect it to be waived, but it would have been ""nice"" though since we did book so many months in advance, made full payment at the time of booking and front desk did see our tired children. Despit the tiredness at check in, our family of five were still very cheerful to just be in Hawaii!

We requested rooms to be 2 beds and the other 1 King. Both rooms were 2 beds (so hubby and i had seperate beds!). Did not bother to bring this up with management because as i said earlier, we were too exhausted from our flight and just left it. Personally, i just didn't want to deal with the unfriendly desk manager. We also paid $25 per day for valet parking - the bellboys were polite, courteous and always very friendly. Not so much front desk. We never saw anyone from front desk say a warm hello or even crack a smile. Both check in and check out was served by the same ""manager"". Though she was just doing her job, i did not find her ""warm"" or ""friendly"". That might just be me. The rooms were clean and the beds were made daily.

Made for great mornings drinking coffee on our balcony! The location was also great. It was right across the street from the beach, and close to the zoo and aquarium. All of the stores, restaurants, etc. along the Waikiki beach walk were easy to get to, and it was also nice to walk the other direction for some quieter beach areas.

Good price (for Waikiki) and location, within easy walking distance to zoo and aquarium. Nice lobby, slightly creepy hallway to rooms on our floor, lots of electrical outlets in room (a plus), seedy elevators (1 out of commission during our stay). The hotel has a shuttle to some other hotels and the Ala Moana shopping center that proved very unreliable for me. No regular schedule, it seems. I wound up taking the #8 bus back to the hotel after waiting 20 minutes beyond the time the driver said he'd be back. (I had to be back by 5 and made it just in time.) Another drawback, particularly for a hotel that says it was recently renovated/updated: who still uses full-size beds anymore? Don't want to end this review on a negative note, however: Hotel staff here is very nice and tries to be helpful, and the Japanese restaurant (Yoshitsune) off the lobby was a delightful cultural experience.

We had a fantastic experience. We originally chose the hotel based on the rates and location. We booked on their website with their promo to get an upgraded room if available. We booked a normal room with city/mountain view. When we got to the hotel we were upgrade to a ocean view! It even had a mountain view too. Definitely recommend doing this if available. The location was the best part of the hotel. It's located at the end of the hotel strip on Waikiki beach. This was great because it was less busy at that end, while still in walking distance of all the shops and restaurants. Also the beach, which is across the street, is less crowded too. If you head left once coming out of the hotel there are no resorts and not as many people on the beach. If I had to choose a negative it would be the room itself. It wasn't bad, but little things that seemed outdated. Some chips in some wood. This is not a deal breaker. In Hawaii you aren't spending much time in the room. Again if I had to say something negative about the stay, but it's really nitpicking. One tip that turned out great for us. I took surfing lessons, but not from the place in the hotel, from the hut on the beach directly across the street. It's only $40 for an hour lesson (trust me you won't need more, it's more tiring than you think!). Don is really a good instructor and they took pictures and put it on a flash drive for you. The flash drive with pics was $45 and they used a really nice camera to take pics. I got 100+ pictures of me surfing for the first time, it was definitely worth it!We did not rent a car and glad we didn't. Valet I think is $20 or $25 a night. We walked places or took Uber/Lyft. Plus talked to the local drivers and learned the best places to eat. All in all, I would definitely recommend the Park Shore to anyone staying on Waikiki beach and would definitely stay there again if I go back.",,Nick M,7,5.0

We knew it was before the check in time but we were told to go see them anyway so they knew we had arrived. We did this. While we waited in line, there were two people on the desk working. The lady exclaims she is going to lunch and walks off. That’s fine, people need to eat right? Anyway, only a few moments later she reappears and seems a bit annoyed. As she serves us, I explain that we’re here to check in. She angrily announces that check in isn’t until 3pm and we’re way too early and that a room won’t be ready until after 3pm. We arrived just after 1pm and I already stated to her that I knew this. We didn’t even want to get into our room, we just wanted to leave our bags so we could go across to the zoo. After a few words were spoken, she finally got me to write out the forms and then told us again in her own words, ‘Do not come back until after 3pm.’ It wasn’t until after that I wished I had gotten her name so I could make a complaint.Fast forward a few hours, we arrived back and were allowed to check in properly and were given the keys to the room. We had requested two beds but instead were given one. When we asked the question we were told that no such thing was on our booking yet it was all over the paperwork we were given. We were also told if we wanted to move rooms we could but we would have to give up the view we had. Mind you, we booked and paid for a front ocean view room with two beds. We decided to let this go as we didn’t want this to hinder our vacation. I must add we were never offered the towels or refreshments that were stated on the website that we would get on check in. It was only three days into our vacation that we found out where they were in the lobby. Most of the stay was okay and problem free but a day before leaving we left for a tour only to come back to our room with a few of our toiletries missing and someone had tried to use one of the iPads we had in the room. We only know this as originally the iPad was off but was turned on with a notification saying wrong password had been entered. So if you do plan to stay at this hotel please keep in mind that your personal belongings may either disappear or will be touched/used etc. We didn’t bother reporting this as we were treated badly in the beginning so we figured there was no point.","Brisbane, Australia","tasteslikewanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",15,2.0

When traveling, I quickly get tired of eating fast food and running around after I'm off work, just trying to get a meal before I turn in for the night. This hotel has only a small ""cube"" fridge, and no microwave in the rooms. This is most likely due to the hotels embedded restraunts, the Japanese place on the first floor, and another place upstairs. So, shopping at Walmart and bringing food back to the room to eat after work isn't going to work. Around the Waikiki area, there is also no parking, so driving somewhere to eat will require going across town, to the area of Wheeler AAF to be able to park and shop, or eat. Also, the only availablr parking at the hotel is a valet service, that will cost you $30.00 per day, over and above the already high cost of the small room you'll be staying in. Yes, there is the Zoo, the Beach, a burger joint around the corner, etc, but plan on walking everywhere to do anything else, as parking is little to nil. The Hotel Staff are pleasant to deal with, especially the Valet guys, who seem to be very cheerful. Overall, as a tourist, this place would be ok. For business, not so much, especially if it's an extended stay. As mentioned in the Hotels pitch description, every room has a ""private Lanai"", and I have attached pictures of the view from my room. Nice, if I had any voyeuristic tendencies. Otherwise, rooms with Ocean views will set you back much more than the $161.00 that this particular room costs each day. Overall, if there were somewhere closer to Wheeler AAF, I'd be there. The rat-race of Waikiki isn't worth the frustration, especially for business travelers.","Hereford, Arizona","Harry S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hereford, Arizona</strong>",9,2.0

Also no eating table, but a little patio table on the balcony where we had our breakfast every morning. It was a little small for a 2 week stay but then we weren't in our room much.

The fridge was nice to have and the bed was comfortable (linens changed every 3rd day.) We only swam in the smallish pool a couple times as we preferred to swim in the ocean.

No view but extra $50 and you will be given a room with a view. Room was a twin and not a double and the bathroom needed upgrading. No guest laundry either.

Check in was at 3 so that would be an additional 50 dollars. Same goes for late check.. 10 dollars an hour. I have been to many hotels and have never been charged an additional fee for either early check in or late check out. We opted to put our luggage in the storage room and came back at 4 pm. The room was ok. Nothing great about the standard room but we didn't plan on being in the room a lot. The next day we left the room at 8:30 am and came back at 3:45 pm. The room had not been cleaned up. We planned to be in the room just to freshen up before we went to a luau. We wanted to leave around 5pm. At 4, maid service knocked at the door and wanted to clean the room. I asked her to come back at 5pm and she said she was done for the day at 5. I asked for clean towel and to replenish the shampoo. She quickly serviced the items I asked for in the bathroom and then left. Beds were unmade, trash baskets not cleaned. Used glassware not replaced. I was not happy with that situation. Also, I personally do not like using elevators. I would rather use the stairs. From the lobby you can not use the stairs for access to or from your room. There are alarms on exit doors on each floor below floor 3. You can go into the stairwell from an upper floor but can not get out of the stairwell without tripping an alarm below floor 3.

We arrived at the airport 10am and called the hotel if we could check in early. They were very happy to accommodate us and get us in early which I think was just awesome. We've been coming to Hawaii about 3 times annually for the past 6 years and stayed at the Aston Waikiki, Aulani, AirBNB, Hilton Hawaiian Village, Moana Surf Rider and many others. We decided to try Park Shore Waikiki for the simple fact that it was towards the end of our favorite part of the strip as far as getting in and out of Waikiki Strip. We originally booked a room facing the Aston Waikiki with no ocean view since it was within our budget. We started to think that we really wanted some type of ocean view, so we asked the front desk receptionist, Roxie, if there were any upgrades available and how much extra it would cost. Roxie was able to accommodate our request and not only did we get ocean view, we also got the view of Diamond Head in room #1509!! So thank you Roxie for making our anniversary that much more special and memorable. After checking in and getting to the room, there was a knock at the door about 15 minutes later and we had a surprise visit from one of their staff with champagne, wine glasses and a box of macadamia chocolates! This was sure looking to be a great start for the weekend thanks to the efforts of Roxie and her crew. Our room was clean and the balcony views of the outside were really gorgeous and breathtaking. The bed was comfy, the shower was great and the room itself was cozy and perfect for the both of us. We definitely prefer it over the Aston next door from the staff to the room--not to mention it's corner location of the strip! We will definitely stay here again and recommend it to all of our family and friends who love to travel to Hawaii as well. I would encourage anyone to give them a shot and you might be surprised with them. Especially since their staff at the front desk is amazing--just as long they have people like Roxie and Riza warmly accommodating you upon arrival! Of course not everyone will love it as much as we do, but I must say the value you receive and pay here is well worth the money.

Still close to plenty of restaurants and shops and all that Waikiki has to offer but just not right in the midst of the madness. The hotel is fine - clean and decent service, but it could be so much more. The pool deck on the third floor as wonderful views across the park to Diamond Head and to the beach and ocean, but there are few if any amenities - a bar here would be awesome!

Thank you for making our 9 day stay feel like home.TRANSPORT TIPS for those of us who refuse to drive on the otherside of the road: - Free shuttle to Ala Moana (although we tipped the driver a few bucks for 3 of us). - Catch the #22 bus ($2.50) across road by the beach to get to Hanauma Bay (this is also where the green and orange line trolleys stop). - Bus #8 stops right outside the hotel (as does a few others, check thebus.org). - Shark tours & PCC pick ups are at the Marriott Hotel on Paoakalani Ave (short walk around the corner). - Pink Line Trolley stops at the Aston Hotel just next door. - Swap Meet - Catch the #42 bus ($2.50) just down the road on the cnr of Kapahulu/Kuhio OR the Purple Line Trolley is $25pp all day OR for 3 of us, it cost $7.50 to get there on bus and $50 taxi back to Park Shore (because our shopping was horrendous!)- Walmart - the free shuttle includes a stop at Pagoda Hotel, close to Walmart, OR you shuttle there and it's a $15 taxi ride back to Park Shore + $3 tip (if you have to buy more suitcases!).Hope this helps your planning.Free wi-fi all over the hotel.

You have to go to the valet desk and give them your ticket. We were in a hurry but it took 25 min for them to bring our car. There wasn't even anyone else waiting. They refunded our money and we parked near the zoo, 5 blocks away after that. Our party had 4 rooms and none of our rooms were cleaned or made up for the 2 nights we stayed. The check in took a very long time with a long slow moving line. The front desk people seemed pretty harried when we arrived and were short with us but were very nice after that.

It's not the Ritz but it is a clean, comfortable basic hotel with a wonderful location! It is on the corner of Kapahulu (the front entrance is located here) and Kalakaua Ave. which runs along the beach. It is just steps from the beach and Waikiki Wall (a pier where you can walk out on the water a bit), the zoo is across the street, and most tours pick up just down the block on Kapahulu Ave. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, a Starbucks next door, several ABC stores (one inside and one next door) where you can purchase drinks, snacks, souvenirs, alcohol and a ton of other things and it has a great view of Diamondhead. Kapiolani Reg. Park and a small Waikiki Aquarium are within easy walking distance. The staff was friendly and helpful, housekeeping did a good job. There is also a sushi restaurant and sandwich shop inside the hotel. There are 18 stories. We booked an ocean front with lanai and it was worth every penny just for the views alone. Our room, #1707, was a corner room with a window looking out on the beach and ocean and the balcony looking out on Diamond Head, the zoo, and another portion of Waikiki Beach. The rooms are a bit minimalist with just a desk and chair but no chairs for relaxing. The bathroom has almost zero space for your toiletries but it did have a mini-fridge, iron and board, hair dryer and toiletries provided as well as providing towel cards for taking towels to the beach and it has a pool. It is one of the furthest hotels from the airport since it is located almost at the end of Waikiki Beach but we had no problems with that. We did not have a car and everything we needed was within easy-walking distance of the hotel, and I mean easy as everything was probably within a block or two.

We were given a room on the highest floor with excellent views of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach. The room was in great condition and we were extremely satisfied.The location is perfect if you have a car. There is free parking on Monsarrat Ave nearby. We always found a spot available within ten minutes walk of the hotel. The hotel is also right across the street from the beach so it was very convenient. That section of the beach is walled off so it's always calm and you don't have to worry about windy days and waves. The hotel gives you free beach towels and chairs to use on the beach. Grateful for the free water and juice downstairs in the lobby. There is also an Expedia travel concierge you can use to book tours and tickets for things. The only complaints I have about the hotel are minor. There is free coffee in the lobby in the mornings but they don't provide milk or creamer. Not a huge deal as there is an ABC store literally connected to the lobby. Also to get beach towels, you have to exchange these towel cards for them and exchange the towels back for the cards. If you don't return the cards when you checkout you'll get charged per card not returned. This is fine except that I only ever saw at most two people manning the front the desk, most of the time it was only one which meant sometimes you had to wait awhile just to do the exchange. None of these complaints really impacted our stay negatively.Overally great experience, highly recommended, and for sure we would stay here again if we come back.

This was going to be a better-than-average review. But, unfortunately, I'm not able to totally give that review. And it's all because of a $20.94 charge. Here's my story . . . I found out only a week before our arrival that we'd be spending one night in Honolulu. Having never been there before, and only able to rely on TripAdvisor reviews, I chose the Park Shore Waikiki and booked it through the TripAdvisor site. And now, here's what would have made this a better-than-average review:Once we arrived and checked into the corner property, my husband and I were happy that the Park Shore was my choice. Waikiki Beach fronts one side of the hotel, while on the other side the entrance into Park Shore faces Diamondhead and Queen Kapiʻolani Regional Park (which includes the Honolulu Zoo and the Waikiki Shell, an outdoor concert/gathering venue.) Our room, a representation of 1970's Hawaiian-style minimalist design, was clean and comfortable. Our favorite part was the lanai (balcony,) which overlooked the pool and had a panoramic view that spanned from Diamond Head across Waikiki Beach. The location, for us, was perfect! The view was breathtaking! It's a less congested part of Waikiki Beach. Everyone at the hotel was very nice. We enjoyed Tucker and Bevvy for smoothies and had an amazing lunch in Lulu's Waikiki, a Japanese restaurant. Both are located just off the hotel's lobby. Park Shore not only has a secure baggage check room, but also supplies a courtesy room set up like a living room with an attached bathroom (with shower.) This is an added plus for guests who have already checked out, providing them with an opportunity to freshen up or relax before late flights or cruise embarkations. The courtesy room gave us the chance to check out, explore Waikiki and then freshen up and relax before our shuttle picked us up at 5pm to take us to the cruise port. Just to be clear. It is ONE room, open to any guest who requests its use. Chances are you won't be alone. So, those are all the reasons why this should have been a better-than-average review. Now here's my reason for my less-than-average review of our experience at the Park Shore Waikiki. And this didn't happen until I checked out. It was only then that I was informed that I owed (you guessed it . . .) $20.94 to pay for an activities fee. Let's backtrack. I had paid in full when I made my on-line booking and there was NO mention of an activities fee included on the reservation form. Instead, the fee was tacked on at the end of our stay as an extra added expense, after I had budgeted and already spent what I planned to spend on lodging. I was told by the girl who checked me out (I didn't get her name) that it is a (paraphrasing) 'DAILY charge that is mandatory for all guests. No ifs, ands or buts. And all the other hotels on the island charge the fee. Sorry, no waiver on the fee.' I was briskly handed a piece of paper and asked (told) to sign it as acknowledgement of the fee. I was not happy at that moment and vocalized that, asking if it was a standard charge, why wasn't I told about it up front. She didn't have an answer for that and I questioned her again, which set off all the other guests around me (who were also checking out) and then everyone was talking and agreeing with me about the fee. It felt like I was about to set off a revolt, so I told the other guests that I was begrudgingly going to sign the paper, let it go and get on with my afternoon in Waikiki. And I did just that, put it out of my mind and enjoyed the rest of our day, using the Park Shore as our base for exploring the area. If I was told that I was going to be assessed this fee at check in, perhaps I wouldn't have felt so ripped off when I was told I had to pay it at check out and then asked to sign a paper agreeing to the fee. Also, when I reviewed my credit card purchases from my bank, I found that I had been charged the fee at 12:51am EST on the day I checked out. (That's 6:51pm the previous day, the day I checked in, Hawaiian time.) Since my card was charged the day before I was told about the fee and then signed the paper agreeing to the charge at checkout, I believe the hotel owes me a refund. Charging a fee before telling a person that they will be charged is deceptive, and I advise you to change the way you handle this fee with future customers. Please post a response with an email for Park Shore's manager so I can contact her or him about my situation. Advising me of the fee and asking me to sign for it AFTER you had already charged my credit card for the fee, on the previous day, are, I believe, grounds for a refund. So, other travelers be forewarned! Park Shore is essentially a nice, moderately-priced (by Waikiki pricing) place to stay. But you seriously will need to budget for that activities fee, and it will most definitely be charged to your account once you check in. And remember, it is a DAILY fee, so it will add up quickly if you stay for multiple days or weeks.

The room was spacious and the bed as amazingly comfortable. Balcony was cool and we had good air conditioning. Another excellent feature here is that the free wifi is fantastic, and you can use as much as you want. The pool and surrounding area was also good. Now the negatives. Rooms are a little run down, this is especially noticeable in the bathroom. The service desk could be more friendlier. The location could be an issue with some as it is at the end of Waikiki beach near Honolulu Zoo and away from all of the main shopping, although this could also be seen as a positive. Also, guests at other hotels were able to get on the pink line bus for free which is great to get around, if you stay here you can only use the aqua shuttle which isn't nearly as good.

Rooms could be updated and a little bigger. Not much room between the beds. Would stay here again. We wish the pool hours were longer. After a long day, would have been nice to be able to take a swim when we got back to our room. Otherwise it was nice. Great location. You can not smoke in the room or on the balcony so would have to go out to the smoking area outside the hotel where homeless people would sit and try to bum cigarettes from you and if you don't give them one they would get mad and yell at you. Was really annoying when they can hang out by the hotel. My mom got matches thrown at her because she wouldn't give a homeless man a cigarette. This part was very annoying and frustrating.

Important words - 'in its price range'! Park Shore doesn't have the tariffs that some of the beachside 5star places do and accordingly, I don't think it pretends to compare itself with them. It is fantastic value for money and I suggest you look for the 'Special' offers - we were lucky enough to get a great deal here.Anyway, the hotel. Very welcoming staff to greet you each time you enter the lobby without being overbearing. Nicely appointed lobby with plenty of lounges, fruit juice available, all the tourist info (including an agent) and access to the ABC store (one on every corner in Waikiki).Our room was outstanding, balcony and windows overlooking the beach and the adjacent zoo presented a beautiful passing parade all day and night. The level of cleanliness in the room was fantastic with room service being unobtrusive and very accommodating to our schedule. Room size was good and furnishings were excellent. Enormous range of TV channels available.The pool and pool area was adequate and appreciated and not overdone like many others. Plenty of lounges and tables to use, probably the only thing missing here were access to a shop to buy drinks & food due to the pool not being on the ground floor.Proximity to, well, everything Waikiki has to offer is fantastic and the city has plenty to offer in terms of public transport that lots of other cities could learn from. The hotel is over the road from an amazing beachside which seems to have something happening all the time if that's what your looking for, or plenty of quiet places if not (crowds excepted).All in all, thoroughly recommended and I would return in a moment to Park Shore.

The coffee was surprisingly good for a hotel. We tried to eat breakfast in our room (the fridge came in handy), so the coffee was definitely appreciated! The pool deck was plain but nice, and the use of the beach chairs came in handy. We did morning yoga once, and it was great. Beachfront yoga with a very good instructor--what's not to like?The one main drawback is that in our room we got a pair of double beds instead of a king, which for a week was a bit of a pain. The gentleman that checked us in was apologetic, and I'm pretty sure he put us in a better location & higher floor than our booking was to compensate. We ended up having a partial ocean view. The rooms are small, but we were expecting this, so it wasn't an issue. The one thing I will say is that calling this a boutique hotel is stretching the definition; this hotel is neither small, luxurious, or independent. It is, however, a very nice hotel part of a larger chain.","Winnipeg, Canada","WpgLeah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",40,4.0

When I arrived and realized that the oceanfront rooms are accessed from external entryways, I decided I would prefer to not have a room with this type of entry. The front desk gentleman was kind enough to find me an ocean view. The view was diamond head with an ocean view out the side window and from the lanai, really nice, perfect corner room, but the cost should have been adjusted to reflect the room change. The lanai, though not large, is perfect for two, but the lanai chairs are not comfortable. Pool area really nice, clean, well maintained pool. A different system needs to be integrated for the towel check out since it's the front desk so if the check in line is long, you're just standing waiting to pick up a towel and it could take a while. Here's the rub - at the end of my 3-day stay, I scheduled an in-room massage with the Spa the hotel promotes. The front desk was aware of this, and the masseuse checks in with them prior to coming to the guest room - I like that process. BUT - the hotel was having work done and within 15 minutes into my 60 minute massage, there was a scaffold outside my window with two men on it drilling into the wall above my unit. Soooooo, not only was I unable to enjoy my view during the massage having the draw the drapes, but the work caused my room to shake and the drilling had to have been over the allowed decibels one should hear without earplugs! I took a photo of the scaffold outside my window and showed the desk - they did nothing but apologize - ok wait, I just spend alot of money on a service promoted by the hotel that more than likely receives a commission since the service is charged to the room, and I was not at least offered a partial refund? The hotel staff was surely aware of this work ahead and should have offered a different suite for the massage. The only work guests were made aware of was a fire alarm test (the day before) and sidewalk work directly in front. Nothing about what felt like shoring! I waited a month to see if the update to the cost was made from oceanfront to ocean view and if perhaps they would provide a partial refund to the massage. Neither, i was charged fully for a room type I did not receive and a service that was disrupted by the hotel itself. I have since sent an email and three weeks later, not even an acknowledgement. So I am disappointed to say the least - the hotel staff were all very helpful and friendly otherwise, and I would hope that this type of complaint was escalated to management. I was so impressed by my first visit, I recommend this hotel to anyone, but this visit just soured the taste for me, which is too bad because it could have been corrected by now. Interesting thing, for the location, the cost, the service [aside from this experience] is really good. Disappointing that I may not return due to lack of acknowledgement.","Toronto, Canada","pebblelake</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",104,3.0

The staff were very helpful and explained everything that needed to be. We then made our way up to our room (1508), which was a standard sized hotel room. We had 2 double beds (which were classic Australian doubles – 137cm x 187cm). They were big enough for 2 adults, but without a lot of space to move around during the night. The rooms have all of the basics; mini fridge (no freezer), laptop safe, coffee machine & mugs, desk, large flat screen TV, plenty of storage for your clothes, and self-controlled air-conditioning.Every room has a balcony and nice views of either the city, Diamond Head or the ocean, depending which one you booked. We booked a partial ocean view and it didn’t disappoint. Our balcony faced the hotel next door, with a partial view of Kuhio beach. Our room was at the end of the hallway, so we had an extra window along the side wall – which had stunning views of the beach! It would’ve made it just that much better if the window opened, but I can see that could be an OH&S issue.We did have a bit of an issue with our air-conditioner unit – we had to leave it on 25 degrees Celsius otherwise it would be freezing! Our front & balcony doors would also rattle at times – I’m guessing this was every time a gust of wind blew past – and it did get pretty annoying, but you kind of get use to it.The hotel offers free wifi, which I found really fast most of the time, although slows down in peak times. There’s no password required, just connect once you’re in the lobby/rooms.The bathroom was quite large with plenty of bench space, although quite low for the average person. The shower is over the bath and only had one setting as far as pressure goes, but it was really nice. I did manage to have a bath one night, but the water kept draining to half-full as the overflow valve was half way up the bathtub. I found this really odd, but it wasn’t nay fault of the hotels, just the manufacturer.The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to and from the Ala Moana shopping center operating every 40 minutes. They also offer daily use of their beach towels and beach chairs – both of these are included in the hospitality fee.I’d highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay in Waikiki, especially if you have an interest in visiting the Zoo (across the road) or Aquarium (a short walk along the beach).",,jaxiipoo,27,4.0

The room was generous in size with a good size balcony & bathroom. I loved the extra views which also took in Diamond Head from the side windows. (Unobstructed views).

Facilities- Starbucks next door , lulu's bar , deli , 2 ABC shops for grog & food , Yoshitune Japanese restaurant , swimming pool , tour desk, & water sport rentals.

The hotel provides beach towels and beach chairs free of charge but I was warned not to lose my room card as it incurred a fee of $20. I paid extra for a room overlooking the ocean (an Ocean Front room, not an Ocean View room, which has a side window overlooking the ocean and a balcony overlooking the road) and I thought it was worth the extra. My deal included breakfast for which you're given vouchers for the hotel restaurants - a Japanese restaurant, a 'picnic' cafe (Tucker and Bevvy), and Lulu's, which is an American style bar/restaurant with a young, lively beach vibe. The vouchers give strict set meals and I was slightly disappointed not to be able to choose from a regular buffet style breakfast. The room was large, with a decent size balcony, good air conditioning and a coffee maker (though I had to ask for a kettle and tea bags) but this is not a luxury hotel. The room furnishings and bedding were only adequate, with the bare minimum of basic toiletries (soap, shower gel - not replaced, shampoo and conditioner) provided so don't expect luxuries like robes or slippers.

Also no traffic noise unlike ones higher up.The other great thing about Level 3 is that there is a room just off the poolside with a table chairs and micro- wave - so great place to make your own breakfast - if you are like us and just want cereal. toast and tea/coffee.

The hotel is beautiful and perfectly located. The room was very nice too as we opted for the partial ocean view and had a nice view of the ocean and Diamond Head.While we really liked the location, there were a few aspects we didn't like. On top of the room charges, you have to pay for parking and for a ""convenience"" fee. This was an additional $47. For this price you have someone valet you car and bring your suitcases up to your room. This sounds nice, but this is not what we are used to and all of this became more of a nuisance than anything else.As soon as we arrived, we were approached by 2 valet members wanting to help with our luggage and take the car away. After having spent a few days on the road, our car was a mess with stuff all over. We told them we needed some time to get organized, but they were breathing down our necks the whole time. So, we eventually piled everything on the luggage cart, hoping nothing was going to fall off from it. After checking in, we were ready to bring the cart upstairs ourselves, but were told it would be brought for us.We went up to our room to find out the maid was in the middle of cleaning it. She was very surprised we had been given this room since obviously it wasn't ready... She was very apologetic and worked as fast as possible. In order to stay out of her way, we first waited in the hallway. After 10 minutes or so, she asked if we wanted to go wait on the balcony as it was much nicer there. That's when we found out about the nice view! It made waiting for her to be done much more pleasant.About 20 minutes later all together, our room was ready. But in the meantime, no luggage...We had gone on a snorkeling tour earlier in the day, so we were in our swimming gear and really wanted to get into fresh clothes, but we couldn't... Waited a few more minutes, my wife called the lobby. They said the luggage was getting loaded onto a cart and brought up to us. She indicated that we had already loaded everything on a cart, so there was something goofy. We waited a little longer and eventually it all showed up. In the meantime it had been delivered to the wrong room, and had to be reloaded and brought to us. Surprisingly, nothing had been lost.So, all together, we liked the hotel for the location and the quality of the accommodation, but were disappointed with the level of service given that we had to pay extra for all of it, especially since we only spent one night, had arrived late in the afternoon, left early in the morning and couldn't use any of the services covered by the convenience fee, such as the pool, yoga, etc...","Kihei, Hawaii","JeromeB855</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kihei, Hawaii</strong>",37,3.0

Open from 7am-2am...you can enter Lulu's right through the 2nd floor of the hotel as well as the 2 street entrances. The pool area was clean and had a great view of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach. If you're looking for a nice, clean hotel at the quieter and less busy end of Waikiki, this is your place. For those that don't rent a car, the bus stops right out front...and if you use google maps for your destination, the routes and times of buses come up for you. The bus is only $2.50 and will take you almost anywhere of interest. Cheap and easy way to sight-see. We rented a car for 6 days of our stay and there is a $25 per day parking fee here at the hotel with valet parking services. We will definitely be back to visit and will stay here again. (As a nurse, in the service industry, I realize you can't please all the people all the time and that there will always be complainers. Some people are just miserable and impossible to please, so please don't take it to heart because I know how hard all of you work!) btw most reviews I read were excellent before I even booked this hotel.

Pros: Staff is great, coffee and punch available in nice big lobby much of the day, valet parking is convenient and available, beach literally steps away across the street, this is a very (relatively speaking) affordable option for beach-sited Waikiki hotel lodging. It is also pretty accessible to H1, the main interstate route into and out of downtown.Cons: Really have to think hard about this but it is not centrally located as far as ""central"" Waikiki (you'll pay more in every way to be there), so you may have some walking or traveling to do to access destinations in the center or the far side of Waikiki. Still even here, you have probably nearly a dozen eating options within two blocks, at least twice that many options within 4-5 blocks. Many of the upscale hotels have their own complexes with multiple great restaurants within and those might be a few blocks further away.Really, I have no complaints, there's no denying that Honolulu is an expensive destination.

The rooms are not large but they are perfect for me. The coffee in the room was really good! They have beach chairs and towels which made my beach time even better.

Pictures make the room seem bigger than it actually is. Dark carpet. Curtains wrinkled. Food from previous room occupants on the floor. Lamps from the 1960s (literally, not a retro redo).I was also disappointed to learn of a $20 resport fee. Huh? Hotels charge ""resort"" fees now? It supposedly covers an 8 am yoga class and coffee. No, really. Then, $25 parking. The Hyatt Place next door has 1) free breakfast, 2) no resort fee, and 3) $20 parklng. Walking around the lively area filled with Westins, Holiday Inns, and Hiltons only magifies the fact that chain hotels really are better bargains sometimes (the Hyatt Place is the same price when you consider the additional costs). What a mistake I made here.There are definitely better options in this area. This budget hotel's got nothing on their big boys competitors. Just compare lobbies (this one smells of fish. I was almost run over one of the multiple cars parking on the sidewalk, which sometimes blocks the sidewalk and the front door entry). Or customer service (compared to the one here, e.g. very basic, generally unhelpful). For instance, I needed a spoon. I was told ""we don't have a kitchen, so we don't have a spoon."" Really?I called ahead to reserve an ocean view room and was told I'd have to pay an additional $50 per night. The ""standard"" room I paid for apparently means staring at a wall of windows in an adjoining building. When I checked in, I again asked if I could be upgraded if an ocean view room remained vacant (without paying extra). The front desk clerk laughed at me. Literally!The TV didn't work the first night. After three visits from maintenance (after 9pm), they said they had do continue their work during the next day. No offer to change rooms. No offer to waive/discount the ""resort fee"" for a TV that doesn't work. Nothing. nada.Basic, boring pool without any services not unlike the one in a friend's backyard (no, wait. She offers services).Basic means different things to different people. In this case, it verges on backpacker rustic. Even there, a cheaper and nicer hostel option is right behind us.

It's only a few minutes further walk up the road but still across the road from the beach. We had a great ocean view room on the 17th floor with great views of Diamond Head. We regularly sat on the balcony both day and night looking out at the beach and ocean as well as the Honolulu Zoo. We could see the flamingos and in the distance elephants. When our flight home was ""delayed"" (more like cancelled - that's another story) they gave us an excellent rate for a further nights accommodation in the same room. I was expecting to have to move rooms or even worse find accommodation somewhere else, but thankfully we didn't. The rooms are clean with modern fittings. The only complaint I have was as it was very windy during our stay, the howling wind up the hallway was constantly rattling our door and whistling into our room. This was easily fixed by shoving a folded-up piece of paper into the door to stop the movement. Free Wi-Fi was great to be able to access although it was slow at times, but hey, it was free, so can't complain too much. You can pay for faster Wi-Fi but if all you want it for is to check Facebook or email, its fine. All interactions with hotel staff were friendly and efficient. There is an ABC store on both sides of the hotel making it easy to grab a drink, snacks or some souvenirs. Starbucks is also just outside the hotel as well as Tucker & Bevvy who sell sandwiches etc, great if you want to take your lunch somewhere. The free shuttle bus to Ala Moana shopping centre is an excellent way to get to this fantastic shopping centre.

Boy, I did not know how bad Honolulu traffic was, if you are a Sydney-sider it is comparable or perhaps even worse in peak hour. It took us about an hour to get from the international airport to Park Shore and cost ~AUD$50 with appropriate tipping. It took us about the same time back to the airport to leave, unfortunately also in peak hour. However on our way back we organised a shuttle through the hotel which only costs US$14 per person. If I did it again, I would look to see if the hotel could organise the same shuttle to take you into town from the airport on the first day. The shuttle only had to make 2 very close-by stops for another 3 passengers and off it went, it was quite comfortable and spacious in the van.I'm really happy I chose to stay in this area. Its on the quieter side of the Waikiki strip - less people and in my opinion, better beach with a nice park and closer to the well rated restaurants.We swam in the beach across the road, next to the pier which had great fish as close as 1m from the shore, and it was attached to a nice shady park with facilities. I walked the whole length of Waikiki (takes about 30mins) and shade is hard to come by! The crowds also got thicker and thicker as you approached the other end where all the big hotel resorts were. In terms of food, we had great burgers just a few doors down at Teddy's Bigger Burgers, and nice pizza at an Italian restaurant 2 blocks away. There is an ABC store downstairs and a Starbucks as well.The Room. I booked a twin room with no view at about US$260, which was in our price range. The room was very comfortable - the pillows were not too firm, the shower pressure was good with nice hot water and it was quiet for good sleep. I did not miss the view at all as the hotel was situated in such a good position you would just walk out for a swim anyway and come back to your room to rest. If you can afford the ocean view rooms I'm sure it would be beautiful though. The room was clean with modern decor.

The staff were very friendly and the check-in process was very easy.We booked an ocean view room and the view was very beautiful and the room was nice and big.There's one Japanese restaurant inside the hotel and the price is not bad compared to other restaurants around the area.The hotel is on the main road and is across the road from the beach and a 10 minute walk from the main area, such as The Cheesecake Factory.On the second day I woke up with bites on my arms, at first we thought it was something I ate but the next day my partner woke up with the same rashes and mine had gone worse.Thinking that it was bed bugs, we informed the reception and they had moved us to another room. Although it was still an ocean front room, it was not facing the ocean and we thought that our previous room was slightly bigger (maybe because the previous room was more open)The hotel took photos of our rashes and told us that it was the first time that this had happened. The manager came and spoke to us (which I thought was very professional) and he told us that they have tried to check for bed bugs but couldn't find any traces so they have called professional pest control people to have a look at it (told us that they'll let us know about the report)He also agreed to provide laundry service for us (the hotel normally doesn't provide this) and offered to take us to see the local GP.We decided to see our local GP back at home as we were leaving back to Sydney in couple of days anyway (when we went to our GP he told us it's bed bugs and that bed bugs are usually hard to see in naked eye)I give this hotel 4 stars for trying to go extra mile for their guests, however, we did not receive the report and at the end of the day we still woke up with those bites!","Sydney, Australia","915reginal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",40,4.0

It's not special but for the price (compared to other Waikiki hotels) we thought it was okay. We liked the location- at the very end of Waikiki Beach main drag. So with our rental car, I assume we avoided some congestion leaving the hotel to explore Honolulu. We hopefully avoided some noise from being more central on the drag. That being said... We did find it fairly noisy. Through the nite we could hear traffic and the odd rowdy group of people. Definitely woke up several times throughout nite. Also when we drove back into Waikiki from exploring the island, we had to fight traffic to get to hotel. There wasn't a direct route that would avoid some of the congestion we were hoping to avoid. One thing that surprised me was heavy police presence in area. I am not sure if that made me feel safer (wow look at all the police, I am so safe!!) or less safe (wow why are there so many police officers around all the time?!). Waikiki Beach is very busy and crowded. All the hotels on the drag/ strip are high rise buildings crowded together, packed, busy, noisy, tons of traffic. We only stayed a few days and used the hotel as a base to explore things on the island. We didn't even go down to Waikiki Beach once to use it! Went to other beaches. I used their free shuttle one night to Ala Moana Shopping centre. The trip was a little disappointing. About a half hour trip each way. The mall was just the regular stores I see all the time in other cities. I was hoping for a more ""Hawaii"" experience. We took a trip to Royal Hawaiian centre mall the next day and found some more interesting stores. If you want to do lots of shopping, I would get a hotel that is more central on the Waikiki drag/ strip area, close to one of the big shopping centres.This hotel is a good location to park, zoo and the aquarium. All within walking distance easily. On the main floor is a Starbucks. The restaurant Lulu they have attached to building is a great breakfast spot. We were glad to have a rental car to escape Waikiki every day! For at least a while! We did a trip to Hanauma Bay and Kuilima cove to snorkel; hiked the waterfall at Manoa (a highlight of our trip); did a Pirate Cruise mostly for our son's benefit; drove the entire east and north coast. Would we return here? Yes if the price was right. I would try to get a higher floor to reduce the noise at nite. One thing we really were impressed by was how fast the valet service was for the car. We came down probably 5 times each day, and every time got our vehicle within 5 minutes. Most likely if we return to Waikiki, we would stay at North Shore as a base instead of Waikiki. Somewhere away from crowds. And then just do a day trip to Waikiki to shop or explore. ","Sherwood Park, Canada","nicole c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sherwood Park, Canada</strong>",147,3.0

The hotel seems pretty tired and more than ready for a makeover. The lobby is ho-hum, although the front desk staff are friendly and helpful. Our room, was incredibly expensive at New Years, yet nothing special. We had asked for a single king bed, but were given a room with 2 queens. The room was so small that there was almost no free space. There were the 2 beds, a nightstand, and a dresser. No chair. The bathroom was fine, everything worked, and there were the basic amenities. We had virtually no view so there was no reason to sit on the balcony. The hotel was offering a 20% discount if you could show that you had cancelled at another Honolulu hotel for the same dates. Oddly enough, we had done just that, but the front desk would not give us the discount (even though we could prove it) because we had not declared that when we arrived. Things like that leave a bad taste. We were able to park close by for free (near the zoo) and save $25 per night. After the exorbitant price of the room, the bogus ""resort fee"" and taxes, we were happy to save a little cash. Overall, nice break on Oahu but the Park Shore wasn't the highlight.","Los Angeles, California","westwilshire</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",210,3.0

I think it was worth getting the Ocean view. It just makes the stay a little more special. We stayed in room 1407. It is a corner facing the Ocean--two different views in a window and a tiny balcony. So ask for the higher floors in the corner--it should end in 07 (1507, 1407, etc). Ask for the high floors and I really liked the location because it wasn't in the middle of the Waikiki upscale noise. Also ask for the renovated rooms. The rooms are ok, don't expect the most luxurious. They're kind of small, but typical of a beach house. Try to book as early as possible to get a good deal.

Champagne flutes, kettle & tea bags need to be requested. The resort/room tax charge is for amenities normally provided by other international hotels (but this is a standard charge by most Hawaiian hotels).

A quick check online confirmed that this was rubbish, still they must get everyone asking for upgrades. In the end they only charged us one night's resort fee - so that was a bonus.Our room was basic but clean and comfortable and faced another hotel, but you could see the sea from the balcony, and there were excellent views of Diamond Head from the space by the lift.

At the Diamond Head end of the beach it marks the end of the high rise strip and gives excellent access to a good beach and protected swimming area. But it is still within easy walking distance of the big hotels and best shops. We stayed for 8 nights in an Ocean Front room and the extra cost of this is well worth it. The views of the surf breaking in the morning when you first open the curtains are just outstanding. We were on the 8th floor and I wouldn't want to be much lower. Hotel staff were great in all areas especially housekeeping and front desk who were excellent in handling the frequent requests for clean towels to take to the pool or beach. This is a great service.For those who need gluten free food, it was very pleasing to find that the Tucker and Bevy shop on the ground floor had several choices including a nice gluten free bread which they were willing to use for sandwiches and paninis. The many ABC stores within a very short walking distance also provided many simple food choices including good salad and fruit choices, but they don't usually have tomatoes. Beer is cheap! The only thing I found strange was the difficulty in finding out how to dial another room number in the hotel. Usually this is printed on the phone itself but it seems that this was forgotten when the phone system was installed. I pointed this out to the manager at the weekly managers happy hour and he was also surprised at this oversight. Eventually we found that the details are printed on Page 15 of a near 200 page untitled coffee table style tourism book located in each room. And they are shown on the TV set if you can navigate to the hotel services page. I would never normally look at such sources to find this information so I would encourage the manager to to put a simple sticker on each room phone.

My husband and I stayed for 8 nights in a standard room on the 16th floor. We had a partial view of the ocean which was wonderful. The staff was excellent! Michelle at the front desk conviced me to switch and save. Look into that! We got a great rate by doing this. Michelle and Leny thank you for all your help and for making my vacation memorable! The hotel is in a good location at the end of busy waikiki and quiet. We walked from the hotel to Diamond head 2.5 miles from the hotel to the top of Diamond Head. The shuttle takes you to the mall and to other locations in waikiki. They also have an in house car rental which was awesome for us because we did not need it for the entire stay. The WiFi is free! We were looking for a nice place too stay but inexpensive and we found it. The also have suites which are nice and big if you want more space. People say thr pool is small but there is never anyone in it so you have it to yourself. No complaints from me. My husband and I stayed at the pool the entire day and had no issues. Everyone is at the beach. This is the hotel for those who want to explore hawaii and are looking for a standard room which is small but they have other options. Pictures on the website are exactly what you get. We had a wonderful time ecploring Oahu and paid little for our hotel. It does not have more than 1 restaurant in it but it is literally 100 restaurants on the strip so who cares.","New York City, New York","Shonda1066</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",12,4.0

Most hotel rooms that state that the beds are double size are usually queen size so I was a bit shocked to find two small double beds for our family of 3 adult size people!I returned to reception and asked what options were available for a larger room with different size beds. I was only offered one choice of which I reluctantly took (for an extra charge). The room had bigger beds but was very noisy with doors banging from early morning and the pool deck right outside the door. The next morning I could no longer stand the room and went back to reception. The girl was very helpful and gave me a further two choices, one of which was a king size corner room with room for a fold out bed. It was great and cheaper than the pool side option. We enjoyed the rest of our stay from that moment on. In fact we have stayed in Waikiki five times now and I would have to say that the Park Shore is the best place to stay. Breakfast at Lulus or Starbucks was great and the beach across the road was easily accessible. It was good value, friendly staff and the shuttle to Alamoana was also great.

While it is a little further out to other parts of Waikiki and Honolulu, we really were within walking distance to everything we needed. The beach is literally a couple hundred feet outside the front door, and the beach here was much less busy than beaches a few blocks away. The zoo and a large park are also across the street, giving lots of space to stretch out and enjoy some quieter time. Great routes for running in the morning. Lots of good local places (Leonards, Rainbow Drive In, local coffee shops) within walking distance of this hotel as well. If you are able, pay a little extra for a view. I don't normally say this, but it is worth it. All staff was very friendly and helpful the five days we were there, and the free Wi-Fi worked great. The only things that kept this from being a five star review were little things like limited hours for the pool (not open after dark, rarely opened before 9 am) and very minor tired edges around the hotel.

The hotel is located at the very end of Waikiki Beach's strip of hotels, so the surrounding noise level is greatly reduced (versus other Waikiki hotels). The location is excellent in that it is only one of three hotels in Waikiki that has no major buildings between your balcony view and Diamond Head. It's only steps away from the Honolulu Zoo (located right across the street). You are close to everything - the beach, restaurants, shopping and the Honolulu Aquarium. There is an ABC store located in the hotel, as well as another ABC Store located about a 30 second walk from their front door. Lulu's Bar & Grill is open-air (with air conditioning) and located on the second floor of the hotel and offers good food, good prices and great views of the ocean and Diamond Head. Regarding their rooms, as with most all of the HNL hotels - you get what you pay for, so if you book a standard room with ""partial ocean view,"" that's what you're going to get. However, if your dream room is of the ocean, then book and pay for an ocean view room and you will be very happy because you will get both ocean and Diamond Head views; Oceanfront gives you spectacular ocean views. The hotel is clean, the rooms are pretty well updated, the staff is very nice and accommodating and price compared to most decent Waikiki hotels is good.

I was looking forward to experiencing all the great things about the hotel. We stayed from August 7-13. First, I will talk about the positives. As many have stated before, the location of the hotel is excellent being on the far western side of Waikiki. It is a little quieter than other parts of Waikiki. Most rooms have excellent views of the ocean. My wife and grandson really enjoyed the pool and pool deck. The room we had was clean, and well decorated. The deck was a decent size that could easily accommodate 4 people who want to sit and see the view and have a drink. The lobby of the hotel is large and nicely decorated. We enjoyed the coffee in the morning and the juice and water during the day. I would recommend that the hotel provide real milk or cream for the coffee. Using powdered creamer is not great. Go to the ABC store and buy a little real cream and keep it in your fridge to avoid this problem. I really liked the use of towels for the beach provided by the hotel.There are a few minor problems that should be mentioned, but should not affect your decision to stay. The elevators were a little slow. No big deal, but it is hard waiting 1-2 minutes for the elevator to arrive during busy times. Be aware that there is a $20 resort fee. This is annoying and I would rather pay a higher base rate for the hotel and not pay the resort fee. I think if the hotel advertised that they do not have a resort fee, they would have more happy travellers.Unfortunately, there were two serious problems that prevented me from giving this a 5 star review. First, when I arrived to the hotel, I found that they lost my reservation. This is confusing as I booked directly through the PARK Shore website. Also, I received an automated email from the hotel three days earlier about my reservation. They admitted that it was a clitch in their system. They honored my reservation after I provided proof, but this was incredibly stressful for me and my wife. I guess if you do book this hotel, please call several days before the day of arrival to personally confirm your reservation. An email confirmation is not enough obviously. The second major problem has to do with the hotel's room categorization. The hotel provides ocean front,ocean view, partial ocean and rooms with no view. Ocean view rooms face west towards Diamond head and also provide a great ocean view. The Ocean front rooms directly face the ocean. Ocean front rooms cost more. I decided that I would like the direct ocean front view and paid the higher price. The problem is that we were put on the 7 floor of a 13 floor building. Also, the room (721) was located closest to the Shore building so privacy was slightly infringed on. I paid the highest price and did not receive the full value for it. Any person who comes to this hotel will immediately see that corner rooms and higher story rooms are the best. What did I have to do to get one of those rooms considering I already paid the highest room rate? I should not have to call and beg for a great room. I want to pay the money and get the best room. At the very least, the Park Shore should make corner rooms a separate category of room and Ocean front rooms should be at least on the tenth floor or higher. If you are booking this hotel and getting a Ocean Front room, you are taking a risk and may not get the value you would hope for.I really wanted to give this hotel a 5 star review. There are many great things about this hotel, but the problems are serious and force me to only give a four star review.Good luck!","Surrey, Canada","Wenron</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Surrey, Canada</strong>",8,4.0

We had to call them twice to figure it out. It's probably the tiniest valet spot I've ever seen. Oh and it's $25/night mandatory too. When we finally arrived at the front desk (admittedly we were all a little cranky) but the front desk person barely greeted us. It was, ""Checking in?"" Followed by questions of are ""you are aware of our $20 daily hospitality fee right?"" I barely responded, before she was making me sign an agreement confirming it. I asked her what it includes and she handed me a document to review later. It basically covered pool towels and Internet, both of which I didn't need. Then she reminded me of the valet fees. I felt it was overkill and her delivery was poor. We got a partial ocean view room. The room was small and the balcony was awkwardly small especially when you step out and your neighbors are right there too. I feel everything about this place was minimal. Only one wall picture for the entire room. Just seemed more like a motel room experience and I'm glad we only stayed two nights. Other complaints, the front desk not once greeted us when we arrived in the building (any time of day) and twice in two days a bus parked in front of the tiny valet parking strip so we drove around and around each time till it moved. I was not happy about that. Really, the only positive thing I can say is the valet staff who were very nice each time and it's a great location. There's two convenience stores and a Starbucks next to or attached to the hotel. And the hotel is next door to the zoo and within walking distance of restaurants and other stores too. Our checkout didn't go smoothly either as they wanted us to return pool towel cards that we never received. I think maybe the guy was new because someone else had to step in to see that we declined the extra towels. The whole overall experience was not great and the next time we go I'll consider one of the many other hotels in the area.

I was given a room on the 8th floor of 18 floors. Yes, I could ""upgrade"" for $55 a night."" Huh? This defeats the purpose of using a discount site.3. My view was of another hotel some 50 feet away. Yes, I could look out on people drying their bathing suits and underwear on their lanais.4. There is a lanai, but you cannot sit out on it. It is too small and there are no chairs.5. Can you imagine a hotel room totally without a chair? This was the case. If you wanted to check your email, you had to sit on the edge of the bed. I asked for a chair and one was delivered but that was it. Not very comfortable.6. Worst of all is a failure by Hotwire and the hotel. When Hotwire tells you that you have gotten a great deal, they ignore the fact that they failed to tell you that the hotel will charge you $20 a night extra for 'resort fees."" $20 a night! This is a rip off that allows the hotel and Hotwire to deceive people into thinking they are getting a bargain when they are not. Shame on both!7.

Several other hotels with various rating were offered. We selected this one because it had a 4.3 out of 5 rating in the customer reviews and the location seemed to be ideal. Park Shore was an excellent choice. I strongly recommend for several reasons. Location was perfect. It is on the quieter end of the Waikiki Beach which is just a step out of the hotel and across the street. The hotel lobby area and the room decor was tastefully done. The hotel had such a nice warm feel,not so large that people were everywhere. The room was a bit on the smaller size but ample. It was well appointed with refrigerator, coffee maker, and safe. The entire staff was most hospitable. We paid for an ocean front room view room. I called ahead of time to ask to please give us a nice room as were celebrating our 50th anniversary and it was our first time to the island. Management made sure we had what I considered the best room in the hotel room -1607. Our view from the corner room was just awesome. From one set of windows we had Diamond Head mountains and a ocean view from the balcony. On the other corner window we had a complete view of Waikiki Beach. The balcony was large enough for us with two chairs and a table to comfortably.enjoy and watch sunrise and sunset. Our pleasant surprise was the bottle of champagne with two champagne glasses and a box of chocolate that arrived shortly after arriving to our room. Thanks so much to the night manager who checked back with us to see if everything was delivered and if we had any other need. On Wednesday we were invited to a afternoon meet and greet reception with management staff to see how stay was going or any suggestions we could offer for improvement. We were unable to attend because we had to catch the bus for our luau. It was just nice to be invited. Another great reason to stay here is that the hotel provides round trip transportation to the Ala Moana Mall. It really was convenient to have the ABC store adjacent to the hotel. Car rentals are also available right from the hotel site. The food was good at LuLu Grill upstairs over the ABC. Since we were on the 16th floor we didn't here any noise from the nightspot.Our stay at the Park Shore Hotel was really awesome.

The coastline views were wonderful with balconies that offered plenty ofshade throughout the day. The 'wow' factor remained off the chart for our entire stay.The rooms are on the small side, but are well appointed and there was plenty of storage space for a week's stay. The bed was comfortable and a large, wall mounted TV was a nice touch. The bathroom was small with only a shower, but the shower head was nice and the water pressure good. The single sink and counter were a bit low, but pleasing to the eye and clean. Housekeeping did an excellent job all week. Our room stayed lovely all week. The room had a small refrigerator and access to a microwave (pool level), so drinks and even boxes from restaurants can be managed. A coffeemaker is provided (we never used it), and the hotel provides fresh coffee in the lobby beginning around 7:00AM. Water and a tropical punch are available for guests in the lobby throughout the rest of the day. An ABC store entrance is off the lobby of the hotel making shopping for convenience items a snap (including liquor at reasonable prices). Lulus is a quaint, beachfront open air restaurant that can be accessed from the hotel's 2nd floor foyer. We enjoyed made to order breakfast at Lulus daily. There many eateries and shops of all kinds within walking distance of the Park Shore. Waikiki beach is at your disposal. Parking is a premium at the Park Shore. The hotel's driveway is tiny and on a busy corner which keeps the valet staff hustling, but they did a nice job of retrieving the car quickly and were always helpful at the curb.

The Park Shore Waikiki was the nicest hotel that was in my price range and by the beach. It's very basic, meaning no frills--room was tiny, bathroom cramped (hard to shave legs in), pretty sure no room service although a lot of local places deliver. The bathroom doesn't even have a proper locking door, just a pocket door. The lanai was nice (we splurged on an ocean view room), but was somewhat ruined by noise from the pool below (even though we were on the 15th floor) and from the beach across the street. the hotel in general was very LOUD. There's a fairly major road right there so you get traffic noise, including some really loud trucks at night. Then there's the beach noise--music, kids, etc. This is definitely not a hotel you come to for a relaxing retreat. Still great views from the ocean view lanai, though. And the staff was great and very helpful. Location is pretty ideal, right on the edge of Waikiki. It was still very touristy, crowded, and noisy, but at least on one side you had the park and the Honolulu Zoo, so you weren't surrounded on all sides by Waikiki craziness. There's a Starbucks literally steps away, which was great for breakfast--but keep in mind, the line was ALWAYS almost out the door, literally. Plan accordingly. There are two convenience stores, one on either side of the hotel! Tons of restaurants a short walk away. The beach is right there, easy to get to...just very crowded, but that's Waikiki for you. This is not a romantic hotel at all, just FYI. The room felt really cramped compared to the other two hotels we stayed at on this trip, and we were among the only guests without kids here. The pool is basically useless because it's overrun with small children, and their screams echo from the pool...so relaxing on your lanai is difficult, even from the 15th floor like I said! You also hear kids at the beach across the street (amazing how far sound travels). DEFINITELY don't get a lower-level room if you're trying to have a relaxing vacation. I would also avoid the third floor in particular because that's where the pool access is...so you'd have people constantly streaming by your room.The mandatory valet parking is annoying ($25/day) but it makes sense once you realize how crowded Waikiki is and how expensive parking is. I can't imagine what the hotel pays for the lot. The valets were always friendly and got the car pretty fast.This was a fine stay and was ""affordable"" by Waikiki standards. I am just used to bigger rooms I guess, and to hotels that aren't quite so family-friendly (nothing against kids of course, I just don't necessarily want to be outnumbered by them when I'm on vacation). Honestly, that's just Waikiki though--it's a mix between Disney World (with lots of families) and spring break (with lots of oiled- and liquored-up beachgoers). To be fair, we were there over the 4th, so I'm sure it was crazier than usual--the crowds did subside a little once the weekend passed, but the North Shore or other parts of Oahu were much more our speed. On a sidenote, definitely rent a car or you'll miss the magic of Oahu--there are so many gorgeous beaches, cliffs, and vistas--don't limit yourself to Waikiki!This hotel is fine, just a little cramped and dated, and definitely not quiet or relaxing. But I think you'll have to spend a fortune or just leave Waikiki altogether if you want that! It's a fine place to stay if you want to be close to the beach and shopping, restaurants, etc. Just don't expect a lot of space or peace and quiet and you'll be fine!",Connecticut,"scarlett_106</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Connecticut</strong>",68,3.0

Our room on the 12th floor with an ocean view was great. Even though you are across the street from the beach you are up so high you only sea the amazing surf out your balcony. We loved it. When I called to book two rooms I found out they have a two room suite not on their website. It was not only cheaper than two rooms but it had a really nice living room plus a small kitchen with a fridge and microwave. No place to really cook but was a nice surprise. The beds were nice and comfortable. The only issue was they didn't provide feather pillows as an option and the ones they had were too hard. I tried calling one day and the front desk said they never have them. After another night I decided to try again and escalate to management if I needed to. We loved this place and they had great service so it didn't make sense. Turned out that the next front desk person was more optimistic and was able to s rouge some up. Yeah! The bathrooms in each side were great and our master suite even had a bidet! The products were all nice and they were spacious enough although our master bath was much bigger than the standard double room our sons had.One night they had a reception with just chips and pretzels and punch but it was nice. Their pool is an ok size and they usually always had chairs available. There is no poolside service or jacuzzi. The interns worked everywhere without a hitch. We would have liked a gym but with e beach and walking paths so close we got plenty of exercise. This is a relatively small hotel with plenty of restaurants nearby. We at at Lulus next door 4 times for different meals. We loved their upstairs open views of the water.

It looked as if it were closed for ages . We were told that we’d rather get a van to get to the outdoors office . So , that is exactly what we did . A nice man helped us with the boring burocracy and we went to the hotel . Park Shore Waikiki is nicely placed , just in Waikiki beach . Our car was taken to the underground garage and we walked to the front desk . And --- I must warn you … If you do not take elevators because of claustrophobia like me … You have a problem … We were told that the use of stairs was difficult since the doors that led to them were locked . We were given the chance to tell anyone on the front desk whenever we needed . But finally I just made my best and sweating more than ever I could do it going in the elevator at least twice a day , one week long … . It is important and fair to say that I was given the chance to go upstairs and downstairs as often as I wanted . But I didn’t want to disturb the employees once and again .Breakfast is not included but never mind as you have a Starbucks next to the hotel where everybody queues since early .Waikiki beach is overcrowded with lots of people and orange/yellow sun umbrellas are scattered everywhere. Waikiki’s main road is a nice place to stroll . There , you will see almost everyone carrying their surf board all along the street when coming from the beach or when heading there . Awesome !Besides , you will see shops with the best brands ever . Though the humidity is very high I felt in Heaven … At midnight , having dinner at a nice restaurant , facing the waves with a light dress. Nice music …Waikiki , is ok but follow my piece of advice and discover the island . You will find virgin beaches with turquoise waters , amazing mountains with luxuriant vegetation , a difficult language with never ending words like ” Kamehamehai “ a former king in front of an official building . A statue in black with golden bonnet and clothes that will sound familiar to you as it appears in all episodes in “ Hawai-5.0 “ …Summarising , the hotel is a nice choice for a one- week trip with a perfect location and affordable prices",Spain,"Anaspain2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spain</strong>",22,3.0

We stayed in the 1 bedroom suite which was perfect for the two parents and 18 year old twins. Pros:1. Perfect location. Across the street from the beach and next to the zoo. Sitting on your balcony and being able to see green space and beach instead of high rises makes the the room the best in Waikiki. Diamond Head is the next tall structure east.2. In the building is an outstanding sports bar with ocean views, a very authentic Japanese restaurant, Starbucks and a very healthy breakfast/lunch takeout place. All the basics that are needed for a casual and affordable eating experience. Also the surfboard rental office is off the lobby as is the ABC.3. The 1 bedroom suite was renovated with a decent size fridge, a queen comfortable couch which the 18 year olds were fine with in the separate living room, and wonderful master bedroom. The bathroom was well appointed.4. Staff was very friendly to us and always helpful.5. They have a discounted rate at the 24 hour fitness which is 4 blocks away.6. Blackout drapes in both rooms. Amazingly many hotels lack this.Cons:1. Regular rooms are basic size and some have lackluster views. 2. No self parking.3. No fitness room in house.If you are looking for a comfortable well appointed hotel that has a boutique feel to it, then this is it.

There is no hotel or anything, or even a building with the number 2586 on Kalakaua avenue. Strong desire to present themselves as located on the most prestigious Kalakaua Ave forced the Park Shore owners to misrepresent their true location, which is actually on Kapahulu Ave. From Kalakaua you need to turn on Kapahulu, pass the Starbucks and only then you will find youself at the entrance to the Park Shore hotel. Quite confusing.Misi at the check-in was very pleasant and helpful, checked me in quickly. My room on the 10th floor was small, but nice and very clean. Shower stall was tiny and reminded me of toilets on airplanes. The bed was comfy, the flat screen TV worked fine. All rooms have very small (yes, again this word: small!) balconies. They are too narrow to put even a single chair in it, so not much use of them. And the view was straight into the wall of another building, with a glance of the ocean visible on the left.The following morning, around 11 am, a fire alarm sounded, followed by a loud, harsh warning: ""FIRE! FIRE! Leave your room immediately! Do not use elevators! Climb the stairs down to the lobby!"" What a shock!!! The scary, stressful warning was repeated multiple times. I ran out of my room and started my 10-story descent down with my heart pounding badly (I am a 65 years old cancer patient, also suffering from a serious heart condition). In the lobby we were told that this was only a drill, that there's no fire. Really?! So I've paid $220+ per night, hoping to have a relaxing, comfortable stay, but instead suffered a stunning shock, was forced to run 10 stories down via a stairway, for no reason at all? (Don't tell me they wanted to teach their guests how to run down the stairs).I expressed my dismay to the management and was immediately offered an apology and a promise to refund one night stay to me. They claimed a flier with the information about the upcoming fire drill was distributed to all occupied rooms, but in reality it was shoved under my room's door only about 10 minutes after I returned to my room from the outrageous ""drill"". Why then still 4 stars? Well, I really received their promised refund in a couple of days, seemingly managed to recover from all that stress. All employees were very nice to me.

We booked an Ocean Front room with king bed through West Jet Vacations. We arrived near 11pm after a long day of travelling from Toronto and were told we were assigned an Ocean Front with 2 queen beds (room 921). Apparently it is hotel policy that bed types within a room category are not guaranteed (if this was mentioned on the West Jet site it must have been in tiny print and the photos were of king size beds). We were offered an ""upgrade"" to the Diamond Head suite with one queen bed - but this only had a partial ocean view and a queen isn't really comfortable for sharing because my boyfriend is quite tall. So we stayed in 921 for the first night. This is ocean front but the L shape of the building meant we could see directly into the opposite rooms! This room was also very noisy from the bar downstairs (apparently only on Mondays). Luckily, Dylan (I think?) on the front desk demonstrated creative thinking and great customer service and switched us to a king ocean front room beginning our second night (1224). This room was AMAZING! Direct ocean front view with no obstruction, and a second window facing Diamond Head. The bed was comfortable, A/C worked well, room was clean and it was very convenient to have a mini-fridge in the room. In summary: Cons: -not guaranteed the bed type you choose-rooms even within the same price category vary wildly in view/privacy-no room service, but there is a flyer for ordering from external places-shower head is very low - it was uncomfortable for my boyfriend to wash his hairPros:-customer service - everyone we encountered was friendly and willing to do what they could to make our stay comfortable. For instance, we left a small bottle of milk in the fridge when we changed rooms and housekeeping found it, located our new room and delivered it-quieter end of Waikiki; beach was never busy","Toronto, Canada","lolajane22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",15,4.0

Located at just the end of the strip, the area was quiet and absolutely beautiful. We chose an ocean-view room with a lanai. We had a view of Diamond Head volcano and the ocean. We slept with the sliding glass door open every night and all we heard was an occasional car going by and the tranquil sounds of the ocean waves breaking. Staff are very friendly. You really do feel like you are staying at your ""cousin's"" house. Room was not very large, but in a location like that, the only time we were in our room was to shower, change and sleep. I don't think we ever even turned on the TV. There was always a nice breeze. The lobby was open and inviting. Great all natural restaurant just downstairs (Tucker & Bevvy) with great staff and the most delicious smoothies and healthy snacks. The ABC store for all of your needs was just steps away. Honolulu Zoo is just across the street. The restaurant adjacent (Lulu's) to the hotel was always delicious. We would sit at the table overlooking the ocean and eat breakfast every morning. By Day 3, they would tell us what we were ordering...loved that! This is a perfect place to stay and has everything you would want for a hotel in Hawaiian paradise.

There is a bus stop directly outside which can take you to Ala Moana or even to the cruise ship port or airport (although you apparently aren't allowed to take suitcases on it). The included shuttle to Ala Moana was OK but very circuitous and irregular, stopping at several other hotels along the way - I would rather catch the public bus. The room was fine - showing age but clean and functional. The staff were helpful and the in-room included wi-fi worked well.

It's at the quieter end of wakkiki beach which to be honest is nice , visited the start of May and the beaches were pretty quiet ,weather was lovely as are the people on the island . The room we had was small but adequate and the view which they said was partial was stunning and you could not ask for more . When ever we enquired about anything they were always eager to help and even let us phone a limo company on their phone as I could not get thro on my UK mobile . Morning there was fresh coffee in the lobby , then after 11 to 7 pm a nice punch drink or lemon water on tap ,all included there is free wifi , altho you have a $20 a day tax added to your bill which is basically a tourist tax , you also get free towel and drop off and beach chairs to cross over to the road which is nice . Lulus restaurant is attached to the side and turned out to be a gem of a place for either breakfast , lunch , dinner or drinks or all . We booked pearl harbour trip in the lobby down stairs and was the going rate and I advise anyone visiting the island to do it it, it's a very moving experience . I hope this helps you if you are thinking or looking at booking I always try to give a honest review as I would like to read the same when I'm looking to book .",bristol,"thefoxesbristol</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>bristol</strong>",53,5.0

Let me begin with the staff, prior to our arrival I reached out to to hotel to request a possible upgrade to make our stay even more memorable. Not only did I received a reply within 24hrs, the upgrade itself was complimentary. This level of service continued on from the moment we check in until we departed. I must say that this location is perfectly suited for anyone renting a car during their stay, if you ask me this is a MUST.

We stayed in a sea facing suite and before our arrival we asked to be on a high floor which was accommodated without any issue. Staff were very helpful and friendly upon checkin and overall everyone was very polite and friendly. Unfortunately our stay had a couple of sour notes. We'd run short on smaller $ bills when we arrived so when our bags were taken to our room we weren't able to tip as much as we would normally. My husband handed over a few $ to the bellboy who helped us with our bags to our room, and was about to explain this and say we'd cat h him again later, but before he got a chance the bellboy was pretty rude and sarcastic about his tip...needless to say he didnt get anything else from us!! Room was spotless. Maid service superb. The hotel is perfectly placed on the beach at the quieter end of the resort. We lovely that you could use the hotel's complimentary towels and chairs to chill out on the quieter beach area. Its also perfectly placed for enjoying the zoo and the aquarium. Visited both and would recommend. We didn't experience any real problems with noise. Cant recommend a sea view room enough - loved watching the sunsets on our balcony with a cocktail before heading out at night. Upon our departure we took advantage of the hotels secure room to store our cases snd the complimentary freshen-up room. The freshen-up room was very busy so if you plam to use this give yourself plenty of time to wait on your turn. Secure room for cases was helpful but on departure my husband accidentally left behind an expensive sweater Id bought him as an anniversary gift. It was sat in the room while he collected our cases and he forgot to pick it up. When I contacted the hotel to organise it being sent on they advised it wasn't in the secure room, which I found disappointing as the room is secure and I'd not have expected another guest or staff to take something that wasnt their property. Obviously dont know what happened to the sweater but I think it would be good for the hotel to have looked into this further than they did.

A MASSIVE bonus is that it is right at the end of the hotels on the beach and thus has stunning views that are not blocked by any other hotels.

Our room is second column in from the ocean front and the only thing that could have made it even more perfect would have been for the bed to have been the other side of the room - so facing the ocean - but that's just a small thing and down to pot luck (the rooms alternate in terms of which side the bed is on) and certainly does not ruin the experience!The hotel staff are fabulous, the Manager holds poolside receptions so that he can actually TALK to his guests (I have NEVER known this happen anywhere else we've been!) and nothing is too much trouble.The hotel provides towels to take to the beach or pool, sand seats for the beach, body boards to play on, and beach umbrellas.

Located right opposite the park, and Waikiki shore (hence the name 'Park Shore') this hotel offers something quite different from the crowded resorts along the shoreline.It's nestled right on the corner of the end of the main strip, opposite Waikiki Beach and is a much quieter and relaxed area of Waikiki. It is the quintessential Hawaiian resort, with it's high rise building, central lagoon style pool and endless balcony views. I loved the little touch of authentic Hawaiian music playing in the rooms. It was so comforting and reminded you that yes, this is paradise.The rooms are very spacious and quite luxourious. We were staying during a quiet period and I was so excited when they upgraded us to an ocean view! We were able to watch the volleyballers competing on the beach and admire the stunning Diamond Head crater from our balcony.I'm not the type to just hang out in the hotel all day when I'm in a place like Hawaii, but this hotel was certainly the one place that made me want to chill here for a while. We had planned on eating lunch on the beach, but once we saw our view from the balcony we set up and had a picnic there instead. Pretty awesome, I'm telling you.The bed is ridiculously comfortable and the bathroom is bright and spacious. There is a great little minibar area with coffee maker and a sizeable fridge to store any treats you've brought with you, including the ingredients you might need for a tropical cocktail by the pool.We teamed our one night stay with a visit to Lulu's Surfclub which is accessible through the lobby of the hotel. We got there just in time to watch the beautiful sunset along the front of the restaurant over cocktails. It might seem cliche everywhere else, but in Hawaii, the tropical experience is authentic. Palm trees, ocean, cocktails, sunset. Perfect.The hotel amenities are excellent and the staff let us start the check in process earlier than the official time by storing our luggage, letting us borrow beach towels for the day, and offering the computer services so we could check in for our flight and print our tickets in the lobby. It was all very easy and the concierge was fabulous.Valet parking is pretty much a necessity if you have a car and like all the resorts, it's not really cheap. $25 overnight, which seems to be the going rate. There is a big carpark at the park opposite but I'm not sure what the cost would be or if it's even available overnight. There isn't a lot of street parking available and we were warned about leaving your car with any valuables in it, so I'd rather just be safe by putting the car in the hotel's facilities.Park Shore is a beautiful resort in a quiet spot overlooking Waikiki beach. It's an easy walk to restaurants, shops and all the main things Waikiki has to offer.

No hotel restaurant, but connected by a corridor to Lulu's, a lovely seaside restaurant with good food, including breakfast. Price was good, too. It is on a busy corner, so can hear loud motorcycles and vehicles going by, but I used earplugs and it was fine.

I wanted to be as close to the beach as possible with a view of the ocean without spending a fortune. I may have received an upgrade at the nearby Marriott but I wanted a guaranteed great view for our last few nights in Hawaii so I went with an ocean front room at the Park Shore after reading all the good reviews here and other websites. Compared to similar rooms at other hotels it was much more reasonably priced. Yes it was small but I did not go to Honolulu to hang around the room. But it was very comfortable and had a roomy lanai where we could watch the sunset every evening before dinner. We also happened to be there for the end of the Honolulu Festival and could watch the parade and fireworks from our lanai.It is really the service that prompted me to write this review. As other reviewers have noted, the staff - front desk and bell service - are very helpful and friendly. Desiree made us feel very welcome when we checked in and Michelle gave us good advice during our stay. Being right across the road from the beach is a big plus and the hotel has some beach chairs you can use if you get them early enough. I would have preferred the pool temperature to be a bit warmer but it is refreshing if you get really hot sitting in the sun on the pool deck. Plenty of restaurants in the area you can walk to.My wife and I had a great stay and we would not hesitate to go back.","Delmar, New York","hooz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Delmar, New York</strong>",21,5.0

We've stayed several times in Waikiki at various places and this is our favorite. The hotel is on the edge of Queen Kapiolani Park, one of the largest and prettiest municipal parks in Honolulu, with a zoo, aquarium and miles of paths for strolling. A few minutes the other direction is downtown Waikiki. And across the street are two beaches, one open, the other sheltered and ideal for small children. Our room (1509) had a superb view of Diamond Head. We enjoyed several breakfasts and lunches at the casual restaurant / mini-market, Tucker & Bevvy, off the hotel lobby. And Lulu's Restaurant was a great spot for happy hour and dinner. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful, especially the concierge, who helped us arrange two great excursions. On the downside, the room and the pool were both on the small side, and rather plain.

I'll start with the cons of this location, but as you'll see it's a short list. Cons: Room size was pretty small with limited dresser space. I like to unpack and had to fill up our night stands with clothes in order to get everything out of the suitcase. Closet space was also limited.Light on frills. There was coffee in the lobby and it was delicious but they didn't even offer the little half and half containers. Instead they had little packets of non dairy creamer. Not very good. At the end of the Waikiki strip. This is both a pro and a con. The con of it is that it was kind of a hike to a lot of different restaurants, hotels and activities. Pros: Service. The service was truly beyond my expectations. Michelle at the front desk went out of her way more than once to provide us with excellent service. For example, I needed to print a coupon and asked if they had a business center. Michelle said that they did, but you had to pay for it and if it was just a one page thing I could email it to her to print. I emailed it to her and she printed it immediately. There was a problem with viewing the image on her screen however and the coupon hadn't printed. Rather than just saying, ""well, I tried,"" she fooled around with the settings on her computer until the image appeared and re-printed. I thought this was great. She also was very good about giving directions and making restaurant recommendations. We were there during the Honolulu parade and even McDonalds had a line out the door. We wanted to grab something close by without the wait and she thought for a moment and then suggested a fantastic restaurant that was kind of tucked away so was not busy. It was perfect! Finally, one day when we came back on a windy night, still damp from the beach she called us over and replaced our towels with dry ones so that we would be warm on the way up to our room. I really wasn't expecting such great service and was very pleased. Location - this hotel is right next door to the Honolulu zoo and directly across the street from the beach. Though the beach is a little rockier than some of the Waikiki beaches, you're only another couple of steps to other beaches. The bus stops right outside the hotel. There is an ABC store in the hotel as well as a cute little sandwich shop which also serves smoothies and juices. Cheeseburger is only two blocks away and has great happy hour specials. Though we were way at the end of the Waikiki strip and had to walk quite a ways when we visited other restaurants and beaches, we loved feeling like we were away from the major action at night. Cost - We got an amazing deal on this hotel - staying for 6 nights for only about $100/night. It was by far the most affordable hotel that close to the beach. We saved a ton of money. Because of this our room was just ""standard"" and the balcony was too small for a chair. Nevertheless, we were happy to see that when we were on the balcony and looked to our left we had a great ocean view! Manager's Reception - On Wednesdays, the hotel hosts a manager reception. It was fun to get to talk to some of the other guests and get a couple of drinks and snacks for free. David, the manager, was extremely friendly and even sent us home with some punch! Beds - I was so happy with our bed! I'm pretty spoiled by my bed at home and the last couple of hotels I've stayed at had pretty uncomfortable beds. I slept great on the King size bed. It was very comfy. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel and will probably stay here again the next time I'm in Oahu.",Tacoma,"lololives</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tacoma</strong>",32,4.0

The hotel is in a great position, at the end of the hotel area on Kalakaua Ave, which means that the quieter beach areas are accessible. The rooms have been refurbished and the beds are very comfortable. The service is erratic and check in disorganised. We reserved one king room and one double room but when we arrived were told that 2 double rooms had been booked. Despite arriving before 9 am, we had to wait until 3pm for check in. No flexibility was offered. We had different representations from different check in staff. The staff were friendly however. The concierge was a bit long winded and our room was not serviced.

I've stayed at this hotel several times and on the island many more. This is my favorite hotel on Waikiki strip. For the price, you cannot get a better hotel that is right on or directly across the street from the beach. Front desk receptionists like Jara continue to make my stays here exceptional. *JARA* went above and beyond many times for us during our trip. I believe standard rooms go for about $150-$250. Parking is $25-$30/day, as is usual for a hotel on the strip, so build this into your budget. It is only valet parking, and *VICTOR* is one of the friendliest valet people you will ever meet. If you can afford to get a partial view or full ocean view, I fully recommend it. The restaurant hotel is Club Lulu and it has great food. Starbucks and an ABC store are on the first floor. There is also a deli, surfboard school, and traditional sushi restaurant all connected to the lobby. Jamba juice is a football throw away as is Waikiki beach. From the pool, you are right next to palm trees, the Pacific Ocean, and the Honolulu Zoo. The Diamond Head creates the backdrop for your swim in the pool. The hotel is on the quieter side of Waikiki Beach, which we really enjoy. The whole strip is about a mile, so it is easy to walk anywhere. The nice part of this side of the beach is that there is a breaker wall which makes the beach front very kiddy-friendly; the breaker walls make the waves tranquil, the bottom sandy, and the temperature a tad-bit warmer. I believe you can get late check-out until 1pm and it's $10 for anytime after, which we may exercise this option today. They have complimentary pool towels and beach chairs. They invited us to a manager's reception in the pool area on Wednesday night, which we couldn't attend. They offered yoga one of the mornings in the park/beach.

Our room had a great view of the beach from the bedroom window with the lanai having a partial ocean view. Our room was a wheelchair accessible room so was very spacious. I would recommend asking for an accessible room particularly if you have booked a partial ocean view room as they are on the street front corner so you have a full ocean view from your bedroom window. The one negative about our room was that you could hear everything going on in the room next door through the inter-connecting door. The Park Shore's location cannot be beaten - it is at the quiet end of the beach but still a short walk to all of the action. The seawall in the beach directly opposite the hotel perfect for swimming. There is a bar called Tikis at the hotel next door which is a great place to unwind in the evening. The pool area is one of the best features of the hotel. The pool area was quiet and peaceful while we were there and being on the third floor it has amazing views out to the ocean, the park opposite and out to Diamond Head. The one negative is that the pool closes at sunset (approx 6.15pm while we were there) which is very early if you are out and about all day.

My wife, 2 year old son and I stayed for 13 nights, and my aunt/uncle, and parents stayed for 20 nights.We requested all to stay close together in the hotel. Because our room, and my parents room were both Ocean Front, we were located next to eachother. My parents room was 824, which was on the corner, so they had an Ocean Front room, as well as a view of Diamond Head. My aunt/uncle were also located on the 8th floor in a Partial Ocean View room and they loved it. Anyone with an Ocean Front room, I would recommend staying on a higher floor. Because there are rooms only on one side of the hallway, you can hear all the service vehicles in the morning backing up, or hearing the garbage trucks. We requested a lower floor due to having a young child, so we didn't want to be too high, so the little bit of noise didn't bother us.The rooms were nicely appointed and recently renovated. Mini fridge, safe, etc. Nothing was over the top, but it was comfortable. They supplied us with a crib for our son. Lobby is very nice, with free coffee and iced lemon water in the mornings, and then an iced punch, and iced lemon water in the afternoons. They have beach chairs and towels for you to use at the beach which is directly across the street.Front desk staff was always friendly and helpful. Every...I think it's Wednesday evening they had a managers reception at the pool, where they asked for feedback and suggestions, and provided punch and snacks which is a nice touch.Some of my feedback would be to enhance security. ie. I noticed other hotels, you need a room card to gain access to the elevator, which would be nice. Maintain your elevators better, as we had 2 break down in our 2 weeks at the hotel, and improve the pool area, as right now it's simply a pool. It would be nice to have a hot tub, and a pool bar serving drinks and food. This would keep guests at the pool, instead of going to other pool bars for happy hour.Oh, and location is great, immediately across the street from the beach, and the Zoo (took our son multiple times to the zoo), and a great location overall.Next time we are back in Waikiki (hopefully in 5 years), we will definitely be staying here again!Mahalo!","Winnipeg, Canada","wazzy24</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",22,4.0

I was booked for the Hilton Waikiki first, then moved here because of the great reviews and because the Hilton's pool had been shut down.First, the hotel is at the very edge of Kalakaua Ave, which is fantastic you are not too isolated from all the action, but not in the midst of all the noise either. The location is great also if you're driving because you don't have to fight through the traffic on Kalakaua everytime you leave the hotel.First, the hotel reception is quite grand, comfortable couches. The reception staff were very helpful and courteous. They gave us tips about what things to visit/activities to do, or where to get food for good prices, etc. I have to say that the elevators here are kind of slow sometimes, but that was ok. We were on vacation anyway.This is a 3 star hotel, and is in great shape. Our room had a clean bathroom, minifridge and a safe, spacious queen bed with clean linens. The linens were changed every 3 days I think. Each bedside had a lamp with 2 power outlets. We had partial ocean view which was great since we were able to see Diamond Head and the Ocean at the same time from our balcony. There is a pool in the hotel, but we never used it because the beach is literally 20 steps away. The AC worked great, but the weather was so awesome that we just slept with the balcony doors open.There is a food delivery service, but that is really unneeded as you are surrounded by many dining options. You can walk for 10 minutes into Diamond Head to go to Diamond Head Grill & Market or Ono Seafood, or walk west on Waikiki for many other more touristy options. Waikiki is lined with ABC stores and other supermarkets if you want to buy food and store it in your fridge as well.The beach is public access like all beaches on Honolulu and is almost never empty. You can take towels from the hotel to use at the beach then return them. Be sure not to lose your towels because there is a 30$ replacement fee. The beach is great for snorkeling, sunbathing, and surfing. There are phenomenal sunset views here too. If you are around on the third sunday of every month, there is the Kapiolani Artfest (http://www.gohawaii.com/en/events/waikiki-artfest/) in nearby Kapiolani Park if you want to buy some authentic Hawaiian art and/or crafted goods.I made the mistake of taking a taxi from the airport to here. If you call the hotel, they can get you a shuttle from the hotel to airport or vice versa for 13/person (much less than the 40 for a taxi).Overall, the hotel had great facilities, safe, well maintained and its location and views are probably one of its best charms.","Oakville, Canada","752fadya</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakville, Canada</strong>",58,4.0

Right at the edge of the strip, it's not down in the center of things, but that's a feature, not a flaw. It's a modest hotel with three star accommodations, but the staff this year was amazing. They were all just wonderful in every way, and I couldn't help but think they've had some training, because they were responsive and gracious with every request. The rooms were recently refurbished, but it's still not the Sheraton, so if you need that level of service this may not be the place for you. Lots of food options close by, Starbucks right outside the door, and the beach right across the street. I love the ""neighborhood"" and want to stay here every year. Also, check out the car rentals here before you go anywhere else.

Typically, we stay at any of the Category 6 and higher Marriotts or the Fairmont. This time, based on what was available for packages, I chose this location for the cleanliness rating, courteous service, quiet factor compared to all other touristy hotels, and proximity to waikiki beach.The value (worked out to less that $100 per person per night by booking Air Canada Vacation package 6 months in advance) for what we received was worth it. Our 210 square foot room (1208) was a corner suite with an unobstructed ocean view Juliette balcony and a spacious partial ocean view, partial mountain view facing the Aston Waikiki hotel. Bathroom is spacious and has plenty of counter space. On the 12th floor, the noise level from the Lulu bar below on a Saturday night is barely audible. Very peaceful. Toiletry amenities were very nice. Plenty of clean dresser drawers and a good size closet with luggage rack for storing your clothes. Yes, the balcony chairs are a bit dusty but I simply covered them with dollar store rain ponchos and that's where I hung our wet beachwear to dry overnight. The bedside lamps have two plug-ins each in case you like having mobile devices, readers, iPads, and such plugged in near your head. In the welcome material for your room, it states that linens are changed on every 3rd night of your stay. You can talk to housekeeping if you need other arrangements.We booked Scuba Diving (intro) and the Roberts Hawaii Pearl Harbour/North Shore day trip tour with the Expedia agent located in the lobby. She was very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful (as with all staff at Parkshore). They offer good rates but only take credit card. Coming from Canada, the exchange rate (1.22, currently) is bit of an owie but the discount via Expedia offsets and there is value. Don't forget to bring extra cash to tip your tour director/driver.Beach towels and beach chairs were plentiful and readily available when you exchanged your beach card. We also enjoyed the pool area which was never crowded; at most, 80% occupancy on any given day and perfect view of the beach without actually being on the beach.If you want hotel room service for food, there is none. However, there is a service available with a list of places that will delivery to your door for a small service charge. We never used this as there are endless number of places to eat within walking distance, and open very late to cater to tourists, and large american sized servings. We gave away our doggie bags to some of the homeless people sleeping near the beach. There aren't many, but a few who have been forced out of their homes by rising apartment rental rates.They don't cause any trouble to tourists, and their are daily outreach workers who help support them. A local police presence is also right on the beach.No gym, but there is a 24 hour fitness located 2 blocks away on the main strip. The hotel can provide a pass for $15, or you can buy a weekly pass at the gym for $69 which offers a locker and access to showers whenever you want. Great for cleaning off at the beach or storing your wallets/valuables.There is a no-charge in room safe that is easy to use, and mini-fridge below it. We shopped a few blocks inward at Food Pantry for ready made salads, cheese and crackers, for midday snacks. The hotel offers complimentary early morning coffee water and juice midday until early evening in the lobby. Bring your water bottle/coffee thermos and get your free refills there.We met the manager, Scott Pauli, at the one hour, pre-sunset meet and greet on Wednesday, on the pool deck. Staff pours alcoholic and non-alcoholic champagne punch and serves up light savoury treats (e.g., maui chips, pretzel mix) while the manager comes around to introduce himself, asks how your stay has been, and for your feedback. Our only comment was that we would like to see blue recycle bins in hotel rooms for plastic water bottles, newspapers, etc. The trash bins are small and the housekeeping staff have to manually sort through our garbage for recycling.I booked an Island Express shuttle via the hotel to take us back to the airport on friday night. It is $13 per person with cash collected at the end of your ride. Cheaper than the $35 flat rate fare that is usually offered by taxis. The shuttle is a 10 person-seating van and arrives in a timely fashion, on the :45 every hour provided that you book through concierge.Our check out time was at noon, so we stored our luggage, ambled about, relaxed at poolside, went out for one last dinner and sunset, and then waited a couple hours in the nice lobby to charge up our mobile devices. There is access to bathrooms and a hospitality suite so you can change back into winter clothing :)I would recommend this hotel to anyone who enjoys friendly service, a comfortable bed with nice view, clean towels and big bathroom, a ""quieter"" experience compared to other Waikiki hotels, and value for their money. The noise is everywhere as it is a major tourist hub and that can't be avoided unless you head away from Waikiki. To create the ""Fairmont"" type of indulgence, I booked a spa treatment at the Westin Moana Surfrider. It's a 10 minute walk away without the quadrupled hotel room bill. For eats, Tucker and Bevvy is convenient for a quick and nutritious smoothie, but Jamba Juice is a mere few feet away and always has coupons or a promotion (buy one get one free; check the star advertiser daily, or ask for a coupon when they provide samples). Starbucks is open until midnight, but if you walk further down 15 minutes to the main hub of activity, there are a couple artisanal coffee houses with better tasting lattes. Tips: The Saturday KCC (Kapiolani Community College) Farmer's Market is a 15 minute walk away, or you can catch a bus right outside the hotel. Worth it for the authentic Loco Moco and artisanal, locally made eats. Diamond Head, round-trip from hotel to crater and back on foot with a stop off at the park for Shave Ice and a burger is 2.5 hours. It's a 30 minute walk from the hotel to the no-charge US Army museum. You can take the bus back, but the walk along the beach with a stop off for dole whip or Honolulu Cookie sampling is worth it.Some reviewers commented that the rooms are not cleaned well, too small, too loud, bad view, not getting what they want, service unresponsive....first, you arrived safely in Waikiki. That should be a good start. You are steps away from a beautiful beach - that's the perfect view you should enjoy outside, and not from your window, although that is a plus. Ocean front is nice, but not necessary. If you want housekeeping to do more, talk to the manager any time, or at the wednesday reception and voice your concerns. If the balcony chairs are too dirty, ABC Stores are on every block for a 2 square mile radius, walking distance. Cover it down with a beach towel or plastic and then sit on it...or, perhaps use a small towel and wipe it down. Lots of things one can do to make their stay more enjoyable, but at it was, for us it was perfect.Thanks to the staff at Park Shore for helping make this trip so seamless and enjoyable.","Vancouver, Canada","oilking138</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",22,4.0

We had two rooms and both were comfortable with two double beds in each even though our room was supposed to have a king bed but more importantly suited our children as they shared a room. The beds were very good but the rooms were very compact. They both had a small balcony and if you turned your head to the left you could see the beach.We found the staff to be very courteous and helpful. As mentioned many times, the hotel is at the very end of the strip but that was fine as the noise levels were non-existent and it was still an easy stroll to Dukes Bar and The Royal Hawaiian. The other good thing about this hotel is that a lot of the tours appear to leave from the hotel next door which is the Queen Kapiolani so that was handy. Further, the hotel is right across the road from the beach where the fireworks were on New Years Eve. The fireworks were spectacular!We hired a car for the last day to see the rest of the island and took it to the airport when leaving for home. We were able to stop right in front of the hotel to load our luggage. We never saw the car park as the valet handled it the whole time.We ate breakfast at the bar in the hotel. Very good quality food. Shame it wasn't included in the price though as that would have been a nice touch.Would I stay here again?

We had a great stay in general. The views were amazing - of the beach and Diamond Head. Generally fairly quiet during the day because it's at the end of the strip. Room was a standard hotel room but comfortable enough. The only problem we had was the bar downstairs that played very loud music until 2 pm nearly every night. We were on floor 12 but we could still hear it like it was in the room next to us. I rang the desk to ask when it might start to slow down and they said 2 am. When we went to discuss other room options the next day the desk staff could have cared less and suggested we might like to try another hotel. At the end of the conversation I felt very frustrated and moved onto my next question which was about gym access. There is no gym there but I appreciated them giving us two free passes to the local gym. To the hotels credit, they did hold a drinks reception by the manager to gain feedback on how the hotel could improve their service but I didn't make it. I was on holidays. Besides that I felt I had already given my feedback. I would suggest the desk staff need training on how to address client concerns in a more engaging way and would ask the hotel to consider their target demographic. If it is going to have a night club going until 2 pm most nights, maybe they should market themselves as that kind of hotel so the rest of us who are not seeking that kind of holiday can go elsewhere.

Since it's a bit off the main shopping area of Waikiki, things are a bit quieter overall which we enjoyed.While the rooms were definitely updated (nice tiling, granite), the actual interior of the hotel has an older feeling. The doors are very heavy and almost slam shut on you while getting in and out.Didn't really spend time at the pool but did note that there's no lights in it so it's not open past dark and there's no hot tub.

The staff was very professional and courteous. Our suite was very roomy and comfortable, and had an amazing view of diamond head and a partial view of the beach. They provide towels and beach chairs. Since we had a late flight, they allowed us to stay a few extra hours after checkout for an additional $10, which I though was a great deal. The rooms were well kept and clean. The location is ideal. The beach across the street has a seawall which makes it great for families with little ones. It's right across from the Honolulu zoo and a short drive from diamond head. It's away from the crowds, and the noise, but also a very short walk from the shops and restaurants. Oh the premises, it's Lulu's cafe, which we thought was wonderful, and had more than a few meals there. The food is very good and it's inexpensive. The Japanese restaurant on the first floor is pricier, but had very authentic Japanese cuisine. I did a lot of research prior to booking this hotel and I can honestly say it's one of the best values in Waikiki. We ended up staying at the Marriott, which is one block down from the Park Shore, after our flight back home got canceled. I am a Marriott rewards member, but I am glad that we chose the Park Shore for our stay, as our experience at the Marriott did not compare. The Park Shore exceeded my expectations.

Lucky for us, every single one of the staff were really nice, super helpful and always wear a smile (this is before tipping!) - some even remembered us by name, how good is that?!The size of the room is on the small scale (esp if you compare it against those in Asia) but adequate for the 2.5 of us. The large King size bed occupied most of the floor space and the wardrobe was small enough to fit our 2x suitcases. The large TV with good cables selection kept us occupied during down time and the bathroom (with jet like shower head) was simply great. The room was clean and simple yet impeccable. Just a word of warning, if you are one of those who likes to sleep-in, try and find a room away from cleaner's amenities (ours was right next to it) as they start work early and there's not much soundproofing between rooms. Having said that, the cleaners were really nice and wears a big smile like everyone else.We didn't spend all that much time at the hotel pool as the beach is just a skip and hop from the front door of the hotel. The hotel provides free access to beach towels which is a welcoming touch, oh and free internet too (but don't expect super fast down/up-load)! There are plenty of simple, no-frills eatery and small shops around the hotel (e.g. Tucker & Bevvy, ABC Store, Starbucks, Lu Lu's, Jamba Juice, etc).Location of the hotel is perfect for us as we wanted somewhere away from the crowd - it is at the pointy end of the strip (literally) and across the road from the zoo (awesome zoo I might add). It's a bit of walk to the crowd centre (say, to Cheesecake Factory) but not difficult. All in all, we had an awesome stay and if there's two things we really have to pick on - 1) book a room away from cleaner's amenities and 2) the hotel scale is inaccurate (our luggage weighted at 29lb at the hotel vs. 26lb at the airport... we could have shopped more! lol)","Sydney, Australia","DonIsGood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",105,5.0

The disadvantage of the location is that there are less places within a short walk. The big advantage is that it is less crowded. The beach is the best of both worlds. To the right of the hotel, the beach is protected by a breakwater, so the waves are calmer and there are almost no coral reefs to accidentally kick. On the left is the raw ocean, with all the excitement of the massive waves, but with much more coral.All the staff was very helpful.Even the guy pushing the laundry basket went out of his way to press the elevator button.We kept in contact during our delayed flight and they kept our specially reserved room available for us.The hotel is big enough to have the standard amenities, but it is small enough where the desk and valet staff knew us after just two days.Bed – very comfortable – 4 pillows on the bedDesk to set up a laptopDue to the layout of the hotel, you can ‘accidentally’ see into other people’s rooms if they happen to leave their curtains open. The rooms nearest the center of the hotel (closer to the inside of the ‘L’ shape) are more vulnerable. The ones at the far end of the wings are harder to see into.Bathroom had all the needed items including a blow dryer. A really great shower head with consistent water pressure all the time.Hint #1 – Rooms ending in 24 have a great view facing Waikiki Beach and a side window with a beautiful unobstructed view of Diamond Head. None of the rooms have a full 180 degree view of the beach due to the layout of the hotel. But what view you have is awesome.Hint #2 – You can save a few bucks by parking in the zoo next door.

We loved everything about our stay at the hotel. When we booked our reservation, we had booked a room with a King bed. Unfortunately when we arrived late at night, they didn't have a room with a king bed and we were put into a room with double beds but the front desk agent immediately indicated that they were going to move us the following day. When we showed up the next morning to let them know we had packed up our stuff so we could move into our new room, the staff at the front desk immediately knew the situation and made the necessary arrangements and they did so with a smile. While both rooms were a little cozy, they were definitely comfortable. My husband and I have different preferences when it comes to beds and pillows and were pleasantly surprised that we both were very comfortable with the beds and pillows.The housekeeping staff did a great job always making sure our room was clean and fully stocked with the necessary toiletries and towels. The front desk and bell desk staff were always helpful with providing information and providing beach towels when we wanted them. The location of this property was great! We liked that the hotel was not in the midst of the hustle and bustle of the strip but was accessible to anything we wanted to do. While not right on the beach, it is right across road from the beach which makes the location very convenient for those that like to spend time in the sun and water. The property also has a nice pool on the third floor for those that don't want to deal with the sand. We really appreciated the hospitality suite that the hotel offers so that we could clean up before we left to catch our late night flight back home. Being able to shower after being out all day long before the long trip home was a nice touch. While it didn't matter to us because we weren't spending much time in the room, there are some rooms that don't have much a view or look into the hotel next door. Scott and David and all of their staff were always welcoming and ready to assist with any questions or requests with a smile. Mahalo for making our trip so memorable.

There is a bus stop almost immediately outside the entrance to the lobby which we used several times. So as far as location goes it's ideal.We paid a little extra for an Ocean Front room which I am very glad we did as the views we had from our room were fantastic.The room size was adequate, although larger rooms are always appreciated. We decided to unpack our suitcases into the furniture as there wasn't really space to leave two suitcases on the floor.The bathroom was on the small side with no bench top to speak of which meant we left our toiletries bag on the floor, no big deal but if you are the type who travels with your entire bathroom in a bag, you might struggle with this room. (see photos)The bedding was very comfortable and we both slept well our whole stay.We had read reviews saying that on Sunday and Monday nights, the noise from the bars downstairs (outside the hotel) can be heard in the rooms and we can vouch for that. The music went on until close to midnight and I didn't manage to get to sleep until after that. We were on the 14th floor so I feel sorry for anyone on a lower floor in this hotel or neighbouring hotels because it would drive you mad.The room had tea and coffee facilities but nothing else. A toaster would have been appreciated so that we didn't have to eat out for every meal.House keeping seemed to come at random times during the day. Some days we would come back at 10am to find the room cleaned, some days at 2pm they still hadn't been through.This room certainly wasn't cheap and I would say was okay in terms of value for money but I would be searching the web for the best prices for this hotel.Staff were always very friendly and helpful. Check-in and out was easy and hassle free and we were very lucky to be able to access our room much earlier than the 3pm standard check-in time which was very much appreciated.We would look at staying here again.","Sydney, Australia","David_K_Aus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",122,4.0

However a few weeks after we departed, I was contacted by the manager who indicated that we had not paid the balance of the bill and asked me to call them to arrange payment. This was despite the fact I was advised the balance would be taken off the card I had provided at check in. I reviewed the transactions on my card and not only had I paid, the hotel had charged me twice. I contacted the hotel to confirm this and asked that the funds were refunded to me. The manager indicated he would look into it and get back to me. This was in August and in November I have still not heard from the hotel despite numerous follow ups. I contacted my bank and they refunded the duplicate charge but it was quite a hassle and I was really disappointed with the lack of response from Park Shore management.

When we arrived, we asked to move up to get a better view and less noise. The front desk employee didn’t move us up much, but since it was our first time in Hawaii, she moved us from a Park room (view of either Diamond Head or the city) to a Shore room (view of the ocean). The view was absolutely fantastic – words really cannot describe it. Beautiful sunsets over the ocean from our balcony, and beautiful sunrises over Diamond Head from the outdoor pathway right outside our door. The customer service was very good. We were greeted upon arrival and given free juice (juice and water are always free in the lobby). Throughout the stay, everyone was very helpful. We were even invited to a managers’ reception at which some select guests were given free drinks (with alcohol, if you choose) and snacks, and they asked for our feedback. The location was great too – just a quick walk across the street and we were on the beach. From here, you can either walk down to the end of the Waikiki Wall for some great views, go right for a calm ocean with a breakwater, or go left for a more realistic ocean environment with no breakwater. They give free warm towels and chairs (don’t lose the towels or you’ll be charged a fee). Or if you’re in the mood for shopping, just don’t cross the street out of the hotel – walk West down Kalakaua. The room itself was clean and had a modern phone system, which was easy to use when the front desk left us messages. Housekeeping was great. The room even has a hair dryer, which might not seem like a big deal, but it was for us since our luggage was packed to the brim without one. Each room has a small refrigerator, as well as central air conditioning (or heating, not that you’d ever use that). There is a door on almost every balcony that will allow you to connect 2 rooms. There is a small but clean pool that the staff cleans every morning around 7:00. The rooms all have free WiFi.The BadMy biggest concern is probably that the beds are small. They advertise queens, but they are actually fulls. The pillows were not very comfortable. Also, there’s not much storage, nor many hooks to hang wet stuff on. The bathroom had a very low showerhead, but this is pretty standard in most hotels. The noise was pretty bad throughout the night. We could hear a lot coming from the ocean side, but even more from the city side, which I think was due to the fact that our door didn’t really seal very well. There is an ABC Store just outside the door (there’s one on just about every corner), which is great during the day, but noisy starting at about 4:00AM when they begin to restock. To be fair about the noise, this is probably the case with just about any hotel near Waikiki. Also, we were on the 5th floor and the noise would have been less were we higher up. One of the elevators was broken when we first arrived, but it was repaired and functioning perfectly within a few days. One of my biggest complaints about the cost is the fact that they nickel and dime you to connect to the Internet or print in the Business Center. Also, the parking charge is very high, even relative to other hotels in this area. It’s valet only. Also, there is a community microwave, and no washing machines/dryers, though they say you can get housekeeping to do your laundry, presumably for a fee (don’t know for sure as we didn’t use this service). The WiFi is slow, unreliable (the connection drops and sometimes won’t reconnect automatically), and, last but certainly not least, unsecured.",,eatttig,13,4.0

Arrived early due to only flight from home city arriving late morning. We were given a swipe card to a guest courtesy lounge while waiting for a room to be ready, which took three hours to be an hour after check in. While we were in there asleep (jet lagged after international flight), two other groups came in to use it too, it is a shared space, but was uncomfortable to be in such intimate surroundings (and sleeping) with strangers. We only got our room after I rang reception to follow up, goodness knows how long it had been ready for. That's a problem with arriving earlier than check in, I acknowledge that, but the hotel didn't seem that busy and full to have to wait three hours for the room to be cleaned once they knew we'd arrived, and they weren't pro-active in letting us know when it was ready.However, the worst was to come. My teenage daughter was alone in the room having a shower while we swam in the hotel pool. She had just got out of the shower when someone not only tried to open the door, but did open it - with a key card for the room! My daughter encountered them when they were standing IN OUR ROOM. Reception had issued new guests with a swipe key card FOR OUR OCCUPIED ROOM. We had already been there five days, it wasn't like it was a mistake on check out day. Thank goodness this newly arrived Japanese couple went back down to reception without incident to get another - unoccupied - room. To me, that is just totally unacceptable and dangerous. How does a hotel allocated an occupied room to new guests and provide access to that room?Reception didn't even call to follow up. I had to call when my daughter told me what had happened and go down and ask for new coded swipe cards for our room. It seemed no big deal to them. It was to us! We were worried about leaving our belongings in the room after that, lest more new guests ""check in"".My other comment would be about the room itself. We paid the extra for a Diamond Head ""suite"", and yes, it had a magnificent view of the beach and Diamond Head. However, to call it a suite is a stretch. There was a very small kitchenette - we either had to use the toaster or the kettle as neither could fit the space at the same time, there was a small bar fridge and a little sink - and nowhere to sit to eat our toast and coffee. There were three of us in the room - to eat you had to sit on the bed or the lounge (which stayed folded out as the second bed) with your plate on the low small coffee table. There were no chairs to sit on inside. There were two chairs on the small balcony (lanai) - when I called to ask for a third chair so we could all sit in the room or balcony, I was told no, only two chairs for the balcony, fire regulations. And there were no chairs inside. If you are going to market and sell at a premium a 'suite' with rooms to suit families, then the occupants should at least be able to sit together. The three of us could not, we had to take shifts in the chairs - or eat sitting in bed, not what we expected of a suite.On the positive side, the location is good, away from the hustle bustle and housekeeping staff did a good job. The noise from Lulu's and revellers on the street does travel up and kept us awake one night in particular (and we were on the second highest floor). My daughter was disconcerted by the comments of the homeless based outside the hotel as she walked past, but that's not the hotel's fault. The pool is good for cooling off but nothing fancy, the view is the best part.I would love to be able to give the hotel a better review because it is in a good location but I can't overlook the negatives of our experience, particularly having other guests being able to enter our room as a teenage girl just stepped out of the shower. She still has nightmares about what could have happened.","Sydney, Australia","Deb B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",9,3.0

Two weeks later, when I returned to Honolulu on the way home, I went to grab my iPhone charger and was told that nothing was found in that room the day I stayed. Sure, who doesn't wanna a spare iPhone 5/6 charger. Other than that, the hotel is really outdated. You can spend roughly the same money for a night at Marriott right across the street, and they do bump you up to an ocean view room free of charge if the hotel is not busy.

I requested an early check-in, which I understood may or may not be possible. When we arrived, 4 hours before the designated check-in time and 1 hour before the designated check-out time, we were told they would call my cell when a room opened up and that we could stash our luggage in their secure room in the meantime. Before we even got the opportunity to translate that conversation to the valet parking folks, a nice young man named Kevin had an early check-in and an upgraded room ready for us! It was such a relief and we truly appreciated his work to make this happen so quickly. I certainly didn't expect it. Because the hotel is located across the street from the zoo, park and aquarium, it has less of a busy feel. The room Kevin booked for us had a beach view and a view of Diamond Head. We had a third party with us for the day who was waiting for an evening flight back to the mainland. They provided us with a beach towel for her as well at no charge so we could all use the pool.

WE got it at a special rate and not sure its worth the full rack rate, but find me anywhere in Waikiki that isn’t overpriced. We did get upgraded to an ocean view (from partial view) but the view was still only partial. However the view was overlooking Diamond Head and we felt this was better than the ocean view any way, even though we couldn’t see the sunset from the room or balcony. We found most sunsets we were out and about any way. The Staff were friendly enough and there is an Expedia salesperson in the lobby area where you can book most activities for all your islands, but there is of course a small commission on that. Research and booking yourself through the local websites will save you 10-20% but convenient if you don’t have time to research and book everything yourself.

Check in was a breeze, I had requested 2 rooms that were close to each other prior to arriving and was given 2 rooms side by side on the 17th floor. Our view was that of another hotel and their balconies so the curtains were closed most of the time. Not sure what room we booked, I just took what they had on their website as this was a very busy week in Honolulu and many hotels were sold out.The rooms are clean but definitely on the small side. I'm usually used to at least having a desk and chair to do some work on the computer. The AC units work well and cool the room in seconds since the room is not large but they do run a little on the loud side when the fan kicks on. You'll be watching tv at normal volume and when the AC kicks on, you will have to turn the volume up.One thing that I noticed and mentioned to Scott the manager is that it seems that the room doors all have a lot of play in them once their closed. Every time someone on your floor closes their door, you will here a loud slam which can be annoying. I think a .10 piece of adhesive foam could do the trick. Scott mentioned that they are aware and are in the midst of replacing the door assemblies.The room was always cleaned well other than one day the attendant missed one garbage bin (not a big deal) Internet is free in all rooms but you get what you pay for. It's fast enough for checking email but anything more than that will seem to take forever. You can however opt to pay for a higher speed. I did notice though that I could pick up the wifi signal even at the beach and at the zoo across the street so perhaps the speed or lack of speed could be the result of others surfing on the open network.There is a Japanese restaurant in the lobby area , Lulu's which is on the second floor and is kinda attached to the hotel yet its not, and Tucker and Bevy, a Panini/Smoothy cafe. We ate at all except the Japanese and they did not disappoint. One thing that I did miss is a lobby lounge. I really enjoy larger lobbies with a bar and sometimes live music. You will not get that here.The pool area is not as small as I thought from what some other reviews said. There is no bar or anything though other than a vending machine on the same floor. Seriously though, We didn't see any point in using the pool when the beach is just steps away. This part of Waikiki beach has an artificial reef to block the waves and its the perfect depth for lounging around.I would say that the Park Shore is a solid no frills hotel that prides itself with great service and location. I love the fact that the beach is right across the street so we did find ourselves spending way more time at the beach than we normally do (we come to Waikiki every year) Would l like to see the Park Shore with a nice lounge and maybe a restaurant with room service? Absolutely but would that stop me from coming back, probably not. If your looking for something as close to the beach as possible without being on the beach, this hotel will work for you.

I let the desk staff know that I preferred to have my room done early & it made no difference, our room was made up around 3pm the next day. We were also in residence during hurricane Elissa. At no time did hotel management contact us to let us know what hurricane procedures we could expect, or need to follow. At one stage we asked at the front desk & the staff seemed surprised that we would want to know anything.

He then seemed quite annoyed, and said, well, my room had a window that faced the ocean, so it was ""Ocean Front"". I was not happy with this answer, but there were no other rooms available that night. After settling in, I grew to enjoy the Diamond Head facing room, but I still feel I was mislead by the hotel and charged for an ""Ocean Front"" room but given a cheaper ""Ocean View"" room. Ultimately, I decided that it didn't matter, and that I wouldn't let it affect my vacation. Again, the unobstructed view of Diamond Head was incredible, and I did grow to like it very much.The room seemed newly re-decorated (as stated) and did include a mini-fridge and free WiFi (slow). The room was on the small side, but big enough. Lulu's restaurant is located adjacent to the hotel, and we ate breakfast here 3 times during the week, and it is recommended. The beach to the south of the hotel is wonderful, with trees and grass behind the sandy beach. I never had any trouble finding a great spot with very few people on this section of the beach. The beaches in the middle of Waikiki are so crowded and loud, I was very happy to be on the south end of Waikiki.I did appreciate the wonderful recommendations of two of the front desk clerks, one I believe was named Linda and I regret I don't remember the other lady's name - they both seemed genuinely interested in offering helpful suggestions and made the effort to always greet us and make us feel welcome.I would stay here again, I would just be careful to make sure that I really did get the room type reserved and paid for.","San Francisco, California","marksocal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",50,4.0

Fabulous location - right across the road from the beach and minutes walk to good restaurants and there is an ABC in the building which is pretty handy. There is a bus stop just outside the door that takes you to Diamond head which is close by but beware the bus is not regular and you can be waiting for AGGGGGGGGEEEEESSS ( which is nothing to do with the hotel but good to know!).The staff were really friendly, the room was clean and when we stepped out on the lanai we had a nice view of the beach. Standing in our room we had a view of the building across from us but that didn't bother us in the slightest ( we didn't go to Hawaii to sit in our room!).We didn't hear any noise at all from the restaurant below at night.We checked in before lunch and our room was ready even though check in was at 3pm - completely awesome after a 9 hour flight!I think this hotel is very good value if you want to be close to the beach in Waikiki!",,superkayakgirl,44,4.0

We had a pool deck room which might not suit everyone but we loved it! Would be really nice for families with young children. Room was fine, really clean, with a small fridge which was very handy. Staff were really nice and very helpful. Booked a couple of trips with the expedia desk in the lobby lady was really helpful. Attended the managers pool deck gathering on Wednesday, what a nice touch. They spoke to everyone and asked how we were liking the hotel if we had any complaints etc. We thought this was a really good idea.

It's a good hotel, but not a great one.Upon check-in, we were told by a male staff member that we had 2 rooms with two double beds booked under our name. Surprised by this, we explained we'd only booked one room (there were only two of us, why would we need two rooms with two double beds each??), but he insisted that he had 2 listed on the computer and in not so many words, that it was not his problem and we would have to take it up with hotels.com who we had booked through. We were certainly not paying for a second room so we rang the company, who in turn rang the hotel and the issue got sorted. The check-in guy was quite unfriendly following this and we got the impression he held a certain disregard for us the remainder of our stay.I read on another review that no-one mentioned the 10% discount for Macy's on the back of the hotel room key card - this was also not mentioned to us, but fortunately we discovered it for ourselves early on in our stay.The room itself had free wi-fi and was a small to reasonable size, but did not have a lot of desk space to put things. The beds were comfy enough, the balcony only big enough for one person, with a lovely view of another hotel and its balconies, but with a snippet of ocean front. The toilet in the bathroom had the weakest flush ever - we had to call for maintenance late one night when it would not flush and was filling up with water. A plumber turned up not long later to fix this issue, though the power of the flush left a lot to be desired.The hotel has a small, quiet pool with a nice view of the beach, an ice machine, an ABC store attached, an activities & tour bookings desk, and is directly opposite Honolulu Zoo and a walk across the road to the beach. The location is great for the beach, shopping and restaurants.Don't bother bringing a beach towel. The hotel gives you a towel card and you can change your towel as needed at the front desk. Just be sure not to try and hand it to the concierge, who will step back and react in a repulsed manner. Instead, drop it in the chute over the counter as directed before receiving your fresh towel.Overall, it was an average stay - the room was quiet, the price is reasonable and the hotel is in a good location. But should it be rated number 9 out of 82 hotels in Honolulu? Probably not.","Sydney, Australia","St3phie7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",43,3.0

The hotel isn't far from the airport and most of the shuttle services would know this spot. We arrived really late but was warmly welcomed by the team at the front desk and bell services. There is a large lobby area and the couches were very comfy. In the mornings, we could always find a lightly flavoured juice and ice cold water available in the lobby as well. We had a partial ocean view room which was directly facing another hotel room's balcony (only negative point). The room was luxurious and the beds were comfy. All the necessary basics can be found in the room even free Wi-Fi! The hotel has a tiny swimming pool and a couple of restaurants but we never had time to use them. There are ABCs at every corner of the hotel (and all of Waikiki) plus a Starbucks right outside for that quick fixer upper. The best thing about this hotel has to be its location. Although it's right at the end of the strip next to the Honolulu Zoo, we loved that the beach right opposite was always empty; more space for everyone!

If you are traveling single, on business, with friends, or with family, there is everything here for you at your convenience. They have a lovely restaurant, LuLu's, which offers an Island/Asian/American cuisine. They even have a happy hour from 3-5 pm daily. Try the coconut shrimp for a taste of heaven. What sets this hotel apart from the others: new renovations, very comfy beds, excellent customer service, and one crosswalk between you and the most amazing beach in the world. Are you loaded down with beach toys and strollers? Not a problem. You're steps away from family beach time. Have an aching back you're trying to heal in the sun?(this was me)...no problem, you're maybe 20 steps from heaven. Literally. Want to go shopping? It's directly outside the hotel. Need some tylenol at midnight? Not a problem. Want to jump on a bus and go to the farmer's market or Diamond Head or even the North Shore? Right outside. Everything you need is a breath away.You can even take surfing lessons and book it in the lobby. No matter if this is a honeymoon, friend's trip or a staycation, you will love staying here. The amenities like the pool, eatery, valet parking and convenience to the beach are bonuses. The Honolulu Zoo is also directly across the street!So whisk your worries away by booking this hotel.

We stayed here 3 nights earlier this month and could not have been happier. i spent numerous hours researching all hotels in Waikiki. We had three goals: 1) Oceanfront View with balcony 2) decent price 3) good location. We got ALL three with this hotel and the staff was so friendly and helpful everynight of our stay. I was always greeted when we left and arrived back in the hotel everday and i made it a point to talk to the front desk staff who would always recommend places to go or try. Desiree was a memorable front desk member whose personality shined!This hotel has everything you need in the room which are remodeled. Our View was simply amazing with an unobstructed view of Diamond Head and a picturesque view of the Oceans Blue Water. The Waikiki Sunsets were unrivaled as we spent it on our very spacious balcony over a beer! It's fantastic. We were on the 21st floor and i would agree with everyone that the higher the better, and yes splurge a bit for an oceanfront room, you will not regret it! Image waking up everyday, turning over to the side, and seeing the ocean as far as eye could see. Almost like you were on a ship. It was amusing to see the other hotels i researched along the avenue and am glad i didnt reserve them because what they touted as oceanview was a side view facing the beach such as the Marriot and Hyatt for prices way higher than what i paid.We did not hit the pool although it seemed ok.. but why not just cross the street and be right on the beach itself and be sure to get the free beach towels they let you borrow at the front desk. There is a breaker divider along one side of the beach and open on the other. It's perfect for a non-swimmer like me to hangout and wade in the breaker reef section. The water was perfect and i could stand in it. It was like a private pool in the ocean with an unrivaled view of the city along the coast.The hotel has a connected ABC store that has everything you need and a Starbucks so it worked for me. Also stopped by Tucker and Bevvy for some sandwiches for the road.. Location location- This place really is still central to everything along Kalakua Ave.. everything within walking distance within a few blocks and i never felt unsafe as some had mentioned. Waikiki is a bustling loud city but you really do find some peace at Park Shore. Also the street to the side of the hotel led us to many places that were on our Foodie List!!- a few blocks from Leonards, Rainbow Drive In, Zippy's and even Alan Wong's felt like an easy drive plus it takes you to the freeway if you drive all the way down. If you are adventurous you can even walk to Diamond Head to take the trail!Bottom Line- If you are looking for a good priced hotel that is central to Waikiki yet you feel like your still on a relaxing vacation. this is the place for you! Should definitely keep this high on the list of considerations. oh and free fast WIFI!I can go on and on about this place but I'll leave that to the next patron!Aloha!","San Francisco, California","ray j</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",13,5.0

Is it a wow factor hotel ? Well depends on the room you select, and based on the ocean facing upper level room we booked , there was lots of WOW factor.Rated around 4 star, Park Shore is well located opposite the beach, yes ocean front location. Quieter end of the beach front near the zoo, but close enough to the action if you don't mind 15 minutes walking to reach Waikiki's central hub.Our double room was clean, in good repair and large enough to have space for the normal dance of 2 people with suitcases etc . So, there is also an ABC store adjacent, also a Starbucks if you like their style of coffee and ditect access to Lulu's bar bistro. Enough choice to keep you interested andMany more food choices within a comfortable distance.If you would like an Aussie connection, try Tucker and Bevvy next door, providing fresh and thoughtful food that is a welcome non-fried food option that is owned and managed by a friendly Aussie.Give this hotel serious consideration and book directly as this allows options to discuss room choices and preferences that online providers do not offer nor guarantee.

Upon check in, we were advised we had been upgraded. The room we had booked was an oceanfront, which we did have (and it was amazing) however the upgraded room also had a view of diamond head. the room itself isn't huge, however it was more than satisfactory for the 5 nights we stayed there with 2 big suitcases and 1 small case. The bed (king size) was comfortable. The shower pressure was fine, bathroom bench was huge with lots of space however the bathroom wasn't modern. The pillows were hard however we called reception and requested other pillows, which were a little softer. Nice big pillows. The hotel had an expedia travel desk downstairs in the reception, which we booked 3 trips through. Malia on the desk was really helpful and friendly, however one gentleman we struck wasn't so much. I had emailed Park Shore twice in the month or 2 leading up to our stay, to ask if they had a hairdryer on site, as I couldn't see anywhere on the website that said they did. I never received responses from them.. I ended up having to ask on a forum on trip advisor, and previous guests advised me of the answer. I thought it was pretty slack of Park Shore not to respond to two emails. In saying this, the staff at check in and check out were helpful and very friendly, as were the porters and the cleaner was also lovely. Pool at hotel is nice, has a view over the beach.

I would rather pay a bit of premium with big hotel chains like SPG and Marriott because you get better facilities and service from well-trained staff. I found this hotel online (booking.com and hotels.com) but made direct reservations in the hotel website although the price is $10 higher as reviewers commented you get a better chance of upgrade if you check-in directly with the hotel. The only reason I chose this hotel is because of its location (closer to quieter beach and the diamond head) and they claim that rooms are newly renovated. I first booked a one night stay and booked two rooms (one for me and another one for my friend who is a resident of Hawaii and I'm visiting in Honolulu prior to flying to Maui). When I checked in, the guy at the check-in counter Erick was not very friendly and accommodating (which is so unexpected in Hawaii). I asked if the rooms could be right next to each other and he said the other room is at a different price point. Fair enough since I booked that in the hotel website which offers additional discount for Hawaii resident (since my. Friend is a resident of Hawaii); hence, it's at a different price point than the room I booked (an ocean view room).Anyway, they put as close enough on the same floor (18th) so that was fine. We went up to our rooms as soon as we're checked in and none of the keys worked for BOTH rooms. We tried a few times and they did not work. So, here I am very tired from flying from NY and I had to go back down and ask of another set of keys. I went back up and the room keys still did not work for BOTH rooms. I was so tired (and my friend has two little kids) so I decided to just call the front desk on my cellphone because they have no hotel phones on the floor. They said they will send someone up but it took so long that we tried and tried the keys until the door for both rooms finally opened. When I went back down to ask why the room keys were not functioning properly, apparently the batteries of the door locks need replacement. If these staff people were trained properly, they should have already told us that as soon as we were given the keys so I did not have to waste my time going back and forth from the 18th floor.On the facilities, while it is considered newly renovated, it seems not so newly renovated. The bathroom had rust on the drain and the carpet already looks not so clean. I got an amazing view on the ocean view room and that was the only thing I was happy about. The hotel lobby and floors have no air conditioning so it was really hot and I was sweating and feeling disgusting by the time I checked into my room. I have not read this point in prior reviews so would have been helpful to know that this hotel property is using fresh air than air conditioning. Therefore, it is a consideration during really hot weather, which was the case (89 deg) when I checked in. The pool is so basic and nothing attractive about it except the view of the ocean. Useful if you're tired of salt water from the beach.Upon checking out, since my flight is at 5pm, I asked if I can keep one of the rooms for a late check out so me and my friend's kids can still enjoy the beach or swimming pool at the hotel and have a place to shower before I need to leave for the airport. Since I paid for two rooms, I thought they will be courteous enough to let me keep one of the rooms (even the cheaper room). The woman at the front desk (Leny) said late check out to 3pm costs $30. I agreed to it because I needed the room to shower. I have never been charged for late check out at SPG or Marriott hotels!I was already disappointed with this hotel but I know after a few days in Maui, I will be back in this hotel with a friend. Since it's already too late to cancel and find another hotel within my friend's price range, I did not switch to a different hotel but would have liked to. So, today I checked into this hotel again after 3 nights at the Sheraton Maui, which was a fantastic hotel! My friend and I was on an early flight (7:30am) from Maui to Oahu so I know it would be impossible to check in early but I was hoping especially since I got injured in Maui. We arrived at the hotel at 9:30 am and Leny (Uggh..) was at the check in counter. I was trying to be nice so nice and friendly even though I already had a not so nice experience with her before. I asked for an upgrade and she said with a smile that there's no Ocean view rooms as they are fully booked tomorrow (which is a Saturday). She gave me a partial ocean view on the 6th floor. I asked for a higher floor because I read from reviews that it's very noisy up to 7th floor because of delivery trucks and street noise but she said, again with a smile, that there are no other partial ocean view rooms. I asked if I can check in already and they said the room is not yet available as the customer has not checked out and may not be available until after 12 noon as that is their check out time. Meanwhile, I checked their website if I booked today and check in today and check out on Sunday and booked 3 rooms, there would have been 2 rooms with double beds (one standard and partial ocean view) and 3 rooms with Ocean view. So, I'm extremely tired, injured (with an obvious bandage on my right ankle), limping and disappointed so I gave up on asking for anything because I'm not getting anywhere. I left and had breakfast with my friend. We came back at around 11:30 am and the room was still not available according to Leny. I wanted to go to Safeway to buy some groceries and Leny said it's only 15 minutes walk or take a bus at Marriott which is 2 minutes away on foot. She already saw me injured and limping so I just asked for a cab. Thank God I did not listen to her because it was actually a 10 minute cab ride. I came back from Safeway at around 1 pm hoping the room is finally available but she said the customer just checked out. I said ""I thought your check out time is 12 noon?"" So she changed her story to the housekeeper is still cleaning the room. I sat down at the lobby feeling pissed and a couple walks in to check in. I then overheard Erick say to the couple ""today is a good day because your room is ready, two double beds as you've requested"" and he offered the warm towels to freshen up. I was fuming deep inside because I wanted a room with two double beds and I checked in with him before after a long flight and he has not offered warm towel to me and I checked in today early with Leny and she's not offered me a warm towel either. So, as soon as the couple left, I went up to Erick and Leny and asked them why the couple got checked in really fast while I'm waiting since 9:30am and why I have not been offered warm towel when I checked. I said do I have to be a certain nationality or ethnicity to get a decent service? And all Erick could muster was the couple was is a standard room and if I wanted some fresh towels. He obviously did not get my point and this boils to untrained staff or not conscientious, which is a stark contrast I got from Sheraton. Their price difference is not extremely more than Park Shore but the level of service is definitely different. I think I would stick to my SPG hotels since I do get the service that I pay for. On a separate note, while I was waiting in the lobby, a woman slipped because there was water on the floor and there was no sign. She was very upset because she hurt her knee. They gave her ice and made her file a written complaint. I heard her asking for some sort of compensation. I would do the same if that happened to me. Again, my point on the service level at this hotel. I'm going to be here for the next two days but I'm done being nice since I don't get anywhere being nice to these people. The only saving grace of this hotel is the amazing view if you get an ocean view room.","New York City, New York","Liz1023</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",12,2.0

It's not lavish, but the price is reasonable and the location is ideal, right on the ocean and right at the end of the developed beach opposite the also scenic Honolulu Zoo, which I like very much. The rooms are fine even if in the interest of keeping costs down you choose one without an ocean view. Buying breakfast or takeaway lunch is a snap. There is a Starbucks and a great sandwich place right off the hotel lobby. The Starbucks opens very early in the morning when as I luckily discovered, not being a morning person, there is a lot of activity in the area with early risers up for jogging or surfing or some other appropriate challenge for that time of day. If you want a sitdown breakfast go to Lulu's off the second floor of the hotel, but Lulu's is kind of expensive so we did not do this often.

This place is right across the street for Waikiki beach, and was able to give me a good price. I will break down the review on a few key points.1: Staff- The staff at the desk and valet were very friendly and professional. They would take the time to great me, and ask about my day in a way that felt much more friendly than professional. Three people that stood out as a highlight were Dylan , Violet and Averi. On top of being friendly all three of them were always willing to take the time for a brief chat, or recommending some great local places to eat or visit. 2: Location- Like I said earlier it is right off the beach, and by the Honolulu Zoo. All kinds of shopping and restaurants are with in walking distance as well as public transportation. This is a great bonus because the traffic here is horrible.3: Room- The room I had was nothing special. It was comfortable but could have fit in almost any decent hotel any where in the world. The biggest downfall was the poor wifi. They had an option to increase the speed, but to be honest it was very over priced. I do a lot of work on my computer, and a bad connection can make even the simplest task feel like a chore. Although there is a big part of me that is telling me ""why are you complaining about stuff that keeps you in your room when the beach is right across the road!??!""All in all I really enjoyed my time there. Like most places I have stayed the room will be removed from my mind before my flight takes off, but the impact the staff had on me will be remembered, and I will be coming back.","Honolulu, Hawaii","WTH-Man</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",2,4.0

This hotel was booked by our travel agent. Our vouchers clearly stated honeymoon couple. We were given no congratulations, no upgrade, no note....nothing! The hotel itself is average the rooms are very small! Literally a bed with a bathroom. Our shower curtain absolutely stank of musty, wet material. The most annoying part of our stay was the fact that we paid a $50 deposit on the room upon arrival, which is standard and we authorized. We hired a car and parked it overnight at our hotel for 1 night. We clearly told the valet it would be for 1night only. We were told we would be charged $25 to our room, which we accepted. 3 days later a little over $100 was taken off my credit card. When I questioned this with reception the lady at the front was rude and told me that it was because we parked our car. She answered a phone call mid conversation to ""assist another guest"" and spoke with them for 5 minutes before returning to me. Which I found extremely rude given I was mid way through trying to sort out my issue. The lady at the front desk admitted that the money should not have been taken off my credit card however was ""unable to release the hold until we checked out"". This was because it would take 7-10 days to return. She did offer to release the money as soon as we checked out but that was 3 days later and did not help us given that we had budgeted to use that money during our stay. So all in all the hotel held $150 of our money for the time stayed, $100 of which I did not authorize. I mentioned to reception I was concerned that the hotel had access to my credit card and were taking money whenever they felt like it and all she could offer was ""I'm sorry"" I was no reassured it would not happen again. I was genuinely concerned but could not do anything about it. Not acceptable in my eyes when my credit card security is at risk!!Definitely would not stay here again.

We also made good use of Tucker and Bevvy which is located within the Hotel and has a great supply of takeaway or dine in sandwiches, salads and juices. The hotel is a short walk to the main part of Waikiki so is accessible to shopping, restaurants and other attractions.

I'm sure there are fancier hotels in Waikiki and I wouldn't want to stay at the Park Shore without a room with a view, but our experience was great. There is a good organic food place off the lobby - Tucker & Bevvy - so you can have a very economical stay by eating their delicious breakfasts and take away salads. The hotel is located just across the road from the beach and they give you the use of hotel towels which is helpful. Others have complained about small rooms and this surprised us as our room was plenty big enough. Similarly, others have mentioned noise from a night club.

I wanted a hotel on the beach with a lanai with ocean views. The view from our room (1007) is spectacular stretching from Diamond Head to a great expanse of Waikiki Beach. As the hotel overlooks the zoo the view is uninterrupted and you are not overlooked in the 07 rooms by any other room. Complete privacy. The lanais fit 2 chairs and a side table easily and are very large for a lanai. I was worried about the size of the rooms given other comments but we have 2 double beds and there is plenty of space. The 07 rooms also have a second window which overlooks the ocean to watch the sun go down. Lu Lu's the bar downstairs was noisy at night but shutting the doors cut out most of the noise.

We found it quieter and less frenetic to be at very end of the Waikiki hotel strip, across the street from the zoo and a park, a walkable distance to Diamond Head. Nice that the beach area across the street from the hotel was sheltered by a breakwater. LuLu’s, the hotel’s second-floor open-air dining restaurant, seemed to have a varied and reasonable menu, and the sandwich shop adjoining the hotel entrance offered a quicker alternative. On Thursdays, for a more casual meal you might try the farmer’s market held in the courtyard of the Hyatt Regency up the strip. Overall we had a very pleasant experience at the Park Shore, and would not hesitate to recommend it. Though we lost a full day on Oahu thanks to United Airlines, the hotel understandingly modified our reservation from 3 nights to 2. We were still able to visit the Arizona and Missouri (with E Noa Tours – mahalo, Carlos!), and we did hike Diamond Head (took a cab to the entrance lot, but walked back to hotel), each of which should not be missed.",Illinois,"J K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Illinois</strong>",14,4.0

We arrived a few hours before the check-in time and I was nervous that we'd be sitting in the lobby for hours with our luggage. But we walked right up and they told us our room was ready. I was very pleased. Facing Diamond Head and the beach, the view was breath-taking. We looked right over the zoo and could actually see the flamingos around the lagoon and hear the monkeys(?). The room was not large but was exactly what I expected in a city where space is at a premium. It had everything we needed including a large lanai where we spent most of our time when in the room. The room and, more importantly, the bathroom felt clean and the bed was very comfortable. The only issue we had was on Monday night when the noise from Lulu’s club next door went into the wee hours in the morning. We like to sleep with fresh air but that night we had to shut the door and go with a/c. Even with the glass door shut, it was loud. Luckily it was only that 1 night. The other nights were perfectly peaceful.We rented a Volvo directly from the hotel for one day on a last minute decision. For a last minute car rental decision, the price was fair. They have only a few available so be sure to inquire as soon as you can. The car was really nice. Getting to and from the freeway from the hotel was also extremely convenient. On parking, there’s metered parking on Kalakaua Ave as you head to Diamond Head. After 6pm, parking is free until sometime in the morning. It might be tough finding a spot during the day but if you wanted to park your car overnight, there were plenty of people leaving as it got later in the afternoon. We parked for a few hours about a 5 minute walk from the hotel and from our room, we could see the car. The bonus was we found a meter that still had time left in it and didn’t have to pay! It might be worth checking out the parking situation on that street.Overall, the location being across from the beach was such a plus! And the people working at the reception desk were very friendly. Although when I asked about the best way to get to the airport, the girl was strangely unhelpful. She just said the best way depends on the person and how long they want to take to get there. Uh…thanks, but I kinda figured that out myself. One tip: Right around the corner from the hotel, The Cookie Corner shares a space with Subway (between the Aston Waikiki hotel and the Starbucks). I would highly recommend the cookies. They were so delicious! We went there every day.

We did not eat in the restaurant because it was way too loud for us. We like to party as much as the next person, but when I eat dinner, I like to be able to talk with our friends without screaming. However, a younger crowd was having a great time. They were helpful storing our luggage until we left, although one of the people at the desk were a little surly, overall the staff was helpful.

New phone with radio. Beds are very comfy. Bathrooms are a little small. But huge rain shower shower head made it no big deal. From checkin to checkout the staff was top notch. Housekeeping did a nice job every day. The location is a 3 mile run to Diamondhead, which I did every morning. Very scenic. Rented a car, and they did not have the basic model available, so they gave me a Volvo convertible for the same price for a week! Lots of good food nearby, including Tommy's burgers, which is the bomb! Get the Garlic fries with your orders for sure. Wolfgang Puck Express is right there as well, and is delicious. And there was a Jamba Juice being built right there as well. Starbucks is right next door too. And you are just a very short walk to Dukes, and Rumfire, which are two of my favorite spots on the strip.

Furthermore, having let ourselves be talked into a round trip payment at a slight reduction, before even boarding the shuttle, we were dismayed that their credit card machine did not function and we had to use cash. This left no way to get out of the return trip. People walk in and out of the open and breezy lobby, tracking sand and water, and spilling their Starbucks or Tucker and Bevvy purchases on the carpets.

I had done a LOT of research on Waikiki hotels and my priority was finding a clean, well-run hotel with an ocean-view balcony at a decent price. Waikiki is not cheap, and ocean-front properties (and views) come with a premium. But I really wanted to have a balcony where I could chill in the afternoon and look out at the ocean. Park Shore offered this at a reasonable price. Best of all, they charge NO RESORT FEES and have FREE wi-fi. That's a big savings compared to a lot of the big chain hotels. It's not a luxury property -- most room access is from outdoor corridors, and there is no room service or plush robes. But that's not what I was looking for. After reading many reviews and seeing photos of the renovated rooms, I decided to book at the Park Shore Waikiki. While this hotel is at the end of the ""strip,"" it's plenty close to dining and shopping, and the beach walk is wonderful! I booked an oceanfront balcony -- my room was on the 12th floor and had an incredible view -- the ocean before me, and views of the Honolulu Zoo to my left. From the walkway outside my room, I could see Diamond head. My room/bathroom was clean and recently renovated. I was traveling alone, so I had plenty of room for storing my things. There was even a small refrigerator. I loved sitting on my balcony, and was often visited by some small birds -- I'd advise against leaving your balcony door open just in case one decides to fly inside. I liked having a Starbucks downstairs, and I enjoyed several meals (breakfast and dinner) at Lulu's on the second level. I loved the open-air environment, and the beach views were great. The food was tasty and very reasonably priced. There were also a couple of ABC convenience stores in/adjacent to the hotel. I had read quite a few reviews mentioning the presence of homeless people, and I spotted a few camping out across the street at the park, but they were no problem whatsoever. I did see law enforcement quite a few times cruising the area, and felt very safe, even traveling alone.I'd also read about traffic noise. It was there, for sure, since the hotel is just across the street from the beach. I'd hear a tour bus come by quite regularly with a recorded message. But I just tuned it out. It really didn't bother me or keep me awake at night. If noise is an issue, bring some ear plugs!I attended the manager's poolside reception on Wednesday and got to meet the manager and other staff. It was very informal and not a ""must,"" but something nice that they offer. I didn't actually swim in the pool but it was nice having it there. I think I might have used it if it was open at night.There is so much to see in Oahu! Pre-cruise, I did not rent a car. I booked several excursions that picked up near the hotel (Circle Island tour, Pearl Harbor tour, Sunrise Photography tour, and Germaine's Luau) and walked the rest of the time. So I didn't have to pay to rent or park a car.I hope to return to the Hawaiian islands some day and spend more time at some of my favorite spots. If I return to Oahu, I will book the Park Shore without a second thought, and strongly recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, modern property facing Waikiki Beach at a very reasonable price.","Orlando, Florida","CathyEM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orlando, Florida</strong>",4,5.0

Opposite the Zoo.It was very clean and efficient and this area is quieter than further south where there are more restaurants, night life and some red light happening. The hotel has no bars (private bar on the beach at the front) , no room service and the pool area is basic.We originally had a room facing the hotel next door, which had a tiny balcony (one small person ) and no real outlook. Got upgraded to a room on the side at the front which had a 2 person balcony and nice beach outlook. I imagine the views of beach and diamond head would be spectacular from the font and north rooms. Service was fine when you asked for something but not pro-active.

You literally walk across the street and are at the beach. The hotel provides you with beach towels which is a great service since once you are done for the day, you trade them in for clean ones. They also have beverages in the lobby; coffee & water in the morning and guava juice & ice water in the afternoon which is wonderful after coming back from enjoying a day at the beach. The staff was super-friendly & accommodating and you can plan & schedule tours with a representative from Expedia in the lobby. We had breakfast twice and coconut shrimp for lunch once at Lulu´s which is located on the second floor which was really good and we had dinner once at the Japanese restaurant located in the lobby & enjoyed some really good traditional Japanese cuisine. There is also a sandwich shop adjacent to the lobby of the hotel and a Starbucks a few feet away. The only reason why I gave the Park Shore 4 out of 5 stars is because of the layout of the room. I felt it was a little tight and there was no table to sit at to enjoy a snack, etc., and I would highly recommend they add a clothes line with a retractable cord in the showers to hang wet swimsuits, but for the price (we purchased a flight+hotel package) it was a great value and the location was perfect. The rooms were very clean and I was impressed at how clean the lobby and elevators were kept since the beach is right there and I would have thought there would be sand everywhere. I would definitely go back to and highly recommend the Park Shore Waikiki.","Guatemala City, Guatemala","Ginri</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guatemala City, Guatemala</strong>",45,4.0

We loved this hotel! We arrived early but were able to check in and were even upgraded to a Diamond Head Suite, which gave us a fantastic balcony view of both Diamond Head and the beach. This room had a living area with sofa and large flat screen TV, kitchenette area with small fridge, microwave, and sink. It appears that everything has been recently renovated. We spent many hours just sitting on the balcony and enjoying the sights. We could even see the flamingos floating on a pond in the zoo, and hear the monkeys and the elephants! One small negative of the Diamond Head suites is that they also overlook the large air conditioning units on the roof. This doesn't affect the view, but they are noisy. We ate breakfast one day at the restaurant, LuLus, with seats overlooking the beach. I really enjoyed the pineapple cream stuffed French toast with Macadamia nuts! We also frequented the Starbucks that was right next to the hotel, as well as the ABC store for quick souvenirs. The hotel had valet parking for our rental car, which cost $25 a day/plus tip.

The result of the location is that the feeling is more peaceful than the centre of the hotel strip, and there are uninterrupted views of Diamond Head as well as the beach. We stayed in the ""one bedroom ocean view suite"" which several staff told us was the best room in the hotel - it was certainly the most expensive, but still very competitively priced when compared with the more famous hotel options on Waikiki beach. The view is not 180 degrees, as it is blocked on one side by the other wing of the hotel - but it is still an absolutely stunning view and made us happy spending plenty of time in the room. The ""one bedroom Diamond Head Suite"" would also be a good choice - less ocean but a great view of Diamond Head. The suite has a properly separate living area - doors can be closed between bedroom and living area, meaning we could stay up after our three year old went to bed. You can sit on a comfortable couch and gaze at the sea. This is worth the cost for this room. The two generously sized lanais both have great views. The quality of the interior furnishings and fittings is very high - the room has been recently renovated and is maintained to a high standard and scrupulously clean. In terms of furnishings the only thing missing is for one of the lanais or the living area to have a table that one could sit upright and eat at, rather than eating our cereal on our laps!Despite being described online as an apartment with a kitchenette, this is a hotel suite not a condo. In particular, the kitchenette consists only of a microwave, toaster and smoothie maker - no real cooking facilities or equipment - which would not answer the description of a kitchenette in Australia. However, when we complained about this to the hotel staff and pointed out the online description, every possible step was taken to address the issue, including lending us the portable hotplates used to cook staff meals! Also, we were told the online description would be changed, and hence I have not let this point affect the high rating that this hotel otherwise deserves. The free wifi worked well, except for the fact that it was too slow for camera/ipad connectivity, and there was no way to fix this. The hotel staff were very helpful and followed up well on any issues. There is no room service but the kitchenette was sufficient to allow self catered breakfasts, and the (rather Aussie named) ""Tucker and Bevvy"" shop downstairs sells great quality, though not cheap, take away sandwiches, smoothies and snacks.The hotel pool is not fancy but was nevertheless a hit with our three year old and has a nice outlook over Waikiki. In general the hotel is of an older style, but well kept up and with rooms renovated, so that the general feeling is laid back and pleasant. The beach directly opposite the hotel is enclosed by a sea wall, making it good for toddlers but to have a real swim in the waves you need to walk back towards the centre of Waikiki, but this did not bother us as it's a very short distance and a pleasant walk. If you want to catch the ""pink line"" trolley to Ala Moana shopping centre, the length of the journey will be shorter if you take it from near the hotel rather than walking into the centre of Waikiki. The smell of cooking meat from the ventilation systems of nearby restaurants was an occasional annoyance, however it was something we noticed frequently elsewhere in Waikiki as well.","Melbourne, Australia","dpolites</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",30,5.0

Thus, at the Park Shore, we could easily access the strip, the beach, and yet in our room, felt pleasantly removed from the craziness just north of us. We just visited Hawa'ii again, this time for a cruise and didn't think twice about returning to the Park Shore to 'bookend' our trip!

We returned from our cruise early in the day long before the check in time, and they didn't hesitate to let us in early. Again, to another room with a stunning view!!

Our rooms weren't ready which I didn't expect since it was only 9am and check in time is usually after lunch. Being a family of 6 we had booked 2 rooms asking for inter-connecting only to find out they don't have internal connecting rooms except for the suites. Jarrah said to leave it with her. In the mean time we headed up to the hospitality room the hotel offers and got changed ready to head out for a swim. Once we go back downstairs Jarrah asks us if by opening a door on the verandah would this be suitable for us, we were more than happy with this solution. To our surprise the rooms were ready for then and there. She also asked if we would like to have a look to make sure it was 100% ok for us. Once we got to the rooms they were fantastic. Were they the biggest rooms I've ever stayed in?? No, but they were very clean and offered us everything we needed and in one of the rooms my 4 children 16,14,10 & 6 yrs, the older 2 being teenage girls, had more than enough room for the 4 of them. Although only being on level 4 the view was amazing and we were nice and close to the pool as well. I would recommend this hotel to any of my friends to stay in and was worth every penny being across the road from the beach. The beach across the road is a fantastic beach for anyone with little children or have no need for some waves. We did tend to head a little further back down into Waikiki to swim due to having renting a surfboard from the lobby for a week. We also rented a car through the hotel. I did ask someone who was working the night shift about car hire and she said they didn't hire out cars. I was pretty sure I had read something about that on tripadvisor so the next morning when we saw Jarrah we asked her. 2 days later we were driving out in our 7 seater Volvo for the day. Any questions from then on, like what was the best way for us to get to diamond head, were to stop on our travels around the island we just waited until we saw Jarrah at the reception. This hotel being up the other end is a little further up then I would like if I went back to Waikiki but it was worth the extra block or 2 of walking to get out of the heart of Waikiki to get away from the craziness of Waikiki and and the high end shops. It had more of the feel that Hawaii had years ago before it got more about highend shopping centre's. Yes there are a lot of homeless people out the front but they are everywhere in Waikiki.

The room was on the smaller side, but not horribly so, and the views more than made up the for the size. The only problem was that on Monday nights, Lulu's (on the second floor) has ""service industry night"", and essentially turns into a club. If you plan on getting a full night's sleep, and don't have a white noise machine or app, good luck! We were on the 7th floor, and could hear the music clearly in our room with the sliding glass door closed. Fortunately, we sleep to white noise, so we were able to drown it out.Another slight issue is that the A/C only works when the sliding glass door is shut completely. Sounds like it's not that big of a deal, but the A/C would decide that the door was apparently not shut enough, and turn off fairly often. Apparently, being shut and locked isn't always enough.Also, there's no parking at the building. They charge $25 per day for valet service, which when added to the constant tipping if you're driving around alot, can add up quickly!The front desk was very accommodating and allowed us to leave our luggage there on the last day, as our flight wasn't until that night and we didn't want to lug everything around all day.

This hotel sits on a corner lot, and has some amazing advantages none of the ""Big Name"" hotels have. This is NOT a Hilton or a Trump or any of the ""Best Known Names"" hotel, but for us it was so much better... it was absolutely fantastic. Quiet, clean and comfortable, with out-of-this-world views...Our room was an ""07"" room which means the number ends in ""07"" and as such is a corner room with one view looking right down and across the street at the beach, and the other across the street to the Zoo, which is more like a lush park, and in the distance an amazing view of Diamond Head, especially at sunrise.The lady I talked to at the desk (her name was ""Kiblai"" ), late one night, when asking about the hotel and eventually making our reservation was so very helpful and patient and attentive, I would give her a 99 out of 10, ( yes, 99 out of 10, not 100) as she certainly was beyond professional, and personable, and If I were a hotel manager I would try to scoop her away in a heartbeat. She sealed the deal with us. Her personality and helpfulness and complete attention to detail was exactly what we were looking for.. call it hand holding if you like, but for us, we were exceptionally pleased. All the staff from the concierge to the cleaning staff, were very friendly and the room was always spotless. The restaurant attached was great and you can read my review about that too. If you are a Starbuck kind, there is one on the ground floor of the hotel along with two ABC stores for just about any need whatsoever. Breakfast/lunch place also on ground floor serves up the best in healthy food, and absolutely delicious ""built before your eyes"" sandwiches and platters to die for. Two minutes walk to the scooter rental place, and trolly pick up is one block away. Bus stop is right across the street.Lots and lots of very close nearby places to spend some time and of course, Waikiki Beach is directly across the street. Aquarium is maybe 5 or 6 minutes easy walk down the road.Sunrises and sunsets to die for, and probably the only hotel that has rooms that don't look out onto another hotel...go figure!Not saying it might be the best choice for you or your guests, but it certainly was exceptional for us.

My husband and I recently stayed there early may to celebrate our 5 year anniversary. I've stayed at 7 other hotels but I never got the ""Aloha"" feeling from them like I did here. Leny, Desiree, Violet and a few others were always helpful at the front desk. This hotel is smaller but had all the amenities you will need. Every staff member (maintenance crew, maids, valet, etc.) said hi to us with a smile. The rooms: We originally got the ocean front room (such a bargain for the incredible view). The room was on the small side but perfectly comfortable for the two of us. On the 2nd night, we had an issue with our room, the staff and manager on duty were quick to correct the issue and relocate us to a different room. We ended up getting the Jr. Suite that was almost double the size with an amazing view of the ocean and Diamond head. Definitely get a ocean view, ocean front or Jr. Suite rooms, totally worth the upgrade. Beds were comfy, plenty of space in the bathrooms.Perks: You can borrow chairs and towels from the front desk, so no need to bring, buy or rent any. They also offer a car rental service (all Volvos) for $63/day for sedan or $71/day SUV. If you keep the car for multiple days, you do not have to pay for parking ($25). We ended up getting a sedan for two days, it was a lot of fun to drive and pretty good on gas. Lulu's is a fun place to go and have drinks in the evening. There is a pool but we never used it, the beach was right across the street. Cons: You have to pay to print your boarding pass downstairs in the lobby, but it was only $1 so not a big deal. Other posters complained about the homeless people out front but that's a city issue that the hotel really has no control over. Other then that, I can't think of anything negative about our stay, that's why they get 5 stars!","San Diego, California","itaneasily</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",9,5.0

Its location at the East end of the Waikiki strip turned out to be very convenient to get away to other parts of Oahu like Diamond Head, Koko Crater, Hanauma Bay, Kane'ohe, etc. The Waikiki strip is a traffic nightmare at times, so if you plan to explore beyond Waikiki, this could be the perfect hotel for you. Even if you plan to spend your entire trip in Waikiki, its still a decent choice.Note: we were celebrating our 5th wedding anniversary and were given a ""free upgrade"" from a standard room to a partial ocean view (see photo).PROS- Steps away from Waikiki Beach (the ""slightly"" less busy end too!)- Convenient location to 'escape' Waikiki to other parts of the island- Wonderful ""picnic food"" shop (Tucker + Bevvy)- Bar & Grill is one of the most popular nightlife spots on the Waikiki strip- Surf School, ABC Store, Expedia expert, Starbucks all in lobby or adjacent- FREE WI-FI (a must for all hotels I stay at)CONS- Small room (not a huge deal as we didn't spend much time there)- Busy street corner, noisy on lanai or with door open- Pool faces same busy street corner - Wifi is a bit slow unless you pay for upgrade (its enough for email and browsing though, just don't try to download an iTunes movie in under 24 hours!)","Vancouver, Canada","T2984RXdavidr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",13,4.0

I was tasked with finding a hotel for myself and several friends - a scary proposition considering the expectations of a Hawaiian vacation. But the Park Shore met them all!I booked the Partial Ocean View room and got just that and more. I was in room 719 which is in the corner of the building facing the ocean. While my balcony looked directly at the balcony on the opposite side I still had a fantastic view of the ocean, pool and zoo. My friends were in 608 and they had a window (no balcony) that looked directly at the ocean and a balcony that looked directly at another building but when you sat on the balcony you could look between the buildings for a nice ocean view. I liked my room better!Lobby is bright and open. Rooms are modern, clean and spacious. My room was a bit smaller than some but it was a fair trade off for the view. All rooms come with a coffee maker and mini fridge. Perfect for those yummy finds at the Kings Village Farmers Market days. There's also a communal microwave on the third floor and complimentary coffee and infused water in the lobby. Speaking of lobby, the front desk people, Brian, Jessica, et al, were always helpful and friendly. They offered us the use of a hospitality room when we had to check out but still had time to hit the pool. Oh, the pool. Yes, small but we liked it that way. Calm, nice pool chairs and a great view of the beach. On Wednesday the Management had a ""get to know you"" party at 5:30pm at the pool. I didn't go but sat on my balcony watching it and it looked like fun!There are two ABC's, one on each side of the hotel, along with a Starbucks and a great little sandwich shop. Tiki's is just up the street. The food at Tiki's is a bit pedestrian for my taste but the views can't be beat. We ordered the edamame here and it came floating in butter and garlic. Super yummy but not your traditional healthy treat!The hotel is directly across the street from a beautiful stretch of Kuhio Beach. The hotel has a limited number of beach chairs and towels that you simply sign out for (complimentary) at the Bell Stand. I first went to the right side of the pier where the beach is protected by a rock wall. Schools of beautiful fish swim through here and it's the perfect place for children as there are no waves…just a beautiful sandy beach. A bit tame for my taste so I spent more time on the ""surf"" side of the pier.The Hans Hedemann Surf School is located in the lobby of the Park Shore and they have a stand on the beach where you can rent snorkels, boogie boards, etc. Take the surf lessons! We also booked a tour at the Expedia Desk to visit the USS Arizona and were not disappointed.Overall, I think the happy, friendly vibe, the location and the clean, updated rooms made this hotel more of an ""experience"" than just a stay.Things to do while at the Park Shore:* Walk up Kapahulu to the Corner Kitchen for some good grub and fantastic local music from 6:30pm - 8:30pm each night but Sunday.* Shop for a vintage Hawaiian shirt at Bailey's on Kapahulu (one block north of Corner Kitchen)* Eat malasadas at Leonard's Bakery. They come straight out of the kitchen, warm and ready to eat. Eat them immediately for a heavenly treat! (oh, come on, you're on vacation!)* Hike Diamond Head (a 3 mile walk from the hotel). Views are unbelievable. * Have an authentic plate lunch at Pioneer Saloon* Eat breakfast or dinner at Goofy's. Eggs Benedict with pulled Hawaiian pork was to die for.* Go to MarakameUdon for the best noodles EVER. You will have to wait in line, it goes fast and is worth the wait. Have the #5 and then have some of the tempura on the side. So delish!* Shop at 88 Tees for some of the funkiest, fun t-shirts ever. Plus just the store itself is worth the visit.

We also had a view of Diamond Head from the window, and it's a great view. It was handy to be so close to the beach, out the front of the hotel and cross the road at the lights and you're on the sand (well, on the footpath that leads onto the sand). Although the room wasn't huge, we had a bar fridge and a safe, which were two things lacking in many of the other rooms we stayed in over the course of our four week US vacation, so we were happy with that! The bed was large and comfortable and the rooms were well maintained and clean. The staff at the hotel were really helpful and friendly, anything we asked for was no problem. We hired a car from the hotel, which is a new service they have started and made it very convenient. We'd been advised by the shuttle driver that it was cheaper to get a car from the airport, but that would have meant a cab or shuttle ride back to the airport to collect it and then either a fee to drop it in town or another ride back after dropping it off. The price to hire a good quality car (they are all Volvos) direct from the hotel is reasonable ($63 for a sedan or SUV and $71 for a convertible) and you don't have to pay valet parking at the hotel if you use one of their cars. Make sure you check out the Japanese restaurant in the foyer of the hotel, as it was certainly not standard hotel fare. The food was fresh and delicious and the restaurant was full of Japanese people, which I always think is a good sign, and the prices were reasonable.","Leichhardt, Australia","JulieLee75</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leichhardt, Australia</strong>",252,4.0

This hotel EXCEEDED my expectations by a long shot. We used the ""Show Your Shaka"" for a 10% discount on the hotel room. The staff was extremely helpful the entire trip. We hiked Diamond Head one day - walked up there without renting a vehicle or getting a taxi - and when we got back they suggested we go to Koko Head one day of our trip. They gave us the bus route and times to get there. Koko Head was by far the best part of our trip and we wouldn't have even thought of going there without the suggestion. You are able to rent out beach towels - free of charge - and can return them after using. The pool area and vending room were always clean. The pool area overlooks the ocean and Lulu's. Our room was clean and had an updated bathroom. The cleaning woman, Juanita, was super nice and even if we had the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door, she would come back later on and ask us if we needed any clean towels or toiletries. The room also had a balcony that overlooked a part of the ocean - which was nice considering we didn't have an oceanfront room. The hotel is also attached to Lulu's, which was our favorite restaurant/bar and had acoustic music each night. The hotel is the end of the block for the hotels, so the views of Diamond Head are wonderful because there aren't any other buildings blocking it. Even when you go to get ice, you have a beautiful view of Diamond Head and the city. The only downside to being on the end is the homeless who lay out on the street at night. There aren't that many and they are harmless - they don't do anything to you. In that regards, my friend and I would walk to the beach area by the Royal Hawaiian (pink hotel), because it was more family oriented and we didn't feel bad leaving our backpacks by our towels. There was one homeless man who sold leis on the sidewalk. If you see him, you should buy one - he is a great guy.All in all, this hotel was fantastic and a great find. There is no doubt in my mind I would stay here again. Additionally, Eggs N' Things is worth the wait if there is a line, the crepes are amazing.","Eagan, Minnesota","katmars</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eagan, Minnesota</strong>",2,5.0

It has fabulous access to the H1 without going through the Waikiki traffic (King Street exit going to Hotel, straight up Kapahulu getting to H1). It is STEPS from the beach and this part of the beach is protected by a breakwater and is not as crowded as the beach center. Restaurants and shops are all within a 10 to 15 minute. I thought the valet parking would be a pain, but the valet attendants are friendly and quick. We never waited over 5 minutes for our car. The staff is friendly and extremely helpful, offering directions, printing boarding passes and ordering a last minute airport shuttle when flights were changed without any problems. When I made the reservation, I was fortunate and happened to get the manager who reserved an ocean front 1 bedroom suite (for my husband, son and I) which has a king bed in the bedroom and sofa sleeper in the living area with a kitchenette and a connecting double room for my mom. It worked perfectly. He even reduced our rate with a special came on line a few weeks later! The kitchenette has dishes and silverware allowing us to eat breakfast in the hotel although a Starbucks is conveniently located next door. The bath area was nice sized with plenty of towel racks. Also in our suite the bathroom sink was located outside the toilet/shower area which really helps with the morning routine. Our only minor complaint is that the pool closes at sunset and the evening is when we were looking for a relaxing swim. To be fair, it appears many hotel pools close early. Also my teenage son says the sofa bed is fairly comfortable but is close to needing to be replaced. While it costs more to be on the beach, in my opinion it is worth the extra cost at the Park Shore Waikiki.","Spokane Valley, Washington","Andrea B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spokane Valley, Washington</strong>",10,5.0

This was my first stay at the Park Shore and if I return to Hawaii again I would definitely stay here again. My room, 1720, was well away from any street noise ( heard two sirens during my week stay ) and came with views of both the ocean and the hinterland. It is obvious the rooms have been recently renovated as they are clean and fresh, with no signs of any wear and tear. The room had a comfortable king size bed, large television and refrigerator ( although I lost half a tub of ice cream to the freezer, which isn't ice cream friendly ). I've read several comments regarding the size of the rooms ( small ) however compared to a London hotel, they are ample. There was enough room opposite the bed, against the wall, for my suitcase which still allowed plenty of space to walk between bed and suitcase to the balcony. There are large drawers in the desk and a cupboard for hanging clothes near the bathroom. The vanity in the bathroom also had plenty of room for toiletries etc. The bedside tables were also a decent size and lighting was very good. In the foyer in the mornings there is complimentary coffee and during the day cold water and juice, a lovely bonus after a day out in the sunshine. I did not use the facilities however did read on the noticeboard in the elevators that there were microwaves and food/drink vending machines available on the third floor. I can recommend the pineapple smoothie from the café at the entrance to the hotel's foyer. The local paper is also provided each day, outside the elevators on each floor. There is a bus stop directly outside the entrance of the hotel, however, if heading towards the other end of Waikiki or Ala Moana the bus stop at the corner of Kuhio, one block over and a couple of blocks inland, is a better option. This hotel is directly opposite the beach, all you have to do is cross the road, and also faces the entrance to the Zoo. The Kahala Mall is also only a short bus ride away ( number 23 ), for Wholefoods, Longs Drugs and Macys.

They are a real eyesore and hopefully police will be more cognizant..although I have stayed at this end of Waikiki many times and this has been happening for at least 5 years.Housekeeping could speed it up a bit, especially when guests arrive at 12noon and reception does not make an attempt to get room available until right at 3pm. Knowing this is the actual stated check-in time, I suggest Management look into having them accommodate those people who have reservations as fast as possible...especially since I had to sit and wait for my room until 3pm...I am sure this a ploy because everyone who sat waiting for a room, even a couple who walked in off the street, were given their rooms within 1 hour of when I arrived. Since I use a walker, it wasn't possible for me to ""sit by the beach"" or take a walk......They were very uncaring at reception...and I assume housekeeping as well. FYI, worked in the airline industry 32 years, have taken more than 150 trips to Hawaii and have never been treated so rudely. And, I was NOT traveling on a discount. I am planning a trip in early April and doubt I will stay at Park Shore this time.",portland,"PLE4PVG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>portland</strong>",5,3.0

We sat on the lanai for hours just watching whales, people and cars. It was a little loud, but I assume the whole beach is when there are cars. We got to hear birds and monkeys from the zoo during the day as well.The staff was so polite and courteous! We never had any issues in this hotel. Don't be dissuaded when people say it's small; we were able to meander around our room perfectly fine with 2 suitcases full of clothes. We had a refrigerator and there is a communal microwave on the third floor. We got there early and left late so they held our luggage. The valet was $25 a day with in and out privileges, which we were happy with because it alleviated us from having to find parking all the time. Overall a great value, it's less busy on this side and there is a small sandwich store, Starbucks, and ABC store nearby. My advice though: skip the Starbucks and get Hawaiian coffee from the ABC store! Much better!We plan on coming back next year and are going to request the same room; it was breathtaking and I felt amazing watching the sunrise everyday over Diamond Head.","Ventura, California, United States","Kait09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ventura, California, United States</strong>",4,5.0

This hotel got really great reviews so we deceided to stay here. We stayed in room 1517 which at first seemed a little underwhelming when we first got in.

Liked having the free coffee, juice and water down in the lobby everyday.We used towels and beach chairs from hotel too.

There was also another large window facing the beach directly. The simple contemporary style was very attractive. The bed, ventilation, climate control and shower were all excellent. The only minor complaint was that there wasn't any place to put your stuff in the bathroom- another shelf would have been welcome. The location of the hotel was ideal for us- overlooking the beach and park, and out of the fray of the busier part of Waikiki.

If you decide to rent a car be warn the traffic in Honolulu is considered the second worst in the United States so plan around the rush hour traffic and enjoy the adventure it is definately the best way to see most of the island. Shop around for car rentals prices before getting to the island since you can usually get lower car rental rates from local tour operators.

There is a decent pool on the 3rd floor, also with ocean views, and a full restaurant on the 2nd floor. The beach across the street is nice and is kept clean. The hotel sits on the far end of the ""strip"" meaning it's not in the full hustle-bustle of tourist town. It's close to the zoo and the aquarium, both worth a visit if you're traveling with kids. Staff was okay, as were the beds (neither gets a great review though). The v-shape of the hotel means that most ocean front rooms will not have ""private"" lanais.

We got a decent discount on the room (the ""shaka"" deal) and liked the location near Diamond Head. We were very pleased with our stay! The room was a little ""plain"" looking, i.e., we certainly didn't end up with any of the promo rooms shown on the website, but we were on the 3rd floor overlooking the pool and facing the water. The room was comfortable and extremely clean; the housekeeping service, although often quite late in the day, was very satisfactory and they did a good job of keeping our room stocked and made up. The lobby area was pleasant and the desk staff was friendly and helpful. I loved the location - that end of the strip of hotels is much ""quieter"" and more relaxed, and I loved coming out of my room in the morning (our room opened to an outside balcony, as I think most if not all of the rooms do) to the sound of the siamangs in the Honolulu Zoo across the street! The pool area was nice and clean and seemed to have ample chairs and tables. A few ""not great"" things - the air conditioner was very loud, necessitating my wearing ear plugs at night (you couldn't turn it off at night because the room got stuffy). The ""business"" (i.e., computer) area was quite small, and I was a little put off that it would have cost me $$ to use the computers and $.70 per page to print our boarding passes, tourist directions, etc. Also, and I realize this isn't the hotel's fault, there are a LOT of apparently homeless people that hang out on the streets around the hotel. We arrived in Honolulu at 2:30 am and my daughter was hungry. The closest open restaurant was a McDonald's a few blocks away, and I was more than a little nervous walking by people sleeping on the sidewalk, sitting on the benches talking to themselves, etc. I think Honolulu needs to do a better job of caring for these people.

That makes their prices a little lower. You can still walk to most places you want to, it’s Hawaii, take your time and enjoy all the sights. The rooms were nice and comfortable. We walked out our room to the most beautiful view of Diamond Head every morning and sat on our lanai and looked at the ocean every evening, WONDERFUL!!! It has 2 ABC stores, a Starbucks and Lulu’s on the 2nd floor. They also keep a refreshing water pitcher and a punch pitcher in the lobby. Get you some of that punch and some island rum from the ABC store and make your own mai tais. YUMMY!!! They have a small refrigerator in each room and daily papers are available on every floor. They have a safe, hair dryer, free wi-fi in the rooms also. Our floor was on the 8th but they had 18 floors. Wish we had had a room on a higher floor to take advantage of the view even more. All the tour busses pick up right around the corner along with the Hilo Hattie trolley. The beach out front is protected by a beach wall but if you prefer the waves they are just a little further down. Yes, there was lots of homeless in this area, but I found this to be the case in most of Honolulu. They did not bother anyone or ask for anything and I never felt threatened. There may of seemed like more on this end because the middle of the strip is so crowded there is no place for them on the sidewalk. My husband came down sick and we needed a late checkout so he could rest till we had to leave the airport they arranged for this even though they had someone coming into our room that day and even waived the fee. I can’t thank them enough for this. I would recommend this place to anyone. With that being said I don’t recommend asking the concierge Averi anything. We asked her the best way to get to Chinatown and she was too busy visiting with the porters to answer other than get a bus or rent a car. I stopped on the afternoon we were to leave and asked how did I call for a porter to come get my luggage and she couldn’t tell me, really? There was a gentleman concierge and he was very helpful and nice the day my hubby came down sick and I wanted to go to the swap meet by myself. He arranged for me to catch a shuttle. If you do need information go over to the Expedia desk and talk to Stephanie Shirley. She will help you with anything, whether it is help figuring out what buses to take, arranging a tour, or helping you in any way. One time there was a couple from the hotel next door. They said their concierge was so rude at their hotel they just walked off from him and came over there.

Booked at the Park Shore Waikiki based on other great Trip Advisor reviews & good price compared to other top rated Waikiki hotels, and I was not disappointed.If you're looking for top-notch luxury and romance and/or five-star quality...this is not the place for you. I was looking for a reasonable price, good location, and a safe/decent place to call ""home"" for a few days knowing I'd be spending plenty of time at the beach and outside. This hotel delivered on all of those fronts, and on even more that I wasn't expecting.The good: -Service: Nick at the front desk and Mike in the lobby were the first two staff members I encountered upon arrival, and both were very friendly and helpful. I arrived on a late flight, and they got me checked in quickly, explained all of the amenities I might need (pool, dining, wifi, etc.). Them along with a few other staff members I dealt with during my time there were all great...very friendly, nice, etc. They all went above and beyond and it was noticeable. -Unexpected amenities: beach towels...you can just check them out and return them at the front desk which means 1) you don't have to pack your own and 2) you don't have to buy any while there. I literally used them every day and loved this service. Hospitality room: I deliberately booked a late flight out on my last day so that I could have the last day to spend at the beach, etc. What I didn't think so much about was how I was going to get cleaned up after that (since I'd have checked out by then). The answer came from Nick at the front desk (again) as I was checking out: ""did anyone tell you about our hospitality room."" I responded with: ""hospitality room??"" It's basically a room there at the hotel that guests can use to shower, get cleaned up, change, etc. even after you've checked out. Aka...awesome! So, I was able to spend pretty much my whole last day at the beach & swimming in the ocean, and then was able to come back, shower, change clothes, and freshen up before going to dinner, or waiting for my shuttle to the airport, etc. I would already have stayed at this property again, but that one amenity was a game-changer...it allowed me to have an awesome and comfortable last day on the island, which was the perfect end to an already great stay.-Location: perfect. Literally across the street from Waikiki beach. The property is on the Diamond Head end of Waikiki right across from the Honolulu Zoo. Easy to walk to most everywhere - took abut 10-15 minutes to get from the hotel to the Royal Hawaiian shopping area, etc. Lot of other places were an even shorter walk. I only rented a car one day to be able to drive around the island and up to the North Shore...you don't need one at all if you're planning on staying right there in Waikiki area. There's a 24 Hour Fitness center less than 5 minutes away on foot. I even walked to the Diamond Head Trail from the hotel...though, I will warn you that was a very lengthy walk and not at all hard, but something to plan for. It was about 2 miles to the trail itself, and the trail is a moderately strenuous mile...so, about 6 miles total round trip. Good workout, though!The Average:-Room: was nothing amazing, but it was comfortable and worked for my purposes while visiting. Small, but functional with a small lanai, mini fridge (a major plus), comfortable bed, 42"" flat screen tv, etc. Free wifi that worked really well, good air conditioning, etc. Overall, decent room at a great price. Only thing I would change is I booked a room with a city/partial Diamond Head view. Would have been worth the $20 or so per night to upgrade to a partial ocean view room and I would do so next time. Not the end of the world, though. -Pool: was pretty small and nothing to write home about...I personally never used it. That said, though, the beach is literally 100 yards from the lobby and the walled area (makes for very easy swimming/wading, etc.) is right there...so really convenient. The Bad:-That I only had 5 nights here! I could easily have stayed another week and been happy :) Overall, great experience at the Park Shore Waikiki (even better than I'd expected), and I will definitely return when I make it back to Honolulu next time.","Los Angeles, California","Brklynz20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",48,5.0

The great things about this hotel are: 1) The views from the rooms. We had a partial ocean view the first night then an oceanfront room the remaining four nights. If you can spring for an oceanfront room, do. Though the views from each room were beautiful (of both Diamond Head and the beach), the oceanfront room's view was exceptional AND the room was considerably bigger. The first room we stayed in was small enough for me to feel a little claustrophobic, though we didn't spend much time there. 2) The staff was amazing. A special thank you to Jara and Honore for helping us so much with getting a great room and for being so polite, personable and fun. Also, one of the managers (I think), David, was awesome, too. 3) Park Shore is definitely an excellent value. Way less money than other hotels on the strip. The not so good things: 1) The hotel is decidedly not a luxury hotel (though it does not claim to be). I like a little pampering on a vacation and my boyfriend's only requirement is a room with a roof. Park Shore was a good compromise for the both of us. Just little things here and there were kind-of bummers, like the fact that I had to travel down three floors to get ice, etc. Overall, I would stay at this hotel again and I would book an oceanfront room on a high floor.","Santa Barbara, California","22Nicole</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Barbara, California</strong>",4,4.0

Just a few steps, literally, from Waikiki Beach and the Pacific Ocean.Pool is on the 3rd floor, can get a little bit noisy from the traffic nearby, but didn't bother me too much.The rooms are newly renovated and where very clean. No complaints there. The only thing is that I felt the room was a little small, with limited space to put bags and suitcases. There are no chairs in the room, you have to sit on the bed to watch TV. But hey, you don't spend too much time in the room while on vacation in Hawaii?!?? ;)Tip: Wednesdays they have Managers reception, with drinks and snacks in the pool area.

The night table lights were seriously over-bright so I couldn't read because it disturbed my husband. I thought the room size itself was good but my husband felt claustrophobic. He is disabled and rented a scooter while we were there. He was going to use the valet storage downstairs but the only way to recharge the battery was to leave it out in the lobby. My husband didn't want the staff to be responsible for watching it while it charged and chose instead to take the scooter up to our room. So it made the room feel very crowded for him. There was one night where the odor of Lulu's grill became overwhelming and when I thought I might call and ask about it the smell subsided.

We ate here twice on our trip and it was incredible.The biggest drawbacks (and the reason the hotel is not getting a 5 star rating) are the size and comfort of the rooms and the quality of the amenities. The bed was extremely hard and super uncomfortable for me, though my husband quite enjoyed the firmness of the bed. Also, the pillows were uncomfortable and the sheets were thin and lower quality. The bathroom amenities were on the cheap side and the hotel is definitely no frills - no jacuzzi, no gym, no room service...just a pool and a vending machine area with a microwave.Despite the drawbacks, I would still recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Waikiki who wants a compromise between a good value and a great location.

Suggest Wolfgang Puck Express next door at Aston where you can sit outside. Makes for a more peaceful morning.On positives,: Our group had a diamond head suite and a one-bedroom suite. These were great rooms.Also dinner at Japanese restaurant was great.","Hong Kong, China","b0bbyhk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",5,3.0

From the time we checked in to the time we got on the shuttle to the airport, we were treated well by the friendly and helpful staff. We would definitely stay here again.The location was fabulous. Right across from the beach and the park with the zoo. Great views of the water, the city and Diamond Head. We were there days before Christmas and Waikiki was overrun with people but I do think that the hotel is on the quieter end of the famous beach. The hotel lobby is big and airy and there is a little area they’ve designated as the business center with a couple of computers but there is also free wifi throughout. The nice thing about the business center, though, was there was always ice water with citrus and juice available and there was coffee in the mornings. The pool is open during daylight hours only and has a great view of the beach and Diamond Head. In a room just off the pool, there’s a couple of vending machines and a microwave guests can use. The pool is small but refreshing if you don’t want to be on the beach but you still want to enjoy the sun and some water. The hotel is well maintained, I know it was just renovated but still, and staff seems to take pride in it. We were on an elevator with one of the maintenance guys and he asked how our stay was and seemed genuinely proud when we told him we were enjoying it. He thanked us and said they all work hard to make the place as comfortable as possible.As has already been mentioned in other reviews, there are two restaurants (we did take-out from Lulu’s one night and ate in our room. It was very good food), two ABC Stores and a Starbucks more or less attached to the hotel. There is also a store with sandwiches, smoothies and other “picnic” type things called Tucker and Bevvy and a great hamburger place called Teddy’s Bigger Burgers (one building over, next to the second ABC Stores). If you’re new to Hawaii and you don’t know about ABC Stores, they’re ubiquitous in Waikiki! Really! More so than Starbucks on the mainland. Basically they’re a convenience store that sells snacks, drinks, sweets and a few drugstore items like band-aids and sunscreen but also has clothing and beach stuff like mats and floating devices. The prices are quite reasonable as well. Oh and did I mention... they are EVERYWHERE. We checked in quite early because we were just off a cruise so our room wasn’t ready. Annie was checking us in and was very helpful. She saw to it that our luggage was safely stored and asked if we’d like to use the hospitality suite while we waited. We decided to look around Waikiki for a little bit so we declined. A little later we came back to see if our room was ready and when it wasn’t Crystal, who was at the front desk, offered the Hospitality suite again. She saw that we were wilting under the hot Waikiki sun and as she sent us up to the room, she also gave us some cold, jasmine-scented face clothes to cool us off. Crystal was around the other days we stayed at the hotel and was always cheerful and very helpful. She and Annie really helped set the tone for our stay. Our room was ready a little early and we were able to get into it around 2:30 or 3pm. The room is not big but it was perfectly adequate for the two of us. The bathroom was a good size and the shower had very good water pressure. The balcony was very small but it had a nice view of the water to one side and the hotel next door and the city on the other side. There was a very good sized safe in the room that easily fit my Macbook and cameras and other valuables. There was also a mini fridge to keep cold drinks and snacks. The bed was very comfortable and the large flat-screen tv was on a wall mount to allow for a little more space in the room. We were on the 16th floor and we didn’t find it particularly noisy but I can imagine it might be on lower floors. We have only two complaints about the Park Shore and they have to do with the room. They are minor but annoying nonetheless. First issue; there isn’t much place to hang things. Once you have a couple of towels, you’re hard pressed to find a place to hang your wet bathing suits and anything else. The second issue was a little more annoying and that is the room key cards don’t work very well. I know this is a wide spread issue, others have mentioned it here and we heard other guests complaining in the hotel as well. It took us four or five tries sometimes to get into our room. It didn’t detract from our stay but it might be something management should look into.Just a few final thoughts… you can sign out beach towels from the front desk and return them by 8pm. We usually signed out a couple of towels in the morning and then swapped them out for fresh ones in the afternoon. The hospitality suite is fantastic, especially when you have a late night flight and nowhere else to go for several hours. Probably shouldn’t say this since there’s only one room and I wouldn’t want to have to share it the next time we go back. There’s a shower and tv and it opens on to the pool and you can get a towel if you want to go to the beach.Thank you very much, Park Shore, for helping to make our first stay in Waikiki so wonderful. We’ll be back.","Vancouver, Canada","JnTTravelots</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",36,5.0

We were very worried and nervous about the hotel as we found out that there was lots of building work going on! Luckily this didn't effect us! The work men were working from the 15th floor upwards so occasionally we saw one of them but nothing was effected! Thank goodness!!! :) .........we done so much on our trip we visited pearl harbour which was amazing we went to the wet and wild water park that was great it was very quiet as it was not in peak season so there was no queues! I expect in the summer it would get very busy! We also hired a car and drove up to the north shore which was absolutely incredible! Words cannot describe it! It was also so quiet we were sat on the beach with only about 3 other people around us and no one was in the distance! We ended driving around the whole island which was a great experience!!! .......shopping!! ....the shopping is amazing!!! Make sure you have lots of money with you! There are lots of shops along the strip but there is also a shopping mall near by it will be in leaflets but unfortunately I cannot remember the name of it sorry! ...but you can catch the bus there and back and it will drop you outside the hotel which is good! .....food......food is lovely as you know it's a lot of burgers, chips, ribs and greasy food! But I did have the occasionally salad at a restaurant called chillis! I also recommend the Outback Steakhouse (the best steak you will ever taste!!!) I regret not writing this review sooner as I cannot remember half of what I wanted to tell you all!! .....but on the whole our trip to Hawaii was out of this world and would defenetly recommend!!! The park shore was also brilliant and has now been fully refurbished and looks great I would love to return back as the hotel was located at the end of the strip so you are away from all the busyness ....amazing hotel and people and WILL return again one day!!! :)","Southampton, United Kingdom","Abi03</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southampton, United Kingdom</strong>",17,5.0

The hotel was recently renovated and it shows with a large almost open-air lobby that was attractive and welcoming; good size, clean rooms; and extras like free newspapers, coffee (in the room and in the lobby) and cold drinks. Better yet, it is a perfect location, being right across the street from Waikiki beach and around the corner from the main tourist street in Waikiki -- lots of shopping, souvenir stores, and, especially, restaurants. Maybe the best of all, though, were the staff, who genuinely appeared to enjoy their jobs and go out of their way to make guests feel welcome.Although we booked the least expensive room for the pre-cruise stay, we were upgraded to an Ocean View room. It was better than we expected given the hotel’s location and cost. Better yet was our post-cruise stay when we booked an Ocean Front (not just ocean view) room. As we said above, we were especially pleased with the staff at the hotel, and Crystal deserves an extra pat on the back, and not just for upgrading us to the Diamond Head Suite (although that would have been enough for us to rave about her). The suite was clean and spacious, with a balcony facing Diamond Head with no tall buildings between us and it, a couch and table, chairs, plenty of closet space, and a small kitchen with a microwave, refrigerator, sink, plates, utensils, and more.

The problem is there is no aloha or welcoming spirit from the staff here - from the front desk, to the valet, to the odd reservation practices. The most welcome we felt in our 3 night stay was when we were leaving and the valet bid us farewell. When we arrived, it was several minutes before the valet even acknowledged us even though there were no other cars in the drive and no one offered to help us with bags. The front desk clerk seemed annoyed to be there, and muttered commands at us as she checked us in. This involuntary service attitude was the vibe we got the entire stay from all of the staff - they must have an awful work culture at this place in paradise!Also, beware of some shady reservation practices if you book an oceanfront room - despite being able to book a new reservation for the same dates for this room type, upon checking in - you might get 'upgraded' to a jr suite that has a view of a wall or your neighbors' lanai which - if you then step out onto your lanai and look right you'll see the ocean. They claim this is an upgrade because the rooms are bigger - but come on, if you book an ocean front room, view must be important to you. This happened to us and another guest, with the excuse that the rooms were oversold (despite the fact that they're continuing to sell them) - so I'm guessing it's practice and a bad policy.If this happens to you or you book a jr suite, just ask for a room on the outer tip of the building - the three rooms farthest from the center have nice views from the lanai (park views from the room).

Beyond the awesome staff our room was well kept and as expected, the location of the pool on the third level, with views of both Diamond Head and the beach, was a great place to relax and enjoy the view and the location at the far eastern end of Waikiki is perfect! You're close to all the action on the water with the added benefit of less foot and vehicle traffic (within reason, this is a major city and a busy one at that).We will definitely have Park Shore high on our list for our next trip to Hawaii!","Andover, Minnesota","todds2912</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Andover, Minnesota</strong>",1,5.0

I like being very close to the beach. This hotel is on the Diamond Head end of the beach and right next to big Kapiolani Park. The park is a nice place to walk or run and attracts lots of locals. When I checked into the hotel, another couple was having a discussion about the size of a roach in their room. I found my room to be clean (no insects) and it was large. Towels were nice, bed sheets were just OK. It included a small fridge, small lanai which didn't have any chairs (too small) and looked right at other adjacent hotels. I think the room could have used a chair. The style of the hotel isn't hip like Hotel Renew, but it is adequate. Also, they didn't add on ""Resort Fees"" as does Renew. I was in the 16th floor and my room was reasonably quiet. Only noise was from outside, and this can be masked by using the A/C. There is a sushi bar in the hotel; it's good, but very overpriced. LuLu's is next door. It's ""open air"" on the second floor with a nice ocean view. Good for breakfast, but dinner wasn't that great. Oh, and if you tire if the food in Waikiki, walk up the street about 15 minutes (towards Honolulu) and eat with the locals (Uncle Bo's or a tiny take-away place with fantastic poke - Ono Seafood, among others).

Crystal always made a point of not just smiling at us but would also call out to us when we walked through the lobby as if we were friends.The pool was located on the third floor which made for wonderful views of the ocean and the park across the street.

So when we decided to return this November we were happy and excited to know that the Park Shore was still operating but at the same time we were a little apprehensive about what time had done to this hotel as well as to Waikiki. Of course, our beautiful memories of the past were definitely colored by the fact that we were a young couple in love and everything was wonderful in this paradise like setting, including the Park Shore at that time. We remembered that staff as being very friendly ..,but what about now?? Now, when personal concern and kindness in general appear to be diminishing in this world we live in.As soon as we arrived at the front entrance we were met by a happy and friendly young lady with a bright smile, named Desiree who sincerely welcomed us and then almost immediately Erik a gregarious, portly attendant arranged to care for our luggage. So far so good, but how would check in go with so many visitors at the busy desk? Would we just be another number? An exceptionally keen, considerate and alert Krystal quickly processed our information but also asked some tactful personal questions about us. When she learned how long it had been since we had last been here she immediately contacted the manager Scott Pauli. After a little discussion Scott proposed a beautiful upgrade for us to a one bedroom suite facing the ocean. Needless to say we were taken aback as we had not expected this and it was not something they needed to do. The room and view was fantastic! But this gesture did give us an idea of the spirit here. As far as the hotel was concerned, it has just recently been totally renovated so it feels fresh and clean . The location is still great next to the zoo and Diamond Head and a little quieter being just a little ways away from the noisy, bustling strip. However, on the negative side, the room doors are heavily weighted and slam shut with such a thunderous thud that can be heard almost throughout the building. Disturbing especially If you are light sleeper.The Guest Service is super! Annie and David were not only thoughtful but very kind. They went out of their way to ensure that we were well cared for. In fact, Annie even gave us her own personal boogie board to use at the beach.Not just that first day, but on each day of our stay all the staff that we had dealings with, including the housekeepers, willingly went out of their way to be helpful and shared many useful tips, including letting us know about cheap but good places to eat. It was indeed enjoyable to be a part of this familylike atmosphere. And it speaks volumes when many of the staff say they have never worked for a better or kinder manager than Scott Pauli. He indeed has a big heart.But one major negative change for us was to see the number of homeless (many drunk or drugged) sleeping and begging on the main street, some quite close to the hotel. Some are sleeping literally in the middle of the sidewalk and you need to make an effort not to stumble over them. This was disturbing and is a blight/shame on this beautiful part of the world. We were also sad to learn that the famous International Market will soon be torn down to be replaced by more high end shops.But aside from that and a few other (progressive?) changes, we were delighted to be back again and especially to enjoy the warm, friendly and genuinely considerate hospitality of the staff at the Park Shore. Though this review may sound subjective, we did observe the same friendly helpful service shown toward the other guests as well. We are glad we chose to stay here again (brought back some warm memories of 1969) and would heartily recommend the Park Shore to anyone who wants to stay at a clean, friendly hotel that won't break your budget.We would certainly come back here again but definitely before another 44 yrs goes by!MahaloReino",Hong Kong,"Reino K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",1,5.0

Chose this hotel for the large pool deck and good size pool and beach right across road.Had any ocean view room on 18th floor.This hotel has major issues with Homeless and Vagrants which no one seems to be worried about. They (up to 20) camped 24/7 on side walk outside of hotel and at times you have to step over them as they lay across side walk. One night at 830pm there was a violent verbal confrontation btw them and it was disturbing with profanities flying around whilst families walked past. I felt unsafe. I reported this to hotel front desk next day. They said I should have done it immediately and that they normally dont have issues. Isnt this loitering isnt this illegal why does the hotel and city allow it!! It's embarrassing and unacceptable !! I have never seen this anywhere in the world so close to a hotel entrance and certainly not in any other hotel in Hawaii.The hotel is very lax with security as opposed to other hotels. Any person off the street can gain access to any floor it is very very open. The hotel needs card key entry to hotel floors simple as that to protect guests.The biggest gripe I had was the heavy slamming of hotel room doors all day and night. They are massively weighted and fling shut behind you so fast before you can control them. The noise was intolerable at times, all night with the constant banging and I am talking LOUD !! Noise from the corridors filter into the room like going through tissue paper very badly sound proofed but btw rooms was totally fine.Wasps !! If you go to the pool deck be aware of Wasps. I had 4 to 5 land on me they are massive and they stick to you like glue. One stung me on the hand my first sting ever in my life. My hand swelled up and the pain was intense. I stuck my hand in the pool and then iced it. It was fine but itched for 5 days. Take repellent.This hotel is the far far away from Ala Moana s/c which is the 3rd largest in America. Allow around 45min each way with the bus as the traffic can be a nightmare. I knew this going in and did not bother me at all. Just a tip really. PRO'S-Hotel staff a lovely super friendly and helpful-Was given my room immediately upon check in (730am) wonderful service !!!-One of the best pool and sundecks in terms of space and no casting of shadows-Pool seemed almost new the finish on it and very clean with complimentary pool lounges.-Huge size tv and balcony-Newish room very nice finish and furniture-Great shower albeit very very tiny the bathroom, the shower was great.-Tonnes of natural light all day flooding room and tonnes of lamps at night, the most light I have ever seen in a hotel room at night awesome job !!-Tonnes of power outlets I counted around 12 !!-Great a/c !!-Very firm and comfy beds and nice pillows.-Ice machine right near the pool was great to top up your drinks and keep cold.-10% off macey's shopping on back of your room key. Clever initiative.-We had a black out one night/morning with no water in hotel or the whole block due to massive storm. Hotel had generators for lighting and the water came back on in 1 hour so great job.-Bus no 8 from Ala moana shopping centre drops you off directly in front of hotel entrance, the last stop so that was very very convenient.-When I got to my room I noticed ceiling panel were lose and rattling. I told the front desk, Nick and it was fixed immediately and they checked the next day to see if I was happy. Super service.CON'S-All the major points listed above. Plus-Pool is on the 3rd floor and I noticed a lot of road street noise pervading the area but after a couple of days you got used to it when weighing it up with the great pool, its not a deal breaker.-Rooms are teeny weeny, I was shocked how small they were. For one person worked out okay just. But I felt claustrophobic at times. The bathroom is tiny too but adequate.-This is very minor but you had to return the pool towels to the front desk every day but why not have a dump bin on pool level like every other hotel ?? It was just unnecessary pain in butt.-No security latch on the room doors, the ones with the lever you can open ajar.-Closet was so tiny it was a joke enough for one person and that is it.-Saturday is bin day and after they empty dumpsters in the street the smell of garbage wafts up to the pool deck for hours very pleasant.-No cordless phone or second phone on desk would be handy was hard lying on bed and conversing for long periods. -No laundry facilities in the hotel which is utterly ridiculous that they dont have a communal laundry room like every other hotel I have stayed in. You have to walk 4 blocks to a laundromat. I used the sink and made a clothes line on the balcony which was fine for me.-No fitness centre. I knew this but something they can work on I think.CONCLUSIONI call a spade a spade. May be I have very high expectations but for $250 per night I expected a little more. The hotel overall is very good but could be great with some improvements. My experiences may not be those of others. I would give it a couple of years before I stayed here again I think.","Melbourne, Australia","ozdesign</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",24,3.0

The beaches at this end are less crowded and you are right across the street from the lagoon and the pier, and have great access to Kapiolani Park.The rooms are quiet with the balcony slider shut, we tried sleeping with the slider open once but utility trucks through the night and late night/early morning buses at the stop immediately outside the hotel made for an interrupted nights sleep. The bed was very comfortable. The air conditioner was a little noisy and intrusive which was more noticeable at night.Buses to Diamond Head could be caught right outside the hotel, and buses to Ala Moana were a few minutes walk away on Kuhio.An issue with housekeeping was more than satisfactorily resolved and management seem very approachable and keen to ensure you have a good stay.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Hekenga</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",6,5.0

We arrived late and I was disappointed at first because the rooms are so small and although remodeled, did not have the quality I would have liked. We stayed here 6 days and the place grew on me and I didn't mind the small rooms anymore because we were never in there except to sleep. Overall, I would stay here again because of the renovated room in this hotel class price range. If you want something fancier, you will have to pay more money per night at a higher class hotel. PROs: Right across the street is a beach with a sea wall which keeps large waves from coming up. Its perfect for families with small kids. If you want the waves, you can walk past the sea wall and you will be at regular beach. I loved that we were right on Waikiki strip so was able to walk to all the shops, most of which stayed open till 11pm. Room was renovated so newer bedding, flat screen TV, granite counter in bathroom, good water pressure in shower, housekeeping did a good job cleaning daily, Free Wi-Fi, LuLu's restaurant is on the 2nd floor for a great breakfast, Starbucks is on the first floor, ABC on the first floor and also outside the main doors. There is also an agent in the lobby who helped us book some activities. We were there during Aloha Festival 2013 and was able to watch the Floral parade right outside our hotel, fun to watch. Valet parking staff was fast and friendly. CONs: Parking with tax is about $23 per day; Valet parking only but is included with the daily parking price; no breakfast included, Small rooms; ice machines only on 3rd,7th,10th, 14th, and 18th floors. We were on the top floor (18th) so liked that we were close to the ice machine; no microwave, very small refrigerator; small coffee maker in room; hallways are small and seem dated.

I think this helped me get the room I wanted (and I highly recommend this approach - many ""bad"" reviews complain about not getting a good view). When making my reservation there was a ""special request"" box. I asked for a corner room as high up as possible (I'd booked an ""ocean view"" room). I was prepared to sweet talk / bribe my way to a great room. No need. I started my spiel and the hostess told me I was one floor from the top, on the corner - with a balcony view of the beach and a side view of Diamond Head. When I walked into the room I literally said ""Wow!""Location: Great location at the southeast end of the main strip of hotels on Waikiki Beach. Just cross the street and you're on the beach (right across from the jetty by Queen's Beach). Easy driving access (you avoid having to drive down the very busy Kalakaua Blvd and instead have quick access to Kapahulu - for arrival and departure). Shopping and restaurants are a 1-5 minute walk away. I saw some homeless people in the vicinity, but not in great numbers and they certainly weren't aggressive. Google map directions had me twisting and turning - just take Kapahulu towards the ocean - you can pull into the valet parking from either side of the road.Hotel: I walked through several other hotels during my stay. Some were very opulent - water features and large statues. Park Shore doesn't have these. No biggie - the lack of opulence didn't keep me awake at nights. The lobby is large, with comfortable seating - some right by the door for when you're waiting for pick up for tours.Staff: The front desk personnel were very friendly and helpful. The valet / bell staff were equally friendly. Cleaning service was effective - they did tend to visit early to mid-afternoon, but were willing to come back if you happened to be in the room.Room: Clean. Reasonably large room. Comfortable bed. Large closet with plenty of hangers. Drawer space was a tad limited. Plenty of counter space in the bathroom. Shower was consistently hot and easy to control the temperature. Room safe was large - could have held a laptop and everything else you might want to lock up. Mini-fridge was of adequate size. No microwave. Well lit. Lots of electrical outlets.Did I mention the view? Definitely pay for the ocean view room and mention you want a corner room on a high floor. I loved the views of the ocean. Very relaxing.Parking: $20-ish dollars per day. Valet only. This was the only slight annoyance. Do you tip when you drop off the car? Do you tip when you get the car back? How much? I freely tip valet parking when it is a convenience, but valet is forced on you here (I think this is consistent with most of the Waikiki hotels). I don't know the rules in that situation - and I'd rather pay an extra $5 per day and be told tipping isn't accepted.Summary: For the price you get great views, great location, and all of the amenities you could ask for during your stay in Waikiki. I don't know why you'd stay anywhere but the Park Shore!","Denver, Colorado","LostInColorado</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",218,5.0

Also, I was impressed by the comp. upgrade from the hotel since I was there for my honeymoon, even gave us a box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts...so instead of a regular mountain facing room, we were put in a partial ocean view room, which really was ocean view if you ask me.

When we originally booked this hotel we wanted a location away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. We found that this hotel located at the end of the strip was perfect for us. We did not want to spend our vacation shopping on the strip and rented a car to get around the island. We were able to jump in the car and head out exploring with minimal traffic to and from the hotel.  A few words about the staff. We have stayed at five star hotels that did not provide the level of customer service that we received from the staff at Park Shore. The front desk was helpful, professional, kind and courteous. They asked how we were enjoying our stay, made recommendations and provided directions when they saw us trying to navigate a map. The valet service was fantastic, I am a smoker and I always kid my husband when we valet park that I have plenty of time to smoke because it will take forever to get the car anyway, but this was not the case at the Park Shore. These guys were on it! We waited an average of 2-3 minutes to get our car EVERY time. The cost of Parking was $22 a day but after driving all over Oahu, I can tell you that cost is a bargain. We parked at the Sheraton Waikiki one night for a catamaran cruise we were taking and it cost $20 for 4.5 hours! The housekeeping staff was exceptional. Everything was clean and replenished daily and always without interrupting us. The one suggestion I would make here is that in the room there is a card saying if you hang up your towels you will reuse them, if they are on the floor they will be replaced. I expected the same type of notice in regards to bed linens, but did not find one. I don't need my bed linens changed everyday and would like to see that option as well. They have an activities desk in the lobby (this might be expedia) and they were very helpful booking us last minute tickets to the Paradise Cove luau. The Luau did not have any front row seating left, but the activities director requested they bump us up if they had a cancellation. When we got there we were seated in the front row! Fantastic! I give kudos to this team for helping to making our stay wonderful.

When we called the front desk to ask for a downgrade back to our original booking we got put in a corner room which, while still technically ocean front, was facing diamond head. Still haf an absolutely awesome view, but it wasn't as great as our room last year.

Look no further, you've found the right hotel.Without a doubt the Park Shore occupies the best piece of real estate of any 3 star hotel on Waikiki, and I know the area well. I'd first found this property a few years ago prior to their just completed renovation. The location on the makes for unobstructed views from the oceanview and oceanfront rooms. (We had oceanview - 12th floor.) There are a few in the partial oceanviewcategory that do provide a decent view as well, though you might find the proximity to your neighbor's balcony a bit disconcerning. I found all of the descriptions of and photos of room categories on the property's web site to be quite accurate. The very adequate pool on the third floor overlooked the ocean and a spacious stretch of beach just across the streetRegarding the renovation, our room had a well sized bathroom with tub and good counter space, a private lanai, and comfy king size bed with new ""Perfect Sleeper"" mattress. Rooms are on the small side (as is the case with most 3 star Waikiki hotels), but was fine for two on a ten day stay.Oceanfront rooms are slightly larger, as are the poolview rooms, the later furnished with two queen beds.A big plus was the quiet central air conditioning system, a feature not always found in more reasonably priced properties. The flat screen TV had a good assortment of channels. The coffee marker was fine for just that, though the many Australian guests longing for a spot of tea will find it just as inadequate for the purpose as all American models. The mini fridge was fine for beverages.We found the staff to be friendly and quite approachable. Any requests for information or services were immediately addressed. Should you require a king bed, you may want to make that request known to the property in advance.Rate wise, the Park Shore is one of the more reasonably priced 3 stars in Waikiki. In fact non oceanview rooms can be a bargain. These still have a lanai, and while they face another hotel, I've seen far worse in Honolulu. When comparing prices do note that the property does not charge a resort fee ($25-$30/night), nor do they charge for internet, often adding another $10-$15 nightly. Valet parking is very reasonable in the low twenties per night for those with a car.Aqua, the management category does work with traditional travel agents, so if you're booking far out, this may be a moneysaving option if you find one knowledgeable about Hawaii. Close in, shop around with their website and an agent. Rates do vary by season and overall hotel occupancy in Honolulu. The Park Shore Waikiki won't disappoint for those looking for a modern room with a view in the three star category. On our September visit we found mostly guests traveling as couples in a mixture of age groups. The hotel is definitely gay friendly.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Paul F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",23,5.0

The lanai was spacious with two chairs and a table to enjoy the view while having a glass if wine... Room was very clean, housekeeping service was great. Front desk staff was really nice also. There wasn't much noise while in the room but I think the hotel was not very busy during our stay. Free wifi all over the hotel. They have lemon water and juice in the lobby. They also provide beach towels. You get them at the front desk, up to four per room and must return by 8pm. Now let me tell you about the location. It was the BEST!!! Hotel is half block from Waikiki beach, across from the zoo. You can see the beach sitting on a chair in the lobby and it takes you literary less then a minute to get there. What do you say about that?!! :)) It's on the end of Waikiki away from the busiest part of it. Next to the hotel entrance there is a ABC store where you can get pretty much anything you may need during your vacation. There is a sports bar on the second floor that we only checked out but did not like. On the lobby level there is that awesome place for sandwiches and juices Tucker and Bevvy - great for breakfast (to go or you can sit in, they have some tables) and picnic food. Starbucks next door, plenty of restaurants all around. Yes, there are homeless people sleeping on the streets but they are pretty much everywhere by the beach and hotel can't control that. Felt safe any time of the day or night though. They have a room where you can change and take a shower even after you check out and they store your luggage. So if you are lucky enough to be on a redeye flight you can enjoy another beach day after you leave our room :)Overall great stay, great hotel. So happy I found that place. Thank you Park Shore! We'll definitely be back!!","Los Angeles, California","jivkas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",15,5.0

Thank you to the friendly hotel staff & the manager who happily placed us in the room we requested. Its a 50/50 chance to get the room you request so we were pleasantly surprised when it was available for us. Its in a great spot in Waikiki especially if you want to be in the mix of things without the noise of loud crowds... please don't pay attention to the silly wingers complaining about homeless people.. seriously why would you bother mentioning that?? This is a world wide issue, not just in Hawaii and it has nothing to do with the hotel! Besides, its not even a concern for guests, you rarely notice them when you're too busy taking in beautiful Waikiki beach & breath taking views of Diamond Head. The beauty of Park Shore is that its really fantastic value, most other hotels in such a popular tourist area will charge so many hidden extras, while Park Shore gives you extras at no charge (free internet, free use of beach equipment which is so handy.. grab a chair & umbrella & walk 20 steps to the best part of Waikiki beach, free cable,, free ice machine which is great on the way to the beach & an expedia expert in the lobby to help with tours etc it was actually cheaper for us to book our car through them than book online ourselves). Yes it's not 5 star, but it is 5 star for what you get considering the reasonable rates.Tip: the higher rooms with views of Diamond Head & Waikiki Beach are amazing, pure bliss!We loved Hawaii & its people so much, we are planning another trip soon & will be back at Park Shore.

Arriving at Honolulu international airport I had no Idea where to go for vehicle pickup, I fudged it and walked across to the middle carriage way and noticed vans with rental logo's on them, 15mins later my van showed up I hailed it down and was taken to pickup my rental car. I have no issue with this company they were polite and return was as simple as hand over keys and that was it. Nothing like the horror stories from past reviews.My room was the room that faces the other hotel no sea or Diamond Head view, a bit on the tight side for space but this could have all been forgotten if the coffee machine could just make boiling hot coffee. It could only make lukewarm at best and the icebox was not working, I complained and instantly they were replaced but the replacement coffee machine was the same lukewarm coffee, I gave up and bought coffee. Why don't they just have a hot water kettle and microwave oven? Parking valets were polite and cordial, I would stay here again.","Maroubra, Australia","upmiester</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maroubra, Australia</strong>",5,3.0

The 11th floor room facing the ocean AND Diamond Head was very nice. A quirky thing about the AC: it stops if the balcony door is not closed completely. I suppose this saves on electric energy and loss of efficiency to cool, so I think this is a nice thing to have.The parking was very expensive, but then again, where else can one park in that area? Certainly not at the zoo across the street. Still, at $22 per day, it is not what I would call a bargain,There are couple of ABC convenience stores at both corners and a Starbucks with a nifty deli place at the ground floor.I was not happy with the vending area, where there was a single, filthy, microwave oven with no utensils or crockery near by, The entrance is very close to the beach, but there was a number of homeless sleeping along any benches or close to the pathways leading to the hotel. Not a pretty or safe sight, either, but I suppose this is part of the territory.This hotel is definitely to be used as a base to visit Honolulu.","Houston, Texas","paokara1940</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",65,4.0

The location is fantastic. The hotel has been renovated so the rooms are updated and quite nice. The beds were comfy, the showers had the rainfall shower heads. It would have been nice if the bathroom had the clothesline that you could hang wet bathing suits to dry, as the balcony was likely to blow your drying items off. The front desk staff was fantastic. Nick helped us out a ton. One really nice touch was that they offered you the use of their hospitality suite to shower and change after we checked out since we had such a long time between check-out and our flight. This allowed us the opportunity to go to the beach and the pool and take in more fun. It was hard to figure out where to turn in for parking when we arrived, but we figured it out.","Acworth, Georgia","mandab113</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Acworth, Georgia</strong>",3,5.0

I just needed a base for myself and my 5 year old daughter to sleep while we explored the island. I did not want to stay in the middle of Waikiki, so the location near the zoo was perfect for us. And I did not need tons of amenities since I knew we would not be spending much time in the room.Let's start with the room. I have stayed in Waikiki before, but I have never had a room this small. There was literally no place to put our suitcase. I ended up stacking them on top of each other and still had to move them to get to the beds. I don't think there was even 2 feet between the two double beds in the room. The size of the room definitely called for 1 king size bed instead of 2 doubles. In addition, there was not enough bedding, just a super thin blanket and sheets. A thicker blanket is needed.Another problem is the noise. The doors are self-closing like most hotel doors are, but these were extremely heavy for some reason. Not only were they difficult to open, but if you did not hold on to the door as it closed it would slam VERY LOUDLY! We were woken countless times at all hours of the night be people's slamming doors- so loud in the echoing hallways it could almost be mistaken for a gunshot. Not to mention that the walls were incredibly thin and we could everything our neighbors were doing and everything that was being said in the hallways.Now for the service. The front desk staff were pleasant enough, but the people working valet were rude and did not seem to want to be there at all. And if you have a car, you have no choice BUT to valet. I misplaced my valet ticket and was berated by the valet attendant who proceeded to show me the cabinet of keys and asked me how I could expect him to find my key among the ones in the cabinet. I have never been spoken to in this way by a hospitality employee before. In addition, when I would pull my car up to have it parked the valet attendants would often just stand there doing nothing. I would have to get out of my car and ask them if it was okay to leave the car. And yes, I tipped every time I used valet, even though that would not have been a good excuse for this level of service anyway. AND I had to pay dearly for this daily ""service"".The location was good for what I wanted, but the driveway was extremely hard to get out of when driving. The zoo is literally right across the street, and there is decent beach in front of the hotel. There are several convenience stores and places to eat nearby as well. However, this street corner seems to be THE place for local drunks and bums to congregate. I am aware of (and used to) Waikiki's homeless problem, and I am not unsympathetic to the unfortunate, but this particular spot was inhabited by some very aggressive and very drunk people on a daily basis. We did not walk outside of the hotel after dark because of this. I know the hotel has no control over this, but it is something you should be aware of, especially if you are a solo female or traveling with young children.I will not be staying here again.","Inverness, United Kingdom","kamieberry</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Inverness, United Kingdom</strong>",96,2.0

Nick at the front desk was very nice and confirmed that we would get the roll-away bed that we had originally asked for.

When he went downstairs to hang in the lobby at 3 AM because he wasn't able to get a good night sleep given the change in plans forced upon us, he was confronted by scary big guys who stood around to intimidate him. We asked for a refund for the second night and all the nice PR person could do was to give us a very small fraction of our money back.

The location is great across the street from the Honolulu Zoo and 1/2 block from the Beach. The hotel itself is very clean and has been remodeled. I stayed on the 6th Floor, my room had a large screen t.v., 2 double beds, safe, mini refrigerator,balcony and full bathroom and was nicely decorated. The perks of the hotel is you get a free news paper daily, free wi-fi, you can request towels to utilize for the beach/or pool at the front desk and beach chairs. The pool is on the 3rd floor and is very clean and is not crowded, you can overlook the beach from the pool area which is a nice scene. You have a local Starbucks, ABC stores and new health food cafe next door which has healthy juices, gelato, sandwiches, hummus, etc for really reasonable prices for the location. Valet parking is good, you may come and go it is $22 a day. The freeway is a few blocks away from the hotel should you want to venture out. Another advantage is there are no resort fees. Many of the hotels in the area charge resort fees, but Park Shore does not. Also there is less noise in the location of the hotel, compared to other hotels on the strip and down the block.

Parkshore is the last hotel on east end of Waikiki strip to be away from the crowds and traffic. It is directly across the street from the beach and adjacent to Honolulu Zoo and Kapiolani park. I got a 14th floor room overlooking the beach but a smidgen of Diamond Head. The room was comfortable for myself and sons (12 & 16) with a king bed and full size pullout. The room was clean and I liked the minibar with utensils, sink, mini-fridge (which looked brand new). The staff and housekeeping were friendly and helpful. The pool was closed on a couple of occasions which we did not use because we were at the beach, snorkling excursions, shopping and dining. I rented a car for one day at the Budget located 2 blocks west in the Hyatt Regency and booked at Costco travel. I rented a car from Dollar for the last 2 days (Dollar picks you up to go their Waikiki location). I parked on an hourly basis at the zoo which meters $1/hour and allowed overnight parking. This was a cheaper option to valet because I was coming and going. You can checkout the hotel towels. The Starbucks next door was convenient but busy. LuLu's Restaurant is upstairs from there which offered open air dining from morning to night. The restaurant had an authentic surfer decor with great food and service. My kids liked that Stonecold Creamery and Subway were a few doors down. Teddy's Bigger Burgers is the opposite side of hotel which is an inexpensive option for good food (they also do take-out). Restaurants on the opposite end of the strip has long wait times for dinner. There is a grill on the beach that serves breakfast to dinner. This is my 5th trip to Oahu and 3rd stay on Waikiki. Don't expect a 5 star fancy resort with spa, buffet, exercise rooms, etc. I liked that this hotel was low-key and uncrowded. You can get inexpensive inflatable rafts and tubes from the plentiful ABC stores and lounge on the tranquil waters of Waikiki beach.
