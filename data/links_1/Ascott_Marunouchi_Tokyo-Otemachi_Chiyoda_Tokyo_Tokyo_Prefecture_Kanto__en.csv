Location great - near Tokyo Station and therefore lots of different dining options from cheap and cheerful to high class. Check in fast and efficient. Upgraded a room type due to Ascott status so a very positive start to the stay and hard to go backwards from there!Room was big and spacious and very well decked out. Huge bathroom with bath, with great amenities. Beautiful view over the area from the 25th floor. Comfortable beds. Well appointed kitchenette. Only real gripe is that while the furniture is relatively tasteful and functional, the decor is a bit twee - reminds me of a professional Airbnb fit out, especially the wall hangings which I suspect are identical in every room. Hallways also have pretty ugly carpet and trimmings, but the lobby and shared lounge and outdoor area were actually very stylish. Pretty nice gym, and a small indoor infinity 'gym' pool which is closed to children.Would stay again happily, but maybe more of a business hotel than a family hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","Propofool</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",3,5.0

The bathroom is especially nice, with the bath, toilet and and basin compartmentalized into three different sections. Bath salt and wash cloth are a nice touch. It felt really good soaking in a deep tub with sea salt after a long walk. The bathroom comes with a rain shower and another hand-held shower spray. I personally prefer the square-shaped rain shower head, this hotel installs a rectangular rain shower head. There is also a gap above the bathroom door so it will be impossible to create a steam shower, which is a pity.On my first night, though, I was bitten on my leg by a bug on the bed, leaving five very red and itchy bite marks that remained for days. I couldn't find anything on the bed. I called the hotel staff who sent someone to clean the room, but on the second night I was still bitten. The hotel did not offer another room until I requested it. There was no further follow up either. After that, no bug biting incident in the new room. However, on my last night of stay, I put on the pajama provided and my back started to feel itchy. Turned out there were mites on the pajama. Once I removed it, there was no more itch. Another note on housekeeping, I found a cup in the cupboard stained and had a few specks of black dust in it. There were also two hardened small stains in the bathtubs that were not removed.

My room this time (7night stay) had probably been upgraded and so i had a lounge as well as the standard bedroom with extra study space . Only issue is the restaurant. Poor or limited breakfast choice. The restaurant closes at weekends, and even on a weekday, lunch service is short. I heard one lady this morning being turned away because she was 5 minutes late arriving for last orders. She could have surely just sat and ate the buffet menu. The hot order food choices is fried eggs, omelette or scrambled eggs. Again that takes seconds to prepare. The food in buffet choices should be hot but i ate very cold sausages three days in a row. For a luxury hotel apartment i think this is poor. I also came back just a few minutes past three, asked if I could have a beer and nibbles in their restaurant but was turned away as they were only serving tea. Again no ""omotenashi"" mindset. Given it incredible cost, think they don't live up to the first class standards. And house keeping cut corners as the week progressed. Missing toilet roll, dirty un- emptied bins, missing dressing gowns, no slippers replaced, tea towel wet (ie not changed)... Needs to be reviewed hotel managers!

As with every hotel in Japan, everything was clean and is well maintained. Cleaning service did a great job of tidying up each morning. Front desk personnel were there to help answer questions and always welcomed us back. Internet here is amazingly fast and reliable.My only complaint was with the bath products they offer.

We like the wooden flooring, our kids will sit on the floor and eat which we do not allow on carpeted floor. The kitchenette is very useful - Ascott provides detergent and also wiping cloth. Location wise, we found it much easier to walk on the pavement rather than taking a subway to Tokyo Station. It feels shorter and we used Google Maps to navigate rather than the signage in the subways to avoid the many staircases underground. The hotel is friendly to businesses and families but it’s quiet in most areas - as we have 2 young kids, we avoid the breakfast and do not hang around much in the common areas/lobby.

Many times I do not write reviews because I cannot decide between 4 and 5 but this is a pure 5. Size of the room, places to put clothes and bags, kitchen, bed comfort, amenities' variety and quality, air conditioning, sound isolation were all good. Amenities and towels were replaced daily. Actually I was storing back the towels and there was no need to replace them daily. They were also changing the sheets daily. Thinking back maybe there was a paper to put on top of the bed, but had not noticed back then.Cleanness was top, though other places we stayed in Japan also had high hygiene standards. Even much more expensive hotels elsewhere in the world were nowhere near this cleanliness level.Our room was on one of the top floors. This was the best view of the city. I had been to a number of other recommended locations, but this was actually way better. Our room was facing the imperial gardens and then the rest of the city and one day we could even see mount Fuji. But even without this element the hotel would have been best one I've stayed in so far. It is sad that the restaurant does not have the view.Service was also very good taking into account these are served apartments. At the lobby floor there is also a foreign exchange machine. It does not have the best rates (around 5% above the rates in exchange offices of Japanese banks), but can be convenient.Location-wise: it is in the business district with lots of cafes and restaurants, especially on the ground and underground floors of the building nearby. Marounochi station is closeby. It is also close to shopping areas, but is still some distance from the main shopping areas and/or touristic places. But I have an impression you do have to walk a lot in Tokyo anyways due to big distances between public transportation stops or use taxi/uber.What can be improved:The only thing that comes to my mind variety and quality of black teas could be better.

The problem lies with the instructions front desk provided for travel to Haneda airport. I enquired front desk as to best method to go to Haneda airport and the attendant they told me the easiest way would be by metro. He explained to me it would be 1 change at Mitai station and I should take the red line train to the ""end of the line"" where I would be at Haneda airport, he said the trip would take 40mins. He also drew arrows on the metro map which indicated the starting station, changeover station and an arrow going all the way to the end of the red metro line with a star to alight at the last station. The following morning, I departed an extra 30mins early to ensure there would be no issues on the way. At the Mitai station there are actually 2 different (trains - 1 local which requires another change at the next station or the Haneda express airport train - however this was NOT explained by the front desk staff). In order to make sure we were going on the train for the airport I checked with the station attendant who confirmed I can take the next train which was a local train which would go to the airport. However, he did not say there would be another change over required and because I had been told there would be only ONE changeover, we stayed on the train for a further 3 stops until a train conductor kindly told us we should go back to to Sengakuji station to take the Haneda express. This confusion led me and my travel companion to miss our flight at Haneda airport and incur $2,500 in additional cost to re-book the flights. I contacted the hotel to request a full or partial compensation, or some type of resolution to this terrible experience. I received an phone call asking why I didn't call the hotel when I became lost (I was not aware that I was on the wrong train until the conductor told us to ""go back"" at which point we were definitely late so we were running and the Tokyo metro has signs saying ""turn off phone when crowded"" and no one was talking so we were not sure if it was allowed), and then the manager of the hotel told me it was my fault and the fault of the train attendant that we became lost. I also received an email from the manager offering no resolution with no responsibility taken for the poor directions of the front desk staff. I am still waiting for a satisfactory reply.

We booked way early.We checked in at around 9PM and were told that we were being downgraded to a Studio Apartment for the first night. As I went straight to complaint mode, the manager on duty explained that in return for the first night downgrade, we will be upgraded to a Two-Bedroom Executive Apartment, not only for the following night, but for the following nightS. Plural. Rest of the stay. I did not want to believe it until I saw it myself, but it happened. It was the second biggest room in the hotel.The Studio Apartment we spent on the first night was great. Great size, great bathroom, great kitchenette, great washer and dryer, great lighting, great Nespresso machine, great view of the garden, great value, great.But as we stepped into the Two-Bedroom Executive, great became fabulous. My brother and I got one bedroom, one bathroom, each. Extra spacious kitchen, wonderful dining and living area. Two people, three television.I calculate my travels mainly in two variables: how many times I say wow, and square meter. This establishment fulfilled both.I would like to personally thank you the Ascott Marunouchi Team for the generosity and hospitality.

No wonder all the bad reviews of this place is all about the Front Desk. Shame on these people. They we’re literally unwilling to call the restaurant for us to make a lunch reservation because we were checking out on the day itself (we asked them to book 2 days before our check out date). “Sorry but we can only help you with reservations during your stay” with a fake grin on his face. Completely unheard of even in a 3 star hotel. What’s so hard about making a 30 second phone call for a customer that has been living there for almost 2 weeks? We don’t speak Japanese and needed someone to make the reservation for us. A janitor would probably be happy to help us, but not the front desk. It’s baffling to know a newly built 5 star service apartment would do such a thing. Not sure what’s their intention, but definitely felt like they were doing it on purpose because were tourists. But shouldn’t you assist them more knowing that we are tourists?? Ritz, four seasons, boutique hotels and even transit hotels would be happy to assist you with this very simple request, but not The ASScott. Yes it’s a new building, yes rooms are decent, but don’t be surprised to have a hard time dealing with the front desk if you are staying here. This is just ONE of the MANY negative experience in our 2 week stay here. Have us 12pm late check out and anything later would be a full nights charge. Needed to print a new itenary for visiting family’s visa document but was again reluctantly to do so. Housekeeping did not replenish amenities and did not clean utensils well. List goes on and on... feels like I’m in a 5 star building with a motel like service. Very unwelcoming and unhelpful.

There is a washer/dryer which is really easy to use (use google translate to figure out Japanese symbols)- awesome treat for us on a 7 night stay... bathroom is great- best water pressure I’ve ever had in a hotel- with a smart shower/bathtub room- large tub- I’m 6’3” and was very comfortable able to fully extend my legs- which rarely happens! Best part of the suite- the bed!! Amazing bedding and the bed itself is firm and perfect!! Tons of storage- so if you are visiting for a while- this suite is perfect!! Several closets, storage drawers everywhere..Daily housekeeping is included- website states no cleaning on Holidays and Sundays however we received cleaning every day including a National Holiday and a Sunday... and it is amazing housekeeping!!! They cleaned the suite top to bottom every day!!!Absolutely recommend this property- great value (we paid roughly $300 USD when many other 5 star properties were priced between $500-$650 a night) very comfortable, and great location makes the Ascott ",Las Vegas,"travelman1973</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas</strong>",72,5.0

The washer/dryer worked well and a small package of detergent was provided by housekeeping daily.The best part about the room... the view. We were on the 27th floor (Rm 2702) and got to wake up to see a beautiful view of Tokyo (including Mt Fuji in the background). Lovely sunsets as well. The bathroom has a large window (with a shade you can close) that allows you to stand in the shower and look out as well, nice little touch - makes it feel more luxurious.The hotel itself is brand new (and just celebrated it's 1 year anniversary), very tastefully decorated - and though tends to cater to those traveling for business, was absolutely perfect for vacationing as well. Note that the hotel does have a restaurant but it's only open during the week and there is no room service or bar. The lobby is a beautiful, double-height space on the 22nd floor (the entire hotel is perched at the top of a business tower) and has access to a small pool and a decently equipped gym.Everything was extremely clean and spotless. Housekeeping did a lovely job keeping our room clean and there was no conflict with arriving back to maids in the room, it was always complete when we returned.The area is a business area, but the metro is located just steps from the hotel entrance. Lots of good food options within a 10-min walk so don't let the area deter you. It was very quiet at night, and very safe.HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you're looking for something different or ending a long trip in Tokyo (staying in a beautiful hotel and being able to do your laundry is a thing of beauty).","Brooklyn, New York","architecta</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",49,5.0

Staff are very friendly and greet you everytime you walk past the reception desk which is everytime you come and go from the hotel.

The room is very modern and very comfortable except a more comfy armchair would have completed this. The hotel location was convenient for Metro transport (connected to Otemachi station which is the main Metro interchange) although note it is still quite a walk to some Metro lines albeit underground and well signposted (in English) signage.

Everything about this hotel exude luxuries and elegance. Actually there are many restaurants surrounding the hotel. Right next to hotel entrance - there is another entrance that connects to the offices. You take the escalator to B1 and there are so many restaurants underground. The sushi bar was quite good, you may need to queue up if you are late. The underground also connects you to the Otemachi train station.If you walk few blocks, there is this row of restaurants underneath a bridge (i think its called Kitchen Street if not mistaken). Most of the office workers will patron there and the foods are quite good.During the day, you can check out the Imperial East Garden and the Palace which is just nearby.

We stayed there for 5 nights from 12/28 to 1/03. We had stayed in many luxurious hotels in Japan from my many trips to the country. I have to say for the price that we paid, the service didn't match. You can receive much better service from other hotels nearby such as The Palace Hotel, The Imperial Hotel and Oakwood Premier.They were nice enough to give our kids birthday presents (a box of cookies) which we really do appreciate. There are two things that I would like to point out though:1. I had asked repeatedly whether we could borrow their cart to transport our luggage to Hoshinoya (a very nice hotel 5 min away by walkling) to take the limousine bus to Narita. There are a few carts always sitting there not being used. They just wouldn't let you. They had no means of trying to help you. The property has no direct limousine to the airports. I had stayed in other hotels that would really try to make it easy for you by helping you with luggage, Ascott just didn't care. On the day we left, there were two male and one female employee outside on the first floor. The female staff was very kind. The male staff were just helpless. I asked if either of them can help us with just 1 luggage to cross the street, one guy told me "" you can just go to the street and try to find a taxi yourself"" while the other one just stood there yawning. That's the kind of help we received after having spent USD $2,500 there. Obviously they didn't care and didn't see that we were travelling with two children and had 5 pieces of luggage all together.2. On the day we checked left, I asked the front desk if it's possible to change our bus reservation time from 11:15 to 1:20 PM. The lady in the front desk said she would call Hoshinoya and let me know. 30 minutes later, she called back and said the 1:20 bus was cancelled. This seemed very unlikely in Japan that limousine bus would cancel for no reason. Upon 10:45 we arrived at Hoshinoya to buy the bus tickets. I asked the male employee from Hoshinoya "" Is the 1:20 bus to Narita cancelled?: He seemed very surprised and told me ""No, it's not cancelled"". At this point, I just was totally disappointed with the management and service of Ascott. Who should I believe? For the price that we paid, we could have chosen to stay at other luxurious hotels within the area. I would certainly try Hoshinoya next time we go back to Japan. When I walk in to buy the bus tickets, they really treated me with respect even though we were not hotel guests there. They way they welcomed you and helped you was very inviting.I had stayed in another serviced apartment hotels such as The Oakwood Premier. I have to say Oakwood excelled in every way. The location, the service and management. I would certainly stay there again if I was going to choose this type of accommodation.When you stay in Ascott, the general feeling that we get is they don't really care to go out of their way to help you. They do their basic stuff and that is all. If you are looking for service then I suggest The Imperial, Hoshinoya and The Palace Hotel. You will be much happier there.",California,"Janice W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",12,1.0

Very centrally located in the center of a very nice business district. The Ascott is right on top of a Metro station so you don't have to go far to catch a train. Interestingly enough you can walk underground from this station to Tokyo station, and vice versa. I wish I would of known that when we arrived! We stayed in a Studio and a 1 bedroom during our stay to try them both out. The Studio is plenty of space for 2 people. It has a kitchenette and a bathroom with a window that opens up into the main bedroom. If you need privacy there is a shade you can lower. The 1 bedroom is separated by a living room in the middle from the kitchen and bathroom areas. The shower in the 1 bedroom was my favorite, although I wish it had a window to the outside. Additionally the 1 bedroom had a Washer and Dryer combo unit in it. This was amazing because we could do our laundry before returning home. It was nice to pack another clean bag of clothes and not worry about it on our return. No bar here, except on the weekends. Easy to get to, great place to stay, worth your money if you want something cozy and nice. Way better than a loud hotel. However there is no bar. The pool here was pretty nice and the gym as well.

It is also right next to Chiyoda Park (Palace I remember).This time, we stayed at 29/F, the top floor and with the Chiyoda Park view. It was amazing and we can even see the Mount Fuji from our room (though small one) !Due to the location, we even have a closer view than that from Aman Hotel behind us.We also tried out the gym when we stayed.

I know that they never said that each room will have it's own washing machine, but after staying in other hotels in Tokyo, i believe that there will be at least a laundry room somewhere in the hotel. So after checking in, i asked for the laundry room because i noticed that there isnt a washing machine in our room. The woman actually looked around in the closet but eventually said that there is none in the room and there is no coin laundry in the building. So i asked we we could be moved to another room with one. She said if you opted for an extra bed (for my son), then you ll get no washing machine (which i thought was a bit weird since the washing machine is in the closet and its not going to interfere with the space used for the extra bed) but i said okay, can we get a room with the extra bed AND the washing machine? She said yes. SO we packed our things and went downstairs to the lobby to get a new room. The man said, this room will have a washing machine but the extra bed is not yet prepared, i said fine we will wait. He gave us a new pair of keys and we went up. The room has a washing machine. So we just have to wait for the extra bed. After about 10 minutes the man called our room and said we cant have an extra bed and a washing machine. I asked if we could just pay for an upgrade so we can have both. He said yes we can, for 2,400Y a night we can have an executive room. Now, i already had my suspicion because 2,400Y for an upgrade per night in Ascott Marunouchi would be considered nothing short of a miracle. So we went downstairs to the lobby - again - to pay for the upgrade and get our new room keys. The bill was for 24,000Y per night. I smiled, sighed and paid because my suspicions were correct. Anyway, it was smooth sailing after that. We got a new room. It was huge by Japanese standard. It features 2 full closet, 1 full size shoe closet, a fully equipped kitchen, a washing machine and other standard features of a five star hotels. The cleanliness as always perfect in Japan. You can go straight to a food court and the Metro lines without ever going out of the hotel itself. Very useful if you're staying in the hot month of July.

All in all, it looks 5* and it feels 5*!Location is good – quiet, and overlooking the Royal Palace.

The place is immaculate, extra clean, very modern, with outstanding staff and service (special thanks to Mari and Maki), great and spacious rooms with hard wood floors and very well designed. Extremely comfortable beds and pillows with both bath and shower. The Nespresso coffee machine a big plus! The location is fabulous in the midst of the financial district with wide and clean sidewalks and very centrally located (FYI New Yorkers, comparable to mid-town Manhattan), 1/2 a block from the Otemachi train station that connects to all key lines. In just minutes you could access all the sightseeings and key areas. It is 4 blocks away from the Tokyo station which is key to travelling to Kyoto and other out of town places with the Shingansen bullet train. All you may need is at your door step from convenience stores to restaurants, Starbucks coffee, metro, ATM's, banks, currency exchanges etc. Can't say enough about it! Book it and you won't regret it! We didn't book the breakfast because we did not want to be constrained by the hours of service; nevertheless, we found the price a bit out of line.
