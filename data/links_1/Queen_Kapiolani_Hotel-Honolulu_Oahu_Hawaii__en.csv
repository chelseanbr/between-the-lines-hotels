We can't recommend it highly enough. We splurged for their Premier Ocean View room and it was worth every penny and more. The view from this room was the best we've ever had at any hotel we've stayed at in our 37 years of marriage. First, the location is excellent if you don't want to be stuck in the middle of all the high rises in the middle of Waikiki while looking at the side of a building from your window/balcony. Our room looked out at unobstructed views of Diamond Head to the east and the Pacific Ocean and the beach to the south. Plus, the Kapiolani Park is right below and spreads out to the east. So, you can go over there and walk around and see whatever events are going on. While we were there there was a local artisan fair going on. And a few minutes walk away there is a wonderful little cafe/restaurant right on the beach where you can go for breakfast or lunch called the Barefoot Beach Cafe. Don't miss that! You can order your food and eat it in the open air right next to the ocean. The rooms are very nice and clean, but not the most modern you will find. But, the location is the main thing here. The staff was great. Always friendly and welcoming. The restaurant there is fine, but you have so many options nearby that you don't have to eat there. Overall, you can't beat the value given the incredible views.",Michigan,"KurtH_77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Michigan</strong>",0,5.0

Check in was easy and we got a fresh lei which was a really nice touch! LOVED the gym - wow, what an awesome gym. TRX straps, bosu balls, kettleballs, lots of equipment, spacious! They even have a yoga class!Overall the staff, room, facilities and location were awesome and we'd definitely stay again. Just a few downfalls, mentioned below.Downfalls:- Resort fee is steep, $40 a day. The pool area is really nice though and their bar is awesome. Nice to be able to get a drink/food by the pool!- Elevators are slow! Seems like it took forever to get an elevator (and there's three of them!) plus there's no stairs. We were on the fourth floor and would have taken the stairs if they were available.- Parking! $45 a night for parking is ridiculous! We were planning to use the zoo across the street, but they recently changed to hourly, with a four hour max at a time. So much for parking there overnight too - they lock the lot up after hours. Parked at Waikiki Banyan - $80 for the five days we were there. Literally two blocks away - well worth it!- Coffee - we had NO coffee maker in our room. Resorted to spending $4 a day on a small black coffee. Ridiculous prices and not great breakfast selection at their ""cafe"". Do yourself a favor and walk two buildings down to Starbucks or we found a little gem of a hole in the wall (crappy coffee but it's $1!!) called Waikiki Beachside Kitchen - great spot to get cheap food too!- Shower/water temperature - scalding hot water. Was like a science experiment to get the right temp. Would have the sink facet to cold and hot water would come out. Shower water pressure was like an erupting geyser. Way too hard!

If you couldn’t find a parking they suggested a cheap parking structure near by . We had studio ocean room . It was very tiny but we weren’t planning on being in the room much so didn’t care . The restaurant , lobby and bar area were all very nicely decored. The breakfast needs more choices as the buffet looked lack luster and there were only 4 other non buffet items to choose from.

This location is really fantastic, the staff is extraordinarily service minded and friendly, the restaurant serves great and delicious food, and the pool area was great as well. The front desk was really helpful when we checked in bca our travel agent had made a mistake and cancelled our stay. No problem, the front desk sorted things out, and we got our suite. This hotel has every opportunity to become an amazing 5 star hotel. But! One night in our room in the dark my son stepped on a huge cockroach with bare feet!! We asked the front desk to remove it (we had captured it under a cup) and we complained about it. They replied that these cockroaches fly and “are impossible to keep out”. Well, we have never seen cockroaches in Hawaii hotels indoors before this. And we certainly don’t expect or accept them in our room. Another huge cockroach lived on the ceiling in the hall way right outside our door, eventually fell to the floor and hung out there a couple of days until we asked the cleaners to remove it. Why didn’t the cleaners see it themselves? The interior decorations of our suite was very outdated, basic, and non-luxurious. Only one of the bathrooms had been renovated and looked nice. The toilet in the old bathroom got clogged and all the toiletwater ran out on the floor. Furthermore, the wrap-around lanai, however big, just looked like a dirty roof with a railing.

Found out later this hotel mostly caters to locals so I suspect they are boosting ratings. Booked a Diamond Head view room with a balcony. The room was very dated, especially the bathroom that needed a major renovation. We never got our room cleaned even though we put the tag outside our door. Very few towels are given in the room and of poor quality. There are water stations on certain floors but you need to bring your own cups or bottles. Would have preferred having bottled water in the room instead. The icing on the cake was after spending the day in Turtle Bay and having the long drive back to be told by valet they had no room for my car. They had the nerve to send me to another property with no guarantee they could accommodate me. I asked to speak with the manager Allan who basically said we had to go elsewhere. Not the answer I wanted to hear at 12 am and tired from the long drive. Pictures on the website are not what they appear except the pool area and lobby are updated. Check out at 11 am is rather early compared to other hotels check out at 12 pm. Calvin the bellhop was super friendly though.

Best part about this hotel is the location - About 1 block off the beach and on the last street of the ""concrete jungle"" of hotels, facing a park and the Zoo across the street. Much quieter than the center of Waikiki. Easy walking distance to downtown Waikiki and less touristy restaurants in nearby residential areas.2. Great views (and selfies) of Diamond Head from hotel pool and bar.3. Reef safe sun lotion provided in a dispenser by the pool (BYO small container to refill).CON'S1. Even though the hotel is recently renovated, it's still a 1960's-style floor plan. The balcony of our ocean view room faced dozens of hotels, not the ocean. The bathroom is small and cramped, with no place to easily hang wet swimsuits.2. Beach Chairs are available (for free) at the Bell Desk. However, a few days, we were told there were no chairs available. We later found out there are only about 30 total chairs for hundreds of rooms/guests. We noticed some guests keeping chairs for the duration of their stay, assuring them chairs every day.3. Maid service was spotty. We didn't get our room cleaned 2 days during our 7-day stay, despite being gone from the room for 5 hours during the day. The front desk told us maid service stops at 3:30p.4. We were lucky to score a great nightly rate without a resort fee, but honestly, I would not be as happy with my stay if we paid a higher price (not excellent enough to justify a high price and/or additional resort fee). This is a hotel, not a resort.MORE TIPS1. Be sure to look at ALL rates on the page for a rate without a resort fee; these seemed to be more towards the bottom of the page.","Newport Beach, California","SunshineGirl2929</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport Beach, California</strong>",228,4.0

I was quickly checked into my room on a high floor, and given poker chips to use for discounts at the bar/breakfast. Unfortunately the room itself left much to be desired- it had a lovely ocean view but was old and in desperate need of renovation, particularly the bathroom which was stained and just felt old. Given what I paid for my one night stay this was all more than adequate, and given how lovely the property is, I am happy to give this spot 4 stars, but the room itself was no better than a 3 star property.

Check is was a breeze as we were welcomed with traditional leis and our bags were brought up by the concierge.

I called and asked to upgrade to a larger room, none where available until 3 days into our 9 day stay. But, they made the upgrade to a huuuuuuge corner room with a lanai and views of both the ocean and the city (at no extra charge-much to my amazement!). The service from almost everyone we encountered on the property was just exceptional - everyone exhibited the true spirit of aloha. I only had one negative experience at the Deck restaurant: We sat for 15 minutes with no service and left, which turned out to be a great opportunity to grab a burger around the corner at Teddy's Bigger Burger (worth it). This property was quiet, beds are comfortable, had a phenomenal view of Diamond Head, was very clean & accommodating. I do have to mention that the pool is ""inside"" the Deck restaurant, so, if you plan on swimming you WILL have an audience. Valet parking is expensive, park one block away for the weekly rate and walk.

The front desk and valet teams are amazing and so friendly - they helped make our honeymoon stay so special. The location is perfect. It's at the very end of the main Waikiki strip, so is much quieter in terms of street noise than other hotels (we stayed in another hotel more in the thick of it later during our trip, so I can confirm from first-hand experience). That said, it was a very short walk to everything with restaurants and shops no more than two minutes away. The beach is an easy five-minute stroll. We had beautiful sea views and it was awesome to see Diamond Head from Deck, especially after doing the trail during our stay. It was so easy to find the hotel even after a long, long day of flights to get there and valet parking was always quick and easy. Parking in Honolulu can be a bit of a nightmare, so this was a great luxury. We explored the entire island from our base at the Queen Kapiolani and it was easy to get to every corner of Oahu from there. The lobby area is gorgeous. It's exactly what we hoped for - always beautiful music playing, it's open plan and breezy - and even more lovely than the pictures. The shops are great and we got some lovely prints from the art store. Our room was lush and spacious, and the bed was so comfy. The hotel was so clean, modern, and welcoming. I'd love to stay here again.","Leeds, United Kingdom","Allllliiiii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

That's good in that it means great, uncrowded park area all to one side of the hotel and keeps views from being blocked. On the other hand, it means a longer hike back into the heart of Waikiki. For us that was fine because we don't mind a walk. My biggest problem is with the expense of the hotel's restaurant. When we were there, they left a gift of a $5 credit for breakfast at the hotel. Turns out that was not even enough to buy a cup of coffee. So just don't eat there.

We booked a King room. The lobby is warm, light filled and artwork is very nice. Check-in was easy, we left our bags as we were a few hours early before check-in.Room was smaller than expected and we had a view of the hostel deck and bathroom next door. We tried to change rooms but they didn't have any nor were we able to pay to upgrade. No worries, we made do. No real drawers and no fan in the bathroom. We were on floor 3 - same as restaurant. Thankfully it wasn't too loud. Location of the hotel is what makes it really great. Although you are not on the beach, you're a block and a half away. The bellmen has beach chairs and beach towels for you to use. Deck next to the pool was also nice, great view of Diamond Head. Even though we were in December, it was never super busy. It's less busy near the hotel and an easy walk to restaurants and shopping. Loved that we could get Dole whip from Aloha Whip in the lobby. Also loved that there were water filling stations. Would have loved pool service from the Deck restaurant - we have to throw on clothes and shoes to walk to the bar to get drinks/food. We never ate at the Deck restaurant. Would have considered breakfast but their main push is a $30 buffet and they have very limited a la carte items. To be honest, I think they would do better with breakfast with more a la carte items. No worries, we were able to walk to other places for breakfast.I would stay here again - the updates are nice as compared to some of the other hotels we saw. I would just spring for a nicer room.","palo alto, ca","another650traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>palo alto, ca</strong>",58,4.0

The lobby is beautiful and the front desk staff were welcoming. We were greeted by Nolli (sorry if I am spelling that wrong) and he was very helpful when we asked about upgrades. We loved our room and the view of Diamond Head. However, we thought we were getting a good deal when I booked the hotel through American Express - it seemed very fair priced and comparable to other hotels in the area. Unfortunately, you are surprised with a daily hospitality fee of $35 and a valet/parking fee of $45 nightly - making the hotel a little more expensive than I anticipated. It would have been nice if American Express disclosed that upfront or if it was just charged to your card when you book with the rest of the fees. They have a text in your questions/requests option which I thought would be awesome but the staff took sometimes up to an hour to reply - so usually I would just call down or walk down to the lobby instead. They also had an option to scan your valet card so your car would be ready when you got downstairs but when we tried it the valet said “oh it’s off” when we went down... luckily they were fairly quick at getting our vehicle.Overall, I liked the look of the hotel. Clean and comfortable. The coffee bar and the shops in lobby were great. Their restaurant “The Deck” is wildly overpriced but they have some good Happy Hour and daily specials. The pool is right next to the restaurant which is a little weird. Would I come back? Probably... but more prepared to pay for the extra fees and I would absolutely not bring a vehicle.

It is a charming older hotel, remodeled and updated very nicely in 2018. Rooms and common spaces are now modern and well maintained, and the staff are over-the-top friendly and welcoming. My housekeeper, Mata, took great care of me during my stay - she respected my ""do-not-disturb"" sign when it was posted (for several days at a time), and then jumped into action and cleaned and freshened my room quickly when my ""please clean room "" sign was out. The guys running the valet parking desk were also great - I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my car to be brought around. The Front Desk staff are always smiling and offering a sincere ""Aloha!"" at any time of the day or night. The Diamond Head views from ""The Deck"" restaurant and bar and pool area are outstanding. The hotel is in a great location - at the quieter end of Waikiki, but just a short walk to the beach and the rest of the action. Better still, the hotel is literally across the street from the beautiful Queen Kapiolani park which is great for walks or runs before or after work/fun.

A 7-10 minute walk will lead you to more upscale dining.-The linens in the bathroom are delightfully coarse. Not sandpaper, but just enough to give you a gentle exfoliation as you wash or dry. Additionally to the complimentary toiletries, the hotel also offers samples of a reef safe sunscreen. It doesn't smell the best, but it will do in a pinch.-The shower in the room has fantastic water pressure. I was able to rinse off quickly and be on my way.-There's plenty of open shelving space in the room for you to put your belongings, and still see them. Greatly reduces the risk of leaving something behind.-The iron in the room is top-notch. Usually hotel irons are kind of iffy in terms of efficiency, but this thing is better than the one I have at home! #NoWrinkles-The hotel provides two free reusable water bottles for guests to keep and to stay hydrated while on the island.-There are plenty of outlets in the room-The room also comes equipped with some kind of plug in flashlight. When not in use it remains plugged into an outlet on the headboard. As soon as it is removed, it emits a very bright white light-There are also reading lights on either side of the bed-There are water and ice machines on every other floor.-The Deck Bar is a great place to unwind at the end of the day. The drinks are pretty good and the bartenders are awesome!-There's a coffee shop in the lobby which also sells snacks and light bites. There is also a small shop in the lobby that sells Dole whip (pineapple sorbet), ice cream and other snacks.-Despite what the front desk may tell you, there is a microwave in the hotel (it's in the coffee shop in the lobby)CONS-I asked for room on a the highest floor to prevent the noise of people walking overhead. Even though my room ended up being on a middle floor, the staff told me that they would put me in a quiet room. Unfortunately, their idea of a ""quiet room"" is right next to a Groom's Suite, with a steady stream of people entering and exiting the room and talking loudly at 5:30 in the morning. After that, it was generally more quiet (although I could hear maintenance and/or housekeeping servicing neighboring rooms through my walls). Definitely not the ""soundproof"" rooms that they boast on TripAdvisor, but at least there was no overhead noise.-Wi-Fi strength fluctuates a bit-Not a fan of the in-room toiletries. The reef safe sunscreen smelled awful. Definitely recommend avoiding that stuff. The Hawaiian Tropic shower gel barely foamed, and I was very glad that I brought my own. The body lotion was not moisturizing at all... Which was pretty surprising. that saltwater can strip the moisture right out of your skin and I really thought that this lotion would be better suited to combat that. Again, glad I brought my own stuff.-Front desk staff are not as knowledgeable about the hotel as they should be. (see comment in the ""PROS"" section regarding the microwave in the coffee shop) -The ice machines are a bit inefficient. They have shallow drip trays that need to be emptied regularly, and the ice dispenses oddly. More of it gets in the drip trays then actually gets in the water bottles provided by the hotel. They didn't think that configuration through very well.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","msfiyah01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",139,4.0

You're also right in front of the zoo and not too far from the aquarium. I also walked to Diamond Head one day, and it's very easy to get to from this hotel. Knots Coffee and the Aloha Whip are also conveniently located on the main lobby of the hotel, both have great soft serves and ice coffees which I had more than once (The Queens Cappuccino and Tokyo Soft Serve at Knots are to die for). The rooms are very beautiful, I had a studio queen with an ocean view. Each room has multiple USB charging ports so you don't have to worry about getting your electronics charged. I love the Hawaiian Tropics shower gel, shampoo and lotion, I actually wish I could buy these, cause they smelled so nice. The only downside about the room was the air conditioner was super loud and I often had to turn it off just to sleep. I also used the gym a couple times, and for a hotel gym it was pretty good, did the job and was never busy (a huge plus for me). I would definitely stay here again, probably get a room with a balcony next time.","Vancouver, Canada","jmcheung3480</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

Fresh renovations, friendly staff, covered parking, reasonable room rates, and a beautiful view of Diamond Head, the zoo, and a section of Waikiki Beach made our staycation very enjoyable. The location is at the zoo end of Waikiki which is the less busy end. There was a free evening Sunset at the Beach outdoor concert (we loved hearing Henry Kapono singing from our room) and family movie right across the street from our hotel that weekend. We walked to try the wonderful Morimoto Asia restaurant (7 minutes) and we saw the Hilton Hawaiian Village Friday night fireworks from the beach. The breakfast takeout from the restaurant in the hotel was overpriced but we had some more reasonably priced breakfast takeouts from nearby shops. The bed was very comfortable and the a/c was nice and cold. Next time we want to book the Diamond Head view rooms for a great forward view and hopefully no other rooms blocking the side mountain view. We liked the relative quiet on this side of Waikiki and my husband got to do a little bit of bodysurfing right across the street. I also liked the historical paintings of the Hawaiian monarchs in the gallery on the lower level. Note: There is a $100 hold on the room on your credit card until the final payment is made which you may not be informed of right away like me.

Kawai and Calvin at the bell desk are always on spot to assist with anything, demonstrating just the right balance between professionalism and friendliness. Staff stability is one reason I continue to return. This is my fourth visit since the last renovation and it is nice to see continual changes and good maintenance. The Deck restaurant is nice but pricey, but you cannot beat the view. Nice ever-changing selections of beverages at the Knots Coffee Roasters. Good service and friendly staff. I know it is a trade off for having the nice coffee shop, but I do miss the in-room coffee. I want to leisurely get up in the morning, sit on the lanai with a cup of coffee and watch a sunrise I cannot get at home - without having to dress and make my way to and from the lobby. I know some suite rooms have coffee makers, but those are not rooms of which I am interested. Beachy decor and open design makes the small bathroom more than adequate. I am not a fan of wall attached communal soap and shampoo, so the individual Hawaiian Tropic bottles are appreciated. Inclusion of reef friendly sun screen is a big plus (not only for usage but to help educate visitors). Hot water was plentiful on the top floor with good pressure, towels were thick, linens clean. The fact some of the windows open is a plus, as when the Trade Winds are blowing it is delightfully tropical. I rarely had the ac turned on. This hotel is across the street from the zoo. It allows for a gorgeous unobstructed view on the Kapahulu side. The zoo animals are a lively happy bunch and you will hear them chattering all day long. Hawaii is lovely, but busy, and Waikiki is no exception. The Queen Kapiolani is on the far edge of Waikiki. Across from the zoo it offers amazing less obstructed views of the ocean or Diamond Head if you are willing to pay for those rooms. If you are looking for a room that offers more than just a place to sleep, the Queen K Diamond Head and Ocean View rooms may be in order. As I have noted in the past, you get what you pay for here, but the view is quite worth it. I have stayed in a variety of rooms in this hotel, and upper floor -02 end stack of rooms are roomy with amazing views.

Its walking distance to everything that you can imagine. Its across the street to the ocean and beaches. Police everywhere. Its an older hotel. It was clean and quiet. PARKING is ridiculous and they NEED to do better !!! They dont tell you that there is no place to park anywhere in the area. They ONLY have valet parking which cost $40 a day !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! They should be ashamed of themselves. We spent over $200 in parking fees for that hotel. The hotel is definitely NOT WORTH $200 in parking fees. Its just an average hotel and there are many other good hotels (Marriott) that surround it. I think this hotel is a bit over priced for its age and amenities. They offer beach view rooms but its actually NOT on the beach. You have a view of the Diamond Head mountain / volcano and you MIGHT see parts of the ocean in the far distance. The ocean is across the street but its not directly across the street. There are many obstructions blocking your views.

I went to the front desk to see about getting a room that has a King size bed and a upgrade was offered to me at an additional price[$192-$197]. I paid a good price for my flight and hotel[8 nights] and having to pay for a room that I should have received from the beginning was insulting. To add insult to injury, the additional charge of almost $375.00 in ""Resort Fees"" is crazy. Now the ""Resort Fee"" is for things in the hotel that at one time was included in the price[pool, weight room etc], I don't use those things so to be charged extra, pure greed.

Arrived early before our room was ready. No problem, stowed our bags with bellman, went to the 3rd floor to the pool and Deck restaurant. Had our first Mai Tai, Kobe sliders and French fries. Everything was tasty! View of Diamondhead was beautiful. There were plenty of empty chairs around the pool, a shaded canopy area if you want that. Towels available (no towel card needed!) and a sunscreen dispenser, which I thought was genius! Only were there about an hour when we got a text that our room was ready. We were on the 7th floor, overlooking the pool. Some oceanview and Diamondhead. Room was smallish but I get the impression most rooms are small on Oahu. No balcony but we didnt mind, we were only in room to sleep. Mini-fridge in room, water bottles included with water filling stations every other floor. I thought that was great so we didnt need to buy bottled water. Hawaiian Tropic toiletries in bathroom, good water pressure and hot water. The safe in the room was big enough to hold my iPad. The Queen is at the Diamondhead end of Waikiki, next to the zoo (dont worry, no noises or smells) and about a block back off of Kalakaua Avenue, the main drag. The plus of that is that it is less congested from all the business of Waikiki and quieter. The negative in that, for some people, is that you would have further to walk to get to the center of Waikiki. It usually took us about 15 minutes or so to walk to the area of the Roysl Hawaiian. It wasnt an issue for us but could be for some people. They also had complimentary beach chairs by the bellman. Dont know how many were available but we had them most of our trip. I believe they also had boogie boards. Towels for beach were also located there.Staff were helpful and friendly. We booked online directly through the hotel. They had a fall special where we got a discounted rate on the room plus they waived the resort fees, which is huge. So glad we stayed here compared to some of the other places we were considering.

First thing to note is that this space isn't a resort, but an exceptional hotel. The room and bathroom was very clean and white. I loved the modern decor. The artwork in the room and lobby was beautiful and uplifting.Comparing to resorts in Waikiki, it doesn't have the luxurious pool areas they do, but I think in other ways it's just as good. The service was terrific. They always greet you when you arrive. The lobby is beautiful, open air, and a nice place to sit and relax.I think the location is the best in Waikiki because its across from a lovely park and the beach nearby is not as crowded as in other parts. And it is a block away from the beach - so close.The views of Diamond head are stunning. The free water bottles were a nice touch.Finally, I was sick at the start of the trip and had to miss a few days. We provided a doctors note and they kindly reimbursed us.

If staying in Waikiki area, you’d be hard pressed to find a better place in this price range. The location is exceptional being right at the beach in a quiet area with a great view of Diamond head, yet still walking distance to the action of Waikiki. The style of the hotel is very modern with open space and cool art work. Note, I would say this hotel is more geared towards couples and young people. The pool and other spaces are not really designed for kids.The staff was very friendly and we had no issues throughout our stay. Our room was also very comfortable and clean with a design that matches the rest of the property. I’d also make sure if you are staying that you have a meal at The Deck - the mashed potatoes are to die for.Just a few things that kept me from giving this place 5 stars:1. We got an ocean view studio room (7th floor). The ocean view is slightly misleading. Yes, you can see the ocean, kind of. But even so, you’ll want to keep your blinds closed most of the time since the room also faces your neighbor’s patios and the pool.2. There was a LARGE gap between our room door and the floor so that we could hear any noise coming from the hallway and anybody walking past would be able to hear into our room.3. The room is a bit cramped in areas, but manageable.4. Some of the renovations were not done properly as some of the fixtures were loose and other obvious mistakes.5. The water stations on the various floors were often “out of service” meaning there were times we had to try multiple levels of the hotel to find water.Overall, though, we still REALLY like this hotel and would stay here again if on the island. But we’d try upgrading to a bigger room that doesn’t have someone else’s patio right outside the window.","Phoenix, Arizona","kdub_lewis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",54,4.0

The bathroom was small and the beds rock hard, but they tried to make it better by sending up more pillows. There is also no coffee/tea making area in the room and I had to call down twice to get a kettle and cups and then they forgot to bring it up again until several hours later it finally arrived! The deck is a cute restaurant beside the pool, but the fake grass around the pool made it feel like a motel all over again, not to mention that there is a very large power antenna that sits adjacent to the only comfortable loungers that didn’t make me feel like I was in beautiful Hawaii. The staff was nice though and the location for being close to shopping and the beach was good. I just couldn’t get past the slightly dressed up motel vibe and this being such an old building.

Wonderful views and nice clean hotel, fantastic gym and the food at the deck was pretty good. Gerald the person who looked after our room for the whole visit was fantastic, such a wonderful ambassador for the hotel, always had a smile, engaging and friendly (and also did a great job in our room). The lobby staff were also so very friendly and helpful always. The room itself was nice and spacious (although not large) as well.Cons: We appreciate the openness of the lobby area with fans etc and a Hawaiian theme, however on a very hot day, I think most people expect to walk into a hotel (which is not inexpensive) and have some cool air. The coffee shop on the bottom floor is quite ordinary we thought; the person on reception that we spoke with on arriving was initially very helpful, however when we were advised we had a room on the 7th floor, we queried as we had engaged directly with the hotel by email seeking advice on what rooms are on the high floors and were advised ocean view junior suites were from the 9th floor upwards which is what we booked. Rather than accepting what we advised, we were then asked to produce the emails (which we did) we found this extremely disappointing. The matter was addressed and we were provided a room on the top floor, although we were urged to still take the 7th floor room. We do believe that the hotel is expensive for the nicer rooms, particually if compared to even some of the 5 star resorts. Although we had coffee making facilities in our rooms, unless you are booking the more expensive rooms, there is none, we believe this really is unacceptable.

However, didn't think it was worth close to $300cad a night here after tax and the astronomical resort fee ($38 US a night after tax). With that price I would expect an ocean view or even a diamond head view room, but we got a room just facing the concrete jungle of Waikiki. We did a very small partial view of the ocean because we were on the 18th floor in the corner of the room or the balcony. This hotel is newly renovated but most of the renovation I believe is just superficial, you can definitely still feel the old motel room feel of the room. Even the window and door is not very sound proof, we can hear the street noise with ease. With a 4 star hotel you would expect and coffee & Tea in the room but there was no complimentary coffee nor tea. There wasn't even any cup to use in the room, except for the 2 in the bathroom, after speaking with front desk they did bring up 2 mugs for use to use and a kettle.

We took a sneak peak at the room facing diamond head and the ocean and the view looked amazing, so I don't know how much extra you have to pay for that, but at $300cad probably another $50 a night for the view. I would consider paying the extra for the view if i stay here again. The gym is modern and its 24hrs, we got a few work outs in there. They have free yoga class and also free surfing class to guest, we took advantage of yoga and working out infront of the view of diamond head is quite enjoyable. The bed in the room is very comfortable to sleep in. The best of all about this hotel is probably the people who work there, everyone we encounter were very friendly and helpful. Gave us coupon code to waive resort fee on next stay, might consider staying without the hefty resort fee.","Vancouver, Canada","AlfietripA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",35,3.0

The hotel was nice with a beautiful lobby and friendly staff. We were on the mezzanine floor so being the weekend of course the noise from the street was loud at night, but not overwhelming, we were so tired we passed out anyway! What was more bothersome than the street noise was the balcony door would consistently rattle or make noise as if someone was bumping it from outside, but it was just the wind.

We stayed in a premier ocean view room (#1709), which overlooks the ocean and city. At first, we were a little disappointed that our room didn't look onto Diamond Head as pictured on QK's website, but we got the promised, gorgeous panoramic ocean view, so we couldn't really complain. The bedroom was spacious and efficiently cooled by the quiet AC system, despite being in direct sunlight all day. The bed was also very comfortable. The bathroom was tiny but got the job done, and the bath linens and awesome Hawaiian Tropic toiletries were replenished without our having to ask. If you need towels for the pool, there are plenty available poolside, and if you need ones for the beach, you can grab them from the concierge. Also, if you forget sunscreen and need more than the small sample provided in your room, there's a dispenser by the pool -- that definitely came in handy. Oh, did I mention the unbeatable location? Before we arrived, we were apprehensive about it being on the edge of Waikiki Beach and a block from the ocean, behind another hotel, but it ended up being awesome. For significantly less than a cramped city view room in Waikiki's 4- and 5-star beachfront hotels, we got a well-appointed, spacious room with sweeping ocean views and impeccable service. The money we saved allowed us to do so much more on this very expensive island -- with Queen Kapiolani, you can truly ""have it all"", even if you're on a budget. P.S. Do yourself a favor and check out Queen Kapiolani's website (""Packages"" page) for the best deals. We booked with the ""summer special"" which is 15% off the best rate and no hospitality fee (if you've looked at hotels in Honolulu, then you'll know that's a steal.) There were other offers for ""4th night free"" and ""prepay and save"", so definitely compare your savings on all available options before checking out to make the most of your money!","Glendale, California","katelynra</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glendale, California</strong>",8,5.0

It's a couple of blocks back from Waikiki beach, which cuts back on some of the noise but the local is still highly convenient. Being next to the park/zoo, you have great views towards Diamond Head and also don't feel crowded in among Waikiki's other high-rises. The ground-floor coffee shop also sells beer/wine/basic cocktails if you fancy a quiet drink when the third floor bar is a bit too hoppin'.

Previous visits to Waikiki, we have stayed at 5 star hotels but because I was on a budget this time, QK fit the bill fabulously.The decor throughout the hotel - to the key cards to our rooms are beautiful- absolutely stunning. Our studio room was surprisingly spacious - some people have reviewed it saying it’s tiny, I disagree. It’s enough space for one or two people. The room is light and airy, we freaking loved it.Mum was pleased that they had a built in seat in the shower and made it easy for her to use as in other hotels we stayed in, it was always so difficult to use.The cleanliness of the rooms were of high standard.

Overall, we were pleased with the accommodations. There are many pluses to staying at this hotel and some negatives. First of all, it's right next to the Honolulu Zoo (literally across the street), 10 minute walk to the Aquarium, 8 minute Uber Drive to the Diamond Head Hiking Trail, and a 5 minute walk to the Waikiki Beach. The Hotel itself has a nice cafe, an average eatery on the 2nd or 3rd floor. There is an ice maker on floors 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 which is a first world inconvenience. The hotel appears to have been recently renovated. The balcony with the partial Ocean view was well...partial. The hotel has wifi and the staff were overall very helpful. I wasn't entirely satisfied with the Concierge. From my experience, the Concierge services at hotels is a hit and miss depending on the individual helping you. Waikiki has a million places to eat. We went to Marukami, the Udon place, Eggs N' Things for breakfast/brunch, which was a 45 minute wait. For Eggs N' Things, it's a small place. Pancakes are great, but that's about it. If you want an inexpensive tour, take the Blue Line. It picks you up right in front of Duke's famous statue at Waikiki Beach. Explore the various lines (Blue, Yellow, eta al.) to get around if you are cost-conscious. Otherwise, there are plenty of tours. We took a tour that included the Dove Plantation, mini-Coffee Plantation, Kayaking, and the hike to a water fall. The main highlights are the Kayaking and the hike. The Dove and Coffee Plantations were super rushed.

Trapped food odors were a frequent problem.*Lack of storage for clothing. The only storage for folded clothing was an open shelving unit, so all of your underclothing was on full display.*Tiny lanai.*No ventilation or fans in the bathrooms.There is, however, a transom window. *Located at the far end of the strip away from most of the dining/shopping venues.*The Deck restaurant was hit or miss with food quality and overpriced.

Richard, on of the valet parking attendants, heard us on the phone and said he would personally handle it because he knew the courier that did the bags. Within 30 minutes we had the right bag delivered. On Day 5 of our vacation, my daughter, wife and I had our bags stolen off the beach. In my bag was my GoPro with my bucket list shark cage dive video, wallet with my money, credit cards, and I.D. my daughters bag with her expensive camera which had photo's of my other daughter engagement and vacation photos, iPhone, etc. The suspects also got the key to my rental Jeep and stole that as well. About 45 minutes later, the police found my rental crashed and the suspect gone. You can't make this up. LOLNoli at the hotel sent us out a cab. When we got back to the hotel we were devestated. My wife and daughter were crying and heartbroken. Ken saw this and dropped our valet and resort charges to help us out. Jocelyn who was a sweetheart, gave us hugs and treated us like a family member.

The cleaning staff was very friendly - Mata made sure to say hello every time we saw her in the hall! She was truly a joy and did a great job of making sure we were comfortable.

The location, view of diamond head, ocean, pool below, listening to music from the bar area on the lanai several nights was wonderful. We found the room small to all the others we had stayed in, but manageable. We did not care for the shelves they had as there are no dressers. We kept most everything in our suitcase because of that.The air conditioner blew cold air straight out at the bed closest to the window in this two queen bed room. Until the evening cooled outside and the air went off, you had to cover your head to stay warm. We kept the room at 74 degrees but it felt a lot colder. Also, if the air conditioner was on, you couldn't sit at the banquette by the window - even with a sweater on - just too cold. Ice and water on the floor was great, as was the elevator - we never had to wait. We liked the security feature of it too.The staff at the front desk were just okay. Often not even a smile and this was at the start of our stay. Directions given to popular sites was wrong twice, so we just googled the info. instead.We did have issues during our 7 nights here. We never could dial out locally from the phone in our room. I always had to get the hotel operator to do it for me. On the fourth day a gentleman at the front desk finally offered to have someone come in a fix it. On the seventh day it still wasn't working.We noticed our room was not really being cleaned and took note one morning that two men were doing the cleaning. We complained about numerous things not done and the next day a lady came in to clean and did a great job. She was off for a couple of days and again the men cleaned and it was poorly done. I had some VIM wipes and did the bathroom myself.We never went to the third floor to eat or swim. The food choice was too gourmet for our tastes.So overall we would not stay again. Poor service/cleaning, small room, and the air conditioning being the main reasons. Good location for town buses and being right next to Denny's where you can get a reasonably priced breakfast is a bonus.","Haliburton, Canada","wolvesmgr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haliburton, Canada</strong>",68,3.0

The food and drinks in the hotel restaurant was great, but unfortunately the service in the restaurant and pool area was quite poor. Which tarnished an otherwise perfect holiday. We would love to come back here, and I dare say we will. Im just hoping management will train their staff better. They were nice enough but had no idea what was going on most of the time.

Balcony was only large enough to sit and enjoy a coffee, except no coffee was provided.The maid storage door was right behind our headboard so every morning around 7am we would wake up to the door constantly opening and shutting. The bathroom felt outdated and of very low quality, and the toilet felt like it was at the height for a child.The airconditioning was on a movement censor so at night we would wake up sweating because the airconditioning had turned off. The hotel was hard to find as the outside signage is almost non-existent and there are no signs directing where to go for valet. After we found it by circling the block twice, it was fine, but this should be made easier for guests arriving by car. Had the staff not been so friendly (especially valet) and the internet worked so well I would have given this hotel 1* because my husband and I did not have one restful sleep the entire 9 nights we stayed.

We got 1811 and 1711 (the two floors below the penthouse floor). Views were amazing of Diamond Head and the ocean. We originally had booked just Diamond Head views but you won’t see the ocean as they are lower floors or at back of hotel (even though website photos show ocean...) The decor is very retro and relaxed. The pool area is small but had a great vibe and wonderful view of Diamond Head. Only fault would be that you see the power lines next to pool but that can’t be helped. Staff all very friendly. Ice machines on every second floor run out of ice early in afternoon (on have a small capacity) but we were able to get more ice from bar near pool.

The stay was nice but there were a few things that made our stay a little uncomfortable. First thing was the water temperature in the shower. I could never get to the right temperature. I was only getting really hot water or really cold water. I know I'm in Hawaii and is warm but I didn't want a cold shower everytime I jump in. I tried turning the dial of both temperature at the same time but it never got to the medium temperature.The Mattress: The mattress itself was too hard for my body, especially after a long day of hiking or swimming. The mattress was so hard that it didn't contour to my body. I spoke to someone at the front desk about it but he said it was selected to cater to the Japanese tourists. The noise bothered us the most since the room was the first next to the elevators, about 8-10 ft away. We can hear the beep each time the elevator stopped on our floor, we heard each time someone closes their doors in our corridor and people talking while walking pass the room. We noticed a gap at the bottom of the door that it can clearly be seen which I'm assuming how the noise gets through.Although we had these issues, we never asked for a different room because we liked the view very much, but view isn't what we rest our bodies on at night while recovering from our daytime activities.",,chongyfresh,0,2.0

The view from the bed of Diamond Head was amazing. The hotel is clean, staff are friendly and most tours leave from hotels very close by (within a five minute walk). Beautifully renovated hotel with lots of potential. Expedia representatives on-site to assist with booking tours. Complimentary water bottles provided for all excursions. Denny's just one block from hotel.ConsOnly things to watch out for are no tea or coffee maker in the room. If you want to have a coffee or tea in the early morning or late at night, there is no option in the hotel. The bathroom is a bit on the small side, especially with regards to finding a space to put shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Overall ExperienceExcellent service however, I did request if they could do anything special (even just a Hope you have a Happy Birthday during the stay) for my husband's birthday via email and however nothing was done. I had to ask then was told that they could not do anything.

I think the one thing that sticks out to me that the staff was very attentive during our 2 night stay. Our room was a city view that was clean, well maintained and really enjoyed during this last leg of our trip. Staff was really helpful in recommending places to go and food to eat. We really enjoyed the pool and the views by the restaurant of diamond head state park. The water was a little difficult to control in the shower but we figured out how to balance the hot and cold water as there was a small delay when the hot water would engage. There is one hostel that tends to get a little rowdy on the city side but if you can drown it out with the fan, you'll be okay. The beds were comfortable, but would say that the pillows were too puffy. We did find that the red pillows on the couch were great if you don't like sleeping with your chin on your chest. The hotel still gets a 5/5 as there were not any undermining qualities. It is worthy to note it is within walking distance to Waikiki beach, Starbucks, and the zoo. Beach towels are by the valet.

I have loved this hotel for many years. I have seen this hotel go through many renovations, and I am pleased to see it to continually improve. This is my second visit since the latest round of renovations. The latest renovation has provided a casual, laid-back style with a touch of elegance and quiet nod to the past. The gallery of historical paintings pays respect to the glorious past of Hawaii. The lobby area shops provides a number of relaxing options from pineapple whips to coffees, bites to eat, art, etc. The lobby itself is spacious with a true beachy feel; murals, decor, furnishings, island music, very laid back, and just begging you to come sit for awhile to enjoy that Aloha whip. The location is next to none! It is convenient to the beach, the bus line, restaurants, east Waikiki activities, the Honolulu zoo and Aquarium. It is an easy walk to the busier, noisier end of Waikiki. The beds are comfy, the linens nice, the towels thick. Housekeeping is very good - special shout outs to Dustin and Teo who miraculously arranged to have my room cleaned daily around my very early morning schedule. Reception is always nice and friendly, attentive to any needs, easy check in and check out. Jocelyn has gone out of her way to help make my stays incredible. Kawai always provides a smile and such a positive attitude; seeing him in the morning just starts your day out with a smile. Seeing the same staff members from trip to trip is one of the reasons I return to the Queen Kapiolani. As with any hotel, especially Hawaii, you get what you pay for. Consider splurging for a room with a Diamond Head or ocean view. This hotel offers some of the greatest views; take advantage of it!Aloha.

The spacious open air lobby was quite comfortable with ample space to relax and take in the various small businesses stationed on the hotel's first floor (coffee, frozen treats, artsy gifts). We were quickly checked in and took one of the elevators to our room. During our stay, one of the elevators was out of service meaning we sometimes had to wait a bit longer to get up and down, but the views of Diamondhead and the Ocean from our 12th floor room were fantastic. We also really enjoyed the spacious lanai, choosing to pick up some provisions and enjoy breakfasts listening to the sounds of the animals walking up in Honolulu Zoo (directly across the street).Beyond the superbly clean room, friendly staff, and efficient check-in process, it was the little things that made our stay incredible enjoyable. The highly walkable block-and-a-half to get to two different beaches, the water bottles in the room, the filtered water available in the lobby and on our floor, an aggressively pleasant deck with ample opportunity for both sun and shade, and a nice little pool to cool off in.The other great thing is access to the Waikiki shopping without being in the midst of all the people. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance, and several accessible bike share racks make it easy to take a bike ride around Diamondhead or to basically anywhere you need.Only dinging 1 star for the non-functioning elevator, as the waits and number of people needing to get up and down could sometimes get a bit long.",,billsredbeard,3,4.0

We loved the water/ice stations for refilling our water bottles. The location was great - convenient to Waikiki shopping and beaches, but a little away from the madness. It was fun to sit on the patio at Knots and hear the monkeys and other animals at the zoo. We would definitely stay again on a return visit. Also, we had a room right next to an elevator, but brought along a travel white noise machine, which worked perfectly to drown out any noise from the elevator, hall, or adjoining rooms.","Birmingham, Michigan","Z6486ICmelissad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Michigan</strong>",4,5.0

We absolutely loved the pool area with amazing Diamond Head views, the restaurant/bar area was awesome with great food. The hotel is very cute with lots of fun art and a vintage hawaii feel. The Green room gallery is awesome and the coffee shop is good. The things we felt were lacking was the service in all aspects of the hotel. The highlight was the check-in agent was nice and was able to get us a room earlier than our check-in time which we really appreciated. After that the service went flat. The servers at the restaurant and pool were very slow, but friendly. I suspect they were understaffed. They have a water machine in the lobby but no cups and when we were on our way out of the hotel and very thirsty we asked for a cup and they did not have any just told us we have water bottles in our room, which is great but not when you are on your way out to a fancy wedding, I am not going to haul my water bottle around with me. It would be great if they also had cups at least behind the desk for such situations. I am all about being eco-friendly which this hotel is working really hard at, but there is also the service and comfort you would expect in a nice hotel that needs to be maintained. They had a bartender working the coffee shop in the evening who proclaimed he never works there and doesn't know what he is doing and he was right about that. He had to make my double espresso three times, once because he threw it away as I was paying! The rooms were cute and clean but quite small, it was very crowded with the 4 of us. We were in 407 and it was very noisy at 5:30 AM with the dumpster being emptied each morning, the rooms are not soundproofed and it sounded like the truck was in our room I would for sure stay here again but upgrade our room to a larger one, away from the alley.

The room was a real treat and the view of the ocean, Diamond Head and Kapiolani Park were spectacular. We have always preferred the location of this hotel as its at the end of Waikiki and off the main strip allowing the guest to choose between quieter times or walking down the street to the more commercial area of Waikiki.A couple of things for the hotel to work on for our next visit.....1. a full length mirror in this particular room layout is definitely needed and could easily be installed adjacent the clothes hanging area. 2.Coffee and tea making facilities should be standard in these rooms. 3.Considering the Hospitality fee, the hotel would do well to invest in more Beach chairs, which are advertised on the Hotel website, but are few and far between and in poor repair. We were advised that guests do not always return the chairs daily as requested, but this could be improved by actually keeping log of who takes what and when, and if that fails, to charge a daily refundable deposit.Overall a great stay at this hotel and we will definitely choose Queen Kapiolani Hotel again when visiting Oahu.

I was traveling with my husband and in order for the second person to get in/out of bed, you would have to jump over the person. You only have enough space to walk to the bathroom. They called this a standard room. I kid you not, it was probably on 95 square feet total.I had to pay for an upgrade if I wanted another room. I was shown one that was bigger and had a sofabed and king bed. It had a patio with 2 feet x 5 feet in size. The space was good but all the windows/drapes would need to be closed because the building next to it was so close and it gave me a freaky feeling. I refused the upgrade.The gal that was assisting me offered one with a better view but the upgrade cost would not be worth it since I live in Hawaii.So I inform the gal that all I want is a bed that I can get in from either side and space to walk comfortably through without getting brosed just to get to the bathroom .We finally got a room (Jr Suit) after 30 minutes and paid for the upgrade because I refuse to stay in a closet room.","Maui, Hawaii","Fely G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maui, Hawaii</strong>",1,4.0

The room was ok, I had the “hostel” view, right across is a hostel and my window/lanai faced its rooftop deck area, so that meant I had to put the blackout blinds on or everyone could see what I was up to at night. The windows aren’t very insulated so I could hear birds chirping in the morning and also the college age kids playing drinking games during the evening on the hostel deck. The tub drain was dirty already and looked like it had been used well before any renovation, and there was even a crack on the side of the tube. I reported it to front desk so that I wouldn’t get in trouble, they only notated it and said they didn’t need to call engineering, which was fine because I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t going to be responsible at check out. The lanai door was an old door rather than a sliding glass door, so that was weird. I’m sure the higher floors are better, but being on the edge by the zoo just didn't help the experience I had.

Overall, we had a very pleasant stay. Every person who works there from the front desk, to the bell desk and maid service are very friendly. The location is awesome. We've been to Waikiki at least 10x and each time we stay at a different hotel. We've stayed at the high end brands like the trump, Sheraton Moana, and some other boutique hotels like the Hotel Renew.. The Queen Kapiolani (with the renovation) is a very nostalgic/sleek hotel. I love all the old posters on the walls and the simple design layout. It's next to the zoo, away from the main strip which makes it convenient to get in and out of Waikiki without hitting tourist traffic. We opted out of the expensive $30 valet rate and easily found parking nearby everyday. It's an easy 15-20 min walk to the DFS shopping center (which is on the other end of the strip where all the high end stores are located). TIP: If you are sensitive to noise, request a higher floor room. Ours was on the 18th floor, 1 floor beneath the penthouse floor. Although our room was high up, I could still hear some street noise from below especially on Friday/Saturday nights, the music from the deck was very loud. The hotel is located next to a lot of Hostels so expect random drunken noises from the younger kids. So here are my pros and cons:PROS-1) The little stretch of beach by the hotel is great because it's not crowded and there's a barrier that blocks the waves.2) Free reef safe sunscreen. We decided to buy sunscreen at the ABC store because the hotel sunscreen smelled a bit funny and it was too thick to put on3) Free beach chairs, towels and boogie boards (great for beach days)4) Free pineapple whip samples at the lobby5) Love Whiskey Wednesdays by the pool & HH at the coffee bar in the lobby. Strong $8 Old Fashioned and $6 mai tais in the lobby6) Free water bottles for water refills7) Prompt service: clean rooms everyday. Our window shades were broken and was fixed right awayCONS-1) Driving in on the first day from Kapahulu, there's no visible signs showing the entrance to the hotel. Turn right on Lemon, and another right up the ramp is where the valet & pickup/drop off is located. And the lobby is on the right2) Next to hostels so noise is to be expected3) Deck: cool diamond head view and happy hours but the food service is a bit slow. A group of us went down for drinks one night and sat there for 1 hour without getting any service from the staff. We left empty handed. 4) Rooms and bathroom on the smaller size.

I'm not sure how *special* that level is, other than we had a corner room with a deck overlooking two directions - some of the hotel district to the side and the ocean. The room itself was small and the layout quirky. It was equipped with a TV, but that was placed on a narrow shelf, and was only visible at a severe angle from the bed, even turned as much as possible. There was not a single chair in the room; only a small built in seating area smaller than a loveseat. We thought the hotel's location was great. It's a *very* easy walk to a beach or to a pier with great Waikiki or sunset views. And it's an easy walk down Kalakaua Avenue - we strolled all the way to the Halekulani.The Deck restaurant gets mixed reviews. The outdoor venue is very pleasant for dining. Breakfast was very good - the coconut chia “pudding” outstanding. Dinner was OK. But a ""margherita"" pizza is *not* a cheese pizza with red sauce and basil. We also ordered two apps, which turned out to be entree sized. Great bargains, but not if you've also ordered entrees that you then can't finish.Overall, I'll give the hotel a solid 4 stars. Not at the level of the ""fancier"" hotels, but very comfortable and nicely situated.","Old Lyme, Connecticut","GregF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Old Lyme, Connecticut</strong>",48,4.0

You can’t beat the view at this price point. Location was on the quieter end of Waikiki, across from the zoo and within walking distance of several restaurants and only 1 block from the beach. The renovated lobby and 3rd floor restaurant, lounge and pool area are gorgeous and look brand new (but the pool is very small). I was surprised that after the expensive renovation, the guest rooms have just received a fresh coat of paint and some new hipster/vintage décor. Walls are still thin with old popcorn ceilings, “bath-fitter” shower stall and no bathroom ventilation fan, and the wall-mounted A/C unit means that the temperature can be uneven throughout the room. Bath towels were thin and sandpaper rough. Windows were spotty and needed to be cleaned. Street noise may bother light sleepers, even on higher floors. Front desk service was inconsistent - we received fantastic service from some employees (Justin Bliss and David Kim) but our initial interactions with front desk staff left us confused and frustrated. The hotel seems to have a strict 3pm check-in time (even if your room is ready), so after a long day of travelling, we sat exhausted in the lobby with all our luggage for over an hour until 3pm. Before our stay, we had called the front desk to make sure that we got the room and view we reserved, but were still given the wrong room at check-in. After we were switched to the correct room type, we were finally able to relax and enjoy ourselves. We especially appreciated the fact that when we left the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door, no one bothered us at all. Overall, my partner and I had a wonderful relaxing stay at the Queen Kapiolani, mainly due to the amazing views from our room and balcony. We just wanted to be honest about all the minor issues so anyone reading this can manage their expectations when booking a room here.","Vancouver, Canada","Phyll_YVR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",21,4.0

REALLY. I have my favorite hotels, but budget excluded those choices. I really needed a long 8 night trip to get some much needed sun and rest in my old hometown. I’m so glad I did because the hotel lobby was nostalgic and airy and comfortable, this is important to come “home” to after a long day in and out multiple times. The hotel manager was kind enough to upgrade me after the first room wasn’t good enough for my level of pickiness, you can imagine how relieved I was. My room was CLEAN, comfy, and cozy. Pristine walls and carpet. The city view from the 9th floor is lovely with all the city lights at night. The negatives is that it’s not in a central location with the fancier shops but I didn’t mind that for this rest and relaxation birthday trip. The area surrounding the hotel is a little run down, and there is a hostel next door with a rooftop tabled gathering area that can get very loud, but you just close the door/window and you can’t hear them to much. Queens beach is right across Kalākaua ave and it’s got surprisingly good clear snorkeling with plenty of fish. It’s mostly coral, with some sandy patches to wade around in. There’s a Starbucks just a few doors down from the hotel which was a dream come true for me. Two ABC stores somewhat adjacent to the Starbucks, so having that convenience was great since we didn’t want a car rental. There’s a great video on YouTube of the area, search for “Honolulu Zoo to Waikiki Beach 2/16/2019” .",Domesticj,"Juniperrr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Domesticj</strong>",10,5.0

We loved the location since it was in the less busy area of Waikiki. It's directly across from the zoo which = unobstructed views of diamond head. Absolutely stunning views from the rooms. The rooms itself are pretty small and basic. I suggest you bring closet organizers if you plan on being in Hawaii for a while because the open closet only has a few hangers and there is no iron or ironing board in the room. The room and bathroom are really small. But all rooms include a refrigerator and the suites have a microwave and kitchenette. The rooms also included 2 water bottles which came in handy. But the ice/water dispenser is only located on select floors. Most times the ice machine would run out of ice so we would have to search throughout the hotel on multiple floors to find some. If you can select a room on a floor with an ice/ water dispenser to save yourself the trouble. We did order food at the onsite restaurant. It was OK, but very pricey. The wi-fi constantly went out throughout the day. I had issues with our room and bathroom faucet and management was great about tending to the issues.

It was the most relaxing, energising holiday I have had. I am already planning my next visit there in a couple of months. I selfishly hope the hotel remains a bit of a ‘secret’ for a little while longer. The hotel anticipated everything I needed and even those I had not thought of! All was smooth and easy All staff were wonderful from Noli who checked me in to the always smiling Anthony at the Deck who would make my day.

My daughter and I stayed here at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel last November (10-17) soon after their $35 million renovation. Due to their renovation they reopened with rooms half price which was a great. The hotel is located around the corner from the bottom of Kalakaua Avenue, well the main drag through Waikiki, and is a 5 minute walk if that up from Queens Beach, the Waikiki Beach Walls and Kūhiō Beach up Kapahulu Avenue past Starbucks on the corner, Teddy's Bigger Burgers and Hula’s Bar and Lei Stand which are both in the Waikiki Grand Hotel next door. The Honolulu Zoo and Queen Kapiolani Park is directly across the road and they recently opened a Denny's about a block up from the Queen Kapiolani Hotel on the right hand side just before Kūhiō Avenue on the left. Our VIP Trans transfer van dropped us off at the back of the hotel and we were greeted by their friendly valet staff. The reception area and lobby are just stunning, very tastefully done and retro cool. A friendly young man Noli at reception was very helpful and although we arrived at the hotel at around 8am and our room wasn't going to be ready until 3pm we were happy to hang out in the lobby (but ended up having breakfast at Denny's then shopping at Ala Moana Center to kill time). The lobby has a lot to offer, the Knots Coffee Roasters cafe serves excellent coffee and some nice breakfast options with a lovely open seating area at the front of the hotel. There is also an ice cream, iced drinks and the much loved Dole whip soft serve. There is also an art store, a surf store where you can book surf lessons, bathrooms for guests, a Flowater purified water station to fill up your water bottle(s), an ATM, a helpful concierge desk and lots of comfortable seating including these benches which have both USB ports and power outlets underneath. The pool deck is on the third floor is awesome with unobstructed views of Diamond Head, complimentary beach towels, beach chairs and even a sunscreen dispenser by the pool. Note the pool isn't heated which didn't faze us but a lot of people were surprised and found the pool very cold, meh. There's also the hotel restaurant, Deck, on the third floor which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. We had the acai bowls there for breakfast one morning and they were huge. We managed to get into our room on the 16th floor at 2pm and our room was amazing, very clean and very classy. The two queen beds were very comfortable and although the lanai (balcony) in our city view room was small you have nice views of Waikiki, mainly the surrounding hotels but you could still catch the sunrise and sunset to your left and see the mountains in the distance from the right. The bathroom is small but there are some nice Hawaiian Tropics products, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion, with a good sized bath/shower with great water pressure and plenty of towels. The city view room also has a 49"" LCD LG televisions with premium channels and Staycast. Staycast seemed like a cool idea, like Google Cast but secure to your room only you are able to cast YouTube, Netflix etc from your iPhone, iPad, mobile device but it kept dropping out which was very frustrating. There is plenty of room for your bags, a room safe big enough for a notebook (laptop) and a closet area with shelves for your clothing etc. My only negative points on this room/hotel is that on our first night and a few times afterwards the wifi dropped out sometimes for a few hours which doesn't help when you are trying to video chat with family back home and/or chat, and for some odd reason I noticed that there are two light switches near the room door, one is for some lights but the other is for this lamp on the mini fridge which is plugged into the same power point as the lamp so when you switch this lamp off at the wall you actually turn off the fridge. I realised this when our mini fridge started to smell a bit iffy and our corn chip dip inside the mini fridge was warm. But all in all my daughter and I had a wonderful one week stay at the Queen Kapiolani Hotel, again the staff are very friendly and helpful. I would like to give a shout out to Noli at the reception desk as well as Richard and Kawai at the valet desk.

We had a mini frig, water bottles, microwave and even some dishes in the room. I was able to make a tea in the morning and keep my snacks/breakfast in frig.

We got the travelzoo grand opening deal and had the premier ocean view room on the 12/F. What we like:- view of the room - lovely ocean view and unobstructed diamond Head view- valet guys - they are super friendly and happy and helpful!- the shops/cafes- hotel is close to the quieter part of the beach with some nice shade from the palm trees. Hotel has beach chairs and towels for you to grab as well.What we didn't like:1. Room's bathroom. - The shower curtain smells really bad.- There is no venting fans but a window. However, ants were coming in from there even when window is closed.- We think it makes more sense to replace the shower curtain with glass door. Less laundry and we could have a view of the ocean in the shower too.2. Room itself- pillows are small- even though our room had great views, the windows are very dirty- we had a balcony but the AC unit is also there making it unpleasant to sit on the balcony3. Hotel's overdoing the eco-friendly theme- our bath amenities are 3/4 done and they didn't give us new ones and we had to call and ask for them - water and ice stations are on even floors only. During our stay, the ones on our floor, 10/f, 8/f and 14/f weren't working either.- the sun screen at the pool stick to your skin so well that we couldn't get it off. Ended up had to get some scrubbing cloth from ABC.4. Check in- Check in was ""efficient"". There was no greeting or whatsoever. We handed over our ID and credit card, then a few minutes of silence later, we get our keys and were directed to leave.- The deal we got included two free coffees at the knots, it wasn't offered and when I was about to ask the lady who checked us in, she left her station already. We never got that coffee.Overall - average budget friendly hotel at the tail end of Waikiki. It is much cheaper than all other hotels, it's renovated and it's still considered in Waikiki area. But we personally won't stay here again since we would rather pay more to be somewhere closer to Central Waikiki and in a hotel that is a bit nicer.PS. has a small pool (no pool service, you gotta go to the bar at the restaurant to order) ","Los Angeles, California","monkeykidkong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",24,3.0

Coming to Waikiki, in my price range I had the choice of a uhigh end hotel right on the ocean with a fair(not exceptional) view of the ocean or the Queen Kapiolani which is a short walk from the ocean, in a fair neighborhood but which has been beautifully renovated, which has a youthful feeling and has drop dead views both of Diamond Head and the Ocean. For a reasonable fee, I got an upgraded “junior suite” (Not really a suite)with panoramic views of Diamond Head and the ocean on the 17 th floor. Upon entering the room My wife and I were just amazed at the incredible vistas. For a view monger like myself, I knew I had made the right choice of hotels.The Bed is comfortable, room is clean, the artwork in the hotel is fun, while the exercise room is pretty first class for a mid range hotel. The pool has a shaded area if you don’t want too much sun (yay!)and the people who work here seem friendly and helpful. So much of the hotel has been upgraded and they did a good job in the renovation. So a very good hotel for the price as long as you’re not looking for a five star hotel ie the chairs in the room are very simple and not exceptionally comfortable, bathroom is small (but the shower has great water pressure), the place to store your clothes is just a bunch of cubby holes (which actually works quite well) and when it was time to check in, there was a bit of a wait but not horrible, you’re not on the water etc.",Upstate New York,"UpstateNewYork1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Upstate New York</strong>",27,5.0

This hotel was one we found through searching the area on TripAdvisor. We booked 6 nights in a suite. The location is excellent - close enough to Waikiki centre and far enough to have some privacy from the constant noise, construction, etc in Waikiki. Aside from location, the hotel left a lot to be desired. For quite an expensive room (only one category of room higher above what we had picked), the room is quite unremarkable. Clean and tidy which is nice, but resembles a standard priced overnight-stay type of hotel you would find in any major city for much cheaper and probably better amenities. Small shower with old shower curtain, old bath, water from shower flows onto toilet beside. Our issue is with the service at this hotel which is a real issue. We experienced great, personable service everywhere we went except the hotel. To echo what people have said, we certainly were not looked after despite the cost of the room. - we arrived 6hrs early before check in time from an international flight. We had specifically contacted the hotel in advance to advise of this and request an early check-in. Not only could we not check-in this early (which logistically, we understand does happen), the staff provided literally no direction. The entire conversation was “no you cannot check-in now”. We did not get use of wi-fi, pool, shower or any amenities. We explained our situation re the long flight etc, and were met with again, “no you cannot check-in now”. Check in was not available until exactly 3pm despite numerous attempts to confirm if the room was available. Valet staff were very helpful and friendly during this time, and tried to be quite understanding. - on check-out we asked the night prior how to get to the airport at 0530. They promised a flat fee of $29 for a taxi which would be arranged. On leaving the next morning we paid a $48 one-way trip in a taxi who refused what the hotel had claimed was an arrangement. This was the entirety of our remaining cash in our wallet and was lucky we had enough.Overall - this hotel is in a good location and the room is clean. Views are nice. It is not a cheap option by any means and provided very little service at all from staff.

A visit to the website was alluring, with it's mid century decor, cool beach theme and a recent 34 million dollar renovation of the 1960's hotel. Set at the end of Waikiki beach, overlooking the majestic Diamond Head and within walking distance to the beach it ticked every box. I had my fingers crossed that it would not disappoint.And disappoint it did not. Exceed expectations... it did! From the moment we arrived we were drawn into the chilled vibe of the Queen Kapiolani with it's brilliant service, open, breezy entrance and vibrant communal spaces. It was evident that this hotel had been recently refreshed but the designers had honoured the spirit of the hotel and the bones and integrity were intact. The facelift included vintage inspired artwork, bold colours, clever use of space, surfboard adornments and tributes to ""The Duke"". We immediately fell in love with the place!Our room was also in the same vein; vintage, simple but fresh and adequate for our stay and affordable at the busiest and most expensive time of the year. Over the course of eight days we came to realise that the location is ideal, as it was easy to leave in the hire car, re enter Waikiki in this area - in short a perfect locality to launch yourself from to explore Oahu. However, when the more commercialised areas of Waikiki called us, the designer shops and restaurants were a short stroll down the esplanade. However, on those nights when you just could not be bothered walking anywhere, after a long day at the beach, the hotel also provided a fabulous restaurant of it's own, with cuisine of the highest standard and wines sourced from the globe to compliment the food and experience. On alternate nights when a drink and snack was required before hitting the pavement, ""The Deck"" delivered music, drinks, snacks with the best of backdrops...Diamond Head at Sunset. What's not to love?I can thoroughly recommend the Queen Kapiolani to those wanting an intimate Waikiki experience that is reminiscent of Waikiki before the monolithic high rise dominated the skyline. It has a variety of rooms with stunning vistas and beautifully styled rooms which include city views, beach views and views of Diamond Head. All wonderful but reality is that Waikiki and Oahu is such a great holiday destination for all that you wont be spending much time in your hotel room! We plan to revisit Waikiki with a sense of immediacy and will return to ""The Queen Kapiolani"" to enjoy the service, hotel and the experience.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay -- the staff was all very friendly and helpful, the restaurant and pool deck were awesome, and the little perks everywhere were really appreciated. For instance: complimentary beach chairs, towels, boogie boards, and sunscreen; water refill stations everywhere, beautiful 24/7 gym with complimentary earbuds; and free on-property wi-fi.We had a double queen room and the 4 of us were comfortable if a little tight. Not a huge amount of closet space, but the open shelves were handy. Very good toiletries and comfy pillows. We had a fridge but no in-room coffee. Our A/C worked really well -- not a minor thing in Hawaii any time of year. We never ran out of hot water and the water pressure was really good.

They tried to add an undisclosed $60 resort fee to my confirmed room reservation (see photos). 4. Manager Kimberly Gomes was dismissive and unhelpful. 5. Kimberly tried to tell me she was doing me a favor by not charging me an additional $60 for my confirmed reservation. What happened:1. The Queen Kapiolani Hotel was listed on Hotels Tonight all week long at $102/night. 2. This morning at 7:30am I checked Hotels Tonight and the hotel was not listed. 3. I checked a different site, Hotels.com and the room was $185.20/night. Despite the increase I thought it would be a nice hotel so I booked it.4. I arrived at 10am and asked for an early check in but they said it would not be possible. 5. I checked Hotels Tonight again and to my suprise the room was listed again at $102- that price is $165 less than what I had just paid 2.5 hours ago!6. I called Hotels.com and they said to contact the Queen Kapiolani directly.7. After much back and forth with the front desk they finally brought manager Kimberly Gomes out.8. She tried to tell me the room charges should be $429.04 instead of $370.40 despite multiple emails, invoices, and receipts from Hotels.com saying the ""Total to be charged by the hotel"" is $370.40.9. Kimberly's ""solution"" was to honor the $370.40 price instead of charging me an extra $60 upon arrival. So, I paid $165 extra for my room because I booked my room 2.5 hours earlier than I should have and then upon arrival was told I've have to pay an ADDITIONAL $60. *Good customer service would have been to honor the lower price. *Acceptable customer service would have been giving me a nominal gift certificate or something to make up for the extra $165 they charged me.*Terrible customer service is trying to sneak in an undisclosed $60 resort fee and then telling me you're doing me a favor by waiving it.","Honolulu, Hawaii","NiDaiv</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",4,1.0

In short, diamond head view is unobstructed and absolutely beautiful so I highly recommend it for safe. if you want the ocean view, make sure it higher level ( 11th or above)I still gave it 5 stars thank you to all the hard working and friendly staffs.

I am simply writing to express my APPRECIATION for EXCELLENT guest service from the Queen Kapiolani Hotel staff.My husband and I were looking for a hotel for my father-in-law to spend a couple of days in because we want him to recuperate from a recent surgery in peace and quiet. Knowing that the Queen Kapiolani had just been newly renovated, we called and asked if we could come just to look at the rooms. Their answer? ABSOLUTELY.The Valet guys were super friendly and even kept our car near the entrance because they knew we weren't actually checking in! :o).Justin at the front desk was SO. VERY. HELPFUL. First, he allowed us up to the third floor so we could check out the restaurant and pool area, which is GORGEOUS. Then he took us up to view a variety of different rooms... a city view, a Diamond Head view, and a Junior Suite. The renovations are beyond beautiful... each room is spacious and comfy... and completely welcoming! Being able to see these rooms in person rather than just on the website was so much fun! ^.^Needless to say, we just completed booking my father-in-law's stay and I want to be him!!!

We were on the 15th floor in a city view room with 2 x queen beds - the beds were very comfy, ample wardrobe/storage space for our 8 night stay, partial view of the ocean from the balcony, bathroom was okay. The hotel lobby is nice, open-air and they have a cafe and store with the famous pineapple dole whip, slushies and nuts. All the staff, especially the bell boys were super friendly and helpful, booking transfers and tours for us, storing our bags and providing directions and recommendations.

It's a short easy walk up to the main drag with all the shops and restaurants but is nice to be in a quieter area away from the hustle bustle of it all. Only negative comments were that they hosted the Gay Pride Parade Finale Pool Party private function which meant guests couldn't use the hotel's pool for 5 hours on the weekend and that it was my birthday over my stay and the staff did not take notice and say anything or have a sign or something in my room to say happy birthday.Other than that I had a great stay, the rate was also a great price and I would definitely recommend and stay here again","Sydney, Australia","Nateliza</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

The room was spacious modern and designed very well. Based on the photos of what the hotel previously looked like they did an amazing job renovating. Our room had a private balcony which was awesome to just sit and appreciate the view. The hotel has a nice pool with plenty of seating attached to the Hotel’s restaurant called Deck. Didn’t eat at the restaurant but we grabbed a few drinks there 2 of the nights we stayed.During our stay housekeeping cleaned our room everyday so every time we came back from a long day out we came back to tidy room which was great. Front desk staff was very friendly as well. One of the biggest highlight of the hotel staff would 100% be the valet and baggage guys. They were our first and last interaction at the hotel and they definitely leave a great lasting impression. Every valet and baggage staff we encountered was super friendly,helpful, and approachable. I loved that we were able to talk them and it just felt very natural, like we were talking to our friends/family. We met a lot of the guys working the bell/valet so I can’t remember all their names except for Warren and Scot but they were all great!
