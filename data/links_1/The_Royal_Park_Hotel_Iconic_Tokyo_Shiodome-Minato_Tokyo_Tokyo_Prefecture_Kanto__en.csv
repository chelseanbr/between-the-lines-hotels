For a family of 3 travelling we stayed at the Deluxe King which offered a true king size bed and a sofa bed. There were plenty of closet space and drawer space for stuff as we were there for 5 nights. The bathroom is also very spacious so getting ready to go out in the morning was much more efficient. We could see the Tokyo Tower from our room and the city lights at night was an added bonus giving you a sense of the vibrant city. One of the major plus is its convenient location. There is a direct underpass to the Shimbashi metro hub and Shiodome station. This gives easy access to almost everywhere in Tokyo. It is also a short walk to Ginza. There are loads of restaurants within easy reach of a short walk. It was also super convenient to get to Narita airport. There is a train on Asakusa line (from Shimbashi station) directly to Narita airport. Check with concierge for the timetable. The ride is slightly over 1 hour and cost just 1000+yen. This was the perfect hotel and we loved their happy hour at lobby lounge. ,"Shanghai Region, China","XP-Traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai Region, China</strong>",91,5.0

There is also shopping and restaurants within steps of the hotel. It was clean, quiet and the beds were wonderful. We stayed 2 nights before our trip to Osaka and Kyoto.

The hotel itself is situated in a very handy location with the trains just below and a 5 mins walk away. There were also shopping centers filled with restaurants and a convenience store all near the hotel, again 5 or so mins walk away. We managed to see a lot of Tokyo so it was very handy to have the trains so close to the hotel.The room itself was ok sized, we opted for the moderate room. Definitely a great choice as the other rooms are a tad smaller then the one we had, it was spacious enough to hold two large suitcases. The bed was comfy and large enough for 2 people. The bathroom was ok, although needed revamping but was still clean. The toilet was separate to the bathroom, had to move from the bathroom to the toilet but didn't mind. The toilet was clean and Japanese design.The staff at the hotel were uber friendly. We only had one grumpy staff member upon checking in but for the rest of the time there everyone else was so friendly and helpful, when we needed help with directions or general questions.The only thing we struggled with the hotel is room service. At times when we've had a long day exploring and walking we just wanted the treat and luxury of room service. Although we had restaurants nearby, many, sometimes when it was cold we just wanted to stay in our rooms in the evening.Haneda airport is only 30mins train ride away, and only one line from the hotel, we used this both ways when using the hotel. It was very convenient and cost effective as the taxis are expensive and shuttles take a long time as they need to stop at different hotels.As most reviews have said, this hotel is a great location and very convenient with plentiful of restaurants nearby.",,B1507_UK,9,4.0

I stayed between December 27, 2019 to January 8th 2020. This opinion was mostly driven by it's location, which is located at a major metro hub, Shimbashi station. Shimbashi station, you can hop on any train and get anywhere in Tokyo. There were multiple local food places around outside the hotel, it was a very convenient location. I found the staff to be helpful and attentive, I had a package delivered to me that didn't have my name on it, but I was able to retrieve from the hotel front desk with no issues. The breakfast at the hotel was great, had a good selection to choose from. The hotel room, I went with a Moderate size room, the room I found was rather big for Japanese standards. Had plenty of room to maneuver my luggage and space to walk around. Housekeeping I found was good, especially in concerns with laundry. The decor for the room is slightly outdated and I feel should be updated. Even though I found the hotel to be great, I will probably not be staying there again for my next visit to Japan. Unfortunately, it seems my room had Bed Bugs, which has soured my opinion. Even worse, it seems I have brought a couple of hitchhikers back to my house as I keep waking up with bite marks. I have already spent about a $1000.00 in dealing with it, I am hopeful because of how early I started dealing with the problem, that I will not have to spend anymore and the pest is dealt with from the latest treatment.",,DrekkoOkami,1,2.0

The hotel is EXTREMELY centrally located and has easy access to almost all major train lines in the city (< 5-8 minute walk). The walk is completely covered, so in inclement weather, you are able to easily remain dry.You enter the hotel from the ground floor (obviously) and have to wait for one of (three or four) elevators to get to the lobby level. The elevators are relatively efficient but sometimes there can be small wait (a few minutes) and this got old to me pretty quickly.The ""lobby"" level of the hotel has a bar and a restaurant, with some absolutely amazing views. Check-in was relatively painless and efficient. Front desk/lobby were pleasant but not overly helpful. Surprisingly, I didn't really receive any offers to be assisted with my luggage which I found surprising for a hotel of this ""caliber"". Not a big deal, but it set the tone for the general service level of the hotel (which is fine). There are apparently a few different layouts of rooms in this hotel, and it's not clear from their website on which is which. They were actually able to show me a chart in the hotel which had the different floorplans of the rooms clarified.I had booked a ""moderate"" room which had a slight view of the city, but mostly looked at an adjacent office building (which seemed to have people in it 24/7, meaning you need to keep the shades drawn). I selected this room type because it was supposed to be slightly larger than some of the other rooms, but the way the room was laid out was a little disappointing. There was almost no usable storage space, there was a small, separate room for the toilet (no sink), and then another area with the sink + shower. The bathroom area had almost a motel-esque feel to it due to the layout. The room itself, despite being a decent size, felt cramped with unneeded furniture. There was a desk (stationary, I think) placed in front of the tv, along with a chair. There was very little room to navigate around either one and I found them both to be a nuisance and think the room would actually do better without them, space wise. I understand that a lot of/most rooms in Tokyo are on the smaller side, and while this room was larger than usual, the layout/configuration doesn't make use of the space very well.I would stay here again if I had to, but would also explore other options.","West Palm Beach, Florida","SKITZOZTIKS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Palm Beach, Florida</strong>",23,3.0

The basement level of the hotel provides access to the subway and to a Family Mart and connections to more restaurants. Outside the building is an English pub, a Starbucks, and a Tully’s. The staff were all welcoming. If you opt for the breakfast, you will get a ticket that enables you for a free breakfast at one of three eateries in the building. I only ate at Harmony for the western buffet breakfast and while it was crowded and hectic there each morning, I ate well. The room is furnished with satellite channels, but the only English channels were CNN and BBC so I kept the tv off and relied on the free and reliable WIFI for my Netflix programming. The room also has a kettle, fridge, safe, toiletries, and free bottled water. The location was excellent as public transportation is readily available here for trips within and outside of Tokyo. For my departure, I chose the Friendly Limousine Bus as I did not want to drag luggage through the subway during morning rush hour and the limousine bus was a great way to get to Narita.

When you arrive at the main drop off area, walk in and turn to your right and walk further in. You will see a wall but that is actually an automated door. Go to level 24 for check in. ii) The check in staff speak limited english but it ok. They got the job done.

Always have a beautiful smile and entertained my child when he took a map from them. iv)The bell captains were amazing. They knew i was heading out and it was going to rain so they offered me an umbrella. So pro-active. Thumbs up.v) Drinks at the bar were expensive but very convenient. There are many restaurants nearby, You can just walk a little and reach another building for dinner n drinks. For those with childen, do note that most of the restaurants outside allow smoking during dinner.vi) Breakfast at Harmony was ok. Some areas looked messy. The croissants were not great. Bread was good. Eggs were ok. There was an egg station.Love the mini Japanese selection at a corner. That was the best part. Coffee and tea was good.The staff were very busy and always rushing.One bad experience at Harmony restaurant was when we were asked to be seated in a room inside which was probably usually reserved for big groups. The restaurant was very full one morning and they told us to sit inside. One plump lady server was shocked to see us inside and raised her voice and asked who said we could just sit inside without asking. We told them to check with the manager who put us inside. She just stormed off angrily. Hmmm... definitely very surprised by her attitude, Japanese usually has the best service. Harmony has very nice views of Tokyo tower and Mt Fuji on good days.vii) Rooms were nice. Not big enough to open two cargo bags but it was spacious enough. You are charged more for adding kids in the room but they will not set extra beds. The shower amenities are good. The bathroom amenities are good too. But the counter is small. They provide toothbrushes, combs, bath salts, shavers, earbuds and headband. There was an ice bin and some glasses in our room. The ice dispenser was near the lift. The door of the rooms doesn't stay open and that was very troublesome for us to move in and out with the stroller. Housekeeping staff are very good there! Though sometimes they take longer to clean a room, they clean it quite well.viii)From the hotel's main lobby on the 24th floor, you can take the lift down straight to B2 where there is a Family Mart on the right. The area also leads you to Shimbashi station where you can connected a complex rail network.ix)From the hotel's first floor, you can walk towards the clock display and you will reach Shiodome station above ground. From there, you can take a train to Odaiba area where you can spend one whole day.We went in Sept when the weather was unbearably hot. We chose the worst possible day on out trip to visit Tsujiki market. Read somewhere that it is within walking distance but lo and behold.... on hot days, it makes the distance seem a lot longer. We melted into a pool of sweat when we arrived and resolved to cab back but we didn't haha. Took a train to Shibuya instead! Went to sweat it out with Hachiko instead. This trip brings back great memories when almost everyone in Tokyo asked us how we endured the worst ever typhoon in Tokyo in 20 years. The typhoon? It was bad enough to scare us for a long time. We were in the hotel room when the full effects of the typhoon struck Tokyo. The whole hotel was swaying and there were loud concrete sounds. The next day, there were many fallen trees along the pavements. DO not bother to use umbrellas as they will prove to be absolutely useless when the winds are strong. Some restaurants opposite the hotel shuttered.x) From the restaurants opposite , on the first floor, take the escalator down. walk further up and cross the road. Right behind that area is a whole hidden area of little eateries and bars that we didn't know until our last night! The next time I might still go back to Shinjuku area.

The hotel looked and for the most part offered 5 star services. I would probably consider it a 4.5 star hotel only because there were a couple of things that prevented it from being a 5 star hotel i.e. no room service and the food selection at the restaurants was not great. I was able to upgrade to the premium floor for a minimal cost which included breakfast for two and allowed me to to check in immediately, 3 hours early. The room I stayed in was a suite and having stayed in hotels at Osaka and Fukuoka, at a similar price, I'd say the room was a good size. Special mention: Romain de Charnace from Front Office Guest Relations at the The Royal Park Hotel Tokyo Shiodome. Honestly Romain really made my first visit to Tokyo extra special. If you need to make reservations to restaurants, I HIGHLY recommend Romain. You will not be disappointed! Very quick to respond and accommodates as best as possible. I honestly think that the service I received at the restaurants Romain reserved for me was especially better because the reservation was done via the hotel!

There is a ¥1,000 (~$10USD) charge upon check-in. The Shimbashi train situation is about a 5 min walk away. The room is a good size but taken up by a massive king-size bed; probably what a California king is like (what we realized is they put 2 of their twins together to make this bed). So bags get tight because of this. The room is a bit dated (wall and carpet colors are from an era gone by; furniture is dark and heavy feeling) but the amenities are quite nice. I stayed on the top floor so the ceilings were very high. This gave the room a slightly bigger feel. The bed, like I said, is ginormous. You won’t even know there’s someone else in it with you. It’s firm, which I love. There is, what I think is a water pillow (again, an era long since gone) but with the option of a normal pillow. There is a small closet to hang clothes on and apparently a laundromat downstairs - though we didn’t check it out. An iron is also in the room.Outlets throughout the room but without direct USB ports on the headboard. The safe is a standard size that fits up to a paper-sized folder.There are no true blackout shades. The room was pretty bright in the 5am hour.The bathroom is also a bit tight for 2 people. But you have everything you need in it, including shower caps...the first I’ve seen on this trip to Japan. Again a bit dated compared to some of the other hotels I’ve stayed in. Breakfast was a fair mix of east meets west but with some challenge if you have to leave to go to the bathroom or get something out of your room. Lesson of the day: try not to leave until you’re actually finished. It’s certainly not the nicest breakfast I’ve had in a hotel; it’s not the worst.Live jazz in the lobby bar Thursday through Saturday, if you’re into that kind of thing. They also play jazz throughout the hotel on a regular basis. Also an amazing jazz club called the Cotton Club about a 30 min walk from here (or less by train). There is a money exchange in the lobby, which is very convenient (rate was so-so), but convenience won out.The room is pretty quiet overall; never had any trouble with noise. Never had any problems with a smoke smell anywhere in the hotel. If you stay here, know that you are about 20-30 min, by train, away from most things. As long as that doesn’t bother you, this area will be just fine. If you want to be in the thick of it...you will not find it in this part of Tokyo.

The Tokyo underground system is very complicated as there are several companies offering train service and passes are not interchangeable between systems. For example, the Japan Rail pass does not allow use of the main Tokyo subway system but has limited rail line coverage on a separate system. Some trains and buses to both airports are covered by JR pass so it is a bit bewildering and requires careful study before travel.The signage in the subway for the hotel is dismal, the hotel name was covered at the outdoor sunken courtyard connecting the subway line transfer – Hotel is across the open courtyard and has escalators going up to the entrance. Have the hotel name in English and Japanese and ask directions at one of the convenience stores if lost.The hotel lobby is on the 15th floor after taking the elevator up from the small reception area. There are restaurants and bars on this level and the breakfast room offers lovely views of Mount Fuji in the distance. The Japanese food items are much nicer than the western breakfast items, so it is wise to venture outside your usual comfort zone! The bar items are expensive compared to nearby pubs.The rooms were modern, clean, well equipped and large by Japanese standards. North Americans may find them a bit cramped, but they are more than adequate for a good night’s sleep after a busy day of exploration.We did not have dinner at the hotel as there are several nearby restaurants as well as good food options on the subway connectors.

It is a short walking distance from Shimbashi station ( one stop from Tokyo) and the great thing is the limousine buss from Narita Airport stops right at the hotel. So no need to schlep your heavy luggage through the train stations (especially the Tokyo station is huge and very crowded). When you get off at Simbashi station after your sightseeing, venture out to the other side (not the side the hotel is), there are many cheap Japanese eats favoured by office workers there. I opted for a standard room so it was on a smaller side but I've stayed in smaller rooms elsewhere.

We wanted to buy tickets to the Cup Noodle museum in Yokohama including the ability to make your own noodles. The concierge said we had to book it on our own (they couldn’t do it for us) but when we ran into trouble, she took my smart phone and did all the work. She also was nice enough to translate and write down the instructions on how to pick up our tickets at a Lawson’s store. We had breakfast everyday at the hotel, 3 times at Harmony and once at the Chinese restaurant. Harmony had a good selection of both eastern (miso soup, rice, fish) and western cuisine (eggs, sausage, bacon, cereal bar) and two coffee machines that were being used nonstop. The food selection at the Chinese restaurant was significantly less but you can also order from a select menu. Shi Mai’s and noodles were good, but the egg rolls were a little soggy. Harmony is definitely the more popular of the two restaurants. Location is very central too.

The buildning is not that much when you have the skyscrapers of shimbashi right next to it. But its no big deal. The rooms are located from 27th floor to the 38th floor. 38th floor is premium floor. And you cannot go to another floor less than your own. The room we got was so smal. The bags didnt fit anywhere. Wherever we placed the bags they were in the way and room felt even smaler. But the view from the room was amazing. For 1000 euro for 4 nights we apparatly got economy room when we booked a standard room. If you stay here get upgraded room please. But you can feel luxury all around the hotel. The checkin took forever and we did not get any help with the bags up to our room. Its fine if you book a 3 star hotel but when you pay more for a good hotel with service that should include. And dont look at the bag service to AirPort we got it so wrong. You have to pack and send it 2 days before. So check that up better than we did. But its a great service. Locationwise, the hotel is at the best place in tokyo. Always stay around shimbashi. Best for transportation. Shimbashi station has jr lines and ginza line and Asakusa lineAnd shiodome station had oeido line. So it takes to fast to wherever you wanna go. Tokyo Tower is just a station away. Parking is avalible but little bit hard to find but its huge parkinglot. But not all is for the hotel. You have to go all the way down. I think its not free so of you rent a car ”very wierd to do in Tokyo” call then first and ask about the fee. There are a bar in the lobby floor, not the biggest and its a 500yen table charge.Restaurants is everywhere around the hotel. And really good food.

There were 3 staff at the reception but only 1 of them was attending to guests; I suspect she is trainee as she took a long to time to process my Amex card.I requested for room with a single king-sized during reservation, as I have this pet peeve about leaving one of the beds empty when I travel alone. But I was told the king-size bed was only available in the next room category which would cost twice the price. I took it anyway because I need to spent four nights working in Tokyo therefore good night sleep would be important to me.When I entered my room, I realized that the hotel just pushed two single beds together and passed it off as one bed. I felt cheated! But as it was already close to midnight, I decided against the idea making a fuss and changing my room. After a 6-hour flight, I was hungry and tired, all I wanted was to order food through room service and rest early, but this hotel doesn’t provide room service and the mini bar was empty. To make matters worst, all the restaurants in the hotel were already closed!The day before my departure, I booked the airport limousine bus through the hotel and paid in cash. The ticket was 3100 yen, I gave the staff 5000 yen, and when the staff returned with the ticket and my change, I was momentarily distracted, that I forgot to check my change. The next day when I checked out, the hotel reception told me that I had to return 700 yen to them because the staff who issued my bus ticket yesterday had given me 2600 yen, instead of 1900 yen as my change. But as I had paid in cash, there was no way for me to recall or verify. In the end, I had to take out 700 yen to return to the hotel regardlessly. I don’t think this is fair for me.I would not have mind about the unpleasant experience with hotel reception if I had some well rested nights.

This is a bustling station with food, grocery, and shopping and only 2 stops away from Tokyo Station. It is a lovely hotel with I believe 37 guest floors.

The bathroom has a Japanese style toilet (which you will come to love) and a large shower and separate tub. All very nice.

It was a buffet style with both Japanese and Western fare. It was the same each of the four days we were there, but with enough variety that you could easily eat differently each day. I found myself partaking more of the Japanese fare to further my Japanese experience. It was all very good and plentiful.We have already said if we return to Tokyo we will stay at this same property.

The close proximity to Ginza and the nearby subway have always been pluses to stay here. We were finishing up a two week tour of SE Asia but couldn't resist a stopover in Tokyo even if it was for only one night. We had booked two rooms since we were a family of four. The rooms were small but adequate. The heated toilet and the pajamas were very nice touches.Our flight from Haneda arrived midmorning with one member of our family sick. The staff at the front desk was asked if we could check in early due to this situation. Check was at 3:00. The answer was that no rooms were available, not even one. After a bit of pleading, my daughter remarked that this was our third stay. Miraculously, two rooms were suddenly available. That evening at 9:40, the three of us went to the bar remembering their wonderful cocktails from our last visit. There was a sign with the hours stating closure at 10:00. We asked if we could still have a cocktail and he said he would have to ask the bartender. What? After a few minutes of them discussing if we should be allowed in or not, we were shown a table. We realized we were under time constraints so we quickly ordered cocktails: margarita, Moscow mule and Singapore Sling. I have ordered many Singapore Slings and couldn't even drink this one. It was almost clear in color and had literally no taste. The Moscow mule was average at best. The margarita was served in the tiniest martini glass I have ever seen. Four sips and you are done. We asked for a lime slice to improve the margarita and I said I couldn't drink this Singapore Sling. These cocktails certainly aren't cheap at $14 USD each. I was given another choice of cocktail.We were flying back through Haneda and needed a larger vehicle that would accommodate four adults and six pieces of luggage. At the airport, we were able to have a larger vehicle costing 6,000 yen. We wanted a similar vehicle. I talked to the concierge on duty (January 4) and she could barely speak English. She told me Haneda was an hour away and I corrected her that it was half an hour away. She said it would be cheaper to hire two cabs for 7,000 yen each. I know that wasn't true. She suggested that I talk to the bell captain which I did. He told me that I needed to reserve such a vehicle two days in advance! Are you serious? I just shook my head and went back to the room. An hour later, I received a phone call in the room saying that a larger vehicle was available so I arranged the time. When I was checking out, the front desk person said that if a bell captain calls for a cab, 2,000 yen is added which amounted to $18USD. I couldn't believe it would be that much for a simple phone call. But it was true, our bill to go to Haneda in a similar vehicle we were in before was 8,000 yen.I felt like the B Team staff was working while we were there. The staff was not professional and not helpful. When we were there on the other two occasions, the staff's English was excellent, not the case this time. Look at other options in the area.","Saint Paul, Minnesota","minnesotans4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Paul, Minnesota</strong>",873,3.0

Apart from a location that is within easy strike of both Shimbashi and Shiodome stations as well as the Ginza, the immediate appeal here was that the mainstream guest rooms are larger than Tokyo’s diminutive average. There were a few flaws that rob it of excellence, but it is a convenient and comfortable place to stay and we’ll probably make it our new default Tokyo lodgings.  The good: if driving to the hotel, there’s plenty of check-in parking and unloading space and the bell staff will be all over your luggage as soon as you drive up. The front desk was polite and efficient and English is good all round. Our superior twin corner room (#3001) was clean, quiet, reasonably roomy (38m2), comfortable and pleasantly appointed with 4-star chain hotel vanilla décor. Everything expected was there and it mostly worked as expected. The room provided beds for three, but we used the sofa (bed) for lounging and a bit of cat-swinging space. The twin (3/4) beds were very comfortable, the linens plush and there were enough pillows for each of us to find a favourite. The bathroom ensemble was modern, spacious, well-appointed and almost everything worked like a Japanese watch. Power outlets abound throughout the room and the included WiFi worked OK on all our devices most of the time. There is a DIY coin-op guest laundry on level 26. There are good quality dining options from every corner of the planet within a couple blocks of the hotel. The not so good: the guest room furniture had something of a rummage sale look to it. Not exactly shoddy, but some way short of luxury. The shower water temperature would drop distractingly when the washbasin tap was used or the toilet flushed. The WiFi went to sleep occasionally with both of our phones yet worked well throughout with our notebooks. The rooming light switching was daft – mostly either all on or all off. And there is no light switch at the entry door, just a key card slot which triggers/extinguishes all lights.","Vancouver, Canada","Tedstravelblogs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",860,4.0

But very convenient access to Ginza. The overall hotel staff and service was average, the rooms are very tiny but comparable in size to other Japanese business hotel (but definitely much much smaller than any superchain such as Westin or Hyatt). To be clear, I rarely stay in a Japanese business hotel so maybe someone will say that this is actually much bigger than other business hotels - perhaps a few square feet is a big deal but it is all small to me.In any case, this review is about the lobby bar/lounge on the 24th floor. Sorry this review is a bit long but my business colleagues of mine and I had a really bad experience and it is still bothering me 24 hours later. I've been to this lounge a few times and they always seem to pressure you into ordering a drink. I guess they have a 1 drink/pp policy but I'm not sure. My client and I sat down at one of the tables but before we could even sit down, the server was mumbling something about a drink. Not sure exactly what she said but I said 'thank you' and we sat down. However, she's still standing there giving me an unfriendly look. So I asked, 'do we have to order now?' She started mumbling again about a drink. I said, we haven't decided what to order yet and at that point in time, we haven't even seen a menu. So she goes away, whispers something to her coworker and comes back in 1 minute and asks us about a drink. I said we still haven't looked at the menu, so she then shows us the menu on an iPad. It wasn't the drink menu but anyway we were interested in lunch so we were trying to find what food options they had. This whole time she is just standing and staring with an unfriendly look. So I asked what they recommend for food. She said, 'are you guys going to eat here?' Duh... why else would we ask about the food recommendations. So it turns out we were in the dinner section of the menu and she pointed us to lunch section. They have only a few choices... we ordered the club house sandwich for around 2400 yen and it was just so so. About an hour later, other colleagues who were walking by saw us and sat down to chat with us. The server (a different lady this time) immediately comes and asks them about their drink order. They said they are not interested. So the lady is just hanging around trying to say something except we were talking business and ignoring her. So I said to my colleagues, I think you need to order a drink if you are going to sit down. They said, they don't want anything. All they were trying to do is talk to us which is apparently not allowed. Anyway, because of such a bad atmosphere they left and we were unable to talk business. As I basically live out of hotels and perhaps have a lot experience in this area, I have the following recommendation to the hotel:1. First and foremost, have customer service training. Make customers feel welcomed.  Have a beautiful smile on your faces and be helpful to non-Japanese speaking customers. The servers seemed like they had no training and compared to other hotels in Tokyo, the service was terrible. Please send the lobby lounge manager and workers to the Imperial Hotel to learn what real customer service is like.2. If you have a 1 drink/pp policy, then you should have a host greet you before you sit down and explain this right up front. Don't have a server force you to order a drink and keep hovering around you until you decide on a drink. No customer will enjoy this kind of pressure. 3. Explain how to navigate the menu on the iPad. Don't just hand them an iPad and walk away. If you want the customer to order a drink, then make sure the drink section is shown on the iPad, don't have it on some other menu.4. Re-design the lobby lounge area because it looks like open seating and people will want to sit down. In fact, the hotel has no place for business people to sit/stand and chat. Other hotels such as Westin/Hyatt/Marriott/Conrad have plenty of seating/standing areas where business people can chat. Not in this hotel... the 24th floor is very small and crowded and the only option are the tables in the bar/lounge.Anyway, I'm sure this hotel has plenty of business so they won't care about this review. But I will recommend to my company to never use this hotel again.","Newport Beach, California","kazukiworld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport Beach, California</strong>",7,1.0

From there you walk out into the Shimbashi subway exit. If arriving on the Shimbashi subway I found exit 4 to be closest to the hotel via the B2 entrance.

The hotel lobby is at the 24th floor and lifts can be slow during the morning peak hour around 8:30am. Best to avoid that time.The check in process was quick and easy and staff was helpful. The room itself is slightly dated and can do with a touch up.. But the king size bedroom itself was clean, tidy and spacious enough. It was slightly bigger than other rooms I’ve stayed in Tokyo. I didn’t eat at the hotel as there were many food choices around the hotel. There is a fantastic udon/noodle eatery just downstairs near taco bell. Also there are many restaurants in the Shiodome City Center building just directly across from the hotel and many more choices around Shimbashi subway station.

As there are a number of routes on different levels above ground and underground as well as the road. Google Maps didn’t help much here as it is road based. So we caught a taxi for the 3 minute ride.

We had breakfast at ground level Chaya Organic Foods you can use hotel vouchers or pay direct. Particularly good if your vegan (I’m not vegan). I found the food delicious although very expensive.If you go to B2 level in the lift you will find a day spa and a very small fitness centre ( a few treadmills and dumbbells). B2 is also one way to access the train stations. Exiting from B2 will lead you to the 7/11s in an adjoining building and family marts.There is plenty of restaurants and coffee shops accessible by exiting at this level.Would we stay here again???

The surroundings are packed with suits all day and into the evening. The hotel even sits on top of Shiseido’s main office. The reason a tourist would stay here is the same reason why so many businesses are located here: location. The hotel is a short covered walk from Shimbashi and Shiodome Stations which provide easy train access to the rest of Tokyo’s districts. The hotel is also a few minutes walk to the Ginza and Tsukiji Market areas. There are a good number of restaurants at different prices ranges (McDonald's and Taco Bell on up) within a minute walk. Also 2 Family Mart convenience stores just outside the hotel, carrying very well priced drinks and sundries.The hotel is modern and well-appointed. The only thing traditional is the staff, always courteous and professional. You need to swipe the room card in the elevator to go to your room's floor, a nice security touch. Our 3 bed corner room was large enough to walk around with ease (one bed was a converted sofa). The bathroom was neat and clean and also large. The AC was strong (critical to surviving a July heat wave), and there was an in-room safe. From the room, we had a clear view of the workers in the adjacent high-rises; but then, the hotel windows are not coated for privacy, so be sure to pull your shades down because the workers also have a clear view of you.During our trip, we stayed in 3 different hotels in different parts of Japan, and this was the better of the 3.Oh, except for the coin laundry machines. The machines are new but are combo washer+dryers and don't seem to dry very well; they take about 1000 yen to complete the wash/dry process. Don't try to skimp on the yen and choose less drying time, else you'll be using the hair dryer to finish them off.

Like many places outside of the US, finding a hotel that will allow 4 people in one room is sometimes a challenge. We found this the case as well in Tokyo. The Royal Park offered a great solution! We booked a Junior Suite Twin and requested it be made up for 4 adults. (In Japan kids under 11 can often stay for free in many hotel rooms but only applies to existing bedding, So unless you want your kids sleeping with you in a twin bed, request it be made up for 4 adults). The Royal Park allows this, which gave everyone their own twin bed in the one room! The room itself was very large (really any standard but especially Japanese). Easily fitting all the beds (2 regular beds, 1 rollaway twin and 1 sofa bed type). It was a corner unit with great views of the Tokyo Skytree. It had room for a sitting area, all our ample luggage as well as a large bathroom with separate toilet, makeup area, and sofa/bath. The responsiveness from the hotel pre-trip was great and the service at the hotel was top notch. They gave us good recommendations, directions, umbrellas when it rained, etc. etc. Rooms were dead quiet at night. Beds comfortable. AC worked great in the room. And the location cannot be beat! It's less than 5 minutes to Shimbashi JR station, from which you can really virtually everywhere (and esp good if you have a JR rail pass as all the JR lines are free). It is a 10 minute walk from Tsukiji Fish Market as well. Finally the price was right. We booked through Orbitz (had best deal) but then confirmed everything directly with the hotel.

We booked through Agoda, about 6 months in advance, using the refundable rate (book now, pay later) and reserved a Junior Suite for 2 adults and one teenager. We were delighted at check-in to be upgraded to a corner suite on the 38th floor with a view over the Tokyo tower! It was more like an apartment, with separate lounge/ dining, walk in wardrobe plus a bedroom with a super king sized bed and an extra large and comfortable roll-a-way for our teenage son. The beds had one cooling gel pillow each, plus a more 'normal' one. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we slept well.The bathroom has a separate bath and massage shower in one room, a separate japanese style toilet and a vanity area with basin. Shiseido shampoos, conditioners and body wash are provided as are natural mineral salts for a soothing bath after a long day of site-seeing. There was also a magnifying illuminated mirror provided in the room. In this suite there was also a separate powder room with another japanese style toilet and a basin. The lounge room had a huge TV and there was another one in the bedroom, although we didn't use these.Privacy electric blinds plus block out curtains ensured the room was kept dark.A mini kitchen area had a microwave, coffee/ tea maker (using the provided tea or coffee pods) and a few wine glasses, champagne glasses tumblers and an ice bucket.We made use of the laundromat on the 26th floor. There are six machines (combination washer/ dryers) and a load takes between 1.50 and 2.00 hours, depending on the size. 700 JPY for a bigger load, 600 JPY for a smaller load. Stash your coins as there was no note changer in the laundry room. Powder is 100 JPY per sachet.There was also an ice machine and a vending machine on our floor.The Concierge staff were very helpful and gave assistance whenever we asked.The hotel is conveniently located next to Shiodome station and Shimbashi station is only a short walk away. A Family mart convenience store, Taco Bell, an english style pub and an Italian style restaurant are all located underneath the hotel at street level.We are returning to Tokyo after touring Japan and we are happy that we will return to the Royal Park Shiodome for a couple more nights of bliss.Highly recommended, one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in and we travel a lot.","Maroochydore, Australia","Lindsay H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maroochydore, Australia</strong>",42,5.0

The room was extremely well stocked (better than any hotel I've ever stayed at in any country.) and had everything imaginable from pjs and slippers to all kinds of toiletries.

It hasn’t gotten any faster in the seven years I’ve stayed here. Making calls via WiFi is a pain. I have to go to the hallway to do so or my calls drop. Even simple internet surfing becomes an arduous task. I never have more than two bars on my phone. This is JAPAN for god’s sake! Where technology should be at its finest?? Eye roll emoji. The good news is there’s a laundry room on the 26th floor and the machines will do both washing and drying with one payment. However, if you do a full load, you’ll have to come back and add more time for the drying as it’s ALWAYS damp the first go round. There are smoking “lounges” on the 25th and 26th floor. I put lounge in quotes because like all of Japan, there’s nowhere to sit when you’re smoking. So it’s more of a smoking stand. The hotel is on the Yamanote line, which makes it quite convenient to get to the hot spots like Shibuya and Shinjuku. The hotel is a quiet neighborhood, and a short walk across a large boulevard will get you to a large variety of restaurants that “company men” seem to frequent and get drunk in, so you’ll be hanging with mostly locals. Overall it’s a solid hotel, and the only real problem I have with it is the WiFi. I had better WiFi in Cambodia on this trip, if that says anything.

It's about a 1.5 km walk to the Tsukiji fish market and the Ginza area neighbors the Shiodome. You can get to Shinagawa in 10 minutes and Shibuya (the famous street crossing) in 15 minutes on the JR Yamanote Line. It has plenty of restaurants nearby, both sit down and fast food. For those who prefer to get breakfast outside or don't want to spend the per person rate of 2,500ish Yen/€19/USD $23 (price at time of review) there is a Tully's Coffee right outside the hotel and even a Taco Bell that serves breakfast. Like many train stations in Japan, the Shimbashi station has plenty of eateries, too, (even though it's a smaller station) and they all look wonderful. There is also a Family Mart convenience store right outside the hotel (next to Kinko's). Get my drift on the location? It's ideal with lots of stuff around and close to areas of interest, yet quiet at night because the shopping area and businesses close down. The hotel is beautiful with great views because all rooms are above the 24th floor (that's where the lobby is). Upon arrival, we were upgraded two room levels from a standard double to a deluxe king. The king bed was huge and much wider than any king bed I have ever seen. We estimate it to be around 2.2-2.4 meters wide.

Just slightly further out from Tokyo Station than we usually stay, but this is still in the thick of everything. In many respects its transport links were better than staying close to Tokyo Station. In between Shimbashi station (with its eight lines) or Shiodome station (with its two lines), it is easy to navigate around the city and beyond. In fact, if travelling to Narita airport, it's easier to take the Yokosuka line (rather than the normal Yamanote line) and change at Tokyo, as the Yokosuka line shares the same platform at Tokyo as the Narita Express. That saves a lot of walking and frustration, especially if laden with luggage or travelling with children.The area around the hotel is safe, clean and smart (as virtually all of central Tokyo is). It's a business area, but there are plenty of choices for food nearby. And Ginza is not too far away. Nor is the world famous Tsukiji fish market (at least at the time of writing... it is due to be relocated later in 2018, but has already had this pushed back at least once before). There are ubiquitous convenience stores dotted around the place, including underneath the hotel at ground level, and Shimbashi station has some small but well stocked supermarkets.One downside to my mind is the hotel is not well sign-posted from Shimbashi, and with luggage it is a good 5-10 minute stroll. You need to follow the signs for the Hamarikyu Gardens (浜離宮庭園), walking all the while underground... which makes it easy in any weather. When you reach Tower Records, you are seconds away, and should see signage. You take the lifts up to the Reception Floor, and then have to walk through the lobby to take different lifts up to the room. This might seem like a bind, but is standard for these high rise hotels in Tokyo, and is actually good security.The lobby was always busy. The hotel is clearly popular and so it gets hectic around checking out time. We did not eat in the hotel, even though we were given a discount voucher for breakfast. It was still quite pricey, and the dining room seemed small and so it was crowded. Far easier (and cheaper) to grab something in or around the station.The staff were friendly and professional, and the ones I spoke with were good at English. Of course, better if you can handle Japanese, but I think most will be able to get by. We arrived too early for check in, but they still allowed us to go through the formalities, so that when we returned later that evening, we could simply collect our key and make our way to our room (which already had our bags in there).We booked a junior suite room, and it was well worth the money. Rooms in Japan in general aren't the largest, but this was over 50 square metres and had plenty of space. On a corner, we could see a lot of the city, and it was magical to watch the lights twinkle away at night. Great, too, to be able to see Tokyo Tower and Mount Fuji. There was a fridge, little sink and a microwave. The bathroom, too, was decent and had plenty of good toiletries. Would we stay here again? Or recommend it to friends? Yes, we would. There is a lot of competition in Tokyo, and the standard can be very high. This was a comfortable and modern hotel, but I would not say it is luxurious (although the junior suite is very good). But I am sure we will be back... not least due to the location.","Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom","Naniwa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond-upon-Thames, United Kingdom</strong>",149,4.0

Breakfast was very limited and in a cramped environment. No real choice for non-carnivores and no cheese, hot chocolate or yoghurts/fruit etc.Lack of internal restaurant facilities meant that the nearby Taco Bell and other restaurants/ Family Mart convenience store were visited frequently. No facilities at all after 10pm.Limited conversational English, however this was not specific for this hotel but was a widespread issue throughout Japan. Lack of gym facilities (literally the smallest “gym” I’ve ever encountered in a hotel) with a maximum dumbbell weight of just 10kg and two treadmills. No other body workout machines.Spa excessively expensive at around £250 for an hour for a deep tissue massage. No pool was an issue after 12 days of touring Japan. Would have been a real bonus (even just a jacuzzi).No lobby space to chill out in and also each entrance to get to the room required two lifts and a walk across reception.Consfusion for local taxi drivers with TWO similarly sounding hotels both called “Royal Park”, leading to a couple of expensive errors.Conclusion:Even though we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel, on balance and with the benefit of hindsight, I would not select this hotel again. Advanced booking is essential for trips to Japan as the elite hotels get booked out way in advance.For families, a swimming facility is a benefit, especially as most trips will involve a lot of daytime exertion.","Nottingham, United Kingdom","Bobby A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, United Kingdom</strong>",21,4.0

It's a cheaper way to go to the hotel rather than paying a lot for a cab. It's very safe and convenient. You buy a ticket in the airport. You'll see the limo bus have their own booth. They just have a specific time when the bus arrives and leaves. LOBBY:It's on the 24th floor. The people are very friendly and will assist you in any way.The concierge is VERY helpful as well when it comes to directions. You can always ask for a map if you ever need one. They also give good suggestions on how to get to where you want to go, which tours to get and good restaurants to go to. What I like is they also have a pocket wifi you can rent. They also can arrange your tour bookings and your transportation going back to the airport. They have an umbrella if you need one incase it rains. FOOD: They have 3 restaurants you can choose from for breakfast. The buffet one where we go to. They do not have a lot of choices but its good enough. The other restaurant is Chinese buffet and if I'm not mistaken the last restaurant is for vegetarians. ROOM: We were 3 and stayed in Superior twin room. They have 2 twin beds and 1 couch that they convert to a bed. The room is not super big but in Japan its actually bigger than other hotels. For tall people like 6ft, the bed might be a little short for you. I'm not really happy with their pillow because its very thin but they were nice enough to give me 3 extras just to make me feel more comfortable. They always give you one bottle of water per person per day. I love their shampoo, conditioner and body wash. Its by shiseido because their office is in the same building I think. You have an option to change linens every day. Since the room is not super big and for those who have a lot of huge luggages we had to rearrange the room a bit to make space. They have an air purifier. If I'm not mistaken we were on the 26th floor. I think higher is better. The bathroom is nice. The toilet is TOTO so the seats are heated. The shower and tub is in one shower enclosure which is new to me. All in all it was nice. SERVICE:I did not have any problems with this hotel. I'd most likely come back again. LOCATION:I love the location. Walking distance to Ginza is about 10 minutesWalking distance to Tsukiji fish market is about 15 minutesFrom the hotel you just go down to basement 1 and its walking distance to the metro. There is Shimbashi and ShiodomeAcross the hotel there is a building where they have a lot of restaurants to choose from. There is a nearby cafe incase you need your daily fix of caffeine. There are 2 family marts on basement 1 of the hotel. ITS A REALLY GOOD LOCATION. Not too crowded but close to Ginza. FREE WIFI. But I had issues with the speed of their wifi.

Convenient location, it is within a business district, above Shiodome Station and walking distance to Shimbashi Station. There were a few restaurants downstairs and a Family Mart which helps when you suddenly have the urge for some snacks.Overall a good stay.

We had a good view of Tokyo from our corner room, which was spotlessly clean and spacious. My favorite thing about the Royal Park hotel would have to be the bathroom amenities - particularly the beautiful soap, shampoo and conditioner from Elementis - divine woody smells and left my skin and hair feeling soft. The only negative i would have about the room is that we found the huge king bed a bit hard for our taste, and the pillows too soft/ feathery.The service from staff throughout the stay was welcoming.Breakfast was served in the atrium. It's a somewhat small selection but covers nearly everything you could want - Japanese optics, eggs three ways, hot and cold meats, salads, fruits, grains and pastries. My only feedback would be to review the way that hot food is kept warm as the current version isn't very effective and things tended to lean on the cooler side. The hotel is located in the business district above a subway, very close to the fish markets and with plenty of restaurants. Has a slightly quieter feel we enjoyed coming back to.

The problem is every hotel we stayed at was clean and beautiful, with above and beyond service. This hotel was great, and if it was an American hotel, I'd be blown away, but it just fell short in terms of excellent Japanese hospitality. For example, we left our baggage there for the day because the room was not ready (we were there early, so not the hotel's fault at all). When we came back to check in, they brought us our baggage in the lobby. This is of course, all well in fine, BUT in other Japanese hotels (of the same price and caliber), when we left our luggage at the hotel, once the room was ready they would bring it up for us.

Picked the hotel after reading reviews citing proximity to metro and outstanding breakfast options but was very much disappointed. I stay in hotels roughly 30 times a year and I had the worst check in experience I’ve experienced here. The girl who checked me in could barely speak English and was not empowered to make decisions. I booked 3 rooms - two of which were on premium floors and one on a standard floor because there were no premium floor rooms available with 2 separate beds at time of booking. The front desk girl said she noticed this and informed me that her premium two bed rooms were just king rooms with the beds taken apart and that she had plenty available if I wanted to upgrade the standard room. I agree of course. Then she went back on her word and said she couldn’t actually upgrade me even though she had a lot available and instead had to charge me 5000 yen for the upgrade. I agreed again and after looking into her system again, she said she was mistaken and actually had to charge me 30,000 yen for the upgrade. This whole ordeal took over 30 minutes and she eventually went into a room to speak with her manager who offered us a discount to 20,000 yen. Ridiculous as I did not expect an upgrade but she had offered for free, retracted, then offered again for multiple different prices. She also spoke really poor english so perhaps some of it was also due to her trouble in communicating, which is shocking for a front desk staff at an international hotel. In the end, there really was barely any difference between the standard and premium rooms anyway.Breakfast was your basic spread with miso soup but other than that there were no other japanese options or Chinese options. Since this is a big international hotel and the breakfast reviews were so great I at least expected noodles cooked to order, more japanese options and some dimsum.","New York City, New York","Laurie H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,2.0

Despite us keying in our travel party of 2 adults and 1 child (which was exactly the same price if we had specified 3 adults), we were still billed by the hotel for the child's bed and breakfast. Fortunately, after a few rounds of negotiation, the merchant agreed to reimburse us for this extra cost.Despite the hiccup above, we did enjoy our stay in the junior suite. It was spacious (around 56 sq m). The beds (even the sofa bed) was comfortable. Room ventilation and temperature control was good. Wifi connection was complimentary and adequate. We liked the little kitchenette space with its sink, as it was convenient to get and boil water to prepare the kid's milk.We loved the long row of tabletop space behind the bed head with its vanity mirror. Plentiful space to deposit our cosmetics, moisturisers, vitamins, purses etc.The hotel provides only 1 bottle of mineral water per person per day. Any extra is chargeable, which was a first for us in Tokyo. Since the tap water in Japan is safe for consumption and there was a thermos flask boiler in the room, this was not an issue. We saw many tourists and tourist groups in this hotel and thought this could be a reason why extra water is chargeable.While the airport limousine bus stops directly at the hotel, the timings are extremely limited. We were very fortunate to be able to catch the 8:45am bus that got us straight to the hotel. Otherwise, an alternative would be to take the bus to TCAT station (where there were plentiful limo bus timings) and catch a cab to the hotel. The cab ride costs around JPY1500-2000.It was convenient to walk to the Shimashi station via B2. Be sure to bring along your winter coat as the underground walkway is not heated nor enclosed.We cabbed to Ginza for a mere JPY700 (same price as 3 train tickets to Ginza) and walked to Tsukiji for our food and shopping. This accessibility was the primary reason for choosing this hotel. The secondary reason was the suite deal. Hotels in Tokyo are generally small and expensive and do not accommodate 3 pax. For what we paid, we thought it was good value for money. In fact, the king bed turned out to be big enough to sleep 3 pax very comfortably.Breakfast was decent but we really preferred dining at Tsukiji. There are several bakeries and cafes in the Shiodome/Shimbashi area (we LOVED!!!! the Katsu pork sandwiches) so I would personally recommend to give the hotel breakfast a miss. From our experience, the ala carte order-to-cook breakfast selections available in certain hotels are really the ones worth paying for in Tokyo. We were disappointed to find very lacklustre fruits from the buffet, given how easy it is to buy really sweet and good quality fruits in Japan.

The building looks like either an office block or an apartment building rather than an actual hotel, and I presume that's the function of the lower floors. Reception is on the 24th floor and the signage on the ground and first floors where you enter the lifts could be better. The hotel itself is fine though. Rooms are a little small by Australian standards but adequate. As in Japan everywhere the rooms are clean and everything works. The staff were excellent, very helpful, and even got us a booking at Narasawa, a notoriously difficult restaurant to get into. The hotel sits right above the subway which as usual in Tokyo is large, busy and has multiple exits, so pay attention the first time you use it to save wandering around on your return.The Limousine bus stops at the hotel for airport transfers and staff will take your luggage and store it next to the pick up point if you're not leaving until later.You have three choices for breakfast, standard buffet, a Chinese buffet or a macrobiotic option, all served in different locations. We tried the first two and they we both fine. The main buffet does get busy though, and sometimes guests were waiting for a table.There is a gym seperate to the hotel on the ground floor. Basic, small and again it gets very busy.On the 26th floor is a laundry. You can wash and dry 3.5kg load for Y700 but be warned, once you start it takes 2.5 hours and you can't stop the machine once it starts, so make sure you have time (I presume if you turned the power off that might do it but I didn't try).

We have previously stayed in the Park Hotel nearby but thought we'd have a change.The hotel is stylish and well-located, being walking distance to numerous metro lines that will take you anywhere around the city. A ten minute walk north past Shimbashi station will also take you to a long, vibrant street full of restaurants and bars of all varieties which is definitely worth a look in the evening.There are restaurant options in the hotel, including a nice but overpriced Chinese restaurant we tried on our first night. The hotel bar features a great view, but the 'happy hour' didn't make me particularly happy when the only beer option was a bottle of Asahi for over £5.As for the room itself, we stayed in a high double room which was clean and modern with a great view of Tokyo Tower. Unfortunately this was easily one of the smallest rooms we have ever stayed in. Like most foreign tourists, our visit to Japan would take us all around the country so we had two fairly large cases. There was nowhere to put anything and the room looked like it had been ransacked within about five minutes.Finally, I think we made a huge mistake. After 20 long hours of traveling via a connecting flight, they didn't offer a congratulations at check in like the other hotels. Assuming they had forgotten, we entered our room a bit disappointed. There was a bottle of red wine on the table but no card except a generic one welcoming us, so I assumed we would have to pay for it as if it was a mini-bar item. Having read other reviews, I think this was a freebie that we did not consume! If only we'd known. Now I feel like an absolute fool. Perhaps the card should have been clearer, or perhaps I should have drunk first and asked questions later.This is a good hotel and a strong choice for Tokyo, but you may want to reconsider if you have a lot of luggage.","Neath Port Talbot, United Kingdom","WelshTom25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Neath Port Talbot, United Kingdom</strong>",46,4.0

The hotel offers 3 breakfast venue options (we got booking with breakfast which is always our preference) - international buffet, Chinese and healthy. We only tried the international buffet - and the hotel should consider offering more selections, considering its stature. Room cleaning can also take a while (although impeccably done each time), such that for the first two days, we would arrive in the afternoon with the room still unkept. That’s when we decided to always hang the “make up room” tag each time, and our room would always be cleaned almost right away. Bathroom and room amenities are definitely five star. We had a mini kitchen with microwave and a nespresso machine. Will go back to this hotel.",Makati City,"Majojam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Makati City</strong>",27,4.0

We were also allowed to check in slightly earlier than the usual 3pm check in time as we flew in to Haneda at 7:30am. After turning up to the hotel mid-morning we were able to leave our heavy cases and were told we could come back between 12pm and 1pm when our room would be ready. This was great as we didn’t have to kill as much time in between as we originally thought and meant we can get refreshed/rested in the room sooner. After an 11.5hr flight all we wanted to do was chill out and I praise the hotel staff for allowing us this option.Our room was a standard king room on the 37th floor (one below the top premium floor) and had fantastic views of Tsukiji market and Hamarikyu Gardens. As this was our honeymoon we were also gifted a lovely bottle of wine in our room which was a nice touch. I know people have commented on room size before saying they were small in their opinion but personally i thought our room was a decent size (at least for 2 adults anyway). The bed was huge, bigger than anything i’ve slept on anywhere else and although I thought the mattress was a little hard to my liking it didn’t impact our sleep luckily.The bathroom was a real highlight for us as we had both a separate shower and bath tub and absolutely amazing shower pressure. So many hotels i’ve seen before with a barely satisfying pressure however even on the 37th floor it was fantastic and very invigorating. Towels and toiletries were replaced everyday by the room cleaning staff and the whole room was left spotless.The only noise we could here from the room was either some minor bangs or flushing of toilets by neighbouring guests and the odd police/ambulance siren from the street below but nothing too bothersome so I wouldn’t let that put anyone off.As many others have said too, the hotel is extremely well connected for trains/subway with only some minor walking needed to ultimately give you access to all of Tokyo. We regularly used the Toei Oedo Subway line from the Shiodome station sat right outside the hotel along with the Yurikamome line from the same station (different platform). Also the neighbouring Shimbashi station was only a 5-10 min walk away and gives you access to a number of lines including the Yamanote (loop) line that connects all the major sightseeing districts like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ueno and Akihabara to name but a few.In summary we would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat if we ever find ourselves back in Tokyo again.

Walkway is conveniently covered for when it rains. • Incredible service from the hotel staff. Friendly, knowledgeable, and speak English fluently. Their guest services desk really helped us a lot with directions, restaurant recs, and general advice with getting around town. • Quiet rooms. I’m a light sleeper and couldn’t hear a thing in our room. Rooms start on the 26th floor so you don’t hear any street noise, and it’s in a quiet area. The views from most of the rooms are great too. • 24 hr Convenience store downstairs. This saved us a ton of money. We were able to get nice pastries, coffee, and other snacks throughout our trip. They accept credit cards and have an ATM that takes Visa. When you get up at 4 am bc of jetlag and need some food, this will be a godsend, trust me. Glad we did this instead of the expensive breakfast options. • Nice and clean gym. Better than most we looked at while searching. It has 2 treadmills, 2 spin bikes, 2 ellipticals, a set of weights that goes up to 25 lbs, and a few benches. We went here everyday and we felt amazing because of it! • Walkable to Ginza and the Tsujiki fish market (about 15 minutes for either). Cons: • It’s in a business district. On 1 hand this means that it’s quiet at night (which I prefer), but you won’t be in a happening area like Shinjuku if you’re trying to get to a lot of eateries quickly. Feels like a business hotel. • Food options right outside the hotel are limited. If you’re looking to go right outside and have a ton of food options, this ain’t the hotel for you. But Ginza and the fish market are only 15 mins away. • Laundry room kinda sucks. Dryers took forever. If you’re looking for a quiet hotel with incredible service that’s connected to really anywhere in Tokyo (mostly bc Tokyo has public transportation figured out), this is a great option.","San Francisco, California","jeff8970</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",10,5.0

I did read some Trip Advisor reviews where the rooms seemed small and a bit dated, so maybe it depends on which room/floor you are staying in.

Tokyo taxis now start at 410 yen (they recently dropped prices for small distances) and are a great option for families of 4 over the subway. We found that due to the central location of this hotel we could take taxis 50% of the time. So for me, this hotel was all about its location. It's a 5 on location, 5 on modernity, plushness, breakfast and service . All top class . But a 3 on room size. If you are really particular about size this is not the place for you. I booked 2 entry twin rooms (for 2 adults and 2 kids ) on a great deal at one of the sites but had to upgrade as the room is too small even for one adult and 2 kids with two suitcases. Even the upgraded room - which wasn't a great deal post the upgrade charge - was a bit cramped.

The amenities were nice and plentiful, be it shampoo, razors, toothbrushes or necessities for the bathroom or things for eating and drinking in the main room.Power-supplies were also plentiful, and even though 90% of the power-outlets were US/Japanese standard, the hotel provides a multi-adapter outlet on the desk in the room as well. This converter, in addition to having two multi-type 110v power outlets, also had two USB outputs, one for mobile and a stronger one for tablets, very nice and practical.Also, check the drawers too, since the hotel provide a physical network-connection in the desk, as well as the correct cable, should you have the need.We initially believed the air-condition to be faulty in our room and wanted to change rooms (something which the hotel did their best to arrange although they were quite fully booked), but after around 30minutes to 1 hour, the room was indeed chilled down adequately. (it was just a little slow and weak, but it did the job nicely), so we called down to abort any room-changes.- Still, kudos for the staff to try to resolve the issue and also sending a man up to our room to check the A/C properly.As mentioned before, the location is great in regards to public transport. It is also a nice location regarding food; The malls in the towers have a multitude of options, but try the smaller side-streets for ramen and other japanese food, it's generally cheaper and also better than the mall-options.Tip: There is a Family-mart in the B1F floor, this is also where you walk to the Ginza-line, Asakusa-line or the Odeo-line.You can walk underground from Shimbashi station to the towers, just follow the signs towards Shiodome-towers from Exit 4.Our room was pretty close to the elevator, but we never heard a thing from it. (I have hearing like a bat, so any noise gets to me really easily), very quiet and no noise from other guests.The only two things I can place on the neutral/negative side, is slow-wifi for the most part and somewhat hard/thin pillows (two for each bed), but this is almost nitpicking, the hotel in general is very very nice.Everything about the room was clean, practical and also quite stylish, we have no regrets staying here at all and will be staying here the next time we are in Tokyo.",Oslo,"znapper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oslo</strong>",36,5.0

I was offered a view overlooking the Tokyo Tower for a slight additional fee, but I was quite happy with the views from the other side of the building.

Service staff was generally helpful in responding to your queries and requests, although perhaps because of the size of the hotel, everything seemed mechanically efficient and I would have liked some heart. Breakfast was fairly standard - after the second morning, we realised that despite having 3 different breakfast locations, the spread was rather limited and got boring.

Needless to say I was very satisfied with the hotel for my recent business trip to Tokyo. The location is quite central considering I visited customers in Shizuoka, Saitama,Yokohama, and Tochigi. The Shimbashi station which is within easy walk (5 minutes) from the hotel is quite convenient.After work, I enjoyed the walk to explore Ginza and its small streets parallel to the main drag (Chuo-dori) and the small alleys near Shimbashi station. Hamarikyu garden is behind the hotel but was a little tricky to get to due to construction. From Hamarikyu we catch the riverboat to Asakusa temple. Tsukiji fish market is also within 10 minutes on foot from the hotel.The hotel is quite beautiful and all rooms are guaranteed beautiful view of Tokyo. It is because the guest room begins at 26th floor with the lobby located in the 24th floor. Below the hotel is the Shiseido's offices and headquarter.My room is about 200 sqf with a nice view of the Tokyo Tower (the original tower). The room is good size for Japan and is very well furnished with iron/board, safety box, fridge, work desk and complete with fast wireless internet to do office work through VPN. It was nice that that the hotel provides Fabreeze (fabric freshener) in the room - I sweat a lot due to warm and fairly humid days during my stay. The hotel also have a laundry facility in the 26th floor and cost about 700 Yen per load (wash & dry).The room is modern and clean and the bathroom has bathtub and an electronic Japanese toilet. The vanity is heated and it is a huge heat source, so I always turn off the bathroom light to keep the room cool. The AC worked very well despite the hot days and exposure to sunlight during the day. Housekeeping is typical Japanese attention to detail and very impeccable.Staff throughout the hotel was very friendly and always very welcoming. I left Japan only 5 days ago and I already missed their hospitality. The reception staff was excellent - check-in and check-out was a breeze. And a big thank you for providing me with a room when I checked in at 8 am. For English speaking guest, the room TV has 2 English channel - CNN International and BBC. The rest are Japanese, Korean, Chinese, and one German channel (DW).The included breakfast gives guest 3 choices - Western/Japanese restaurant which is quite popular and therefore can be crowded at times, Chinese restaurant which is quite small and not so popular, and a vegetarian restaurant in the ground floor which I didn't bother to visit. There is direct Limousine bus from Narita, however you need to take the Keikyu airport train to/from Haneda which is quite cheap at 530 Yen one way.I will definitely stay at Park Royal the Shiodome in my next visit to Tokyo.",,ANoto-Traveller,17,5.0

It’s not right in the middle of the action, but close enough to Shiodome station with its private line and a 3 minute walk to Shimbashi station for JR lines. The advantage of being a little further out is that it’s a little cheaper and the rooms are bigger! Ginza is a 5-10 minute stroll, so you are still close to lots of great shopping and food options. The bed was huge and the comfortable, with the room always nicely cleaned by the time we got in from the day’s adventures. We didn’t bother with breakfast as there is a mini-mart at the bottom of the hotel with any kind of food and drink you could want. We wanted to go to Chaya Macrobiotics but the timing never seemed right for its opening times/meal times… We had a lovely night at the bar on our last night with the bar tender (Tadeshi – apologies for any incorrect spelling or interpretation) being lovely and chatty – much better English than our poor few Japanese words and phrases. Excellent bar tender and lovely man! tip to find the hotel - if you’re coming from Shimbashi station, go underground and follow the signs to Shiodome station. The hotel is one of the buildings that sits on top of Shiodome Station. You’ll be in an underground walkway until you see an open air section on the right with a couple of restaurants, and some large stairs and escalators. The building is to the left of these big stairs/escalators. The bottom of the building houses Shiseido – the entrance to the building at that level looks very much like an office building, but the elevators will take you to reception.","Coffs Harbour, Australia","Tistybus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coffs Harbour, Australia</strong>",96,5.0

Royal Park Hotel is a wonderful hotel in a quieter area of Ginza and is basically a 5 minute walk from all the trains. After checking in we were pleasantly surprised to find our room on the 33rd floor to be very spacious (for tokyo standards) and offered an incredible view of Ginza (see photos). We stayed in a King room for 4 nights, the bed was really comfortable and the bathroom spacious with a bathtub and shower. Although this is a mega hotel located in a huge complex of businesses, shops, it still felt very down to earth and personal. The staff was very helpful and friendly, and most spoke english and Japanese. Service was excellent, no complaints. There are a couple options for dining (you can eat at their bar, or the restaurant that has a buffet breakfast). We ate breakfast at both, and the food was really good. Getting from Narita Airport to the hotel i'd advised booking the shuttle. The Friendly Limo bus from Narita airport to hotel ($29 US, 3100yen) can get you to the hotel, buy a ticket at shuttle desk. (A taxi to the hotel will cost you a staggering $120 US). Or take the Narita express train to tokyo station, then cab it to the hotel (if you're feeling adventurous and confident).

Yes it is conveniently located for a major metro system station, the fish market (soon to move) and Ginza (a high-end shopping district). However, given the size of Tokyo, I would not say a big attraction of this hotel is the location (the attractions we preferred were all in the Shibuya / Shinjuku area to the West).We stayed during the week when the hotel is clearly geared up for business travellers. It also seems to regularly host conferences so the reception / bar area was always busy with people on business. The main attraction of the hotel is probably the bar that overlooks part of Tokyo. It does however seemingly attract non-hotel guests though given the hotel’s proximity to a number of major offices. The rooms are nicely designed albeit on the small side. Most afford scenic views over Tokyo. We had a premium floor room given that we travelled with our 9 month old daughter so needed slightly more space. Travelling as a couple or solo, the extra cost of a premium floor room is not worth it given the only other perk bar the slightly bigger room was complimentary drinks from the mini-bar.As to breakfast, it was okay at best. It caters for western breakfast tastes but did have a slight canteen feel and was busy seemingly at all times.On the whole, with a family, I would certainly not stay here again.

If you are looking for service levels that match the expensive room rates, look elsewhere. I've stayed at this property several times and my most recent experience firmly convinced me toward other alternatives in the area, e.g., Conrad, or even Villa Fontaine Shiodome.Disappointments: room not ready at check in, 15 minutes to receive my beer at the bar (while waiting for my room), another 10 minutes to settle the check at said bar, chirashi-don at the prestigious Tankuma Kitamise restaurant resembling cat food (literally scraps of leftover fish, some with bone and ligament still attached to it), and so on.

The hotel itself has some very nice views from the restaraunts especially at night. The view from my room on the 29th floor was reasonable across the city but mainly was looking at another building - can't have great views in every room so no issue with this point. I am an avid gym user and down in the 2nd floor basement is a small gym with around six cardio machines - running, steppers and bike - and a very small selection of weights and a yoga mat. The only downside to the gym is that it is very warm down there and no sign of air condioning which was evident when on ones own but was excacerbated when more than one to the point of sauna like conditions. Anyway, the hotel was very pleasant, lovely comfortable bed and all you would expect from a hotel of this type.

The room with Tokyo Tower room was tight and not on par with other rooms at the same price level around town. Bathroom did have Shiseido products and amenities for every need, but was tight and lacked counter space for personal care items.The included breakfast was average-- and the overall layout of the breakfast (western breakfast restaurant to be specific) was poor and could not handle high traffic. The buffet was hard to maneuver, especially when the restaurant was full. There is only one espresso coffee machine, to which there is always a line of people waiting. I'd try the other restaurants for breakfast, as the room for western breakfast was just crowded and hot.I've lived/stayed in Japan for 8 years, so I know that Japan puts price premium on spacious rooms and amenities. But this was a disappointment. On the plus side, Japanese service levels in this hotel are very high and customer focused.

I searched many hotels and this hotel seems to have the biggest room for the price range. It's almost as big as an Air BnB apartment (50 sq m). The room we had was a long rectangular shape. We get 2 single bed and a long sofa that doubles as a 3rd bed which my adult son slept pretty comfortably for 5 days. The bathroom is huge. It has a separate compartment for toilet and another for shower. 2 sink counter with plenty of nice brand amenities. The water and drink in the refrig are complimentary. I wanted a room with Tokyo Tower view, but I was told our room configuration doesn't face that direction. So we only get office building views and reflections of the sunrise off the office buildings.The hotel starts on 24th floor of a business building. So you have to take elevator up to the 24th floor to the reception area, then take another elevator up to the hotel rooms. Can't commend much on the hotel staff because we hardly stayed in the hotel or used any of their services. But as we come in and out, the concierge always greeted us with smiling faces. 1.The most amazing thing is the toilet. The lid lifts up as you walk in, flush automatically, then closes the lid after you left. Everything was remotely controlled by this keypad on the wall of the ""toilet room"". It even has a ""fragrance"" button that you can use. Not sure how useful it is though. I was a little unused to/sad after I left Japan that I have to do everything manually again. 2. One of the reason I chose this hotel besides it's big room and location was that the limousine bus from either Narita or Haneda airport stops at this hotel. It is a big plus if you have many luggage to haul around. You do have to pay for the limousine bus. About $30 pp from Narita one way.3. Location is pretty convenient. 3 minute walk to the closest subway line. A little further (5-7 min) for the other subway lines and JR Shimbashi station. One of the subway line here takes you directly to Haneda airport. The train that goes to Odaiba also stops here. You can take a 10-15 min walk to Ginza. Depends on what you plan to do, I found myself going mostly to places on the west side of Tokyo. In that case, staying around Shinjuku might have saved me some time traveling back and forth.

Their English is not as good as those staffs in the front desk but at least you can talk with them. There are three restaurants in the hotel, which mean you have three choices for breakfast.

Perfect location.The hotel is a very modern one, stilysh decorated and needless to say, perfectly clean.Our room was located in an upper floor and despite it is small (we travel with our kids ages 12 & 15 and need to book two rooms) it is on Japanese space standart (well actually NY standarts are not much bigger...). Decoration is tasteful, bathroom has all you may need, and all the electronics you may require. The view was absolutelly incredible, since in a clear day we saw not only Tokyo tower, but also Mt.Fuji! Amazing.Bar and restaurantes are Ok, but a litle expensive, which is not a problem since there are plenty of restaurants in the area. A convenient store is also located just at the entrance of the hotel.Quality/Price is in good average, and service is excellent.

We were a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children) and the hotel was more than happy to accommodate us in one room. The king bed was HUGE and slept 3 ppl with plenty of room left, and they prepared a separate sofa bed which was also very comfortable. The room decor is immaculate, beautiful and tasteful. We tried bot the Western and Chinese breakfast buffet on separate occasions and found it serviceable. It could definitely be better especially since it wasn't cheap. We ordered hot chocolate from the buffet for the kids and were charged extra for it. A little odd. The hotel is connected to the subway station which is extremely convenient. We were so well located and it was an absolute treat to have your hotel literally 2 mins walk from the station as it was cold and we were quite often out for the whole day and would return tired. You can also walk to the main Ginza area from the hotel in about 5-7 mins. Tully's and McDonalds are nearby so we spent a few mornings having breakfast there instead of the hotel breakfast.

The bathroom was spacious with a decent amount of bench space, and a large round mirror (and although I'm not a man I found the shaving mirror useful too!). The location is convenient to everywhere, close to Shimbashi and Shiodome stations (3 stations altogether) with direct access to multiple different train lines including for example the Yamanote Line which loops around all the main Tokyo city neighbourhoods, the Yurikamome line which goes to Odaiba (Tokyo Bay), two metro lines, various out-of-town lines, etc. There are heaps of shops and restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, including a convenience store and gift shop on ground level close to the elevator to the hotel reception area. Ginza is only 10 minute walk (or very quick subway trip). It can be a bit confusing trying to find the hotel the first time when arriving by train at Shimbashi, just keep following the signs to Shiodome and take the station underground passage heading for Shiodome Sio Site.

The biggest mistake we made was not staying longer - here! It was me, DH and my two DS, ages 6 and 12. We were very kindly upgraded to a corner room on the 24th floor with a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower and the rest of the city. We could even spy Mt. Fuji behind the Tower - I mean, you can't get a better view than that! Four people in one room is usually tight but this was setup with two of their beds (sized between a US twin and double) shoved together for the adults and 6 yo to share, and then in the 'lounge area' of the room, a sofa was made into a very comfy bed with some privacy for the 12 yo. The arrangement was superb, especially for our purposes and it was the only time during the whole 10 day vacation we had enough room for all our luggage. The bathroom was very well-designed with a 'wet room' (tub and shower in one separated part of the bath area), if somewhat in need of repair (the floor tiles were eroding from use). The TOTO commode had all the features one expects in a nice Japanese hotel, and the selection of toiletries / amenities was expansive and high-quality. The trend in Japan seems to be to offer full-sized bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body wash, then freeing up funds to offer things like hairbrushes, hairbands, facemasks and exfoliating mitts. They even had room slippers in a size for my 6 yo. So cute!!The beds were comfy and firm and the pillows were nice. Other than the floor tile in the bath, the place seemed recently renovated or was holding up very well. It had no funky odors and there was even an air cleaner if you felt the need for one. There were options for light control on the many windows, from nothing to let in the maximum amount of light, to sheers for privacy and full black-out blinds if you needed darkness for sleep. There was a small couch (which was made into a bed for us) and seating area with two more chairs and 2 small tables. If only two were staying there this would have been really roomy, especially by Tokyo standards.

Light controls and a small chest of drawers next to the bed were ideal.Bathroom was good - the very small bathtub/shower over were fine for showering but there was no way I was trying to bath in it :) good sink and shaving mirror - and yes the water does get very hot which is ideal for a wet shave.There was no wardrobe but there is a small alcove with hangers for your clothes.A nice touch - some Japanese pyjamas to wear (although they were a bit small for me!) as well as a fridge to keep drinks in - not forgetting complimentary mineral water every day. Nice one.The breakfasts are good with plenty of choice - juices, hot drinks, toast, fresh fruit, cereals, salads, cold meats and cheeses, cooked breakfast including bacon, sausage and eggs. They were quite expensive though so my advice is to fill up at the start of the day.Wifi was good and consistent throughout my stay of 12 days and I didn't have to constantly re-enter my credentials which was a nice change. Not the strongest signal in the world but hey - it's free.There are washing machines and a drier on the 26th floor but I didn't get to use them.Vending machines on every floor to dispense drinks at a reasonable charge - watch out for the tiny black cans of coffee though with a red flame logo - when they come out they are red hot! I'm surprised I didn't wake the whole floor up when I picked it up.... the little yellow cans are sake or shochu too. Don't repeat my error of taking it to work thinking it was a lemon energy drink...Getting about - the hotel has it's own station at Shiodome, and it is also only 5 minutes walk (undercover) from Shimbashi station. To get to Tokyo Station just take the JR line which is about 200 yen and 10 minutes ride. Plenty of shops nearby - there is a Family Mart outside the hotel (go down to B2, turn right then left out of the lift, then right again out of the door and it's there) for any drinks/snacks/anything else whatever the time of day. There is a McDonald's nearby but I wouldn't recommend it. If you love authentic street food, head towards the Shimbashi station and walk through into Shimashi itself. Plenty of restaurants very reasonably priced. Checking out was a breeze - no problems and again, everyone so friendly and polite. Definitely a hotel I would recommend to stay in when visiting Tokyo whether business or pleasure.","Swindon, United Kingdom","MrPeteUK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Swindon, United Kingdom</strong>",39,5.0

This hotel is in The Shiodome (attached to the Shimbashi subway stop), so the location is incredibly convenient. The lobby of the hotel is located on the 24th floor of the Shiodome tower, and then the rooms extend up to the 38th floor. Terrific views of Tokyo from all sides - we had two rooms for our group, and one of them had a direct view of Tokyo Tower. Rooms came with complimentary breakfast at one of the two lobby restaurants (one of them serves a 'Western-style breakfast' that would look familiar to Americans, and the other is called a 'Chinese-style' breakfast. We chose the Western breakfast, and it was excellent, so I can't speak to the Chinese-style breakfast). The hotel does not have room service (that I could see), but there are plenty of places to eat within easy walking distance. Best of all, we flew out of Narita Airport after checking out, and the hotel was able to arrange bus tickets ('Friendly Airport Limousine') - we paid for the tickets on our hotel bill, and the bus picked us up right at the hotel, so we didn't have to load suitcases into a taxi (or the subway). Wonderful stay! I definitely would recommend.","Saratoga, California","syrupwaffle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saratoga, California</strong>",5,5.0

Lobby is very nice and people are friendly. English is spoken but with difficulty. We had reserved at a different Royal park Hotel and after our very long trip realized our mistake upon arriving at the hotel. The front staff was friendly and tried to find us a good rate for our weeklong stay. An hour later, the rates were still outrageously high. They even searched for us on some Japanese websites to no avail. I thought to do a quick search myself and sure enough found a rate about a third of the price quoted by the hotel. Exhausted we proceeded to go to our room. The rooms are very very small. Our window was directly in front of another building so opening the curtains was really not an option. If not for the much reduced price I found online, I would have been furious to pay what the published room rates are. Since we were so tired we decided to order room service for dinner. Come to find out there is NO ROOM SERVICE in this huge hotel! Dragged ourselves out and proceeded to go to the Japanese restaurant on site. There is no english menu. Fantastic servers tried to explain in broken english the menu to us. We proceeded to order. The service was immaculate and so very friendly. However, the food was just ok and extremely pricey.

What it lacked though is an access for direct train to to and from Airport (Narita and Henda). You will need to change a couple of train services which may be cumbersome given the wide network of train services within the whole of Tokyo. Hence it will be a task to move around with your heavy luggages in the tow going up and down the stations which might lack in escalators unless you are able to locate the elevators. However, you may overcome this cumbersome journey to and from the airport by booking a direct airport bus service which is convenient.On and around the immediate location of this hotel very much lack much in amenities. Hence, I would rate this hotel more for business travellers for it's quietness rather than tourists. A walk further (7 minutes) towards Shimbashi Station, you may find pretty decent nice food outlets on the streets. Must admit that the room size is decent and ample when compared to general sizes of hotels (2-3 stars). It is very clean. Front desk is excellent and so is the concierge services. Helpful to note that they have hot water and ice maker machines available in common areas of every floor which is complimentary. A plus point indeed.Check in is at 1500 hours whilst check out is 1100 hours but you may request for 1200 hours late check out.What surprises you is that in general, is that Japanese breakfasts are late in serving. Some establishments are open from 1000 hours whereas majority will start operations at 1100 hours. So suggest stock up sandwiches the night before from convenience stores if you are planning early on the go.The hotel is located a train station away from the fish market. Worth the visit there. You may also decide to take a 15 minutes walk to the fish market. Fresh serving of sashimi in abundance. A party of 4 should put you down between US$150-200 in total. Some may consider this pricey whereas others may consider it fairly reasonably priced for such a fresh food. The restaurants at the fish market are open very early. There are more than a few dozens shops to choose from. My advice is to join the longest queue to ensure freshest and a reasonably priced restaurant. Mistake I did was to join the shortest queue and it wasn't so fresh as the first restaurant I tried and also it appears to be pricier than the first one.

The room was spacious and the view was amazing. They provide shiseido shampoo/conditioner and body wash. They also give you a cobigelow products for make up remover and lotion. They provide tooth brushes and blow dryer as well. This hotel basically provides all your daily necessities. If you are a smoker, there is a small smoking section INSIDE the lobby, where you can smoke at. My boyfriend enjoyed this because he didn't have to go outside to smoke.

The hotel is very well positioned to make all your trips in and around Tokyo as it has easy access to Shimbashi station and a number of metro lines. The Shodome is a little unusual in that reception is on the 24th floor of the hotel and so its a lift ride up to there - check in and then a lift to your room. The website gives all the details on transport and it is very useful. It is very easy to get around Tokyo from here. As with many Tokyo hotels, do not expect vast amounts of space but I found the room to be very well appointed and had all the things I needed to function over a 2 week period. I booked a Tokyo Tower view room which was nice in the evenings when I was in the room. However the bar area on the 24th floor has such great views, I think I would save the money and spend it on a cocktail in the bar and enjoy the view from there. I note that a couple of reviewers have commented on the noise. I heard nothing at all. Perhaps I was higher up In terms of sleep, the bed was very comfortable, lighting was good both to work and relax and the bathroom clean and impressive. For those who have never been to Japan, make sure you press the correct buttons on the toilet seat to avoid surprises! The staff were great, the breakfast buffet was also great although, I did this only on weekends preferring to pick up a pastry and a coffee at the station on the way to my office a few metro stops from the hotel. The 24/7 Family Mart convenience store in the basement of the hotel is very useful and so you can stock your minibar with what you need and if you want a deep fried snack at 4 AM, you know where to get one. Tokyo is very safe and going to the store at 4 AM is not a problem! There are plenty of restaurants in the Shiodome area but if you take a walk beyond the station complex, you will be rewarded with real culinary treats. Make the journey As for departing to airports, Both Narita and Haneda are accessible via subway and Narita express a few minutes walk from the hotel and all under cover. If you wish to take a Limousine Bus then the Shiodome is a direct call hotel - but check the timetable with the concierge in reception and book tickets there.

I strongly encourage hiring a pocket WiFi, either ordering it on Internet before arriving (and companies usually send it to you to the hotel) or you can hire the service at the hotel's concierge.

We exchanged emails with the reservation team to make sure this was possible, and they confirmed they would arrange the limousine bus for us.On the day we arrived, it turned out they couldn't provide the bus service on time for us to catch our flight (we had clearly mentioned the time in our email). So instead of our anticipated relaxing last afternoon in Tokyo, we spent our time arguing with the staff, calculating how much their mis-communication would cost us in taxi, and finally trying to figure out alternatives for the next morning. Result: we had to wake up at 4am to make it on time to the airport. After a long discussion, the staff's superior authorised a meager discount to our room of 20,000 yen.

I just had to walk toward the 4/5 exit then turn right to pass thru the rotating door to reach the elevator that will take me to the lobby.I had absoultely zero idea that this hotel had such a great view. Upon arriving the lobby that is located on 25th floor, I was blown away with a beautiful view of the Tokyo Tower right behind the lobby counter.I was greeted by a Korean staff who also spoke English and Japanese pretty well. He was first trying to get me a room that has a view for the Tokyo Tower but then he said since we arrived quite late, all the Tokyo Tower view rooms were out. However, he said that he will offer to give us a higher room upgrade at a 50% discount if we wanted to upgrade.However, everything else was great. The room was clean, and the city view itself was great. We did see the Tokyo tower as a reflection off from the tall building standing.Bathroom was spacious, and the room was spacious unlike the typical Japanese business hotels.I didn't eat in the restaurant but I didn't like the idea of having restaurant so opened in the lobby. It didn't have any privacy to it. Wish it had a separate area for the people who are eating.Other good thing about this hotel is that almost everyone staying were foreigners all around the world (mostly from US). I myself is a foreigner from Canada and it was nice to connect with people from different countries.Also, the coincerge staffs were really helpful in providing the direction and reocmmendation to the restaurants.On my next trip to Tokyo, I am thinking of trying Vila Fontaine to compare the two.","Burnaby, Canada","F775PGsimons</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burnaby, Canada</strong>",48,4.0

It was very late since Haneda was closed due to an airliner fire and I had to scramble and catch one of the last trains from Osaka, so her encouragement meant a lot at that moment. Great first impression!I was given Room 3631, A “Tokyo Tower View” room with a double bed, and it delivered as promised, TT visible even from lying down in bed. Also in view was the Rainbow Bridge off in the distance, Hamamatsuchou Station closer in and the JR / Shinkansen and Yurikamome line tracks down below.The room was small for the price, standard perhaps for a business hotel costing 1/3 as much. But it was very well- appointed and the linens and such were top- drawer. The closet had generous hangers, good since there was barely any drawer space. For a one- night stay this was no issue, but if you were there with your partner for a week, you would soon start developing Cabin Fever. There are many new hotels challenging the space – price tradeoff, and RPH is going the wrong way in this regard. The A/C worked great. And the window did not exactly open, but there was an electronically- controlled vent for some fresh air, very welcome.The bathroom was a cross between Biz Hotel and Luxus. More to the former. The amenities were a bit upgraded from biz hotel standards.The breakfast is good, better than a biz hotel but still not up to the level that this hotel prices at. The view is great but nothing you don’t already have from your room. It’s a rather tight fit at the buffet, in fact – if the restaurant is fully- seated, I predict lines and outages.The location is excellent, great in fact. It’s a very short walk to the famous Ginza shopping district. The Shimbashi station is a 4 minute walk away and just beyond the Yamanote Line tracks, the entertainment district offers every kind of restaurant and bar. You can even get chicken sashimi (raw chicken) at one place which would be a health risk in most places but not here. Tokyo station is two stops on the Yamanote- sen, and the Yurikamome Line to Odaiba plus several Tokyo Metro stops are at nearby Shimbashi Station.There are many ways to get to this hotel, but even for many who know Tokyo well, this section can be confusing. The “No Fail” way to the hotel from Shimbashi Station is thus: follow the signs directing you to the Yurikamome Line. There are various paths, all well- marked and leading you to an above- ground structure set apart from JR Shimbashi Station and with three escalators, one up and two down. Go up this initial escalator and go onwards with the crowd. Once you pass the convenience store, skip the entrance to the Yurikamome Line and keep on in the same direction, keeping to the right. At the first chance to make a right turn, do so, onto a walkway which is 2/3 stone and 1/3 wood and between two tall buildings. Once you are on this walkway you should see, on your left and down one level, a rounded entranceway with big illuminated letters SHIODOME and small letters Royal Park Hotel. From your level there will be an obvious escalator down to get you to the lower level. The rest is easy, Oyasuminasai.",Munich,"MunichEricJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich</strong>",486,4.0

Hotel was also right next to a TV station so there were frequent celebrity sightings. About 3 minute walk to Shinbashi station. Room - we stayed in their junior suite as it was our first time traveling with our baby, we wanted more space to store our luggage and baby stroller. Room size was very decent by Japanese standards and it was about 2-3 times the size of an average room in Tokyo. The baby cot was provided as requested at no extra charge, and it was a very good quality one. It was placed right next to our bed and one side of the cot can be lowered down so I could sooth my little one during the night without getting out of bed. I liked the layout of the room as there were sliding doors on both side of the bedroom which made it easy to close off the sleeping area from the bathroom or the living room. The small bar area was a nice touch as there was a sink and microwave so I could easily prepare and wash my baby bottles there. Tip - if you find that your shopping goods could not fit into all your luggage, the hotel offers cardboard boxes (300 yen for their largest box) to pack up your things to ship them home by air. They will weigh everything at the lobby when you are ready and all you need to do is fill out your address for them. They will forward them to the shipping companies for you to save you the hassle. It was half the cost of what I would've paid for extra luggage at the airport and the boxes were delivered to us the very next day.

It seemed like a lot of business travelers, but still many vacationers at this hotel. Overall, the hotel and amenities exceeded my expectations, especially the size of the rooms. Generally, hotel rooms in Tokyo are very compact. These rooms are more reasonably sized. We booked a queen room and a king room for the 3 of us. I do not recommend more than 2 adults (and maybe one young child) in a queen room, unless you have no need for personal space. Plusses: Great air con in the rooms, very comfortable bed and pillows, small dorm type frig in the room for whatever, hot water pot for coffee/tea/soup, great room amenities (soap, shampoo and conditioner all on pump in the shower - good quality); comfortable room jammies but bottoms will not fit most western men; good shades against the early morning sun - like 5 am; Great breakfast buffet - mostly western, but includes rice/miso/pickles/salmon for a walk on the Japanese side; Great front desk and very good english skills; 5 min walk to Shimbashi Station where you can go almost anywhere - Yamanote, other JR lines, various subway lines). Lots of good restaurants nearby, look at the Caratta Building and the Shiodome City Center Building. In Japan, many restaurants are in office towers or department stores. Minuses: No mini bar or room service (but they have the small frig); Need to walk to a train station (Shimbashi).Other suggestions: Japanese retailers may not accept credit cards. Exchange some cash, but try to put as much as you can on your credit card to get the best exchange rate. Ask the hotel for a Tokyo Metro map and use this to get around.

Also a short walk to the Tsukiji (Tokyo) fish market.

Also a Starbucks and a Tullys coffee shop nearby (I prefer Tullys). My only complaint is that this hotel could be anywhere in the world and lacked the local eccentricities that I usually seek in a hotel while overseas. However - I guess this is the point of 5 star hotels!!

The hotel is well located and easy to find from the subway station. Also, the hotel is close to the Fish Market but unfortunately, the concierge had no knowledge of the name nor location of some of the better sushi restaurants located within the Fish Market. We referenced a certain establishment and even game the concierge the correct web site and were still miss directed. We had a room issue and asked to relocate to a less expensive room than booked and were refused. I guess the customer is not always right at this hotel. Lastly, this ""business"" hotel had no room nor computers to conduct business. In order to print our boarding passes we had to go to a nearby Kinko's, rent a computer and print our passes. We spent over $1,000 for rooms at the hotel but still had to shell out an additional $3.00 at Kinko's in order to obtain boarding passes. Maybe the Royal Park should spend less money on their silly toilets and offer a computer or two for their clients.

The hotel staff are very friendly and always ready to help with a smile. And our room came with a nice view of a garden and river / canal. We requested for a king bed but what we had looked even bigger. I think they pushed 2 super singles together to form the bed which was great for us as our toddler is co-sleeping with us, and that means more space for us! Only drawback is the room is really on the small side for a family. I had to strategize to fit our single big suitcase as well as the stroller in the room. The lack of wardrobe drawers also meant I had a bit of challenge unpacking our clothes. An added bonus was us locating a restaurant catering to vegans at level 1 - Chaya Macrobiotics. We were worried about not finding vegetarian food options around us and here is one right at our doorstep! And it was delicious too.

As you would expect in Japan, the rooms are kept very clean. As a hotel that caters to many visitors to Japan, there is rarely, if ever, any problem communicating with the lobby staff or concierge, as their English skills are quite good.This was our first stay since their room renovations. When we booked our rooms online at the hotel's website, we did not see, in the list of available rooms, the usual standard twin room that we booked many times in the past. Perhaps it was the time of year or the lead time for the booking (March 7th for an April 23-27 stay). The least expensive choice for two people was a ""Renovated Moderate Double"" with one queen bed. The bed was really too small for us and there was no way for one of us to turn at night without smacking the other. The room would have accommodated a wider bed, as there was at least several feet of space between the bed and the windows. Wifi reception was also not uniform within the room and at times dropped out entirely at the bed area. Besides being kept very clean, the rooms are also quiet. We never once heard any noise from other rooms or the corridors, despite having a room directly adjacent to the elevators.The location is quite good, being a very short walk to the Oedo Subway line Shiodome station (fast way to Shinjuku - 18 minutes, Roppongi - 9 minutes) and only a few minute longer walk to Shimbashi station. The walk is shielded from the weather for all but 100 feet. It's also a nice stroll to either Ginza or Tsukiji. The lobby is on the 24th floor, and the hotel has coin-operated washer/dryers on the 26th floor, which is very convenient.Prices vary during the week, so if you have the flexibility to do so, try to adjust your stay times to avoid the expensive weekend days.","Pleasanton, California","jeffandmandy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pleasanton, California</strong>",2,4.0

It was late when we arrived at Shiodome City Center, where the hotel was located. The shops around were closed. A porter was waiting at the ground floor to take us up to the 24th floor, the hotel lobby. After check in, we were assigned a small room in 27th floor. The room was so small, different from what we surfed in the internet. We went back to the lobby to complained and we were promised an upgraded room the next day, but on a higher price. Soon, after settling down our luggage, we went down to find a place to dine. It was good that a Chinese restaurant, right across the entrance of the hotel, was still open. Tired and hungry, we devoured every dish served to us. Back in the hotel, we found it difficult to sleep in a small bed. Added to that was being aware that the bathroom had no door, hence we could inhale almost anything coming from the bathroom. The next day, we were informed we could transfer to a bigger room at the 35th floor. it was a relief for us even though our transfer caused us a 30 minute delay of our city tour. From then on, everything was fine: from amenities to service.  The view from our room was fantastic. I could see the hazy Ferris wheel at distant Diver City. A little far down the 35th floor is a picturesque view of buildings along a body of water that also ran under a bridge. The reception area at the left side of the lobby had decoration on the glass wall which let the sunshine in and illuminated the whole lobby. On the left side was a wine bar. Adjacent was information counter where the helpful personnel provided advice on how to get to places and handed out free magazine and maps.

To be honest I didn't look into it as much as I did other hotels because I was fed up of trying to get it right for our first major holiday.......but boy was I lucky!Starting with the hotel and facilities... The hotel was immaculate and the staff were so helpful and attentive. The rooms were clean and provided everything you would need and more. Yes the rooms are a bit on the small side for the price however they are still spacious. The only problem we had was room to put our clothes. We kept everything in our cases and just took our cases out of the storage space each day to get our clothes out for the day, but this wasn't a hardship. The view from the room (Tokyo Tower Double Room) was amazing. The rainbow bridge to the west and the Tokyo tower to the east, and on a good day you can see Mt Fuji in the distance behind the tower. The bed was extremely comfortable as was the bedding.Unfortunately I can't comment on the food as we ate out. But I cannot fault anything that we experienced here.This hotel location was perfect for us. As first time visitors to Tokyo and Japan we wanted to experience the Japanese life but without being in a tourist trap. This hotel is based in the Shiodome building complex. In the basement of the hotel building there is a Family Mart convenience store and this is also access to the Shiodome subway station which takes you to nearly all of the popular tourist locations. The subway system is extremely easy to navigate around and if you do have any problems someone is always on hand to point you to the right line and platform.The location is just on the outskirts of the upmarket shopping district of Ginza, and Shinbashi. 5-10 minutes walking distance to each. Both locations have an abundance of restaurants that will cater for anybody. We read somewhere before we went, that if you wanted the best food, follow the Japanese businessmen and women. We did and the food was amazing. Two of the best nights we had were in Shinbashi (come out of the main hotel entrance where the taxi's are, turn right and right again, under the railway lines and turn right). Shinbashi is a maze of small Japanese streets full of bars and Restaurants. Everywhere we went people were very accommodating and helpful.I have read previous reviews for this hotel saying that it is out of the way of everything and a taxi ride or long walk away from things and there are no nice restaurants nearby. I can only assume these people have not explored the area properly. Yes it's quiet but 5 minutes walk and it's a hive of activity. The only time we took a taxi was arriving from Tokyo station with our suitcases and going back to Tokyo station to go home.AMAZING PLACE AND BEAUTIFUL HOTEL.P.S. The rooms are no smoking but there is a smoking booth in the main reception area. Which is that hi-tech we didn't know what it was at first as there is no smell of smoke at all...it is that hi-tech :-)","Northumberland, United Kingdom","Hels728</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northumberland, United Kingdom</strong>",4,5.0

We decided to splurge on the hotel and booked a king suite at the Royal Park Hotel The Shiodome; thanks to a multiple-night promotion we managed to save some as well. Our room was fantastic, with a separate sitting room and view of the Tokyo Tower. We may have taken pics of the bathroom for our fantasy remodel. We didn't take advantage of all the amenities, but we did eat in the Chinese restaurant, have a tea and cake set at the bar, and breakfast buffet (this last on our final day). All were delicious. We heard very little noise from our neighbors - but on occasion in the early mornings and late at night did hear the groans of the subway and rail lines, given the proximity to two major stations. Location-wise, Shiodome is more of a business area - you're across from most of the major broadcasters (and the amazing Hayao Miyazaki designed clock) - and is going to be lacking in step-out-the-door nightlife. Ginza's a short walk way for that. If you're an early bird or sushi lover, it's a short walk to Tsukiji Fish Market. The streets there can be a bit confusing to navigate, and the current construction going on doesn't help. Easier to navigate was the trains -- the Shiodome/Shimbashi subway and rail stations are connected to each other right next to the hotel via a basement-level open-air plaza, and many of the stations and surrounding buildings had eateries located inside, should you not want to venture very far. As a base for this trip, it was a great choice.","Los Angeles, California","Angela G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",1,5.0

Very easy walk from Shimbashi station. Little difficult to find that way, but keep checking the maps posted on the walls. The check in is on the 24th floor. I booked through Expedia and I'll likely post a similar review there. Staff is outstanding, facilities, location, everything is great. And they are the reason the hotel is rated so highly. Expedia indicated it was a 4 person room--there is no way this is accurate. When we arrived, we were shown to a room that had 2 beds that were each smaller than a US double, and larger than a twin. It was HORRIBLE. The hotel did contact me and tell me prior to arrival that I might be more comfortable in a larger room. None were available. They looked, I looked, regularly for a long time. I WISH the hotel had been more direct and told me that I should find another place to stay because we would not fit. I had actually cancelled a room at another hotel in favor of staying here. They said that it was a four person for people with kids--we were traveling with kids in elementary school. Again, I wish staff had been more direct and expedia NEVER should have had this listed as a 4 person room. NEVER. Anyone with kids knows that children are take-over-the-bed sleepers. The only scenario I'd see this working would be if you were co-sleeping with an infant. I went to the front desk in the middle of the night (I wasn't sleeping anyway, as I'd been kicked out of bed (physically kicked out by a sleeping child). The night manager, who was very sympathetic, upgraded us to the elusive sized room that hadn't been available. It was a beautiful room--and I was very appreciative. That said, the room still would have driven me crazy had not my husband slept on the super sized bed. It was basically two of the not-quite-a-double, but bigger-than-a-twin bed together and he had a child on either side. I got the twin sized sofa bed. Had the manager not found this room for us, we definitely would have checked out the next day and I would have been scrambling to find a new hotel. I would absolutely recommend this hotel, but if you are a family, please be certain you understand the bed type. This was our 4th hotel in Japan and EVERY SINGLE OTHER HOTEL had one bed per person--I loved it. Those beds were about the same size as the bed in our first night at this hotel.

I went end of Mar/early April, just got back, with a buddy/co-worker. We had business in Shanghai and stopped over in Tokyo for 3 nights on the way home. We were fortunate in using our company's hotel connections to score the 3 nights on a favorable cost, and were upgraded to a ""Junior Suite Twin Room"" on a corner of the 31st floor. Unreal location, having many huge windows for access to breathtaking views. I've read reviews on how small the rooms were, so if you need more space or have kids, man, I recommend upgrading to the junior suite. Tons of room. We are two big guys, had our bags splayed out all over, and still had tons of room, as the suite has a side couch/lounge area with a small writing desk, where you can really lay out your bags and gear. The bathroom was very spacious - ours had a glass encased walk-in shower with a tub in it. Never seen this style before, but it was great for two big guys, no issues with space in there, it was huge. (and no, not two guys at once, just meaning two taller guys not having to worry about small shower spaces, separately) The counter space was a bit small, and the lighted mirror tended to get pretty damn hot if left on for a while, so that heated up the room a bit, small downside to that model of lighted mirror. Toilet was in a separate little enclave, nice. Beds... maybe the only negative I can report on the place, but not enough to mark down a full star. The twin beds... are twins... like college dorm beds. TINY. And hard as a rock. Pretty much no mattress under there, must have been planks. For us guys over 6 feet, it was not fantastic sleeping by a stretch. The Marriott bed I had in Shanghai was similar, so I must now assume the Asian culture places zero value on beds and sleeping conditions. Strange. Hence no star markdown, as this does not appear isolated. Otherwise the unit had a big closet for nice clothes storage, a separate hutch with microwave, coffee maker, sink, etc. And the back of the dual bed unit had a nifty makeup counter with chair and fold-out mirror and light, perfect for the ladies. The built-in bed unit had lighting options, plugs for your cell cords, all very well thought out and innovative really. Very nice materials and placement of lights and cords. All the plugs in the room were for US, so you don't need any adapters at all. Location was great, in terms of being in a nice, clean, modern location. As many others noted, the general market downstairs is KEY to getting $1 liters of water and $2 beers and snacks for the room. No $10 water markups. So key to saving money while staying hydrated and having treats for the room. There is also a TACO BELL downstairs, yes a taco bell closer to my tokyo room than my american house, that also serves tap beer. My wife's dream scenario. Also a Tullys coffee shop next to that, great for morning breakfast and coffee before heading out for the day. Several other restaurant/bars downstairs, and in the adjacent Caretta building with steak houses and whatnot. Pls note they all close at 930-10pm though, even on weekeneds. We planned on a late dinner before hitting a club, and had to scramble when they were all closed. Weird for a big tourist town. The subway station is below the hotel as well, which is KEY. Several of the lines pass through there, and several others are just a couple blocks away. Makes it very easy to get to and from everywhere. Takes some time to learn the train maps and system, but once you do, it is pretty nifty. Just hard to tell where the hell the various enter and exit points are though. Sometimes the same station has 2 different entry points for 2 different lines that are 2 blocks away, seriously. Free wifi in rooms and lobby were good. Also free wifi outside downstairs at Tullys. Tons of free wifi around the city, at every train station, etc. Very impressive. Make the walk 2 blocks south east to the Hamarikyu Gardens, worth it. Apparently old fortress and property of royalty, very pretty. You can also walk to Ginza district and train system, which takes you to all the shopping and a lot of train line points. Not that far.

When arrive hotel building, take lift to reception at 24th floor, then separated lift will bring you to your room. Small size room (standard for japan) which just enough for me to put two large luggages on floor. The room we had was 29th floor renovated with stunning tower view, which i think is a must if you stay in this hotel. Nice comfort bed,high tech toilet seat, deep bath tub, you can buy some japanese bath powders and make it like a mini onsen. I found out that to reduce the outside noise (trains crossing, police sirens), turn off the fresh air ventilation at the window unit. Probably the ventilation is open up a valve to get fresh air from outside building, therefore can hear outside even at 29th floor.Below Hotel are restaurants, shops and trains (metro, subway, JR, monorail). There are all different companies running the public transport, its bit complicated, we got a 3 days unlimit subway metro card (1500 yen), enough to reach all the places around tokyo.Approx 10 mins walking distance to tsukiji fish market and Ginza.

Friendly staff. Good central location very close to Fish markets, Ginza and business district of Tokyo.

I've seen a few arrivals walking towards these lifts with ""what the heck?"" expression. Just be prepared and trust the bell boy! Rates are expensive but this is 4 star, center of Tokyo hotel - hence a ""very good"" overall rating. They could have reduced rates by $100USD/night less and Royal Park Hotel would be still expensive... There were groups of Russians staying at the time - you can tell the hotel is either good or expensive (or both) if you see them at the breakfast!Room was excellent and as with most Japanese hotels you have to run air purifier (provided) as well as air con to ensure quality air (otherwise ""funny smelling room"" might be in your own review). Bathroom to die for (i think i need to renovate my home after that one!!!). We've used Western Cuisine breakfast room - a bit small in space hence offered buffet selection was average (but on par with other 3 or 4 star hotels). Choosing windows with views is great idea until you realize the Sun shines and glass of your window is NOT heat resistant. Views are splendid though. So choose carefully! Tip: A taxi from Tokyo station was 1,350JPY (traffic) but a metro ticket would be 200JPY. That makes sense only if you can afford 15min of walking around trying to find your way from nearest metro station to the hotel.

I chose to stay at The Shiodome as Ginza was my only point of reference, knowing it wouldn't be the most picturesque of districts, but it turned out to be a right decision, at least for us. The Shiodome is a new development made mostly of high-rises, right on the SW tip of fancy Ginza. It is also walking distance from more reasonably-priced Shinbashi, packed with shops and restaurants.The hotel is built directly on top of the Shiodome metro station, which in turn is connected underground to the Shimbashi station (different public transport companies have each one their station and they connect -sometimes). So this makes it extremely easy to connect to the circular line, or any train or subway for that case, and you can walk to Ginza, Hamarikyu Gardens and the Fish Market (more on this in future posts).What this also means is that you can skip the hotel breakfast if you wish to, like we did, and instead have it at the station shops, where you can choose anything from fresh bakeries and coffee to authentic white-collar Japanese fare. A great way to push you to leave the hotel early and make better use of your time in the city.The hotel: again, in typical Tokyo style, it is built vertically, occupying the top floors of a high rise. This means that although the entrance is of course at street level, the lobby is on the 21st floor (my room was on the 38th). The hotel is really beautiful, nicely decorated in modern style, and every detail is taken care of. I booked a Superior twin room with an extra bed for my second child. Room sizes run of course on the small side (again, Japan), but this one would have been pretty comfortable when occupied by two people. Mattresses were of high quality, and when we requested allergy-free pillows we got top-of-the-line memory foam ones. Amenities included brand name beauty sets renewed every other day, toothbrushes, shaving machines, Japanese-style pajamas (you should try those) and a new set of slippers every day. The room had an ironing board and a wireless iron, a coffee machine, pretty good wifi (included) and perfect sound isolation. The view was nice, however surrounded by other high rises. The bathroom deserves a special paragraph. Not because of the beautiful fixtures and comfortable shower and separate tub, but because of the toilet (commode, water-closet).Japan is world-famous for its bidets, and we enjoyed a 10-thousand dollar commode with bidet that I will probably miss for the rest of my life. Among other features, it opened and lit up when entering the bathroom stall, the seat was always warm, and after doing your thing, you could choose among bidet, massage, water orientation and yes... airflow to dry your butt and give it that finishing touch! Could anyone ask for anything else, I mean, anything? The hotel offers coin-op laundry on one of the top floors, so you can travel light, even in winter and with children, and always count on fresh clothes to wear. There is a smoking room right next to the laundry, that is not precisely the smartest location, but at least it is contained to one section of the hotel only (there is a smoking ""closet"" next to one of the restaurants, basically a small room with ventilation, another Japanese wonder).Service is extremely polite (did I mention this was Japan?) and the Concierge will give you good information on dining out around the area (try any of the small authentic Shimbashi places across the railroad track, 300 meters away, including a stand-up sushi). There is a gym (no pool), which I never used. There is also a very convenient Seven Eleven right on the basement. The only bad thing I have to say about this hotel is in regards to their payment policy. I booked through Booking.com and gave them my credit card on check-in as a guarantee. One would expect to pay the bill either in advance (i.e. when booking a special price), or at the end of the stay (the usual way). However, half-way through my stay, I got a call in the middle of the night by an anxious employee who demanded I went downstairs and pay the bill in full because ""it was getting too high"". We had not used the phone or minibar, only the room, so I was intrigued. I told them I would take care of it the next morning.Indeed, the following morning I approached the front desk and asked them what the problem was, as they had my credit card as a guarantee (for a total of 2100 dollars for the full stay, which is not that much), but they insisted I pay in full (with that same credit card!). I thought it was both awkward and offensive, I felt I was being under suspicion or something, but signed the check so they would relax. When I wrote to the management demanding an explanation for this, their answer was that this payment policy was stated somewhere in small print and posted on one of the room walls -whatever. Other than that, I would strongly recommend it, especially if you are a couple or business traveller. There are probably more exciting neighborhoods in Tokyo, but this one is a wonderful choice as well.","New York City, New York","Disfrutator</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",115,5.0

The room we selected was perhaps a touch small (with only a double bed), so I would suggest checking the room and bed size if you like your space! There's something lovely about staying in a hotel that is part of a larger building - which is what you will get with the Shiodome as the lobby is on the 24th floor and the rest of the hotel floors are above it. The staff and concierge were really helpful and we definitely took the opportunity to ask them to help with external calls that required Japanese (e.g. calling a place that I wasn't sure was still operating) and also tips on Tokyo (e.g. we got some good tips on new years eve). My two favourite things about the hotel are: (1) the Bar! It was lovely to stop by and have a quick drink at the bar with the beautiful 24th floor views. (2) The location - the hotel is barely about a 4 minute (mostly undercover) walk from the train stations (Both JR and subway) so it is SO easy to get around. We could easily stop back at hotel between morning/afternoon touring for a short rest before heading out at night. The Family Mart at the base of the hotel's building is also really handy.

You can walk to Ginza (10 mins), Hama Rikyu garden (10 mins – highly recommended! Beautiful garden) and Tsukiji Fish Market (20-25mins walk). There are many train lines near this hotel therefore, you definitely can use this hotel as a base in Tokyo to travel around Tokyo or day trips to outskirt. You can take the JR Tokaido line to Yokohama for a day trip, Yurikamome line to Odaiba for a day trip, Oedo Line to Shinjuku, Asakusa line to Asakusa / Skytree, Ginza line to Ueno or Shibuya, etc. -There are many restaurants nearby from Japanese, to Korean, to fast food (McDonalds) and even a Starbucks along with a few others coffee place. There is also a 24 convenient shop that you can buy beers, local snacks, bread and water (Hotel is stingy with it)- Amazing view of Hama Rikyu garden and CBD area from the hotel room. - Free wifi in room and lobby so it’s excellent.- Airport Express (bus) from Narita/Haneda airport directly to the hotel and return. Very convenient. You can purchase the ticket at the airport and to get back to the hotel, you can purchase the ticket at the hotel. Note: To check the timing as the airport transfer is not frequent. Alternatively, take the train, directly to/from Haneda airport.- Storage of luggage. We made a 4 days trip to Nikko (out skirt of Tokyo) and didn’t want to lug along our luggage. The hotel allowed us to leave it with them until we got back to Tokyo to check in to the hotel again. - This hotel has a launderette, so it is very useful if you have a long stay in JP. Thumbs up for this. Note: There are 8 washing/drying machine, however, the drying machine doesnt dry your clothes easily, therefore we did it for 90 mins and even then, some of the clothes are wet. Cons- The check in/check out staffs was not the usual Japanese standard that I had experienced. They were not really helpful and look irritated when you ask them questions. - Limited 2 bottles of water per day. Don’t understand why, but thankfully water is cheap in Japan- Room is clean but basic and definitely need upgrade.Would I stay here again?

Global Blue tax refund is located in each department store and money is given back in yen.The concierge was wonderful in helping us with restaurant reservations and spa appointments in the hotel. There is a 10% discount at the spa if you are a hotel guest. Several days before our departure, the concierge made reservations for the airport limo bus.

Two train stations located at basement as well as a Family Mart which makes getting late night snacks and drinks very easy! (Bonus: the FamilyMart will microwave any hot foods that you purchase like Udon) We stayed in an renovated twin room and the two beds were situated together. The four of us were snug, but it worked. The hotel was proactive in advising us that the room maxes at 2 adults and 2 small children (beds are 110cm wide). For Tokyo standards, I believe this is an average size room.

It was the second stay for me. First, this is a great choice if you are a foodie or need help with booking restaurants – we made complicated requests to and fro by emails to the hotel 2-3 months before our stay and the guest relations department responded so quickly each time that we were shocked – replies came within a day and sometimes within an hour! We have never encountered such good and quick concierge service before from other top hotels. And each time it's by a different staff so obviously they keep track of our requests and internal coordination is very good. While we chose most of the restaurants ourselves, the hotel made two good recommendations (Toku-uychiyama and Washoku En). When I caught a cold and wanted to see a doctor on a Saturday afternoon when clinics were closed, they were able to advise me on which English speaking hospital to go to and the payment policies, and even gave me a brochure of that hospital. Second, it's in a great location with easy access to 5 train lines at basement 2 that can take you anywhere in Tokyo. (Get a stored value Pasmo card from the ticket machines to save time figuring out fares and buying tickets every time). The two stations are Shimbashi and Shiodome. There are many eateries, cafes and a 24hour family mart in B2, as well as good restaurants on the top floors and basements of two nearby tall buildings, Shiodome City Center and Caretta Shiodome, all connected at B2. Two good restaurants there are Tsunahachi tempura (same as the famous one in Shinjuku, but less crowded here) and Washoku En Shiodome. There was a magical Christmas light and music show at the Caretta basement level every hour in the evening. And from the hotel to Haneda airport is a direct 25 minute train on the Asakusa Line. Third, the hotel and its restaurants are top notch in quality and service. I had a 26 Sqm standard double room with views over the river and park, comfortable bed and pillows, powerful shower, good free wifi and all amenities provided. The bar on 24th floor (same as reception) is welcoming especially at night with the views. All the rooms are on floors 25 to 38. There is an adequate gym in B2 next to the spa which my friends used. This is a hotel I would come back to without reservations. ","Singapore, Singapore","UWA_Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",109,5.0

I chose RPH because it had washing machine/dryer available for guests...(and they worked perfectly for a small fee..)As RPH was not exactly an international chain, I visited the hotel with little expectations. It came away much better than expected, well almost...  It was crowded when I checked in. There was service, smile but it was simply busy. Staff spoke English. I booked a superior twin and 2 standard twin rooms. The superior twin room took my breath away, It was huge for a city hotel. A sofa bed was converted nicely into a bed for my sons. It looked modern, clean and pleasing. The dressing room was huge, the bath lovely and the WC modern. The views were limited. Mostly office towers and you could see people working, having meetings and smoking in the smoking rooms. It was that close. There was the JR station, railway tracks and glimpses of Tokyo. Not much of a view but the hotel was on the higher end of the office tower, so the elevated views compensated somewhat. I realized there was cigarette smell in my WC room when checking in. I informed the bell-boy who was with me then. The front desk called me within 10 mins, offered their sincere apologies and offered me 2 choices. Firstly, an upgrade to a junior suite with King bed (my requirement) but only available after 6pm. Or an immediate move to a junior suite with twin beds. I declined both as I had unpacked some of my stuff. Full marks for customer service. No denying, no lame excuses, they handled it beautifully and head-on. Well done! The housekeeper came and spray deodorant to clear the smell. It worked somewhat but the smell came back. I realized it was the WC ventilation that brought the smell in. However the rest of my bath and dressing room (or room for that matter) were not affected. (Upon checking out, the front desk continued to apologies profusely for the smell. They did not forget! Again kudos for such sincere level of service) The standard twin rooms that I had for other family members were much smaller in size. But they had better views of Tokyo. Stable wifi was available in the room.Underground parking was available. But it was a busy one via storage system.Breakfast spread was decent but somewhat limited in spread. The cafe was a bit small though. There was a mall and restaurants in the immediate vicinity. But you would have to travel out if you want to see more. Overall RPH was a surprise gem for me. Their level of service would put some international brands to shame. Would have been 5 stars if not for the smell in my WC room.

We liked the laundry facilities, the bathroom amenities (even face cleanser provided), complimentary water, ice dispensing machine on every floor were some of the minor details we appreciated. My girl was made to feel included when we happily found out that the hotel provided child sized bedroom slippers for my tween aged child (although it was more for a 5 year old) and an attractive set of children's toothbrush. The space for bath tub was well thought of with shower holder on both lower and higher rungs. The heated toilet seats are a blessing. Room temperature was always comfortable. Family mart just downstairs.My 1 quip would be that I wished concierge could speak some English. Due to some error in communication translating between myself and the Disneyland customer helpline (which unfortunately is only available in Japanese), I had to pay some fee which initially I understood (from the hotel staff) as no fee necessary. The amount was small but if it was a big amount, I would have complained directly to the hotel. So be careful there if you need some translation services, please ensure that the translator is fully conversant in both languages.Having said that, we still thank Royal Park Hotel the Shiodome for prividing us with an interesting start to our Japan adventure.","Singapore, Singapore","maywgk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",45,4.0

Needed a place to stay for our first night in Tokyo. This was a convenient location and essentially right next to the metro- so easy to get to with our bags and kids in tow.We didn't stay long - only an evening after midnight arrival . Check in was fast and easy, nice front desk staff. They upgraded our room. Was twin beds with a sofa bed. Beds are small by US standards, but we could squeeze an adult and a child on each bed.Bathroom we had was huge. My favorite part of the room. Big open space - a bench to sit on with a long mirror and plenty of counter space. Toilet had a separate door and bath/ shower area was separate. First hotel bathroom I've had with a large window. You can close the shade- but open to do makeup and hair with natural sunlight . Loved that. Toilet had all the bells and whistles - warmer, washer etc.Plenty of little amenities like shavers, toothbrushes etc. large sized Shiseido shampoo and conditioner and bath gel( too bad they had to stay there). Room was clean. Towels weren't plush, but I'm finding that is the case around Japan.Also, you may need to request extra pillows as the pillows were a bit thin too. I would have liked an extra one , but we were too tired to bother asking. We had breakfast included with the room. They have three restaurants to choose from. My husband tried the Chinese breakfast and didn't really enjoy it. We were too late for the Japanese restaurant. I tried the Harmony restaurant buffet. Seems to be quite popular , as I had to wait in line for 10 minutes. Standard western options ( cereal, breads, eggs on order, fruit , salad items) and some Japanese items, like smoked salmon and pickled vegetables. It was good.There is a Family Market outside around the corner - that's where we picked up some things to eat at midnight and after checkout. Nothing seemed to be in English- we took our chances and tried a few things.We hopped on the metro and went to Tokyo station- which is two stops away to catch a bullet train to Nagano . It was a convenient location. If we had been there any other day we could have toured the fish market, which is very close by and is supposed to be a Must see. Unfortunately, we were there on a Sunday when it was closed.Bags can be kept at the metro station in lockers or there is a bag keep service at Tokyo station, as well. Handy if you have a few hours before your train. Just remember to keep your bags small and travel light. So much easier when traveling with kids and using public transportation.","Burke, Virginia","Familiafour</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burke, Virginia</strong>",33,4.0

Even though no cot was provided, we were quite comfortable with our toddler between us. No one fell off the bed.

Since my Japanese is terrible, I can't fault them exactly for this, but I was frustrated and disappointed by my inability to communicate with the staff. I had to rely on my business contacts in Tokyo to do so for me. I also had to change rooms twice. The first room was one of the ""not updated"" rooms and it was small, dingy and depressing. The next room was very smoky even though the hotel is non-smoking in its rooms. (It has a smoking lounge on at least one of the residential floors so beware!!!

Factor in that this hotel is considerably less expensive and you truly are receiving a great value. The room was extremely comfortable and the only things that I noticed that were cosmetic in nature were small puncture holes on the side of the desk chair and some stains on the carpet. Given that it took me until the 5th night to really notice these details, I hardly think one could fault the hotel for showing a little wear and tear. Location is perfect! Subways and JR lines all within a short 5-minute walk from the hotel. Having planned this in advance, we strategically used this hotel as a base on days where we would take the Shinkansen and overnight in other locations.

A colleague recommended the Royal Park Shiodome and it worked out very well indeed. We had each booked a renovated King room and it was very nice. Decent size if not huge and beautifully appointed and decorated. Another colleague of ours had booked a non-renovated room and mentioned that it was small and a bit cramped so that is maybe one consideration to take but the renovated rooms were superb.The hotel has its reception which is fast and efficient on Floor 24 - we arrived quite late and the only restaurant open was the Chinese themed one and it was very good indeed, food was excellent and staff very efficient.Check-in was quick and straightforward with rooms on 31/32 floors - they are renovating floors 35 and 36 just now so both these floors are closed.The next morning the main breakfast room was good with a large hot and cold buffet (both Asian and Western style) and also chefs cooking omelettes to order but that restaurant was busy in the morning and got very cramped with the large numbers of people having breakfast.Overall the hotel was very good with super staff and friendly fast service.There are plenty of restaurants close by the hotel and always taxis at the front door ( which reassuringly is on Floor 1)The hotel sits midway between two light rail stations Shiodome and Shimbashi and it is as easy to walk to one as the other if you are using the light rail out to Toyusa. Shimbashi is a main station for the Tokyo metro with several lines converging there and it is approximately a 2 minute walk from the hotel in to Shimbashi station.The main shopping streets of Ginza are about 10 minutes easy stroll away so again location is first class.All in all a great hotel in a great location with friendly helpful staff - not a bad package at all.","Glasgow, United Kingdom","sweetville</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",64,5.0

I could see the folks in their offices working so for privacy I did need to lower the shades. Other sides of the hotel have great views including the fish market. You can walk to the fish market easily in case you want to get up and go over to see the tuna auction (need to go around 3am for a ticket I hear). The staff was very friendly and welcoming. The breakfast buffet was generous and tasty with many options. There are also other restaurants in the hotel and many more within minutes walking distance.

Don't think you will find food around the area at night like you would in Shinjuku or Shibuya, Ginza, etc as there are just grey buildings around. We had to dine at the hotel bar at 11pm which was costly plus the taxi fare before. Hmm not a good start. Tsukji was also not that close for walking despite what others say. Maybe not in summer anyway. The hotel is next to a mall (closed already of course when we arrived) and Shinbashi station can be accessed from the hotel basement. Hotel room itself is fine, larger than usual when you book a corner twin room. They said we have a city view, yes but in between buildings.

Hotel sits right on top of Shimbashi station which gives you instant access to major subway and train lines, JR Yamanote and Keisei being the most important ones. Keisei limited express, which goes from Haneda to Narita, gets you to Narita airport in 70minutes for around 1000Y, a third of what you pay for limousine bus which takes 90-120 minutes for same distance! We were able to go to Imperial palace, come back to hotel for quick break, then go to West to visit famed Meiji Jingu shinto shrine, come back to hotel for another break, then go East to see Sensoji buddhist temple and old Nakamise shopping street in Asakusa, back to hotel for another break and out for walk to Ginza main street (luxury shops); all in one day! All thanks to perfect location. Tsukiji market is also within easy walking distance; I went there in the morning, before we went to Imperial Palace.Shopping mall is virtually meters away from hotel. Food shops/bars open all day. You can buy anything you need for the fraction of price you pay at the hotel. Room is immaculate. Even had massage chair in it. View wasn't the best.Friendly staff. Very helpful (and patient) info desk.The only thing that we did not like is very expensive food and drink at the hotel. Me and my wife had a espresso coffee at the bar. My God!, all three of us, could have a feast for that money across the yard at Shiodome mall.Would definitively come again.

The staffs were more than helpful and friendly. Bed was comfortable which is what you need after a long day discovering this awesome city, the only thing if I'm being super picky is the the bathroom is a bit generic, but it's still clean and comes with all the amenities. The hotel is in the prime location and one of my personal favorite ward in the city, it is in walking distance to Shinbashi which being a office district, comes with many great izakaya for your liking, Shiodome itself also has some fancier option of western cuisine, and it is not far from Odaiba, which in my opinion is one of the better spot to shop and enjoy a great skyline view of the City.

The shuttle drops people off at several hotels along the way but the hotels are few and close by, so it is not a very long ride at all. We did not know about this service until we made inquiries at Narita Airport and it was simply purchasing a shuttle ticket. Shuttle is just outside the doors and easily spotted. The hotel lobby is on the upper floor, can't recall which, but is is not on the ground floor . . . 5th floor ? Signs will guide you. Just keep in mind that this is a Media Tower and the Hotel appears to be a small portion of the building. The Lobby is very well appointed, has a bar and restaurant. The Check-In staff spoke english very well. When asked, the staff was also very helpful in giving us great advice on places to eat. Our favorite place came to be YOSHINOYA's with a simple and very nice breakfast for 280 JPY and if you wanted side dishes, as we did 200 JPY for salmon. We will be forever thankful for that recommendation. The Hotel was well located and a short walk to Tsukiji Market . . . although we did take a cab early one morning for the Fish Auction (which had been held at 3:00 am that day, instead of the advertised 5:00 am) which we missed. The sushi bars adjacent to the Market was Outstanding ! ! ! The views from our rooms were great and overlooked a portion of the river. The Train Station was a very short distance from the hotel.

I already had my return train ticket in hand. After the cab had been going for some time I became increasingly concerned that the driver had headed out of the City on an expressway. I asked him where he was going, but as he spoke no English, it was very hard to converse. After a harrowing few minutes I began to understand that he had been instructed to drive me to Narita - a trip of over 60 kilometers. Because he had no English, I couldn't discuss with him and by then it was too late to turn back as I would have missed my designated train. I ended up having to pay a whopping $228 taxi fare, plus the cost of my unusable return train ticket, because of the hotel's mistake.

Location is perfect for tourists as it is within a short walking distance of (i) Ginza - for restaurants and shopping; (ii) Tsukiji fish market - for fresh sushi, tuna auction, etc.; (iii) Shimbashi station - which is close to a lot of izakayas, on the Yurikamome line, two stops from Tokyo Station which provides easy access to many other parts of Tokyo, on the Ginza line which is a direct line to Shibuya and Omotesando, etc. 2. Despite the location, the hotel is very quiet and has sufficient space around it - it gives the feel of a quiet oasis in the middle of a bustling city (although in the quiet, one can hear the soft rumble from some of the passing trains, occasionally). I stayed in a room with a view of the Tokyo tower and it was also very cool watching the trains pass by on the tracks.3. The cleanliness of the room was top-notch and housekeeping was excellent. Beds were comfortable, towels fresh, the hotel is probably relatively new and everything was spotlessly clean. 4.

Covered underpass from the hotel to Tokyo Metro and JR line. Came here direct from Haneda on Keikyu line and the train became a local train straight to Shimbashi station. No transfer needed.Pros:1) Location, location, location. Short walk to Tokyo Metro and Ginza just a station away.2) beautiful room with nice sitting area. Room was larger than I thought, definitely bigger than many hotels in Tokyo. Did the check-in staff said my room was upgraded? I did not completely understand everything she said, a little lost in translation. Sorry.3) Nice view. Can see part of Hama-rikyu Garden and a part of the bay.4) Staffs are friendly in general. Cons: (from the most annoying to least)1) Light switches- absolutely drives me crazy. I don't understand why can't I turn on some lights but not the rest. Lights are turned on from bathroom to the bedroom when keycard was inserted on the wall. There is no way for me to just turn on the bathroom light only. Still could not figure out how to turn on the table lamp next to the bed. I had to use a battery operated candle (found in the room) to make my way in the dark at night. 2) AC/ air conditioning. AC doesn't seem to work when I put the room at 24C or 25C, only appeared running at 20C. In general, I don't feel hot easily but rather scared of cold. Felt too warm in the room, had to put the room at 20C and I ended up freezing. 3) Bed. Way too soft, doesn't offer much support. Woke up in the middle of the night. Did not sleep well at all.4) Not enough electrical outlets. Surprise this is a hotel catered to business travelers. Don't the guests here need to charge their phones and tablets?5) Room as a whole suffers from identity crisis. Contemporary design but with white desk and cabinets with flowers? 6) Checked in staff did not ask if I needed help with my suitcase. That's a basic question.As a whole, this is a great hotel for its price point. Its location is definitely a winning factor. If the above issues can be addressed, the hotel can definitely be better and even be amazing. ","Atlanta, Georgia","terri3324</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",0,4.0

Although I had discussed & confirmed a rate for our extra nights' stay with the reservation office I was sent an email with a different rate & I had no choice but to pay that as I had no proof of my conversation with the reservations team.Breakfast is decent but only just. Vegetarian options are very limited & it closes at 10 am. So even if one makes it for breakfast at 930 am the staff constantly shows you the watch & tells you the closing time. They display a literal hurry to slam the door on you whilst you are eating (even if it is way before the closing time) & this didn't come across as courteous. I did bring this up to the Front Office Manager but there was no improvement.Overall its a well located hotel & its worth staying here but only up to a price point.

I did a lot of homework on prices before booking this hotel, the prices on the various sites (orbitz, expedia, etc) were all much more expensive than booking with the hotel directly, plus I really liked that the hotel's site was much more informative about the room types than the generic (and incorrect) descriptions on the travel sites. So the main things I looked into when considering a hotel? 1.) Location: From home (using Google Maps extensively) it seemed like a good choice because it was centrally located to all the sights we wanted to go to. 2.) Price: Again, from home this seemed like an average hotel so the price was good. Tokyo is pretty much just like Miami or NYC or LA or any large metropolitan city- the hotel prices can be super cheap for something just above couch surfing or they can be several thousands of dollars. 3.) Looks: I really really dislike that Victorian style of décor (imagine a 17th century French chateau) that so many 5 star hotels love (an obvious exception is Steampunk lol). Luckily, the style of this hotel is very modern.What was it actually like when I got there?1.) Location: Once we got there we realized that it was WAY more convenient than I could have imagined. The building is basically attached to 2 stations (Shiodome and Shinbashi), as well as another building (Caretta Shiodome) with various types of restaurants. Just an aside for the Caretta building it's got different types of cuisine and all types of price ranges (some of them even advertise English menus), they also have a Starbucks and a 7-11. The 7-11 we visited daily as the bottled water was super cheap and they have an ATM that accepts international cards (really difficult to find in Tokyo). We decided to see Tokyo Disney Sea, but be warned that you have to print out your ticket before you go there, they won't accept an electronic copy on your phone. Luckily there's a 24hr Kinko's immediately to your right when you exit the hotel from B2. There's also a 24hr Family Mart which is good if you come back late or leave super early, but be warned their ATM doesn't always work with international cards. If you are a person that snacks all day, those 7-11 rice balls are seriously addictive- consider yourselves warned lol. So to recap, being attached to 2 stations is very convenient, having 24 hour print and convenience store facilities is great, and having an entire building full of restaurants close by is even better.2.) Price: No surprises here, what’s advertised is what you pay- I loved this about Japan in general.3.) Looks: The hotel was nice and modern, as expected. Everything was clean and smelled good. The room and bed were both comfy. The only odd thing (it was more of a funny surprise) was that when you first come into the room, the toilet seat warmer turned on. If you weren’t mindful to turn it off when you first come in, you get a funny surprise when you go to the toilet and realize the seat is toasty- it always caught me and made my laugh at my own surprise lol. A note about the service and the staff:The staff was the best, they were so friendly and so helpful. I emailed them about 2 or 3 months before we arrived to ask about the electricity situation, and they said they had US power outlets on the desk in the room but the current was different. This wasn’t a problem but I asked if a power converter was available just in case, they said that I could request one by calling the front desk the day we arrive. But when we got into the room, the converter was already there waiting for us- I had forgotten that I’d even emailed them about it until I saw it sitting on the desk. When we first got there we were a little lost on a few things (like what the prices and schedules were like for single acts at Kabuki-za theater, or what exactly was the difference between a Pasmo and Suica cards for the transit system, etc), the help desk was super efficient (I don’t think I ever waited in line to be helped) and they knew their stuff well. On a different occasion I was confused about how to use the washing machine (where to put which liquids) and the guy wasn’t sure how to say “fabric softener” in English so he looked up pics on Google Images to show me (which was very appreciated) and then walked me upstairs to the laundry room to basically help me set up my first load of clothes (this was at like 11.30 at night) to make sure I didn’t make any mistakes. My friend bought a Japanese SIM and installed it on his phone at the front desk and in the process lost his US SIM card. When he discovered that it was missing we asked the front desk if they had seen it or if anyone had reported it, and you’d think I lost my child or something the way they rushed around and searched and called around the entire hotel asking various employees if they’d seen it. The staff here just went way out of their way to help you, the level of service was above and beyond anything I’ve ever experienced in all my travels. In short, I loved my stay at this hotel. It was clean and comfortable, the price was very nice, but seriously the best part of this hotel was the location and the staff. My next visit to Tokyo, I’ll definitely be coming back here.","Miami, Florida","Rafael A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",14,5.0

We like its proximity to the Tjukiji area because we would often go there for a good brunch of fresh seafood followed by various Japanese snacks.

The Shiodome Station also is right next to the Shimbashi Station, so it was very easy to get around Tokyo from the hotel.We dropped off our bags and were able to check in a few hours later. We had no problem finding things to do, as there were plenty of shops and restaurants very close to the hotel.Our room was wonderful. We booked the Superior Twin room, which had two beds and a pull out couch. Two of our bags were lost at LAX, but the hotel provided all amenities we needed until they arrived, including pajamas. They provided coffee and tea and all bathroom amenities. We had a great view of Tokyo, and the hotel was a nice walk away from several sightseeing locations (Hibiya Park, the Imperial Palace, and the Ginza area).

The lobby is on 24F and the rooms start from 26F and up to 38F. Our room was on the 36th floor and we'd a great view of Tokyo tower and the world below for our 4 day stop over. Heading out, the walk into Ginza is only a few minutes away, where there's a vast selection of shops and restaurants. Our room was comfortable and quiet with good facilities. Being 36 floors up, some exterior noise was barely noticable, but wasn't in any way annoying or disturbing. There was a minor 4.6 earthquake while we were there and the world did not end. The only downside, from my point of view, was the hotel's ""Happy Hour"" in the bar between 1730 - 1930 where there are a list of beers and cocktails available in the hotel bar for around 650 yen each. We headed down for a few Kirin beers (which were available on the happy hour list) but were surprised and more than a bit annoyed when the bill for 9 half-pints of Kirin Lager came to 12,830 yen. That was basically $100 for 4 and a half pints of beer which was more than a bit steep. I queried the charge at the time, and the bar staff replied that even though Kirin is on the Happy Hour, that's the bottled Kirin, and we were served 'draft' Kirin, which was the full price. Very disappointing to be caught out like this. Something to keep in mind if you're going to be in the bar.",Ireland,"Anthony C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ireland</strong>",50,3.0

Another aspect of the room which i liked was that there was a separate shower area, on top of the usual bathtub. the interior was quite tastefully appointed - a rather modern style with bold colours. I also like the floor to ceiling glass windows. The bed was very comfy and personally, I had no problems falling asleep. It wasn't too soft or hard. But then again, this is totally subjective/relative for every person, a bit like how one likes one's eggs done lol.Housekeeping was EXCELLENT. They did a great job of cleaning the room every day - I stayed for 5 nights. I absent-mindedly left something in the room when i checked out and they very kindly kept it for me! Oh, and there's also a Family Mart right in the basement of the hotel (B2) and I got my fruit, yogurt, water etc from it every day. The basement also connects directly to the Shinbashi and Shiodome stations. Commuting was convenient and fuss-free. I went to Teuchisoba Narutomi just one stop away at Tsukijicho station for soba. Tiny shop featured in a Japan Times article I read online (you can google it). Pretty good soba. Ginza station is also nearby.All in all, it was a really pleasant stay and I would recommend this hotel as a fairly reasonably-priced accommodation option as the more luxe ones tend to be astronomically-priced while the cheaper ones tend to be teeny in size with an even teenier bathroom.",,Pearl l,2,5.0

But it was just a little bit sterile. I was having breakfast in the Gaijin (western-style) restaurant when the earthquake hit - a magnitude of 6.something, so mid-level for Tokyo but certainly a surprise for me. It felt like someone had banged - hard - into the back of my chair. I spun round ... and realized. By Tokyo standards this was nothing too major - and the city is certainly well prepared for this. I looked down at the street and traffic was still moving. Godzilla was nowhere in sight. Back to the hotel. Ask for an omelette and watch the chefs flip them using chopsticks ... The rooms are amazingly clean. I once returned to my room while the cleaning lady was in there - they leave no blanket unturned, I can tell you. Rooms are a little small, but that's Tokyo for you. The staff are very friendly and helpful. The location is great for exploring Ginza and close enough, but not too close, to the fish market. There's an excellent trad Japanese restaurant one floor up from reception - 25th? Mind you, make sure you ask for the non-smoking area. The same applies to your room unless you're a smoker. The same building houses the offices of the make-up company Shiseido, so make sure you check the mirror before heading down to breakfast.

In fact, everyone was charming and helpful.

The hotel also does not provide body lotion (something I noticed in the other hotel I stayed at too. Not sure if this is a normal practice for Tokyo hotels). Breakfast - 5 out of 5. You can opt to have breakfast at one of 3 dining areas (international buffet, Chinese restaurant, Japanese restaurant). I checked out the International buffet and the Japanese restaurant. The international buffet section is a bit small (and always crowded), but the variety and quality of food was good. However, I highly recommend the Japanese restaurant. You get to choose from 2 traditional Japanese breakfast sets, with unlimited rice / congee and coffee / tea. I don't think many guests opt for Japanese breakfast, so the restaurant was almost deserted when I went there at 9am. I chose a seat with a fantastic view of Tokyo tower.

For a trip like this I would usually stay at Villa Fontaine Shiodome in one of their premier rooms (note to self, need to write review) but on this occasion they were all booked out so I had to look for alternatives. I like Shiodome area as its so convenient like many of the reviewers mentioned. I had stayed before in the Park Hotel (same area and can be confusing) but was not particularly impressed by the room or breakfast, Intercontinental Tokyo Bay which I like very much was too pricey and RPH had a reasonable (by Tokyo standards) discount rate promotion so I jumped in even though the discount was almost double the usual rate at Vila Fontaine. I arrived early but was informed that Housekeeping doesn't start until 10AM. I had scored a business class upgrade on the way to Tokyo and wasn't feeling too zonked out so I checked my bag with the Concierge and went out to my AM business meetings returning just after 1pm and the room was prepared. I was staying in a Standard Double, next step up from Economy Double so it was typically ""compact"" with a separate bath in the bath/shower enclosure (website explains better). First thing I did was turn off the heating as it was too hot, and opened up the electrically operated outside ventilation louvres so even though there was a little of the city sounds intruding there was plenty of fresh air and the room was still being heated by the rooms above beneath and to the side so now it was pleasant for me. My room was on L26 but since reception is on L24 and rooms go up to 38 I was essentially on one of the lower room floors but my view was very nice as it overlooked the hama-rikyu gardens.Breakfast buffet is OK but there is only one coffee machine, need at least one more. Internet was good 35mb/s up 20 down and 14ms ping although it did require a reconnect from time to time. The 10AM start for housekeeping became an issue again when I awoke one morning to find my room toilet blocked up (for no apparent reason!) and was told this would be attended to after 10AM. With so many places to eat within walking distance I did not eat much apart form Breakfast in the hotel but the snacks and small dishes available at the bar were qood quality as I can attest when I returned on Friday night to find a jazz trio laying out some smoooooth tunes in the main bar so I stopped for a nightcap and ""supper"" before heading to the comfortable bed. All the staff were professional with good english but I guess I am left feeling that for the price (which was heavily discounted) I expected more. Really I would rate it between average and very good but there is not this facility on Trip Advisor. I think a 10 step rating would be better.","Mount Dandenong, Australia","injasantravelman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mount Dandenong, Australia</strong>",18,3.0

Laundry service (if you need it) is quick, and if you plan ahead can be turned around in 12 hours. Food: Did not eat at the hotel restaurant, but the atmosphere and views looked inviting if I had been up for it. Location/Accessibility: Good. Walking distance to the Ginza (which I did several times). Also walking distance to both Shiodome metro and Shimbashi stations. There is always a cab waiting outside too in a pinch, so you shouldn't have to order one. During business hours, the attendant should be able to translate to the driver to you. Plenty of restaurants and attractions nearby.Rooms: Room was smaller than comparable alternatives and beds were less comfortable than other places I have stayed within walking distance of the Royal Park Shiodome. Despite size and lack of comforts, the rooms were well appointed with one notable exception--I traveled with a business associate, and the settee in his room was damaged, looking frayed around the edges. Convenient universal charger ports. Bathroom was clean but with minor maintenance things--grout missing in the shower/bathtub area, etc. Towels fresh daily. Free Wi-Fi in both private and public areas of the hotel is a definite plus. Faster than some public networks I have used in the past, too.

Sleep Quality - Cons: I had a queen-sized bed that was a bit too firm for my liking. For those used to a cushy bed, this isn't for you. The 2 pillows per person were a tad too tiny. Offering a soft body pillow would've made up for the firm bed.Pros: The room had an ionizer and a fresh air vent which made the air quality in the room much better for sleeping.2. Location - The hotel is walking distance to the Ginza district which is the main shopping area for top-brand stores in Tokyo. The hotel is located in a cluster of buildings with other higher-end hotels. There is access to the subway (Shiodome Station) from within the complex or from the street so getting around is quite easy.3. Rooms - The rooms are larger than usual for a hotel in Tokyo. I got a room with a nice view of the city on the 35th floor. The office table has a universal outlet so charging any electronic device won't a problem. The 40 inch flat screen TV is a pleasant accessory. The toilet is quite spacious with a bathtub as well as shower area. A unique accessory in the toilet is the heated electronic bidet/washer that's a welcome surprise especially in winter. Cleans very well, too! There's free Wi-Fi in the room and the hotel lobby. The hotel lobby on the 24th floor has a bar and lounge area overlooking part of the city.Cons: Housekeeping somehow forgot to replenish the complimentary bottled water in the room.4. Service - It was quick and efficient. Japanese people are especially polite and courteous despite some language difficulties.5. Value - The hotel is good value for the price. Of course, since this is more of a business hotel, the price is above average.6. Cleanliness - Like most things in Japan, private and public areas usually spotless.Except for the bed quality and that thing with the bottled water, I would have given this hotel 5 stars.","Pasig, Philippines","PnoiBoi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pasig, Philippines</strong>",29,4.0

You can also choose between 2 types of breakfast each morning - Japanese style or Western style. Jap style is a bento set where you can choose between rice/porridge/bean porridge and the rest are fixed, they give you things like salmon, pickles, some toufu thing etc. For Western style it is simple buffet style with your salad bar, eggs counter, bread counter, saussages, cereal, rice etc. Pretty yummy food, and the staff are really helpful and courteous.

I normally stay at Hotel Villa Fontaine Shiodome for its price and location (only 15 mints to my company's HQ building), but since I found better rate online, I decided to try here this time.Sorry Villa Fontaine, I am switching my royalties to Royal Park Hotel.Location is very good. Use any of trains (yurikamome, subway, or JR), only 5 mins away from any of their train station. Don't even have to walk outside to get to this hotel.Check in process is very smooth. I was in my room no time.Room is well designed. I like the shape of the desk, it gives you enough space but doesn't make it too crowded in a tiny hotel room. I like a little push cart they had under the bathroom sink. Counter space in the bathroom is limited but they placed a push cart to put extra bathroom stuff. It was unfortunate that I found a huge stain on the carpet in my room. Carpet was a bit outdated and I think it is about time they re-do the carpet. I don't think that huge stain will come off unless it is replaced.View from my room was good. Always nice to have good view from a room.During my stay, I had an opportunity to try their lobby bar. The wine list is limited but can't expect too much from a business hotel. The wine I had was 2009 Château de la Rivière. I generally like a wine from Bordeaux. The body is on lighter side but I still enjoyed. I think the view from the bar helped. Beautiful night skyline. I didn't like the price. This one is sold at $20-$30 at a store but they are selling here for $120. Mark up was more than I wanted to see. I wanted to drink wine anyway.I also had a chance to try their breakfast buffet one morning. View from this restaurant is very nice. Whenever I see the Tokyo Tower, I know I am in Japan.Food was decent, had a better breakfast buffet for the same price somewhere else. Next time I want to try their Japanese restaurant for breakfast.What makes so different for this hotel is the gym So rare to find a hotel with gym in Tokyo for business hotel. Yes, nicer hotel has gym but not at a typical business hotel for the price I paid for the room. I tend to overeat and drink too much while in Japan, and I end up gaining weight every single time I visit here. I had a nice work out at the hotel gym. Not too big but never that crowded.

The Hotel internet site is nice and appealing. The reality is a little bit of disappointment. Arriving by Taxi you go through a kind Mall door and difficult to find the Hotel elevator. Once you find it you have to go to 24th floor for reception and take another elevator for the rooms up to 36 or 38 floor.It look simple but when you are tired it is complicated to get two elevators. The rooms are Ok although a little bit expensive for the type and class of the rooms offered. There is no room service and no minibar in the room !! If you need a drink you have to go to the vending machines in each floor. After a day work If you need a sandwich or just a simple meal in your room that will be a problem. I don’t understand for the price and category of the Hotel without minibar or room service !There is one thing that irritates me every day at breakfast. As I don’t eat much in the morning I always ask for the Continental breakfast instead of the American breakfast. The first day they –literary – put a ‘police waiter’ controlling me if I had only one Juice and toast, croissant, etc. That was really a stupid situation as I felt badly. After I had the orange juice I went to the cereals and milk and the waiter come immediately to me informing I wasn’t allowed to eat cereals! It is the first time in my life the cereals don’t belong to Continental breakfast . So I went to get a toast and he came again and inform that I could eat only one toast !! My god is this real?! Continental Buffet and you can eat only one toast no cereals !The second day I try again as I thought it was a bad luck with the waiter. No the second day it was exactly the same treatment. I was paying € 150 p night and had a ‘police’ on my back during breakfast ?! No way I stop having breakfast at the Hotel. Two other things that make this hotel not to deserve so many stars is that the spa / gym is a tiny little room outside the Hotel and the business centre doesn’t exist. It is a small shop in the basement and outside where you are treated like a normal customer.The good thing is that you are near major subway lines and near two big buildings with lot of restaurants and few shops.","Porto, Portugal","JoseSM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Porto, Portugal</strong>",203,2.0

I arrived about 10am on the Monday morning, not expecting to be offered a room until my usual check in time of 3pm. I was happy to drop my bags and come back, but the kind lady on the desk phoned up to the cleaners and arranged to have a room cleaned for me within the hour. So i went for a coffee and took a walk around the area which is very modern, clean and quiet. After checking back in an hour later, i was given a card for a room on the 35th floor of the building. The hotel's reception is on the 25th floor, and believe that floors 1 - 25 are offices (don't hold me to it).Upon arrival to the room, i saw a cleaner inside finishing off, so decided to head back down to reception to wait for 15 minutes. It didn't bother me because they were doing me a favour offering early check-in.The lady who had served me behind the desk asked me if there was a problem to which i told her about the cleaner but said it's not a problem and i was happy to wait. She was so apologetic and in return offered me free breakfast tickets for my whole stay, and then immediately changed my room to another on the 36th floor. The views up here are fantastic. The room looks over the tokyo tower, and i can see the trains going past right below me.The room itself is great - clean, modern, and complete with a corner desk and mini sofa next to the window. The bathroom has a bath, with a shower attachment and the toilet seat is heated!The only negative of the room would be the non-existent wardrobe. It hasn't caused me a problem though, because they provide a shelf and a hanger rail between the bathroom and the main room itself (see pictures). Tsukiji fish market is a 15 minute walk, and can be seen from the hotel. Ginza (the rodeo drive of Tokyo) is one stop away on the metro, and the usual tourist hot spots like Shibuya and Shinbashi are a 10 minute metro ride away and costs the equivalent of £1.So i have little doubt i will run into any problems during my stay.

He told me they are already fully booked, which I understand. I asked if he could put an alert that just in case, if they have cancellation or something, let me know. But he just outright refused to do so - not even want to try or help.Hotel itself. This is one of the really rare ones that does not provide drinking (bottled) water!!! There are only two small bottles of water in the fridge. On my first night, I finished all water. And when I returned from work the next water, it wasn't refilled. I was busy with conference calls, couldn't call house-keeping or go to the convenient store, so had to drink tap water.The hotel practically does not offer room service. There is only one cardboard menu of the Japanese restaurant with about 3 different dishes. You can only enjoy 'daily specials' of the lobby lounge/bar in person, no delivery.

Gave us the keys and we were on our way.The room was large by Japanese standards, had a couch/table living room area, desk, and queen bed. The bathroom was beautiful - tub with shower outside the tub but enclosed in glass. Fancy toilet. They gave us bath fizzies, brushes, toothbrushes, shoe polishers, q-tips - all the basic necessities that people usually ask for - ready and available in our room. They provided nice shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion as well.The bed was very comfortable and we slept well. We were on the 26th floor facing the bay, and the view was awesome, we saw the sunrise every day.The restaurants on-site were really good. We tried the breakfast buffet several times, amazing healthy eggs, american style, japanese style and european style breakfasts. We arrived prior to 8am every day for breakfast and when we left close to 8am the line was around the corner, so go before 8 if you want to get right to the food without waiting. The chinese restaurant and japanese restaurant were both amazing, I recommend you try each at least once.The staff was helpful, but their command of the english language wasn't the same as a native speaker; a few times they misunderstood me and gave me bad directions. Once I asked for hot water for my tea and the server took my tea set away instead of bringing me more water. Small nits but just note that these guys are not native english speakers and may not be able to understand everything you say.We were located close to the train, but the train station was very confusing with lots of platforms and trains. The hotel staff gave us maps and tried to instruct us on where to catch trains, but the language barrier prevented us asking simple things like ""what landmark do we go to? what platform do we go to? what stop do we get off at?"", so we just got a little lost, then ended up back at the hotel and took taxis everywhere.One item to note that is peculiar to Tokyo, not just the hotel: A lot of things are cash only, so bring cash to exchange once you are there. They have an exchange machine in the hotel lobby, but no ATM. ATMs in english are few and far between, so it's difficult to get cash out anywhere. We are members at a small credit union, and it took 3d for us to find a CitiBank that our bank card worked in to withdraw cash. Big hassle. Train is cash only too FYI.Checking out went quickly, they ran my card without issues, and asked me if I wanted to pay in USD or Yen, so I opted for USD. For the room we got, the rate was very low.

It is also a short trip from Hammamatsu Station where the monorail from Haneda has its final stop, making it easy to come and go to the airport in 30 minutes or so. The relation quality-price is quite quite reasonable and the attentive staff has a good command of English.","Seoul, Seoul, South Korea","Edmundo F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, Seoul, South Korea</strong>",26,4.0

Great value at ~$155 a night!However, it may be a bit tricky to find the hotel for a first-timer, as the building does not have a clear sign on the outside that is visible from the street.

I was in a budget room (about 22k Yen a night inc B’fast = £129) but it was fine..it had a fridge, hair dryer, air con, slippers, bath robe, room safe, very useful desk – ie all the usual things but no view and I was on the 35th floor! The TV viewing was limited to BBC World News but I had come to Japan to work, not watch TV! The bed was comfortable, the window opened, the loo seat was heated (as is the norm in Japan) and the wifi was fab. The room was a good size for Tokyo.The staff were very friendly and helpful and the front desk had a good level of staffing so there was never a long wait. Breakfast was fine with a good selection although it did get a bit busy at peak times. However a new toaster is needed as the one they have is sooooo slow. And, Royal Park, how about some mugs instead of tea cups at breakfast?The closet Metro was Shimbashi and it was relatively easy to navigate to the hotel after you’d done it the first time and had your markers to aim for (Tower Records in this case!). There’s a Family Mart close by so great for snacks but this hotel is in the middle of the business district so it did feel a bit sterile (not like the hotel I moved to in Asakusa at a fraction of the cost for a few nights before I flew home!) but it was within waking distance to plenty of eateries and Ginza for shopping wasn’t too far away either plus the airport Limobus stopped at the hotel (if the times were good for your flight). If you want a business class hotel close to Shiodome then this is the one for you.BUT why oh why does the hotel want to change my towels and sheets EVERY DAY???? Yes every day! I could leave a little note on my bed asking to keep the same sheets but not the towels – come on Royal Park – get with the Green Sustainable Program of the world and allow us to keep the same towels for at least a few days.","Camberley, United Kingdom","GlobeTrotter_n_Kid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Camberley, United Kingdom</strong>",56,4.0

However, I traveled by myself; I don't think I would have been comfortable with more people in the room. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was nice and beautifully appointed with great accessories. I also appreciated the water. The hotel had a convenient shuttle service to the airport.

The location is excellent, with Shinbashi and Shiodome stations within 5 mins walking distance. There are direct train services from both the Haneda an Narita airport. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel, including eateries within the train station. We also love the little bakery shop at the hotel lobby -- the caramel pudding is excellent! In the evenings the open bar at the lobby has live performance and is a great place to hang out for a quick drink. It is a good idea to sign up for their hotel membership as the points accumulated can be used to offset room charges for the next stay. Will definitely stay here again.",,lppst,11,5.0

The hotel is perfect for a business trip. Rooms are quite good given Tokyo standards, not too big but fine for a few days on business. My room was facing south towards the Tokyo tower and the view was quite impressive, with the main train line (Yamanote and Shinkansen) giving you a feeling of this never stopping city (multiple train running every minute). I was able to work without problem.The breakfast was impressive, I have to say one of the best I have ever had. The choice was really excellent from a western point of view (but you also had japanese choices).But one of the main benefit of this hotel is the location. Right into Shiodome, but a short walk from Shimbashi JR station (Yamanote and other JR lines) and where you also have the Tokyo Metro Ginza line and Toei Asakusa line. Also, you have the terminus of the Yurikamome line for Odaiba and (closer) the Toei Oedo line. I was able to reach the Oedo line very very easily from the lower level exit from hotel into the Shiodome lower walk (basement). So in a nutshell you have quite a variety of train and subway lines to get everywhere. The hotel location is excellent if you need to visit Ginza, Shimbashi, Shiodome, Odaiba, Roppongi (via Oedo line). Obviously getting farther away would not be a problem either as you have plenty of public transport option (e.g. Shinjuku on the other side would be reachable direct by Oedo line or Yamanote line then changing to JR Chuo at Tokyo sta. - Shibuya would be reachable direct by Ginza line, and Tsukiji is also close by Oedo line or Asakusa line just one stop and a short walk).Overall a very good experience.",Rome,"Meteoman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rome</strong>",34,4.0

But we were pleasantly surprised about with the quality of this hotel. Having spent the days prior to arriving at this hotel and the Ritz Carlton in Seoul, Korea our expectations where set a higher than usual, but my opinion about this hotel is very positive especially when comparing to a hotel like the Ritz. First the positives: 1. location. The hotel is located in the GInza/ Minato area which is very close to high end shopping and great restaurants within walking distance. The hotel is located within a 10 minute walk from Matsuya Ginza Shopping mall as was as the Mitsukoshi Ginza, both malls have all of the high end stores you can dream of. Regarding the food in the area you have all different types, from french and Italian to Indian and Chinese and of course fast food like MCD's and the likes. 2. Location. Shimbashi station basically connected to the hotel so you can walk from the doors of the hotel to the station. This station has about 3 JR lines if im not mistaken and a Tokyo Metro station underground. Therefore, the convenience of this hotel was fantastic. Shimbashi station is just 1 stop away from Tokyo station on the JR line and from Tokyo station your transportation options are endless. 3. Hotel was very clean. Both the common areas such as the lobby and elevators were very clean as well as the room. Our room was very clean with no dust. (my wife is highly allergic so the smallest amount of dust would set off a thunderstorm of sneezes) Basically, this is my measurement of a dusty / dirty hotel. The hotel also has a great view of part of the bay and I would imagine that some rooms should have a view of Ginza and Tsukiji (fish Market). Our room had a partially obstructed view of the bay which was very nice and also relaxing to see the red flashing lights on the rooftops of the buildings nearby. 4. Staff. The staff at the hotel was very nice and also very helpful. Even though their English was limited we were still able to communicate enough to get by without any major hitches. For instance, we asked the concierge almost every morning for directions and maps and she would take the time to explain to us the area to which we were going, how to get there and even what exit to use at the metro/train station so that we would not get lost. She would also recommend places to see that were not on our agenda that were worth while and we never felt pushed into going to a place that we didn't want to go to. She basically helped us be more efficient in our 4 days in Tokyo which was a great help for us. 5. The products used in the shower: Of all the hotels that I have every stayed, this hotel uses some of the best products I have used. (with exception of Mandarin Oriental) Shiseido Le Mondor (We could not find it in stores to buy 5 gallons of each) Excellent shampoo and conditioner and body wash. Great scent, very gentle on the skin and very long lasting. We loved the products.. We looked everywhere and asked everyone!! We could not find them!! 6. Late Checkout: We arrived to the hotel from Narita on the train since the fare was only about 15USD but returning from Tokyo to NRT the fare would be the same on the train as it would be on the bus (30 USD pp) so we opted for the limo bus that picked us up at the front door of the hotel. We booked the limo bus through the hotel and the concierge extended out checkout time to 2pm (the scheduled hotel pickup time for bus). This was great because we were able to wake up and pack, go out for some quick shopping, come back to hotel and shower and be ready for the bus to pick us up without any problems. The cons: We did not have many complaints about this hotel but if I had to list them they would be the following: 1. Room size; room size was a bit small. Our room was a standard double and it felt a little cramped. However, the bathroom was a good size with ample shower and separate bathtub. I wish they would have crammed a king bed in the room. It would have made it nicer to sleep in. 2. Bed too soft for my taste. Everyone's taste for how they like their bed is different. I like bed to be soft on the top and firm on the inside. However, for my tastes, the bed we had was too soft and it felt like I was sinking into the mattress. Again, some may enjoy a really soft and plush mattress but others may not so it is up to individual tastes. I still enjoyed my nights of sleep at the hotel because it was a very high room that had little outside noise and it stayed relatively dark in the morning with direct sunlight hitting our window. Conclusion: It may not be the park hyatt (lost in translation filmed here) or the shangri la hotel but for the price it is a fantastic hotel in a great location with many things to see and do nearby. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is Tokyo and is looking for a great place to stay.","Miami, Florida","jnapcruz326</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",11,5.0

I decided to give it a go after I read the reviews. I was travelling with a toddler. There was quite a walk to Ginza and I wasn't familiar with the places around this hotel. Can't be happy enough with the rooms and service. It was very thoughtful of them to provide children slippers and toothbrush for my little girl. I bought too many things at the end and had to get boxes from them. They cost JPY350 for large and JPY250 for medium size. Hotels around Shinjuku charge JPY200 only for a big durable box. The boxes from Royal Park Hotel were poor in quality. They can be poked easily with a pen and then broken into a large holes. I asked the check in counter lady at the airport to help me seal those holes. I used the limousine bus to get to airport and during transit the boxes were broken. I was a bit worried that my stuff were going to fall out of it! I didn't try the breakfast buffet as Starbucks and other breakfast spots are close enough. Having a toddler travelling with me, I worried if I ever made it to the buffet breakfast. Love the views from the hotel, we had our curtains opened day and night, to enjoy beautiful views of Shiodome. Upon checkout, staff advised me to join as a member but I just logged into your website and can't figure out how to go about this. No coffee was provided in the room and the green tea powder tasted yuck. Somehow they stop refilling the shampoo and conditioner on the last two nights of our stay. Wonder what brand they use for shampoo and conditioner because they are really good!

Pros: This hotel is right in between 2 subway stations ... one is 1 min walk, the other is 2 min. I was there only 5 days ... but it was enough to make me realize how important, convenient and helpful this was. The interior of the building is very nice. Lobby is well designed, with a nice bar in middle of it. I arrived a few hours before check-in time. While I was given a quick speech how the check-in is not until later, they did allow me to go to my room at that time. There was a very decent work station in my room, right next to the window. Room was equipped with free wifi that worked really well. Breakfast was very good with standard food that you see elsewhere in the world. I was expecting more local, traditional food ... but this was not the case. However, it was still good. The views from the restaurants are really nice as well. Generally speaking, hotel staff was friendly ... but it did not come natural. It seemed as if they were trying too hard ... but I guess that this is a cultural difference. Cons: While the proximity to the subway stations is good, you are not in an area that has much character ... you are actually next to bunch of sky scrapers. When you walk in, you have to go to floow 24 or 25 (I think). This is where the reception is, and than you walk across the hall and take the elevators up to your room. This was sometimes inconvenient when going out of the hotel. My room was facing the office building in the back ... so not a great view at all. The close had no door and was in the open ... I prefer that they have a closet with doors on them. Hotel sushi bar (one or two floors above the lobby) was extremely expensive. I had a set of Sushi (approximately 20 pieces) and a beer which came out to about $180 USD, but quite frankly it was not that special. The restaurant had a very old look to it, it was fairly empty and they had a smoking section ... which was very easy to spot when you are a non-smoker. Overall, this was a decent hotel in a great location. For business, it is very good ... but if you are there on a vacation, you may want to stay in a hotel that is closer to one of the districts with more character. P.s. Be aware ... if you like to walk and explore .. going out of the hotel and turning left will lead you to an adult entertainment district. Not knowing this, I walked right into it .. and was approached by at least 50 ladies who were offering me a ""special"" massage. However. not to far aware from here is a decent district with many cool restaurants and bars.",Canada,"TravellerABC0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",26,3.0

We got a room on the 35th floor and for 5 nights we paid something like AUD 850+ only through bookings.com. The views are obviously amazing being so high and because we were on our honeymoon they gave us a free bottle of wine. The room itself is decently sized for Tokyo standards - not as small as people kept telling us. They provide all toiletries including cotton wool, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, body wash, shaver, cotton buds, etc - Shiseido brand no less. We found most hotels in Japan are very good in this area of providing toiletries. The hotel lounge is on the lobby floor as well and has nice seats right by the window which gives you a really nice view of Tokyo. There's also free wifi in the room and the hotel lobby.The location of the hotel is great. Walking distance to Ginza and Tsukiji market.

The station itself has lots of small restaurants and we tried 2 of them - an izakaya and a porridge place. Both were really good.We went to the hotel from Narita airport and it requires a change at Tokyo train station to the JR Yamanote line or relevant subway line to get to Shimbashi Station. Just remember to always save the maps of how to get to the hotel so that you know which direction you need to head to because the train stations are very big and depending on which exit you exit at, you could really end up on very different sides of the building.

Shiodome area is perfect for a base to see the city, and the two metro lines run underneath as well as a skytrain above. the Royal Park Hotel is atop a skyscraper on the 24th floor upwards and the views from the room windows were just spectacular. The rooms themselves are perfectly appointed, far ahead of expectations and the heated ""smart toilet"" a revelation. The staff speak excellent English and are extremely helpful, even when the hotel lobby is very busy - understandably so because this is a big hotel. It is spotlessly clean and has all the latest technology and gadgets etc as you'd expect from a Japanese hotel room but is very spacious which you may not expect from a room in such a popular part of Tokyo. The deal I got on the four nights here was brilliant when I booked it and looks almost absurdly good in hindsight having stayed there.

My first ever trip to Japan and despite only knowing the basics (Konnichwa, Arigatou gozaimasu etc) I never had a problem with my lack of Japanese. All the reception staff and nearly all of the waiters spoke english. - Downstairs bar area - perfect for meeting business guests, relaxing with a few beers (I recommend the Super Dry beer, served at -2'C!) or catching up on email (there is a bar seating area not next to the main bar perfect for this).Fitness room: it is literally, a room, with 2 treadmills, a bike and some free weights. Perfect for a sunday afternoon workout but busy weekday mornings. Take some resistance bands and do a set of circuits with pressups, prisoner squats and ab work in your room instead I'd say.Breakfast: Buffet style - they do eggs to order.

Luckily, the Royal Park Shiodome does live up to its reputation. It’s not on top of a major transport interchange like Tokyo Station or Shinagawa, but it IS connected by an open underground passageway from its Basement level, to Shimbashi station, which is a hub for JR surface lines, as well as the Asakusa and Ginza underground lines. And on the other side of the hotel, also connected to the basement exit, is Shiodome station. In short, the hotel is very well connected to both transport and all the conveniences of the train stations, and you won’t feel the brunt of the rain, sleet and wind in accessing them.In terms of rooms, facilities, and service, the hotel is a winner. There are a number of different room types – I had a standard room for one night, and a SOHO for 5. The SOHO was spacious and well designed, with a full desk and work area, including stationery, computer and printer. There was plenty of closet and storage space, and a big counter and cabinet with the half sized refridgerator and microwave. The hotel gives you unlimited quantities of shisedo shampoo, body wash and conditioner—and a range of other toiletries. No sacrifices here. In contrast to the “charge extra for everything” approach at other Japanese hotels, the Royal Park offers free wifi and free access to the gym-- the only downside is that the gym is rather basic, and there is no pool. There are coin laundry machines in case you don't want to pay for the hotel to do your washing. Service is good. The staff pay attention to waiting times at reception, and if there are more than two people in line, someone goes into the office to ask more front desk staff to come out. I had to change rooms because I had reserved two different room types, and the staff told me to pack my luggage and leave it in room #1 for the hotel staff to move when the 2nd room was ready. It was the most painless room change I have ever had anywhere in the world. The hotel staff is able to arrange any number of things that a foreigner might need, like English newspapers, stamps, airport transport, and so on. All in all, the Royal Park Shiodome gets my vote. It feels and performs almost to five stars, while allowing you to be thankful that you are only paying for four stars.

But this is not a turn-off. Hotel staffs were well-versed in Engilsh. Requested for Hotel to safekeep our bulk luggages while we made a trip to Chubu area, and Hotel was ok with it.

Glad that instructions were received by Hotel easily, with no extended explanation.Rooms were spacious.Limousine transfer from Hotel to Airport on our departure day was swift, and clear instructions were given to us on which terminal to alight. Hotel staff had actively asked for feedback from us, not through filling out a feedback form, but through a verbal conversation, while we were waiting for the limousine bus to the Airport. More than often, we had wanted to provide feedback, but find it a hassle to fill out the feedback form. Great engagement. A minor improvement, if possible, would be providing bottled water in the rooms. Understand that it may be more environmentally friendly to boil fresh water from the electric flask provided in the room, but it would definitely be more convenient for travelers with bottled water.Toilet amenities were complete.Hotel rooms were above 25th floor, thus no street noise and sleep quality is enhanced.

The other 2 hotels that I know of are Park Hotel in Shiodome and century southern in shinjuku. The hotel has even prepared teeth brush and slippers for them. I was also surprised when I was allowed to check in early in the morning as I have previously informed the hotel that I would arrive early at 8am. I think this is very rare in Japan. It was easy and fast to take the airport limousine from Haneda airport to the hotel and as I have checked the website, it was easy to locate the reception on the 24th floor.

The night and morning view is refreshing and gives you an interesting perspective of the business vibrance of the city. There is a convenience store just below the hotel and it offers all the necessities that any business traveller requires. Additionally, the hotel provides a delivery service from the TV menu. After dinner, the Ginza/Shimbashi area is rather dead. There is not supper place if you are planning to grab something quick when you check in late at night.I reserved a Standard Double Room. Bathroom was large. Huge area for standing shower with an attached bath tube for another person. Basin / Toilet area is a little tight due to the large shower area but still sufficient for one person to settle all his toilet needs comfortably. Bed was a little disappointing due to the high usage? Bed springs felt non-existent as I sank in deeper than expected. Probably requires a change soon. Pillows may be too small and soft for my liking. Nonetheless, I had decent sleep. Desk area with a small sofa for reading and admiring the Tokyo Bay area. Internet connection is perfect with high throughput. Had no issues with video streaming.Staff are very well trained in English and they attempt to reply in proper English every time. I applaud them for their excellent training and courage to speak. Also appreciate the service counter providing advise on food locations and access to other parts of Tokyo. Concierge always ready to help with liaising of delivery / TA-Q-BIN.Overall, a satisfied customer.","Singapore, Singapore","booonster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",29,4.0

Too bad it stank like someone been smoking permanently for years in there. We did initially ask for non-smoking and were given the smelliest smoking room they could find. I'm guessing it's that the staff just didn't understand English and just went ""yes, yes""... Now - another complaint. This time directly with the manager. After some back and forth he managed to find us a room which was non-smoking and offered us a bottle of water for free for the trouble.There was no-one on arrival - so I brought my six suitcases myself upstairs to the 24th floor (ok, there's an elevator :) Not an issue if I stay in a 2 or 3 star hotel. But for 250USD/night I do expect better than this). Since the lobby is on 24th floor they then organized a porter to bring the luggage from there to the 26th floor. The porter was a 40kg (max) tiny girl - with whom I couldn't help but feel sorry. Seriously - who takes the smallest, skinniest staff as porters - did she do something wrong and got punished?I was amazed how poor the English skills in this hotel are in general. I found waitresses speaking much better English than the hotel guys. Departed 2 days earlier than originally planned - kept the stay to the minimum...The bed quality was average. The room was clean - the view ok. Location very convenient.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","picaye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",28,3.0

Back one year later I find the hotel in better condition than last year. They haven't done so much to the facilities but service quality has increased a notch. The hotel is located in Shiodome City Center, a rather new office complex with a lot of shops and restaurants. Ginza is adjacent, about a five minute walk away. When you take the elevator from the reception (which is on the 24th floor) to street level you'll find three subway lines and JR Line - communications are great (Shimbashi station and Shiodome station). From Shiodome station you can go directly to Shinjuku and Roppongi. As always in Japan, rooms are very neat and clean. I can't really complain about room size either (however, do not expect American sized rooms). Bed was great. Breakfast is served from 0630 to 1000 on the 24th floor. Spectacular view included. I usually book a room with breakfast included and find good value in that. There are both cold and hot items on the breakfast buffet. All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Tokyo. There are lower cost alternatives but I find this place has struck the balance price/value exactly right.

It provides the most convenient, affordable travel around Japan.As per nearly all Japanese hotels, the staff are extremely pleasant and the facilities very clean.

This is a very nice hotel and has incredible views of Tokyo. I love how the lobby is not on the ground floor. It’s very clean and inviting and has amazing views from the lobby and breakfast area. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We had a double room, and it is a bit smaller than most US travelers are used to. I wouldn’ t say it was small, but it was cozy. The bathroom is clean and I love the large glass enclosed shower. There is decent space in the bathroom, which is nicely appointed. We had a great view of the city from our room.Breakfast was very good. I had the western breakfast and the eggs, pancakes, and breads were delicious. I really enjoyed breakfast looking at Tokyo through the window. The service was incredible – the front desk and concierge were very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. There is not a whole lot to do around the hotel, but the subway is just a short walk away (we weren’t in the hotel that much anyways). Overall, I really enjoyed my stay here.

Located in the Shiodome area of the Minato-ku district of Tokyo, it is convenient to the famed Ginza district, has views of the Tokyo Tower, and is adjacent to stations that serve several train and subway lines.With its three restaurants, a lobby lounge, and a variety of amenities including the Mandara Spa, the Royal Park Hotel, however, could be a destination unto itself.The property is beautifully done in a decidedly Japanese motif, but without taking the minimalist approach too far. Halls are done elegantly, with dark woods and carpet accented by low lights.Guest rooms can be small; it is, after all, Tokyo. However, even my basic standard double room was luxuriously appointed and well equipped. In just 20 square meters, it contained a desk and work station with both wireless and very fast wired internet access, a queen sized bed, a lounging couch, a modestly-sized flat-screen TV that fit the scale of the room perfectly, bottled water, a hot pot with china tea cups, and an assortment of teas.Japanese dressing gowns were waiting in the bedside table, and slippers were tucked under the luggage rack in the open closet area.The bathroom was complete with a deep Japanese soaking tub, a TOTO toilet with heated seat and bidet function, a heated mirror so one could see after a steamy shower, a hair dryer and a variety of individually packaged amenities, including a razor, toothbrush and paste, and hairbrush. Ceilings were just over 9’ high, contributing to a much more open feel than one would expect given the limited floor space.According to the hotel’s web site, a basic standard double room starts at ¥18,000 per night including tax, or about US$220, plus taxes of about 16.65%.Great service can make a so-so hotel memorable, while the experience at an otherwise beautiful hotel can be severely diminished by poor service. The Royal Park offers the best of both.Arriving after a 10-½ hour flight from Seattle followed by a 90-minute bus ride from Narita airport, the members of our small group were ushered to an area where we were presented with our room keys, Wi-Fi access codes and breakfast coupons without having to stop at the front desk. This enabled us to head to our rooms quickly so we could freshen up before going to dinner.Our hosted dinner in the Harmony restaurant was a buffet of primarily Japanese-style dishes, artfully prepared and presented, and delicious. The attendants were the perfect blend of attentive while not being intrusive, making sure we each had the nibbles we needed, and whisking used plates and glasses away virtually as soon as they were set down.After dinner, and despite my lack of sleep, I determined to go on a photo safari of Tokyo’s Ginza district. The concierge was busy with other guests, so a front desk attendant beckoned me over and offered to help. He provided advice of what to see, noting that many department stores would already be closed because it was after 9 p.m., and gave me handwritten instructions on which train lines I should take to get to my destination.Virtually every hotel employee I encountered, whether assisting me directly or passing in the hall, would give that slight Japanese bow, offer a “Gozimasu!” or, at the very least, a pleasant smile. It was Japanese hospitality at its finest.Attendants at the buffet breakfast the next morning displayed the same high level of hospitality. Gracious yet efficient, they seated guests quickly and kept tables cleared. Offerings included both Japanese and Western-style items, with a station that made omelets, scrambled eggs, and fresh-cooked waffles to order.The Royal Park also strives to accommodate its guests who smoke, which appeared to be much more common in Tokyo than in Seattle. Accommodations included an open-door smoking booth just off the main lobby. It was so well ventilated that I wasn’t aware of the smell of cigarette smoke when I walked by just a few feet away.Like the hotel’s lobby, the Harmony restaurant, the Xenlon Grand China Grille, the Lobby Lounge, the Pastry Boutique, and the gift shop are on the 24th floor and provide great views of the Tokyo river. The Mikuri Kurumaya restaurant on the 25th floor offers “traditional Japanese food.” Guest rooms, which are on even higher floors, provide the best views of the city.Based on my brief experience, I highly recommend the Royal Park. Given the opportunity, I would definitely go back.","Seattle, Washington","TheTravelPro_us</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",347,5.0

My tip for Tokyo is to plan your trip so you get the best eating and drinking experience, so much to choose from but not easy to find, you need to know where you're going. Take advantage of concierge and spend your valuable time in Japan knowing when and where you are going rather than wandering around not sure whether to take the plunge etc The best restaurants and bars are high up in tower blocks and looking at the foyer you'd think you were headining into a meeting, without planning you'd never know these place exist.Enjoy.",London,"mrwalkerLondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",19,5.0

The view from the 35th floor was quiet breathtaking and puts all the high rise buildings within japan into its true perspective.

The room was spacious enough with a vending machine in the hallway and best of all is equipped with free wifi. The views, whilst you have your breakfast is amazing but be sure to start off by 7:30 since it gets quiet crowded quickly. The shiodome city center besides has close to 40 restaurants but everything closes by 9 pm. We tried the Chinese restaurant at the hotel and it was quick and delicious needless to say value for money. Shimbashi is an Ideal place to live in when in Tokyo since Everything is close by.The metro (get a SUICA pass if you plan on taking the metro for a few days since it automatically charges you for the respective fare instead of having to struggle with fare and coins) is the best means of traveling and discovering how to use it is a real rush.

The hotel is located very close to Hamarikyu Park, Tsukiji Fish Market and the Ginza shopping area with upscale designer shops and department stores and tons and tons of restaurants, cafes and eateries of all kinds. It was also very close to both Shiodome and Shinbashi stations, where you could catch the metro/subway and JR lines to anywhere in this huge and interesting city.

The restaurant that serves the Western breakfast buffet also has nice views. I would recommend the Western breakfast, not because I'm Western, but because there is a wider variety of choice, which includes some Japanese foodstuffs (miso, rice, grilled salmon, pickled vegetables, etc). The Internet was very fast -- LAN, not wireless. My one complaint is that the satellite tv stations continue to be limited to mostly Japanese stations with either CNN or the BBC. And CNN was dubbed in Japanese with all the Egypt unrest coverage. A great location -- you're just above the Tokyo metro stop and there is a 24-hour convenience shop called FamilyMart.

Our room was facing another building (Nippon Television Tower) but blinds provided privacy (we came back to the room too late to enjoy the view any way but we enjoyed a lower room rate). Room was very clean, everything was working, at check in everyone spoke English. The bathroom was very modern (marble, contemporary sink, fogless mirror, Toto) but also had a deep Japanese tub so that one can take a show or soak in the tub (try the provided salts). A lot of complementary supplies: shampoo, conditioner, body soap, face & hand soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, razor, cotton pads, hairbrush, shower cap, hair band, bath salts, sewing kit, shoe shine cloth, slippers (they leave a new pair every day), hair drier, cotton dressing gown. In the room there is also hot water pot, bags with green and black tea, tea cups, refrigerator, computer (with web access). Computer display doubles as a TV monitor. The location was the best for our needs: 1-5 minutes to reach several subway stations and Shinbashi station on JR line (important if you have a JR pass and not too far to walk with your bags), walking distance (~10 min) to Fish Market. The hotel is on the bus route from the airport (after a long flight it was so good to get on the bus and look around instead of navigating the train and the subway with the luggage to get to the hotel, the first 33,000 yen well spent in Japan). We did not eat in the hotel (we went to Fish Market for breakfast instead). There are many restaurants in the Shiodome complex across from the hotel (Thai restaurant was good). There is a small convenience store in the same building as the hotel (just basics as in stores in the US on gas stations). Better walk to the supermarket by the Shinbashi station (walk underground from the hotel to Shinbashi station and look for the directions to Yurikamone line. Once you reach the street level (with the building housing the entrance to Yurikamone station in front of you), take a right, and once you pass Tourist Information you will see the supermarket entrance). Shinbashi on JR is only one station away from Shinagawa (not as busy as Tokyo station), from where you can take a train to Kyoto (we also took JR trains to Nikko and Kamakura).","Birmingham, Alabama","Yulia M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",1,5.0

The airport bus to the hotel did not run so frequently, therefore took the Narita Express train to Tokyo Station, then a short taxi ride to the hotel.Hotel Lobby, restaurant and room were nice. It was a very good business hotel rather than a luxrious hotel. I like the corridor that leading to my room. Room and bathroom were in good size (Japanese standard). Unfortunately the window of my room was facing an office building and one could not open the window blind for any privacy. There was a computer in the room via the television. However, the cable socket for my own laptop was not working and therefore needed to use the computer cable for the TV instead. There was a safe in one of the drawers but that drawer kept sliding opened. Light could be a little brighter in the bathroom. Breakfast at the western restaurant was pretty nice with good view. Overall I enjoyed my stay there.","Hong Kong, China","BPK123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",73,4.0

Even when we had a problem with the TV, they were quick to react and fixed our problem.The Shiodome is located in the heart of business Tokyo and walking distance to Ginza, so not too many tourists around here, just ppl travelling to Tokyo on business. The tour companies use it as a pick up hotel, so that has advantedges. However if you want the more Tokyo buzz i suggest staying over in Shibuya, Harajuku or Ropongi. Another positive is that JR Shimbashi station (for those with JR rail pass), on the main Tokyo loop line is a short walk from the hotel, for non rail pass uses, the Shiodome station is close by, so you can get around easily. Additionally the monorail to Tokyo Bay (Odaiba) is also walking distance.The negative side to this hotel was the guest services staff, we found that if you weren't dressed in a suit, then they will ignore you to a level of rudeness (ie. prented to make phone calls until you go away) We asked them to see if they could book a tour for us, after saying yes, they never did, and we did it ourselves with our broken Japanese. The hotel has washing machines and dryers for use, if you do not wish to use laundry services, very handy for those staying some time in Japan. For the price, I would recommend other hotels than the Shiodome. I only stayed here as I was able to obtain a corporate discount. BTW, we booked a semi double room, it was more than comfortable for 2 ppl and the bathroom size was decent. I would recommend, to save some Yen, go with the semi double.","Melbounre, Australia","Hashimotto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbounre, Australia</strong>",58,3.0

When a friend in Tokyo recommended Shiodome area, I was a bit apprehensive because the area is a new development I am not familiar with. However I was very pleased with my choice of location, and especially the Shiodome Tower.Initially we wanted to stay at Park Tokyo (#1 on trip advisor) but Shiodome tower got the unanimous vote by all my contacts in Tokyo ( two of whom work in the travel and hotel industries) and that's where we stayed.We traveled with another couple, who went on to different cities after Tokyo. Between the two groups, we stayed at 7 hotels and ryokans total. Everyone agreed Shiodome Tower was the best experience by far. Here are the highlights:**Throughly modern, immaculate, tastefully decorated, yet affordable by Tokyo standards ($200 incl. taxes and breakfast). Room was exceptionally quiet; I was right by the elevators and the vending machine room and I never heard either of them.**Nice bed and light comforter, and they offered selections of pillows to choose from! (call housekeeping)**Smallish rooms but well laid out (at 26sq.m it is bigger than Park Tokyo's 22sq.m) Another factor in choosing Shiodome over Park, for our 6 day stay.** Only 3 - 4 min walk to Shimbashi station. This was a major factor in choosing Shiodome Tower over Park Tokyo. Between Ginza subway line and JR Yamanote (green) line, I can get to everywhere with ease (Asakusa, Ueno, Tokyo, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Akihabara, Ginza)**Close to Tokyo Station - taxi was affordable after Narita Express from the airport, and catching bullet train was a snap**Walking distance to Ginza district and Tsukiji Fish Market.**Amenities such as 24 hour coin laundry and clothes line over the bathtub were handy. **Free internet access/PC in room. No room service but they have cyber concerge and deliver food from local restaurants**Great breakfast and lunch buffet (you can use the meal coupon for lunch as well - lunch buffet is 500 yen extra, or choose from their prix fix menus)**AM/PM and 7-11 convenient stores are right there (stocks all sorts of drinks, sandwiches, snacks, Japanese bento box lunches)**Cafe on the 1st or 2nd floor of the bldg. (not within the hotel) seemed pretty reasonable. We thought estaurants in the hotel were quite good but more pricey as you'd expect. Also there is Caretta shopping area close by, which is filled with shops and eateries.It is true that Shiodome is a new developed area with futuristic and somewhat sterile towers. However, I felt I can get Tokyo experience (and the hustle and bustle) anywhere else I went to - on Subways included - so I didn't miss the ""lack of local color"" in Shiodome. There were plenty of it on the other side of Shimbashi station anyway. It was nice to come back to the clean, modern, quiet area.Be sure to use the express checkout on the PC (go talk to the front desk to set it up beforehand) since the check out line can be long at times.","Los Angeles, CA","pongstress</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",39,5.0

We chose it due to the decent reviews it had on here, and also for the hotel being business-oriented, so good advice in our mother tongue would be available!! We had booked a standard room through Opodo, but when we arrived, we upgraded to a room with a view for a fair price. And WHAT a view! We were placed on the 32nd floor overlooking some gardens and the harbour, sure, there are a few towers in there as well, but it really was awe-inspiring, especially at night. The room was immaculate, EXCEPTIONALLY quiet(we heard nothing during our stay, above or below)and yes, as someone else in these reviews mentions, very European in design. In my opinion this was great, as the rooms are not huge(you need to pay $$$ for this in Tokyo) so a minimalist, functional style fits perfectly. There was free internet access, a decent mini-bar (even though the beer was a few Yen cheaper in the vending machine down the hall!!)and the bed was very comfortable. We used the laundry service, which was efficient and exact on time. One minor quibble would be that there was no iron/ironing board but there was a laundryroom which one could use any time on the 26th floor - which I did and it was fine.The bathroom was a decent size, and had a glass door-separated wet room with a shower and a bath and that was great, again clean and well presented with some very handy free products(razor, toothbrushes, hairclips, etc). I'll leave the description of the toilet to new visitors - it has...interesting functions!With regard to location - the hotel really came into it's own... the building is placed within a large complex of buildings (the lobby itself is on the 24th floor of the tower), and there are many restuarants around, as well as a 7-11. Shiodome Metro station was about a 5-10 minute walk(quite well sign-posted) and this is on the Ginzaline, which enabled us to get round ALL of Tokyo very easily!! It's a great system and after a day on it, one gets quite used to the network, much simpler than London to a visitor.One word of advice with regard to the rooms - all the standard rooms are on the other side of the hotel without a view, so you do have to pay extra - I think we paid about £35 extra a night - WELL worth it for the 4 days we were there. Though I'm sure if you were on a budget, the rooms would still be good, just without the vista!All in all, we had a fantastic time at The Royal Park...it made our stay in Tokyo a wonderful one and I cannot rate it more highly.Last thing: the lobby bar has a great view, too. The coffee/drinks are quite pricey but the service is excellent and the pastries they serve in there are heavenly!!!

The hotel is very new and seems extremely clean. My room was on the small side but was very comfortable and functional. I should mention that this hotel is obviously geared toward business travel. The rooms feature an adequate work space, the location is in a new business complex and the lobby lounge is an excellent place to meet and discuss business. It is also worth mentioning that there was no charge for high-speed internet and even the overseas calls I made were not outrageously priced. If you are looking for a cultural experience or a taste of local flair, this would NOT be the hotel to choose. This hotel is no different than any that you would find in a business district in Los Angeles or Houston or Chicago. In fact, the entire complex of Shiodome is very generic. If you want to be surrounded by office buildings and Starbucks and Kinko's and people speaking English... then Shiodome is your place. Personally, I get enough of that in LA. That said... just a few steps from the complex are some areas that give you the true essence of Tokyo... Ginza, the Tsujuki Fish Market and a scattering of yakitori restaurants and shot bars under the Yamanote Line. Bottom line, The Royal Park Shiodome Tower is a good compromise for a Western business traveler that needs a good location and doesn't want to deviate too far from the familiar.","Los Angeles, California","RobAllemanLA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,4.0

The best feature of the hotel (at least to me) is its great spa with several hot tubs and 2 saunas complete with Bali-style relaxation room. Some packages include the spa, which is definitely a better deal than breakfast package. There are lots of cafes nearby that offer nice and affordable breakfast.The gym is free and accessible with the room key. There is even a Kinko's in the same building and it's just so much more useful than a regular lame business center. Every room comes with a high-speed internet connection and a full PC with MS office suite. It's also the last stop for a limousine bus to go to Narita: it's much faster to get to the airport than from other locations like Ebisu, Shinjuku or Shibuya as you don't have to go through Tokyo (inside Yamanote Line, I mean).Single rooms are pretty small, though very nicely decorated.
