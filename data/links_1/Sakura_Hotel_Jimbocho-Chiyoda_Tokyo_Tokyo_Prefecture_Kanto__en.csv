This is personally my 3rd/4th time staying here, so it’s safe to say I really like it here.Best part for me is the staff, led by Peter Chen. Yeah, the rooms are a little small, but it is the best value place I have stayed in Tokyo. Besides, what are you doing in Tokyo if you’re just going to stay in your room?Actually, I did stay in my room for a good chunk of our last trip since I got sick. And I was so thankful that the beds were plenty comfortable for me, and I was able to get back on my feet after only a couple of days.The all-you-can-drink tea (among other drinks) at the 1F had a lot to do with it.So thanks again to the crew at Sakura Jimbocho for taking care of me.","Matsue, Japan","SirEdge</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Matsue, Japan</strong>",0,5.0

ROOMThe room was clean and minimal with a very comfy bed and duvet, dark blackout curtains and one shelf for hanging things. There is a TV but it is in such a position that you would never use it. There was enough room to put a suitcase in a corner and unpack our belongings out the way on the large shelf above the door. The room comes with a kimono and slippers which was nice to wear when chilling. We rented towels for $1 each. Rooms are cleaned every day. The shared bathroom was no issue at all for us as the showers and toilets are in their own sound-proof private cubicles meaning that you get full privacy once inside. Plus they are always very clean. In 8 days of bathroom use I never had to wait to use a shower/toilet.StaffThe staff are great- my personal favourites were Peter and Naomi, but all of them were nice and accommodating. Food The food in the cafe below was quite impressive! I couldn´t believe the taste of the arroz con mariscos for a low budget hotel cafe - just as good as what I´ve eaten in Spanish seaside cities like Cadiz. They have a great range of international dishes and Japanese food and you can get a cooked meal at any time 24/7 - amazing! The breakfast offered with the room was amazing value and I liked that it was self-serve. It includes tea, coffee, juice, toast, butter, jam, marmalade or other spreads, and soup. After a while I got sick of eating bread (I normally eat fewer carb than Japanese diet) and started ordering eggs for around $1.50 instead and having the soup - great!!All in all I would 100% come back to this hotel next time I come back to Tokyo. It is more than enough for our needs, great English-speaking staff, cool vibe and comfy rooms! Also left us enough cash to blow like crazy in Tokyo!!

Shared bathroom is well maintained regularly and near the rooms. - Staff were nice enough to let us leave our bags temporarily even after we checked out so we can eat lunch before going to the airport.- Hotel is about a 3-5 min walk from the nearest station which is very convenient especially at night. Area is pretty safe so that's a big plus.- There is a convenience store near the hotel but the hotel itself has a cafe that's open 24/7 which is very nice and convenient.- Room(semi-double) was a smaller than we expected but not too cramped. Just enough for two people.- Buffet breakfast consists of bread, soup with unlimited drinks/coffee. Not really the buffet that we expected but we loved the bread toppings that they had. You can order meals in their cafe but it's not included in the free breakfast.Just want to make one suggestion regarding the door near the counter of the hotel. Please make the door open on one side only if possible(on the side of the counter) because there was one time when one of the staff was rushing to go through the door and we were almost hit by it so maybe it would be better if it only opens and closes inward to avoid any accidents in the future :)Nevertheless, this is definitely a place we would easily go back to.",,Bon C,1,5.0

Many staffs speak many other languages well too. I stayed in both the single rooms and shared rooms. Both choices are good. Tvs in the single rooms. They clean the sheets every night. They have a washer and dryer on the bottom floor for 300 yen to clean and 100 yen to dry. The biggest positive of this hotel is it’s 24 hours and the cafe area is 24 hours. The cafe is quite popular among Japanese. Many come to the cafe even though they don’t stay at the hotel. You can have a coffee 2am if you wish. Free breakfast is good. Toast and coffee.

Even though I usually stay in full-service hotels, I really enjoyed this hostel due to the combination of affordability, convenience, and friendly service.The hostel is located conveniently near the Jimbocho subway station (5 min walk) on a pretty quiet side street. There is plenty of dining and convenience store options nearby, and you really get a native Tokyo feel. It is pretty easy to find with a little cafe up front. Once you walk in, you find a small check-in counter to your right where the front desk staff is friendly and efficient in getting you to your room and answering your questions. The hostel is located close to the imperial palace, yasukuni shrine, and not too far from Tokyo Station / Ginza.I got a single private room with a tiny window (didn't really overlook anything) - enough space for 1 person to not feel claustrophobic but not much bigger than a prison cell. The shared sinks on the floor were clean and easy to use. The showers were comfortable though basic, and there were plenty of bathrooms on each floor.

Clean and tidy. Rooms are incredibly tiny.BUT...the noise factor is unbearable. The walls in the rooms are super thin. There are these really loud communal hairdryers on every level directly outside the bedrooms (Not inside a bathroom but directly outsdie your bedroom door). People use them at all hours of the night with no respect for others trying to sleep. The noise is non-stop. I was repeatedly woken up every night several times at 2am, 3am, 4am, 5am by people using the hairdryers outside my room. The 2 weeks I stayed at the Sakura hotel, I never got more than 2 hours sleep without being woken up by the damn things.People in the rooms next door can be heard having parties. The walls are so thin you can actually follow the convesations. The hostel has a wonderful communal area on the ground floor where people can hang out 24/7 but despite this, people prefer to party in the rooms. So if you're in Japan for work or study and need some sleep or quite, this is not the place to stay.One night my lovely neighbour started playing his guitar in his room at 2am on a weekday. Great player but c'mon man, people need to sleep. For the entire 2 weeks at my stay at the Sakura I was sleep deprived. My only regret was not moving to another hotel sooner.

Instead, they are located in the center of the floor (2 female toilets, 2 male toilets, 2+2 sinks, 2 showers). I believe every floor has their own set. Although they are shared facilities, they are all clean and actually very pleasant to use. I never felt like it was uncomfortable or there was a lack of privacy. The shower is even behind two sets of doors. You may need to bring your own equipment for daily needs (ex. tooth brush, tooth paste, towels), but if you happen to forget anything, they either have it for sale or for rent. My favorite point would be the location. It's nice and quiet, the building was easy to find, and was very close to the train stations (Jimbocho station: Shinjuku, mita, hanzomon line). places like Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Akihabara are just 15 minutes away.

This time I came with two friends at the start of December for 4 nights. It was conveniently located a 2 min walk from Jimbocho Station and a convenience store was just up the road. Jimbocho is known as the used book district so it is makes an interesting area to take a walk around and peek in unique stores. All the staff were really friendly and helpful directing us to some Lonely Planet guides that were available for guests on loan and all spoke English really well. My friends and I had a triple single room which had bunk beds and a fold out with a futon on it. The fold out wasn't the most comfortable of things but the bunk beds were decent. Each came with a nice fluffy doona plus extra blankets and heating was also available which helped combat the winter chill. Yukatas were also provided and the rooms were turned down daily which surprised me but it was nice. There was even a small desk and tv in the room. We didn't use the TV but the desk was handy! On our floor there were 2 female toilets and 2 female showers and vice versa. We never had to wait to use them so it worked out well. Sinks were communal. Sound proofing was good but then we had a pretty quiet floor. Wifi was free and service was good. Breakfast was included, it mainly consisted of toast with butter and jam and soup plus tea and coffee. There were more options like eggs that one could pay for. We were a bit disappointed to find out that tea and coffee was only available during breakfast unless you wanted to pay for it. The downstairs sitting area is nice and open most of the time with a sheltered outdoor patio that I gathered was for smoking.

But on our other days of sightseeing, the night ended with us taking a short metro ride back to Jimbocho to crash at the hotel. In this respect, you could really stay anywhere in the city. So don't feel tied down to one area! Just look for the hotel that excites you the most because it's so easy to get around! I don't have an idea for the prices in other parts of the city but we were beyond satisfied with Sakura. Sakura Hotel Jimbocho is easy, clean, and fun! There were lots of other travelers; it reminded me of the nicest hostels I have stayed in in Europe. Really fun, communal vibe!

I've seen a lot of reviews saying how small their room was but I think people need to understand that this is part of the Tokyo experience and unless you have some serious money, all rooms you stay in will be small. You don't travel to another country to spend much time in your room anyway! The workers here were so nice and welcoming, allowing us to leave our bags before check in time while we wandered around. The breakfast was extensive and delicious, we met a lot of other people and many other Aussies. The 24hr Cafe and Front Desk is one of the best things about it. We could come and go at any time during the night and come back to welcoming smiling faces and yummy food and coffee.

It is very easy to get from Haneda (domestic or international terminals) to the Sakura with only one change at Mita (detailed on the hotel web site).

You can get a one or two day pass for just the Toei or pay more for both lines. Jimbocho has lines from both providers, but I only needed the Toei (610 yen Haneda to Jimbocho, or 800 yen for a one day pass).

My room also faced the wall of the building next door. The staff was very accommodating and moved me to a new room at my request.

It's THAT dark in there.I don't have any complaints- overall it was quite a good stay.

Our room was very small, even for two very slim persons it felt crowded sometimes. But I think it's fine, the smallness of the room didn't really bother me most of the time. Even though it's a cheap hotel, it's very clean. We got up pretty late everyday and met the nice cleaning ladies around 11am+. They do a great job cleaning the room every day. Everyday you get new yutakas and small towelettes. Since everyone on the same floor (there are 5 different floors) share bathroom and shower room, the dirtyness really depend on what kind of people you stay with at the moment. The first few days everyone kept the teethbrushing area very clean, but a few days later some american teenagers came and well... there were hair and make up remains in the sink. Also I discovered that there's no sound isolation really, most people try to keep a soft volume in their rooms but these teenagers didn't and you could hear everything they did. Since our room were just outside the sinks and were you brush your teeth, every night I could hear peoples teethbrushing routine, the spitting, gurgling and all. :( But I'm still satisfied with my stay at Sakura and would probably recommend it to people who wants a cheap, clean room. The staff were pretty nice and spoke good english.To travellers planning to stay here my tip is to NEVER eat at the hotel, it's expensive 500+yen for a bad meal, you can get 3-400yen much better meals at restaurants close to the A1 exit from Jimbocho st.

I have stayed in other rooms and this hasn't been the case with those.The shower and washing facilities are shared, however are usually kept very clean. I personally don't mind that so much as I've met a few interesting people whilst washing my face/brushing my teeth. It's not everyone's cup of tea, of course. The hotel's usual clientèle seem to be around the 20-30 year old range. There were a few older people, however. Although the age range staying there is quite young, they usually respect other guests.I recommend staying here to anyone who is either backpacking or anyone who sightseeing with friends. I can't comment on the couple of family side of the hotel, of course.On an additional note, the staff speak various languages. I know that one member of staff was able to speak four other languages besides Japanese.","Tokyo, Japan","Wenslock</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",0,4.0

It had a double bunker, a one-seater sofa, TV, heater, and just enough leg room to lay out 2 suitcases. It ain't big, doesn't have its own washroom, but it is cheap comparing to other Tokyo accommodation for just SGD60 per person per night (prices may be higher now).Shared amenitiesWashroom (read: basins, toilets, shower area) are all located in the center of each floor. All rooms surround the amenities area in the middle. To me, that's a really smart design as the toilet is literally outside your room, not like other hostels I know that you have to walk to the corner of each floor to reach the toilet. The washroom area is extremely functional and clean at all times.LocationMany who stayed appreciate the central location, but not the lack of activity around the area. First, you have to know that Jimbocho is considered a business district. Comparing to Singapore, it is like staying in the quiet part of Tanjong Pagar. It is extremely central, but come nightfall, it is definitely not a place near any entertainment nor food nor services. It is not easy to find it at night too. It is real quiet at night, so if you prefer somewhere with a more happening night life, pls choose Shinjuku area. Yet, no worries about getting hungry because just a few minutes walk away, just beside Red Cross House, there is a supermarket where you can get cheap meals/ drinks/ fresh fruits. A convenient store is nearby too. Another interesting observation - because it is in the business district, it gets terribly crowded when you are at the Jimbocho station in the morning rush hour. It was kind of fun to witness how the Tokyo work-goers are walking in extremely fast and yet orderly fashion.StaffMany of the staff speak very good English, perhaps because many of them are travelers too! We spoke to a few staff and realized that in exchange for cheaper (or free) long term stay, they work as reception during some days. Quite a cool concept, if you are considering to do the same :) And since they are also travelers/explorers, they are very resourceful in places to go. Chat with them!Stay again?Considering its cleanliness and the the idea of staying in a hostel where you can meet many other young travelers of different nationalities, exchanging notes of where to go, it is definitely somewhere I would stay again. However, if you are a young couple or family who wants more privacy and more accessibility, I suggest trying their much newer outlet - Sakura Shinjuku.","Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","maryyeo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam</strong>",405,4.0

Excellent location - just a five min walk from Jimbocho station. Jimbocho station lies on Shinjuku line (of coursen that goes to Shinjuku),Hanzomon line (Goes to Shibuya) and Mita Line.3. 24 hour cafe and bar4. Good security - your access card is changed everyday. That is a very good way of ensuring security for shared accomodation like dorms.5. Staff is super fluent in English - at times I wonder if they are Japanese!!6. Book swap - you can swap your books for the ones in their library. I did a swap too. It is a win-win for everybody. 7. Curtains on dorm beds - I didn't realize these curtains could help so much. Your sleep is not affected by people switching on lights, using cellphones etc. Of course, that doesn't stop the noise of slamming doors!!CONS:1. Ventilation is bad in basement dorm - if you plan to stay in the hotel during the day, then I would not recommend the basement dorms. However, if you are just going to use it for night's sleep like I did, then you are perfectly fine. Even if one of the guests has a contagious infection, you are affected.

This place would not have been my choice if I had been traveling alone, with a family, or with other adults.First, a few of the pros. It's actually in a good location. The subway line is very close (less than 5 minutes on foot), and of course, that gets you anywhere you want to go in Tokyo. The Imperial Palace is an easy and pleasant 20-minute walk--quicker to walk than take public transportation There are shops and restaurants galore, including the used book district and the sporting-goods (think, REI-type stuff) district very close by. Above all, the price can't be beat considering that it's Tokyo. Hotels are expensive in Tokyo, and budget travelers don't have a lot of great options. The rooms also have AC and TV. The international staff is friendly and helpful, and a small cafe on the first floor provides a place to relax over coffee or get a not-so-good meal.But there were plenty of cons. This is not a hotel. It's a very basic, no-frills, rough-around-the-edges hostel. The rooms are small (but this is typical in Japan anyway, even in the nicest hotels, so really isn't unique). Some rooms have single beds, others have bunk beds. Showers, toilets, and sinks are all separate from the rooms and from one another, which means when you step outside your room, you're running into people brushing their teeth, etc. at the sinks. Everything looks and feels old and worn-out. The ""breakfast"" is instant soup and toast. When you have a city filled with world-class food, the cafe is definitely something to avoid. And if you're not interested in being surrounded by sometimes-loud 20-somethings, this isn't your place.There are better affordable places to stay in Tokyo.",michigan,"eigerdreamer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>michigan</strong>",50,2.0

Once I accepted that, the rooms here are great. Small, but I only planned to sleep or sit in mine, so adequate for my purposes. Quiet, tidy, internet in the rooms is free (and WiFi in my case), snacks seem to be available all day, simple breakfast included (all of these things cost a packet inTokyo, so if the hotel provides them and you want them then it makes the room value even better). The location is also great. Tokyo is huge and unless you need to be in a specific area, this place is well located to get to anywhere by subway or rail, and is in easy walking distance of the Imperial Palace and you can stroll on to downtown.Given that Tokyo can be a bit of a culture shock, the true asset of this hotel is the staff. Even before I got on the plane I had been sent directions from Narita Airport to the hotel in excellent English. I reckoned I could have found it by myself, but it would have taken a lot longer - their directions led me there without delay.The squad at reception speak superb English and are amazingly helpful. I wanted to go to the Ghibli museum and it was going to be difficult as they only accept tickets bought and collected in advance and in Japan this has to be done on the internet and then collected from a vending machine in a specific chain of convenience shops. The vending machine system would be impossible to negotiate for a non-japanese speaker. Not only did the receptionist guy sort out the details on the internet, he then left the desk and walked with me to one of these stores near the hotel to sort out the vending machine for me. This was really beyond the call of duty and the main reason I am writing this review - I have never been moved to write a review of a hotel before, but these guys tipped the balance and if anyone else had to find a place to stay I would be doing them a dis-service if I didn't tell them to stay here.",ireland,"murnauontour</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>ireland</strong>",67,5.0

That went out the window. I recommend using a sleeping bag as you get a very small duvet which for my 5ft height only covered me from my shoulders to my ankles. My husband was freezing most of the night, he's around 6ft.

Breakfast downstairs was simple but cheap, unlimited coffee/tea refills and toast once you'd paid your small fee. Free wireless access downstairs was also a big bonus, and something we really appreciated.It's located close to a few subway stations, and fairly centrally placed, not far from the Imperial Palace East Gardens.

You get what you pay for, however. The rooms are clean, but very small (only fits a bed and enough room to walk past it), even for Japan. Toilets and showers are shared, which is not so bad as they were cleaned daily. The wash basins are right out in the corridor, however. It was pretty weird to stand there brushing one’s teeth right next to another guest. Towels are not included but can be rented (almost for free, merely 100 yen per towel).We chose Sakura Hotel because it is called a hotel and I dislike hostels. It felt much more like a hostel than a hotel however, so the name is rather misleading. For a hostel, it was ok.The staff speaks English, and is really helpful and service minded. They seemed slightly undermanned at times though. There is a café/bar, but it was unmanned most of the time, which meant that you’d have to call for the person at the front desk to come and take your order. He/she would have to leave the front desk (possibly with people waiting in line) just to make your cappuccino or whatever. Felt kind of weird. There is a basic breakfast served in the morning (included in the price if you stay in a single room, otherwise costing a mere 315 yen). It is very basic (tea/coffee and toast), but it is nice to get something before going out sightseeing. The location of the hotel is excellent in terms of transportation. Although there is not much happening in the Jimbocho area, the hotel is only a few minutes' walk from Jimbocho station, from which you can easily get to more interesting neighborhoods. The subway system is easy to understand. Just make sure to get a pasmo card, and you won’t have to worry about transfers and costs. All in all, Sakura Hotel is a fine place to stay if you are on a tight budget and don’t mind staying at a hostel. For my own part, if I had known how low prices actually were in Tokyo, I would have paid up to stay at a real hotel instead.","Stockholm, Sweden","arevan_1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",84,3.0

It was very difficult for me to pick a hotel as Tokyo is such an enourmous place but I liked Sakura's website and the price was right for a budget traveler like myself.I arrived Tokyo by train from Nagoya, and getting around first with a big backbag in July heat in rush hour Tokyo was rather challenging. Despite of the instructions I had printed out (which were not very specific as I trusted I could find the place as it was close to the station) I had major difficulties finding Sakura at first. I managed to get to the Jimbocho metro station and although Sakura was very close to it, I almost gave up and slept on the street instead :) The Japanese aroud either knew nothing, spoke no English or were pointing at all different directions!Anyway after finding Sakura I had a friendly welcome and got my room. It was teeny tiny but I didn't anticipate spending much time there anyway. There was just enough room for a single bed and walking past it. The room also had tv. The window was covered because of some construction they were making so I saw no light at all. It felt like staying in a closet but I didn't mind too much although I would have appreciated some daylight. I got a hair drier from the desk, and the air conditioning worked well. In July in Tokyo air condition is a must... The showers and bathrooms were shared and in the same floor. They were always clean and nice. The room had a rope and slippers so you could just put them on going to shower. Breakfast included to the private room rate and Sakura had a nice and often busy cafe-bar downstairs to have it. Basically it was toast and coffee, but that was good enough and it is always nice to get something before leaving. There was also internet but using it was very expensive.Overall, I had a pleasant stay in Sakura. It was far from luxury but for a little budjet hotel it did its job well.

The front desk is manned 24 hours and the cafe is 24 hours but I didn't observe anyone using it really late at night apart from using the internet.There's a few computers for internet use, the charge is ￥100 per 10 minutes which isn't great (compared to the fantastic internet cafe prices in Tokyo) but fine if you just want to check your email.The showers and toilet facilities are shared which I was apprehensive about at first but there were never any problems with this and they were cleaned daily. Good water pressure in the showers. Towel hire is ￥100 which I didn't think was very good since it is called a hotel rather than a hostel, I feel that if you have a private room, with the extra you're paying compared to the dormitories you really could do with getting a couple of towels included.Breakfast was ￥315 per person but all you get is toast. There's a loaf of bread and a toaster and little packets of butter and jam. There's a large selection of tea which is included as breakfast and also packets of dried soup granules. The breakfast wasn't BAD as such but not really worth paying for. Would be fine if it was complimentary.Good location right next to the Jimbocho subway line where you can get to anywhere you want to in Tokyo once you work out the subway system! If you stand around any station looking confused then you're basically guaranteed to have someone try to help you and then you'll figure out what you're doing. God bless the person that decided to put the subway lines in romaji as well as kanji!Overall this was a nice place to stay on a budget.

A ""Continental Breakfast"" (which I believe is Japanese for Toast and orange juice) is provided in the mornings to guests.
