Even one of the tours to Mt Fuji has its pickup point at this hotel. Breakfast was good and I was happy with the Japanese dishes that was offered every morning, be it the Mitso soup, the rice porridge or the steamed rice. Smoked salmon was always a delight and so were the variety of eggs that had been freshly prepared. The room was good, but with a street view it would have even much better.

Last year I stayed in Shinjuku. I thoroughly enjoyed staying in the Ginza neighborhood. All of the convenience of Shinjuku with a bit less craziness. So, location was fine. And staff were uniformly kind and efficient. But property feels tired. I tend to prefer ""modern concept"" hotels, & this place is anything but. It felt like an airport hotel in the US. In the 1990s. Not something located in one of the world's premier, upscale neighborhoods. 1st room I checked into lacked a safe. Really, Marriott? You can't spring for safes for all your guest rooms? I opted to upgrade at my expense to higher tiered room that came with safe -- was my only option. Also, carpets. I LOATHE carpeting in hotel rooms. It just feels WRONG. Much prefer hard floors. Thankfully it's going the way of the dodo bird in an increasing percentage of the world's hotels, but, alas, not this one. And, although I'm not a zealot on the climate change issue, I've found most hotels in Asia these days require guests to deposit key cards into ""power slots"" to get electricity. This cuts down on energy waste, and (I've found, at least) is highly convenient, because it makes it easier to turn off the lights and appliances prior to leaving. Finally, there's construction going on. I didn't hear any noise, but, beware when you book you might not be so lucky. I believe the project in part of an expansion of the property.

Considering that there were much better (and cheaper) offers in Ginza, and that Marriott had the rate on their website advertised for around 400 usd per night, I figured that, as a way to show loyalty to them, considering we were going to stay for a full week, we found a rate on expedia for 250 USD / night - This was a mistake, because apparently if you book anywhere outside Marriott App or Website, your stay does not count - at all. It's like you were never there, so, either pay their rates (which, while in Tokyo are never cheap anyway) or, you're a nobody... In other words, if you're a bonvoy member, you have to be chained to bonvoy itself. Now, the hotel... Arriving from the Narita shuttle, the hotel lobby is pretty dark and dingy, like a 1970s movie, looks like it has not been changed in a long time, of course, on check in and being told that our status does not count, we get assigned to a double room, which are smaller than the walk in closet in other hotels. View ? You're in Ginza, you get the fantastic view of the construction site next door followed by rude staff down in the bar and the restaurant - why ? because by sitting in the common area next to the bar, you're inconveniencing them outside the hours (a big first in Japan) - and they don't hesitate to ask you to leave or not use the common area outside the serving hours. When serving, if you have a person who looks Japanese sitting with you, the server will turn to them and take the order from them despite speaking English, (quite embarassing if the person with you is a guest !!!!!) You're better off at the Denny's across the street, at least they will serve you drinks (not with a smile, but nonetheless) Breakfast was kind of OK, and the couple of times we used roomservice the food arrived hard and dry, very unpleasant with of course the bed being the only place to set it down (that's how small the rooms are). In short, I don't recommend this hotel, there are plenty of much better offers in and around Ginza, I'm just going to stick with other brands that take customer service much more seriously, and I recommend you do so too.

When I arrived at 10, I was told that my room wasn't ready, which was an unpleasant surprise, especially since I had purposely vacated my other hotel in Tokyo and made a long trip over to the Courtyard. I was asked to wait until 1130 for my room to be ready. When I came back to check in at 11 (being hopeful), I wasn't given a room upgrade, which is usual for Titanium Elite. Disappointing, but I know I'm not entitled to it based on availability. When I asked about complimentary breakfast, which is usually included for the status at all Marriott properties, I was told they do not offer that benefit to anyone of any status. The few positives is that the rooms are spacious and they offer nice yukatas. The other positive is that when I gave them feedback + a recording of the air conditioner sounding like a vacuum whenever it turned off, they offered to promptly to put me in another room, but since I was staying only one additional night, I declined, and asked them to quiet the AC if possible.

My room was small but functional. They had a full coffee and tea service [replenished daily] however there were a limited amount of electrical outlets in the room overall. My first night I had no heat at all and had to call down for a blanket as well as for a heater which arrived immediately [I wonder why] I ended up using this heater for the entire time I was there. My room safe was not working and I had to ask for another one-this was promptly replaced the following day. The shower had no protective decals on the surface of the tub [dangerous for the elderly or poorly coordinated who could fall] and the shower liner was so thin and flimsy and would stick to your body which was annoying while showering. On a positive note, the electrical outlets were American as well as Japanese. There was also an iron, ironing board, hair dryer, a refrigerator but no microwave but a heated toilet and a bidet. My favorite feature was the Nespresso coffee maker with pods which was great in the morning before breakfast. We got the breakfast [Western and Asian options] as part of our package and this was comprehensive and delicious and the staff was extremely accommodating filling our coffee cups at every turn.

This Marriott Courtyard doesn’t pretend to be anything it’s not. It’s a Bonvoy-centric property planted in a quieter area of Ginza. Not surprisingly, it leans to the West, but maintains a nice touch of the Japanese hospitality and efficiency. There are always plenty of staff that absolutely go out of their way to be friendly and helpful, but never fawning or intrusive. Japanese hospitality is always good, but this is great. The rooms are good sized for Japan, incredibly quiet, and the bathroom is well appointed with all the usuals you’d expect at a Courtyard. It’s well priced considering the location. Restaurant has an excellent buffet with both Eastern and Western fare, including cooked to order eggs and waffles. They also serve lunch and dinner, but I didn’t partake, so can’t comment. If you’re looking for predictable service and personable staff in a nicely appointed well-priced property in the Ginza area, this is worth considering.

I had a king room. It was quite spacious for Tokyo, definitely will be comfortable for 2 persons. It looked exactly like their web-site pictures. There is a mini bar (with a somewhat limited selection of drinks and snacks), it housed my dinner left overs well. There is a hot water kettle, hint: may be used for instant noodles (not provided), as well as tea and coffee (provided). There are two subway stations within walking distance - Higashi-ginza (5 min) and Ginza (9 min). The hotel provides a mobile phone in the room for the time of your stay (free of charge) that you can take out and use for navigation, phone calls (limited countries, but US is on the list), and general data surfing - very helpful when you don't get the international data plan.

Wifi was fast and easy. 2 thumbs up.The complimentary mobile phone was helpful as well for making local calls when out and about.Note to management: Because this hotel has both English (not a transliteration of the Japanese name) and Japanese names, there can be some issues when telling drivers where to go. On the left of the entrance in Japanese it says 銀座東武ホテル (Ginza Tobu Hotel), but on the right of the entrance it says Courtyard Tokyo Ginza Hotel. This can lead to missunderstandings as about half of the drivers I encountered knew the hotel only as the Ginza Tobu Hotel, or just the Tobu Hotel. Perhaps mentioning this to visitors could help avoid any confusion. Handing out a taxi card with the room key might help.Also, when leaving the subway there is a sign, but without proper English (for example ""you are here"" is only written in Japanese - 現在地). Not helpful unless you can read Japanese. Also, while the closest exit is A1, and the placard is placed near A1, it shows it as Higashi Ginza exit A2 - not really helpful. Road names etc are all in Japanese. Before the Olympics, it would be important to remedy these issues and install appropriate signage.The airport bus from Narita stops at the hotel - which could be useful after a long journey to someone using public transportation.Overall a wonderful stay - will definitely return.","New York City, New York","MaikKubo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",139,5.0

We were checked in by Ms. Minako K. Her english ability & cheerful professional attitude made check-in very pleasant. We found the room to be spacious & well designed especially in a Tokyo location. The view was unremarkable but what to expect in a densely packed city! As part of our accommodation package, we were given the daily breakfast buffet. The food choices reflected the cosmopolitan nature of the hotel with both western & Japanese food well represented. I could not help noticing the range of languages spoken by the guests which made we wonder if we were truly in Japan.The downsides are minor but for Japan worth noting that the hotel does not have a public bath or onsen and the fitness center is quite small.The hotel has a free pocket size walking/running map from the hotel to either Hibiya Park or the Imperial Palace grounds. This is a better alternative than the treadmill. The closest subway entrance is near the Mitsui Millenium Hotel.

Walking distance to the famous shopping and dining areas of Ginza as well as the Shimbashi and Ginza stations. If you’re planning to walk to the hotel, use the Ginza exit- it’s a shorter walk than Shimbashi. As we’ve come to expect the Marriott brand didn’t disappoint. However, if there’s one opportunity I would advise this hotel is to do a better job in managing their guests’ expectations. We arrived Monday and asked the concierge to make a reservation to one of the popular sushi restaurants in Tokyo. I gave Wen (she’s the concierge) a few options for our availability because I know it’s hard to get in. She promised to call the restaurant. Tuesday came, no update. Wednesday came, still no update. Thursday mid-day, no update (our flight back to SFO is Friday). I finally had to follow-up with the front desk only to learn that my account had been noted with “they called, no answer from restaurant”. I would’ve appreciated if I was informed right away so we could’ve made other plans. I could’ve gone to another restaurant that I also wanted to try.

We were moved after 3 days (of a 5 day stay), but by then all of our clothes smelt of smoke.The room, like most Japanese Hotels was small, but this was made worse by the fact that we were given 3 single beds- which made things even tighter.Pillows were quite small and not particularly comfortable.I am conscious that our review is lower than most, and can think of two reasons why:We stayed during the Sakura season, which meant the hotel was expensive, we were paying over USD$500 per night, but the hotel definitely doesn't provide value for that price. I imagine people rating the hotel a 5 paid much less.People expect Japanese Hotel rooms to be small, so don't mark it down. However I have stayed in hotels with small rooms before, but they have been very well designed, for instance the CitizenM Hotel in New York- the rooms there are much smaller than here, but the design is so good that it doesn't feel it. This hotel has very little design consideration, the lobby and bar areas aren't particularly welcoming with little atmosphere, and the rooms are a bog standard design.","Singapore, Singapore","NeilBowyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",102,3.0

We traveled throughout Japan for 14 days and this is the only hotel I had a problem with my allergies. I noticed there was a lot of mold in the bathroom... in sort of hidden places. The bathroom was barely big enough for one person to stand in... you could only just turn around in-place. The ceiling was so low in the shower that my husband could not wash his hair without bending down because his hands did not fit between his head and the ceiling. We did not like that the showers had shower curtains. The sheets were also very scratchy. We were expecting the standard, soft Marriott bedding. The carpeting was very old. The room was just not comfortable to us and felt a little icky.On the day of our check out...they started doing construction work on the rooms across the hall from ours. We had to step over plastic sheeting and the smell was terrible. I felt like my health might be in danger from whatever fumes were coming from the construction. It seems like they could have waited a day until we were out of the room and not filled those rooms until the construction was over. We were checking out on a Sunday.We are platinum members, so we stay in almost exclusively Marriotts. We had two rooms... when we checked in, they wanted to change our king bed to two twins, but luckily we did get a king room. The second room, a two twin room, was not ready still at 5pm...which seemed a little unacceptable. Maybe the hotel was full, but we did not get upgraded in anyway in spite of being Platinum members.The staff was all really friendly. The buffet breakfast was pretty good with even an omelet bar, fresh fruit, a cappuccino maker, standard Japanese breakfast items, etc. The hotel is close to the Higashi-Giza station, exit A1, on the Hibiya and Asukasa lines...so, the location was good. It was also nice to get two bottles of water per room per day because it was so hot. However, I don't think I would stay at this hotel again just because it was way too expensive for what the room was. During our trip to Japan, we stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Tokyo and that was amazing. Just before staying at this Courtyard, we were staying at the St. Regis in Osaka which was 5,000 Yen less than this Courtyard and I think it was one of the nicest hotel I've ever stayed in. This hotel is ok, but really the value was not there and because of the other reasons I mentioned... I rate it as poor.","Orange County, CA","mLaurie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, CA</strong>",6,2.0

Actually it also takes around 10 minutes walk from JR Shinbashi station, but if you take metro I think it is quite close to Ginza East Station, so it all depends on what transport you take. It is also convenient because the hotel is the pick up and drop off point of the airport limousine bus to Haneda and Narita airport. There are also lots of stores and shopping malls nearby, especially there are one mega store and one supermarket which are opened for 24 hours nearby.We arrived at 11:00 and left the baggage first. Then we went back to JR station to catch the Shinkansen. Not much people wait for check in so we can do it quickly. We found the staff there are more international, compared to other hotels I stayed in Japan.We came back at around 1100pm and most restaurants are closed. They offer us the high floor room and the welcome drink voucher but unluckily the bar is already closed. The room is not big but fair enough. They also gave us welcome amenities including nuts, ice cream, fruit and cheese because of the member status, which were quite generous as other Marriott hotels, even including JW marriott only offer 1-2 type amenities while they offer both of us, which means 4 types of amenities in total.After 15 minutes the amenities arrive. I expect those are cut fruits and cut cheese, instead, they are unpeeled whole fruit and packed cheese. Since we are not that keen on eating during night time, we are fine with them. Bedding is also good. But I cant find the humidifier which is normally installed in Japanese hotel. We had breakfast on the next morning in the cafe. Choices are great and I am impressed by their live cooking station, including the soup noodle, egg and pancake station. The taste are great and service is good too.We left early to go to other places. Overall the staying experience is good. With the prime location, the rate of this hotel is not low.

There's a direct train to and from both Haneda and Narita airports and it's also an airport limousine bus hotel (although timings to and from Haneda are few and far between). It's around 3 mins walk to Higashi-Ginza station (2 lines) and about 8 minutes walk to Ginza station (3 lines). Higashi-Ginza even offers direct trains to Yokohama (2 every hour). The main Ginza shopping stretch is just two streets away and there are plenty of restaurants nearby especially steak restaurants such as the famous Gyu-An. We were allowed to check-in at 10am, which is almost unheard of in Tokyo.The hotel itself isn't the newest but the room itself is fairly modern although certain touches are obviously old though well maintained. For example, we had a National brand hairdryer and torch, both yellowed with age although working fine, and that brand ceased to exist quite long ago.Room is of a good size for Japan, beds are comfortable and windows can be opened (huge plus in my book). However, the hotel does seem to have some power downtime once in awhile where electricity gets cut off past 2am till about 6am, so do finish all you need to do by then.Marriott Elite Gold and above members get a free scrumptious breakfast spread and drink coupons for the lounge. I'd recommend the orange juice in the lounge. Freshly squeezed and one of the best I've ever tasted.We got a really good rate for our stay so it was great value for us, but if you're paying the rack rates, the same amount could probably get you some place better.

The staff are very nice and helpful with a very good level of English. The only real downsides. The breakfast area reminds be of an office canteen.

Once you overcome the size issue, the hotel is amazing. We picked Marriott as Americans because we know they understand our US-centric mentality. We could communicate in English, and the hotel felt familiar in a strange land. I am over-explaining this point, but if Japan is foreign to you, this location will help ease your transition.The location is great. Close enough to 2 different metro stations on separate lines to get anywhere you want in the city with 1 or less transfers. The shopping in Ginza puts Chicago's Michigan Ave., New York's 5th Ave. and even Rodeo Drive to shame. You can walk to all of the shopping these three areas have to offer and then some from this hotel. The value of the inventory in new Ginza 6 mall which just opened, is probably larger than the GDP of most small countries.The breakfast was outstanding and not to be missed. If your room rate includes breakfast, be sure and take advantage of it every day. It is well worth it.In terms of logistics, the airport limo-bus drops off directly at this hotel which is a plus.

The availability of a shuttle to the airport for our return flight was another reason.Check in was quick and efficient. The room was much smaller than what we had expected from a Marriott. However, we were now accustomed to the idea of small rooms, hence it did not bother us too much. Our room was tucked into a side corridor, and there wasn't much of a view. Since there are buildings all around, I do not think that any room would come with a view. Our luggage had not arrived when we checked in. The bell captain’s desk was manned by Anna. What she lacked in English, she more than made up with her sincerity and her ability to appease our concerns. Many phone calls later, using the few words at her command and a lot of (I guess) Google translate, she informed us that the luggage would be delivered by the next morning. What impressed us was that she went the extra mile to allay our fearsIn Mr. Ricardo Sasaki, who mans the concierge desk, the Marriott has one of their best assets. Fluent in English, and a very pleasing demeanour, he has a ton of information at his fingertips and the ability to help you plan the day around Tokyo. Breakfast, included in our package, was excellent. The pancakes were fluffy. They have this quaint habit of bringing the freshly baked croissant around and while they are flaky enough, the freshly baked ones just melt in the mouth.The main streets of Ginza are barely a 5 minute walk. Tsukiji market is about 10 minutes away, while the Hamarikiyu gardens are also about the same distance. Shimbashi station is about 10 minutes away, while Ginza is about 10 minutes Hence it is quite centrally located.

Booked 3 rooms as online reservation indicated that each room could only accommodate 2 occupants. This was troublesome since our children are ages 2-13 years old. Worse, this maximum 2-occupant-per-room-regardless-of-age-of children policy was confirmed by the Marriott toll-free customer service agent. Fortunately, the property responded to our email when prodded that our 2-year old was not considered an adult and even offered to set up a baby cot in any of the 3 rooms. In truth, we found the 2 king rooms spacious enough for the 7 of us but did not cancel the 3rd room anymore. Based on this experience, this property does not come across as family-with-young children-friendly. Note: other reviews in TripAdvisor did not mention similar issues regarding children staying with them in the room. I do not understand why ours was different. In case we would consider staying here again, it would be wiser to communicate directly to the hotel vs general Marriott hotline. The good points: complimentary bottled water and Marriott chocolate thins, tv program with English channels, good bed and pillows and strong shower. The service from front desk to concierge was warm, smiling and professional. They arranged take-out breakfast for us when we informed them that our flight was at 9am and even made sure food contained no allergens. They also gave excellent recommendations on Kobe beef restaurants and ramen places within a block around the hotel. Accessibility wise, it is a good 4 blocks away from the main street (shops and train station) or 8-10-minute walk when walking with young children. A convenience store is on the same block as hotel property. Tip: book with breakfast. The choices may not be as widespread as Shangri-la but the quality is crazy good, especially the pastries.

The hotel location is superb, within easy walking distance to the Kabuki-za, Tsukiji fish market and Ginza shopping district. Multiple Tokyo Metro subway stations are close by.The hotel itself is relatively old, but has been refurbished to a high standard along with its rebranding under the Marriott name, although you will notice some minor faults which betray its age (some worn carpets and furnishings, old-fashioned hotel features). None were particularly troubling, however.I stayed in one of their modest ""16 square metre"" rooms and I was pleased with the room, which had a very comfortable king single mattress, modern TV and was well maintained. I enjoyed having adequately bright lighting, something some hotels don't seem to understand is required for proper work and reading. The room is very small by Western standards (be warned - there are even smaller 13 square metre rooms!), but for the price I paid (around JPY 18,000) and the location, it is pretty reasonable. You can choose a much larger room but with a corresponding significant increase in price, so you do get what you pay for!Some minor niggles - the bathroom had the usual Japanese ""washlet"" toilet seat but it was rather old strangely enough, not heated. I wasn't sure if this was because the seat was broken or it was just an old model. Occasionally the smell of cigarettes in the corridor and other parts of the hotel were overpowering and very unpleasant. I really hope major hotel chains like Marriott eventually embrace a 100% No Smoking policy for ALL of their rooms, for the comfort, amenity and safety of its customers.The view out of the 10th floor (which is the second highest level) was not particularly interesting, but this didn't trouble me as I don't generally spend hours by my hotel window. If you really want a hotel with a view, choose one that is much higher!I would definitely recommend this hotel as a convenient location to stay close to Ginza. It doesn't quite live up to a 5-Star hotel (like the Park Hyatt or Shangri La) -- it is more like a really excellent 4-Star hotel.

It is in the heart of the Ginza district in it just doesn't get any better than this. The service is absolutely outstanding. And yes, they do speak English here; this is very helpful when you need assistance with things such as learning how to maneuver the various subway stations, or, when you're lost in the Ginza district and you need assistance on how to get back to the hotel.They offer free breakfast every morning for elite members. This is by far the post extensive breakfast that I have experienced and I've stayed at the Marriott's around the world. They definitely take pride in customer service at this location. Not only did I receive free breakfast each morning, along with free Wi-Fi, I also received a nice welcom gift. This is pure class and the United States Marriott location should take note.The breakfast was awesome! They offered Western breakfast selections as well as Asian fair. The omelette station was wonderful; there, you could order eggs Benedict, scrambled eggs, etc. Next to the omelette station where pancakes and waffles. There was also an assortment fresh fruit yogurt and a bread station. I always opted for the Asian breakfast which included miso soup, rice, a Ramen bar, and dim sum to name a few. The coffee maker was always popular. There you could choose from a latte, cappuccino, café Meastowe, espresso, or a blend. The coffee was always delicious and was a great way to start the day.The rooms are comfortable and appropriately sized. Many reviews indicate that the rooms are small. I did not find that this was the case. While the bathroom is slightly on the small size, everything is more than manageable. The only downside to this hotel is that they do not offer shuttle service to and from the airport. I understand that Narita is over an hour away, so perhaps a shuttle would be unreasonable for that airport. However, Haneda is less than 20 minutes away, so shuttle service shouldn't be that much to ask for; especially, given the number of loyal Marriott members that stay at this hotel. Having to pay $250 for transportation to Narita is excessive. Further $80 for transportation to Haneda is also excessive. Yes, the airport limousine bus is an economical choice at roughly US $8.00. However, they only offered two times to Haneda which did not work for my particular airport itinerary. I can only assume that this happens quite a bit.Dear management, I hope you'll consider offering shuttle transportation to and from the airport and order to and from the nearby metro stations just like the other Marriott hotels in the Tokyo.","San Diego, California","JetsettinDiva08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",31,4.0

I don't understand why the hallways are cool but the room is so hot. I complained to the front desk but they could not do much but tell me to turn off the air conditioner since it will blow hot air and put a fan in my room. I will never again stay here again if it is not during the summer when the air conditioner is on.

I thought I would get that out of the way before I jump into the reason I am writing this review.The Bars, down stairs and lobby, are hilariously hysterical over the use of drink coupons given to Elite Status Guests at the hotel. There is no ""club"" at this hotel so in turn they will give you ""coupons for drinks and breakfast"". However if you are going to use the drink coupons apparently you MUST tell the waitstaff and bartender before you order. At the bar the use of a coupon relegates you to the cheapest draft beer or whatever is under the ""bottom shelf"" of liquor. The bartender pointed at a few dusty bottles of hooch when I asked him what kind of drink I could get besides a beer. This was of course AFTER I had ordered a beer, tried to pay with the coupon, and received an angry lecture about telling him I had a coupon prior to ordering next time.At the ""Wine Bar"" on the main floor it is the same comical antics. If you use a coupon you are not worthy of the ""free nuts"" that comes with a beer ordered by a human (aka paying cash). The ladies there made a loud and obvious effort to determine whether the scoundrel (aka Folks that stay with Marriott, A LOT) in front of them were using coupons. If no coupon the attitude was pleasant and helpful, if coupon then the service was brisk, cold, and a ""drink quickly and leave"".I know these are small details but I think it speaks to a larger view of the hotel. They, Tokyo Ginza Courtyard, staff are there to squeeze every dollar out of their guests. They are grudgingly providing Corporate Benefits and services to frequent Marriott guests. It gives the whole place a cheap and shady feel and it makes you wonder about where else they are squeezing costs to make a buck. I mean how much does it cost to wash and change the sheets and is it worth the investment to them, ya know?I travel about two weeks out of the month in ASIA and have stayed predominately at Marriott properties. Some are OK and some are not. Its a real shame the owners (or management) of this particular Ginza Marriott properties have decided a shakedown is more profitable than an investment in attracting frequent ""high mileage"" guests.","Dallas, Texas","RobH2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",6,3.0

First night was awful since we didn’t get our usual upgrades, there were 4 of us and we got a room with 2 twin beds. Mind you these are not double let alone queen-sized bed, it’s twin-sized! With much difficulties we passed the night, perhaps from being too tired after 3 hours Shinkansen ride from Osaka and arriving pretty late at the hotel. However we did not let the disappointing room stopped us from waking up at 3 am and went to Tsukiji only to find out it’s Wednesday and they are closed! Well, we went again the next day and successfully partook in what we came here for, the Tsukiji Tuna auction. But if we didn’t stay here, there’s no way we would’ve done that. Anyway after morning naps, I spoke to the staff in the reception and she kindly offered to upgrade us to a larger room on a higher floor as well as give us a roll-away bed without extra charge. Yay! Kudos to the super friendly front desk staff, this was easily the best experience. The breakfast is pretty good, with good selection of Asian and Western fares, although the selection is not as good as Courtyard Shin-Osaka’s. The restaurant area itself is not too big, mind you this is Tokyo where everything is small, crampy and expensive, so yes, the hotel is actually doing pretty good given all these disadvantages. Everything is on the ground floor, unlike Marriott Marquis where I’m not even sure where the lobby is. So again, the hotel has a very nice and convenient setting that doesn’t require you to climb up 8 levels only to check in. The hotel is very close to, I hope I got this right, Higashi-Ginza Station which is a subway station on the Toei Asakusa Line. In other words, this is the one of the Marriott properties in a strategic location (Ginza) that is within a train ride from Narita. We scheduled our trip to end at this hotel with the understanding we could directly go to Narita from here, and it didn’t disappoint. After 3 nights stay, the day of our departure is here. We woke up at 5.30, went downstairs for breakfast with our luggage and then caught the 7.15 Toei-Asakusa subway which turn into the train heading for Narita. There’s no need to change train and it only costs us 1300 yen for adults and a little over 600 for kids. Perfect ending to our Japan trip.

They refused to seat us inside even though the restaurant was COMPLETELY empty, claiming all tables were reserved. I was with two other colleagues from the US and even they felt awkward at the treatment. It's relatively common in Tokyo to find signs at restaurants and establishments with signs saying Japanese Only.

We were in Japan for two weeks and this was the best breakfast we had - in fact this was the best hotel we stayed in.One slight drawback, which won't affect my overall 'score' as it is just a personal niggle. The lounge bar closes at nine, which means if you want a pre-bed drink- of any nature- you have to go down to the bar one floor down. One floor down and forty years behind the times - this was a real throwback to the seventies (even down to the Bee Gees music played).

Upon arrival however, the hotel assigned me in a twin room, saying that 'we give you a bigger room' as extra privilige. Ok, I thanked. Upon arrival in the room, I found it not spacious as I have expected. Everything is too cramped with two beds, chairs and coffee table are squeezed in the room (I am comparing the space with my hotel in Kyoto). Since I was tired from long day tour and all my luggage have been put in the room, I just gave it a try to adapt to the space given.

The staff went above and beyond in every category possible to make my stay a very memorable one. Originally I had gone back and forth between staying at the Marriott, Prince Sakura Tower (Autograph collection), Courtyard at Tokyo Station or Courtyard Ginza. After calling to speak with someone over the phone at the Marriott and Tokyo Station, it was clear that English would be a challenge for communication. When I had spoken with the representative at Ginza, I immediately knew that it would be the hotel to stay at due to the level of effective communications and I was not ever disappointed at the hotel from arrival through to departure. I also personally like to walk places and found Courtyard Ginza great with excellent restaurants near by, as well as a 2 minute walk from the train station and tons of high end shopping options. You also have a Lawson's (convenience store) and a Tully's coffee shop almost next door. There is a Denny's across the street but I wouldn't travel to Tokyo to go to Denny's personally. Cabs were plentiful, however make sure you take the hotel business card with you as many Taxi drivers don't speak English but once I had shown them the hotel address card, all was well. I didn't have a chance to arrange tours prior to arriving in Tokyo however the staff was able to help set up two day tours for my son and I that were both excellent. As a Platinum member, I was very pleased to have breakfast coupon's for my son and I each day. The breakfast was excellent as well as the service and options. We were also given drink coupons which made it very nice as well. I was upgraded on arrival and then upgraded again later in the week regarding bed type request.

I preface my review saying simply because I don't want to provide a false reality based upon my own personal review of this hotel.To start, everyone at the hotel was beyond accommodating. In typical Japanese fashion, we were very well taken care of. The room we had was larger than another a room I stayed in at the Courtyard Tokyo Station previously. The rooms still aren't large but I knew that upon arriving. The breakfast buffet was nothing mind-blowing however really good and everything my wife and I needed each morning. Being Platinum at Marriott it was free every morning as well. The Bar in B1 was also very Japanese, relatively quiet and all of the service staff were so kind. We hung out here many of nights just to relax and talk. We couldn't get wi-fi in the bar so it forced my wife and I to talk to one another which was very enjoyable.Outside of the hotel, the location was perfect!! It's a short cab ride, or reasonable walk, to Roppongi, short walk to Tokyo Station, the Emperor's Palace and a short cab ride to Shibuya (which was our favorite part of this trip). Anything you want to do is within walking distance! It's also a short walk to the Tsukiji Fish Market (if you are willing to wake up earlier enough, 3am, to witness the huge fish auction).Overall, when we go back to Tokyo, we will stay at this hotel again for sure.",Pittsburgh,"SteelersFan92</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh</strong>",2,5.0

We could not have been more pleased with our stay at the Courtyard Ginza hotel! First of all, if you take the airport limousine bus from Narita, the courtyard is the final stop on the route, so we were literally dropped at the front door of the hotel! How is that for convenience after a 13 hour flight?! We were greeted by hotel staff outside and they accompanied us to the check in desk. A lady named May checked us in and she was ever so helpful and sweet! We had many questions about tourist destinations and the hotel itself and she was a wealth of information and made us feel like we were the only guests staying there. She offered our two young boys a treat of pop and they got to pick out a snack! how nice! Being a Marriott rewards member, we received 2 free drink coupons and free hot buffet breakfast for our entire stay- this was amazing!! This is a serious perk and I was pleasantly surprised to receive it! The rooms were clean and comfortable with mini bars and kimonos! The hotel is in the Ginza district with high end shopping; just a few blocks away was a street of nothing but quaint restaurants, so dining options were abundant. Everyone at the hotel was helpful and ever so accommodating. They made us feel very welcome. We received a call from our airline that our return flight was cancelled and we had to cut our trip short. the hotel allowed us to cancel our last night and also to take a quick shower and pack in our rooms even though technically, we had extended past check-out time. that was gracious and very helpful as we now had to dash to the airport to make the flight on which they rebooked us. The location is only a few blocks from the Tsujiki Fish market as well. this world famous market is leaving its location as of November 2016, so you must visit!

Perhaps I've been spoiled with great services I have received so far from other Marriott locations but Courtyard Ginza doesn't seem to fit that picture of hospitality. I've been given a basic double bed and was told that I could change to a bigger room (only from a bed size perspective and not the space). I tried working at the narrow desk in the room and found the space too small to work. The wifi connection is the room was also weak.

Venture further to Yurakucho area (around 15 minutes walk) you can find Tokyu Hands and Muji. Tsukiji is a short ride of metro from Ginza, or even walking. Tried the hotel's gym this time. It is equipped with some weights and couple of hi-tech treadmills. It is not big however it is adequate for a quick workout to start the day. Remember to book for your Airport Limousine with the hotel desk, it can be charged straight to your room to make it easy for your business expense claim.

It is close to shopping but not the kind I was looking for. Ginza is mostly high end jewelry, cosmetics, accessories just like Paris, New York, or London. I was looking for more indigenous Japanese goods: enamel ware, tea sets, wood block prints. I was able to find some of these but, even with the concierge's help, it was difficult and what I wanted I found not too far away by metro. The hotel checked me in at 3:30 PM and my room was small but perfectly adequate. The A/C was good, the amenities OK, the light and noise factors were very good, and the in room internet (free for Marriott Rewards members) was excellent-in fact better than access in the lobby. There's a Keurig machine with lots of pods, tea, a refrigerator/minibar, and 6 pillows on the bed(!) The concierge spoke perfect English with an LA twang, and he helped a great deal when I tried to decipher the ingredients of a cold remedy I bought at the local pharmacy. Strangely enough, the cold remedy containing hydrocodeine and ephedrine is OTC, but the innocuous albuterol inhaler that I wanted requires a prescription (like the US). I had wanted to stay as late as possible since my flight was a midnight but 3 PM was the limit. 5 PM would have cost me 1500 Yen and any time after 5, a staggering whole night's rent. The lobby is comfortable and there are 5-6 times a day buses to Narita and Haneda direct from the hotel for 1400 Yen and 950 Yen, respectively. The hotel has a great idea in utilizing a map with commercial landmarks. I got lost anyway since I couldn't find many of the stores on the map. Japan is a very easy place to get lost. I wouldn't stay in Ginza again as other areas are more interesting to me. BTW, beware of Marriott's ""Best Rate Guarantee."" I found room on Apoda.com for half the cheapest rate on Marriott's website and another for about 2/3 Marriott's rate on Expedia.com. Marriott declined to honor their guarantee in both cases citing I had used a ""voucher-type"" system in a ""non-US hotel"" for my first claim and that I had ""used more than one hotel in my comparison"" as the basis for denying my other claim. I really didn't understand either reason for denial. When I wrote to customer service, I received the consummate corporate gobbledygook that essential said they had reasons and should any of them apply, then tough luck.It seems that if Marriott has a ""best rate guarantee,"" that should mean that the best rate possible is obtained on their website. Maybe they call it the ""best rate sometimes guarantee."" The hotel, apparently, didn't hold my claims against me, and in fact, the free buffet breakfast was exceptional.","Petaluma, California","james p</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Petaluma, California</strong>",197,4.0

At Higashi Ginza station take exit A1 and walk about 150m to reach the hotel.The hotel is also serviced by airport limousine buses, which is convenient if you have lots of luggage.

We just came from staying at a Ryokan in Kyoto which was great but we needed a little more modern accommodations and this hit the spot!We took the JR train from Kyoto to Tokyo. Got off one stop short at Shinjuku but about the same distance to the hotel as the last Tokyo stop. Taxi to hotel about $20. Note about cab drivers in Japan: they do not speak English & they are not familiar with the city. Hand them an address (or street sign photo) in Japanese if you want a better chance of finding a location.Stayed 2 nights before catching a cruise around Hokkaido. Hotel is modern, clean & centrally located. Amenities & toiletries are numerous. Loved the Yukata, slippers, shavers, toothbrushes, shampoos, conditioner & bath soaps. We received a free upgrade so our room had a tub with a jacuzzi too. Of course I have to mention the Toto toilets that are famous in Japan. It's a combination bidet, washer & bottom refresher. Once you use them you never want to go back to your old toilets at home! Pay for the breakfast buffet…it's worth the money & saves you from hunting for a restaurant in the rain or rush hour.

We checked back with the front desk in a couple od days and even though the guy who had checked us at mid-night was not at the desk - he had left our info with the front desk to ensure our upgrade request was honored - not having to tell our request-story again and having someone ready with a key was priceless!Another instance was the free vouchers for drinks we got since their concierge was closed.

The stand-out event happened my last day. I had a very late departure from Tokyo that evening and was allowed to have a late check out, but this still left me with several hours and much work to do before leaving for the airport. I was able to do much of this in the lobby without issue but I needed a quiet place with Wi-Fi for a group Skype. The business center is in the basement level but I found it did not have Wi-Fi access. I asked staff for any ideas and they immediately whisked me up to the main restaurant where there is a single private room I did not even know about. This in itself was of terrific help and would have sufficed but with a smile and an ‘I have a better idea’, staff then escorted me to an empty conference room upstairs, spent several minutes turning on the WI-FI router and I was told I could use it as long as I needed. No questions asked, no groans at my need, no charge. WOW. All of it done without hesitation, and full of smiles and friendly discussion. There are a few more business-priced hotels in Tokyo than a few years ago and some of them are also members of the Marriott Group and some even tend to be listed at a bit lower cost than the Courtyard Marriott Ginza.

Even though it's a Courtyard, we were very impressed at the overall facilities and hospitality we encountered. We took the Airport Limousine Bus (w/toilet) from Narita Airport and it was an hour and a half ride directly to the hotel dropping us off at the front door. So very convenient than taking a taxi or dragging luggage around on the bus or train. The cost per person was 3100 yen or $26. The hotel is about a 2 block walk (5 minutes) from the Ginza shopping district where you can find anything and everything. The hotel provided umbrellas for those rainy days. The room we booked was small (less than 275-300 sq ft, but expected in Japan) and was impeccably clean especially the bathroom, carpet and bedding area. I always look for cleanliness in a hotel, and for a Marriott Courtyard, I was surprised as I have stayed in 5 star hotels but have been disappointed. I believe Japan facilities in general are super clean compared to other countries especially in Asia. The breakfast buffet was plentiful, but the offerings were the same on a daily basis; no change in the menu and the usual suspects were available, bacon, eggs, bread, cereal, japanese fare, etc. The buffet was included in the room we booked. We were also given a complimentary welcome drink coupon and availed of that in the lobby bar. There was an issue with our room which was handled professionally and swiftly by the front desk. Newspaper delivery in English was at our front door daily. The basic bathroom toiletries were provided as well as dryer, ironing board and iron and in room safe. The closet also had a linen and clothing air freshener spray whose fragrance was absolutely wonderful smelling (should have inquired about purchasing that as it was better than an Febreeze or Downey fabric refresheners out there!). Wifi was free for Marriott Rewards members in room and free for all in the lobby area. As mentioned, the location of the hotel is centrally located and nothing is more than a 10-20 minute walk as far as shopping, supermarket, fast but good Japanese food and 4-5 star restaurants. The train station is also nearby, one dropping off right underneath the shopping center. Signs are in English so no problem traveling around by train to venture outside of the city. Since this is the only Marriott property in the Ginza area, we would definitely stay here again and looking forward to doing so.","Los Angeles, California","Maria R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",47,4.0

It is NOT your average Courtyard! In fact I would say that it's as good as and possibly better than some Marriott properties. Updated interiors with Japanese accents, excellent service (as you might expect in Japan). Room sizes are closer to American norms than the usual tiny rooms in Japan (or Europe, for that matter). There are few and only minor clues that this is a Courtyard: the bathroom amenities (which are generous) are of a lower quality, and there is no executive lounge. There is a great breakfast buffet (free for gold/platinum members) with a wide variety of choices and a nice vibe. Gold/platinum members also get a free drink in the small lounge area. The location is near a number of different subway lines (less than 5 minute walk to each) and also less than 5 minute walk to the main part of Ginza. So convenient! Hotel faces a slightly big street but it's pretty quiet overall, which is really nice. As with most/all of Japan, neighborhood is totally safe. There's a Tully's, Denny's and convenience store within a few blocks. The ""Airport Limousine"" airport bus stops at the hotel -- soooo convenient, especially if you have luggage of any size -- why lug it through train stations and up stairs when you can get on a bus with your luggage and be dropped off at the front door of the hotel? Rooms are very quiet, have blackout curtains, and a bilingual tv with a handful of English language stations. (Be sure to press the ""bilingual"" button on the English language remote to switch the broadcast language) There's a fitness center in the basement but I've never used it or seen it.

Bathrooms are small as usual, but not to the point of being uncomfortable. Rooms facing toward the front entrance of the hotel have a nicer view of the boulevard and if high enough, might even see the Tsukiji fish market. If you are a Marriott platinum member or if your room is in the concierge/club level, you get access to a free breakfast buffet which is superb in quality and assortment. A great value even if having to pay for breakfast. What makes this place great is it's central location.

I am very grateful I did.From Check-in to Check-out, the service was amazing. Japanese hospitality is always fantastic, but the staff at the Courtyard Marriott Tokyo Ginza took it to a whole new level. I had asked for some parcels to be delivered ahead of check-in, and it was waiting for me in the room. Check-in was swift, particularly after an overnight flight, and the room is very large, even for Tokyo standards. Large King size bed, working table, and small lounge still allowed for plenty of room. The bathroom was modest, yet a little dated. I believe the key selling point for the hotel is its restaurant - I believe it is one of the best breakfast buffets in Tokyo. A fine mixture of Western and Japanese is offered for breakfast, and service was attentive and willing to go the extra mile (even when asked to switch the TV to the tennis!) I also had lunch at the restaurant, and the buffet was again extremely good. The location in Higashi Ginza is close to all the sights of Ginza, and is a 10 minute easy walk to Yurakucho. It is a good location to base yourself if you have not been to Tokyo previously. My room rate included free internet, but I understand not all room rates include this.

Very clean hotel.The hotel is far from Narita airport, but that's through no fault of the hotel. It really is just that Narita airport is far away. We had an airport shuttle that picked us up and dropped us off right at the hotel lobby. The hotel staff organized the airport shuttle for us with no issues. We asked in the morning before we left for a day of exploring. All they wanted to know was when our flight left.

The room was very similar to hotel rooms in North America in terms of space and amenities. Definitely not the ""small room size"" that I had read about in most hotels in Japan. We received free wifi at the hotel and the signal was great (it met our needs for checking email, using Google maps, writing Tripadvisor reviews, playing online games on our apple products, etc.). Our bags didn't arrive until the next day, but the hotel room provided everything we needed (including toothbrushes and toothpaste, combs, razors, shaving cream, after shave, etc.)... which was awesome! I also loved the fact that the hotel (like all hotels in Japan) was very Eco friendly. There was also a free safe in the room, which came in handy to lock up our valuables before leaving the room (and not having to carry it around with us).The location of the hotel was great as well. There were tons of restaurants and shops all around us. The subway station was 1.5 blocks away from the hotel, making travel around Tokyo a breeze (getting used to buying the tickets and figuring out which subway lines takes a little getting used to, but the local people were very helpful and even offered to help us without us having to ask). The hotel provided printed out maps of the hotel's location and surrounding areas, which came in handy at other subway stations when we were tying to buy tickets (we just pointed to the hotel location on the map and the train personnel directed us to the right trains - when going back to the hotel).There was also a Lawson minimart on the same block just a short walk (less than a min) from the hotel. It has all your essentials, including prepackaged meals which were very affordable (made for a quick breakfast). It is open 24/7, which was very useful when we woke up form our jet lag around 1:30 am (not having eaten dinner) and needed to grab some food quickly.There is a Japanese theater 2 blocks away from the hotel. We saw it on from the bus on our half-day tour of Tokyo and went back to see if we could catch a show after the tour was over.

This is definitely a much higher end hotel than we would have chosen if we had booked by ourselves and I am actually surprised it was included in our package. We paid about $2,100 US for the package (for both of us) which included: 2 nights at the Courtyard Marriott in Ginza and 3 nights at the New Miyako Hotel in Kyoto, free wifi in all hotel rooms, airport-hotel transfers in a private car (to the hotel from the Narita airport and back to the airport from Kyoto), 1 half day tour in Tokyo, a full day tour of Mt. Fuji and surrounding areas (including reserved seats on the shinkansen train ride to Kyoto with JTB travel representatives meeting us at each train station to ensure we transferred to the right trains and even walking with us from the Kyoto train station to the New Miyako Hotel), a full day tour of Kyoto & Nara, all entrance fees included and an English speaking tour guide. Initially I thought this seemed a little expensive (I am a thrifty traveler), however after staying at both hotels and receiving excellent service throughout the entire trip, this was actually a bargain... I feel like I should have paid a lot more for the experience I had... simply amazing! I would personally recommend anyone planning to come to Japan for the first time (which was the case for my wife and myself), to definitely book this type of package (you will be taken care of well and it takes the stress out of being in a new country and culture). I would also recommend Jessica as an excellent travel agent who can help to plan out your trip to your customized specifications and she ensures that you always get more value for your money (which I love!!).","Toronto, Canada","HumblTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",69,5.0

Here is my perspective. I'm Premier Elite Marriott awards member, based in North America, but I have traveled extensively in Asia. I have stayed at some of the really great hotels in the Marriott chain, and this is not one of those. What the Courtyard Tokyo Ginza Hotel is though, is a safe, clean, good hotel, in a great location, with an excellent staffThe advantages of staying at this hotel, starts at the Narita airport, where for around $30 dollars a person, you can get a limo bus ticket inside the airport, whose last stop is the hotel entrance. Depending on traffic the ride will take an hour. A return ticket can also be purchased at the hotel. A taxi will cost around $300. Upon arrival at the hotel, you will be met by a friendly, helpful desk crew, who in my experience all spoke English quite well. The rooms are small, but this is typical of most hotels in Asia. The rooms though are kept very clean, and the bathrobe kimonos, morning paper, and waking to birds singing through the hall's audio system are nice touches.The hotel has several bars and restaurants, but I only took advantage of the breakfast buffet, which was given to me, because of the absence of of a executive room at the hotel. The buffet is above average with a wide selection, and includes both local, European, and American, breakfast options and an omelet bar. My only small complaint is that for the week I stayed there, the selections were exactly the same.The big plus of this hotel is it is right in the Ginza district. The are massive amounts of great high end entertainment, dining and shopping options within a short walking distance. A must visit is the Tsukiji Fish Market which is an easy 5-7 minute walk away. Go early since many of the top sushi places close before noon. Can you say sushi breakfast. Also watch out for traffic, zooming around the small roads at the market, since its main focus is not tourism, and many workers are just trying to get the job done.When it comes time to spread your wings and explore other areas of Tokyo, I found with a little experimentation, that the Tokyo subway system was quite easy, if a little crowded. Just around the corner of the hotel are the Ginza and Higashi Ginza stations that can get you almost anywhere you want to go easily. The break through for me in understanding the subway, was the realization that most of the numbers you see is on the routing maps, are the amount of money you need to put on a ticket to get to that place. Make sure to grab your ticket if you haven't reached your destination. Also the JR line is owned by a separate company and requires a separate ticket.Finally take advantage of this hotel's secret weapon, their concierge Marina Ahmad. She seems to have an answer to all questions. She was able to get me tickets, to the sold out Sumo tournament in September, and arrange for tickets to a show I saw on Anthony Bourdain's travel show. She was also a wealth of knowledge on shopping and dining and getting around Tokyo. Don't put all your eggs in her basket though. Top events in Tokyo sell out early and making reservations prior to your trip is recommended.In conclusion then I definitely would recommend a stay here unless your main priority is high end in hotel luxury service.","Dallas, Texas","Craig H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",4,4.0

We had connecting rooms with extra bed in one of the rooms. The rooms are a bit small but this is normal in Tokyo. The bathroom does not look very new but everything was in perfect state and very clean. Limited international TV channels. The beds are really, really comfortable, and the rooms are quiet at night. All of us slept very well every single night, and awoke fully rested every morning. I'll say it again: great sleep.Staff were super nice, as seems to be the happy normal in Japan! We didn't have any problems they had to solve but every single staff we addressed was always courteous and helpful. Check-in and check-out were a breeze.Breakfast was good: egg station, pancake/waffle station, hotplates with several cooked dishes, cereal, bread & toast, cheese, pastry, fruit, yogurt, Japanese breakfast items (tried the miso soup, was good). Juices from a drinks fountain, didn't try them. Tea, brewed coffee and machine for espresso coffee.We had the buffet dinner one night and, with the 30% discount voucher provided plus the half-price reduction for kids, it was a very affordable dinner, cheaper than most outside places around the hotel. Not a very large selection but surely enough for us; we liked the foie rice bowl & salmon sushi bowl most. Desserts were also good, our boys enjoyed the chocolate fountain.Location is really great, smack in the middle of Ginza, a 5-minute nice walk to Higashi Ginza station, 10 min to Tsukijishijo station and 12 to Shinbashi (a big station with several lines including the circular Yamanote line), which is the one we used most often.The attention I received as a Platinum member was very good: free breakfasts for all of us and, since the hotel does not have an executive lounge, a free drink for all of us each day at the lobby lounge. The breakfast deal was the best thing for our family.Wifi was spotless during the whole stay, both in the rooms and public areas.There are plenty of breakfast/lunch/dinner options around, the concierge will give you a Ginza map with the restaurants marked. I recommend Tenkuni, great tempura! Also, do go for sushi breakfast to Tsukiji market (a 15-minute walk from the hotel). Sounds a bit weird for breakfast but it is the freshest sushi you'll ever have, at reasonable prices, and we heard the market will move maybe next year so grab the opportunity while it is there.","Shanghai, China","JMC_and_Family</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",55,5.0

Close to the hotel are many restaurants, both up class ones fit for business entertainments but also ones for family and solo business visitors. The UNIQLO store on the main road is huge and was having a super sale drive going on.Coming back to the hotel itself, we found the buffet breakfast very good, especially for the health conscious. We should have tried its dinner buffet as well, but we were attracted to other restaurants outside. We did have dinner at the Japanese restaurant on its basement, nothing spectacular, though.Its lobby lounge cum cafe is quiet, fit for a refreshing drink after venturing outside. It appeared to be popular amongst locals during the afternoon, too, and offered high tea set.The hotel is also served by the airport shuttle service from/to Narita, Passengers should buy the return tickets at the airport upon arrival, and will be rewarded with a very good discount.

The word Ginza is easily associated with Japan and one start thinking of Japanese women dressed in Kimono. In reality Ginza is just like any other city in the world. It is here that Courtyard by Marriot Tokyo Ginza Hotel is located and part of Marriot hotel chains around the world.Having been to one of the most astounding hotel in Tokyo previously, it is not easy to make comparison with Courtyard by Marriot Tokyo Ginza as this hotel has its own uniqueness. The best part of this hotel is when you arrived they will bring your luggage in and deliver them to your room with you. The check in process is superb and efficient and touch of class as they would allow you to check in to your room slightly earlier than the given time which makes you feel welcomed. The staff are well trained and they know exactly what the guests wanted and assist them by just looking at our situation. The best part while staying in this hotel is that you feel wonderful and appreciated.I would say their basement restaurant offered the best price for simple Tempura in the whole of Japan with Yen 1,000 one can have tempura for lunch or dinner with a cozy ambiance of a hotel [price may change over time]. Breakfast is reasonably well stocked with American/European selection plus some Japanese dishes. There were no rushing at the time we stayed and we managed to spent our time tasting all the delicacies.The room are up to Marriot standard and they have a Room with No: 911 which we stayed but was peaceful and no explosion. The hotel is just 5 blocks away from the famous main street for shopping for almost all branded items. There are restaurants and cafes all around which you will never feel hungry. It is important that when you are in Japan that we try to sample many of the restaurants and cafes and taste the various food and cakes. Presentation of sweets are chocolates are marvelous and they painstakingly wrap your purchase and it is only happening in Japan.Courtyard by Marriot Tokyo Giza is centrally located and we can easily reach Shinjuku, Shibuya - Haraju/Takeshita, Omotesando, Roppongi Hills, Mid Town and Asakusa from there, although Ikebukuro is slightly further away. You may choose to be located in Ginza, or Shinjuku, Shibuya or Ikebukuro and you will always be right as each one has its own characteristics and you can always travel to the others. Public transportation is super efficient but taxi is also affordable if you travel in group of 3 or 4 and avoid the rush hour in the morning and in the evening. On saturday and sunday the streets are less congested. The hotel is also well connected with the Airport limousine which makes it more easier to come from Narita airport and vice versa.All in all, we had a wonderful stay at Courtyard by Marriot Tokyo Ginza and the opportunity to stay in different hotels gives a better understanding of the world of hospitality as each hotel has its own strength, attractiveness and uniqueness.

I have stayed in Courtyard properties in Asia and they are to a high standard. This isn't any different. As a platinum member we also got breakfast coupons and drink coupons for each day of stay. Always a nice perk and grateful when they occur. Within about 2 minutes walk from Higashi-Ginza station and 4-5 minutes from Ginza station. Both exits have maps outside the station @ street level which indicate where the Courtyard is -- easy to find if arriving via subway. More than plenty of food choices in a 4-5 minute walking radius. Japanese, Indian, Turkish, Portuguese, Italian, etc. Plenty of coffee shops as well as 7/11, Lawsons and Family Mart convenience stores also very close. Pro's: ++ Marina the concierge has been great. Very informative and pleasant. ++ Breakfast foods in wide variety and good quality-- even has an omelet station++ excellent WiFi (free for platinum guests) . Came with 2 laptops, 2 iPhones and 2 iPads and never had problems even with all of them running on the same room-based Wifi. Lots of charging ports in the room also. ++ room fitted well and overall property in very good condition. ++ had a non-smoking section of the restaurant/lobby so it was nice to have a location to have a drink or afternoon tea. Things to be aware of (certainly not not cons)  - As stated in several other posts -- Small rooms. We have two overhead-bin sized rollaboards and there's little room to store them and still get around the room. We have a 2-double bedded room.  - I'm 6'1 and while standing in the shower, my head just almost hits the vent. Still plenty of room, but if I were taller would need to stoop.  - Noticed they hadn't refilled the room tea/coffee supplies and had to ask. ^^^ for all the above Would certainly recommend for those OK with spending 200-225USD per night and wanting a great location with the brand-recognition of a Marriott property","San Francisco, California","schrap2755</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",70,4.0

We enjoyed our stay and had mostly positive experiences. Previously we have used several Courtyard properties throughout Europe, but this was the first in Asia. I am glad to say that the ""Marriott attention to guest satisfaction"" is applied at the Ginza Courtyard. The service was usually excellent.- Location is a real plus for this hotel; Ginza being an exciting part of Tokyo. There is a metro stop within a five minute walk from the hotel. Tokyo Station is a short taxi or subway ride away. The hotel is one of the stops for direct coach service between Tokyo and the two Tokyo airports (Narita and Haneda). While it might take a bit longer on the coach rather than by taxi and train, getting to the airport without having to handle any luggage until actually at the airport has appeal.- We were not expecting a gigantic room, after all this is Tokyo. But we were a bit surprised at the size of the standard room. The bathroom especially is very small. They have a fairly decent fitness center. A respectable WiFi service is available though-out the hotel. It is free for Marriott Reward members or about 12USD otherwise. The central heating in the hotel was turned off so they provided a small portable heater that eventually warmed up the room in the evenings.- Guest Services has a very extensive collection of material prepared on Tokyo and the surrounding area tourist sites. Not only does it say which metro/subway station to get off at, it also says which station exist to use. Overall this service was outstanding. The staff there would go out of their way to provide information if it wasn't already prepared.- Breakfast at the hotel was limited to the buffet. It does include an extremely large variety selection, all well prepared and presented. However, for those of us who normally eat a lighter breakfast, 25 USD for a Continental style breakfast gets a bit pricey. We asked about a la carte but were told it wasn't available. Fortunately there are numerous eating opportunities right outside the hotel doors, including an excellent Indian restaurant directly behind the hotel and an excellent cafe directly across the street.","Odenton, Maryland","bd2016db</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Odenton, Maryland</strong>",75,4.0

While I love the Ritz Carlton in Roppongi, my clients don’t always love their prices!! The Prince Sakura Tower and the Tokyo Marriott in Shinagawa are also options, but not as convenient or centrally located for my purposes. On this trip, I debated between staying at the Courtyard Marriott Ginza Hotel and the brand new Courtyard Marriott Tokyo Station. Ultimately, because I would have been checking into the Tokyo Station hotel on its opening day and I was concerned about delays, I decided to stay at the Ginza location – and it was a good choice.Here is what I liked about the hotel:• The front desk, as well as people throughout the hotel, spoke very good English, were friendly and helpful, and there were always several people working – so there was never a significant wait.• The breakfast buffet was included for Marriott Platinum members and it was quite good. It offered both Japanese and western food options.• The fitness room was small, but the equipment was clean and in good working order. There were several treadmills, as well as other machines and free weights.• My room was spacious with a modern bathroom. It also had a safe that was big enough for a laptop.• Wifi was fast and I never had to reconnect during my 5 day stay – I think this is one of the first hotels I have stayed in where that has been the case and I travel every week.• The location was excellent – it’s within walking distance to subway lines, as well as to the Ginza. Plus, the airport limousine bus stops at the hotel.There was one area where I thought the hotel could improve:• The concierge - while I have read in previous reviews that she is quite good, during my stay it seemed as though she was never there. On two separate days, I was told that she was “off” and there was no replacement. On both days, I could have used her help – and, while the front desk did help, they didn’t have all of the information that I would have liked. I do think concierge service should be provided on a daily basis and I found it frustrating that she wasn’t working for so much of my stay.Overall, this is a good choice if you are looking for a Marriott property. I’d love Marriott to consider a JW/full-service property around Roppongi, Shinjuku, or Ginza – there are some wonderful Marriott properties in Asia and I’d love to see one in Tokyo.","Chicago, Illinois","SeeingTheWordFromORD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",204,4.0

And they were fully booked for the following night. It's easy to say 'be pragmatic, mistakes happen' - but when you're left with no room for tomorrow it's not much fun. And it shouldn't happen: in hundreds of nights in hotels over the years, this is the first time it's happened and I've been met with a blank look from the (slow, vague) check-in staff. Not great.But regardless of that, because that could be a one-off, how was the rest of the experience? OK, but no more. The room was new-ish, but tiny and extremely expensive.

We stayed for about five days, then went to Kyoto and Hiroshima, and then came back to Tokyo and were re-welcomed like long-lost friends! The breakfast buffet was excellent with great variety of Asian and non-Asian foods, and the service there and also at the lobby bar was also very good. The hotel is a very short walk to the metro, which is very easy to use. Get a Pasmo card! There are also many great restaurants within a short walk. There is very high-end shopping on the main street, but check out GU! It's amazingly inexpensive with very stylish clothes. Also, being a platinum elite member gets you free breakfast and free wifi.The only down side to visiting Tokyo is that there is no partner bank for Bank of America, so make sure to get your yen at home and bring enough, so you won't need an ATM, since the fees are quite high. This, obviously, is not the fault of the hotel--it's something our bank needs to work out..but just be aware and check to see if YOUR bank has branches here.One huge amazing note: we happened to mention that we were going to a restaurant for my husband's birthday, and about five minutes later,there was a knock on the door and he was presented with a beautiful fruit tart with a happy birthday message--so thoughtful!!

We enjoyed the buffet breakfast.One note about traveling as a family in Japan: hotel rooms with two queen sized beds are very, very rare. Rooms tend to be either a queen or two fulls. Given the ages and temperaments of our kids, we were able to rent a queen room for my husband and I and the kids were in the room next door on two full beds. Our friends' kids are not quite so independent so they had two adjoining rooms, each with full beds. Rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable.The hotel concierge helped us with dinner reservations and the hotel had a variety of preprinted sheets with info on various neighborhoods/sights which was very helpful.","San Jose, California","travelfan26</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",12,4.0

With its Ginza location you are a short walk from the subway, the famous Tokyo Fish Market, the famous shopping strips and a multitude of excellent restaurant choices. Further, throughout my week in Tokyo, as I ventured to the other main areas of the city, I repeatedly reaffirmed my choice and would happily stay at the Courtyard again. Getting there was a cinch, as the Airport Limo from Narita Airport stops right in front of the hotel and runs essentially on the hour. As for the hotel facilities itself, the rooms are big for Tokyo, the service was excellent and the Staff is bi-lingual, which is a relief after spending a day struggling to use the same 10 Japanese words to accomplish life in Tokyo. My one complaint (and a common one here), is their internet connectivity. It is poor at best and for the life of me I cannot imagine why they don't get it fixed, as there were many who were frustrated by it.The on-site restaurants were excellent as well, with fairly good prices by Tokyo hotel standards.All in all, the Courtyard is a great choice for any visitor, but particularly useful to the first timer.

Location was superb, accessible via 3 stations: Higashi-ginza (closest), Ginza and Shimbashi. This pretty much covers all the lines we needed to use regardless of where we were going. It was a relatively quiet and clean area but you'll be surprised to find all the shopping just the next street away! So many restaurants as well in the area. Lawsons is just around the corner too if you need something urgently. The hotel immediately took our luggage and handled it for us all the way up to the room. We only had to take care of ourselves. Check in was easy, smooth and it was nice to come into comfortable and cooling room. The room was nicely decorated and sheets wonderful to sleep in. They also had a yukata in the wardrobe for you to use, nice touch of Japanese culture. The room even has a power socket that has an in-build international converter so any sort of plugs can be used through there. Staff were extremely service orientated. Wifi in-room available with signing up of Marriott card foc, lobby has wifi. Reliable and quick internet, no complaints. They had suggested activities for guests, front desk was helpful with advice on attractions and English was not a problem. I also booked this hotel because the limousine buses to the airport stops here. The hotel saved us so much hassle since we were all going to different airports and terminals. We just needed to tell them the time, turn up and follow their instructions. If you can, get the pass that includes the TM one day ticket for 100 yen more as well, very worth it. Each ride on the metro usually costs at least 160 yen one way. A very convenient option especially if you don't want to spend time finding out where to book, how to book etc. although we did that. All in all, nearby everything and even if public transport is necessary, it is only a 5 minute walk away. It was so easy to get around anywhere around Tokyo staying here and our stay was pleasant and hassle free.

I travel to Japan on business about once per quarter. The company I visit normally puts me up in a business hotel near their offices in the Aoyama District. On my most recent trip to Japan, I was only stopping for one night before traveling the next day on a domestic flight out of Haneda. This gave me the perfect opportunity to stay at this hotel, and I am glad that I did.I should mention that I am at an elite level with Marriott, which gives me a few amenities free of charge that others would have to pay to receive. I was given a normal sized room, which was huge by Japanese standards. I was also given breakfast free of charge. The breakfast was a nice buffet with eggs to order, fresh fruit, oatmeal, pastries, etc. The hotel is a very short walk from the Higashi-Ginza subway station. I traveled to the hotel from Haneda and returned the following day via this station. An amateur traveler can navigate the Tokyo subway fairly easily, and the hotel is conveniently located nearby. The area also has many stores and restaurants. I would also be remiss if I did not mention the friendliness of the staff. I arrived late into the hotel, and the hotel staff greeted me by name even before I showed them my passport. They were awaiting my arrival. Tokyo tends to be a very expensive city for business travelers. One might expect to pay a lot for this hotel, but I have paid far more and gotten far less.

As you walk out the secured area into the public area of the Narita airport we were facing the desk for the bus that would take us directly to the Marriott Courtyard Ginza. They call it the Airport Limousine or Friendly Airport Limousine. The ticket purchase was quick and easy (35 Yen per person, cash or credit) and the bus left in maybe 20 minutes. They stow your luggage for you under the air conditioned bus and drop you off right at the hotel's front door. There is a desk right inside the hotel to make reservations for when you need to return to the airport. We were upgraded to a Premium room (11th floor) which had lots of room , two bathrooms, a massage chair, a sauna, and heated toilet seats. TV reception was excellent with, I believe, four English channels including CNN, Bloomberg, and a FOX movie channel. There were bird sounds chirping in the hall in the morning and an English newspaper at our door every day. I found the wireless internet connection to be excellent, both on a laptop and an Ipod. I used it every day and never had any problems. It's hard to beat Japanese service. Every member of the Courtyard Ginza front desk staff was extremely helpful, making calls for us for tour and restaurant reservations, breaking our Yen to smaller denominations for subway trips, answering all questions in English. Most, if not all of the front desk staff appeared to read English as well. We mentioned a couple of festivals when we arrived and the next day we were surprised by a personal letter under our door from the concierge explaining each festival and giving us directions on how to get there. They have a rack with papers in the lobby on popular Tokyo sites, how to get there, even how much each leg of the subway or train trip costs. The paper rack is right next to the concierge desk to the left of the elevators. It's an easy walk from the hotel to the fish market, Kabuki theatre, train/subway stops. One train change gets you to the Disney parks. We ate the discounted hotel breakfast twice (15 Yen for Marriott members) and thought it was excellent, mostly American but also some Japanese items...nice mix. There is a Denny's directly across the street (you have to walk a half block down, cross the street then back to get to it). We ate there once but didn't like it and didn't go back. Not your typical American Denny's. There's lots of Japanese places to eat. I suggest very early in your stay you go out the Marriott's front door, turn left and just start walking. Many restaurants have plastic food plates in the window showing you the dishes. That seems to be a big thing in Tokyo. It's not too appetizing to us but It helped. We would just point to a dish we wanted. Many windows also have pictures of the dishes as do some menus. We tried McDonalds, once, maybe six or so blocks away. Disappointing. We hoped for some Japanese type items but it was just like in the U.S. although the fish sandwich did have shrimp in it. Don't miss the Food Court at the Mitkusoshi department store (floor B2), maybe a 4-5 block walk. You will be amazed. We arrived as it opened (10AM) and were the first one in. They have lots of people behind the counter and each one gave a deep bow as we passed (since they weren't yet busy waiting on customers). There is counter after counter of all kinds of prepared foods and pastries.Try their Bento boxes. The Japanese people were courteous, friendly and very helpful. Many times we were looking at a map, either on the street on a subway train and someone would come up to us and ask if they could help. Most spoke a little English but some volunteered to help with no English at all. The Marriott Courtyard Ginza....we had a great experience there from start to finish with excellent service and would highly recommend the hotel.","Brighton, Colorado","diamondjag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brighton, Colorado</strong>",9,5.0

The size of the rooms is large by any standard and MUCH larger than anything else I’ve seen in Tokyo. The bathroom portion of my last room at the Courtyard was literally bigger than other full hotel rooms for the price in Tokyo. The 10th and 11th floors have the largest rooms and many of these are large enough for families and certainly large enough to conduct business in. Most of these are split into sleeping portions and a large living portion. They are not all laid out the same, and some have large meeting-room-style desks sectioned off from the sleeping area so you don’t need to book a meeting room as you would with other hotels.The location is equidistant from the various business areas and not far from most tourist destinations. A great deal of shopping as well as parks well-worth long walks are within a short stroll. A multitude of local and international style restaurants are also nearby.

The hotel is also within walking distance of the Imperial Palace and its gardens. The rooms are small but very nice and quiet. The bath was very tiny.

The food in the main restaurant is delicious but high priced like most things in the area. Breakfast was about $25 per person. For lower food prices try Denny's across the street from the Courtyard. There is also a second restaurant in the basement and a bar in the lobby which offers drinks and snacks. There is no pool nor spa at this hotel. WIFI was free and the staff offered good service.

I have stayed at this Courtyard five or six times and found it to be more than adequate each time. The location is superb right in the heart of Ginza. It is within walking distance of the Higashi-Ginza and Nihombashi Metro stations. There is also an airport bus that makes a stop at the hotel which is a very useful amenity. Each time I have stayed, my check-in and check-out experiences have always been very efficient and the staff were always friendly and helpful. The rooms are adequate as they are a bit larger than most Japanese hotels but not nearly as large as those in the US Courtyards. Nonetheless, I have always found them clean and reasonably comfortable. I think the biggest drawback to the facility is that it only has two elevators. That makes for some logjams in the morning on occasion. The breakfast buffet is very good and I was particularly happy with the choices on my recent visit. If you want to save a little money, however, there is a Denny's across the street (and I have taken that option before). For what you get, the price is not bad though it rides the edge of my budget just a bit. But the room rate is actually quite fair considering the location and the prices offered by other similar hotels in the area.

Lots of great places to eat and tons of shopping. The staff is very helpful and most speak english. The rooms are fairly standard for Japan - a little small, but clean and who spends a lot of time in a room anyway? Others posted that they had problems with the internet - according to my son, the wireless needs to be reset since it can only handle 200-300 IP addresses and once all of the address occupy the server, no one else can log in. We encountered a problem with the public WI-FI in the lobby on our fisrt night and once we told the front desk to reset (unplug and plug the wireless router), we were able to get online every time without any problems. The in-room WI-FI worked great and free if you have attained ""gold or platinum"" Marriott reward status. My 22 year old son did all of his shopping at the DonK (short for Don Quixote), three blocks towards the Shimbashi JR station. What a great store - everythinkg from inexpensive gifts to high end electronics, watches and liquor. I would highly recommend purchasing a Japan Rail pass before arriving in Japan - the JR station (Shimbashi) is about 7 blocks (less than 10 minute walk) from the hotel. Very walkable and convenient to take the Yamonte line to either Shinagawa or Tokyo station to catch the Shinkasen. We paid $375 for ""green car"" (first class) unlimited use, 7 day pass. After adding up day trips to Nagano, Sendai, Niigata, Kyoto and Hiroshima, it would have cost over $1500 each, so we saved over $1,100. The subway is within a block (Ginza line) but the JR pass does not cover the subways.

The hotel is situated just off the main drag in Ginza. It is great for seeing Ginza and taking in the sights of this busy district. It is conveniently located for that purpose. The rooms were clean and ok sized. I do have one complaint about the head clearance in the bathrooms, when standing in the shower the overhead clearance is maybe 6'3"". Rather short for a taller person. They did have amenities such as soaps and lotions. But the bathroom was rather cramped. The room itself had a decent sized bed with a TV and a minibar. Wifi & LAN cost extra so we didn't use it.There are a few subway and train lines that run nearby but if you are using a JR rail pass (like we did) then you'll have a hefty walk to the nearest JR station (maybe 15-20 minutes at a normal speed). There are other options for transportation such as the subway system, but for JR rail pass holders you'd have to shell out about 200-300 yen per way.There are numerous food options around the hotel, but if you are looking for the mom & pop type of ramen or small eatery, they are few and far between in Ginza. The area of Ginza is more high scale with fine dining options and fine entertainment. If you are looking for a more low key approach then I wouldn't recommend staying in Ginza.Overall it was a good hotel, but for the cost I would rather stay in one of the other prefectures of Tokyo and travel to see Ginza rather than stay in Ginza.","Oahu, Hawaii","islandboylp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oahu, Hawaii</strong>",9,4.0

The bathroom was quite cramped but it was just me, was spotlessly clean, and had nice amenities and plenty of hot water. The fridge, safe, and wifi all worked great. Folks at the front desk were friendly and jumped to help. Can't comment on value as it was a company direct pay. I did not use any food services in the hotel but I never do.

We noticed this shortly after checking in and went to the bell desk to see what we should do. Mr. Suzuki immediately began trying to help us. I had paid the taxi in cash and did not get a receipt so we had no idea which taxi company we had used. Mr. Suzuki started calling taxi companies and reporting our loss. A couple of hours later, much to our surprise, Suzuki San called our room. The taxi drive, a Yamada San had brought my wife’s purse back to the hotel! Of course, everything was in order. This is an example of wonderful service from Mr. Suzuki, one of the hotel associates, but Japan in general.Our room was 814. By U.S. standards, it was small, but for the two of us, perfectly adequate and very comfortable. The room was very quiet, something we both appreciated. The bathroom was, like the room, compact, but very nice. The toilet had the feature to wash your private parts at the push of a button. I had never experienced this before, but really grew to like it! There was a combination deep tub and shower. The mirror had an area that must have been heated from behind because it did not frost up from condensation – a cool feature.The room had a large HD TV with about a half-dozen international channels. I used both the wired and wireless internet service and found it to be quite fast and trouble free. Being a Marriott Rewards member it was complimentary.The room had a small refrigerator which was mostly filled with drinks for purchase. There was enough room to put a few things of ours into the refrigerator. The room also had an electronic display that could be set to “clean the room” or “do not disturb.” I liked this feature. Our room was perfectly clean when we checked in and the house keeper kept it perfectly clean during our stay.The Courtyard is very conveniently located! It was less than a 10 minute walk to either Shimbashi station or Ginza subway station. Nishi Ginza was even closer. For my wife and I we really appreciated the Denny’s restaurant right across the street! We had breakfast there daily. A full breakfast for the two of us was about US$ 15.00. Service was really excellent and the food quite good.We also visited a Starbucks that is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel each morning for our Venti Lates. Prices at Starbucks were just about the same as at home in California. They packed our to-go order in a bag with a cup holder so that the drinks would not spill. Excellent service.There are so many restaurants within a short walk from the hotel that we did not have any meals at the hotel. Being in Tokyo for only four nights, we wanted to experience as much of the city as we could.The Courtyard hotel was very convenient and the staff very friendly while giving excellent service. I would definitely return which is about as good of a recommendation as I can give.","Huntington Beach, CA","LakersFan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach, CA</strong>",430,4.0

But it was a step down from the hotel we stayed in in Kyoto. There was no concierge, which in a country where you do not speak the language is a big disappointment. The staff were very nice but the level of their ability in English was low so they could not understand our questions or offer us any help outside the hotel. The room was on the small side but was manageable. It would have been nice to have a second reading chair. The bathroom was small but it had everything we needed. The amenities were of good quality, though they were not always replaced when we ran out (we were there for 5 nights). If you are a member of the Marriott loyalty club there is free wifi in the room, otherwise it costs $13 night, so join the club before leaving. The wifi is a bit slow. The breakfast was good, but depending on the day, sometimes they were out of croissants or fresh fruit.

I was on the fence prior to coming about staying in a place off of airbnb.com, or craigslist, in order to get a different lodging experience while traveling, but ultimately decided on the safe choice with Marriott.The hotel is located in a great location in Tokyo (Ginza), lending itself to great shopping. It is a short walk to the Tsukiji Fish Market, an emerging tourist attraction in Tokyo. Highly recommend verifying the tour registration start times for this attraction, as they can shift depending on the time of the year. Also, ensure to check out 'Sushi Dai' inside the market, and get there around 5am, or you will be in for an at least three hour wait. Prepare yourself for some top quality sushi. Otherwise, the hotel is a short 5-10 minute walk to Ginza Station, which will get you anywhere you need to go in Tokyo, assuming you have some sense to read a subway map and take the correct trains. Also highly recommended in the Lion Sapporo Beer hall (3 min walk) Go nuts on Yebisu, one of the top quality beers in Japan, and thus the world. They make draft variations that are only sold in Japan that you have to try if you are a fan of beer.For the hotel itself, the staff was top notch. The concierge was helpful in lending an umbrella for the days (2 total out of the time I was there) when it rained, lending a phone (appx US$6 a day base charge, but it doesn't allow outgoing SMS... that is bad), and booking a shuttle back to Narita (directly services the hotel - very convenient).The hotel boasts a decent gym with treadmills and some free weights. Great for when you need to get in a workout and detox from the prior night's activities. As a bonus, there are TVs above the treadmills that have international broadcasts. I brought my own jumprope (working on double unders these days), but the low ceiling in there largely prevented me from being able to comfortably do them there.I checked out the breakfast buffet on the last day before checking out and regret that experience. It's in need of some definite work - the espresso machine was needing attention when I came upon it (out of beans), the line for the omelet station was too long (one man making one order at a time - opted not to wait), and the scrambled eggs on the buffet line had a strange consistency. There just didn't seem to be the variety and quality that I'm accustomed to when staying at Marriott properties, understanding that this is a Courtyard and not a JW, but I think they can do better.The room itself was large with good cable tv (both International and Japanese channels), the shower was strong and hot, and the toilets even had bidets, which is a plus. There is a small fridge in the room with cash items (food and drink) that aren't unreasonably priced.Overall, the hotel has a great staff and location, with a high quality room. Just avoid the downstairs restaurant pending some revamping of service and offerings.","Tokyo, Japan","bluejax21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",34,4.0

Because the company I work for has its headquarters in the Ginza, this hotel is most convenient, only a 10 minute walk to our headquarters. The staff is more than courteous, and the hotel is spotlessly clean throughout. Any questions I have had about the hotel or the surrounding areas of the Ginza were answered politely and always with a smile. As a visiting guest, I'm always entertained by my company, and am taken out for all meals during my stays. Therefore, I cannot comment on the food at this Courtyard facility. Before staying at this Courtyard by Marriott, I would stay at the Ginza Dai Ichi. It too, was a fine hotel but the Courtyard is a little more spacious.

On arrival we were upgraded to a room on the Executive top floor and it was a decent size and with the usual amenties you would expect in a Japanese hotel. Location is close to two subway lines and very easy to get around Tokyo. Ginza is high end shopping destination and the large department stores like Mitsukoshi have wonderful food halls where you can buy all types of food. Tshujiki fish market is a 10min walk away and everyone should go here before they close and relocate it next year.

Most of the shopping is high-end, but you can walk a bit further and find options in different price ranges. There's a ramen shop across the street that's cheap and tasty.This hotel does have a govt rate, if that's something for which you qualify. The restaurant Fiore has a lot of good choices for breakfast, and when you check in you can ask for a coupon for a discount on breakfast. At 1500 yen, it's not bad, and you can have a full breakfast buffet with both western and Japanese options. The rooms are pretty standard for Japan - small, but not the smallest I've seen.

It's located in one of the higher end areas of Tokyo, but is fairly priced. First the downsides, as this is a Courtyard there is no lounge for Platinum members but they do provide you with a couple of drink coupons upon check in. There is also no breakfast included, but they provide a coupon for a discount at the onsite restaurant. Now for the positives; the rooms are clean with comfortable beds and wifi in each room. The bathrooms are modern and clean and include toilets with heated seats. There is also a nice tea room restaurant in the lobby area of the hotel that is nice for business meetings. One of the main reasons I stay here is the convenience getting to and from Narita airport. The hotel is located just a few minutes away by taxi from Tokyo central station. There is also a convenient airport bus that costs roughly 35 USD one way that picks up directly in front of the hotel. There are no additional stops and the bus goes direct to Narita taking about an hour.

This is non-smoking hotel, yet I've seen Europeans smoking in the hallway, no one bother them. Yet, I came back from jog and they asked for my hotel key, claiming I might not be a guest (I'm an Asian, by the way) I was talking to other guests from SE Asia, and he told me he was asked the same. Jeez! Marriott discliminates by race now!? They also failed to take a note of my Marriott #, hence I had to come home, weeks later file missing points request.

Chose hotel due to Marriott gold elite perks. Took limousine bus from Haneda airport with no probs, bus stops right outside. Staff very friendly check in was no problem. Room keys have the nifty feature of choosing the elevator floor number automatically, never seen that before. Stayed on 9 th floor, seemed reasonably quiet. There is a definate smell on this floor, could not work out what, even tho smoke free smelt like stale tobacco. Room fine, usual Tokyo size, fixtures and fittings again absolutely fine. Kettle supplied but absolutely min of beverages, ie two sachets ofbgreed tea powder, two fingers of coffee, and that was it. No complimentary water, although water in mini bar which may or may not have been free. Turns out no exec lounge in hotel, but got free internet ok, courtesy of club card. However, voucher for one free happy hour drink (5 to 8pm) and a reduction in breakfast price by 5 pounds to 18 pounds not really good enough to replace free breakfast. Went into dinner buffet, and walked out again, very poor, most of the food not labelled and unimaginative. Moved to japanese restaurant downstairs and again poorly set out english menus so had a much better cheaper meal in Ginza. Given this is a hotel full of english speaking guests the layout of menus, posters and food labelling really is poor. Somebody needs to stop and just look at what a hungry guest sees who doesnt read Japanese. Many western guests are nervous about trying Japanese food, the hotel COULD be a great introduction. Hotel location right in centre of Ginza so very good. Caught coach for Narita with no problems, staff very helpful, it stops right outside the hotel.

But it's well worth it!First, the hotel is located in the heart of Ginza, where real estate is probably the most expensive on Earth. It's like you stay in a hotel on New York's Fifth Avenue, where designer, expensive and elegant boutiques are located. The hotel is actually on Showa dori, one block away from Higashi-Ginza subway station, from where you can easily go anywhere else in Tokyo within one of the most elaborated subway networks in the world.The hotel is clean and modern. Our room is as large as a Courtyard Marriott's room in the US (but this Courtyard Marriott Tokyo Ginza is more on a par with J W Marriott in the US in terms of status and rates, as there is no J W Marriott in Tokyo). There is wired internet in the room for a small fee and wi-fi in the lobby area. Breakfast is not included in the rates, but we do not recommend having breakfast or dinner in the hotel's restaurants, for you can get much better food at much better prices outside, anywhere around. Coffee can only be found in the lobby or in the restaurant, but not in the room. And by the way, Denny's is across the street!What we liked at this hotel is not just the convenience of its location, the excellent service from its staff, but also little things like a counter in the lobby providing sheets with clear and useful guidances for attractions for tourists, or like their toilets! Although the staff is not particularly fluent in English, but you can feel that they go out their way to make you happy and, boy, they are really nice and courteous.

We don't speak Japanese at all although we can read some of the signs so a lot of forward planning ahead but after all these years it is not difficult for me anymore but I want to put this in perspective for anyone who might not read any characters and is in Japan for the first time.Couryard by Marriott is in a really convenient spot it's 2 blocks or 5 minutes behind the main Ginza shopping street with the big department stores and flagship stores. It is 1 block from one subway line and 2 blocks or so from the other subway line or JR line which will link you to all the other popular touristy areas and beyond.It is also within walking distance to the Tsukiji fish market which if you want to go and get a ticket to see the tuna auction at 4am, will prove very useful as you don't have far to go.The hotel is at the end stop for the airport limousine from Narita so you can just hop on and forget about changing trains and carting your luggage around. For someone who does not speak Japanese this is helpful although I've also done it the other way which isn't too hard but needs more concentration.The rooms are big for Japan business hotels, honestly! Their reception staff speaks really really good english - this is invaluable and rather unusual for Japan. They have free wi-fi in the lobby which works well.Forget the breakfast in the hotel unless you have an inclusive package. Forget the Dennys across the road too. Go to these nice Japanese coffee chains that does good coffee and breakfast package. Outside the front door turn left and after a few doors you see Rullys coffee. Continue further and across the road/traffic lights is Pronto. Go out the back door to the lane behind the hotel it's Doutor coffee which is my personal favourite. You might need to point and wave around but ALL Japanese staff are incredibly helpful so you're bound to muddle through.If you fancy noodles or other foods, and if you're on holiday and get up late anyway, go for an early lunch at a restaurant most open by 11am. All the big department stores like Matsuya, Matsuzakaya, GInza, Mitsukoshi all have little restaurants on the top floors you can choose your food by these plastic displays outside first then just point to the staff what you want. Or if you want to buy your own Bento box or snacks, go to the basement floors of the department stores at about the same time and you can eat to your hearts content.In summary, now that i've found this hotel I'll be going back there again for my next trip because it's so convenient and comfortable, and it's more or less the same price as other hotels of the same class.",hong kong,"yvonne06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>hong kong</strong>",122,5.0

One of the standard airport buses goes directly to the Marriott Courtyard from Narita, which is a huge point as the airport is so far away and the city is massive so getting from point to point isn’t easy.

It’s fairly easy to get a taxi right our front and all the taxi drivers know where the hotel is, which is another big plus if you don’t speak Japanese. My only negative was that, it’s not possible to get a Japanese meal past 9:00pm. Although there are two restaurants in the basement floor, neither seats people nor serves after 9.

My coworkers picked the Courtyard because it seemed like it would be in a good location and he wound up picking a great location. The Courtyard is in the heart of the Ginza shopping district and a few blocks away from a lot of great shopping, window shopping and restaurants. The hotel is also about a 10 to 15 minute walks to the famous Tsukiji fish market. The fish market offers free admission to the Tuna auction. However the Auction is only open to the first 120 people and you have to get there before % am. We woke up early and got there about 15 minutes before 5 and it was already full but there is a whole market area outside of the fish market which has stalls with food stands, fresh fish, and ceramic plates, cups etc. This is where the locals go and you can get some good stuff there. It started opening around 5 am and by 6 am it was bustling with people. The hotel is also close the Tokyo subway system and Ginza station and if you are up for a nice walk the Imperial Palace is about a 30 minute walk away. The hotel itself was very nice a functional. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We asked about stuff to see and do and they quickly came up with suggestions and information. The one thing I always like about Japan as a whole is the friendly and attentive nature of the staff at hotels and restaurants, and the Courtyard staff was very good. Overall I would recommend this place for people visiting Tokyo and want to be in the heart of the city at a very reasonably priced hotel and I would stay there again.","Suffield, Connecticut","Red-Barchetta2011</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Suffield, Connecticut</strong>",202,4.0

Otherwise, this hotel was rather disappointing, especially having in mind the price which comes up to more than $350 per night web all taxes are included. Rooms are small. So it she bathroom. This is Tokyo , so it was to be expected, but still.... There is no free wireless internet. I always thought it was ironic that the cheaper the hotel is, the more amenities you have (such as free breakfast and free internet, and vice versa). Only free wireless is near the front desk and the connection was frequently lost. No pool either. Staff is helpful, but condescending. The most annoying thing is that for the first 3 days they only gave us one room key (3 of us in the room), and although we kept asking for a second key (which btw is just a card key that they will charge 1000 yen for if you lose it!!!), they kept telling us that they have no cards available to give us as a spare key. That meant that my whole family had to return to the hotel if one person wanted to take the afternoon nap, because of the key. The elevators also need a key to get to a correct floor, so either way, there is no free time to go explore Tokyo on your own, since your whole day revolves around coming back to the hotel at the same time to be able to get to your room. For a hotel that expensive, that is inexcusable. We only received the second key the last day of our stay, and were duly warned not to lose it because it is not only a rare commodity, but an expensive one to replace as well.

Note for Japan hotels - it is very common for the hotels to have wireless internet access in the lobby area ONLY, and LAN connections in the rooms.2. Note for addresses in Tokyo - in general, especially in central Tokyo, addresses are very easy to identify: the first number is like the region within the neighborhood area, second number is like the section within the region, and third number is like the 'street number'. So for the Courtyard, 6-14-10 means it is in region 6 of Ginza, section 14, and number 10 of that section.3. Note for getting around in Tokyo - bulletin board of maps are all over the place, especially in tourist heavy areas (which is pretty much everywhere), with English and Japanese marks. The subway system is also very well marked - stations are indexed and lines are color coded, making it easy for travelers from any country.4. Note for services in general - Japanese are famous for their politeness and great manners. Expect great service everywhere, and most will never accept a tip.Hotel:Location - Ginza is already a very central neighborhood of Tokyo. The Courtyard is located in a super convenient spot in Ginza, but with relative quietness away from the 'central boulevard': 2 short blocks from the main street of Ginza, 2 blocks from Hiragashi-Ginza subway stop (East-Ginza), 3 blocks from the Ginza subway stop (a major hub of the Ginza (orange) line), 10min walk to the famous Tsukiji Fish Market (although the market will be moved to another area of Tokyo later in 2012), 15min walk to the beautiful Hama-Rikyu Garden, and convenient to many other major attractions. Restaurant varieties are plenty, and certainly with many big brand names and department stores for shopping nearby.Inside - beautiful lobby, bigger guest rooms compared to other Tokyo hotels and very tastefully decorated (bed, chaise, mini-frig, narrow table, safe, drawers, sliding door closet, good size bathroom) and very well maintained (clean and fresh), free business center (printing/copying cost 20yen/page), free storage of extra luggage you don't want to put inside the rooms. Courtyard also added a great touch to install universal electrical outlets in all guest rooms, in addition to the standard 2-flat-pronged outlets Japan has. Water pressure is superb - never had this strong of water pressure before (in a good way), from both the sink and the shower. Bed is very comfortable.Service - SUPERB. Key point-winners - always enough staff at the front desk for little waiting time, great maid service (e.g. neatly put away a half-glass of leftover water adding a cover), thinking ahead for the guests by extracting stored luggage well BEFORE we went down to the lobby early in the morning on check-out day, free umbrellas for guests (no sign-in/out required, just grab and go). Bell captains are very tentative and knowledgeable.Restaurant - expensive (e.g. $23 breakfast). Did not eat at the hotel so do not know how good the food is. Room service items are very limited.Value - we paid $313 (including taxes and fees) per night. There are many other hotels in the area cost $100 less, but with smaller guest rooms or less convenient locations. IMO the value is very good for this hotel.Others - local calls 10-20yen/min, free in-room LAN internet access if you are a Marriott rewards member (~$30/nt if you are not), lobby wifi is free for everyone, simple coffee/tea in the mornings, very quiet guest rooms and hallways.","New York City, New York","LoveCity</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,4.0

I travel a lot and am a platinum member of Marriott rewards, and always hope to be treated a tint bit better becuase of that. I travel for business and have pretty simple needs. The reviews here seem to suggest that this property is a rougue member of Marriott, that the rooms are small, the staff not helpful, and the restaurants and facilities are marginal.My expereince was different. Staff was plesant and helpful. The Platinum status was recognized, if only a little. There were a few discount vouchers (10%) presented at check in, and a room change (to a queen) was accomodated without much hassle. The romm is, well, a typical Tokyo medium star hotel room. Pretty tiny and claustrophobic, but pretty new, fresh, and clean. The restaurants are wuite poor; a coffee shop on the ground floor which serves bad western food, and an overpriced Japanese restaurant on B1. But, there are plenty of nice local restaurants right outside. Yes, it's technically in Ginza, but 2-3 blocks away from the real Ginza. The fitness center was quite OK. Relatively sparten, but with pretty good equipment (Precor) and clean. The TV slelection was Japanese or BBC news. Yes, the BBC news is dubbed in Japanese, but a simple click on the bilingual button on the remote corrects that.I wish a lot of things for this hotel, and there are potentially several gripes. But in the context of middle range Tokyo hotels, it's pretty good. Staff was great. Food horrible. Location good enough. Fitness center good enough. Room, clean and fresh but tiny.Would I stay here again? 50/50. For another USD 75/night I could stay in a very nice hotel in Shinagawa (where my offices are).

Because of high real estate prices, rooms tend to be small but the rates not-so small.The first good thing about the hotel is its location. It's a 30-minute early Saturday morning limo bus ride to the hotel from Haneda airport. We could not check in so we went to the Tsukiji fish market about a 15-minute slow walk across the road where we had the obligatory sashimi breakfast. There is also a Denny's across the road and a Tully's Coffee just up the street on the left. We had breakfast in those places as the buffet breakfast was not included in our rate. Curiously, along with the card key was a discount voucher for breakfast. I never used it.Crossing back to the hotel and another easy seven minutes or so, we come to the Ginza shopping belt. And because it was a weekend, the street was closed to motor traffic. It was an amazingly calm atmosphere that made you want to linger around.The hotel itself has a reasonably attractive lobby. The marble floor is well polished, there are dark wood furniture to sit or work on. But in Asia, the lobby is not particularly awe-inspiring because it is chopped up.While we had been out exploring Ginza, the staff had taken our luggage to our room. Service was very good and there is no expectation of tips, unlike, say the USA. The room was a bit tight for three of us. They had moved a chaise lounge to one side of our queen bed and added a roller bed on the other side. There was only one chair to be used for work.The bed was very clean and comfortable and had the high thread count Egyptian cotton material. The mini-bar was reasonably stocked but there was no complimentary coffee or tea, although there were drinking cups, sugar and a kettle.The other surprise was in the toilet where mysteriously, they gave us insufficient shampoo and shower gel.The final minor quibble is the lack of English programming for the TV: it was BBC or a movie channel. As tourists spending much of our time away from the room, these are just minor quibbles. But for someone coming for business, who has to stay in the room to work, these quibbles may be major. And I should add that internet was available via ethernet cable at Y1,000 for 24 hours. There is free broadband in the lobby--fine for tourists like us, but a major hassle for a businessperson.All in all, I would recommend this hotel if the price is competitive.

This was our first visit to a Courtyard Hotel and we knew that the Courtyards were the lowest class of hotels in the Marriott group and hence we went with lower expectations. We got alot more than we expected.The Courtyard Marriott Ginza provides a high level of comfort and luxury and is really not too far quality-wise from the pure 5 star hotels. he difference is that the Courtyard provides an understated form of luxury as opposed to the over-the-top luxury of the post 5 star hotels. The hotel is simple, elegant and comfortable and it made us feel more at home compared to the big 5 stars.The room was just great - small by international standards but very generous by Japanese standards. We had 3 beds in the room. This was automatically given to us by the highly discerning check-in staff who noticed that we had 2 kids in tow and needed an extra bed.This was without any additional charge. The room had a very cosy ambiance about it. We loved the use of dark wood throughout (not sure if it was real wood but it sure looked real enough), which made the room look very elegant. The Marriott beds were, as usual, super comfortable. The bathroom was spotlessly clean and came with a large bathtub that was great for soaking. The only dissappointment was that the large flat-screen TV only had 2 English channels - BBC and a movie channel. More would have been better, especially a cartoon channel to keep the kids occupied.The Ginza location is another huge plus point. After seeing a few neighborhoods around Tokyo, I woiuld say Ginza is the best place to stay in. There are big shopping boulevanrds with lots of high-end shops, bright neon lights and big crowds but there are also lots of smaller streets that are quiet, clean and quaint. These are dotted with lots of small shops adn restaurants. Its very relaxing to walk around the streets of Ginza browsing or looking for a place to ear. Definitely one of the most relaxing places I've been to inside a big city.The transport connections are another strength of the hotel. The airport bus stops right in front of the hotel (take the bus from Stop No. 7 at Narita airport). There are 3 subway stations close by - Higashi Ginza is a 2 minute walk to the left as you exit the front door, Ginza station is 5 minutes away and the Shinbashi station is perhaps 10 minutes away. First timers travelling on the subway will have a hard time at first because all the instructions seem to be in Japanese.This hotel would be perfect if it had a pool for those hot summer days in Tokyo and could do with more English channels. On the other had it has a business center with free internet, which many big name hotels don't provide free of charge.The Courtyard Marriott Ginza is really exceptional and is among the very best city hotels I've come across because of its comfort and convenience. It is my only choice of hotel in Tokyo.",hk,"rabbitloverHk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>hk</strong>",75,5.0

On my third stay at this hotel (in June-July 2010), I managed to get an upgrade to the premium floor. These comments are about the premium rooms plus a few additions/changes to hotel policies.Premium rooms are on the 11th (top) floor. These rooms are approximately 30% larger than the standard guest rooms. Major differences are: 1) bathrooms are twice as large and they come with a Western-style commode (no electronics); 2) there's a wide hallway between the bathroom and the closet; 3) there's a very large WALK-IN closet with a motion-sensitive light; 4) larger flat-panel TV (but still not much to watch for non-Japanese guests); 5) TV is in a separate cabinet with fridge underneath, leaving room for a separate desk area. The furniture is the same overall quality as standard rooms (cheap-looking laminate). Overall, the premium floor rooms are large and comfortable enough for two people, with ample storage and desktop space.In response to earlier comments from April, the rooms DO have air conditioning, and the AC worked fine despite the scorching summer heat. It's just that the entire hotel switches between heating and air conditioning on a seasonal basis. It's quite possible that they don't switch the air conditioning system on until late spring.The Ginza Courtyard no longer offers free breakfast to Marriott Rewards Gold/Platinum Elite members. That's rather unfortunate. Instead, they hand out a discount breakfast coupon for either hotel restaurant (discount from 2,450 to 1,800 Yen). Unlike Marriott and Renaissance hotels, there are no free internet privileges for Elite members - it's still 1,000 Yen a night and a rather slow connection. Fortunately, there is still free wireless in the lobby area as long as you can stand the smoke ...... which brings me to my only complaint about this hotel. The hotel allows smoking in one corner of the lobby, near the gift shop. They also allow smoking in the basement bar. The smoke permeates the entire lobby area and wafts up the elevator shafts to all floors. I do understand Marriott's non-smoking policy is optional outside the US and Canada at this time, and I hope the Ginza Courtyard adopts it soon. The Marriott in Nagoya, for instance, does not allow smoking in their lobby.Finally, I was told that the rooms will undergo a renovation later this summer. Not sure when the renovation will begin and what it would encompass.","Palo Alto, CA","Mooneydriver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palo Alto, CA</strong>",68,4.0

I found this hotel to be absolutely fantastic. The first thing you have to remember is that you are not in the U.S., so hotel rooms are always smaller and we expected this. Having said that, the room was well appointed and very clean. Take the airport limousine (it's really a bus) right to the front door for $30 US. We heard another couple took a taxi from the airport and it cost over $200 US. The airport limousine is always on time (of course) and very clean with good service from the staff.You’ll be very comfortable in this hotel; the neighborhood is very nice, there are several convenience stores within a block or two and the subway is a five minute walk. We found the subway easy to navigate and got us to all of the popular sightseeing spots without the use of a taxi once. There are also many restaurants in the neighborhood and the fish market is about a 15 minute walk from the hotel (get up early to see the tuna auction at 5AM!).The two complaints I have about this hotel are the TV and the air conditioning. I was there in cooler weather so only one night did it get warm in the room but I did notice there was no way to turn on the air conditioning and I have read other reviews of the hotel in warmer weather where guests definitely found the air conditioning to be an issue. The other issue was the TV (and this is a small issue). We definitely were not there to watch TV, we were out sightseeing all day and night, but when you're getting ready in the morning or dozing off at night and want something on in the background there is only one English speaking channel (BBC) which runs its stories on a loop. This got old very fast.Notwithstanding the air conditioning issues my complaints were very minor.Pros - Clean, Neat Hotel - Very close to subway - Nice neighborhood - Airport Limousine stops right out front (last stop) - More reasonably priced than other Tokyo hotelsCons - Air Conditioning (if true, wasn't there in hot weather) - Only one English TV channel",USA,"markonline007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",15,4.0

So if you'd like to *see* what the hotel and room look like, check it out here: http://yelloww.net/blog/2010/03/courtyard-by-marriott-tokyo-ginza-review/I booked a standard queen size room, and checked in to room 1008 on the 10th floor. I asked at the front desk about the possibility of an upgraded room and was told that all of the rooms on the executive floor were already booked. As a platinum member I chose the welcome gift, of “Orange Juice, Fruit, and Japanese cake.”The room itself was small by typical American standards, but huge by Tokyo standards . Some of the interesting touches included the two Japanese style robes on top of the bed, and a cool lighting control panel next to the bed that can be used to turn on and off all of the lights in the room. Many Japanese hotels still use metal “keys” for the room — the courtyard does one better, and has RFID key-cards that you simply touch to the door to unlock it.The room also had a medium size work desk, flat panel television, sofa/chair thing, and a mini-bar refrigerator. I found the room to be nice and quiet — very important for me!The bathroom, like most Japanese hotels, had a toilet with a Japanese bidet seat. The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries including toothbrushes, toothpaste, hair brushes, and two *individually wrapped* cotton swabs.The only real negative for the Courtyard is that the air conditioning and heat is either on or off for the whole hotel. When I was there in December, it was a pretty warm day, and the room was a bit too warm for my tastes — but no air conditioning was available because the hotel was seat for “heat” and not A/C. At least the window in room opened so I could get some fresh air that way.Getting from the Courtyard to the airport is a snap, as there is a Limousine bus that picks up in front of the Courtyard every hour bound for Narita. 3000 Yen, and well worth it! Location wise the Courtyard is a pretty central area in Ginza — just a few blocks from the Higashi-Ginza metro stop, and right across the street from an AM/PM and a Denny’s.Overall I highly recommend the Courtyard, it’s quiet, centrally located, and relatively inexpensive for an American chain hotel in Tokyo.",San Diego,"YellowProductions</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",89,4.0

I travel to Tokyo 8-10 times per year for business. Although I can stay anywhere I want, I do not select hotels that are more than $250.00 per night in Tokyo. I usually stay at Prince Park Tower or Akasaka. Since I am a 4th year Marriott Platinum member, I gave this hotel a try. I must tell you that I was not too impressed after paying $250+/night for almost a week. Especially during such a bad economy in Japan, US, etc.Platinum treatment – At the check in, they recognized my status properly and offered special amenities. It was very nicely done.Rooms and upgrades – Upgrade was not offered and I didn’t get to stay at the premium floor (11th). 4 straight year Platinum member should receive such upgrades but they didn’t offer one. I made my reservation 2 month before the trip therefore having no such availability would be an excuse to me.Standard size rooms (Tokyo standard) and was comfortable. Extremely small desk. No view where I stayed. Although it was located in busy Ginza district, it was quiet.Bathroom was acceptable but not great.Air conditioning – I were there in mid-January, during the day my room was too warm due to warmer than usual weather in Tokyo. Cold air was turned off and only had non-cooled air circulating in the building. When I pointed it out, the management offered a fan which helped little bit. If it was during the summer, it would not be acceptable.Exercise facility – Was acceptable and everything there was working.Service – Ok but not great for Japanese hotel standard.Internet - They charge you 1000 yen per 24hrs. Courtyard in US and other countries does not charge for Internet. I guess Japan is different. Transportation – Airport Limo Bus stops at the door. Last stop if you are coming from Narita. BTW, if you are a newbie traveling to Tokyo, DO NOT TAKE taxi from Narita to Tokyo. It will cost you US$300-$400 guaranteed. Airport Limo Bus is clean, comfortable and will only cost you 3000yen.Bell staff – Great! Promptly greeted me with smile. There was a young Japanese (and good English) speaking Indian native girl on the bell staff and she was just delightful in many ways. That’s the only great thing I remember about this hotel.Final bill – I was charged a different rate (WITHOUT explanation) than the reservation I made through Marriott.com.Next time, I am in Tokyo, I will most likely stay elsewhere. However, I would not mind going back to this hotel if they have a special rate around US$150/night. That would be the maximum amount I would pay for Courtyard Ginza.","Austin, Texas","JoeA-Austin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",19,3.0

On my return one night, I found my shopping bag left on the table gone. On initial clarification with the hotel, they were quite adamant that housekeeping would only throw away items placed beside the dustbin. They concluded after investigation that the housekeeping staff accidentally threw away my bag (& can no longer be found) together with the empty bottle beside. When I further wrote in to Marriot, they reminded me that I could use the hotel safe for storage of valuables. IMO, the item was by no means valuable as it only contained other shopping bags I intended to keep but it made me doubt the security of the hotel. Did the housekeeping staff peeped (at personal items) and concluded there was nothing ""valuable"" inside? What if I had not unpacked the stuff I bought? When I enquired about benefits for the Marriotts Gold program I was misinformed by the check-in staff there was no entitlement at a Courtyard hotel. I found out later that I would be entitled to a room upgrade if it had been available. And my preference for a double/ Kings bed was not given.",Mumbai,"ydis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai</strong>",17,3.0
