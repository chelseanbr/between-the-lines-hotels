It was my birthday trip!Unfortunately, the Covid-19 pandemic hit and we had stay at place orders here in California and Hawaii also had strict quarantine orders. We had to cancel our trip.Unfortunately, I placed the reservation through a third party website (I will not name them, but they are horrendous to deal with) and the refused to refund me. Fine, I figured I would deal directly through the hotel.I called and was greeted by Rene. I explained to him my situation and requested to see if I could get a voucher to use my stay at a later date. He said he could definitely work with me and told him he would call me back. He called me back and did some research - Apparently, Equus didn't charge the website, and they never got any money from the transaction. He gave me his name and told me to call the company to request for a refund. If they had any questions about it, he would talk to them on my behalf.What fantastic customer service! I really appreciate Rene for being so upfront and helpful with me. I will definitely stay with them when I do rebook a trip to Waikiki. Unfortunately, I was not able to get my money back with the third party website, but I was able to get a credit on the account. I will try to use the credit with them or I will go directly through the hotel to book next time.","Sacramento, California","starriclouds</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",0,5.0

We spoke to Chad at the front desk and he was very helpful in finding us a beautiful suite in the hotel. It did have some street noise, but was very comfortable. The next morning we spoke to Rene at the front desk. She was the best!! We were put into a quiet room down the hall and Linelle had it sparkling and smelling fresh!

I was awoken often, thinking the vehicle was actually in my room. The street noise is deafening. The only thing that helped cover up the noise from the traffic is the loud commotion and music from the bar. The air conditioning was powerful, so it was either freezing cold, or turned off and hot in our room. The “Resort Fee” is actually $25/day, not $20/day as advertised on their website.

I had the pleasure of getting to know many of the staff and literally all of them were so friendly and genuine, it truly was one of the top highlights of my entire experience in Hawaii. Both Puka and Rene who greet you upon checkin are simply amazing and super accommodating. They are both lifelong locals that know the area inside and out and are incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. The staff at the coffee/breakfast bar-Jen & Lynda-are also extremely friendly and wow do they make amazing coffee, paninis and pastries available in the morning! The bar coverts to a cocktail bar in the later afternoon/evening and the evening staff-Lana, Bailey & Rory are super chill and exude the true Aloha spirit serving up locally made rums, beers and sodas (I no longer drink alcoholic beverages so went with some locally made cola which was amazing). They specialize in all things local and were the first hotel on Oahu to go green:) The valet staff-Roy & Dwayne-are very quick and helpful. Even the housekeeping staff that I met-Teddy & Jackie-were excellent and great at paying attention to detail-something that’s important to me. The Equus is also the last locally owned hotel left in Waikiki and I’m sure that’s another reason they are so much like family. Sadly I wasn’t able to bring my babies (chow chows) with me on this trip but they are also pet friendly for those that do:>~The equestrian theme is really a nice touch and I learned that in the spring guests get VIP passes for free to polo matches at the polo club the same family owns on the North Shore! When I return to Oahu, I won’t even consider any other hotel. Just really love this place❤️","Tucson, Arizona","OfficialBestOf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",8,5.0

The room was clean and beds very comfortable, temperature comfortable.Additionally, I am a architect so I appreciate design and clever use of spaces. This boutique hotel transformed an inbetween buildings narrow space into a welcoming cafe/bar with a equestrian deco as its entry point. Food and coffee at the cafe was very good. The design of the hotel/room is not of a modern sleek but more a vintage and comfort with good taste. The furnitures pieces in the room were gorgeous all wood antiques modified for the modern appearance even the hinges and locks all crafted of wood so you can tell its not mass produced off the shelf items.The only comments i would have for reviewers is that the pool is small, more of a dip pool which would be great to cool off after swim at the beach, but not so much for kids to play, was not welcoming for kids. During the day the pool area was cold and windy, which might work out well on a hot day to cool off for adults.One more regarding service, the stay was for few days on our flight back. We stayed at a different hotel on the initial leg of the trip. However equus allowed us to store my sons bodyboard at their storage until we checked in in a month time.

The price was cheap for the area, but the reviews and pictures they had looked worth it. My mistake. When we arrived, we had to carry our bags up a flight of stairs being that the check in is on the second floor and there is no elevator from the ground floor. Check in was easy. We then waited on the only elevator in the hotel for several minutes ( It wasn’t busy) and got to our room on the fourth floor. The door was wide open and the furniture was piled in the beds and a fan was trying to air out the room. I had my family wait while I went back down to the front desk. I was told it shouldn’t have been available as it was under maintenance but in the system it was. Got another room, went there and checked it out before going back to get my family just in case. The room looked like the pictures except in the pictures they must have used another source of lighting to make it look homier. The bathroom was on the small side but manageable. The tv was on when I entered the room but you couldn’t change the channel. This was resolved with no issue. The beds and carpet is where the problem is. The carpet looks like original carpeting. Rarely cleaned and there were stains on it. The bed, which is labeled as double pillow top mattresses felt like I was laying on pillows with springs in them. More like a big full size bed. If you have two small children, they’re fine. Two adults not fine. We were there for 3 nights and barely got any sleep. This was the result of the bed and the constant street noise. Very busy area, which I understand, but the walls and door to the hallway are paper thin. The best part of the hotel is the Paniolo bar and HI brew cafe, same place just different hours. Everyone in the hotel was friendly, so they aren’t the problem. I believe the management needs to spend a night in a room to see what they can improve on. Major tune up needed.",,rmore71,1,2.0

The room and hotel were better than expected, the location was great for the price, and the price just couldn't be beat. It was a bit of a walk to the beach, but definitely doable. Seriously. The only thing I didn't like was the size of the shower, but that wasn't bad enough to make me give a bad review.However, 3 days after checking out, I noticed 9 additional charges to my credit card all made on various days during my stay. I called the hotel to ask what was going on, but was met with hostility and did not receive any explanation.The hotel's policy is to charge you a deposit at booking, then charge the remainder on check in. This all went smoothly. On check out, we weren't notified of owing any additional monies, nor were we given a receipt, so these charges were totally unexpected. When I called, I was told that the two $20 charges that went through were resort fees and not to worry about the other 7 charges because they were declined. I explained that they wouldn't have been if my card would've had the money on it, and asked again to know why the charges were even attempted. Aside from the two $20 charges, all of the others were in various amounts from $50 to $160. She asked me the dates, I told her, but she said she couldn't tell me why the attempts were made because she wasn't working those days. I asked her to find out who was and have them call me, to which she replied that she was the manager and again tried to tell me I didn't need to worry about the charges because they were declined. I ended up hanging up on her because she got increasingly defensive and rude, and kept talking over me. I never got any resolution, nor an answer as to why the random charges were attempted. After the conversation, I emailed asking for my receipt and received it. (I'm sure it's the same person I talked with that emailed it to me because 2 other people were CC'd on the email.) The receipt is hard to understand and some of the charges don't make sense, but no where on it does it show that I had two days of unpaid resort fees, nor does it show any other outstanding amounts to explain ANY of the charges that were attempted, including the ones that went through.Since they could never explain why the charges were attempted, I feel I should probably just cancel my card since I can't be sure they won't make more random attempts.","Lexington, South Carolina","Sadaras C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lexington, South Carolina</strong>",1,2.0

So i didn't do my customary Trip Advisor check of the Hotel before booking. First impression: We were greeted by wonderful young men who were Valet Parking, 10/10 for them. Not too happy that we have to then negotiate 17 steps up to the lobby area.We checked in around 1pm, our room wasn't ready yet (which is totally understandable) We went off for many hours and returned after dinner. our suitcases had not been delivered. We call the reception and ask for delivery. We receive our luggage minus 2 back packs which were delivered to another room in error.we note the room is nice enough, bed is big and comfy. but on closer inspection there is dust on lampshades, chair rails, all flat surfaces. I grab a wet cloth and wipe down the counter near the coffee machine and it is flithy. i check the shower, also filthy, mould on the grout and floor is grimey. there is a safe, but it came off Noah's ark, it had no key and was locked, i called reception and asked for a key, i was told all the $$$$'s it would cost me if i lost the key, then the key was delivered. then turned on the TV, batteries were flat, so had to put in a call to reception( for the 3rd time and i only arrived half an hour ago)to have batteries delivered, which they promptly did. the roads are incredibly noisy, and the sliding glass door is so thin, it felt like there was no door at all, it was so noisy. Speaking of which, i could not open the sliding glass door. it had a dodgy bolt, but even when i managed to open it, the door would not slide.for the next 2 days we put a Do Not Disturb sign on our door, but that didn't stop the housekeeping from entering our room. surely this is an invasion of our privacy.on the 3rd night, the fire alarm went off in our room for no reason, we were sound asleep and it went off... we didn't know what it was at the time, as we were deep in sleep, and to be woken to the screaming sound... we were in a shocked state to say the least. the thing was situated less than 5 feet from our bed.we had the battery taken out and asked they not fix it until we left 2 days later.upon checking out, we asked for a nights discount as it was totally ruined because of the disturbance and we could not go back to sleep, but the person checking us out could not do that, all he offered to do was to take of the ""Resort Fee"" of $20 a day.....not satisfactory if you ask me. And Resort fee???? for a tiny little pool squeezed in behind the bar area... I cant believe they charge $20 a day for that.so to sum up...Staff are wonderful, Valet Parking guys..Fantastic. Room dusty and dirty (room 603) shower mouldy and grimey and 17 steps is a long way to drag your suitcase. no, not happy at all.","Brisbane, Australia","KarenTrevorSm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",27,2.0

Prideful of its background linked to historic O’ahu Polo games, fortunately it’s only about a block away, walking distance, from Waikiki beach. Rooms are very nice, very clean, up-to-date electronics but with vintage wooden furniture, very cozy bed. Staff is out of this world! Made our stay 10x better than anticipated. Reneé, our front desk concierge and O’ahu native, treated us like Hawaiian royalty as well as any housekeeping and maintenance staff we encountered. Reneé dubbed us family immediately and let us in on awesome local tips as well as some practical O’ahu “do’s and do-not’s”. Almost each evening of our honeymoon week we returned to our room to find heartwarming gifts left for us by the staff: wine, champagne, thank you cards, etc. The staff and their vibes really made us feel at home as opposed to the fluorescent, corporate feel of a luxury resort. This place is perfect blend of 5 star service with a native O’ahu ambience. Hotel is extremely eco-friendly with power saving guidelines and recycling. There is a nice, clean mid sized pool on lower level with patio cabana. Another huge perk is the outdoor/patio cafe/bar downstairs known as ‘The Paniolo Cafe @ The Equus’. This is laid back patio bar with great signature cocktails and a nice selection of local/national beers and wines. There is also an amazing locally brewed coffee and a great selection of pastries and brunch food items. Each day was a different server/bartender, but each one was just as awesome and friendly as the previous. Kelly, Bailey and Rory each treated us with the upmost kindness and respect and were very welcoming as well as knowledgeable in local fun facts and adventure ideas. Mahalo guys!!! These 3 individuals just added to our already awesome vacation. All in all, we would most definitely return here.

Upon check in, I inquired, and Reception indeed had to change our room for us. “No problem!” So we headed to our new room # 607. It didn’t matter! Street noise (through closed sliders and running a/c) was a problem. While the room itself was ok, (bed comfy, nice tv, Keurig coffee maker) the carpets were stained, and the bathroom shower tiles seemed dirty. Oh, and our room was never serviced for the 3 day stay. We would leave the room around 10 am, and return around 2-3pm, never even seeing a housekeeper on our floor until the morning of our check out. Maybe they do late housekeeping?? Possibly this was due to the hotel workers strike in Honolulu?? Whatever the reason, it just didn’t seem right, or up to Ascend or Choice standards.

The layout of the room, is well thought out, plenty of space to move about (including the spacious washroom), a bar fridge with drink prep station on the counter above, extremely plush beds and lounge seating, an entertainment centre, and your room specific complementary WiFi access. The theme of the hotel (Polo, Horses, and Hawaii), is maintained throughout, with personal touches from the owners. I slept undisturbed, all night, in the completely occupied hotel.

Rooms, linens and bathrooms are clean and look to have been updated fairly recently.It has a Paniolo theme, paying respects to the First cowboys to Hawai'i from Portugal. Plenty of of photos with tons of history!!Easy walk to Waikiki Beach and easier walk to Ala Moana Mall. The esspresso bar in the lobby is on point. Yummy coffee, and goodies sold all day. Puka at the front desk was a gem! We were misinformed about the airport shuttle, but he made sure we got all starightened out, and then called me to make sure we made it to the airport ok.

It was so hot we had trouble sleeing for the 3 nights we stayed at Equus. It seems in some rooms the power supply which runs the airconditioner is shared with the adjoining room thereby reducing output. We set the temperature to the coldest setting but that made it worse and we were advised to leave it on the default setting. We asked for help several times and staff visited to try to make improvements but no real change. Even a standing fan would have helped but none were available.

We are a very practical family that sees the hotel as primarily a place to sleep and the location and cleanliness tend to be our top concern. That said...Pros: - Location. It is not on the beach but very close - easy walking distance to restaurants, beaches, shopping. Since the room has a fridge, we shopped a block down at the ABC store for incidentals.- Friendly staff - seemed like they liked their jobs- My most telling praise is would I stay here again. Yes.You should know: - It is not a new big chain hotel with an ocean view. You will find some things in your room that have been repaired. Our room had several patches on the ceiling. - It does have a set of steps you will have to overcome with your luggage in order to reach the elevator.- The decor is not modern. Attempts were made to make it more rustic to fit the theme kinda' like a B&B. This means that some of the furniture pieces are, in fact, older. Since each room is unique, do not expect the room you get to match the traveler's pictures.Needs improvement:- Put some more hooks in the bathroom to hang things PLEASE- I read in a review response that: ""$11.00 per day, it includes Wi-Fi, daily in room coffee & tea, use of beach towels & chairs and a ""wiki wiki"" breakfast which includes muffins and fruits"". While we were told about the towels and did take advantage of the Wi-Fi and coffee; we did not know about the ""chairs"". Nor did we know about the ""wiki wiki"" breakfast - that would have save us some trips to the ABC and McD's...and some money. Perhaps this was written in some literature that we should have read but when you are hotel-jumping it is difficult to keep track of which hotel provides which amenities.

Hadn't been here for 30 years. Found the hotel online and what a find. This ""boutique "" hotel dead opposite of sterile, modern generic highrises. Greeted personally on arrival at 7am by the lovely welcoming Rene. She , like most of the staff, has been here for decades in this family owned hotel. Despite the early hour, she found me a room to sleep off my 10 hrs plane trip.Rooms and beds very comfortable with fridge and excellent coffee maker provided. Absolutely spotless. Plenty of places to sit in lobby, pool area, bar, to chat to people. All staff, especially bartenders, incredibly friendly and helpful- providing lots of info about things to do and places to go. As a result, guests also chat away with those from other parts of the world. Location is superb with easy walking access to shops, restaurants, beach. The only drawback is proximity to very busy road so traffic noise pretty continuous. However, I am a very light sleeper but was given a room as far away from street as possible which was fine.If you want a completely different Waikiki experience from the standard provided to millions of tourists, at a very reasonable price, this is the place to stay.","Christchurch, New Zealand","wichdr01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",11,4.0

The interior is old and worn, in my opinion should be replaced long time ago. Moreover, the staff does not use any scent inside the hotel. The only thing you could smell was dust and hot air. I would expect from Hawaiian hotel a pleasant, floral scent at least in the main lobby. The room itself was average, moderately clean and very dark. Sliding door was difficult to use/lock. Toilet and shower were tiny, which didn't bother me. Problematic guests were another issue. Terrible screams were heard at night. Happily, I did not find any bugs in my bed.

Since I am also a Choice member, I was pleased to see that The Equus Hotel was affiliated with Choice so I figured I would give it a shot. I will admit that I was a little skeptical at first, but my mind was put at ease shortly after my arrival. PROS:The location is great. Right on the outside of downtown Waikiki so you aren't going to be blasted with all the noise coming from the hustle and bustle from the street below. Easy walking distance to the beach, downtown and the Ala Moana mall and surrounding shopping areas. Room: My accommodations were very comfortable. One of the nicest beds I've had the pleasure of sleeping on in a long time. Room size was ample and by far exceeded my needs. Bathroom and shower was a little smaller than I would have liked, but you can't necessarily have everything. Amenities: Love the morning coffee in the room and downstairs in the lobby. Jen is extremely friendly and provides the utmost in customer service. She makes a mean latte too! In the afternoon, Matt the bartender does a fantastic job! Very attentive to the guests and knowledgeable about the area, things to do, places to visit and where to have a good time. Made the best Pisco Sour I have had in a long time. Only one better was in Chile'. CONS: If I had to list anything, the only things I could really gripe about would be the elevator. It gets a little creaky around the 7th floor, but I never felt unsafe in it. I will admit that $25 a day parking with valet only is a little bothersome, but far from a showstopper. There was one afternoon when I returned from work to find no valet in sight, but Kika (the manager on duty) was quick to assist me and address the situation. If you can find a better option for parking in Waikiki, be my guest, because every place in town charges for parking, but you are going to miss out on what really makes this hotel something special......the people. The staff here was fantastic. From Mike and Mariah, to Kika and Matt, Jen, the valets and all the hotel staff, there is a true sense of family which is what makes The Equus my new hotel of choice in the Honolulu area .","Oak Harbor, Washington","cotto11teen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oak Harbor, Washington</strong>",5,5.0

I had booked months in advance, online, and gotten a great rate, but without the ability to change or cancel as a result. I called the hotel and spoke with Rene, and she gave me a full refund anyway, because of the very unfortunate circumstances.

We were amazed we could still even get a room on a budget so late in the game. We only needed a place to sleep for the night and freshen up in between our activities without worrying about parking in Waikiki. This was our first stay at Equus for everyone in our party.Parking: Valet only. There was a little confusion with the parking situation; however, we resolved everything within a couple of minutes.Check-in: We were greeted by a Keurig buffet. When our attention focused back to checking in, we were a little confused with the check-in station; however, quickly figured out it was the gentleman sitting at the furthest corner of the room on a teeny stool and table with a laptop. We had a difficult time deciphering who were employees and who were patrons with the exception of the maintenance workers. By the way, great job buffering out the brass on the staircase!Room: upon entering the room, we were greeted to an Equestrian atmosphere with a wonderfully cool room, clean towels, nice array of complimentary toiletries and complimentary entrails in the toilet, a Keurig greeted us along with some complimentary cookies and several antenna friends (expected in a tropical environment), as well as a little refrigerator (had to ask for ice from the front counter), new flat screen television, nice digital radio/time clock, and neatly set beds. We were aiming for a suite; however, it was already booked, so Equus arranged to allow us the use of two conjoining rooms with a door in between the rooms. The conjoining door was still locked upon our arrival; however, two friendly maintenance men came within a couple of minutes to unlock the door for us. On a side note, for those of you who enjoy a nice, hot shower, the water gets nice and hot. I also appreciated the ample electrical socket availability. They were easily accessible from several sides of the room.Pool: We were unable to get to the pool area because it looked like there was some minor renovation going on near the entrance of the pool area. Whatever is being built looks very nice and looks to be just about ready to use. I hear it may be the home of their future bar. The pool being blocked did not matter because the beach is located right across the street.Check-out: We got an early start the next day and were greeted to complimentary muffins in the lobby/check-in/out area. We decided to catch a quick breakfast at a near by restaurant, then catch some beach time before checking out. Check-out was fairly quick and easy.I felt like the Equus staff were family members running a family owned business. In all, we ran into a few minor hiccups which were all resolved quickly. The stay was reasonably priced especially on such short notice. We had a decent bed to sleep on and a cool room to cool us off in the humid summer heat. It was a bonus to have the conjoining door to our rooms so we could still spend time as a group as originally planned plus we didn't have to share beds. ;-) I cannot speak for the rest of the group; however, I would not mind returning for a quick and reasonably priced stay in Waikiki.",,veek25,0,4.0

Our room request was met - lower floor and away from elevators and vending machines! Many tourist spots were within walking distance including an ABC Store!! Though we'd been to Honolulu a number of times, this was our first to attempt our 'tourist-ing' on The Bus.

The room had a bar area with a sink, Keurig single cup coffee maker, and mini refrigerator which kept our beverages icy cold. So nice to have an ice cold beverage after walking and riding the bus around the area. The only mark against the Equus is the walk up from the street to the lobby; there is no 'lift'.

The Equus came up as a place that was reasonably close (only a little over 2 miles away on a single main road) to the campus as well as the off-campus house she would be renting with others on her team near the University of Hawaii (also less than 2 miles in a different direction.) The Equus is situated very close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center, the Honolulu Yacht Harbor and the Ala Moana Beach Park, all of which are within walking distance. This is a plus, because one of the things we were not prepared for is the $25 mandatory daily valet parking fee at the hotel. The reason for this is completely understandable giving the location of the hotel squeezed into a compact area between a number of other residential and vacation buildings. However, this needs to be not only taken into account as a cost factor, but also as a logistics factor as it can take up to 10 or 15 minutes during busy times for the valet runners to be able to get your vehicle. Make sure to allot yourself enough time if you need to be anywhere at a certain hour.The staff at the front desk were awesome every time we had contact with them. Upon arrival, the lady who greeted us was extremely friendly and helpful, and even offered my daughter a flower lei of the same school color for Hawaii Pacific University. A very generous and appreciated touch. Another time I let the front desk know that our room needed service and the gentleman had someone at our room within 5 minutes.The room we had with the hotel's equestrian themed décor was suitable for our stay, but be aware that this is an older hotel. It has one elevator which was not in service at one point during one brief period during the week, which could be a significant problem if you are on one of the higher floors. A big consideration for staying here is that we did miss having a kitchen and clothes washing capabilities which we have been accustomed to in previous condominium stays. Take this into account, as eating out every meal in Hawaii is expensive, and we took advantage of the small refrigerator to store food from the grocery store as often as possible. There are a couple of nearby laundry service options, one of which is a little more clean than the other, but both are within 1/2 a mile walk from the hotel. We found it necessary to use services twice, because of the heat and humidity and the fact that Fabreze only works so well in these conditions.The Equus does have a pool, but it is small an in an area which receives little to no sun. (As a side note, in late 2017 they are doing work to add a small bar area to the hotel which made access to this pool problematic at various times.) If you are looking for a pool for children or to lay out at, this one does not really fit the bill. Fortunately, it is a less than 15 minute walk to the Ala Moana Beach Park directly across the street from the shopping center of the same name, and this is a nice beach area with lifeguard stations.Taking a small walk north to the Ala Moana Shopping Center will give you a large number of food choices, including sit down restaurants and a large, central food court with about 20 places to choose from. The only downside of this is that, along with much of this part of Oahu the number of homeless in the area is stunning. Most of them are harmless and will not bother you, but during our week's stay we were followed or subjected to uncomfortable verbal displays at least three times. This, obviously, has absolutely NOTHING to do with the Equus hotel, but is a factor for any visitation in the area.In summary, our stay had no frills, but this hotel served our need functionally for the week and we were able to accomplish getting our daughter set up for her semester at HPU successfully.",Here,"Greg L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Here</strong>",8,4.0

From the minute we made our arrangements on the phone to the moment we left to head home, the warmth and true ""aloha"" spirit was given with each interaction we had. I can't say enough about Rene...she is old time Hawai`i at it's best. Guests become `ohana (family) and here in the Hawaiian Islands, that means everything. Our Senior Softball League team stayed at the Equus Hotel in early August. The rooms were pleasant but not as luxurious as some hotels down the street. The guest rooms could use a total refresh but as we were not there much, they were adequate for what we needed. The bathrooms were clean and tidy and the hotel provided the full range of shampoo conditioner, lotion and clean towels every day. The housekeepers did a great job on the rooms! One of the other things that we appreciated is that The Equus Hotel is locally owned. So much of the Hawaiian Islands is becoming overrun with visitors, big box stores, and other Mainland entities. When I can find a locally owned business that offers such great guest service, that is going to be my first choice each and every time I have to be in Honolulu. Life is simple here.

We stayed at the Equus for six nights of our two week vacation. Firstly, I will lay out the positives so it doesn't seem like I didn't give this place a chance. Believe me, I have a very calm and optimistic personality so I really wanted to have a great time. The price was reasonable for its location, quick walk to Ala Moana shopping mall, a quick bus ride to Waikiki beach, a lovely evening stroll to the public lagoon, and an ABC store just a stones throw from the hotel. It was pretty good. I loved our king sized bed and we didn't mind the noise pollution invading our dreams every morning. We decided this was a good fit. It was affordable to sleep, shower and store our luggage here, whilst we explored Waikiki and the island throughout the day, often returning late in the night. I have to admit, it started off well. However, the pool was closed the entire time we stayed, Disappointing. The shower was very small and narrow, Disappointing, and worst of all; on my final night, as I was packing my luggage, I noticed a number of items missing from our room. These items were purchased four days prior and I packed them ever so carefully in our hotel room. I live in Australia and found a woman in Hawaii who custom made these items. As I had travelled to Waikiki especially to purchase these items. I was stoked to have tracked her down and purchased them. I carefully packed them and stored them out of the way. When I discovered them missing I was beside myself with confusion and overwhelmed with emotion. Our room was locked every morning with only cleaning staff coming in every day. When I brought it to the attention of hotel staff I was promised an enquiry. Apparently someone looked in the bins. I was so overwhelmed and heartbroken I cried to staff for a solution, but no other remedy/compensation was presented. I spent the night feeling utterly betrayed. Early the next morning I checked with them again for help. They did not get back to me until after lunch time and by then I had two hours until I had to fly out, it was not enough time and I did not have the budget to buy a second lot of items. My request to those considering The Equus Hotel- Do not stay here if you have items of value. If they go missing, you will not get them back. I have returned to Australia with a sad reminder of my vacation in Waikiki. I wish things had not turned out this way but I would not recommend this place to anyone. A simple apology will not do.

When we expressed our disappointment they offered a $25 room credit. We said that wasn't enough to cover the lack of pool for the entire trip and they increased the credit to $25/night. The air conditioner in the room was not very cold at all. They sent maintenance up to check it out and he said it was just an old unit, and this is as cold as it got. Upon check out with Yoshi we discovered that he had locked the keys to the office inside the office. This is where the valet car keys are locatted. He tried to break the door down to get in, he tried to call other co-workers to see if anyone else had a key. Finally i suggested calling a locksmith. The lock smith showed up and was able to unlock the door so he could get the keys, but in all the confusion Yoshi had lost the key tag that identified which set of keys belonged to our rental car. Finally, we found them and took off in a mad rush to the airport so we did not miss our flight. We ended up having to retrieve our own car because the valet worker hadn't shown up for work yet.... it was 6:30 & he was supposed to be there at 6:00. I really wanted to like this hotel.

First let me say, the place is very clean. The staff are extremely friendly, no complaints what's so ever. The location is good, it's a short walk (8 mins at most) to the lagoon at Hilton Village and beach. You can also easily walk to Ala Moana Center, very upscale indoor/ outdoorish mall. Now onto the things that will annoy you. The rooms are small, but workable. The decor is looking dated. The bed was super comfy actually, so no issue there. Has a small fridge, no microwave . The bathroom has small shower, very motel 6 esq. Now onto the balconies!! The issue here is, that the AC units are located in the balcony area above your head, and blow heat on you, so it gets hot out there. The room AC is good though. Next up, Pool, it's basically just there for the brochure pictures. It gets no sunlight, small, cold, I never used it. (The hotel should rip it out and put hot tubs if you ask me.) Overall impressions, usually boutique in a hotel name provokes images of modern, exposed concrete, trendy room, open concept, etc.. this hotel is not that. What it is in its current state, is standard clean room. Good location, that is it. It's not a bad place at all, it just needs a remodel.","Bronx, New York","Atalley77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bronx, New York</strong>",5,3.0

We chose the Equus for its location close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and proximity to Waikiki Beach. As we weren't planning to spend a lot of time in the room we didn't feel that we needed a five star hotel. We were not disappointed. The room was a little old-fashioned but had solid wood furniture (unusual in a modern hotel) and a bar fridge with no minibar so you actually had room to put a few things in the fridge.The proximity of the hotel to the Ala Moana Center is handy for those who enjoy shopping but also because the shopping centre is a major transport hub for the local buses. We found the Equus to be well-placed for jumping on a local bus to go sightseeing further afield.The hotel was accommodating about our early arrival and let us check into the room immediately. I'd like to say a big thanks to the lovely Renée on reception for making us feel so welcome.The hotel doesn't have a restaurant or cafe which might be a concern for some people but there are a number of restaurants a short walk away. Access to reception is via steps and there is no lift or elevator option from street level as far as I am aware so the Equus would not be a good choice if you have mobility issues.For those who like to pick up a few groceries and take picnics during their holiday there is a supermarket at the Ala Moana Center where you can pick up everything you might need.,Melbourne,"MelbourneKaz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",38,4.0

So my family and I went to the hotel and Rene greeted us and had fix the problem I had with my booking. And because we had our grandchildren coming down to Rene had put our family room on the 2nd floor so it was easy for the kids to get to the pool. She was such an amazing women that this hotel made it feel like home. Rene was not just out there to help the tourists but also the local people. She made our Memorial Day stay so smooth and easy. It was easy to get to the floating lantern ceremony in the evening. This is one amazing hotel that do there very best to help out us local family's to. It's a family oriented hotel.

One thing that can't be helped: this is an older building in established Honolulu, and it is hard to see where you are supposed to pull in. We did pull in to the valet parking first (which is where you have to go, though no signs are posted to indicate that) but there was no attendant, in spite of the sign saying one should have been available when we got there. Confused, we ended up driving around in frustration, trying to find the correct entrance. We parked in another hotel lot and walked in, in the end, and then retrieved our car and brought it over.The entrance is up a couple flights of stairs, well away from the street, just past the valet. Park in valet and then go check in. Your car gets parked in the tower behind the hotel. For $25 nightly. Hey, it's Honolulu. You pay for parking, I guess. By the time we got to the hotel, we were very tired, and I was a little cranky. I don't like getting lost in a city I don't know at night. We got to the room and found that the lamp and clock on the nightstand weren't working, and the shower stall wasn't well cleaned.I received a survey text the following day, and when I responded with ""average,"" the manager contacted me immediately. We were told the issues with our room would be handled immediately. We were out all day that day. When we returned, the bathroom was cleaned better, and the lamp and clock were working. However, the person who had been in the room had turned on the TV and left it on, as well as all the lights in the room. We had gone on a tour at 6:30 that morning and did not return until after 6 pm, so we have no idea how long the room was left like that. It was disconcerting. The beds and pillows were comfortable. We were hardly there except to sleep and shower. The shower stall is very small, though. The manager did respond quickly to our requests. However, it was uncomfortable to wonder about who was in our room and how long they were there when we came back to everything turned on. I'm not sure we would book here again.

I was a little concerned about the hotel, knowing its and older, smaller property. When I arrived, in the early evening, on a Sunday, I was pleasantly surprised.The location for me was great. At the west edge of Waikiki, it's close enough for me to do dome walking and exploring but not stuck in the middle of the congestion that can be Waikiki. From the lobby, the renovations to this property were well done. clean and quaint, the equine theme was carried out well. Getting to my room on the 6th floor, I found that the renovations followed thru to the rooms and it was clean, well maintained and comfortable. Small bathroom with everything I needed and a fairly comfortable sized room with a king bed, sitting table and chairs, flat screen tv, countertop with coffee maker and under counter mini-fridge. The sliding glass doors opened to a little balcony overlooking Ala Moana Blvd and the surrounding hotels. All done well and comfortable.Two things to keep in mind, the bathroom is small, shower was tight but functional, and the street noise can be loud during the day and evenings with the older sliding glass doors to the balcony not keeping much of the sound out.Over all, I had a very nice stay and will be staying again next time I need a little break.

It could do with a bit of a makeover but other than than we experienced no issues. Front desk staff were always friendly & helpful. Our balcony overlooked one side of the hotel and even with the door shut we could hear traffic noise. We had hired a car so its US$25 per day to park.

It's not too bad but depending on what time of day it is can get a bit tedious. Unfortunately your car is not always on hand as they have to park it in a larger car park behind the hotel, so when you are leaving allow time for them to get your car. Big plus is that the hotel is within walking distance of a major shopping centre, the Ala Moana Center.

I have chosen this hotel for a conference held in Hawaii Convention Centre.The one and only advantage of this hotel is its location. It is located in Waikiki island and close to the Hawaii Conference Centre. It is good for those attending conference which is around 10 mins walk from the hotel. The hotel is also close to major shopping area (Ala Moana shopping centre) and Waikiki beach. However, there are several down sides for this hotel:1. No elevator from car drop-off area to hotel lobby, you have to carry your luggage and walk up few flights of stairs. No one is gonna help you to carry your luggage. 2. Hotel room is quite small for American standard. The room sound proof is extremely poor, the hotel is located just next to Ala Moana Blvd, which is the main road of Waikiki. The sound proof of the hotel window or glass door is so poor that you are like sleeping beside the main road. I can never fall asleep at night without an ear plug. I would not stay in this hotel if I realised the noise before I arrived.3. Room has lots of wear and tears, for e.g. the room glass door to balcony is cracked.4. The one and only one lift of this hotel often malfunction, I encountered 4 incidents of lift broke-down during my stay in this hotel.5. Lack of staff in this hotel.

Nothing much has changed from 2 years ago. Rooms are very nice, beds extremely comfortable, and the staff is very friendly and helpful. We borrowed beach towels and chairs every day that we went to the beach. Weather was great. The location of this hotel is really good for us as we love the Harbor Pub across the street and the convenience of the ABC store a few doors down. Lots of restaurants in walking distance. The traffic noise was worse this year, even from the top floor! Motorcycles especially annoying racing down the street in front of the hotel. Not a huge fan of the dressers. Drawers are hard to open and the furniture has a musty smell so I lived out of my suitcase all week. Still, we will return to Equus.

The location is perfect for us being next to Ala Moana, Bowls beach which is a minute walk across the stress to the firework show hosted by Hilton Hawaiian village on Friday nights at 745. Unfortunately, the view from the hotel is blocked from the Hawaii Prince hotel. Some may complain about the street noise but its really not that bad as long as you keep the sliding door closed.

Also, really nice: it's a neat hotel, so no resort fee! I like the horse theme personally, and I like that it's not a hotel where a family would go. It's great for couples, or, at most, one well behaved child who doesn't need outside entertainment. There is a pool tucked away, but no on site restaurant. There is parking, at a price.

Nevertheless, we both kept and open mind, and in the end, we were struck with a lasting impression by the Aloha Spirit from ALL of the employees from the front desk to the valet guys. Below, I have added the email that I had sent to Rene, the Guest Services Manager at the Equus:Rene, Aloha!  Now that my wife and I are back here on the mainland and beginning to readjust and get back into the swing of things, we would like to extend a heart-felt thank you to everyone there at the Equus Hotel for making us feel so welcome and helping us to have the best vacation that we've EVER HAD!!!!  Sure, we've seen some other beautiful states and have done some things that can now be crossed off of our bucket list, but, Hawaii was by the far the best experience.  We definitely miss the people, the weather, the ocean, the mountains, and most of all, the Aloha! We would like to thank you for your consideration to help us with the possibility of receiving some 100% Kona coffee from your friend.  This friendly gesture was extremely thoughtful and nice, and we will be forever grateful for your thought alone, should this end up not panning out, for whatever reason. And, not to leave anyone left out, we would also like to send a well-deserved thank you to the valet guys.  All of them were great, however, Paul (the skinnier of the two) played a huge part in helping to make our vacation great.  He never once misdirected us, and his suggestions and advice were nothing less than excellent.  Paul is a valuable asset for the Equus Hotel as he often went above and beyond.  Before we left for the airport, we were glad to see that he was working, and he was rewarded with a big, grateful hug from my wife and a thankful hand shake from me.  We will never forget him! We just wanted to thank you very much for helping our time on O'ahu to be the best vacation experience on record for us.  You and the Equus Hotel will be held in high regard, as far as we're concerned.  Shaka! Mahalo and Aloha!How 'bout them apples, huh? We can just go on and on about how awesome the Equus staff was.In regards to some of the previous reviews written by others, maybe we might be able to help others make a decision based upon our own experiences while staying at the Equus Hotel:Yes, as others have stated, the entire group of people who make up the Equus staff are nothing short of awesome, accommodating, friendly, and easy to talk to. I would definitely stay here again based on them alone, as well as, highly recommend the Equus to anyone interested in staying in Honolulu.Yes, there are stairs leading up to the front desk; however, there is an elevator available to get to all of the rooms. And, as others have said in their own reviews, we also agree that the beds were very comfortable!Yes, they are currently working on updating the hotel; and although it's not as colorful or extravagant as some of the other hotels right on Waikiki, we found it to be quite comfortable and convenient, and suited our needs very well. Its location was even nice for an evening walk to the ABC Store, a few of the local restaurants in the area, and even to the west end of Waikiki Beach.Yes, it is located right on Ala Moana Blvd., which, does lend to some road noise, but, my wife and I actually felt that the noise was a non-event. The noises really didn't bother us at all.And, since the hotel is right on Ala Moana Blvd., the traffic can become heavy at times depending upon the time of day, which can make it a little challenging to get out into traffic every once in a while. Yet, it isn't much different than trying to get out into traffic in any other large city here on the mainland.In closing, when it comes to getting to the Equus Hotel from the Honolulu International Airport (from the west), you will want to be in the far-left lane on Ala Moana Blvd. When you see the Ala Moana Shopping Center on your left (parking garage on street level), then you're getting close.You will cross the Ala Wai Canal, where you can also see a marina on your right as you're crossing the bridge over the canal.The next traffic light will be Hobron Lane. This is where you will want to get into the left-hand turn lane and cut a (legal) U-turn. (A Red Lobster will be on your right; a Crazy Shirts t-shirt shop will be cattycorner and across the street from the Red Lobster on the right; a McDonald's will be cattycorner to the left; and on the other side of the hedgerow in the median will be an ABC Store - you may not be able to see it, but trust me, it's there.)After making the U-turn, be sure that you're in the right-hand lane, and just a short distance away, on the right, will be the entrance to the Marina Tower Waikiki, which is literally just before you get to the hotel entrance. This is where you will pull your car in for the valet guys, who will take very good care of you. (If they're not there when you get there, they're probably busy parking or retrieving a car for someone else). The parking area is kind of tight quarters, but, the valet guys are helpful.And, on another note, should you require your car during the valet off-hours, all you need to do is make arrangements with them beforehand, and they will make sure that your car is available when you need it.I certainly hope that this helps those who may be undecided in regards to staying at this hotel. Although, I can't speak for everyone else who has stayed there in the past, I can assure you that my wife and I will definitely be returning to the see the people at the Equss Hotel during our return trip to Hawaii . . . whenever that might be.","Bristol, Indiana","AJRobertson52</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, Indiana</strong>",9,5.0

The hotel is a little challenging to access by car, as the driveway is located right on busy Ala Moana and is very narrow. Getting to the hotel requires a stair climb (which the hotel is very clear about when making a reservation).

First and foremost, would I stay here again. Yes, but it would not be my first choice. Because it is an ""Asend Collection"" it gives you the impression of something really impressive, it is not. Average yes, much higher priced average. Although I didn't research it, maybe not so much considering it is in Hawaii. On the good side, the location is great, the people super friendly and accommodating.On the down side, as I see many others have complained about, starting with the entrance, if you are handicapped, this is absolutely not an ADA compliant hotel in my opinion. If I had to get myself or my wife up those steps in a wheelchair, I don't think I could do it. It looks nice, but not easy for ADA people. The parking was by valet only and you really go into the driveway of the neighboring property. We did not go out late at night, but the valet (at a forced $25/night + tip) is not there during late night hours, so beware. The main room is OK in size, the restroom is odd shaped and had a very small shower. If you like baths, we stayed here twice, both rooms only had showers, no tub. Like others, I noticed the water had an unusual smell. Many complained here, and I can't stress it enough, the things that can keep me awake are light and heat. If noise will keep you awake, this is NOT the hotel for you. I kept double checking the sliding door to make sure it was closed, it sounded as if it was open the entire time. The wooden shudders do not do a very good job keeping the light out, but I understand it is the decor. The balcony is great, however view was horrible, and even noisier. We like to people watch so we watched the passing traffic and pedestrians. The second room we were in had the A/C until on the balcony making it even noisier and way to hot to sit out there, very disappointing. The A/C unit did not work very good, they seem to be in disrepair or not strong enough for the room size. Like others we attempted to keep costs down by eating in the room after shopping at the grocery store. We packed the small fridge, and I never did see any ice, when I asked where it was, they brought some up to me instead.We did not use the pool, looked beautiful but rather small, and where situated doubt it gets much sun. What I also noticed, other than the metal rail steps, there appeared to be no regular steps leading into the shallow end of the pool, very unusual to see.Except for the real low end Choice Hotels, most have breakfast, not here. So we bought milk and cereal for breakfast that we ate in the room. Considering the price, this was disappointing.Again, not horrible, but considering the price, it fell short in many areas. We would strongly look elsewhere before staying here again, but we would not rule the place out if it seemed where we wanted to be for location, but with the A/C issues, non-ADA aspects, noise issues, most likely would stay elsewhere.",Murdock,"yourswflnotary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Murdock</strong>",48,3.0

Can't beat the location surrounded by much more expensive hotels charging well over twice the cost of the Equus. Yes you need to carry your luggage up from the street level- but this should be no surprise as it is clearly stated in their web page. From where you check in-there is a lift that will carry you up to your floor. We liked having the fresh water dispenser in the lobby area saved us from purchasing bottled water. The staff are friendly, rooms were cleaned every day with fresh towels, we had no bugs for the 4 nights we stayed. Parking is $25 per day with in and out privileges, valet was always there when we needed him. We were on the 4 th floor you can hear the traffic from the street, but this did not bother us. If you are a light sleeper, and don't like to carry luggage up one flight of stairs you may want to check into one of the high priced hotels close by (The Modern across the street is $450 +).

It's a double flight with no lift - not good with luggage. Next was the overwhelming traffic noise in the room. Ironically, the AC was the quietest we'd encountered in the USA so we couldn't use that to neutralise the traffic noise. We asked for a different room but none were available. As it was Friday night, the noise continued until well after we were trying to get to sleep. This hotel needs to install double glazing.Honolulu is now an expensive place for accommodation so there's no such thing as good value any more. The day we were leaving to the airport was the flower parade along the road outside the hotel and we had difficulty finding out whether the carriageway towards the airport was going to be closed or not. In the end, it turned out that it was staying open. However, Uber, Lyft and the shuttle companies all said they couldn't get to the hotel. The girl on reception was very helpful and managed to call a taxi to take us, although they took a long time to arrive and we actually turned down a couple of passing taxis.","Noosa, Australia","Adrian P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Noosa, Australia</strong>",192,2.0

However, before you can get to your room you have to lug your luggage up a 2 flights of stairs just to get to the lobby!! There is no elevator from the parking lot to the lobby, so that was a bad first impression. Then the valet (which you're forced to pay for the $25/night valet charge because they have no self parking) only has one guy working and he takes FOREVER to just take your car from you. The 4 times that we arrived and left our hotel, there was never anyone waiting for you at the podium. But what really made me rate this hotel poor is that the morning we checked out of our hotel, we went down to the parking lot and our car was parked right in the front where we had parked it OURSELVES the night before - and the door was UNLOCKED!! I parked it there, so I know I locked the door before giving the valet my key. So when I commented to him that my door was unlocked he said, ""Oh, I know...no worry, we were watching it all night"". Which I know was not true because their valet is only open from 6:00am - 10:00pm!!

Prior to booking the hotel, I reviewed not only Trip Advisor, but also another website before booking, so I was a little dismayed that after we became settled, we discovered some creepy crawlies in our room. And let's just say, there were enough of them that made us ask for a change in rooms. If we had been in the second room first, I probably would have rated them as very good instead of average.The rooms and hotel are a little dated. They are currently doing renovations. I am not sure what the renovations are for, but there were signs posted indicating when they would do them, which is helpful and lets me know they are working on making the hotel better. I will say I am not sure if I will return, but I am always willing to give something a second chance, especially once time has lapsed.P.S. As noted above, the service was very good. Puka, one of the hotel staff, was very cordial and was willing to allow an hour late check out for me despite the hotel being sold out the next night. Also, although he asked for someone to take my luggage downstairs, he ended up doing it as the other employee was probably busy.

As a business traveler I stay in chain hotels most of the time but the chain hotels in the Waikiki area are much more expensive so I decided to give this hotel a try because of the much lower room cost difference for my longer trip. The rooms are very comfortable and the furniture in each room is unique, with Hawaian type furniture. I had the city view room (1005) on the 10th floor which was recommended to me due to the noise from the Blvd traffic. There is honestly a lot of noise on Ala Moana so the higher the room the better. There is no morning breakfast other than basic coffee service in the lobby so be prepared to hit the nearby McDonalds or IHOP in the morning. Beach access is just 5 minutes’ walk away. Wifi is good but not super-fast nor reaching outside the room. There is only one elevator and depending on the time of day it may be a few minutes wait. Handicap access is not available and there are steps involved to get checked in or to get into the elevator. During my stay I did have AC in the room suddenly stop for no real good reason. I did call reception and the staff came up at 1130 pm but could not get it working so let me have a small fan and I opened the windows. Another room nearby reported AC problems and even a few days later another guest in the same room also had AC problems. The staff here is always so welcoming each morning and evening and takes great care to meet your needs as best they can. For example one night my room was not made up and when I called reception they immediately sent up staff to freshen up my room. For me, this place is a real good deal for the money. You don’t need to spend 300+ dollars a night in the chain hotels and can cut your hotel stay in half. This hotel is a great value if you have a longer stay and don't mind not having direct beach access and some minor inconveniences line AC, and no breakfast. I would stay here again only for a longer stay.","Tyrone, Georgia","Topdiamond</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tyrone, Georgia</strong>",81,3.0

It is such a gem of a hotel I definitely recommend! It's family owned and operated and you really feel that in the warm hospitality. I love the beautiful pool; it's perfect when you're returning to your room and want to cool off and relax.CARS/WALKINGWe arrived late but the front desk and valet staff were as friendly and helpful as ever, checking us in and parking our car. There's a lot under the hotel, which is really convenient and reasonable for Waikiki. The hotel team valet the car and the price is added to your card when you checkout. A car's not totally necessary at this location if you want to stay in Waikiki, since you can walk everywhere from this location: Ala Moana Mall and Park, to Duke's in the heart of Waikiki. ROOMWe arrived in our room and gifts and a hand-written note were waiting, which my friend's boyfriend coordinated with the hotel for my friend's birthday. It was extremely thoughtful. Even without the added surprise of the gift, the room was clean and the perfect blend of modern (white sheets, flat screen TV, new mini fridge/freezer, marble counters, rain shower, etc.) and charming (Hawaii Polo Club pictures, white shutters on the windows, which open for fresh air!). We felt so relaxed. The room had two beds, super comfortable, and was really spacious. We filled the fridge with snacks from the nearby ABC store which is open late if not open 24 hours. We called it ""our"" ABC store, since we went there all the time. They have everything.SERVICEWe enjoyed the text message concierge service as well as the normal route of calling the front desk for things we needed, like a corkscrew. We borrowed beach towels from the hotel and enjoyed the plentiful water, coffee and snacks in the open air lobby. I definitely recommend taking advantage of the hotel's affiliation with the Hawaii Polo Club, it's an unforgettable experience on a part of the island you might not normally see. Also, the hotel has a desk outside their lobby, near the pool, completely devoted to helping you plan trips and activities around the island.

They do NOT have their own parking, but use an outside valet service. We were there for four nights, which means parking alone added $100 to our total. This is ridiculous, and actually $5 more per day than the much more posh but not much more expensive, nearby Ala Moana Hotel. 2) Most people going to Waikiki aren't worried about working, but for those who are, be advised that at least our two double-bed room had no desk. 3) No view, at least from our room.

Also, there is only one very old and slow elevator to get to the rooms. Our first key card didn't work so we had to go back down to reception to get another.The room was quite big, clean and modern although the wardrobe being in the bathroom area was a bit weird bit not a big issue.

They responded promptly and fix the problem so, again, it wasn't a major problem, just an annoyance.The balcony was quite small but did have views over Ala Moana Boulevard to the sea (sort of) but the glass sliding door and windows facing the street were old and thin and did not block out any road noise. As we had to be up at 4am we really wanted to get some sleep but it was hard to sleep with the road noise which was like sleeping on the median strip.Overall the hotel was ok and served the purpose we needed but I could not imagine staying here for an entire holiday as the road noise would drive me insane.","Melbourne, Australia","Tygaman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",220,3.0

But Rene was so fresh and helpful and amazing. She was so pleasant and had a room ready early and also recommended the most amazing breakfast spot that we went to right away. She had them help us with our bags and they valeted too! Even brought the bags up to our rooms and then kumaka brought us the most amazing beautiful juicy pineapple it looked like art!!!! And while we were waiting in the lobby kumaka also brought us juice!!! It was so wonderful he was so so so courteous!!! And they both really made sure to go above and beyond. When we inquired about staying at another hotel at a later date rene even went and called around to her friends to find us a hotel and a good deal!!! On her own time i couldn't believe it. She really helped with us when she could've just brushed us off. Pretty amazing definitely don't get this service at the big brand hotels who are too busy to care. Also they have beautiful furniture and the place is spotless! Very clean and updated! They even have keurigs!!!! And creamer and muffins in the lobby. Awesome walking location. The hotel was nice but Rene kumaka and all the other gang was what really stood out and what will continue to make this hotel stand out. Thanks so so so much!!!!!

When they did the makeover the developers should have spent some extra money on a couple of things they completely overlooked or couldn't stretch the money far enough. 1) One thing they overlooked was the large aluminium framed glass sliding doors on the balcony. They are HUGE and the runners are worn out. The locking mechanism likewise. My wife accidentally locked herself out on the balcony and luckily I was there to let her back in. Then, a few days later, the same thing happened to me. But the REALLY bad thing about these old doors and windows is that they let in an unacceptably massive amount of road/traffic noise from Ala-Moana Boulevarde just below. The noise is so loud that it disrupts sleep (if you can get to sleep in the first place) and if you're not trying to sleep, forces you to turn up the TV volume.2) The other thing they overlooked was that from the street to the lobby, there is a flight of narrow-ish steps. Just perfect for carrying you're luggage up and down.3) On arrival we found some small (about 5mm long) grubs wriggling around inside 2 paper napkins on the counter. We dealt with them easily but they shouldn't have been there in the first place.4) The room was made up each day, but for some reason the toilet paper wasn't replaced, so I had to visit reception to get some.5) We could easily hear the people upstairs who made a lot of noise when walking around their room.6) The hot water took about 2 to 4 minutes to get to our room (902) meaning that all that cold water was a waste.7) The plumbing is so bad that you could hear when the neighbouring rooms flushed their toilets.8) Why on earth would the only wardrobe in the room be placed inside the bathroom? When I wanted to dress I couldn't, because I'd be interrupting my wife's privacy.....and Visa Versa. In its favour the hotel is ideally placed should you want to do some shopping in the Ala-Moana shopping center. Just an 8 minute walk gets you to the lower level food court for breakfast.Regarding the Cliches.... ""Never judge a book by its cover""......The hotel's website makes the place look really classy. But its not. Its average. I'd be giving it 3 green dots if it wasn't for the noise and poor sleep quality.""You get what you pay for"".....The price is very reasonable compared to other hotels in the area. But having stayed in some of those ""other"" hotels, I wont be going back to this one.","Moruya, Australia","TheMoruya2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Moruya, Australia</strong>",155,2.0

Ala Moana mall (the big shopping precinct) was a 5 minute walk down the road and in the opposite direction was the rest of central Waikiki.The best part by far was the fact it was my birthday while we were there. When we returned to our room that night the staff had made a personalised birthday card for me and all of them had signed it - along with that were two shell lei's, a beautifully carved pineapple, chocolates and a bottle of red wine.

I would recommend this hotel for anyone not looking to stay in the middle of Waikiki but still be close enough to experience downtown Honolulu. We walked to Waikiki (about 1.5 miles or 20 minutes) several times. We also drove to Diamond Head and Pearl Harbor (both about 15-20 minutes). It's also only 20 minutes from the Airport. There are plenty of restaurants and stores within walking distance as well (some only a block down the street). I would stay here again on my next visit without even looking elsewhere, we had a great stay. One thing to note (and possibly the only downside) is that the pool doesn't get much sun and was fairly chilly. I didn't see it get much use during our stay, but with Waikiki less than 20 minutes away, why go in the pool? We stayed on a lower floor and were not bothered by street noise, but are also not super light sleepers.

Since it was for just one night, we didn't do as much research as we did for the resorts on the other islands we visited. Shame on me, I read their ""boutique"" hotel description and immediately thought that they would be in the same class as a Kimpton...I was wrong.  The Equus started off badly from the moment my husband and I stepped out of the cab. We weren't sure where to enter the building, we walked towards the front and saw only two slights of stairs with no doorman or bellman, so we walked along by the parking lot to see if we missed a ramp or an elevator. In doing so, we walked directly past a valet three times who never looked up to offer guidance or help. When we finally approached him, he informed us that there was no other way in and we had to take the stairs. He only got up to help after my husband requested help getting our 3 suitcases plus our carry on luggage up to the lobby. When we arrived in the lobby, the gentleman at the check in desk was polite, and noticed that we were very unhappy with our arrival experience. He apologized for us being upset, but again offered no assistance. When we got into the elevator we rode up with another couple who also noticed we were disappointed, and they told us that we were lucky because they are on the 9th floor and for the first four nights of their stay the only elevator in the hotel was out of order!The room was small, which was OK and they did have a boat made out of fresh pineapple on the counter for us as a welcome/happy honeymoon gift. The street noise was quite loud and very noticeable in the room even with the balcony door and curtains closed. The shower was extremely tiny, probably the smallest shower I have ever seen in a hotel. The bed was comfortable, and the TV was a flatscreen in good condition.

We will NEVER stay in this hotel again. Their service is very slow, even check-in took almost thirty minutes because the guy managing the front desk went off to attend to someone's bags (and this was around 11 pm at night when we were already supremely exhausted), and at first we thought it was just the pace of the island lifestyle. But then, during our week long stay, our room was not cleaned for three days-- and not because of their ""eco friendly"" policy. It turned out that it wasn't just the pace, it was very much a lack of proper service. Our dirty mugs and glasses were not cleaned or replaced, the bed was not made, and the towels weren't replaced. When we complained, it took the person in charge four trips to bring fresh cups and glasses and clear the waste basket. He was nice enough, but did tell us that he was not the one that was working in the morning when the room should have been cleaned so he had no explanations to offer. The next day, when the same thing happened again and I called the front desk, I was told that I had to go downstairs to get fresh mugs because no one was available to bring them up. They were nice about it, but whats the point if you don't do the bare minimum? On other things-- the shower is tiny, and I mean Manhattan tiny. The room costs as much too! There is no microwave, so don't plan a long stay! The AC didn't work the night we checked in so they gave us a fan instead of a room change. We woke up sweating in the Hawaii heat-- they fixed it the next day however, and it worked fine for the rest of the trip. The bed is not very comfortable either-- so not a good place to sleep off a long day at the beach. The shower had hair on the wall left behind by the previous guests that had not been cleaned. I cleaned it before we showered because it was already 1 am by the time we got a fan to replace the broken AC.... and that's how our stay began, sure taught us a thing or two about picking places to stay in Honolulu next time.I won't recommend this hotel to anyone. There are many nicer options for the same price in Waikiki, choose those. Or even better, go out to the North Shore!","New York City, New York","AlePad2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",38,1.0

This hotel was chosen because of location and price. However, it is very hard to see as well as drive to from the west because of the high divider separating the east and west traffic. We actually had to turn right and find a place to turn around so we could access the hotel. The hotel sign was small and the valet parking was not very well marked. There is no elevator from the parking area to the registration desk. The only way to get to the registration desk was to climb a flight of stairs which is hard to do when you have large suitcases for a cruise. The lobby is not air conditioned. The staff was very helpful in telling us where to eat and answering other questions that we had. The room was comfortable and a card had already been placed in the light switch so we did not have to use our key card to turn on the lights. The carpet was old and dirty and needed to be replaced. Air conditioning was good, but was tricky to adjust using a remote. The elevator was extremely slow. The Wifi was the one of the best hotel Wifi's that we have used.

No drink has ever been as good as that one was after traveling.The room was nice; perhaps a little dark, but it was clean and had everything we needed. After dropping off our luggage, we went outside again for another drink and took time to relax in the Hawaiian sunshine.The staff recommended the Chart House for dinner. It was just a short walk from the hotel, and we got to enjoy a fabulous sunset while eating an excellent meal. We sort of couldn't believe everything was real after starting our day in Ohio!The bed was comfortable, and the in-room coffee was nice. The next morning, we walked down the road to a cool retro coffee shop for breakfast. We were departing on a cruise, and the Equus graciously allowed us to store our stuff there after check-out time.Overall, we were impressed and would stay there again.","Columbus, Ohio","beccaruda</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",19,5.0

It is a motel style sort of place – you enter the rooms from a stairwell that is on the outside. The rooms are small but have character, particularly the bathroom which had a very nice layout compared to the standard business type hotels. There is no bath, only a shower. The free internet worked very well. There is parking downstairs but it appeared to be valet parking at a price. There is also a bus stop just one minute’s walk away which has an array of buses that can take you to the main sights including Pearl Harbour and the airport. Buses cost a flat $2.50 so if you have hand luggage only you can use this from the airport. However, the buses do not take anything more than hand baggage so if you have something large and no car then you will need to take a cab or the super shuttle. The staff were exceedingly friendly and helpful.There are some major negatives to this place. Firstly, the constant noise from the main road just wasn’t blocked out to any extent by my windows (which looked single glazed) so there was continuous noise all day (Honolulu does seem to be an early to bed early to rise sort of place). Secondly, my room had no curtains. Instead, it had a set of louvre doors that I had to slide along to block out the light. Unfortunately, the light simply shone through the louvre slits so the only way I could sleep was to wear a Lone Ranger style mask given to me on the plane to block out the light. Also, although the room was characterfully decorated with a wicker four poster bed, I kept banging my head on the overhanging frame.When compared to all the other hotels in the area, with their fancy foyers etc., this is clearly a budget option at a budget price so I wouldn’t see it as a bargain – you pay less but get less (having said that, I still paid more for this hotel than any other on my trip but I think that is the way Hawaii works). The room size is ideal for one person but two people (particularly if they are of largish size) might find it a little cramped. And yes, the lift does take forever.","London, United Kingdom","FrequentFlyerMan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",32,3.0

I love the bed and pillows; the room is spacious enough, and the decor is fine and fits the boutique style. The pineapple they brought me was tasty as a welcome gift. I'm not sure if that was a welcome gift because of my Diamond status here or if it was a welcome gift for everyone. The air conditioner was quiet and while there was road noise, it wasn't unbearable. Onto the cons. I'll skip over the inherent issues such as location as that's something to be factored in when booking. Valet: only one person works there and they're never there. I parked my car every time myself. Why pay $25 for mandatory valet if a 10 minute wait isn't enough for valet to come park the car?Booking: I booked a room online using my Choice points. I chose a ""top floor, superior room, larger room"" the room I was given originally wasn't top floor and apparently all rooms here are actually the exact same size. So to start off, the booking choices is based on rooms that don't exist. Security: I came in around 8pm after a roadtrip around the island, parked my car myself again, and then went to the front desk to ask for a second key as the one they gave me didn't work for my room. Without hesitation and without asking for any proof of ID, I was given a second card! Great, anyone could have come into my room. Room: There are only 2 accessible outlets in the room, both by the coffee machine. The bathroom fan cannot be turned off. Service: I had gone downstairs to get a couple packs of single serve coffee and the staff mentioned that they had ""no more stock for the night"". Whatever that means.Building: Not accessible for wheelchairs as the lobby only has stair access. The elevator button lights also don't work so you'll never know if you called the elevator or if it's broken. To sum up: The Ascend Collection is not upscale. Security alone is a reason I'd never come back. I'm greatly disappointed with this hotel as I've had wonderful stays with Choice Hotels in the past (as per the diamond status).",Canada,"599lklol</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",17,1.0

In fact generally speaking public transport is a great option for Honolulu and can get you to major sites like Pearl Harbour and Hainama Bay for a flat fee of 2.50.","Melbourne, Australia","peter18152013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",26,4.0

But I must say, I was very impressed with the whole establishment! The staff could not have been more helpful or delightful. The room was clean and comfortable with loads of cupboards (sideboards) that we were able to store our piles and piles of shopping in! We had a room on the 9th floor at the street end and could see glimpses of the ocean from our window and from the balcony outside our room. We weren't really bothered by the street noise. The air conditioning was good. Before we arrived I was a bit concerned about our luggage with those front stairs but our Hawaii23 driver carried our bags up and down for us. There is only one lift, but we rarely waited more than a few minutes and it was very often at the lobby waiting when we arrived. The location was a nice easy walk to the Ala Moana Centre, Walmart and a Ross store. All the tours/shuttles we used (e.g. to Pearl Harbor, Outlets, Circle Island Tour, Luau etc) picked us up from Ilikai which is a 5 minute walk across the road and McDonalds and an ABC Store are about 3 minutes walk. Buses and trolleys to take you into the middle of Waikiki also leave from the Ilikai. One night we caught a cab from the middle of Waikiki back to Equus and it cost around $10. Overall we are glad we chose the Equus and would gladly stay there again.

What a refreshing surprise. I've read the reviews before I chose to book, and people complained about the smallness of the rooms and bathroom. Yes, it was small, but it was cozy, comfortable and affordable. When we arrived, the valet guy helped us immediately, within 3 minutes the bellboy was there to fetch our suitcases and snorkel gear. Up the stairs we go to a speedy check-in. I've read people complain about the few stairs they had to climb, but seriously if it bothered you that bad, I'm sure the friendliness and efficiency of the staff makes up for any stairs you had to climb. We were on the 7th floor, Rm 307, saw a bit of the harbor view from the front door. The room was clean, and cool. After unpacking a few things we headed to the lobby for a complimentary Mai Tai at 5pm, that's where we met Chad, who was very helpful and knowledgeable of the local restaurants, clubs, pubs and other sites.It's in walking distance to the harbor & even Ala Moana Center. Red Lobster & Outback is opposite the hotel, as well as Chart House, which faces the harbor. We had breakfast at Ilikai's Cinnamon restaurant, also in walking distance. If you don't feel like walking, there are numerous busses, cabs and Uber. Also my fave store was located on the corner. Who does not like to shop at the ABC store.

The noise from the street never stopped, and the room had no AC fan to turn on to counter the ceaseless racket that included loud car engines, construction noise, sirens, and even booming fireworks.The hotel is also inconvenient in that guests have to climb quite a number of stairs just to get to the front desk, and that's after being forced to submit to valet parking (at $25 per day plus tip). We had to unload all of our luggage and get help from a bellhop (another tip) to lug it all up the stairs. There was no luggage cart available, and even if there were, the stairs wouldn't allow its use.We had a refrigerator, which would have been great for reducing the cost of overpriced food in the area, but since there was no microwave oven, that hope was dashed.Also, the Internet connection was slow most of the time and cut off completely at times.In addition, the room was too warm, and although there was AC, there was no way to control the temperature.I will not visit this establishment again.

Loud noise of scraping furniture in room above most of the afternoon and from 2am onwards loud enough to wake you up.

I traveled to Oahu for business and I booked this hotel because it was all I could find at the last minute. It is in an okay location. I was able to walk to the beach and most shopping, but it is still a bit of a walk. I ended up with the queen bamboo room, and I would not recommend this room. The room was extremely small, and the bamboo furniture was uncomfortably large for the tiny room. The mattress was terrible and sloped toward the center. The shower was so tiny I have a hard time imagining a large or even a normal sized person using it (I am quite petite and still had difficulty). The air conditioner was sad and did not cool very well and it was extremely loud. The staff was friendly overall, but I had numerous occasions where I could not find anyone to help me. I had to attend early morning meetings and because they make you valet park, you do not have easy access to your car. Despite making arrangements each time the night before – and the front desk person promised me they would be there – I found myself standing by the front desk for 15 to 20 minutes yelling for someone and knocking on various doors to try and find someone to help. This was at roughly 6:30 in the morning. One other thing that was horrible was the steps you have to walk up to get to the hotel itself. It rains often in Hawaii and these steps become wet. I slipped and took a hard fall onto the sidewalk while trying to carry my suitcase down.

As I checked it I was amazed at that golden stairs as you make your way up to the reservation desk. As soon as I reached the desk I was greeted by someone with this fabulous cold drink which was well needed after coming from the airport. The check in process was fast and easy. I was in room 501 the corner unit which was great. As I entered the room it was very cozy and nice with a cold air condition unit which I was SUPER happy about. I can't sleep with out air condition so it all worked well. I had made a call to the front desk to wake me up at 4am the next morning to get up for the marathon. As requested I got a wake up call at 4am. The best part through my whole stay at the Equus was after I was done with the marathon I came back to the hotel totally beat and tired. The housekeeper was very concerned and asked if I needed any help to my room, I thought for a split second how is he going to help me???? carry me???? That would have been nice. But just to show the generosity and nice gestures the employees are at Equus. As I was checking out they helped me take my baggage downstairs and walked me to my cab.

You are a 2 minute bike ride or bus Ride or UBER from Downtown Waikiki and a short walk to the big Mall and Restaurants and State Park Beach. I myself, like staying at the Marina Towers, but my first 4 years were in the Hotel and the service is probably better and more controlled there. Let's start with Ownership and management. Mike, the owner is a great guy, with Integrity and he is ex UCLA Alumni, enough said.LOL. His GM, Mariah, also part of Ownership, is a sweet Gem, and is humble and not afraid to take control and get her hands dirty/wet and put in some work. When I arrived last year, a few hours early, and the Bell Boy was at Lunch, this lady, got it in gear, Grabbed my 40 pound suitcases herself, and brought them next door for me. I will never forget that visual, LOL, as usually upper management delegates these duties, but not in this one case. Also, Mariah, is a fair lady, and within reason, she will listen to your concerns. Lucky to have her there, captain the ship. Jackie of Housekeeping, is a great team player and very accommodating and on the ball. Kika operations Manager is also very nice and let me print my boarding pass in the office when I was leaving back to Santa Monica. Rene Kahumoku, is an incredible member of the team, and is the guest Services Manager. She has been there all 8 years I have stayed there, and whether I need Wake Up Calls, Restaurant Advice, Island Sightseeing advice, Room Add on or upgrades, she is your go to Michael Jordan in the clutch. She is gracious, patient, kind and very sharp. No vacation, would be complete without a good Housekeeping staff and Handyman. Junex is great and there is nothing he cannot fix or respond to in a proactive manner.

We spent 2 full days and one night on Oahu.Location: The Equus is located in Waikiki, about 10 min drive from downtown. We went out in Chinatown the night we were there and had a quick Uber ride back to the comfort of the Equus after a great meal at the Pig and the Lady.Room: We stayed in a suite on the top floor. The room was very spacious and furnished with Chinese antiques that fit in the general equestrian motif. The couch and bed were very comfortable, the shower was nice and big and the furnishings were unique and interesting. Staff: It is clear that the staff know their business and their city. Everything was painless and easy and we were greeted with a smile and an ahola at every interaction.

Where we found a welcome note and congratulations and a little treat of bubbly and chocolate (we let them know it was our anniversary in advance). It really made the arrival feel special and we immediately felt at home.The next day everyone we encountered was super friendly, and obliging without being overbearing. The GM was in the lobby when we checked out and she took the time to have a chat about our plans for the day, and ask us about our stay. She was very genuine and sweet, and offered us tips for the day (go check out the Manoa falls!).Facilities:We had one of the suites on the top floor and it was just perfect. Big enough to feel like a real 'home' (seriously, the size of our entire NYC apartment if not bigger), but not so overly large that you feel adrift as some big name hotels seem to think their suites have to be... The kitchenette had everything we could have needed for a comfortable and self sufficient long stay, it was a shame we didn't stay longer to take advantage of it.The bed was sooooo comfy, and huge! My husband and I both had the best night's sleep of our entire trip to Hawaii, over 2 islands and several resorts. The furniture is an eclectic mix of timeless pieces, with so many unique touches, little statues, original artwork, and cozy throws. The 'Equine' theme is definitely noticeable, with horse artwork, and polo magazines around the place, but like everything else in this hotel it doesn't feel overbearing. A bit like an exclusive but friendly polo club I guess! I don't ride, and don't have much interest in horses and I still loved the theme.The bathroom amenities are all a gorgeous local eco friendly brand - not 'hippie' eco friendly - they actually work! and included both shampoo AND conditioner, which I always appreciate.There is tea and coffee in the rooms and free tea, coffee, water, (and amazing mini cookies...), available in the lobby, which feels more like someone's living room than a hotel lobby.

I thought one nice touch is that you can text the front desk with questions about the room, local restaurants, beaches etc. The Room: I had booked an ""upper floor"" but was given 3rd floor. When I asked to change rooms, they switched me right away. Definitely request an upper floor if you can. You'll have more light and it's further from the street noise. There's a mini fridge and wet bar sink in the room, as well as a desk and a flat screen TV on the wall. Free wifi. Some rooms have balconies, some do not. The ones without are bigger. Just personal preference if you want to trade some interior space to have a balcony. I liked having a bigger more spacious room. I didn't need the balcony. Bathroom: The bathroom had a shower (no tub). The lighting in the bathroom was really bad, but as a guy I didn't care. I imagine women trying to put on makeup would not be pleased. Elevator: There's just one and it's pretty slow. Also, it does not go to the street level, so if you have heavy bags you'll have to lug them up one flight of stairs. For this reason, I wouldn't recommend for elderly or anyone who has problems with getting up or down stairs. Location: It's in a good spot. There's an ABC store on the corner which is a great convenience, and as previously stated the mall and the beach are just a block and a half away. If you are wanting to be right on the beach or have a great view, this is not the place. Parking: There is valet parking available for $25/day. For the money, it's a pretty great option. Keep your luxury expectations in check and you'll probably enjoy this place.","Los Angeles, California","AndyCali74</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",176,4.0

We're from the Big Island of Hawai'i and visit O'ahu at least twice a year and always look forward to returning to our 'Ohana at Equus. From our first experience with Equus til our most recent, they've always managed to uphold that welcoming aloha spirit centered upon a family atmosphere. The staff are always friendly and accommodating. At check-in we're always greeted by a positive and engaging staff member, talking story with us and making us feel comfortable during the check-in process. The rooms are nice and clean and budget friendly too.  I'd like to extend my deepest gratitude and appreciation to the hotel staff and management for going above and beyond. About 2 years ago my grandpa had surgery in O'ahu. His recovery wasn't going so well and we were scrambling for accommodations. That's when Equus stepped in and assured us that they would do whatever they could to help our family and accommodate us. We didn't know how long my grandpa's recovery would be so we were on a week to week notice with Equus. They told us not to worry and assured us we'd have a place to stay. In total, I've stayed their for 1 month and it was incredible to see the amount of love and support given to us by everyone at the Equus hotel. When heading out and passing the front desk, the staff would always ask how my grandpa was doing and at times would give us food or snacks.The Equus hotel is the best hotel experience I've had in O'ahu and I can't wait to return and stay with them again!","Hilo, Hawaii","Jacob B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hilo, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

There is a $25 per day parking fee (to be expected in a dense urban area), but the young men working as valets were so charming I didn't really mind. The room was clean and comfy, and I especially liked the Keurig coffee maker and little Hawaiian candies left for us. We were on the 7th floor in a corner, and although there was no noise from other hotel guests, you can't avoid the traffic noise from Ala Moana Blvd. below. This is a VERY busy street/highway, and you will hear the traffic at all hours.

We were just a block from the beach and there were restaurants within walking distance, as well as a convenience store down to block.As others have mentioned, there are stairs to the check-in level. However, they were very helpful and brought all our bags up, so it wasn't a problem at all. One of our group had recently had a hip replaced and did very well.Your room key has to be in the slot on the wall by the entryway for the air conditioner to come on. There is a remote control device to set the temperature. Since we were breaking heat and humidity records, we sometimes left one key in the room to keep the air conditioner running.The other couple in our group had a nice balcony and view. We had a big air return device on our deck and it was loud and very hot. It made the balcony unusable. I would ask for a room without this device on the balcony.One other complaint is we asked for adjoining rooms when we made the reservations in January and then called and asked prior to leaving for Hawaii (in August) and we were put on separate floors. They do not have any ice machines. You can make ice and put it in your in-room refrigerator/freezer. We could only find 7 lb bags at the ABC store and that wouldn't fit in the small freezer. The man at the desk did give me a small baggie with ice in it that he had in his freezer, but you can't count on that.The staff was very friendly and did their best, so I have no complaints there.Again, it was a value considering the location and we were only there for 3 nights.","Plymouth, MN","Cindy0607</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plymouth, MN</strong>",42,4.0

The rooms were clean. Price was right for a hotel in Waikiki (albeit by about 200 feet). It's at the very edge of Waikiki, and although there are places to grab something to eat, the main drag of what you'd want to see in Waikiki are about a 20-30 minute walk. So the location is just alright, but nothing stellar unless you want to eat at the same chain restaurants you can eat at on the mainland.There isn't even so much as a continental breakfast here which was somewhat frustrating as a business traveller looking for a quick bite to grab on my way out in the morning.Parking is limited, so you have to pay $25 (August 2015) per day for valet parking. I wouldn't mind that had I had better than a 50% success rate in a valet attendant being present. The times in the afternoon/evening I ended up just parking the car myself and having to drop the key at the front desk. The times in the morning was inconvenient having to wait for the attendant to come off break (at 7:30 AM as no one was sitting there waiting for their car).It's economical and clean, but I've definitely stayed in more satisfactory places at similar price points.","Eau Claire, Wisconsin","455drewd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eau Claire, Wisconsin</strong>",20,3.0

We were greeted by staff members Erik and Glenn. They were kind enough to open our doors as we exited our rental. They noticed we had small kids traveling with us and had quite a bit of luggage. Glenn then took the initiative to take a cart with our belongings to our room for us. We were again greeted in the lobby by Glenn with a tray filled with glasses of ice cold guava juice as we checked in. Our vacation was off to a great start. Our room was a cool refreshing break from the warm summer heat as it was kept at comfortable temperature. The kids were excited as they began staking claim to which bed was theirs. As an added bonus, our room was equipped with wifi so the kids were able to easily connect and watch their online videos. Not to mention, the wifi would greatly reduce our data usage on our phones during our stay. The room was well stocked and very clean. We immediately made use of the mini fridge to chill water and beverages to use for our daily outings. There was no ice machine onsite, but a quick call to front desk and they delivered two bags of ice to our room. A safe was also conveniently located in the closet to keep our valuables safe while we were out. Being so close to the beach, we never had the opportunity to use their pool. Duke's Lagoon was just across the street and Ala Moana park is just to the right of it. Upon our return from our daily trips, we quenched our thirst with the fruit infused ice water offered in the lobby. There is even a computer workstation to use. A staff member was also readily available outside the lobby to answer any questions or assist you in planning your activities.If we got got hungry, there were a number of restaurants across the street or just a block away. If we wanted to go shopping, we could walk to the Ala Moana Center (shopping mall) just a couple blocks away. There's even an ABC store on the corner to stock up on last minute gifts and snacks. Their ideal location was even more evident on the Fourth of July as the main street was blocked off and the local park hosted the island's largest firework display. We didn't have to fight any traffic and the kids could play in the sand while we watched the fireworks. All just a short walk across the street. On the last day of our stay I met Rene, the manager whom graciously assisted with us with a minor travel dilemma without hesitation.

We arrived at approximately 5:00 and free mai tais were being serve outside the reception area-a nice welcome. The hotel site is quite narrow with the majority of space taken by hotel rooms so the sitting area leading to the pool and lounge area beyond is quite narrow. Check in went smoothly and staff was friendly and helpful. There is only one elevator which is quite slow, benches are thoughtfully provided on each floor.

Coffee provided for a fee ($2.75) though the tap water was foul tasting. Although we were located on a higher floor the proximity to the main road into Waikiki made the room continually noisy, pillows were flat, toilet was loud, and air conditioning was also loud though it did cool off the room.

Easy walk to shopping at Ala Moana, or to the beach and a short trolley/bus ride to the main Waikiki beach.No restaurant or bar but good food options close by (e.g. Red Lobster right across the street) and the new Waikiki micro-brewery is a few minutes walk away. Room was a decent size with a king size bed, All very clean and comfortable. The decent size TV, fridge and Keurig coffee maker covered our needs. Almost silent air-conditioning and a decent temperature shower. Be aware the aircon and some lights will only work when your key card is in the wall - this is deliberate, of course, to save power when you leave the room - I prefer hotels with this sort of green policy.The real selling point of this hotel is that it prides itself on friendliness, the front desk wish you good morning every day, and welcome you back every evening. The maid is friendly and even the guy at the car valet came over to chat and share his passion for customised motorbikes while we waited for our airport shuttle. Combine that with its really great value rates - I suspect far, far cheaper than the Ililakai almost directly opposite, and this makes a great base to explore Waikiki, Honolulu and Oahu itself (for example, the Pearl Harbour bus stops just a couple of minutes walk away).Wifi was particularly good in the room but lots of access points across the hotel all with the same password so our phones always connected to the strongest. Negatives - well as folk have mentioned there are steps up from the street but there was always someone on hand top carry our bags, so no problem. Slow lift - yes, it was slow and sometimes we might have had to wait probably as much as 3 minutes - no big deal. We had a small lanai (patio) but views weren't spectacular but then again you are definitely not paying the price of panoramic ocean views!If we ever get the opportunity to go back to Honolulu then we'd have no hesitation in booking the Equus again.","Southampton, United Kingdom","iambrian2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southampton, United Kingdom</strong>",4,5.0

Normally I'd complain about valet parking, but with such limited spots it actually makes sense. I suggested to the manager, however, they have some type of sign up if the valet needs to step away for whatever reason - otherwise you may find yourself waiting and getting annoyed.Staff at this hotel has always been very good - they have some tenure there, so its not just some high school kid working part time. One even recognized me from 3 years ago (and I should disclose one of their staff worked for me 6 years ago and I trained her - the fact she works here part time is only mere coincidence). The rooms have been redone since the Polo days - very VERY comfortable beds, new countertops in the bathrooms and kitchenette area (coffee maker/fridge), and it appears each room has its own wifi router now. The bathrooms have been redesigned as best as you can for a classic Hawai'i hotel - I can't complain, they make it work... just wish I had a larger shower.Getting in and out of Equus is quite easy - especially when you come to Honolulu for work and NOT vacation. I somehow made it to our office at the airport in less than 17 minutes one day, and I didn't run anyone over or run red lights! The closeness to the marina & Ala Moana Mall is very appealing.So if you are coming to Honolulu for business, I strongly recommend the Equus so you don't have to deal with all the tourists on Kalakaua or Kuhio. I've stayed at the Wyland/Courtyard as well and that adds 20 minutes to my commute! The hotel will deliver exactly what it promises, and its remarkably underpriced for the value. If you are a tourist - easy in and easy out. Its not on the beach, but neither are 80% of the rooms in Waiks. Restaurants are close, and you'll learn a lot about Hawai'i's history on the walls - courtesy of the Bishop Museum.

I offered to show him the proof thru my bank and at that point he printed off my account and saw the billing errors. He assured me he would get it taken care of. I spoke to a manager Rene when I was ready to check out as nothing had been done for me. She said ""we would never do this"". Again I had to prove what I was saying. She said she would take care of this ASAP. I checked my bank again the next day and nothing done. Called in and asked to speak to Rene and was informed she was on her days off. I then spoke with the GM Mariah. She also said ""this never happens"". I had her pull up my file so she could see it for herself. She stated she would contact Rene at home, find out had done and get back with me. Mariah called back and said she would contact the credit card company but that it usually takes 3 to 5 business days to correct. Meanwhile here I am trying to move into a permanent place with all my money tied up in hotel,expenses. I asked for and received $40 so I could had up my rental car in order to return it. Four days after my contact with Poki my card was credited with 2 of the 4 charges. I called and asked why they had reversed only 2 and was told they at least wanted to give us something. Still waiting for all my refunds. Now about the housekeeping staff; comfy bed and clean towels, however the mugs that we used to fix tea in were cleaned out by rinsing them out in the bathroom sink and then drying them with a room towel. Ever heard of a dishwasher that sanitizes your dishes? The noise from the street was horrendous. The seals for the sliding glass door and the room entry door were nonexistint. There was a 1"" gap around the room entry door and the sliding glass door tracks were damaged and could not close properly. Their wifi and TV reception was lbad. When trying to download docs what should have taken minutes took hours. The tv was broken more than it was on. Each time I shut it off it would not turn back on. I called for repairs and they would jiggle the cable wires till it came back on. Ended up leaving it on. The valets parked my car under a tree or overhang and it got covered with bird excrement.

But it is also being at the beginning of Waikiki, just a hop skip and a jump to so many places. Their is dining, fine dining, convenient ABC store, coffee shops, the Ala Moana Beach park for running and Ala Moana Shopping Center for shopping. It is close drive or cab to Downtown Honolulu for work or into the heart of Waikiki for fun and pleasure. Yummy MaiTai' s on Friday is a plus. Lots of reasons to stay. The only draw back is the one elevator, but there is a stairwell for those willing to get some exercise.","Honolulu, Hawaii","DMarzan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",6,3.0

We had the honor of staying two nights at the Equus and Marina Tower in preparation for our participation in the Event. From the point of arrival meeting the Valet Team, to check in, housekeeping services, engineering and continuing throughout our stay, the staff was warm and welcoming, quick to respond to any inquiries we had, and very much interested in what we were going to doing during our visit. Having one room with a kitchen in the Marina Tower was very helpful in feeding our many volunteers and riders. We received a set of connecting rooms on the ground floor of the Equus which was helpful in getting our team organized without having to jump into any elevators. They accommodated our vehicles in one organized location which allowed us the ability to move freely as we needed to be able to leave the property if need be to gather supplies. The staff in all areas were preshifted about us before we arrived and were well prepared for our visit. All introduced themselves to us as they encountered us individually during our stay. Overall, they seem very happy to work there and it shows in the time they take to write personal welcome notes to all arrivals. We respected the fact that they are also energy efficient and was very impressed by the care they took in ensuring guests were well informed of how those features worked in the room. All in all, we were hosted with an enormous amount of Aloha, freely given by all team members we were fortunate enough to meet. The rooms are neat, clean and very beautifully decorated in the equestrian theme and the warm and welcoming staff made our stay quite comfortable. It was like being with friends and family and we are very much looking forward to visiting them again soon. We look forward to a continued partnership with Equus and our weekend event couldn't have gone any better! Mahalo Team Equus for a Fabulous Stay!

All of the staff were very accommodating, especially Jason and Queenie. Our room was on the top floor with a small view of the ocean between buildings! Only complaint was the noisy traffic, although it didn't disrupt our sleep. Another downside was the tiny pool, which I never saw anyone swim in. The bed and pillows were great, the room was spacious and clean, with a refrigerator and coffee maker, sitting area, and good water pressure in the shower. The one elevator was sometimes a little slow, but no problem, and whenever we wanted ice or extra coffee, we were taken care of. There are free Mai Tai's on Thursday and Friday happy hour, and a chance to visit with other guests. The hotel will supply beach mats, chairs, umbrellas and towels for your whole visit. (Very nice!!) We walk alot so the trek to Waikiki with our supplies wasn't too much of an issue, but the better beaches are at the far end from this location, so we did hop on a bus a couple of times. Also took the bus to Hanauma Bay one day, and to Diamond Head for a hike on another. (I recommend going EARLY to both places, expecially the hike!) Rented a car one day to explore the island. Beautiful beaches within a half hour drive. Weather was perfect, especially compared to the rest of the USA, and we will definitely consider another February trip!

Hawaii is definitely beautiful from the air, and even more so on the ground. Oahu, being one of many islands of Hawaii, offers a balanced mix of city life and rugged countryside. This time I, my husband, and my toddler stayed in The Equus Hotel; a charming boutique hotel on Waikiki’s Upper West Side.We were greeted with Aloha from every member of the staff. Upon check in, we were served refreshing chilled fresh juice. The check in process was fast. After signing some forms, I was given the key to the room and we got a beautiful lei made of shells as a souvenir.I enjoyed the theme of the hotel. The name “Equus” is derived from the word “equestrian”, which is featuring horseback riding. Equus Hotel is keeping true to the theme with Ralph Lauren-inspired details throughout.What we love about Equus Hotel:Strategically locatedThe hotel is close to Ala Moana Center, the largest open air mall in world. It took us less than 10 minutes walk to the mall. It is also close enough to the center of Waikiki where you can swim in the ocean, wine and dine under the stars, or just stroll around the stores. It is nice to be able to go to places within walking distance. My toddler enjoyed the walk and she was happy she was not stuck in a car.Energy efficientI liked this display on the reception desk that shows how to turn on the AC in the guest room. You need to insert your room key to a slot in the wall in order for the AC to run. The AC will be turned off when you remove the room key from the slot and leave the room. This is a great initiative to save energy.Sealed toiletriesAnother great initiative by Equus Hotel is their biodegradable earth-friendly amenities. I am impressed that they seal the toiletries bottles to ensure they are new and never been used. The leftover toiletries are donated to shelters and recycled into other products.Unique detailsEquus Hotel put details in the guest room that I didn’t find in other hotels. The staff artfully folded some towels into animal shapes. This is great for entertaining little kids. My toddler had a good time holding the “duck” and pointing at the “swan.” It put a smile on my face the moment I entered the room and saw these cute animal shaped towels.Popular brewing techAnother nice surprise was the Keurig mini brewing system in every room. It is so easy to use. You can bring your favorite K-cup pod and brew it in the comfort of your room! To satisfy your sweet tooth, they provide you mini cookies to go with your coffee or tea. Or you can share the cookies with your little ones. They always appreciate sweets.Towels, towels, and more towelsI stayed at many hotels before, and a couple of times I had to call the housekeeping and asked for extra towels. But at Equus Hotel, that didn’t happen. They provide the guests with plenty of towels. There were probably 16 towels with various sizes in the room that we stayed in. Those are great if you stay with little kids, as “messy” is their middle name.Affordable in-room diningWhen I stay in a hotel, I am always curious about their in-room dining. I rarely order any food from hotel because their price is usually astronomical ($25 for a simple breakfast, anyone?). Here at Equus Hotel, the in-room dining price is very reasonable. They are even cheaper than some restaurants outside of the hotel. So, the next time your little ones get hungry and ask for a meal, or if you want to snack on something, you don’t have to feel guilty when you order from their menu.CribThey do provide a crib. Just ask, and they will set it up for you. Now, don’t think about a crib with metal bars and curved tops. It is a simple travel crib. The kind that you see in baby store. It does the job and helped my toddler to get the rest she needed.Text for anythingI love to text. I text more than I call. When I learned that Equus Hotel has a number that you can text when you need anything during your stay at the hotel, I was all over it! I had to wait for the crib, so I texted them that I hadn’t gotten the crib set up yet. Within seconds, they responded. It keeps the communication going between guests and the staff. You can also send them a text and ask them about things to do around the island, even when you are not in the hotel. I love this feature a lot.Deal packagesEquus Hotel offers several deals, e.g. business deal, advance booking deal, per diem deal, and fashionista deal. Check back often because they change the deals every now and then. We stayed with the fashionista package, and the deal was awesome. We got $30 Ala Moana Center giftcard, $20 Uber credits, and many more! Very worth it.What’s more from Equus Hotel:If you travel to Oahu and stay at Equus Hotel during polo seasons in April – August, you are in for a treat. Equus Hotel offers complimentary transportation to Hawaii Polo Club in North Shore (the world’s only beachfront polo field), free table at the clubhouse, and two complimentary admission tickets to the polo matches. If you love polo, or if you are curious about it, don’t forget to take advantage of this generous offer.Room for improvement:Though I like the “home away from home” coziness of the hotel, there are several areas that can be improved. Some of them are: flat pillows, very basic shower head, small-sized safe that will not fit a laptop.Another drawback is the steep stairs to go to the entrance of the hotel. Although Equus Hotel makes sure all guests know about this situation by mentioning it in the reservation page, I was still surprised by it. If you travel with kids in stroller, you will need to pick up the stroller and go up many steps.Recommended for:After staying at Equus Hotel and reviewing its features, this wonderful boutique hotel would be suitable for:- People who don’t’ mind the stairs.- People who love horses. They can take advantage of the equestrian experience offered and to travel to Hawaii Polo Club in North Shore. Free of charge!- People who travel light.- Tourists who spend a lot of time outside of the hotel. There are so many things to do close to the hotel location.","Los Angeles, California","OneSleepyMommy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",9,5.0

Very friendly staff and they were more than happy to offer assistance. Location was good - we were able to walk just about anywhere and you're close to the beach and to stores, etc. Beds were quite comfy and pillows as well. We were greeted with fresh pineapple juice which was wonderful. Rooms had a fridge and a nice coffee maker and tv was nice too. What didn't I like. You have to go up a flight of stairs. They helped with our luggage but if no one was there, that could be rough. No breakfast is available there. The rooms are very limited on outlet space. There were 2 of us in the room and we had one open outlet to charge our devices. The air took a while to cool the room off but once it's on, you really hear it. We were on a main street so between the traffic and the air, you have a constant flow of noise. The first night I didn't sleep well at all because of it. Bring ear plugs, they help. The shower was tiny! Shaving your legs wasn't an easy task. And the toilet flush could have woken the people down the hall! Also, there wasn't much light in the bathroom or by the mirror by the beds. So maybe it's because it was a business trip, or because it was my first time here.

It was a nice touch since it was so hot! the hotel is right on the main street so there's a lot of street noise. The room is old but clean. There's not much room inside so definitely wouldn't be room for kids. we paid about $200 for 3 nights plus another $75 for parking I think. The parking is valet only, but it's the same price as what it said in the hotel description. The guys are really quick at getting your car though. We knew that we would be out and about all day and we just needed a room to shower and sleep in, so this place was perfect for that. The street noise didn't bother us at all since we crashed every night. There is a small pool here, but we didn't use it and didn't see anyone else using it either. This hotel is just 2 blocks from the marina and is at the quieter end of waikiki beach. There's an abc store a block away and several places to eat within a couple of blocks.

At 9:30 AM I arrived at The Equus. I was greeted by the Valet (I'll get to their amazing service later). The valet helped me bring my luggage up where I was greeted by a smiling face. His name was Kevin. I asked if there was any possibility of checking in early. He apologized and said that check in was at 3. I explained that I hadn't slept in 24 hours, and if there was anything that could be done to please let me know. He said he'd look up and see what could be available seeing that the cleaning crews probably weren't available to clean a room so quickly. Kevin welcomed me to sit in the lobby, letting me know where a plug was so I could charge my dying phone. As I got comfortable in the lobby chair, and took a few work calls (real estate never stops, vacation or not) I all of a sudden saw Kevin come over and let me know that he found a room for me! I was ecstatic!! It had only been 10 minutes!!!!! I was able to check into my room at 9:45 AM. I felt like the staff truly cared! I had a little trouble getting into my room and a staff member stayed with my stuff while I went down to get a new key. Valet! Just as amazing!! After one day they knew exactly which car was mine and immediately ran off to grab it when I'd come around the corner! Totally worth the 20 bucks (ish) a night!!

I just wanted to give these guys the review they deserve. *From the moment we arrived we were given exceptional treatment. A gentleman greeted us with cold pineapple and guava juice. He was a very welcoming and one of the nicest people I have met. The entire front desk is this way, extremely nice and helpful. They asked me if I wanted help every time I carried something. They even kept the lobby stocked with cold fruit infused water. *Room was just as advertised, nothing broken, nasty, or worn out. *Some reviews I read prior to arriving had mentioned noise so I asked for a room towards the back and I stayed on the 8th floor, no noise problem that I could tell. *Housekeepers are amazing! Always made sure I had plenty of everything. They cleaned really well, our beds always looked amazing. I know the difference between a good cleaning and cut corners, these guys did great! *The location could not be better. Within a couple blocks to Ala Moana Park beach and the shopping center, this had a huge variety of food to eat in the food court. My kids loved the beach there. I drove them down to Waikiki beach and they asked to go back to the one by the hotel. It is calmer and we even did a little of snorkeling there seeing fish with wings and some others. It is also close to Sam's club, Walmart, and Starbucks. We was able to park in the garage across the street for $7 per night, and at the marina for either $8 per night or $1 per hour which was perfect for daytime. I would definitely rent a car. While we stayed at The Equus we was able to go to Sea Life Park (kids loved swimming with the dolphins), Chief’s Luau (favorite part of trip to all of us, funny!), Hanauma Bay (amazing! fish everywhere), Waimea Valley waterfall (great experience), Diamond Head (hard hike but worth it), Pearl Harbor (good for kids to learn first-hand), Aloha Stadium swap meet (bought a lot of clothes and gifts for cheap), and several beaches (the lagoons at Ko olina were nice, swam with a turtle there in lagoon #1). *I have a 7 year old daughter and 17 year old son, both of which loved everything we did. They even loved the hotel, so much so that they wanted to spend the last day of Hawaii in the room. For the price I was expecting some disappointment, but there was absolutely none. The only thing I can even consider mentioning is that the pool was a little small. However if you go to Hawaii and spend your time in a hotel pool rather than at the beach across the street, maybe you should have just saved your money and rented a hotel with a pool by your house. My daughter swam in it once but after going into the ocean across the street she decided a pool was definitely not as much fun. I absolutely loved this hotel and all the staff in it, we have no complaints. We will definitely be back. Oahu was such a great experience. The people are the nicest, friendliest, and laid back that we have ever met. No one even honks or yells at all the lost tourist driving horribly (me). I'm in love with Oahu and all of its locals.

Very close to Ala Moana beach which is quieter than Waikiki beaches. Also near to Ala Moana Centre which pretty much has all the shops that Waikiki has. Room was decent size and clean. Shower and A/C worked well. Housekeeping was efficient although could be late some days. Wifi had okay speeds in the room.Negatives: Noise levels were very high due to outside traffic - almost unbearable in morning rush hour (we were on third floor). Reception staff although friendly were at times incompetent. We booked a double room but were given a twin room because the staff at front desk thought we were a party of three rather than two. He later admitted it was because another person was standing behind us (subtle racism I guess as the person behind was asian). The same person at front desk also said not to worry about parking and to speak to him on the day when we had the car. We did this but he then said we should have made a reservation beforehand as parking was limited and was full.Safety deposit box in the room requires an actual key from front desk which costs $50 if you lose it.Overall this hotel is good value for money. It would be a lot better if the person at front desk actually gave useful information and if the rooms had better sound proofing.","Birmingham, United Kingdom","hanovercigars</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",19,3.0

The city bus dropped me off very close to the hotel entrance, and when I arrived a courteous young man carried my bag up the entry stairs for me. The front desk staff were very helpful and gracious-- they gave me some suggestions of things to do and places to go in the area. The location is fantastically convenient-- on the edge of Waikiki right near Ala Moana Shopping Center, Ala Moana Beach Park, and all of the action and craziness of nighttime Waikiki. There is an ABC store on the block for any late-night purchases you might need to make, and a great affordable diner called the Wailana right down the road. Because of all of this convenience, I found that my decision to save some money (and stress) by not renting a car was totally practical. If you can get away with it, don't rent a car for your stay in Honolulu! When I travel, I look for comfort and convenience, and my room did not disappoint. The A/C kept me cool, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was clean. It was a fantastic place to rest in between my adventures on Oahu. In the morning, I was pleasantly surprised to find an included light breakfast in the lobby area. After my morning swim a five minute walk away at Ala Moana Beach, I came back to the hotel and took a dip in the little pool, which is surrounded by tropical foliage for a jungly feel. All in all, I felt that this hotel offered a lot more than I expected, given its price point and location.

When we went we paid roughly $110 a night. The rooms were very clean, comfortable and very green friendly. Having a private lani and A/C unit was nice. Very comfortable and cute hotel with nice decorations, very comfortable beds, clean rooms with no real issues. The Keurig that comes with the room was very dirty and hard to use however, so I think they need to work on cleaning those on a more regular basis. There are complimentary cocktails a couple days a week which was a pleasant surprise and they were very tasty good Mai Tai's. The location for the price was the number one draw for this hotel as we are college kids on a college budget and this worked out great for all of us. Being really close to the Ala Moana Beach was incredible because it was a much less crowded beach then Waikiki. It was also within walking distance of Waikiki and we could see the fireworks from the Hilton from our room. One great feature of this hotel is the text assistance from the staff. They text you as soon as you check in and are available 24/7 to answer any questions you have about the hotel or the local area. The two worst parts of this hotel is that 1. The street noise was awful, I could hardly sleep. Granted I am a very light sleeper so I know it was worse for me than most, but it was a problem. By the end of the stay I was simply exhausted from hardly sleeping through the noise. My boyfriend is a very heavy sleeper and he too had trouble sleeping through the noise all night long. Our two friends however were in the room next to us and were not bothered by the noise at all, so I think it has to do with how close you are to the main road there, as our friend were further back then us. 2. The pool was broken down and nobody told us. We just went to go check it out and it was brown and gross looking so we did not go in. The next day there was an out of order sign on the entrance, which was disapointing. While there are beaches all around, the pool was an advertised feature that we could not use and were not told by staff that we could not use. But that really was not a big issue, as we spent most of our time at the beach. Mostly the main problem was the noise. The service was great, the beds were great, the rooms were clean and cool and comfortable. Enjoy your stay! We will probably stay again, but ask for a quieter room.",,Caity-Ann S,1,4.0

I wasn't expecting much, since it had such bad reviews here on TripAdvisor, but I was REALLY surprised at how clean and nice this hotel was. I will admit this is one of the harder hotels that I've ever had to find and I would recommend calling the desk ahead of time for them to tell you they are about 400 feet past McDonalds. And the parking is limited, but there's not much they can do about this either. But the room was spotless, beautifully decorated and had perfect and fast Internet. I found the front desk staff very helpful and wanting to go out of their way to make sure my stay was without a problem. They even sent up a sliced fresh pineapple when I asked for some ice. The hotel doesn't even mention they are only a five minute walk from one of the biggest shopping centers in Hawaii--that has 230 stores. It took me nearly two hours to talk past all the stores on a Sunday afternoon, without even stopping in a store. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel. If the previous reviews were accurate, then I think it is clear that the hotel has worked hard to improve its problems.

If I had to say some negative things about this hotel, I would have to say that that the building looks blah from the outside, although the entranceway is nicely done with a brass hand rail, and brass strips on the steps that are polished every day.

She went the whole nine yards and more to investigate and see what was going on(called them and waited on phone and emailed them, told me to recheck bank acct, and did amazing follow ups via email and phone for two days). Eventually amoma contacted myself and Rene,they stated they would refund me the $122 because they charges for a night when there were no open rooms at that time (weird to charge for nothing).Never again will I book through Amoma, poor customer service, impossible to get a hold of them. It was very frustrating trying to get stuff processed but Rene assured and was by my side on top of everything and extremely friendly.

We (my husband, 6 month old baby, and self) chose the Equus as our home base. Our room (two double beds with a mini fridge on the 8th floor) faced other hotels and the marina. Our total for five nights with taxes plus parking was just over $650, which is a steal in Waikiki. The room wasn't too noisy, it was clean and had decent water pressure. The customer service was excellent. The folks at the front desk and the concierge were very friendly and helpful. The only things that might be negative (which were not issues for us at all) were that you have to climb a flight of stairs to get to the front desk. I could be mistaken but I did not see an elevator to get to the front desk. So if you have a lot of bags or are unable to walk this could be a problem. The other issue was that there are only about ten parking spaces under the hotel. These are $20 a day. There is parking across the street for the same price. We were able to get a parking space on site for each of the six days that we were there. The location was very close to the Waikiki Beach the Hilton resort complex with all of its restaurants and shops.

That having been said, this hotel is WONDERFUL. The rooms are beautiful and the beds beyond comfortable. Out of the mainstream Waikiki, right on the edge which made it great. Walk down the block and you have everything, bus service, car rentals, fast food, slow food, and the nightlife/daylife of Waikiki. Within walking distance also is the Ala Moana Shopping Center and the convention Center.The staff is helpful and go out of their way to be of service. I have stayed in larger hotels where I paid double to triple the amount that The Equus cost and not had nearly as much service and been as comfortable as there. This hotel treats you like family and makes you feel like you are the only person staying there with their attentiveness. Definitely a place to come ""home"" to at the end of the day and anytime you are on Oahu. As their sign says ""E Como Mai"" (welcome home).

We stayed in the one bedroom suite (for which I could hardly find any reviews) and it was awesome. The bedroom was very spacious with plenty of room to open all of our (many) suitcases and still walk around. There was a nice leather recliner by the window. The furnishings were tasteful and the bed was extremely comfortable (I am picky)! There was a real door to close, so I could sleep while my spouse had the lights on in the other room (main room). The main room was a combination of a living room (couch + coffee table + a giant TV screen) /dining room (round table + 2 chairs) plus an eat-in kitchen. There was also a partial ocean view from this room. The kitchen had a microwave, a fridge AND a (big) wine cooler, a Keurig coffee maker, nice granite countertops and 4 barstools (in case you invite guests?). Too bad we didn't see pictures of this before we booked, though I can see pictures NOW on the website (so y'all can have a look a priore, not like me who went in blind). This room was on the 10th floor (top) and for someone like me who prefers to take the stairs most of the time, it was nice that the building stairs were accessible at all times and were lit at all times (not by motion sensors like most Waikiki hotels). Since the lobby is on 2, it was only 8 short flights up and down, far quicker than the elevator.Now about the staff. They were the best. Attentive, available, very pleasant, and also able to keep their distance when we didn't need anything. There is clearly someone on staff who is very good at origami, because there were pieces of paper AND TOWELS shaped like animals all over the rooms. I've never stolen anything from any hotel in my life, but I was very tempted to take the towel folded in the shape of a duck home with me :)There was a professional photographer at the hotel when we were there (who tried to grab me into some shots - I declined), so hopefully that means more pictures will be online, which I think is great.The pool barely exists, but I didn't care (there's an ocean, yo). The hotel is not in the hub of waikiki but almost at the edge, right by the canal. That was fine for me, but if your plan is to experience Waikiki 100% of the time then you might want to be more centrally located.

Found the hotel to be very well maintained, great room (little small) clean well appointed. The staff was excellent. Two drawbacks, with windows open you will hear traffic, however I've been in places in Waikiki that charged twice as much and had worse noise. Oddly accessing the hotel from the parking area is a little bit of a challenge. From parking to the lobby you go out to the street down the sidewalk and up two short flights of stairs and then into the lobby. It was easy but if you have any mobility issues at all it could be difficult. With all that said for $130 a night including tax and parking in Waikiki it was a great value for a quality place.

It felt a tad strange to me, but that was minor. The location is excellent, one block away from the water, a few blocks over to the main Waikiki beach. Figure a ten minute walk. Parking was a worry but the clerk said they don't sell (it's an extra daily fee, like all hotels in the area) more slots than they have (I counted 13). But it's really only suitable for small cars. There also is a public garage across the street.The room had two chests of drawers, 3 drawers each, plus smaller drawers in the night tables, and a closet. I found the bed very soft, but I find that at most hotels. There are plenty of restaurants and stores nearby - you have the whole Waikiki hotel/tourist district. Because of the orientation of the rooms you do get noise from Ala Moana Blvd, but that seemed to drop off about midnight.Pros: in-room coffee maker (a Keurig!!), in room safe (with a key, not electronic though), and good service when I needed more hangers. There is a small outdoor terrace. Refrigerator in the room without mini-bar (I hate those). Good shower with pressure and hot water, and plush soft towels.Cons: the icemaker is down in the lobby, the chairs were not very comfortable, and the table was a bamboo style so the rounded pieces are not a good writing surface. The lighting wasn't very good, especially for reading. And some small things that show lack of attention to detail - drawers that didn't close properly and in all the days there the cleaning person never replaced (or moved or cleaned) my water glasses - that seemed strange I've never had that happen anywhere else.

It's more upscale and is distant from the noise and chaos of Kuhio Street. You can walk to downtown Waikiki Beach in 15 minutes, or ride The Bus.Check-in is 3:00 pm. When we arrived shortly after noon Friday, our room was not yet ready, so the front desk staff stored our luggage while we went to Diamond Head.Our first night here, the hospitality staff was serving complimentary Mai Tai's (no limit per guest) in the outdoor lounge next to the lobby. This is their custom every Thursday and Friday evening. Each one of the half dozen staff members we met is incredibly friendly, helpful, personable. We enjoyed meeting some of the other hotel guests during cocktail hour.The décor here is equestrian themed. Furnishings are beautiful. We were shown two types of rooms - The Bamboo Room, which has one queen bed, and a king room. I loved the Bamboo Room décor, but we guessed that my very tall husband would bang his head on the 4-poster frame if he got up during the night, so we chose the king room. Our room on the 6th floor has gorgeous views from the balcony, where two can sit at the patio table and enjoy the weather. Both nights we've left the sliding door wide open because the ocean breeze here is magnificent. No air conditioning needed. The king bed is exquisite ... just soooo comfortable. Several pillow choices facilitate finding just the right one for pleasant dreams.The king room is somewhat crowded, with all the furnishings, and we had to get creative to place all of our luggage where it would be accessible, but we found nooks for all four pieces. One entire wall of the room is mirrors, so you don't get a claustrophobic feeling at all.The king room has a cute wood mini-dinette table with two chairs, a bureau for clothes, two night stands, and a full size luggage bench. The kitchenette counter area is pretty granite with a Keurig coffee maker and Newman's organic coffees. The hotel actually provides raw sugar (hurray!) and Half & Half, instead of the cheap stuff you usually find with hotel coffee service.The mini-refridge has a freezer so you can bring ice cream up to your room ! No microwave though, so drink your coffee before it cools.The bathroom is smallish, with the vanity/sink area separate from the shower/toilet section. There is no tub so, if you want a soak, you have to go down to the first floor ""Refresh"" pool. Towels are thick and fluffy, and our housekeeper left us her personal greeting - a chickadee she made out of washcloths ! We delight in those little ""above and beyond"" services. I love the toiletries - non-toxic Earth Tempo brand. And they actually supply body wash, along with the usual bar soap, shampoo, conditioner, lotion. A step above 90% of other hotels in this respect. The free Wi-Fi connection actually works here, unlike the last hotel, which saves money on visits to Starbucks. The wall-mounted flat screen TV is only about 27 inches, but I doubt most visitors to Hawaii are sitting in their hotel rooms watching TV, so screen size is not very relevant. The safe is the old-fashioned kind with a key. Don't lose your safe key because the hotel will have to charge you $50 to replace it. I'd read some complaints about the elevator, but we've had no problem with it. There is only one elevator for ten floors, so sometimes it takes awhile to arrive. But there's no problem whatsoever traveling up and down, and it's certainly not in danger of breaking down. There is no fitness center or restaurant on site, but dozens of restaurants are within a ten minute walk in either direction. I believe the only private gym in Waikiki is 24 Hour Fitness (15-minute walk), and you can pay on a per visit basis if you must work out during your stay. My one complaint would be that there is no recycle bin in the room, since this is a bronze level ""green"" hotel. But that won't keep me from staying at Equus next time we return to Oahu.

Parking was extra (I had a car for work visits) and a little tight, but worked out OK. Elevator was somewhat slow, but I have found this to be the case at multiple other properties as well.

Very friendly staff greeted me as soon as I checked in, even refreshing me after a long flight from Japan with a cool glass of Lemonade. I enjoyed the texting service the hotel offers. You can text how they're doing service-wise, any trouble issues, or help on deciding where to find a good local spot. The room was outstanding, very comfortable bed. Let me re-state, very, very comfortable. Fridge and all the normal amenities included, Wi-Fi, cable television, etc. Also, the hotel is very environmentally friendly, with eco shampoo/conditioner, a system that shuts off air conditioning and lights when you remove your room key, as well as neat hotel pens made from recycled materials. The key lesson of geography is ""location, location, location"" and this hotel has that. It's not right on Waikiki Beach, and that's fantastic. If you want the beach, it is laughable walk of less than five minutes. Restaurants galore are nearby, both local and chain restaurants (Da Smokehouse was a personal favorite). ABC stores are a plenty in the area, including one less than 50 yards from the front of the hotel. And the best part of being tucked away off the beach, is no drunk people bothering you late at night, as well as no tourists creating loud noises that carry up to your window. The only gripe one may have is that parking is not free (though no hotel in Waikiki is), it is $20 daily for a handful of spots or $20 for overflow parking across the street. Many tourists will complain about this, but the Equus parking charges are significantly less than other hotels in Waikiki who will charge upwards to $70 daily.

This is a cosy little hotel near Waikiki Beach. It is only one street back from the beach, within walking distance of Aloe Moana shopping centre, McDonalds, ABC convenience stores. restaurants and boutique shops. The staff are very pleasant and friendly, the rooms are small but clean and comfortable and they have free cocktail hour every Thursday and Friday. The reason we chose this hotel over others we were researching was the free wi-fi they offered. My daughter recently stayed in the Hilton Hawaiian village hotel which advertises free wi-fi, however you can only access this from the lobby not your rooms. We had no problem accessing the wi-fi throughout the hotel, including our rooms. There is a $20 per night fee for parking which seems a bit excessive, however we felt that as we got a reasonable rate for the room we didn't mind paying the extra $20 for the convenience. There was also a coffee machine that looks a bit like the Aldi ones that uses pods, but it is really only a machine that makes brewed coffee/tea not espresso. There is a fridge in the room but no other coffee or tea making facilities. It would be nice to have a least a kettle in which to be able to make an instant coffee. I was a little disappointed to hear there was no laundry in the hotel, however, there was a public laundry in the McDonalds building a couple of minutes away, it's pretty dingey but it gets the job done.

So if you get in late and leave early you can reduce your parking cost. The hotel itself is fine. Also make sure you understand that the beach is a few blocks away. They have beach towels for guests.

I have stayed in a number of Hawaiian hotels- more expensive with fancy pictures on their website only to end up in flea ridden dowdy room. This place is really nice & comfortable- feels like a home away from home. Service: From parking our car ( FREE- I might add) to check in and check out - I found the staff so helpful, welcoming & friendly. They do as much as they can to help you settle in and get the most out of your vacation. If you have any issues at all you can text them & they will sort it out straight away- even if you are out and about around Waikiki & looking for a restaurant recommendation. Location: this hotel is located opposite the Hilton Hawaiian Village- making it easy to explore the rest of Waikiki. Parking is free & the biggest Shopping Mall in Hawaii- the Ala Moans centre is literally a 5 min walk away from the hotel. You really have the best of both worlds- great shopping & access to Waikiki Beach across the street.Rates: this hotel has recently been remodelled & definitely offers much better rates than other Hawaiian hotels which jack up the prices at a whim. It's family run & that really makes a difference in terms of how they treat their guests. No breakfast but there are so many options around you it really doesn't matter!

My husband and I based our stay from the North Shore of Oahu, but took many excursions from there, one of them being to Waikiki Beach. While in Waikiki, we stayed at the very charming Equus Hotel. I can't speak highly enough about this hotel. It is smaller than most of the monstrosities on the beach. With its size comes personal attention. In the main lobby, when we arrived, we were greeted with a tropical cocktail from a very friendly staff member (quite tastey I might add). Check in was a smooth and quick process. They told us that if there was anything they could do to make our stay nicer, to let them know. They even gave us their text number in case we had any questions while out in Waikiki, got lost, etc. We didn't need to use it, but it was a nice touch. The room was beautiful. The decor is based on polo throughout the hotel. The theme continued in our room with many unique pieces and photos. The room was very modern and it was evident that it had been updated recently. It was also meticulously clean, which is very important to us when we travel. The towels were folded to look like swans and were placed on the bed. Again, a nice touch. I recommend this hotel highly to anyone traveling to the area. Among the lure of the high rise hotels, stands out this truly precious gem. On a side note, the hotel is affiliated with Hawaii Polo on the North Shore of Oahu. While we were there, we were able to take a sunset trail ride along the beach. It was one of our favorite moments while on vacation. The beach was quiet and peaceful. And come to find out, it was a unique experience as they are the only ones on the island to offer trail rides on the beach. This was on our bucket list of things to do while we visited and we were not disappointed. ",,Vickcm,4,5.0

Even the bath products were lovely. The room was clean, modern and had clearly been recently upgraded. The air-conditioner was silent and worked beautifully. My only small complaint is the massive bamboo canopy bed structure. In an already small room, this extra bit of ""decor"" takes away from the limited space and makes the room more cramped (to say nothing of tall people bumping their heads) - but that's really a small point.

From the open-aired, canopied entrance with adjacent tropical foliage and brass-trimmed steps, to its early European/Polynesian decor, makes one feel as though they have stepped back to its earlier years of being a polo hotel. It has a feel of simple elegance without feeling ostentatious. Open breeze ways host wonderful black and white prints of the local history. Who would have guessed a cattle drive ever took place on Oahu? The rooms are quaint and comfortable with the shuttered panel doors on the patio-side allowing lots of indirect daylight to enter, when the panels are slid back. Opening both doors allows the warm, tropical trade winds to blow through. The Equus is located at the beginning of the Waikiki area so is a reprieve from the commercial hustle-bustle of tourism, and glitzy hotels of the more heavily foot/auto trafficked areas. Traffic noise is heavy, however this is the norm on the Waikiki strip. The beach, Ala Moana Mall, Ala Moana Park, (where you will find the locals), restaurants, a marina, army museum, car/scooter/motorcycle/surf rentals. shopping centers and other amenities are all within an easy walking distance of a block or more away. It is easy to take advantage of trolleys and buses should you choose not to walk. Staff at the Equus are friendly, professional, and take pride in their facility. The fresh-water pool area is small but clean, maintained and comfortable. The price was exceptional.

When there was a problem with our TV, the front desk sent up a maintenance man promptly, who took care of the issue immediately and courteously. Only issue was that I wasn't able to check in early (although I saw several other people receive keys while I was waiting). However, in the hotel's defense, I was there about 45 minutes before the official check-in time. Front desk staff was generally pleasant. I agree with an earlier review that it was somewhat loud at night, since you're on a major roadway (we were on the 7th floor). I didn't necessarily have difficulty sleeping, perhaps because a roommate put on a white noise app on her phone during the night, but it may be an issue for some. Walk to the convention was easy and quick if using the back entrance (maybe 10 minutes). Wireless Internet quality was good, and rooms were nice and clean. The hotel prides itself on minimal environmental impact, which I thought was great. Be aware that there is no elevator to the ground level (which makes carrying luggage to/from the street difficult), and the elevator between floors is quite slow.

My friend was on the 10th floor and he said apparently the 10th floor has very good sound proofing (and also higher prices). He said he barely heard any road noise. So if you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs or book a room on the 10th floor.Elevator. There's only one elevator and it's slow. You might have to wait a while for the elevator.Location. If you want to do visits to Waikiki, this hotel is a little far unless you take the bus. It's definitely walkable (it's about 1.5 miles away or so) but it's a tad far compared to other hotels when talking about going to Waikiki.Parking. Like most if not all hotels in that area, parking costs money nightly. But they only have like 10 spots and you just have to hope no one steals your spot. I'm not sure if it's possible if you paid for a spot to have your spot taken but the staff seemed to imply this was a possibility. Never happened to us, but it almost did.Getting to front desk. If you have luggage that's hard for you to handle, be warned that there's a few steps that you have to take before you get into the lobby of this hotel. You maybe able to flag someone to help you with your luggage but I wouldn't count on it so expect to carry your luggage up some stairs.

They have a small pool (no jacuzzi) on the property and the rooms are good sized.

Let me begin with the pros because I like to start with good news - great rate, friendly staff, clean room, some version of a balcony. Now for the much longer list of ""Cons"" - No elevator or ramp up at ground level, you have to walk up about 15-20 stairs from the street sidewalk and then you're in the lobby, this is definitely very inconvenient. This also means that either you have to carry your luggage up, or if you're lucky an employee will assist (which means you have to throw money for tip, even if you were planning on taking care of your luggage yourself). Now upon checking in, if your room is not ready they will store your luggage for you - and when your room is ready they will offer to bring it up to your room. The con in this is the comments that might be made when it is dropped off at your room - (after 2 weeks of traveling, including a wedding, we had quite a bit of luggage) - so when the comment is made by, a woman I'm assuming is some sort of manager, ""Moving in?"" it doesn't go over very well. And luggage assistance on the way out? Thats a joke - especially when you are in a hurry to catch your ride to the airport. The elevator takes 5-8 minutes to get to your floor and then you get down to the lobby level, but wait, you need to drag your luggage down 15-20 stairs to the street level. Of course, there is luggage assistance, but it took them 3-5 mins to get outside when if there was a ramp down the street level you would already be down and not having to give a tip.Once in the room - further cons include - VERY small shower space (stand-up only) - woman forget trying to shave your legs in the shower; A/C is operated by a key system - HINT: Get an extra key and leave it in the key system in the room, otherwise you WILL return to a hot and humid room (even if they say that it doesn't turn all the way off, it's closer to off than on); the lanai is not welcoming or even the least bit appetizing to sit out on, and to open the sliding door to it is a chore in itself - bottom line, don't bother. Now, the location is a challenge in itself - it is a taxi ride to Kalakua and Lewers Street area and Waikiki Beach, walking distance to the mall, and walk right out onto the street and you'll be in the homeless territory of the city. I really like how they classify themselves on the ""Upper West Side"" as if you'll be staying in the best part of town - you definitely are not.Overall - I'm glad we only stayed for 1 night - if we were booked for more, I would have moved locations. Pay a few dollars more per night and stay at a nicer place.","Alturas, FL","Ashley J J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alturas, FL</strong>",9,2.0

Is a 10-minute walk to the beach (if you don't mind walking thru the main entrace of one of the beachfront 5-star hotels. Is also 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Mall. So, if on a tight budget and needing to be on the west end of town, you might consider Equus. Otherwise, for the same price, you can stay at the much nicer Wakiki Resort Hotel, but you will be on the other end of town.","Flat Rock, North Carolina","Gary B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Flat Rock, North Carolina</strong>",14,2.0

We choose this hotel last minute because our flight got cancelled. I went off the great reviews I read about the Equus on TripAdvisor. After staying there, I am quite certain those reviewers must have been staying at a different hotel. ""Boutique"" is the hotel's way of saying it is old with thin walls and single pane windows. There was so much noise from the street below I could not sleep and we were on one of the highest floors. I downloaded white noise and used earplugs and still didn't sleep well. The room is small but the bathroom is tiny. There is a huge 2"" gap under the entry door. There are a handful of parking spots under the hotel so we had to hike blocks away and pay $20 a day in a parking garage. We had to climb two flights of stairs from the street to the lobby with bags and children. No elevator. The staff was marginally helpful during our stay.  I would not return to this hotel for any reason. The cost is similar to other nearby hotels, please try one of those instead.","Medford, Oregon","TravelingOnStandby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Medford, Oregon</strong>",9,1.0

We rented a car and did not spend anytime at the hotel during the day. When we were at the hotel, it was everything we could hope for. Everything was comfortable and convenient. It was a short walk (40 yards) from parking to the elevator. We were on the 9th floor and I can say that every room on our floor had an ocean view. Outside our front door we could see the boats in the Marina. The hotel is about a half a mile walk to the main drag in Waikiki which was great because the main street there is filled with people. The front desk handled every request of ours immediately. The staff was so nice and helpful. Pookah was working the front desk during the majority of our stay. He was unbelievable. Yoshi also worked the front desk and was just as helpful. The hotel also has an association with a horse stable in the North shore. We booked a horseback ride through the hotel and were not let down. The trail we rode on was right on the sand on the North Shore and they have a great beach where we brought our own picnic lunch. I would definitely recommend the ride. In the room, there is a medium sized fridge/freezer which was great for keeping our own drinks cold. There is a K-cup coffee maker in the room as well. There is a convenient store open til 1 right around the corner with snacks, drinks (hard and soft) and gifts. Also, a couple blocks inland, there is a Walmart. The room we had had a king size big that was great. There is a great balcony with table and chairs on it which was great for sending email in the morning with some coffee as well as watching the passing traffic with some wine in the evening. The staff was unbelievable. All in all, it was a great trip and staying at the Equus made everything easier for us.

So, I chose this hotel because the AAA rate was $99/night, about $50 cheaper than most affordable hotels. But then I found out that nearby hotels were just as inexpensive and were in a tower with like 20+ floors... oh well.Anyway, I'm going to make this short and bittersweet.Pros: Affordable, very good climate control system, fridge, nice shower, decent internet connection but NO wireless in room, good cleaning service and replacement of shampoos etc, 0.3 miles from Convention Center (where my conference was), 24-hour front desk service, around the corner from an ABC Store (food and stuff), not far from Hilton complex where the closest beach is.Cons: Noise from adjacent rooms is loud. Walls are thin. If this is an issue for you like it was me, make sure to ask for a room that does not have an optional conjoining door, which is the least sound-proof door in the world. Also, I had roaches. At least one per day. I know this is the tropics, but that's just unacceptable. It's basically because the door is about 1cm off the ground, so anything small can get in. Blech. Also, my climate control remote control did not work properly, I think the battery was dying. The volume control on my tv was busted, too, so I didn't bother using the tv. Hair drier was busted.Caution: If you don't like pillow-top beds that make you nearly fall off, don't stay here. If you are freaked out by roaches, don't stay here. If you make a reservation, make sure you know whether it's the Marina Tower or the Equus, as the Equus is old and roachy, and I imagine the Marina Tower is new and roachless (but I'm not sure, obviously).",New Jersey,"dancingphalanges</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Jersey</strong>",48,2.0

So for the entire hotel there are only 7 parking spots...yes that's right 7 and its a first come first serve basis, so your lucky to get one for $20 a day. We were in a minivan and our driver would have to crawl out of the driver window cause there is no room between the spaces (he dropped the rest of us off before parking); Horrible!! The only way to access the hotel is up a flight of stairs...so no ramps. So, good luck if your handicap or have a hard time going up stairs (or have a stroller like we did). The hotel lobby is tiny...I mean it can fit like 4 people or so. The elevators take a very long time and are also slow. We arrived earlier than check in and had requested a early check in but were told when we got there at 8 am that neither of our rooms (we had 2) would be ready til normal check in time of 3pm. So thankfully we had a rental car to keep our luggage in. We believe they handled this very poorly (I have worked in a hotel before and know that it's about accommodating your guests). Our room was suppose to be a king and we received a queen...the hotel room decor is very outdated and not cute! The only place you can use the free wifi is down in the lobby area; which is tiny. The showers were very small leaving it hard to shave my legs. One of the nights, at the hotel next to us, their fire alarm went off and was very loud. Another night a fight broke out in a room below us which kept us up all night (the people involved had to have the ambulance and firefighters called...it was serious).

Excellent location and close to everything. Car rentals, ABC Store, Beach, other hotels and restaurants. Older, dated hotel and room was similar to what you'd expect in Europe, i.e.being efficiently laid out without a lot of extra elbow room. Since we wander and try to discover new things when we travel, we do not spend a lot of time in the room itself. The staff is very helpful and accomodating and make any negatives easier to accept. All in all a good value for the location. The bed was very comfortable and the fridge in the room had a freezer that you can actually utilize. The only downsides for my wife and me, was the lack of a larger dresser/chest of drawers for our clothing and the noise from the street. Because it is an older hotel, the balcony doors do not block out the noise. The last night, I used earplugs and slept well. Because Hawaii is 5 hours behind the East Coast, I assume that everyone goes to work early and subsequently, the street noise starts early. My wife is a sound sleeper, so it didn't bother her as much as it did me.If you want to keep your expenses down, but still be well located, Equus is a good choice. The staff is very friendly and more accomodating to your needs than some very expensive properties that we have stayed at. As strange as it sounds, if you bring some inexpensive earplugs along, you can enjoy a good nights sleep and not be awakened by scooters and traffic noise.","Minnetonka, Minnesota","rgpieper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minnetonka, Minnesota</strong>",29,4.0

On a last-minute visit, we didn't want to inconvenience family so we decided to find a budget hotel conveniently located in town. Equus Hotel was a great find! We used a car for most of our stay (and had no problem getting a parking space in the small lot every night), but we did some walking, too. The hotel is on the edge of Waikiki (not centrally located), but it isn't a bad walk to other Waikiki hotels or the beach. It was actually pretty nice to stroll through the nearby Hilton Hawaiian Village grounds (beautiful hotel, fancy shopping area, penguins!) and Fort DeRussy (also beautiful to walk through; excellent running paths). If you head in the other direction, over the bridge by the harbor, it's an easy walk to Magic Island (beach/park) or Ala Moana Shopping Center, a local favorite for good food and shopping. There are nice restaurants and bars, but Makai Market is my personal favorite! It's not a standard mall food court-- I could eat there every day and find something different and delicious. Check it out- it has 4 stars on Yelp!SURROUNDINGS: Like most of Waikiki, this neighborhood is part tourist area and part low-rent apartments, so there are homeless or practically-homeless and random people hanging around. I would advise visitors to be street-smart like in any tourist area, but I definitely wouldn't say this area is at all dangerous or uncomfortable. In fact, Kalakaua Ave feels much nicer than some parts of Kuhio Ave that actually has prostitutes and shady characters on the street. In general, don't worry-- Hawaii people are pretty friendly and easy-going so it's unlikely you'll run into any unsavory situations.LOBBY: Non-existent. It's super small, typical of boutique hotels, but don't judge this hotel solely by the lobby. The staff is awesomely friendly and helpful, and the rooms are comfortable. If you are staying in the lobby building, there is just one, very slow elevator. We opted for the stairs that led to the garage because it was close to the car and good exercise. On our last day, they stored our bags for free, and I found out that they sometimes hold bags for a couple weeks for international visitors who use it as a home base while taking other trips across the Pacific or to the outer islands!ROOM: Stayed in the main building (not the Marina Tower). King bed, very comfortable. Really liked the bar area with mini-fridge and wide counter space. No bugs at all, like I've read in reviews of the Marina Tower. Horse-themed photographs and decorations were quirky but not too ridiculous. No sound problems with neighbors or cars. Private balcony with table and chairs- we used it to dry our swimsuits. It was nice to get fresh air in the room, but don't get excited for the view. From the 6th floor, we could see a bit of ocean, but mostly just the apartment building next door. Not pretty, not tourist-y, just regular and urban. BATHROOM: Limited privacy. If you will be sharing this room, note that the bathroom door is a sliding wooden door that may not close completely. Also, the bathroom is crazy small, with an unusually-configured toilet/shower area-- feeks like a locker room. Two people really can't be in this space at the same time. For example, brushing your teeth next to each other in front of the short sink/counter is awkward, and with the closet right behind you, there's no room for anyone to get past you while you're standing at the sink. Personally, I felt that the small, weird bathroom was fine because it was clean and I enjoyed the room overall at the price we paid.POOL: Give up- it's tiny, pathetic, and in a weird, unexpectedly windy, and cramped location. But who wants a pool in Hawaii? Go to the gorgeous beach across the street!!!BREAKFAST: The hotel gives you a paper voucher for a free hot breakfast (eggs, meat, hashbrowns, toast and juice) or $3 credit towards anything on the menu at a sports bar down the block. We sat outside on the lanai and enjoyed the sun. Right near the loud street, but we still liked it. As long as you keep your expectations reasonable, this is a free, satisfying meal, which I'd prefer over the McDonald's that was across the street.OVERALL: Would definitely stay here again because we had a good experience with the staff, love the location, and this no-frills hotel met our basic needs for a good price (booked through Orbitz w/a discount code).","Los Angeles, California","J-biztraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",6,4.0

Price2. No microwave in the room (They want to warm your food up for you in a nasty employee break room. They don't want u to enter, I guess bc it's so dang nasty!!! I insisted on warming up my own food. If I was the Board of Health, I would shut this room down. The microwave alone was so disgusting!!!!)3. No laundry facilities (they told me to walk down the street)4. The Internet Ethernet cable is super glued to the back of a dresser. Therefore, u have to sit next to it to use it. If not, you'll have to move the dresser elsewhere. Wifi in the lobby that's about 2x2. 5. No informational guide in the room about ordering food or any nearby restaurant listing. Thank God for Siri. Although, Outback Steakhouse and Red Lobster are about a 2 min walk. 6. They took my personal washcloth!!7. I called for toilet paper and it took so long that I had to go and get it. 8. The refrigerators do not keep your items cold. 9. There is a lot of city noise and parking is very minimal!!!Good:1. Good thing - Clinton was very helpful. 2.

Our room was tiny, but the shower was the smallest of the small--no bigger than 3.5 x 3.5 feet. We found it difficult to turn around, and the hot water took forever (I'm talking a good 3-5 minutes to arrive). The bathroom was small with little counter space. As with most hotel bathrooms, there were not enough places to hang towels. (How much does a hook cost, anyway?) The toilet had such a powerful flush that it left the toilet seat wet after every use. The bedroom was small, as was the balcony, which had no light for reading at night. My husband found the bed acceptable, whereas I found the mattress too soft. There were two wicker-rattan chairs, which were uncomfortable when watching TV (we are not bed TV watchers). The room had a large armoir with a few small drawers and a gaping space--not too functional overall. Lighting was poor for reading. The refrigerator was not as cold as it could have been, although there was a nice granite countertop, which added useful space. There were no parking spaces available the entire time we were there, so we had to pay $20 a night across the street. Other than its limitations, the Equus was clean and offered some nice touches. First, service was impeccable. The front-desk night clerk, Clinton, was absolutely wonderful--an exemplary model of what every front desk person should be--courteous, friendly, attending to our every need. There were also complimentary copies of the Wall Street Journal, an inviting pool (though quite small), and an invitation to attend an evening wine tasting in the lobby. The hotel had an optimal location--close to Waikiki and Ala Moana Mall as well as many popular restaurants.

I have read other reviews that were mixed, but I am here to set the record straight.  Being Canadian, and living in Santa Monica, California I travel quite frequently all over the world for my conferences. Often, I stay at Hilton's and Sheraton's. Yes they are clean and nice, but they have no character or Charm. The Equus is a boutique Hotel in the best most central location in Waikiki in my opinion. The rooms all have there own theme and are very charming. If you can get a higher floor that would be ideal. Also, next door they own and you might be able to stay at the Marina Towers, those are also lovely accommodations and in certain cases you have a kitchen to cook. The upper floor views on the Harbor are breathtaking in this tower.  The best part of staying at the Equus and Marina Towers is the staff. They cater to your every need from beach towels, to directions to fixing any problem you may have. By far the 2 best employees are Rene and Clinton. Not only are they capable people but so warm and friendly. Clinton, is a Jack of all trades and knows so much about any subject you can ask him about the Hotel and the Island. Rene is the best. The hotel would not function without her, she truly is the Michael Jordan of that establishment. Be sure to deal with her, as she can make the difference between having an average vacation, and a once in a lifetime memorable Hawaiian dream stay. She is like the producer of movie who puts the whole movie together or like a good captain of a ship. She directs all her employees and guest and never cracks under pressure. In concluding, I would 100% refer and recommend this Hotel and Tower to any of my colleagues, friends and family.In fact, I am going to book my annual trip with them today.See you in HawaiiMahalo nui loa","Los Angeles, California","Canadian07717</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",10,5.0

Still could hear the road but it was better. And it got even better when I laid down on the bed. I mean this is like the most comfortable bed in a hotel or cabin I can remember. Soft pillow-top. It is a King and is absolutely so comfortable. The room is nice too with some antique looking furniture and granite above the mini fridge.And we got used to busy, alley-like feel of the place.

We arrived early we were checked right in great with amazing fruit drinks. The lady at the front desk was a RAY OF SUNSHINE. I think her Name is Rene. Every time i went into lobby i was greeted with a beautiful smile. We didn't use the parking garage but i needed a space for one night for my son's car so we could all travel together to paradise cove. Went in and my Ray of Sunshine said not problem gave me the spot. And when i returned the key She remembered where i was going and asked how it was. To me that is perfect customer service ... Now for the room Clean everything we needed . Our cleaning staff was so nice Fely and Grace. There wasn't one person on staff that wasn't so sweet I can guarantee that next June when we fly our for my Granddaughters first Birthday I will be staying here... One more note I was traveling with my mother who is a Senior and my 12 year old daughter and not once did i not feel safe.. And again that is was very important. All i can say is thank you Staff of Equus marine towers for an amazing stay and experiences..This was a very special trip for my family I got to meet my perfect new grand baby but the hotel i was staying in remembered why my family was there and made our stay perfect...

We arrived late around midnight and the first thing to note is a flight of stairs to climb with your luggage before reaching reception. No problem checking in (room 606), all very friendly. At that time of night there appears to be no one to help us with our luggage but for us this was not a problem. Reception is serviced by one lift but during our stay we never have to wait more than a couple of minutes for it to arrive, the healthy option is to take the stairs if you are in a hurry. Access to the room is by electronic key x 2. The room was clean, tidy and pleasant albeit a little tired, however the super king sized bed was very comfortable. The view from the room's balcony was of the city. There are coffee making facilities, a small fridge, good iron, ironing board, hair dryer, safe, alarm clock, good air conditioner, flat screen TV with cable programming and a wired internet connection with a very long ethernet cable to reach most corners of the room. Having access to a safe is very useful but you need to ask for a key at reception where you are warned that if the key is lost you will be charged $50 - fair enough just don't lose it. We used the safe to keep important documents and currency etc. The hotel has a small swimming pool which isn't frequented that much and I think there is access to a floodlit tennis court, also not used that much. Breakfast is provided in the form of a voucher which was requested and obtained from reception each morning - don't forget to ask because this is not automatically offered. The breakfast was provided by a local sports bar called Snappers (one block away) - can get very busy if you have a late breakfast but all good before 9.30am. Food offered was OK, scrambled egg, bacon or sausage, pancakes or potatoes, toast and fruit juice or coffee, good American atmosphere to start the day. Hotel location is superb, five minutes from the amazing Ala Moana shopping mall. Five minutes walk from Hilton Hawaiian Village and beaches. The bus route close to the hotel is a gateway to the rest of the island. We caught buses (""TheBus"") to top attractions such as Pearl Harbor, Iolani Palace, Diamond Head and the North Shore all for US$2.50 per ride. Tip: Go to the local ABC store, just two minutes from the hotel and buy a four day unlimited pass for US$24 (ask the store how this works). This is a great way to meet the locals and exchange stories. The hotel's housekeeping and maintenance staff were always very friendly. Checkout is at noon and the hotel offers a room to lockup your luggage whilst you spend your final few hours in the city before departing for the airport. Reception was exceptionally helpful when our departing shuttle bus ride to the airport was extremely late to arrive - thanks for this. Small niggles encountered during the nine day stay, traffic noise both day and occasionally night. Also, the last night was had a noisy neighbour move in whom made phone calls all through the night and at the top of his voice - very frustrating but not the hotels fault (obviously he was still in a different time zone). I would without hesitation use this hotel again, we felt comfortable and safe there and it was very good value when compared to other hotels.","Auckland, New Zealand","PHILIP B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",2,4.0

I found openings at the Equus on the west side and decided to try it out. The location is convenient to the key things I like - the beaches at the Hilton complex, the ABC store, the Ala Moana mall. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. The hotel is right on a chief commuting route, and the buildings in this end of Waikiki create a big echo chamber, so expect traffic noise during rush hours, but one is here not to stay in the room but to go out and enjoy Honolulu. The room was the right size for a solo traveler, well appointed, and clean. I liked that they give out Wall St Jrnl's at the front desk, which for me was a nice touch for a business oriented person. They offer an onsite GreenCarHawaii service, which is basically a pay-as-you-go car at $15/hr or $90+/day (ouch! - enterprise and alamo offices are a block away). Didn't use the car but good to have such an option. Grounds were nicely appointed and neat - good places to sit and take up the breezes. All in all, a great value for a solo traveler like me who wants access, willing to walk around, and be in a safe, accommodating hotel.

We had to park by the river and walk over to find the front desk. After check in we had a parking pass and you have to be early to get one, first come first serve. Small garage so don't bring any tanks in there. The room was just big enough for us. The street level noise could be a factor for some, but we found it to be just part of the busy city. Construction goes on after dark and you will have to hear and experience work going on. The room had no kitchenette but had a little fridge. We had a double double room and weren't expecting a kitchen. The major problem we fought with this hotel was only technical. Every time you went below channel 48 you lost your cable tv. The cable went out after you left your room and came back too. We called the front desk 7 times during our 4 night stay to reboot our tv. I also caught the front desk ignoring the phone calls so I knew I had to walk down stairs to tell them to fix my tv again. The maintenance guy was prompt everytime I must say. They gave a different reason every fix. Be patience, don't turn it below 48, and some no reason at all.Be prepared to walk up some big stairs on check in but staff was helpful if they were around. The pool is also small and closes at sundown so don't expect to catch a dip after you're through sight seeing.

At first they got my reservation under the wrong name (they had my last name as my middle name) but Hotwire helped me re-fax the booking and the Equus ended up saying they found my reservation and changed it to my correct last name (super polite/awesome guy who helped me). I also made sure I wasn't staying in the Tower because so many people complained about that.Yes, there's no elevator to the lobby so you need to lug your luggage up, which of course brings me back to my hostel days. And yes there's only one elevator but you never have to wait very long for it. The pool is small but who would swim there if the beach is 5 minutes away? And I've seen them clean the pool. The room was awesome. I was scared there would be cockroaches but after a thorough investigation I found it to be super clean and the room looks like what you see in the picture. It only has a shower stall but it's not so small you can't fit in it (I'm going to attribute this to the fact that they're a Green Association hotel). I also like that they have a very clean fridge with freezer. I've had no issues with the cleaning staff. They've been amazing. Everyone who works here is also super nice. The only drawback is how thin the walls are. You'll hear your neighbour come in and out and if they open the balcony or turn on the TV really loud. Also, Ala Moana is a loud street (drag racing is legal here) so Friday nights are loud. I brought ear plugs but didn't use them and I'm a light sleeper. Breakfast is at Snappers Bar, which is a less than 5 minute walk down Ala Moana served from 8 to 10 AM. It's a lot of food as you get scrambled eggs, toast, pancakes/home fries/rice, sausage/bacon, tea/coffee/juice/soda or you can get $3 off any breakfast menu item. All you need to do is leave tip (I usually left $1 if it was good service and on most days the servers were amazing). Honestly, I've stayed in hostels and this is a real hotel. It is small (hence boutique) but they really make sure you feel welcomed. And I really feel like they listen to customers and make changes accordingly, which is more than I can say about other hotels.","Toronto, Canada","gsventures</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",6,4.0

Having lived on this island before and traveled here many times we know our way around pretty much. This hotel is a good value. Most people who visit do not intend to spend the day in their room which is good in this case in particular as the room we had was small. The bed was very comfortable and the decor was clean and seemingly newly renovated. I wish there was WIFI in the room as the LAN only accommodates 1 computer at a time. There is a decent sized mini fridge and coffee maker. The bathroom area is 2 small rooms; one with sink and closet the other with shower stall (no tub) and toilet. All clean and no problems. There is a small lanai with table and ours looked out over the street and nearby building. The swimming pool is truly postage stamp size but I don't see why you'd want to use the pool when the beaches are so close by.

I had no problem with the internet in the room; however it works only with devices that plug in. My roommate had to get internet on his phone in the lobby or breakfast room. We both found it mildly annoying that we needed a new code every day. Housekeeping was adequate but no gold stars.

We stumbled upon the Equus on the internet and Clinton was able to accomodate us for the three nights of our trip. Clinton had superb customer service skills, they were head and shoulders above any other person we spoke to that day. It was refreshing to speak to a person who genuinely cared about our needs. He booked us a room in the tower on the 10 the floor. There were some undesirable things about that room but we were not able to move until the morning because a member of our party was very sick. The next morning we packed our bags and went to the front desk and spoke with a gentleman. We briefly told him our problem and immediately he asked us to check out a room in the main building. Ur gave us a key and told us he would watch our bags. We went into the room, were blown away with how beautiful it was and went back and told him we'd love to have it. He quickly changed our room and comped our parking for the previous night. He too was extremely pleasant and genuinely concerned about our trip experience. We wrote a letter to the manager (Rene) telling her about our experience and I happened to meet her by happenstance a few hours later and she graciously comped our first nights stay.

Yes, as we walk in. The room was right next to a noisey street. Where all night long we could hear the traffic go over speed bumps. The continental breakfest was funny. It was very limited.

Linelle provided us with a local perspective and gave us the insider information on where to go and what to do. The only downside of the Equus was the trail riding that was supposed to be inclusive of our stay; the Hotel did not inform us that we needed a rental car to participate. That should have been told to us at the beginning when booking our package! And not after we arrived. Maybe a shuttle bus for the guests would be a great solution to offer guests to enjoy the trail riding. After all the hotel's name is Equus!!

No real need for a vehicle, unless you are looking to explore the rest of beautiful Oahu (e.g. the North Shore, where you can go horseback riding on Oahu's most beautiful beach, at Mokuleia Polo Farm). Everything that you need or may want to experience is within walking distance of or a short trolley/bus/taxi ride from this hotel. If you are venturing further than Waikiki, and are in need of a parking spot for your rental vehicle, there is adequate space ($20 USD with in/out privileges). The entrance to the hotel has you climb a set of stairs which passes along side of a quaint garden, bursting with colour and the soothing sound of a babbling fountain. A seating area overlooking the hotel pool, along with the extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly staff which are quite eager to assist you with your luggage and whatever else you may need help with during your stay, greet you at the top. Once you have checked in, an elevator will take you the rest of the way to your room, which will not disappoint. The rooms have stayed true to their roots, maintaining the comfort and authentic style of the island. We stayed in the Classic Executive on the 10th floor, which provided us with Ethernet, bar fridge, desk, a very welcomed pillow-top mattress and comforter, and all the other amenities that you would expect at a boutique hotel. There is a flat screen television as well, but with the activities and spectacular views just outside your room, you will probably not even get around to turning it on. The Equus starts your day off with a complimentary continental breakfast in their comfy lounge, just off to the side of the lobby, and as mentioned earlier, the staff are more than happy to help you make the most of your stay, providing you with maps, brochures and unbiased recommendations pertaining to Oahu before you venture out.

We requested a kIng size bed ~ found a queen with a mattress that looked like the Rocky Mountains. Jason on the front desk was quite attentive. He was wonderful ~ gave us keys to look at other rooms.

Rene's only suggestion was to keep moving us from room to room. One room, someone had broken into the room. The lock had been jimmied ~ plate was loose & door frame damaged. The shower was moldy & smelled. This was supposed to be their best room. OMG! Other than Jason & Jennifer, who both were very helpful in listening, the staff were very rude.Their lies to the family about family created a huge rift. We are now awaiting a report from the Manager Jennifer to resolve the issues. We spent a lot of money to travel there for a family wedding & were grossly disappointed. Amenities that should be in the rooms were just not there & it just did not seem to be a concern to staff. I would never, ever recommend this place. If you are going to Hawaii, you are already spending money for a great vacation. Spend the extra few bucks & go down the street to the Rainbow Tower or the Hilton ~ they are on the beach, have great grounds, pools, restaurants, bars, entertainment & still everything is within walking distance. When in doubt, hop the trolley ~ it takes you just about anywhere. Good Luck! Wish we had known & not depended on the wedding party to book our rooms.

When they saw I was bummed I missed my morning coffee the staff there, (I apologize for my memory as I cant remember the name of the gal working so hard to get the food out to the table each morning) she went and made me a fresh pot, just for me...WOW! where can you find that? ( at home) I made a comment to Puka, one of the other managers, and he stopped what he was doing and chatted with me for quite awhile. He also had no problem when my plane wasn't arriving until late that night and my dad who lives across the street went to check me in. What a great guy..... I wanted to take a picture of my son and girlfriend for graduation and the lady in the lobby who was selling her jewelry gave me her leis that she was using for her display. Who does that?

Fourth of July is a big thing in Hawaii and its always almost impossible to book anything near ala moana beach park and if you do, it isn't guaranteed that you will get a view of the fireworks. I booked this ocean view room one week in advance and requested in the additional comments box, that I would love to view the fireworks for Independence day. THEY ACTUALLY READ MY COMMENTS!! I had called the day I was checking in to confirm my reservation and that's when I had the pleasure of talking to Renee, she was awesome! You could tell that Renee really loves what she does,the aloha in her voice was so accomodating and she was so excited to tell me about the room she set me and my special someone in. She had set us up on the 35th floor overlooking ala moana beach park. The view was so beautiful during the day and at night...it took my breath away. The view of the fireworks over the water was amazing. The room was very comfortable. Air conditioner was already on and the room was cool. The bed was so comfortable, I wrapped myself up in that down comforter and watched the sailboats stream by from the huge windows. The staff also welcomed us with a pineapple and a hand written note welcoming us to the hotel. The floor was quiet and peaceful, so I recommend it for people who really just want to get away and relax. I read some reviews about rooms not being up to par. The Equus Hotel and just the Ocean View Rooms of the Marina tower have been renovated, the other floors of the Marina tower are still undergoing some construction. The location is very ideal, it is right next to Ala Moana mall and a few steps to the beach. I highly recommend this hotel, the price is great, the room is comfortable, and the sevice will ""wow"" you.

For the first week we stayed at the marina tower and after returning from Kauai we stayed in the Equus for two nights. When we arrived they instantly made us feel right at home. There were a few people there that went out of their way to make our time in Honolulu even better than it already was. I won't say there names but you'll know who they are if you go. As Canadians, during the stanley cup playoffs, we were obviously going to be watching a game or two. One of the games they both came (after work hours), had a drink (or two), explained more of the history of Hawaii asked us about life in Canada and we had a blast together. My girlfriend was upset that she was never leid during the trip and on the last day her wish came true because someone (you know who you are) gave one to her to send us on our way.

We are both currently living on the mainland, but I am from Hawaii and stayed at a bunch of places in the area. I read all the reviews but still decided to choose this hotel. we booked our package on Expedia, so hotel and rental for a very reasonable price.First, yes seeing where to pull in is a bit difficult, if you miss it you have to go all the way around the block. There is one stall CLEARLY marked for ""registration"". That small lot (about 10 spaces) under the Equus tower is for HOTEL guests first come first serve. At check in they give you a key fob for the garage for their MARINA tower located right behind the Equus tower. Out of the 6 days we only had to park there 2 nights. And yes it is $18 a day.The rooms are nice, it was clean, clearly newly renovated. Not a huge space, but comfortable for a couple. We stayed in the EQUUS tower not the Marina. From what I gathered the Equus tower is the renovated rooms that resemble the pics online. Beds were very comfy with great pillows. Room was quiet, could not here the traffic outside. Bathroom is a bit small, but always had hot water. A bit of a small TV, but you are in Hawaii you shouldn't be watching too much TV anyways. The AC is a very quiet one and kept our room nice and cool. There was a coffee maker and small mini fridge and freezer. It wasn't on when we checked in, but just changed the dial to the highest setting (careful, on the highest setting it will freeze whatever is in the fridge). Ironing board, iron and hair dryer in the bathroom closet. NO WI-FI in room, it is a cable but its free, and it worked just fine, it was fast and reliable. There is WI-FI in the lobby and the front desk can give you the log on info.Continental Breakfast in the lobby. I am not a fan of continental breakfasts period, no matter where I have stayed. It consists of coffee, OJ, toast, rolls, muffins and fruit. But Mc Donalds is a block away, and IHOP (over priced) is 2 blocks away and a bit further is Wailana Coffee house (great breakfast reasonable price)The staff was great, very helpful and love to joke around. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. If you do your research and READ everything around you then you won't be surprised. I didn't walk in there expecting the Four Seasons.

The hotel offers oceanside horseback rides, and on Sunday they host the coolest bbq on the island, where the local folks go to watch polo, eat good food, drink good drink, and enjoy the beach away from the crowds of Waikiki.","Greenwich, Connecticut","UNCaldwell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greenwich, Connecticut</strong>",1,5.0

After researching for 3 months, I finally made a decision to book the Equus. My main concern was finding a hotel that was clean without breaking the bank. I wasn't looking for a place to be pampered or to get room service. I absolutely found this at the Equus. We had a king size bed that was amazing. After a long day of walking around and exploring, it was always a pleasure to come back to my room. There was plenty of space for my luggage. We had a large flat screen TV, a balcony (not much of a view, but my boyfriend spent every morning out there reading. It was his favorite part of the trip), and a small fridge. My room was cleaned each day. We both felt at ease while in our room. The staff at the front were also extremely helpful. Although the Equus cannot book tour reservations, I found that the staff was always extremely helpful whenever I asked a question- and if they didn't know, they would find the answer for me. ""What bus do I take? What time is the bus? How do I book a luau? Where is this restaurant?"". You can also check out towels to take to the pool or beach.The Equus does have a pool and jacuzzi, but you do have to walk outside to the street and around the building to get to it. There are also some tennis courts. In the morning, I had no problem getting sun (other than it seemed to rain each day while I was in Hawaii). Only problem is that the hotel is right on Ala Moana and the traffic doesn't seem to die down even at night. There were nights that I had troubles sleeping, but I would blame that more on the 6 hour time change and my boyfriend's snoring more so than the noise from the street. The AC on low was usually enough to help drown it out.Tip: There is a parking garage behind the Outback where you can park a car for a 10 hour max for $6. We rented a car one day and parked it there overnight.","Boston, Massachusetts","jbk871</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",1,4.0

The Equus is right on the bus route or just a 15 min. walk. Personally, I like to relax with a nice stroll on the beach with many entrances to take me to the main road.  Dislikes? Well if I were rich and could afford to spend tons of money on a view that I look at a few minutes at night before I go to sleep and a few minutes before I go there, then I wish it was right on the beach like at those Main Premium Hotels.  This is a ""short"" review of all the great things I could say about staying at ""The Equus""  So WHY wouldn't you stay there?

We have stayed at the Hyatt, Prince Resort Waikiki, Executive Centre, and several guest houses in the Kailua/Kaneohe area. My overall favorite is the Prince Resort.For our latest trip we decided to save some money on our hotel. I saw a number of favorable reviews for The Equus and we decided to give it a try. We knew that it was across the street from the Prince, so we were familiar with the area. The Equus met our needs very well.We had a king bedroom that was neatly furnished, had a lanai with a view of Ala Moana Blvd, and a compact but very modern bathroom. The room rate included internet access and a continental breakfast plus coffee in the room. The staff, including Kika and Mimi responded to every request or question that we had. One of the biggest drawbacks is the traffic noise on Ala Moana Blvd, even in the middle of the night. That is the price for the convenient location.There are no views of the water from the main building, but a 5 minute walk brings you to the boardwalk at the Hilton lagoon, which provides access to Waikiki Beach. We also had lunch one day at Hilton Hawaiian Village, and some meals at the Waialana Coffee Shop and had dinner once at Red Lobster. Because our son lives in the downtown area, we had dinner twice at Murphy's, which has a variety of meals at reasonable prices.We used the parking garage at the Marina Tower which is adjacent to The Equus. The only challenge is finding a spot that is not marked ""Reserved"". Sometimes we parked on the second level, other times we were on the fifth level, but we always found a space. We were spoiled the times we stayed at the Prince because of their excellent valet parking, but we paid significantly less to stay at The Equus.We will probably stay at The Equus (or the Marina Tower) on our next trip to Honolulu.","Coupeville, Washington","RichVolk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coupeville, Washington</strong>",21,4.0

We were walking past the Equus at 5 a.m. and on a whim stopped to see if they had a room. Not only did they have a room but the night desk was very friendly and apologetic that they had to charge us for a full night just for a few hours of sleep. Since then our first choice... for planned and unplanned stays! is the Equus. The staff is friendly and the rooms are very clean. Rooms with balconies are the best. The beds though are the icing on the cake. They are soooo comfortable! Very nice after a night on the town and all you want to do is sleep it off. Makes it hard to check out though.

One doesn't go to Waikiki for peace and quiet, complimentary breakfasts, or to hang out in a hotel room. One would go to a resort outside of the city for these. The Equus is an immaculate, tasteful, low budget, aesthetically pleasing boutique hotel that screams: location, location, location. There was no view to speak of, but we weren't there for a view. We were there to access to all of the amenities of the other hotels in town, including the best beaches, restaurants, and shopping.

I asked the girl working down there how long does breakfast go on to and she said 9:00am.

The Equus is right on Ala Moana Boulevard, so there is unavoidable noise at night. But you soon get used to it.

When we asked why the bathroom fan didn't work, the maintenance man came down to tell us there was a grill on the ceiling, but no ducting for it in the wall.

During our four night stay there, our room was cleaned once, despite our multiple requests. This wouldn't be so bad if there was some sort of environmentally-friendly policy in place, but as far as we could tell, it was just out of not wanting to do it. Furthermore, the room was still dirty from the last residents, including thick layers of dust under the bed, ketchup stains on the carpet, empty chip bags behind the dresser, and a used kleenex in the coffee machine's reservoir (who ever they were, they must have been real pigs.) We had to request a new coffee machine three times before someone came by to do anything about it. All that being said however, it really is a nice little hotel with a lot going for it. The rooms was largely nice and quiet - something that is apparently rather rare in hoppin' Waikiki. We actually had a lanai, which also seems like a rarity for a economical room. Moreover, the location is great: only a block and half from a major bus stop (and close by several other bus and trolley stops on other routes), two blocks from the beach, and near, but not in the overly pricey and congested heart of Waikiki. Basically, if you don't mind the dust and idiosyncracies, and only plan on using the hotel as a place to lay your weary head, the Equus is a good spot.

We never used the pool and never saw anyone ever in it - it looks nice- but it's located in the wrong area of this hotel where sunlight never really gets to it. Parking slots were always used up by the time we came back from a days or nights outing, so that part sucked, but on the flip side we were able to park in the rear of the hotel, at the sister property, Marina Towers. So that worked out great for us. It's still $18 or $20 a day for parking...bummer.

We stayed in the main Equus building on the 10th floor and not the tower. Positives: 1. Price. For $105 per night, we had a room with a king sized bed, free internet (fast connection), small flat screen television and refrigerator. 2. Location: The location was within walkable distance to the Ala Moana mall. An ABC store was a few steps down from the hotel. 3. Cleaning Crew: Seemed to do a good job of providing good cleaning services. Negatives: 1. We heard loud traffic noise until 1 AM, and again starting around 7 AM. The door to your room is not inside a building, but rather external, so outdoor noise is a problem. 2. The hotel isn't handicapped accessible from the outside and no ramps or elevators are available to help you up to the lobby. From the street level, the lobby is about a 20 stair climb, with your luggage. 3. The rooms were a little rough around the edges. Our room had standing water in the shower drain. It was a little gross; however the drain worked. The walls were worn and some of the details seem rough or unfinished. Our bathroom fan was constantly on (could not be turned off) and was pretty loud. The elevator was very slow. We stayed up on the 10th floor and had to wait a long time to get the elevator to our floor. 4. ""Business Center""- We had to print a single document and though internet is free in the individual rooms, it is a charge service to use the computer with printer downstairs in their lobby. We had to access the internet to print a document and it ended up costing us extra money. It would be nice if little things like this were included for guests.All in all, if you're looking for a place that is a budget hotel in Waikiki, this works for a short stay. You definitely miss out on a lot of the amenities of the larger hotels and resorts but it's also about 80-100 cheaper per night. You can certainly use that extra money in Waikiki. I wouldn't recommend the place for families with small children as the noises might keep the kids up. Most of the people we saw staying here were younger singles and couples without children.","charleston, sc","ajcharleston</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>charleston, sc</strong>",9,3.0

My husband and I were going to be in Honolulu for 4 nights and Equus was excellent for a young couple. We knew we weren't going to be in the room often. The hotel is close enough to ""the strip"" of shops on kalakaua. The staff at Equus were incredibly hospitable, especially Sergia, who'd helped with directions and adviced us on restaurants. We got there early and were disappointed we had to wait for our reserved room. The front desk decided to put us in a room with a better view (23rd floor with an ocean view!) so we could check in right away. The rooms were a good size, very clean if a little used-up looking. Parking was similar to the rest of the hotels ($18/night). The pools and the hot tub were always kept very clean and there wasn't usually anyone there, which I liked.

We stayed in the Equus itself, not the Marina Tower. We had to circle the block 4 times to even figure out which hotel it was, no real signs for it, took forever and the parking lot was full so it was very confusing. You have to park in the little parking lot and walk around the corner and up stairs.Check-in took 3 minutes and the elevator to the fourth floor was very fast. They were also pretty helpful whenever we had a question on how to get someplace, etc. The bed was the most comfortable bed my husband and I had EVER been in. I wish I could have taken the mattress home with me! The room was clean, although the carpets had a few stains in them, but it was no big deal. The website said that it was newly renovated, but I didnt really think it was at all. We loved the trey lighting in the room! It gave it a much more romantic feel. Everything was great, shower was small but that didn't bother us. The King room was very roomy as well!The only complaint I had was houskeeeping would show up anywhere from 8am-1pm. They weren't very organized in that manner and left trash bags and linen bags in the hallways for hours. No wonder we never had towels or pillowcases! Whenever we came back to the hotel, we usually had no hand towels or only one towel and a missing pillowcase. It didn't bother us that much, because we just started stashing the towels after the 2nd night instead of having them take them so we know we would have towels!! Location was great for the most part, a Mcd's and IHOP around the corner. Bus Stop to Waikiki and other major areas across the street from Mcd's. Pretty noisy, but seemed to die down at 12am, although the noise never bothers us. Any hotel in the area would be loud! If you rent a car, parking was $18/day. Expensive, and considering there is only limited parking...I would suggest parking for FREE down the block by the Ala Moana Center, not a long walk, and saves a lot of $!! I wish we would have known that when we got there!Overall, it's a great hotel especially for the price!","Clarksville, Tennessee","dmellenthin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clarksville, Tennessee</strong>",0,4.0

But it honestly needs major renovation before I would consider returning. There were other things that detracted from Equus. First and foremost is the front-desk staff. There were 2 middle-age gentlemen who were not friendly at all. Whenever we approached either of them to ask a question, they wouldn't even take the time to look up from what they were doing, nor would they smile. Seemed to us, they had either been there way too long to care anymore, or just didn't enjoy dealing with guests. Second, after checking in and going up to our room, we discovered a urine-like smell in the bathroom. We thought it might be from the toilet, but that was clean, Then we checked the shower. Turned out the smell was from the shower curtain, which was clearly in need of a good laundering or even replacement. That smell intensified whenever we took a shower and the curtain got wet. Third, the free breakfast that is advertised is a joke-- just coffee, vats of juice, and really awful muffins. After the first day, we drove to the local Safeway to pick up our own breakfast provisions that lasted us during our stay. You can also go down to the ABC store just on the corner, but it's a lot more expensive than stocking up at Safeway or Walmart. There were other housekeeping issues that could be improved upon, such as using fitted sheets on the mattress, and installing more towel racks in the bathroom, and vacuuming the bathroom daily. But again, if these small things don't bother you, and you're looking for a cheap place to stay, then it's adequate. Also, ask for a room not overlooking the street. The room we were in was just above the street, so traffic noise was pretty bad. If you're going to walk to Waikiki, it will take you a good 20 minutes.",San Francisco,"EuripidesSF</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",4,2.0

Unfortunately, this is negated by the noise level. Despite supposedly ""soundproof"" windows, you hear all the street noises - including the construction that starts at 6 AM - even on the top floors. The location of this hotel is just ok. You are near Waikiki beach but outside the nice area where all the shops and restaurants are located. It is about 1.5 miles to walk to central Waikiki beach. This hotel is also not for anyone who has trouble walking or with carrying your luggage. It is not wheelchair accessible. There is a flight of stairs to get in--no elevator (for the first flight). You have to carry your own luggage up the stairs--the hotel does not offer any assistance in this regard.Overall, the service is lacking. The front desk rarely answers the phone, and the people at the front desk tend to be unfriendly and unhelpful (especially the night staff). There is only one elevator and it is slow so it can take a long time to get up and down if you are on a higher floor. Perhaps the most disappointing thing about this hotel is the ""continental breakfast."" The ""breakfast"" consists only of regular coffee (no tea -- and incidentally there is no tea or regular coffee in the rooms either, just decaf coffee) that is so bad it is undrinkable, and rolls that are a cross between a potato roll and a hamburger bun filled with some sweet dough-like substance. If you get to breakfast in the first 15 minutes, you might be able to get a couple pieces of pineapple or watermelon--but this runs out by 7:45 and there is so little of it to begin with that you would be lucky to get any. There are no muffins, croissants, bananas, apples, or basically anything edible.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Lava120</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",0,1.0

The price is reasonable, the location is awesome (walking distance to the beach and Ala Moana Shopping Centre & bus stops), the staff are friendly & helpful - especially Rene, the rooms are clean and tidy - the place has a Balinese feel to it with the dark wood, tiles & marble which I like - it really makes you feel like you're on holiday. Compared to other places I have stayed at in Waikiki, I much prefer the Equus as the rooms are bigger and you get more for your money. I really can't understand the bad reviews on this hotel - I think some people just expect too much but at the end of the day, you're on holiday, hardly in your room anyway, you just need somewhere safe, clean, tidy & comfortable to sleep so the Equus ticks all the boxes for me. We are hoping to return in December and will be happily staying here again.

We booked ours on the top floor (10th) to have quiet from street and it was so very quiet! The room was amazing, pillow top mattress, luxury thread count sheets, flat screen tv, internet (free), mini kitchen with fridge and granite counter. Cool inset lighting around room. I loved this room and the price was awesome! The service was fast and friendly, anytime I needed anything! The only negative I could say would be for their ice machine in the main hotel to be functioning, there was ice in their other hotel, the tower behind this hotel but it was not as handy as in the same building. The staff would run and offer to get the ice for you as well. Also, the elevator was quick! No wait usually. The pool is small and I did not care about that as I planned to spend my time at the beaches of Waikiki, not at a hotel pool.

After much research through TripAdvisor and other sites, we decided to stay at the Equus. First impressions? This is a quant little hotel just off the main Waikiki strip. It's not a flashy hotel screaming ""touris trap"". It's clean, the staff are very friendly (and responsive) and the rooms while not huge are quite nice. One thing people should keep in mind is that when you take into consideration the costs to stay (which is very reasonable), the value is extremely good. It's not on the main strip nor is it a ""resort"" so if you want that night life and conveniences, then this isn't the hotel for you so you need to decide what kind of trip you are looking for. For us, we were going to be spending very little time near the strip but exploring the island so we were more concerned with a comfortable bed and clean ammenties.The hotel comes with a free continental breakfast which is a nice service but expect to be fighting with other guests for food (consists of juices, coffee, fresh fruit and pastries). The breakfast is only served between 8AM and 9AM so if this doesn't work for you, this service won't be for you. One thing of note, if street noises bother you, then ask for an ocean view room so that you're not facing the main road. Our room actually faced the road but in all honesty, we didn't notice the street noise anymore after our second night. Something else you should be aware of at the Equus. It has incredibly comfortable beds, probably the reason why we didn't notice the road noise. If you're renting a car (which isn't a bad idea for Oahu), parking is available for $18/night. The parkade is in an adjacent building which has a metal link garage door so only individuals with a garage opener will be able to get into the facility. When you rent a vehicle, you will have to register the vehicle with Equus's front desk which they will then provide the garage opener for you. Your vehicle will be more than safe here.The Hilton Hawaiian Village is about 2 blocks south west of the Equus as is the beach so you're not very far away. The Hilton is a major pick up point for buses, tour groups and other activities so the proximity comes in handy. It's also a nice spot to relax and there are some nice restaurants there. In the opposite direction of the Equus is the Ala Moana Mall (approximately 10 minute walk) so if you wanted to do some shopping or just need to pick up some ammenties, this is a good resource. Something also nice is that the food court there provides a nice option if you don't want restaurant food.All in all, the Equus was a nice hotel that we would come back to again and have no issues with recommending to anyone else.","Edmonton, Canada","alany72</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",100,4.0

Tucked away off the beaten path enough to not get the noise of the strip but still very close to the excitement, this hotel was wonderful for the town getaway my husband and I were looking for. Even though it was a bit hard to find at first, the feeling of being less conspicuous was nice. As the name implies, Equus has a theme, and for a horse lover like me, I was in heaven staring at the endless pictures of old paniolos (hawaiian cowboys) and horses running on the beach. The rooms were a perfect blend of old hawaiiana memorabilia and pieces of restored antique furniture perfectly blended with the newest amenities. The location was great...I had a view of some Waikiki surf spots from the room and the receptionist told us all the best places to go on a Friday night. We started with happy hour at the Chart House, then to Indian food (we decided to skip the Thai place and save it for next time) which my husband said had the best garlic nan (bread) he's ever eaten. Then off to the Hilton to see the Friday fireworks--a GREAT show--don't miss it if you are in Waikiki on a Friday...and to round table pizza for a little late night munch. The ABC store right below the hotel was fully stocked with everything from food to beach mats (and ice cream!). Needless to say, we had quite a feast that evening and we still have many places to go next time. The hotel looks like it has been recently refurbished: new appliances, countertops, fixtures, tile, furniture, just about anything that isn't restored antique is brand new. The kitchen and living room were my favorites. I could have entertained a small party as the kitchen was fully stocked with all the (new) silverware and accessories I would need. In the living room sat a plush red couch, complete with cozy blanket, that sat right in front of a new flat screen. My husband and I fell asleep and could barely get off the couch to make it to our bed. I would go there just to spend another night on that couch! Parking was also a plus. In many hotels in Waikiki you have to walk forever to get to your car but the parking lot of Equus was conveniently on the ground level and was easy to get in and out of. Overall, I really wish I had more time to check out the rest of the hotel but had to leave the next morning. I give Equus two big thumbs up, it surpassed my expectations.","Haleiwa, Hawaii","surfergirlsiri</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haleiwa, Hawaii</strong>",0,5.0

We have tried other hotels but keep coming back to the familiar excellent service we receive from Rene and all of the team at the Equus ( a big thank you to Puka. Lygaya and Sergia). The combination of small boutique hawaiian hospitality, excellent service It is true that there are steps from the road to the first floor with no elevator but my elderly mother had no problems with them. Also given the economic environment the hotel has removed some of the added value elements it used to provide for free ( like the water bottles on arrival, the manager's drinks party on a tuesday and was during our recent stay only operating a full room service on 6 days of the week).That said they have upgraded the cable service and still offer the best free continental breakfast ( fresh fruit, two juices, coffee and a selection of nice pastries) around. It is now serevd for just an hour 8.00 to 9.00 and can be a bit of a bun fight at busy times). Sergia manages to serenely weave amongst the guests keeping stocks replenished.The rooms are kept very clean and maintenance issues are resolved promptly and effeciently. The staff all work very hard and seem genuinely friendly.Car parking is an issue with all Waikiki hotels and really you should be using the excellent bus service on the island. The hotel is a 1/4 mile from a major bus terminal point at the Ala Moana Shopping Center which has buses all over the island running every 15 mins or so. See the TheBus web site for schedules and maps. If you are staying over 20 days the monthly bus pass is excellent value ( and for over 60's is a steal).There is a small pool but it is better to use the pool at the Aqua Marina next door ( access using your key card).

As other reviewers have noted, its got a great location, it may be hard to find at first, but its a very comfortable place to stay, not a loud and flashy place. There is a refrigerator in the unit, so you can store drinks or food, and there is internet access, but its not wireless. The beds are super comfortable, you can fall right in and fall asleep. Customer service is great as well, but the best, is Rene, the guest services manager. After having a delayed flight into Hawaii, meaning instead of arriving at 330am, i arrived at 11:30am, which was just about the time to check out, I asked Rene if she could give me a later checkout, she gave me the latest checkout she could, which was right when I had to leave for my flight anyways, and it allowed me to get some rest and shower after a long delayed flight. I stay here everytime I have to fly through Hawaii (4-6 times a year), its a great deal, and a great staff).

I even called 2 days in advance of my stay, spoke to the Front Desk confirming my stay. They told me it was confirmed and guaranteed they had me booked in an upper floor. You should also know, as a policy of this hotel, they charge your credit card 3 nights in advance of your first night's stay. Basically, I had paid for a room before I even stepped in the hotel.After travelling for most of the day, I arrived at 10:30 at night only to be told, ""We are overbooked and we are sending you to the other end of Waikiki. Too bad, so sad."" The front desk clerk tells me that if I don't like it, to call the General Manager. So he puts me on the phone with her and she tells me the same thing and to hand the phone back to the clerk. He talks to her for a few minutes and hangs up, looks at me and says, ""We have no room for you. Do you want this other room or not?"" I would not accept the hotel he was giving me until he finally decided to call one of their other properties nearby. He gets me a room, then says to me, ""we are going to honor the same rate we quoted you here to."" Unbeleivable.My friends, this place is messed up. They will throw you out on the street even with a guaranteed reservation. You'd think they'd care enough to call, email, text or even fax me a note saying they couldn't honor the reservation and they wanted to make new accomodations...but no...they wait until you arrive.The funny thing, and the irony of this - the next day they couldn't apologize enough...but at 10:30 at night, no one is around to take care of a guest!

To get in you have to walk up a set of stairs from the main street. There is a really small lobby and one elevator. The outside of the hotel is dated and it looks more like a motel 6 than a boutique hotel.The rooms are nicer than the outside suggests. There is a mini fridge and a coffee maker. There is no wireless internet but the ethernet cable is pretty long. The problems with the room started with bed bugs, a condom wrapper that was left in the room (we found it the third day on a side table next to the bed) and when the cleaning staff stole out beach towels [not hotel towels, they were much bigger and fluffier] right out of our luggage. The luggage was open with the towels on top, but it was in our luggage.The breakfast is a real joke, there is not enough food for the crowd that comes down, they only had poi buns and coffee and juice and when we asked if there was anything else besides the buns (which are essentially purple dinner rolls with no butter, jam etc) they were extremely rude.On out second day my wife woke up with two small bites, by the third day she had lots of bites and after getting them looked at we had BED BUGS! We informed the front desk and were moved to another room. Thankfully the bites stopped.With all the problems we spoke to the manager and asked if they were going to do anything for us to make up for the problems. They said they would look into something but never got back to us. One thing the clerk did do was comp our parking, but refunded the wrong card [we paid parking separate from the room], then two weeks later charged us the same amount they refunded without letting us know. Since we have a Canadian credit card this caused us to pay exchange fees multiple times. I called the hotel when I got my visa bill and they were extremely rude and so I had to call visa and file a dispute as the charge was two weeks after out checkout and was clearly not authorized. Visa made good on the difference, but the hotel did not.I would never stay at this hotel again and recommend it to no one!","Kingston, Canada","sixcolors</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kingston, Canada</strong>",100,2.0

You can also look for street parking around the canal but those are hard to get since we checked in late at 10pm.The bed was very comfy and the rooms were clean. It's a convenient location. You can take the bus or a long walk to Waikiki.I'd stay here again next time!","orange county, ca","piggipiggy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>orange county, ca</strong>",11,4.0

It is away from the ""center"" of Waikiki but that was fine with us. I had no problem with traffic noise at night which seem to be on every review for any hotel in/close to the center of Waikiki. The front desk staff was awesome...no request wasn't met. We changed rooms without any problem (A/C concern), were provided beach towels, local information, late check out provided...then extended even later when we couldn't make that. Just a great staff! The bed was extremely comfortable. I slept great! the shower/bathroom was a little small, but not cramped. There is an ABC store at the other end of the block, several restuarants close by(even more if you count the ones in the Ala Moana Mall...not the food court but the restuarants on the higher levels Morton's Steakhouse, Tanaka, etc.) Breakfast can be had at the 24 hr diner 5 -7 mins away (walk) just down the street; eggs/bacon/all you can eat pancakes for about $6.  Overall, a great value if booked early...less than $70 a night. You won't like this if you want to be in the middle of everything. If you're looking to save money and plan on spending time in other parts of the island anyway, this is a good option. Our time was spent on beaches away from Waikiki and we had good access to the highway from here.

The nightly rate was under $ 100 and the room was clean and cozy. Bed very comfortable, shower/bathroom small but adequate. A/C worked well enough, although we were unable to turn up the ac past a certain point. The hotel is located on a busy street which is quite noisy until about 10pm. It starts up again around 7am, so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. We were up on the 8th fl and could still hear the traffic. The patio overlooked the apartment building next door and it was way too hot to sit outside anyway, so we never used it. The Ala Moana Shopping center is around the corner, about a 10 min walk, if shopping is of interest. The beach at the Hilton Hawaiian Village is about a 10-15 min walk, although crowded and the water seemed pretty dirty while we were there. Prefer Ala Moana Beach park in the other direction, but a further walk. Waikiki is about a 20 min walk from the hotel, we did it a couple of times to have dinner and then took a taxi back. The hotel pool is tiny, no lounge chairs that we saw. Not especially inviting, but ok for a dip if desired. The continental breakfast is a joke, coffee, juice, the same fruit (melon, pineapple) every morning and some unappetizing rolls, a few pastries, and those didn't look so great either. Wouldn't take much to improve with icewater, some butter and jam and a variation of fruit and fresh rolls/toast.The staff was hospitable and pleasant. We didn't use the parking, but did rent a Hertz car at the Hilton for the day and toured the island. There are other car rental agencies in the area as well that might be worth comparing rates to. Took VIP transfer ($20 rd trip), and that worked out well. www.viptrans.com. Overall, the room was clean and adequate size, the bed comfortable the rate was good. If you're looking for a reasonable, clean place and don't care about frills, ocean views, and don't mind walking into Waikiki, this hotel is fine.

About 20 minutes to the major shops and restaurants along Waikiki Beach. -Very comfortable beds (I stay in a hotel 3 nights a week for work and this bed is one of the most comfortable)Cons:-Could be noisy depending on the time of day.

I realize it says continental breakfast, but this one was ludacris. They shouldn't even say they offer breakfast. We went down our first morning and there was coffe, orange juice and one dinner roll. We tried the next morning and they had the same plus two pastries a little fruit.-Parking was $18 a day , but that seems about average for the hotels in that area.-Super small shower.

Having stayed and reviewed Hotel Renew and Coconut, both old Waikiki properties, upgraded and made funky, I had higher than usual expectations for Equus. The hotel was booked by my secretary on order to ""book one of those great Aqua properties."" The price is cheap: about $82/night, all in, including tax. Unfortunately, Acqua misses with Equus - perhaps one old Waikiki property too horrible to restore. No matter how many granite countertops are installed in the decently renovated rooms, the sound of garbage truck safety beep beep beeping and the crashing sounds of dumpsters at 0800 is too much. The sound was startling from our 7th floor room. Road noise from Ala Moana Drive can be loud at times as well as cars race down the wide thoroughfare through the night. The lobby is very small and can only be reached by climbing a flight of stairs to the 2nd floor - if you can't manage your bags up a flight of stairs, you'll be challenged. The first floor is taken up mostly by the small parking lot and, bizarrely, the hotel towel washing machine. Rooms are clean and efficient. That says a lot. Many peer properties are not as clean as the Equus. The bed is comfortable, and a smallish flat screen TV is installed. One small beef: despite placing Japanese language shopping ad flyers in the room, the two Japanese language channels are disabled (We are native Japanese). A little on the cheap side, considering Waikiki is normally awash in Japanese tourists.The hotel has a small pool, a nice amenity considering the price. However, its very small and located in a perpetual shadow between two buildings. Not very inviting. Location is ok, about a 15 minute walk to Beachwalk and 15 minutes to Ala Moana shopping center. An ABC store, McDonalds, and Starbucks is located nearby. A few homeless people are hanging out in the area.Shockingly, the hotel is NOT equipped with wireless internet. The other Acqua properties I have stayed at in the past have had a very robust web of wireless internet for free. Considering the price, I can understand why there may be no internet in the rooms, but lobby would be appreciated. The front desk sent me to the Starkbucks, where I found a weak connection for the cost of a latte. Inconvenient. The hotel is decked out with funky Hawaiian cowboy (paniolo) photos in the hallways and rooms. I give credit for trying to squeeze a little design sense into this tired property. The unexplained Bishop Museum copyright warnings on the title plates are a little weird. There is only one elevator, a little creaky and slow. Waiting time not too bad.One minor rant - we had a hard time pronouncing the hotel name suitably for cab drivers to understand. Eventually they understood after spelling the hotel name out.To sum, the price is cheap, but the hotel is iffy. Hanging a few panilo photos and installing granite counters all over the place does not create a ""boutique"" hotel. Perhaps I could suggest to Aqua the name of the property be changed to ""The Equus - an Aqua BUDGET hotel."" That would better meet expectations and accurately describe the property. And then I wouldn't complain. For price sensitive travelers this hotel could be acceptable, with the caveat that street noise will be an issue.","Tokyo, Japan","yamanote</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",466,2.0

Comfortable beds (lots of pillows) and antique furniture that I'm suspecting comes from Indonesia or some such place. One modern feature is the quietest air conditioning I've ever encountered.

Having lived in a hotel for a year with work, I like nice hotels and I didn't expect this to be a great hotel but it was and great value for money. I paid for a part city view but upgraged to a King Room on the 9th Floor (907) for $10 a night and it was so worth it. I know other visitors have mentioned the noise, and it is on Ala Moana Blvd, so yes it's noisy but if like me you carry earplugs there's no problems. The room was spacious, nice furniture, lovely comfortable bed, great sized flat screen TV, and a nice bathroom. The nice large fridge allows you to stash whatever you need in terms of drinks and food and there is a microwave at the back of reception if you need it.Breakfast was basic but thats fine, the fruit was lovely and free, so can't beat free. The staff were really friendly and arranged for my hotel pick up which at only $10 is also a bargain.The pool isn't really usable as its down the side of reception but use the lagoon or the beach at the hilton village, the Equus even give you beach towels so you dont need to stuff them into your suitcase.The only thing I didnt like was the balcony outside the room wasnt really usable firstly as there wasnt really view and it was noisy, but there were live in pigeons so it was covered in poo.... but as I only used it to dry a towel it didnt affect my stay.",ware,"rosielatethirties</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>ware</strong>",15,5.0

The location was awful, unless you're in Hawaii to shop at a large mall - we weren't. All the rooms are outdoor access and the hotel is on a very noisy street - felt like we were in London. Sure there's a bus for $2 to Waikiki, but if you wanted to walk about and feel like you were in Hawaii, this was not the location!The pictures on the Web show something entirely different than what we experienced. The exterior picture is that of the neighboring facility. In reality, you could miss this hotel if you weren't looking intently. Getting into the hotel is an issue, up a flight of stairs with your luggage, and the elevator to the rooms is an embarrassment - further the one small elevator is also used by the cleaning and maintenance staff all day long...good luck getting on with two cleaning carts or the carpet cleaning man with his equipment.According to other reviews written, it's like we must have stepped into the only room that wasn't recently renovated. It looked nothing like the pictures posted. The furniture was supposed to look ""island"" like, but it looked old and stained. The staff was horrendous - we never met any of the friendly staff that others have spoken about. The ""pool"" was horrible, unless you walked through the parking garage to use the neighboring pool.The ""breakfast"" was nothing but a dinner roll and juice. We did go down very early one morning and found there was also a limited amount of fresh fruit and pastry. We arrived at the time it was supposed to be open and felt like we were imposing on the woman who was setting it up.

Searched around for a decent, budget hotel, thought the Equus sounded interesting, and booked on Orbitz.This is NOT a ""Boutique Hotel"". They claims all types of extra amenities and services that simply do not exist. Yes, the rooms and furnishings have been updated, but it should be compared to a Ramada or Comfort Inn. At the prices charged, you should be able to do MUCH BETTER, or save a few bucks and stay at a budget motel.Examples: There is NO WIFI. The front desk clerk will send you to the pool area, in an attempt to find an open connection (from a neighbor). If unsuccessful, they will send you down the street to Starbucks. All of their promotional materials and even check-in documents claim extras like 24 hour coffee and teas in the lobby - no longer available.The pool is also a joke - situated in a narrow opening between two buildings, so there is no sun - or even furniture to lay down. Hope you don't mind stairs - there is no elevator service from the lobby to the street level / parking - a lawsuit in the waiting (handicap access) - good thing Carlos is there to help with luggage. The only rest room on the main floor is in their ""hospitality room"" - where the sink is used to prepare breakfast; I went to wash my hands after using the rest room, and there were coffee pot components there.BTW: The pictures shown on the Orbitz web site are of a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PROPERTY.Upon returning home, we filed a complaint with Orbitz, who did not seem to care. After waiting 2 weeks, we were given a $25 code for use wuthin the next 12 months.Despite what others have claimed, there is a VERY nice beach in walking distance - Ala Moana Regional Park, just across from the mall.

We stayed at the Equus after having it recommended by Expedia at the last minute. We originally had booked in another hotel closer to the beach that refused to accomodate what we paid for with Expedia - so we transferred.The Equus is a quaint smaller hotel of approx. 100 rooms. There is no ocean view but possibly a marina view from some of the higher floors in the front corner room. The front desk staff is very friendly and helpful and were able to answer any questions we had.The room was VERY CLEAN and comfortable. We had a queen bed in a canopy made of bamboo which was very cool and just what you would expect for Hawaii. The room had a great refrigerator/freezer combo and granite countertop in both the room and bathroom. No tub but stand up shower made of tumbled granite which was fine for us. The bed was very comfortable and sliding doors lead to a lanai with city views. We also had a terrific flat screen TV in our room on the wall. So much better than other hotels with the old TV nailed to the bureau.The hotel also has free internet right through the TV with a wireless keyboard and mouse right in the room, which is fantastic. A very cool bonus and completely handy. For those who need something printed they have a complete setup in the lobby at .20 cents a min. + .35 print per page, but it is well worth the convenience. We loved being able to check email, check bus routes on thebus.org before we headed out for the day. This is a fabulous perk to staying with the Equus.Additionally, the hotel offers a nice continental breakfast each morning of coffee, orange or guava juice, fruit cocktail, fresh whole fruit and a variety of rolls, muffins, etc. Very nice and great touch.The downsides to staying at this hotel first is the location. While it is very convenient to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and bus routes, the only beach option is to cut across the Hilton Hawaiian Village and use that beach or take the bus down to Waikiki. If you were to walk to the Waikiki beach it would take 20-30 minutes. We did it but were hot by the time we got there. We ultimately used the Hilton beach most days. Also, the street noise is very loud. We did not get a good nights sleep any of the nights because of the noise from the street. There is little the hotel can do for this so take ear plugs unless you are used to city noise. There are no laundry facilities at this hotel, they recommend you walk to the Aqua Condo building behind the hotel and go to their 3rd floor coin operated laundry, however when we did this there were 3 people waiting there for their laundry and were using the 2 working machines. So we hauled our laundry down the street to a laundromat. The elevator in this hotel is handy, however we had serious rain on our trip and it seems the elevator goes out of service in heavy rain. This made it necessary for us to walk up to our room and counting the flight of stairs to the lobby then up to our 7th floor room it was a bit of a pain. This would have presented a major problem for anyone with an infirmity or major handicap.Finally, the pool. The pool is very well maintained but small with a heavy rush of moving water in the middle. I never once saw anyone in it. It is bordered on all sides by buildings and is not inviting. Pretty to look at but not functional, as a matter of fact I didn't notice if it had stairs, however I didn't go close to look.I would recommend the Equus for a clean nice place to stay, but if you are looking to spend every day at the beach with little effort you would be better off paying a bit more to stay closer. If you are on business this is perfect since you are close to the Convention Center, Ala Moana and the free internet in the room.Overall we enjoyed our stay at the Equus and the benefits far outweigh the downsides. Compared to the hotel we were initially booked in it was light years better. It is everything a boutique hotel should be.",Connecticut,"wbm97</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Connecticut</strong>",14,4.0

Of the three, the Waikiki Wave was the best, but this hotel definitely had its merits. It's located on the northernmost end of Waikiki beach, across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Even our 3-year-old had no trouble walking along Ala Moana Blvd. to cut through the Hilton Hawaiian Village to get to Waikiki Beach. Ala Moana Beach Park is also within walking distance.Two of the main reasons we chose this hotel were for in-room internet access and parking. For a $65 deposit, the hotel provides a router for reliable high speed internet access at no charge. As for parking, it's true that you have to park in the parking structure of the hotel behind the Equus (the Aqua Marina), but it has a remote controlled security gate and unlimited in and out privileges. (You don't have to wait for your car or tip a valet every time you leave the hotel.)The free continental breakfast isn't worth staying for. Instead, venture down Ala Moana Blvd. to the Wailana Coffee House for a really great breakfast. (It's a favorite among locals and tourists.)When entering the hotel, you do have to walk up one flight of stairs before reaching the elevator, which some may find very inconvenient.The rooms are small, but comfortable and clean. The air conditioning works great and is virtually silent! We did not have a balcony, but some rooms do. Our room had a shower, but no bathtub. In addition to the bathroom sink, there was a bar with a sink, a coffee maker and a small refrigerator. One word of warning -- the two ""double"" beds in our room were quite small, but that's typical of hotel beds in Hawaii.If you MapQuest directions from the airport to The Equus before you arrive, you'll have no trouble finding the hotel.

A flight of stairs up from street level. At the top of the stairs is a small lobby area with reception and a lounge area with one computer terminal plus some chairs and lounges. This is where they serve breakfast in the mornings. Yes, as reported here, there is only one elevator and it is a bit slow.Our room was 902. Not much of a view. We don’t think any of the rooms would have much of a view.BUT, the room was comfortable, huge comfy bed, large Philips flat screen TV which also had a computer attached to it with a full keyboard and wireless mouse. However, problems with Internet connection. Also, could not get a connection with our laptop. They were having problems with the system and to mangements credit, they arranged to have one of the rooms at their sister property next door opened up for Internet use.There was a small balcony with a table and two chairs. Large sliding louvre shutters. Which was just as well because of the high rise just across the way!Large bathroom, coffee making facilities, drip style with fresh coffee which we didn’t use.One advantage for shoppers - it's just a short 10 minute walk to the All Moana shopping centre. However, the walk to Waikiki is something else! - at a leisurely stroll, about 1 hour.The bed was as M sez - “fabulous”.Big screen TV had 32 channels. But a lot of news type networks. All with USA news.A lot of sirens during the night but too tried to worry about after flying in from Australia the previous day.The breakie in the lobby was so-so. Breakie consists of two juices (orange but watery - didn’t try the other one). Coffee with whitener (doncha hate that!). Fruit, great bananas. Then some pastries like little croissants, Danish. Just so-so. Noticed some of the guests went down to Starbucks.Summing up the location of The Equus: Fine for the Ala Moana but a little too far away for the Waikii Beach area. We thought about it, and did change the last two nights to another hotel when we returned 5 weeks later on our way back home.","Wollongong, Australia","Quest803662</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wollongong, Australia</strong>",237,4.0

This is a clean budget hotel. The hotel was clean, the rooms were clean and newly renovated. The rooms were cleaned daily and there was a fridge in the room as well as clean showers. Surprisingly the hotel also had a mini pool but on the downside it closes at 7pm. Upon check in we got two free bottles of water which was a nice touch. This hotel is hard to find and it is far from the beach so you can't get to the beach by walking. I was tossing between staying at this hotel or a different AQUA property which seemed to be closer to the beach (few blocks away).However, this hotel offers a free breakfast so the wife decided to stay here. It was the same price as the other AQUA property. So we decided to stay here but the breakfast was definitely not worth it. They just have a few danishes and muffins, some fruits and that's just about it. Oh yes, they also have some free juices. It also gets pretty crowded in the morning so there isn't much room to eat your very basic free breakfast and there are no tables to eat your breakfast on, just some chairs. If you're choosing to stay here for the free breakfast I think you will be dissapointed.I regret choosing this Aqua property over the other one. Because we had no intention to go to Waikiki beach for a swim (we did that when we stayed at another property on another leg of the trip) but instead we planned to go to other parts of the island the location did not bother us too much. Finding the hotel is a challenge and parking the car can also be a challenge as there is very, and I mean very limited parking under the hotel. Instead, you need to park your car next door at Aqua Marine and then walk back to this hotel. The parking charge is $18 per day whether you park next door or in the hotel parking lot. We did try going to Waikiki at night to purchase something and there is nowhere to park for free even though we circled the entire Waikiki 3 or 4 times. Only place to park is at the end of Waikiki near the Zoo. We had no issues at all staying at this hotel but because of its location I think next time we would go for another hotel closer to Waikiki but would definitely stay here if we had no choice as this was a very clean hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","Appreci8life</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",228,5.0

We got it! We researched the Equus online and liked what we had seen, initially. After easily booking the hotel thru the Aqua Resorts website, we did more online research. The comments we found were NOT very good. Alot of highly negative comments. Alot of complaining about the location. Alot of dissatisfaction with the the facilities. Alot of whining about parking. Alot of moaning and groaning about no food in the area. We almost cancelled the entire reservation due to all of these negative reviews. However, once we got there we found the complaints were 100% wrong. This hotel is great! We had room 1008, a Polo Executive Suite and it was exactly like the website picture depicted. The room was on the 10th floor, at the end of the hall, completely away from the street. Little to no street noise was heard. It didn't have a balcony, but we didn't need one. The view was great, the King bed was comfortable, and the internet was fast. No wireless, but Paulo at the desk lent me a cable to direct connect it to my laptop. The shower is a 1-person one, but that's all we needed. Our only 2 issues with the entire stay was that the deadbolt on our door jammed, but was promptly fixed. And the right railing on the stairs leading to the lobby was loose. Otherwise this hotel was more than great. I guess alot of other reviews were prior to and during the remodeling, but our stay was nothing like those. There's an Outback steakhouse, Red Lobster, McDonalds, Starbucks, a British pub, and an ABS Convenience store within a block. This place is well worth the money. The staff were PLEASANT and HELPFUL! ;) IF you are planning on a 'visit', the front desk staff is wonderful! Renee, Paulo and Puka were friendly and accommodating!

My usual stay is at the Aqua Palms and Spa. They seemed to be relatively full during my trips, thus tried the Equus hotel because it's still in the category of their ""boutique"" line. My first stay there was very impressive. Don't let the exterior fool you. The company invested a lot of money to renovate the hotel. The interior was well designed, moderately contemporary with what they were challenged with. I am in love with the comfort of the bed! THE BED IS WONDERFUL!Anyway, since then, I've stayed at the Equus about five times, just on November 21, as a matter of fact. Unfortunately, each stay encountered some problems... I'll explain my most recent trip. 1. During my online reservation, I requested that there be extra bath towels. No extras were left. I needed to request from housekeeping.2. Upon check-in, person said that he'll ""upgrade"" me to a king bed (I booked two doubles). It didn't matter to me, I was by myself. Not sure if it's considered an upgrade, my opinion, no.3. Entering the room, it seemed half done. Everything seems to be ok, however the extra pillows that are usually propped up nicely, were just thrown on the bed. Not sure if housekeeping forgot to finish... I also walked on a wrapper that stuck to my shoes. - Strike 1.Reported room to front desk. Didn't seem to have believed me. Not sure why I'd lie. He assigned me another room.4. This room didn't have extra towels (item #1), shampoo was missing, although hair conditioner and lotion was there. - Strike 2.5. When walking to the shower (carpet to ceramic tile), I almost slipped because either the carpet was a little damp or the tiles were damp enough to have made me lose my footing. 7. When I was ready to sleep, I noticed an unusual smell, something like detergent or possibly carpet shampoo. That smell seemed to get stronger as the hours passed. I needed to open the patio door to vent the smell. Strike 3.I reported it to both houskeeping and front desk, but fell on deaf ears.My experience with the Aqua Resorts are good - overall. What bugs me the most? DO THEY READ THE COMMENT CARDS? I've always left comments, yes, good and constructive criticism type, but never got an e-mail back...

I got a super great deal on Travelocity and came expecting a really budget hotel. Luckily this hotel worked out great for me. It was so close to the convention center, the mall and Ala Moana park which was awesome to jog around. The king sized bed was comfortable and the flat screen tv was nice. The bathroom size was a little annoying for me being a girl that likes to spread out. Way too small to blow dry your hair without melting but luckily there were mirrors and outlets convenient for drying your hair in the main room. Also the shower is teeny tiny and trying to shave my legs in there was comical. A tub would have been really nice to have, but again I can't complain considering what I paid. The room is probably best for no more than 1-2 people. (Probably not big enough for 2 girls considering the bathroom situation).The staff was really friendly. The pool was kinda unusable except for maybe a quick dip as it was always in the shade and pretty small. I noticed they kept a loud jet on in the pool at all times that I could hear from inside my room. I think they used it to cover some of the street noise which was considerable. There was all sorts of construction going on and busses and delivery trucks going by. I just shut my sliding doors at night. The only other thing that the room was dark as you couldn't keep the sliding shutters open without everyone in the apartments directly across the way being able to see in.

There front desk area is clean and not filled with promotional propaganda...the front desk has zero items on the counter....A touch of class you usually see in really expensive hotels..... someone clearly cares about the details which make a place special.They have achieved a lovely boutique property look with rooms; which are fresh and have a Ralph Lauren look.Not sure they have handicap access...they do have a rare tennis court in Waikiki...no valet parking. No restaurants exceot for breakfast service A little hidden away....but worth findingSome number of years ago, the travel industry called good and bad customer letters ""orchid"" and ""onion"" letters. Well, this is an orchid letter. It is one of the rare, favorable commentaries on hotel service in the world today. For some time, have believed that old-fashioned hard work and professionalism as well as the standards and criteria that make Hotel Industry great have long since either disappeared or perhaps gone overseas to the Far East. Clearly this is not the case with HOTEL EQUUS Honolulu, Hawaii. and their get things done attitude. The staff is well trained and of whom all a hotel industry people should use for an example.

There was a flat screen TV with HD inputs as well as a wireless modem that was given to me for effortless internet access. The room looks just like the photos say (small but functional), but the ""city view"" is nothing more than looking at the balconies of a neighboring hotel. No problem there because a hotel room is meant only for sleeping anyway. The building does seem old, but the room I was in felt updated and had no issues as far as peeling paint/bad odors. The bathroom was small but once again, felt recently updated. The lanai could've gotten a quick wipe down of the table out there/sweep up during the maid service, but other than that the room was spotless. The room I stayed in had no microwave and there was only one ice maker in the property, in a vending area behind the check in desk. There was a microwave there as well which leads me to believe that this is a common microwave/ice maker for the entire hotel. The location was perfect for me, about 2 blocks away from Ala Moana mall, Ala Wai park/beach, and there is an ABC store on the corner for quick snacks, drinks, etc. I felt somewhat at ease walking around the area at night because of other tourists on the street (Ala Moana Blvd.) and this hotel is within walking distance of all the shopping and restaurants of Waikiki. The weekend I was there was pretty quiet, but noise from the boulevard below can and does get into the room easily, probably due to the fact that the only thing between you and outside is a big glass door (for the lanai). If you're a really light sleeper, I'd recommend ear plugs. Overall, I would recommend this property for single travelers or a husband and wife due to the size of the King room. I would definitely come back here, given the ridiculously low price I paid (less than $150) for two nights.","Chicago, IL","stonyisland</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, IL</strong>",1,4.0

Continental breakfast started a little late for our tastes but compared to most continental breakfasts served, this one was pretty respectable.

I must admit that for what I paid for the room each night, I got what I paid for. Firstly, the rooms displayed on the Equus' website are not what I got. A few pictures of polo players and horses does not make it Ralph Lauren inspired. The furniture was outdated and some needed repair. A corner chip on the right side night stand snagged a pair of trousers I was wearing. The bed was king-sized and clean. The door leading to the lanai was difficult to open; I had to use some force to open and close it. The bathroom, although small, was clean but I did encounter a few ""crawling creatures"" during my stay. The shower stall left very little room for movement and I couldn't adjust the showerhead to adequately allow water to fall upon me. There is one small elevator at the site and it takes an extremely long time to rise. Most of the time I took the stairs instead of waiting for the elevator. For those of us without a laptop, there is computer access in the lobby however, it will cost you .15 cents per minute (pre-paid with cash or credit card). The free continental breakfast consists of tasty muffins and pastries, fruits, juices and coffee. To compensate take a walk a block from the hotel to the ABC Store where you can find reasonably priced food items, souvenirs, and a variety of drinks and spirits. The staff at the Equus is quite friendly and accommodating. The location was perfect for my needs. Everything could be found within a 2 to 3 block range. Although it rained everyday during my stay, I still ventured down the street to Ala Moana Park and to the Ala Moana Marketplace. This was my first visit to Hawaii and would I stay at the Equus again? Yes, but I don't believe it would be my first choice.","Garner, North Carolina","flyboyae</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Garner, North Carolina</strong>",2,2.0

We needed a place to stay in Honolulu/Waikiki area and didn't want to pay a ton because we were literally only going to sleep there. We didn't need massive amounts of amenities, just a safe, clean and comfortable place to stay. The Equus was a perfect fit for us. It had a reasonable rate, was easy to find, parking was $18 in a secured garaged parking lot, the check in process was quick, the elevator was slow (but not rickety as some previous reviewers have suggested) and our room on the 6th floor was very nice. I guess we were high up enough as the noise did not bother us and we even could see a portion of the ocean off in the distance. The room seemed small (probably because the bed was so large - it was a king) but clean, the bathroom fixtures were all new, there was a fridge, coffee maker and a flat screen tv. It was about a 15 minute walk through Fort Derussy to the heart of Waikiki beach. We walked over to get some dinner and felt the walk was easy and safe. We did not stick around for the continental breakfast in the morning because we had to catch a flight so I cannot comment on it. Overall we were very pleased with the Equus and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a short stay, no frills hotel in the Waikiki area.","Boston, Massachusetts","jams33</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",16,4.0

If not stay here. Total refurbishment since my last stay very nice. Yes the trim on the elevator needs attention, but I believe the mechanicals had been totally rebuilt recently, prior visit it was clean but decidely run down . Now very clean room, quality linens new furniture and rebuilt baths, all tastefully done. This is a smaller hotel with ltd services, but location is ideal, five minutes from the beach and ten from Ala Moana Centre. The road noise is there, but in all fairness to the hotel there was a repaving project going on during the last week in Sep. The noise did subside after midnight. I suspect many other Waikiki hotels are equally noisy. If you want total quiet go stay at a resort out of town, Waikiki is in the middle of Honolulu folks. I paid 1/3 the going rate of a room at the Hilton Hawaiin village and pocketed the difference, as all I wanted was a clean bed. ABC store just up the steet (a Hawaiian 711) and Outback and Red Lobster are right across the street. Many other restaurants and bars in local area. Breakfast was continental, coffee, fruit and pastries, if you want more, stay elsewhere or pay for a full hot breakfast, it was not a big deal with me as I do not eat much breakfast as a rule. Very cooperative front desk staff unlike prior stay so that is a big improvement as well. An internet connection would have been appreciated, a computer is in the lobby but too pricey to use very long.","Edmonton, Canada","a78jumper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",26,4.0

I wanted to find a reasonably-priced hotel for myself and a coworker in Honolulu, near the beach. I found the Aqua website, and chose the Equus to work best for us, after considering price, location, amenities, and appearance.  We had booked a special online price, and got a great rate ($100 average per night). We checked in late on a Saturday night. We were given our keys quickly, and given directions to park in another Aqua hotel next door. The lobby area was modest, and small, but nice-looking.  My room was on the 8th floor (9 floors total), and I had a king room with private lanai. The room was on the smaller side, but had a very comfortable bed with great linens, a large flat screen tv, rustic wood furniture (I'd love to have it in my house!), and it was decorated in a paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy) theme. My room had a microwave and refrigerator. It would be perfect for 1-2 people, but not more than 2 people.  The bathroom was good sized, with a tile shower, granite counter, and awesome-smelling shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and soap, which were replenished every day.  Every morning, my coworker and I ate breakfast, and the clerk at the front desk was very accomodating to us...we left the hotel before breakfast was served, but I was allowed to collect a bag of pastries and fresh fruit each morning.  The hotel was about a 5 minute walk (maybe 3-4 blocks) from the beach, which I considered reasonable. There was a pool in the hotel, but I didn't use it, and didn't see it in use the whole 2 weeks I was there, but it looked clean.  The hotel doesn't have extras like a restaurant, exercise room, or spa, but everything I could have needed was within a reasonable walk. It was within walking distance to many restaurants and the Ala Moana shopping center.  The only negative thing I can think of about this hotel is that because it is an ""open air hotel,"" meaning the entrances to the doors are on the outside of the hotel, there is a railing over a wall outside the room entrance doors. This wall was a little too low for my comfort (I'm 5'6"")....and it was a long way down. Families with children might be nervous around this wall, but it also may not be a problem for most people. The hotel is also on Ala Moana drive, a busy street, and the street noise can be heard through the lanai doors, but after the first night, I got used to it, and actually enjoyed the noise.  I would definitely stay at this hotel again, and I'd also like to try some of the other Aqua hotels.","San Antonio, TX","Hen7975</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, TX</strong>",16,5.0

I had friends staying at the Westin Moana Surfrider and the walk to their hotel was very pleasant, only took about 15 minutes, and I was in the center of Waikiki beach.

We stayed for 10 days so we needed someplace under $100. At $90 a night, we were surprised to see how nice the entry and decor was (although after climbing the 10 or 12 steps to get up to the lobby numerous times a day we were a little annoyed) and enjoyed how clean the room was. But the parking was HORRIBLE. If you have children do NOT stay here. You have to go down the elevator, down the flight of stairs that they have no elevator for, walk around the corner, through a parking lot, take another elevator into the parking garage, and THEN you can load all your stuff into your car. It seriously took us 20 minutes to leave or return each time. Then each night, at exactly 3:20, the air conditioner beeped about 7 or 8 times. Each time I reported it to the front desk, they said they would ""check on it"". Everytime I asked about whether or not it had been fixed, they said they didn't know. Hmmm...If you can't keep track of what's fixed and what hasn't been fixed, what is the point of customers asking for something to be fixed? Just a waste of time. My 18 month old son woke up everytime it beeped and screamed for a few minutes. THEN...to top it off, I walked in while the cleaning people were there, just to grab something. The woman was wiping our cups out with a white washcloth! (I take it that it was one of ours, since I doubt that most cleaning companies use white hotel towels to clean rooms). After watching numerous dateline nbc-type specials on how hotels don't actually wash your cups anymore, I had told my husband not to use them. He thought I was just being paranoid. Hmmmm... After they left, I smelled both wine glasses (one we had eaten ice cream out of and the other we hadn't used.) One glass smelled faintly sweet with a slightly chemical odor, and the other smelled like nothing. The internet also didn't work (which was a huge disappointment since my husband needed to work from the hotel while we were gone for the surgery) and the parking was almost $20 a night (which made our $90 hotel room not so cheap after all). Basically, if you like climbing stairs, don't have young children or much luggage, and don't mind dirty glasses or not getting a straight answer about simple questions like when the internet is going to be working (we basically got the response of...""It's not working"" to our question of ""When will the internet be working?""), then it's worth staying here. After all, if you'll be at the beach all day, you may not notice these things when you come back. So for that, it is worth the price. But $17 parking when you could valet park at another hotel for $20? I would definitely pay more to stay in a hotel that has more amenities than save a few bucks and get a headache in return.","kapaa, HI","teamkimball</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>kapaa, HI</strong>",27,2.0

Everyone is extremely helpful. In particular, I've gotten to know Puka who works the morning and afternoon shift. This guy is a real gem - he is so helpful and kind whenever I stay at the hotel. Last month, their Internet crashed. These folks did everything they could to make sure internet was available for any guest at the Marina next door. The rooms are outstanding. A/C, Internet, bathrooms and showers are super. And they did a great job when they upgraded their beds. You cannot beat it for the price and location in my book.Yes, there are a few negatives. The elevator is really slow - my advice - don't sweat it - you are in Hawaii! Don't think you'll get a meal with the breakfast, if you need something substantial, go down the street to ABC, McDonald's or Starbucks. And there is no pool...it's not big enough to stick your big toe in it. Pakring is next door at the Marina as they have a small 10 space lot.To me, these 'negatives' are really insignficant when you get a great room with a great staff who really works at making your stay enjoyable. If you need all of the glitz with a big hotel, don't stay here. But, if you just need a place to sleep and be in a central location, the Equus is it.I won't consider staying at any other hotel when I am in Oahu.

How fun!), SS fridge/freezer, and a coffee maker. It has the feel of an adolescent timeshare condo with more than the usual hotel room. The only possible negative observation worth stating is that if you are claustrophobic or tend toward XXL sizes, you may want to also inquire about larger rooms since the bathrooms, showers and general room space is on the tight side. Personally I liked it that way but for some it may be a drawbackThere was a light breakfast of pastries, coffee, fruit and fruit juices in the lobby, a small pool and an ice machine.

What finally became the deciding factors were the price and pictures of the refurbished rooms. With 6 of us traveling I wanted the most affordable rooms with the greatest comfort. I am pleased to say that we were extremely delighted at the results. For the most part what I have read in others reviews are pretty accurate, but I'd like to break it down.The rooms are redone (look just like the pictures), about standard size and are clean. The beds are very comfortable with great pillows and comforters. The bathrooms only have a shower but have nice tile work and the pressure wasn't bad (I could actually get the shampoo out of my long hair) . The toilets are really loud when they flush but they do flush, so that's a good thing. There is a small safe in the closet in the bathroom and also a laundry basket (this was nice to have to put dirty clothes in it while we were there). Overall, the room was great.There ARE stairs from the street up to the front desk, and more than just a couple but not anything overbearing even with luggage for 6 people. It is true, the elevator is in rehab (although while we were there the floor did get finished, now they just need to finish the door panel and put up the new wall paper), but definately not a reason to cross this hotel of your list of prospects. The breakfast is simple with a small varity but very tasty and fresh. The hotel is on a busy, noisey street (but we were on the 3rd floor and had absolutely no problems with noise with the windows closed), there is free WiFi in the rooms but we had trouble connecting. However it is another company that manages the internet vs. the hotel themselves so they gave us the number and we contacted them and finally got connected. The pool was small and unfortunately people had thrown numerous cigarette butts into it, but wait -the hotel next door is also part of the aqua chain and your room key allows you into their pool which is a little larger, more private (it's behind the tennis courts) and has a jacuzzi as well as and outdoor shower. We went over there (45 second walk) and were completely satisfied. As budget hotels go, this one ranks very high.Finally, the staff was wonderful and very accomodating. We arrived our first night close to midnight after a late flight. When we got to the front desk they greeted me by name like they knew me before I even got a chance to tell them who I was. We checked out the next day because we were flying to another island but were coming back in a week. This time we arrived early before check in and they were able to get us into one of the two rooms early. We stayed the next several days here and all of the staff from the front desk (day or night staff) to the housekeeping department was incredible with a great aloha spirit. On our last day we had a late flight out so we had a late check out and then they stored our bags until it was time to leave for the airport at NO extra cost. They were simply amazing.Couple of ending thoughts for you who haven't made up your mind, if your nit-picky, think hard about it but if you are willing to have the aloha spirit and looking just to have a good time. I wouldn't hesitate. The hotel is not close to Waikiki but you are only about a block away from The Bus line that will take you anywhere for $2.00 per adult $1.00 per student (under 17) . It's diagonal from the ILIKAI hotel and across the street from the Hawaiian Prince hotel. There are a several restraunts close by including Red Lobster, Outback, Subway, McDonalds and Rainbow Sushi. Not to meantion it only being a little over 5 minutes to walk to the 4 story Ala Moana Shopping Center just down the street with one of the best food courts I've seen. (Japanize, Korean, American, Italian, etc....) Departing note-it is as cheap to rent a limo for your airport tranportation as it is to take a taxi. $28.99+tip (total not per person) will take you and up to 5 guests to or from the Equus to the airport. The cab (minivan) is about the same price give or take a couple of bucks due to traffic.

Mainly due to a better beach location then an airport hotel and the online price that was offered. What a big mistake this was!I took an airport shuttle to the location. From reading the previous reviews I was prepared to haul my luggage up the flight of stairs from the street entrance. The street entrance was quite nice with a small side garden patio off to the left of the open-air check in desk. I was allowed to check in a couple hours early, which was very helpful. The first sign that I had made a mistake in this location was the elevator. Yes it was slow but I knew about that from other reviews so I was expecting that. What shocked me was the physical appearance of the elevator. The floor had tiles half taken out, one of the doors had its decorative surface removed, wallpaper was either peeling or in the process of being removed, not quite sure. It appeared as a DIY project gone wrong! As I arrived at my designated floor my first view was a large pile of dirty towels on a bench opposite the elevator (note to self was not to sit on the bench) I preceded to my room. The rooms are not on an inside hallway and the room doors are all accessible from the outside. The outside corridor was somewhat dingy and rundown looking.I entered my room and was thankfully surprised on the nice décor of the room. The bed décor was well appointed and the furniture fit well into the room. The bed was very comfortable and there were lots of pillows, which made the bed comfortable to lie in. Bedding was of good quality. There was a flat screen TV mounted opposite to the bed, which was a nice touch. The room was fairly clean and had no odors. The Aircon worked well with a temperature control that was easy to operate. Unfortunately is all that was good in the room.The sliding glass door out to the patio/lanai was unlocked upon arrival. It also looked like there had been numerous attempts to enter the door with a crowbar or screwdriver. That did not bode well for a single woman traveler. The bathroom was somewhat small, which was not a problem. The sink did not have a stopper in it so it was hard to wash out a few items in the sink. The grout between the tiles was dingy and not well done. I know that the location had undergone a redo…but the work was not done well. The shower was very small and the tile was dingy, which gave the appearance of being unclean and dirty. The front door did not meet the doorjambs leaving a gap of up to a ¼ inch between the door and doorjamb. The closet that was in the bathroom had not been redone like the rest of the room, the interior walls were very old looking and stained which gave the appearance of being dirty. But the main problem with this location was the ROAD NOISE! I had read the reviews about it and took that into consideration. I figured that I was a city girl and a sound sleeper so the road noise would not be a problem, I was very, very wrong. The road noise appeared to amplify between the buildings for most of the night ending about 4am. It was a very long and sleepless night. I would not consider location again due to the how loud the road noise is. One last note, I was told upon check out that the elevator was waiting for permits to be redone and that after several years the permits have been issued.","Seattle, Washington","Seetheworld1800</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",26,1.0

We weren't bothered by the street noise but we aren't overly sensitive to noise. We found Renee at reception to be extremely friendly and accommodating. We checked in at noon and although our room wasn't ready, she found another one that was and gave us all bottled water while we waited. We really appreciated that as we were heading out on a tour right away and needed to store our luggage somewhere. Can't really comment on the pool or breakfast as I didn't make it down for either but we did take advantage of the free internet in the lobby.

However, the only inconvenience caused by the construction was confined to the elevator. The elevator is very old and extremely slow and this was compounded with the use by construction personnel who were working on the top floor (the 10th). Our room was on the 8th floor and I found the stairs to be much faster than using the elevator. At 65 years of age, however, the trip up was only three times and down maybe a dozen times.Our room was very nice and comfortable. The wide-screen television (although it only had analog stations available) was very nice. We didn't watch much television, of course, but it did give us free access to the Internet -- a nice perk, indeed.In addition to the elevator, there are three other negatives that need mention. The elevator does not go to the ground floor so luggage has to be lugged up the stairs to the 2nd floor desk at check-in and back down when you leave. (It is also very confusing as to where to park during the check-in period but eventually one figures it out -- perhaps after several trips around the ten block circle.) Secondly, if you have a car, count on paying $18 a day for garage space. The alternative is to find a parking place on the street. Yeah, right. Lastly, is the noise. This property is on one of the busiest streets in Honolulu and the traffic noise is quite loud and doesn't really diminish in the wee hours. I wear 33db ear plugs at night which blocks out (I thought) all sound. Nevertheless, the sound, for example, of those rental motorcycles, particularly between 2 and 4 a.m., was as if they were in the room with me -- remember, I was on the 8th floor.In any event, we were completely satisfied with our stay at this hotel and would recommend it to anyone willing to accept the above (very minor, actually) negatives.

The armoire, end table and nightstand had multiple chips out of the wood, gouges and scratches. Had our children been toddlers, we could not have stayed in the room due to the risk of splinters. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable but we were disappointed overall with the condition of the room. Given our numerous pieces of luggage and (by check in time) sleeping kids, we did not opt to change rooms. Also, one morning around 8am we requested four beach towels. After checking multiple locations, the front desk told us they only had three clean towels.

The only down side to the Equus were the stairs that you had to lug your luggage up to get from the parkade/street level to the lobby/elevators. The hotel is located at the marina end of the ""strip"" and is a fair distance from wakiki beach. And our room did not have a bathtub.

Excellent rooms and beds, without any ""resort frills"". You won't beat it for comfort, style and cleanliness. However if you require a rotating restuarant, piano-bar, dinner show, spa and full-hot breakfast with your hotel, then the Equus is probably not for you. Other than that it's a great room to unwind and relax for another days activities. For those that insist on negatives.1. The street traffic is noticeable even on the 8th floor.2. You do have to walk to anywhere. ABC store or McDonalds is a 2 minute walk. Red Lobster and Outback Steakhouse are maybe 3 minute walks. Only because you have to wait to cross the street. I guess that's a negative? And the beaches really are a 10-15 minute walk.If all you plan to do is hit the beach this is probably not the place for you. However, if you want 5-star comfort for a 2-star price. Equus is hard to beat.","tulsa, ok","reddrover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>tulsa, ok</strong>",1,5.0

The bed was great with nice bedding (I even liked the faux Hawaiian quilt on the bed!). Everything was clean, especially the bathroom which is what concerned me the most about this ""budget"" hotel...but it was very nice and extremely clean.

For such a great price, we didn't really mind the slow elevator...it does take a few extra minutes but it's not that big of a deal.

The rooms were clean, it was a pretty good location and value for money. Like other posters have said it is not a well-known location so make sure you have the address with you to find it. We just had to walk across the road to another hotel to get the tour buses so it was fine.THE PROS - The staff were friendly - particularly the girl at the front desk whose name I can't remember - and let my sister check in early after she arrived feeling really sick. Also our air-con broke down one day and they fixed it right away. The room was nicely renovated and clean. It had the most comfortable beds and pillows we've ever slept on. The TV had about 40 channels. there's an internet computer in the lobby that just cost a few dollars to use. It was 5 minutes walk to Ala Moana shopping centre although a bit longer into Waikiki. there's an ABC shop on the corner and a McDonalds nearby as well as a few restaurants. CONS - I agree with another poster that they could try to clean their rooms faster - we got back some days at about 4pm and our room still hadn't been done but that was a minor irritation. There was a bit of noise but we had the air-con on so that drowned it out. On the first morning we were there some kids were diving in the pool at about 6am but they were quickly told to stop. Also the toilets sound like airline toilets when they flush so you hear the neighbouring rooms flushing but you get used to it. lol. We had a room right down the hall from the check-in counter so I can't comment on the lift because we didn't use it. The only other downside I can think of is that we had to go to the Aqua property next door to do our laundry but housekeeping was using all the washers and dryers to do the sheets and towels so they should really have separate facilities for guests. Apart from that it was a great stay and we would definitely stay there again.","Brisbane, Australia","rosemaryo23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",21,5.0

Most hotels were priced over $175.00, the we came across the Equus. We were hesitant at first as it was a newly renovated hotel and there have been many reviews since the renovations were completed. But at an average of $80.00 per night, we decided we'd take the gamble. We arrived late night and did have some difficulty finding the place, as it is not a very large building. Our first impression was that the front dest looked like some cheap motel ( I say this in comparison to the usual Sheraton, Hilton, etc..). However, the clerk was very nice and efficient. The rooms were spotless, which is the first thing I look for in a hotel. And the bed....what can I say...If I could have fit it in my luggage, I would have taken it home! I guess the bed provides the extra comfort you'll need to get a good night's sleep with all the noise coming from outside. We were on the 4th floor and still it sounded like there was a traffic jam in our room. It does quiet down late at night. Housekeeping was not very well organized, we often came back to our room in the late afternoon ( 3 or 4PM) and housekkeping had come by, but only to pick up the dirty towels and UNmake the bed...Another crew would come in later with clean towels and line (usually around 4:30, as they finished at 5:00Parking is located in a separate building behind the hotel, and is secured by a remote controlled gate. This was not a big inconvenience, as it is only a 30 second walk to the parking. And besides, parking is only $15.00 a night compared to $25.00 charged by most other properties. The pool is nothing to write home about...it is located between two buildings so it does not get much sun...it was so cold, that a hotel employee was surprised I was actually swimming in it!

To my and my daughter's delight...the accomodations provided at The Equus were just fine! The owners did a fine job of renovating the rooms.

A person can not arrive at this property expecting the upgrades usually found in bigger hotels! The staff was pleasant with us and helpful when we needed help! Again...expect simple and pleasant!

Most of the ""complaints"" you read are true- stairs to get to lobby, slow elevator service, difficult to spot the entrance if you are unfamiliar with Waikiki, the microwave is off the lobby, not in the room, and the shower is quite small.That being said, the rooms are large, nicely remodeled, and have everything except the microwave that you would expect in a mid-scale establishment. The staff is top-notch; knowlegable and friendly! We stayed on the fourth floor, and utilized the stairs whenever not carrying luggage to avoid the slow (very slow) elevator. It was a short, pleasant wlak to the heart of Waikiki (restaurants on Kuhio, shopping on Kalakaua) and about a 20 minute stroll to the Aqaurium. Only about a 10 minute walk to Ala Moana Beach/Park, which is a nice alternative to the crowded beach at Waikiki, we only rented a car on days we were traveling to the Aloha Stadium Swapmeet and Polynesian Cultural Center.Housekeeping was very good, and unlike other hotels in this price range, they gave us coffee everyday without a $2-3 charge. I am a ""bargain"" shopper when it comes to hotels in Waikiki, and this was a supirior value to the Ohana properties I usually book at. We spent our last two nights at the Royal Hawaiian (using SPG points) and preferred the facilities and staff at the Equus. Off-peak, I would pay up to about $120 a night for this property, but got this trip for just $80 on Expedia.TIPS: Rent a car from the Enterprise on Kalakaua about three blocks from this hotel only on the days you really need a car, returning to the enterprise lot at night and save the hassle and expense of parking. Online a base car runs $33 with taxes, and you can book it from the computer in the Equus lobby for .15 a minute.

There is only one elevator which goes from the 2nd floor upwards. Today, the elevator got stuck - which meant I was stuck on the 6th floor and I had a tour departure to meet in 15 minutes.I chose this hotel due to the price, its location and the fact it was a strictly no smoking hotel. I must walk with a cane and travel with a respirator. It was a very difficult climb up those stairs daily to the point that I reduced a lot of the activities I would have done.Another point I must state - when I booked my reservation, I was not told that there is a substantial daily parking charge.Furthermore, in route to Hawaii, we were stranded overnight in Chicago. The airline we were flying contacted them to let them know we would not be arriving that night and a supposed Equus hotel manager said we would likely not be charged for that first night which had been guaranteed with a credit card. Upon arriving, I found out that I was still charged for the unused night, and no one knew who the person was with the name given, nor when the manager (with a different name) of the hotel would be back. If we had known then when the airline called, we would have been reimbursed by the airline at that time. This I feel is grossly unfair on the part of the hotel.Overall, the staff is fabulous.

We stayed there for 7 nights from 14 March 2007 to 21 March 2007 and we enjoyed every minute of our stay. The staff were very friendly, resourceful and extremely helpful. We didn't have a street directory so we asked them for direction. First up was for the quickest way to the Airport. The direction was very clear and effective that we got there in 20 minutes. On Friday 16 March, we asked for the direction to La'ie as we booked to tour the Polynesian Cultural Centre. We followed the instructions and we got there in 50 minutes. We were happy to pay $15 per night parking fee as this was well publicised beforehand in ---. This is quite reasonable in comparison to parking in Sydney City where we pay the same amount or more for a 3 hours parking except perhaps for the Casino where we pay $10 for the whole night. The room was very clean and what we saw on --- was exactly what we received when we got there. The maids cleaned our room on a daily basis. We love the location 'cause it's only a short walk to the Ala Moana Shopping Centre. For Swimming, we walked across from Ala Moana Shopping Centre to Magic Island where they have a beautiful beach for swimming, not to mention the beautiful Ala Moana Park. If you head towards the other direction to Waikiki, ABC stores is at the corner and McDonalds is immediately on the opposite side of the street. If you'd like a swim along that side, just walk across from McDonalds towards the Ilikai Hotel and walk along the jetty until you come to another beautiful beach where they have all the surfers heading out for the big waves while you swim at the lagoon. At the next Corner is Wailana Coffee Lounge (and Karaoke Bar) which opens 24 hours. Across the Street from the Wailana is the Todai Japanese Seafood Buffet that serves scrumptuous food at a reasonable price. The hotel has a small pool and I enjoyed my swim there with a very peaceful surrounding. It was great also to be able to phone to any local number free of charge. I guess my only complaint was walking up the steps from the street to the lobby, but then this gave me a good exercise. Overall we had a fabulous time at the Equus and we would stay there again if we go back to Hawaii.",Sydney,"Touhuni</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",16,4.0

What the other reviewers said is basically true--what used to be a motel-type building stuck between two larger buildings next to a busy road is being upgraded to a 'boutique' hotel. Basically, the interior and exterior are two different stories: the entrance is a just a staircase off the street, and there's virtually no lobby to speak of; the reception is located in the elevator hall. But once you get inside the room (one of the renovated ones, that is), everything is there; you could almost believe you're in a four-star hotel. Comfy bed, flat-screen TV, granite counter-top, empty fridge, nice clean bathroom, complete set of toiletries, nice strong shower; the in-room wireless internet was 'free' but flaky; if you use the internet station downstairs it costs you 15 cents a minute. Parking is 15 dollars a day (although you could wing it and park overnight in the nearby streets, e.g. along the canal). Free morning call at 8:45am every weekday courtesy of drilling and hammering. As for view--what you see is just the building next door or busy Ala Moana Blvd. Location--it's more like a 15-20 minute walk to central Waikiki, or you could take the $2 shopping shuttles. In summary, if you could get a good price for the room and don't care about the setting, this place might work for you. But wait till the construction is over.",California,"abcde399</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",43,3.0

We decided to stay here as it was advertised as a value-for-money, newly-renovated hotel. I booked our accommodation through Expedia Australia which looked to be the best value for the accommodation. Prior to booking the accommodation, I also emailed (--)to confirm that all rooms had been renovated as previous posts below recommended that I get a renovated room. I received a response from ""Amanda"" from Aqua's Central Reservation to confirm that all rooms had been renovated. Also, as per previous posts, I requested for a room on high level. Now here is our story...We got a room on Level 9 - and it's a 10-storey building. We DID NOT get a renovated room - or at least I say this because it looked NOTHING like the pictures. The carpet was old and water-stained, the furniture was dilapidated and TV was not an LCD flat screen. We did not have a microwave in the room unlike the published Aquakit thing-a-ma-jig, rather there was a communal microwave on the ground floor behind reception.On our first day - extremely tired from the 10.5 hour from Sydney, we were kept awake by drilling. The staff would yell and scream down the hallway and even up and down the floors. Even when the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was at our door, the housekeeping staff would still try and enter the room - the only thing that maintained our privacy was the door chain. The noisy staff carried on pretty much throughout the first week.Then on the second week, they seemed to have disappeared. Didn't hear a peep. Didn't even see them. But our room still got fixed - sometimes.We found that if we left the room after noon, chances are our room would not get fixed/cleaned. We liked the Waikiki nightlife, so we slept in on most days. So all-in-all within our 11 night stay, our room was probably attended to about 6 times. We never got the chance to have the complimentary breakfast either- but I saw it briefly one morning and it didn't look like something worth peeling myself out of bed for.The well published Linelle was friendly, but so were other younger guys (sorry I didn't get their names). But there were these two older gentlemen- One had a slick ponytail and one had greasy curls. Could someone teach these guys how to smile? They had a ""don't you dare talk to me"" aura and trigger-happy deathstares. If you don't like your job, quit and stop ruining our vacation! ;o)We are a young couple working in the IT industry. The internet in our room was reliable and we enjoyed the cable TV. We loved the location as it was 100m to Ala Moana and an easy 10 minute walk one-way to Waikiki. We were packing down food like it was going out of fashion and since we would take about 2 round trips to Waikiki daily (for afternoon beach and for dinners), the walks helped us keep the weight down. The food was also cheaper at Ala Moana so we would lunch there and dinner at Waikiki. We would walk back to the hotel after 11:30 nightly (since all shops at Waikiki closed at 11:00pm but we would have Cold Stone Creamery on the way home) and we never had any issues in terms of safety.Would I recommend it? Well, I think there is a negative wherever you stay, unless you're willing to pay through the nose. This is a reasonable budget accommodation and perhaps we would stay here again as the location, free internet and cable suited us. I guess I just feel duped by some of what they published and we never got - well mainly the fact that all the rooms had been renovated. We definately would not recommend it to our parents as they would probably feel like they're staying in a motel along a major highway, and I would NOT recommend it to young families as it is right at a main road and it may be tricky getting in and out with kids and the steep flight of stairs from the street to the front door. But if you just want a room that is closer to a nice mall and the Hilton Beach than a famous, over-crowded beach (Waikiki), and you don't mind the street noise - all on a budget - well then this may just be the hotel for you.","Sydney, Australia","kimonio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",16,2.0

Linelle at the front desk was warm and welcoming. She had many suggests for how we might want to start off our first evening in Oahu. Linelle is actually one of the Equus' selling points. Her cordial nature makes you feel like the Equus could be your home away from home. We enjoyed her service very much. The room was eloquently renovated and looked EXACTLY like the advertised photos online (at the hotel's website.) Need I say more??? I would recommend it highly. However, as with any of the downtown hotels, prepare yourself for the typical traffic related noises. The furnishings were very nice and warm and the true granite tops throughout and plasma TV were classy additions. Something noteworthy that you wont catch in the online pictures is the atmospheric recessed lighting throughout. It's the perfect finishing touch to nicely decorated room ... give the Equus a try...it's a great place to stay that's easy on the pocketbook.Michael G",california,"greddygirl83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>california</strong>",12,4.0

We enjoyed the Equus and it's friendly staff. Linelle greeted us each morning at breakfast with her warm Hawaiian smile.. Everyday the Equus offers coffee, tea, juice, pastries and fresh fruit for its guests' all at no extra charge. At check-in we were greeted by friendly and helpful local staff that checked us in with ease and remembered us by name. This time we were given Hawaiian bottles of water at check in. It was a wonderful surprise and very appreciated.Our room was very warm and cozy. It has free wireless, free phone calls and our room came with a coffeemaker and a nice refrigerator with a nice size freezer compartment for our nightly pints of haagen dazs ice cream.

Beds were very comfortable.You can't beat the location. Only 2 blocks from Ala Moana Shopping Center and 2 blocks from the closest beach. We didn't have to rent a car. Parking is only $15 per day .

I was placed in one of what previous reviewers have described as the newly-renovated rooms.The good:The room itself was sparkling new and well-appointed. The flat-screen TV showcased NFL playoff highlights from earlier in the day, equestrian-themes art decorated the walls, and a fairly large lanai contained a table and a couple of chairs. The king bed was very comfortable -- similar to the Hampton Inn chain's Cloud Nine beds, but a little firmer and a more comfortable top layer of linens. Also a mini-fridge.High-speed Internet access in the room was available either through a direct Ethernet cable or through a wireless hub located underneath the television. The wireless signal easily reached to the lanai. For those who might not be bringing their computers to Oahu, the lobby is outfitted with a couple of $0.15/minute workstations and a printer.Good bathroom toiletries -- an ample supply of soft towels and extra shampoos and soaps provided. Quite useful for taking two or three showers a day! Had plenty of hot water on all occasions.Service was excellent and very hospitable. Had nice chats with several of the folks in the lobby, and they were quite enthusiastic and welcoming.Finally, the location is terrific. Right across the street from the Hawaii Prince, which means you do have to cross the street to get to the beach. But you have easy access to Ala Moana beach park (less crowded, more locals) as well as Waikiki. Easy parking with full in and out privileges, but it does cost $15/day. The location is pretty good if you're driving, as you don't have to fight the Waikiki mess to get downtown, out of town, or to the airport.The not-so-good:Road and parking lot noise from below definitely drifted into the room. The management would do well to invest in better-fitting, and better sound-insulating, doors and windows to the lanais. In the meantime, perhaps a higher floor would be helpful, although the single elevator is pretty slow.Finding the right driveway for the hotel the first time was difficult, and the staff of the adjacent Aqua property directed me into their parking garage, for which the Equus staff didn't have a remote control to let me out. Once I got into the Equus parking lot, there was no problem.Although the website promises an in-room safe, my room was lacking one. And I was told that they are small safes, that wouldn't hold a laptop computer in any case. Folks, if you're going to advertise in-room Internet access and be a ""boutique,"" you're going to attract business travelers extending their stay, and you need to have a way for them to secure their laptops.The mixed:Breakfast. Although the fresh oranges were fabulous, the orange juice was not so good. Coffee was good, but the mix of baked goods was always short on muffins (very popular), so much of the time the only choices were croissants (without jam or butter to top) or blueberry rolls (look better than they taste).The hotel has a pool, but I was too busy at the beach, touring the island, and visiting friends to check it out.
