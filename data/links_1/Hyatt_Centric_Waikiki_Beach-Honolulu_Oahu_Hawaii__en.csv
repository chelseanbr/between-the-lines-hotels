The rooms are well appointed and very comfortable. While most people are vacationing here this hotel provides the perfect peaceful setting for those that are in the city for business. Outstanding food and convenient location to other restaurants in the area.

This is one thing that needs to be addressed by all major hotels as guests arriving after a long flight there needs to be some leniency in allowing them to a room to freshen up. The other factor was that although the hotel advertises it has a pool you can not swim as it is only ankle deep, if we had known this at the time of booking we would had gone elsewhere. There was also certain things that we liked about the hotel, one was location as it was close to the beach, restaurants, bars and transport, the rooms were also a good size but the fridge could be larger, the bathroom was a good size but lighting poor, toilet area could be enclosed, there is no laundry and directions to one were incorrect, but there is one close by as we found, the in house restaurant meals were good as well as the service, although the hotel offered bar service it only opened 3 days after our arrival and then only stayed open for about 4 days of our stay. Overall our stay was good and most of the staff were friendly and helpful but due to Covid 19 pandemic services became very thin in Waikiki about 6 days before departure and it was hard to get healthy food.",,Explorer61689,0,4.0

First we had an unpleasant incident with finding a sizeable bloodstain on one of the ""fresh"" bath towels in our room. To her credit the housekeeping supervisor who was on duty yesterday addressed the issue and made amends for it. I sincerely wish the problems ended there but unfortunately they didn't. We asked at 10:15 am today to have our room cleaned; we got back 3.5 hours later at 1:45 pm with hot food and the housekeeper had just started cleaning. He said he had no idea we had asked the room to be cleaned a long while ago. He wanted to continue cleaning while we ate our food, which is ridiculous, we have the right to eat in peace. And we didn't want to schlep our food down to the lobby and eat it there because we don't want to touch all those public surfaces with the Coronavirus going around. We were hoping to rest in the room for a bit after lunch but of course that didn't happen, thanks to housekeeping. We had to hang out in the lobby area until 3:00 PM when the room was finally cleaned. To add to our miseries, the internet was down across the entire hotel all day until around 3:00 PM (which is 7:00 PM East Coast Time, and so the entire business day was wasted!), and even though we are on holiday we still have work obligations that must be done online and it was really inconvenient to tell clients and colleagues to wait because we are in Hawaii and don't have internet access at our hotel.And multiple other little annoyances such as we asking the housekeeper in writing to only leave us all regular coffees and NO decaf, and coming back to find ALL decaf coffees left in our room. I know this sounds minor but little things like this count towards the guest experience and comfort.A different housekeeping manager on duty today reached out to us and offered some meaningless apologies which didn't do anything to reverse the fact that our day was ruined by this hotel, between the lack of internet access all day and the disastrous bungling by housekeeping.This property has the potential to be a good hotel but it is badly let down by its housekeeping, Very disappointed!","Logan, Utah","utqiagvik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Logan, Utah</strong>",107,1.0

Our room had a fabulous view of the ocean and Diamond Head from the 21'st floor, but there was a hole larger than a dollar bill in the carpet in front of a closet and the shower leaked so badly we were mopping up with bath towels after every shower. It was a stay for our wedding and none of the staff could explain their dry cleaning service for pressing my dress, so I ended up ironing it myself on my wedding day for an hour and a 1/2. Staff was VERY friendly, just not knowledgeable. When I tried to plug in the iron, the electrics didn't work on one of the 4 outlets in the room, the easiest to use with the ironing board. The pool is minuscule, a kiddie wading pool and you are a long 5 blocks from the beach, NOT a resort in my opinion, more a business hotel where they thought they could charge resort fees if they let you borrow a boogie board - you WILL pay resort fees of close to $50 per night with taxes, and the parking is outrageous. During our stay there were plumbing issues on the ground floor and the ceiling was open and a horrible smell was permeating the place at the ground floor elevators for over a day. When I brought my issues up at check-out I did get one day of our resort fees waved by the desk supervisor - but that felt stingy to me when it was our wedding and we were already stressed. She asked if I called about the electrics...oh, sure, on my wedding day I'd like to either change rooms, or have someone investigating wiring under our feet - no thanks. We made do and just won't ever return, I suggest you skip this one unless you get a really good deal and don't mind paying a resort fee on top of that deal.",,learningexperience,0,2.0

The location is right in the middle of Waikiki surrounded by high end shopping on one side, and as is the case in Honolulu, graffiti covered shuttered buildings on the other. The price was excellent (paid about $160 a night out the door as a globalist). Staff were all nice, and the breakfast was nothing extensive, but solid quality with a few rotating items like pancakes and french toast. We were upgraded to exactly the required room per the Hyatt terms, nothing more nothing less. Room was a nice size, with a few of the city (which you can honestly do without). Shower was a good size, and the products (shampoo, soap etc) were all fine. No special note, treat, or any recognition as a globalist in the room, which a lot of hotels do, and nothing really explained regarding benefits at check in. Breakfast is an obnoxious 0600 to 1000, so get up early if you want to eat. The pool is kind of small and more of a very shallow place to sit in a chair in the water and relax, and the hot tub is a decent size, although it could have been a little hotter. Nice little deck for the pool area though and a nice place to relax.The staff were watching the manager's dog, Nasa, while we were there and she was present in the lobby behind the desk, so extra points for that. Hooray Nasa! Lots of places nearby to eat, like the excellent udon shop that is super popular and the japanese food hall across the street.Overall, if I were in Waikiki again, I would stay here again unless it was an insane price. Personally I would not pay more than maybe $250 max out the door and that would be pushing it. Really no complaints about the hotel at all. Truth is, I just don't care for Honolulu so my odds of returning are slim, but it has nothing to do with the hotel.",Wherever the cheap fares take me,"trahveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wherever the cheap fares take me</strong>",152,4.0

Comfortable beds, friendly staff. Cons: There is no pool. The ""pool"" is a water feature thing that only goes about fourteen inches deep. So don't expect days lounging by the pool or to get in a traditional swim. If you want to swim you'll have to do it in the ocean, which is fine. I felt this was misleading though, as I like to swim for exercise. Restaurant is overpriced and not very good. Cocktails not very good either. Resort fee not really worth it.

Ocean view is not exactly what you would expect as the hotel is several blocks from the water and the “view” is just a sliver of blue over tons of other buildings.  Location: other than not being oceanfront, the location is pretty perfect. Centrally located in Waikiki with access to tons of shops and eateries practically right outside your door. There is a Starbucks and Jamba Juice attached, and we made use of the Starbucks every day. The tea shop up the block near Ross is awesome. Having a Ross so close was a godsend as literally everything you might have forgotten to pack is right there, and at very reasonable cost. Ross will even validate your parking for the attached garage (not Hyatt’s) for 2 free hours with ANY purchase. Tip: if you don’t want to pay $45 per night for Hyatt parking, the garage attached to Ross charges $15 for 10 hours. If you are out all day and only use overnight parking, this is a huge $ saver. Room: our room was fresh, spacious and beautiful. The ocean view suites are the smallest suites, and I wish we had booked the Mountain View one which I believe is about 200sf bigger. The ocean view wasn’t worth it as it’s barely a sliver of ocean. Only complaint about the room was the tub, which had tons of black mold in the overflow slot, and made it virtually unusable. Some bleach would fix this. Bed, lines, towels, furniture etc were wonderful. Reusable water bottles a great touch. Room was filled with sunshine all day. Food: we only tried breakfast buffet which was adequate, nothing special and cost $30 with tax/tip. My daughter only one who partook. I was fine with Starbucks. Service: very nice, cheerful staff. Why four, not five stars? I did notice some irate people at checkout a few times, and it always appeared to be over one thing: resort fee. This hotel is NOT a resort (not on beach, no real pool, no spa, no grounds, no room service, etc) and has no business charging a resort fee. We didn’t use one single aspect of it, and it sucks to have to pay for something you don’t use. If the hotel wants to charge for those “amenities“ listed under resort fee, it should be optional to guests to partake or not. It left a bad impression on us.

I also made a special request during booking that I do not want my room at the end of floor corner and somehow, I was given a room (#1903) which was actually kinda at the corner and right next to the elevator area. I can hear the elevator noise especially at night which was kinda of annoying. Also, the quilt was old and stained.The resort pool is also a disappointment that it is so small and cannot be said to be a resort at all. The pool was very shallow. The only good things are the very convenient location of the hotel and the very friendly attitude of the staff.

Best place we’ve stayed in Honolulu for the many years we’ve been visiting our favorite island for all the possibilities. Ground floor connected to a Starbucks Reserve, across the street from an amazing Japanese Food Hall, around the corner from even more yummy food options. One block from main thoroughfare with all the shopping that Waikiki has to offer, including the newly renovated International Marketplace. The room itself was beautifully appointed with tasteful furnishings all clean - felt like a spa. Bathroom was spacious and had both separate tub and shower with nice motion sensors for automatic lighting. Separate space for the toilet was a nice touch. The elevators to the lobby (upstairs on the 8th floor from the ground drop off entrance) and guest room were fast - never waited more than a minute. We had a nice elevated view and could see the ocean with some buildings scattered about. Still nice. Great safety key in system for the elevator. Check in was really nice too - complimentary lei and a fruity ginger spritz drink. Staff were friendly and helpful. Even they aren’t in the beach directly, the hotel loans out all the beach supplies - towels, chairs etc you’ll need for some sun and water beach fun.

The Hyatt Centric Waikiki is not an exception. You fulfill wishes without asking for it, already at the check-in, you make your customers feel home from the moment they arrive. The room we got at this Hyatt is modern, beautiful has a great view, is silent and spacious. In general this Hyatt has no rooms below the 7th floor, which is great (both for silence and view). The beach is not far away and the offered services awesome. This stay finally convinced me (after already having a wonderful stay at the Waikiki Hyatt Regency and an awful, terrible stay the the Laylow next door) to always choose Hyatt hotels over others, wherever I can. You make vacations what they should be like - relaxed, stress free and enjoyable.

There are no balconies (in case this is something you really want) but the location is great, a short walk from the beach and the great shops and restaurants of Waikiki. We had an Ocean View suite which was worth the upgrade for the space, but not so much for the view (stay on beach if you want proper ocean views) or the bath (it was a half-size bath more suitable for children and not big enough for adults to enjoy a good soak!). Breakfast staff were friendly, but choices were limited and by the end of the stay we were sick of the sand few options being rotated. We weren’t impressed to find a 20% gratuity automatically added to our bill each day for buffet. We wanted to tip individual staff with cash at the end of the stay, but ended up not doing so due to the forced gratuity which the hotel took. I hope this actually made it back to staff. The pool area is lovely, calm and quiet compared to other busy Waikiki hotels - but don’t expect a proper pool. As clearly highlighted on the hotel website, this is more of a “splash” area, but the large hot tub was fantastic and it was always easy to get a sun lounge. It’s just a shame that the pool bar didn’t open until late in the day and there was no pool-side service like you get at other hotels. The Manager Dan was very helpful and lovely to deal with - an asset to the hotel. Other staff were friendly but less helpful (when we rang front desk to Iet them know on two separate occasions that something wasn’t working in our room, no one came to fix them!). And as with all Waikiki hotels, beware the dreaded resort fee. The fee here was particularly expensive given that it’s a hotel not a resort, and all you’re really getting for your $ is a plastic water bottle!

However, the hotel was not what we imagined it would be based on the photos provided by the website.The room we booked initially, was much smaller than what photos captured. With a toddler accompanying us, we had no choice but to upgrade to a larger room - only a suite was available. Since the suite is one of the hotels ""nicer"" suites, we anticipated some slightly better accommodations but didn't quite experience them. Daily room service was performed at a minimum - empty the trash, fix the bedding, change the towels. One day the room didn't even get serviced. For a hotel that houses guests coming from the beach - I would expect that vacuuming would be a regular occurrence, didnt happen.I also noticed torn bedding and the crib we requested was torn as well. I understand the concept of how hotels work and that hotel materials go through a lot of wear - but i would expect that wear to get filtered and not make it to the guest for use. Lastly, the ""splash lounge"" pictured on the hotel website is at a max 14"" depth. That was probably the biggest disappointment. During one of the warmest and most humid visits to Waikiki - we didn't even bother using the pool because I personally didn't think it was worth getting wet for. I took my toddler a couple of times and she seemed to have fun. It was approximately waist deep for her and she is 2.5. Overall, I think our stay was salvaged by the fact that we upgraded to a suite. It gave us a little more room and space for the toddler.

The next morning we had breakfast and there were kids(girls) running around the pool not dressed in their underwear. No one addressed the parent about how inappropriate this was and awful to witness. To make matters worse it turned out to be an employee of the hotel kids. The breakfast was good except they didn't have the orange souffle pancakes that were on the menu. The staff was nice but it was not the experience that I was looking for. The location was across the street from a boarded up building so not the ambiance or the safety that comes to mind when you see the pictures on the website. Also it's several blocks from the beach.

This was our honeymoon and a king bed would have been much more ideal. Then on night two of our stay we discovered our air conditioning was not turning on. When I called down they stated they would have someone look at it. We got a call a few minutes later stating it coudn't be fixed (it almost sounded like they had been aware of the problem for a while as no one actually came to the room to check). They then said they had another room available that night. Our options at 8:30 PM were to pack everything up and change rooms or stay in our rapidly humidifying and muggy room as they could not fix the AC. Our new room was supposed to be very similar with a smaller sitting space but a bigger bathroom (with a tub). The bathroom was overall MUCH smaller. The shower was smaller and there was only one vanity (vs the two in the previous room). The sitting room was indeed smaller as well. We were just not impressed with the lack of consideration shown to us. Everything was done and said with a cheery smile but we were very disappointed to have started off our relaxing and happy honeymoon with such a poor experience. ** Also to note the chrome cast in our first room was not hooked up properly.

We choose Hyatt Centric Waikiki Hotel.The old Waikiki Trade Center was extensively renovated several years ago and the Hyatt Centric has the entire building with parking from the 3rd floor to 6th floor, hotel offices on the 7th floor, hotel lobby on the 8th floor, and guest rooms from 9th floor to 22nd floor.At the front desk, we were warmly greeted and welcomed as if we were returning guests. The staff was very friendly.Our room #2108 was two queens with an ocean view. Our view overlooked the many rooftops and flanked by the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel and the Top of Waikiki (Hawaii’s only revolving restaurant) on top of the Waikiki Business Plaza building. The view was very nice with the floor to ceiling windowsOur room was very spacious with 2 queen beds and with a large dresser, large screen TV, and wardrobe closet combination unit. Krueger Coffeemaker, mini-refrigerator, safe, and a comfortable easy chair and ottoman completed the room. Even the bathroom was very large with separate water closet (heated seat) and a soaking tub inside a very humongous walk-in shower. ((Every night I would shower and then soak in the tub...very relaxing. Later, I found out that the soaking tub is not available in all guest rooms, but those room ending in xx08)).The guest room were well decorated and coordinated in light off-whites with hardwood floor in entrance foyer and bathroom. There were 1-USB port and 2-electric plugs on the each side of the night stand for charging.The public areas were well decorated, very inviting, and comfortable atmosphere on the 8th floor lobby with boarding pass printer, fitness center, an outdoor pool/deck, restaurant & bar.Boarding Pass Printer: Two desktop computers & printer are available 24/7 for ready access.Fitness Center (24/7)The fitness room is small size with good variety of equipment — the treadmills, bicycle machines, step master, free weights along with hot & cold water dispenser and towels.Pool/Deck (6am-10pm): At the pool area, there are 3 wading pools. One with 3-foot depth hot pool (100 degree temperature), second one with depth ranging from 3-inches to 9-inches depth, and the third one with a 14-inches depth. There were several cabanas, half-dome chairs, many lounge chairs throughout the deck area.Restaurant (6am – 11am): The breakfast buffet tends to be hearty and adequate. Fresh juices - grapefruit, orange, passion fruit ; milk- regular, 2%, non-fat; four cold box cereals are available; fresh fruits - cantaloupe, grape, and oranges; yogurt; hot scramble eggs and meat (rotates every day -- sausage, sausage patty, or bacon); waffles or pancakes; baked goods - croissants, coffee cake, muffins, bread (white, wheat, and rye); and hot tea or coffee. Also omelettes are made to order (egg whites only are also available).Bar (2pm – 9pm): The bar is adjacent to the lounge arewhich was especially nice since it was quiet setting for sitting & relaxing with the Hawaiian motif. There is parking in the garage in the building and wifi.The Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center and Internal Marketplace Shopping Center are within 5 minutes walking distance from Hotel. Nordstrom’s Rack and Ross Dress for Less are next door on the same block.Waikiki Trolley Stop #1 is one block away. The trolley lines cover Waikiki Beach area and the dining scene area. The Honolulu public transit system “The Bus” provides easy access from Waikiki area to Ala Moana Shopping Center, Downtown, Chinatown, Iolani Palace (the only palace on US soil), and the airport. In a nutshell:Bed mattress - firm and very comfortable Pillow - several pillows & fluffyBathroom - very roomyShower - separate, very roomy & hand sprayTub - high side tub & great for soaking Sofa & Chair - comfortable & no sunken spotsElec Outlets/USB ports - yes ... at night stand View - good ocean view between buildingNatural Lighting - southern exposureElectrical Lighting - good for relaxing & readingRoom Cleanliness- YesFresh Linens & Towels - YesStaff - very friendly & helpful Public Space - very relaxing and comfortableSince this building was formerly office building, there are several types of guest room layouts.

I however expected the hotel to be in super good shape as it was newly opened in 2018 but the sheets and the room conditions were not as nice as I expected it to be (not bad but not as super nicely new) The room sizes are bigger than the normal hotels that you would stay in. Pools are find with hot jacuzzi too but not for adults swimming. It is very shallow which would do only good for the kids. The biggest reason that I gave “average” for this hotel was because the hotel was very noisy (even at nights). I had to move my room after one night because I couldn’t sleep due to construction noises - i found out where the noise came from. It was from the elevator motors that was right below the room which was awful. Then the new room that I moved in also had this hideous sounds which I think was because of the parking lot right below. Some creepy machine sounds late at night and even in early mornings. Other than that, most of the staff were very kind and friendly and within the resort fee that I have to pay, they provide all kinds of beach stuff (boogie board, beach towels, chairs, umbrellas, and even sun screen and after sun aloes) so if you do stay with the hotel, pls try to fully leverage those privileges. Oh one more thing that I remembered - the restaurant that is in the lobby floor only serve breakfast which staff are not very helpful - they don’t come around to take orders... do not recommend...Takes one big block plus crossing the street to access to the beach so if you plan on going to the beach every day, would recommend a closer hotel.

That is, there were a few things you'd look at and thing it was an interesting choice. Nothing particular damaging or irritating, but more whimsical. Things like an air conditioner that made so much noise you occasionally felt the Island of Oahu was moving a bit to the left, or a bathroom that led you to believe someone in the Hyatt Design Team is a Salvadore Dali fan, or the strangely robotic toilet seat. Some fun quirks that gave the property some character. So that combined with some great service and a good location earns them my four stars. Where they loose almost 1.5 stars is the pool and the resort fee. The pool that they seem to use as the hero shot in all the advertising is in reality ankle deep.

While most places in Hawaii go for a tired tropical look, this place was sleek and modern with great.staff.It's not worth paying for a beach view room, as the ocean is some distance away, and the view often blocked by other high rises. Choose a suite, like us, if you want a small separate lounge but the room was big enough without it. Bathroom was a decent size that opened out to the bedroom which some people may find off putting.Be warned, if a pool is important, the pool here is more for effect, as it is very shallow for preening around and splashing your feet.The extortionate ""resort fee"" US hotels have taken up with gusto in recent years at least delivers some value here, with free towels, beach chairs, water bottles, filling stations and WiFi (but this should be simply standard with any room rate as it would be in most other countries.) We really enjoyed our stay here, and though it delivered great value for a high class modern hotel, close to the action and a short walk from the beach.

It's clean and modern, with friendly, helpful staff. My room was comfortable: A single king-sized bed, a generously sized bathroom, a wardrobe, and a shower. Note that there's no full length mirror or bathtub. For those looking for a tropical vacation atmosphere, this likely wouldn't meet your criteria as the bar and pool area has a very business feel to them. The bar is located inside the building and only open from 5-9 or something along those lines. The lobby isn't open-air, which is a shame, considering Hawaii's often-beautiful balmy weather. The pool looks like it could belong to a small hotel in Vegas—it's a small chlorinated wading pool, with a hot tub on one end. Plastic lounge chairs are attached to the sides, inside the pool so people can dangle a hand or foot into the water to cool down. For those who book later flights departing the island, note that there isn't a courtesy room to shower, so if you want to spend the morning at the beach, then be prepared to smell like the ocean and sunscreen on your flight (not a bad thing, I guess?). Overall, I think this is a nice, comfortable hotel. Just keep in mind that it has a sterile, business-like feel rather than a tropical vacation-like atmosphere, and you're good.

The amenities were awesome, the location is awesome right in the middle of downtown. Easy walking to great eats and shopping. Love the water bottle touch in the rooms and the filtered water for refills in the hotel. A very modern contemporary feel hotel. We made a connection with one of the housekeeping staff because we saw her everyday. She always asked if we needed anything but being so low maintenance we really didnt need much. She always took the time to ask us anyways. Unfortunately we dont remember her name. We knew she was heading to Vegas with her family for the first time and we shared with her all the places she should visit while in Vegas. We will definitely return to this hotel in the future. Ultimately the staff would be the reason we would return to the Hyatt Centric especially Alex!","Vancouver, Canada","Kng604</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,5.0

We had a great experience and are looking forward to staying again. The only two critical points I’d make is the buffet breakfast value for me isn’t there, for the price it seemed like there was too basic of variety for guests. The other, would be the fitness room definitely needs a mirror. I do a lot of weight training and like to check form during reps, this is fairly minor but wanted to present my feedback. Overall a wonderful stay, rooms are spacious and very bright. The in-room speaker was an added bonus as well! Would definitely recommend staying here, location is also phenomenal.

Carpet in hallway smelled like urine, pool had trash and towels laying around and the chairs were missing cushions; no more open restaurant for lunch and dinner, only breakfast; bar tender made a good drink but did not greet me and was grumpy; had to upgrade my room to avoid the noise of the elevator; room was well kept, but the robes showed a lot of wear and tear. Valet attendants were responsive and helpful. Overall the bad outweighed the good and I feel that I did not get the value I paid for and should have chosen another hotel.

Again, very little space to put our toiletries. The pool is a very small splash area with a hot tub. The gym is small with subpar at best. They had one bench for all of the people working out. Guests were literally laying on the disgusting ground lifting weights. There was plenty of room for more benches. The hotel just didn't have them.

Parking was a bit high, so if you rented a car for the ease of family airport and travel maybe only get it for the days needed. If you needed a microwave to steam baby bottles, depending who you asked it was $10/$15 American a day! For a week stay to have sanitary bottles was insane. We also were under the impression we booked the room we ended up getting as an upgrade for $50/ day more. The photos on the booking we selected were not what we booked and ended up being the upgraded room. We were counting on the solid door between rooms for the kids privacy/ noise so again we were stuck with another hidden fee. Our rooms were not cleaned and we were told we had to call each day for room service. It was a bit of a gamble on what would be done when they came, sometimes leaving wet towels or an unmade bed behind. I get this is their busy season but room servicing should just happen. The pool also isn’t a full size pool. It’s about 1 foot deep. My toddler loved it but we were hoping to all enjoy a swim. The ocean was close so that wasn’t a big deal!

We had a great experience here! We were celebrating our 5 year anniversary. When we checked in, Rachel upgraded us to a room on the penthouse level. She said it was available because there is some slight elevator noise in the room. We decided to take it because we sleep with a white noise app on our phones anyway. It didn't drown out the elevator noise completely, but it didn't bother us too much. The room was incredible! We were coming from Maui, and the hotel room we stayed in there was very musty. That wasn't the case with our room at the Hyatt at all, thankfully! It was very well ventilated. Every member of staff we interacted with here was so nice and helpful. The location of the hotel was perfect. The only negatives were that the pool isn't really a pool (it probably isn't even 2 feet deep), and the bathroom could use more light and more towel racks or a piece of furniture to place towels on closer to the tub. The shower actually had a light in it that was very bright! But the light in the mirror at the bathroom sink was somewhat dim, and there was no light above the giant mirror in the bathroom where I ended up doing my makeup often (though it was wonderful to have that mirror). But everything I look for in a hotel room usually, this place had. Comfortable bed and sheets / comforter, nice and clean (the room and bathroom smelled great too), good AC, not musty, good water temperature and pressure, etc. Would definitely recommend staying here!

The Staff is simply awesome. Alex at the front desk, Glenn at the bar are really wonderful. We have been coming to Hawaii 2-3 times a year since 2004 and when we found the Hyatt Centric we loved it so much we have stayed there the last 5 trips. This year when we returned for Christmas we found out they had closed the bar until evening and closed the restaurant except for breakfast. If we wanted to stay at a Hyatt Place, we would have booked at a Hyatt Place. This is a Hyatt Centric and we expect the amenities that come with a higher end hotel, and were very disappointed by these changes. During our stay they showed us the first ""meal"" they would offering while the kitchen was closed. I've been served more appealing food on an airplane...bags of chips with a small hummus selection? It seems as if they closed services to save money with no regard to the guests. I assure you they did not drop the room rate while they figured things out, nor were we aware of these changes when we booked our 5th visit.

The older kids stayed in the living area on the pull out sofa. Skip the $75 per night rollaway and buy an air mattress from Target for around $70 if you need it. The hotel is in an excellent location... Not too busy or loud but right near everything. It is close to International Marketplace and a few blocks to beach. Breakfast buffet was good. They offered eggs made to order, toast, oatmeal, white rice, bacon, sausage, pancakes, pastries and a few desserts as well as pineapple, orange and guava juice. There was also coffee, tea and sodas. Our breakfast room package came with 2 free breakfasts per day and our additional guests were $18.50 each. Kids 4 to 11 were $12.50 and under 4 was free. I wish they would have allowed us to use two coupons one day so we could all eat without having to pay extra. During our stay, they changed the buffet policy so may not offer all items previously mentioned. Not worth the price they are asking for it in my opinion. Wish they had laundry but there are laundromats not too far away. Don't forget to ask for towels and a beach pail and shovel if you are headed to the water. They also occasionally have boogie boards.

We spent 5 nights in a house on Kauai and decided to overnight at the Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach. All five of us were a bit wary of being in the same room but figured we could manage one night. In fact, we could have stayed many more. The service was excellent from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Nothing was overlooked. We were created by reception with a shell lay and even given a gold fish to keep us company. My wife and I enjoyed a cocktail after dinner at the splash pool enhanced with live entertainment. We all enjoyed a delicious breakfast buffet with an Asian flair the next morning and were well fueled for a beautiful morning beaching on Waikiki. Our excursion was complete with beach chairs, an umbrella and towels all supplied by the Hyatt. The experience was wonderful and all in a great value.

Stayed on penthouse level and while the view was great that was all. There was not even a small table provided with chairs to sit at to eat if you chose to eat any food in the room or to sit at a computer/tablet. No complimentary water in the room itself. You have to go to another level in the hotel to fill up from a fixed Britax filter station in your ""complimentary"" water bottle. An ice machine provided also at same location (bonus) but dont try to capture ice in the water bottle or most ice ends upon the floor. The pool is more like a wading pool for kids. Definitely misrepresented by web photos. Room service meal seemed to be ordered from outside the hotel (not the hotel kitchen) delivered in a Uber Eats bag at excessive price. The hotel menu on TV was impossible to fathom out and did not let you minimise the screen to view the whole menu and when queried to reception they could not offer an explanation - so was provided the hardcopy menu from downstairs. Not enough bathroom supplies on arrival. A big positive was being allowed to check in earlier than advertised due to a very early flight arrival. But no kettle (only a coffee machine). No microwave even a small one. But then there would be no room to put this. A very small room for two persons on penthouse level (okay it is a hotel not apartment). When staff were asked about the table nothing happened. Could have complained but just disappointed in this hotel - instead just enjoyed Hawaii. No way to do laundry in the hotel (had to use Ohana East coin laundry which has not changed in 30 years?) Love Hawaii. But would not stay at this hotel again.

With so many other vendors to follow up with, we wanted to find a hotel staff that we could rely on. After touring several hotels in Waikiki, we chose this one because of how we saw the staff treat their fellow coworkers, particularly the relationship between Jeanette and Yukiko. Many hotels are beautiful, BUT you can tell a lot about a business by how the staff interacts with each other. We wanted our guests to feel that aloha spirit, and we found it at the Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach hotel. Our wedding weekend began with a rehearsal dinner at the hotel. With the guidance of coordinator Rommel Espina, he helped us choose a menu for our 87 out-of-town guests. We were told by several people that it was the best food they've ever had at a wedding...and the actual wedding hadn't even happened yet ! We had 14 various countries represented at our dinner, so it was a relief that the food was a universal ""YES!"" Rommel did an amazing job with set-up and allowing us to arrive early to add decor. There is live music at the hotel on Friday nights, so our guests were treated to a show by a famed musician, Tavana, while they ate. (One of the coolest extra touches was the note left in all the hotel rooms letting guests know there would be a reserved dinner that night! Very organized.)Our room was decorated in the most beautiful way, and garnished with a heartwarming note from Jeanette and Yukiko. We were so nervous about our wedding the following morning, but the treatment from the reservations team made us forget about all of our concerns.

Our room was very spacious and comfortable with a nice city view overlooking the pool. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and dinner at the restaurant onsite and it was delicious both times, also not too overpriced. The location is in perfect vicinity to all the action on the main strip, but not too close to be a nuisance. (Sidebar: there’s a Ross just a few steps away that stays open until 1AM and loaded with great finds unlike the ones back home lol). Approximately 6-8 min walk to the beach from the hotel. I would also like to acknowledge the doormen who were pleasant and upbeat even during overnight hours when we made it back in from partying.

Considering we were first-time Hyatt guests, we weren't expecting much since Waikiki is full of tourists, but when we got there, we felt like we number one in the amount of attention they paid to us. Even down to the housekeeping staff or valet who kept doors open for us and greeted us everytime we saw them. Even though there was a resort fee, we made good use of the services like being able to borrow beach chairs, umbrellas, beach toys and towels. It was great knowing that we didn't have to bring any of our own items or go out to buy it at the store. We had sunscreen and after burn as well, but it was nice knowing that if we ran out, the valets had that on hand too.

There was a mix up on check in and our room still had cleaners in it. They quickly rectified this and we were given another room on a higher floor with, I suspect, with a better view. Very friendly and helpful staff. Our Ocean View Room was spacious with plenty of wardrobe and drawer space. Very large bathroom with seperate bath and shower. They could do with some more towel rails to hang wet towels. The bed was super comfortable. The rooms are kept very clean and made up every day. We loved the included water bottles and easy access to the ice water machine on our level 19. The ocean view is a few blocks back from the shore but we could still see plenty of ocean and could see what it was like outside. We really enjoyed the pool area for drinks and a light meal. We also used the lounge area for drinks after being out for dinner. Nice and cosy and relaxing. When visiting the beach we used the towels and umbrellas and chairs. We didn’t have the hotel breakfast due to previous reviews but kept breakfast supplies in our room with the occasional breakfast out. Loved the fact that you need your room card to operate the lift. We loved how the whole hotel was set up and how friendly the staff are. Sure, it would be nice to have a deeper pool but I suspect it would be a more expensive hotel. The position is very handy to everything without being too busy on the Main Street. Overall we had a fabulous time with our late 20s children.

There are some sketchy people out at that time of the morning. I was glad there was security out patrolling the block when I was waiting for my tour pick up.

Food at the Lanai Bar for lunch was delicious. Drinks were awesome. Service was great. We had a waiter serving us outside while we relaxed by the pool. We were also provided with free water bottles on our arrival to avoid wasting plastic bottles. There were water stations on three levels to fill up bottles. Towels and all other beach equipment were readily available. Someone was always at the front desk willing and able to help with any queries. They also have a hotel mobile number you can text with any queries you have, and they were very prompt at responding. Everyone was friendly. The Expedia concierge on level 1 was able to help with planning activities and provide good deals for that. We were offered a $50 credit by the hotel for certain activities such as Pearl Harbour and others. The wifi was good, never had any issues. The only thing I would advise people of is that the pool was not really a ‘pool’, it was completely shallow and more of a ‘wading’ pool that you can’t swim in. This did not bother us or impair our stay at all because we did not care too much about spending our time swimming in the pool, but this is just an FYI to people who are hoping for a pool that you can swim in.

The rooms are stylish, clean, and comfortable. Staff pleasant. But my wife and I came here for a two-night getaway to relax. We choose this hotel over others because of the pool and hot tub. We specifically asked if there was any construction going to be going on during our stay and we were told no. When we arrived the pool was closed for the entire first day and half of the second day we were there. When I did go to the hot tub at 3 pm there were four young kids in diapers with their parents in the hot tub. We did let the hotel know but got a sort of generic response. We were told to report this to the staff when it happened but also told there was no policy for age in the hot tub. So why bother reporting if they cannot do anything? So much for our relaxing resort stay. For $250 per night, we basically got a clean room and a TV. I could have gotten that anywhere for half the price.

We had an ocean view room with two queen beds and it was large enough for the four of us. The bathroom was huge and everything was impeccably clean. What impressed me the most though were the employees and how kind they were. Without exception, they all went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. The true aloha spirit at its best. The helpful valets, the efficient personnel at check-in and checkout, the efficient waitresses with their killer smile at the breakfast buffet, everyone we dealt with was so pleasant and genuinely interested in making our stay a memorable one. I have rarely seen such good customer service through our many years of travel around the world. As others have previously said, the hotel is conveniently located one block away from the shops and restaurants. There are plenty of excellent dining options within a 10 minute walk. The hotel also has beach chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards and towels that you can borrow for a day at the beach. Just a heads up on their pool in case you didn’t check their website carefully, it only has 9-14 inches of water. This was a surprise to us but it was totally our fault. Last thing, if you have a late flight out of Honolulu, they can give you a late checkout for half the price of the daily rate for your room. They don’t have a hospitality suite that you can use to freshen up before your departure but we were told they are working on this to offer more convenience to the traveler. All in all, we highly recoomend this hotel especially for their wonderful staff.

After deciding not to do a tour we asked about car rental but since we weren't doing a tour he had somewhat of an attitude. He told us we wouldn't get a car at the last minute. However we walked in to National which is right around the corner and made a reservation with no issues. Definitely will keep this hotel in mind on my next visit to Honolulu.

We just loved it! My husband kept telling me I had chosen a great hotel! It's a modern newly renovated building with spacious rooms and great views (we had a room on the 18th floor with mountains view - recommend). Clean, comfy and modern. Loved the ""scenic Hawaii"" TV program running 24/7. Quite close to the beach - something like 7-10 minutes of relaxed walk. The only thing you'd have to carry beach gear with you - umbrellas and chairs, kindly provided, - which we didn't mind (but could be not so easy if you are older/frail or have a few kids with you. But honestly, it totally was worth staying in really nice place and walking tiny bit compared to staying close to the crowded beach but in a much poorer room elsewhere. Plus of the location - relatively quiet street and literally a block away from all the shops/restaurants/supermarket etc. Also, check their restaurant - above expectations! Overall, 5 stars for us (and we are not too easy to please normally), recommend to anyone and hope to return there one day :)","Auckland, New Zealand","Ollliiik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",9,5.0

Get $5 credit a day for refusing room service. They still brought us towels and other necessities daily. Floor to ceiling windows and a view of the ocean are a plus! You’re also very central to all the restaurants and shops on the main strip. Shower has a hand held extension which is great because that’s what I’m used to back at home. Two negatives: one would be the auto lights in the bathroom. Lights kept turning off while in the shower and we had to swing the door open for the sensor to realize someone is still in the bathroom.

I regret to say that what took away from our stay in Waikiki, which is out of the control of any hotel here, is the number of homeless people on the streets (very depressing) and the presence of graffiti on some buildings and throughout the city in general. I was not aware of this prior to booking our trip.

Some of the people that made our stay so enjoyable include Melia and Jamie at the front desk, Pookela and Vince for such warm greetings everyday (and storing our surfboards) and Unda for making every breakfast a delight. Everyone was super nice to our dog too, which made our stay very enjoyable. 2 - Location. This hotel is in a great location. It’s very easy to get to the beach and all the shops. The only downside to the physical property is there are no lanais (balconies) but the pool deck makes up for it. 3 - Music. During our state they had amazing musical acts by the pool.

But I did have the absolute pleasure of getting to meet Dan Katona. He greeted us when we arrived. him and a coworker got us checked him. He was familiar with our reservation and greeted us like old friends. I loved that! In my business it’s all about relationships. You have to have the goods (in this case a gorgeous hotel and room) but to keep people coming back you build relationships. Hyatt gets it. We stayed at the Hyatt regency at DFW before we flew to Hawaii. Same friendly staff. Back to the hotel: I loved it. The hotel is new and modern. I did NOT want to stay at an older hotel that smelled like a wet beach towel- you know what I’m talking about. The Hyatt Centric is new and modern. The pool area was small but not crowded with a working jacuzzi (I read somewhere it wasn’t, but it is). The pool is very shallow but I liked it for just hanging out and staying cool. The hotel is very centrally located. We walked everywhere. Rarely even taking an Uber. There are beach chairs with umbrellas available when you walk out. Easy to carry on your back on your 5 min walk to the beach.We worked out 4-6 days without waiting to use the equipment. There were 2 musical events/performances (I would not call them concerts) they went on from around 7-10 by the pool. Really quality performers. I was impressed. Overall it was a great honeymoon in Hawaii for us. The hotel was a huge part of that. I hope to see Dan again someday. He really made us feel like we were friends staying at his house.

We only came to Oahu because we wanted to go to Pearl Harbor and then quickly leave on our way to Maui. We stayed just for 2 nights at the Hyatt Centric in Oahu. The hotel was clean, modern and well kept. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel is not on the beach. It's a quick 5 minute walk. The hotel does offer chairs and towels so you can go to the beach. Our chairs were pretty worn out. The drink holders on the chairs were ripped so our beverages fell right into the sand. They weren't easy to close either. Again just very old and worn out. We went back to the hotel to get into the pool. It's a very small pool area. Not many chairs or lounge chairs for everyone. We had to wait a little to get chairs both times we went to the pool. My biggest complaint is that we were charged a resort fee of $25.00 per night. While I understand that resorts charge a resort fee, this hotel is not a resort. The pool is not an actual pool you can jump into unless you are a child. You can dip your feet in and cool off or roll around in it like we saw 4 adults do since it wasn't an actual pool. It's on the rooftop and it was extremely windy. Our room had a very small ceiling to floor window facing a parking lot and a street, no balcony and we didn't love the bathroom set up as well. Thankfully we only stayed 2 nights. If you are looking for a quick stay with no pool, this is a great hotel. The hotel should reconsider the resort fee as well or include maybe a breakfast. This hotel is far from a resort.

I also have an extreme fear of flying, so I was not able to get any sleep on my flight and was exhausted.Entered the Hyatt Centric Waikiki - all we saw were beautiful, caring and friendly faces. The staff saw my condition and did everything they could to bring me comfort. This meant giving me a room to immediately rest, then finding us a more suitable room. There were constant check ins, offers of tea and honey, assistance with medical appointments - there was nothing they did not do for us.Most of our holiday was spent being unwell and on the days we were actually able to get up and head out, the staff were overjoyed to see us get the chance to enjoy ourselves. Never have we felt more cared for on a holiday.As some time has passed, I have forgotten some names, however the faces I can never forget; a beautiful lady that initially helped us book and answer all our enquiries (Tahnee?) another beautiful lady (I have forgotten her name) with long light brown hair who showed me every room I requested and made sure my family and I were comfortable, a lovely man with dark hair and an earring who ensured we had everything we needed at all times, with the loveliest smile and personality (I have forgotten his name) and Erica, who really did everything she could to ensure I was feeling well and recovering.It was the staff who made this holiday the best ever, considering our circumstances, and for that we are still to this day grateful. The hotel itself is stunning, new, fresh and in the best location. However, it is the staff that make it what it truly is.Thank you again beautiful people, I'm certain you remember us as we do you.

This used to be an office building. The first floors are parking, the lobby, pool, and fitness area are on the 10th, and the rooms go from 9 to 19. Nice new rooms. Instead of giving you two pre-filled bottles of water a day, they give you a pba-free plastic water bottle that you can take home with you, and provide filtered water in the hallways. Very cool.Had a shower only room with an all glass shower, which kind of freaked me out the first time I stepped in, then realized I could see out the window to the neighboring buildings and people could see in! Same thing when using the toilet, you can see outside. Fortunately, none of the neighbors had a view unless they had a telescope with them, and I started to enjoy showering in natural sunlight.My one issue is that the TV is glued to the wall, and there's no hookup for my iPad. Always appreciate hotels that make it easy to connect the iPad to the big screen, not possible here. Watched NETFLIX on a 10 inch screen when I wanted late night TV.Nice staff, except 10 minutes after I checked in, someone walked right into my room without knocking, making a delivery, but to the wrong room as it turned out. Good thing I was still thinking about changing clothes and hadn't started yet.Comparison to the Hyatt Regency (HR):Centric is newer and smaller than the HR Waikiki.Centric is 10 minutes from the beach, HR is 10 secondsCentric has no balconies, HR has great balconies (Centric windows do not open)Centric and HR are both convenient to lots of shoppingCentric has no iPad connections, HR has connections to the TV for iPadAll in all, I prefer the Regency because there is nothing that beats standing on your balcony staring down at the ocean, or being able to walk across the street and be at the beach. But, the hotel experience itself if probably better at the Centric.","Las Vegas, Nevada","unlvbill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",4,4.0

The beach is just a couple of blocks away and you get chairs, umbrellas, and sunscreeen (if you want to) from the hotel as part of the resort feel. Parking is the only downfall, but that's a general thing in the island. Not the cheapest thing, but certainly better than San Francisco. If you're planning to rent a car, be prepared to pay for the parking structure (which includes Valet service).

The Hyatt Centric is two blocks off the Waikiki beach front, but that comes with some major advantages: More reasonable rates for larger rooms with less street noise. The hotel offers a quick and easy walk to all that Waikiki has to offer as well as convenient access to the major thoroughfares for driving to the rest of Honolulu and Oahu. A few caveats:- Reception, concierge, valet and restaurant staff are top-notch (the reception staff definitely went above and beyond for us), but the quality of housekeeping can be hit-or-miss... Excellent and efficient one day and haphazard, bordering on sloppy, the next.- If you want a decent view, city or Diamond Head, be sure you're above the 12th floor.- The hotel employs eco-AC... In larger rooms/suites like we had, it is not always sufficient to properly cool the entire space, especially during the day when sunlight through the windows raises the room temperature, so you have to set the thermostat to a much lower temperature than you would normally expect and be ready for it to take 10-15 minutes for the room to cool down upon return (the system shuts off when the room is unoccupied).- The fitness center isn't worth the extremely limited space dedicated to it... The hotel would be better off using that space for another purpose and forming a partnership with a local gym for those interested in maintaining their training regimen during their visit. The Honolulu Club is only a 10-minute drive away with ample parking and is probably the best fitness center in the city (and they offer day passes).Overall, we had a very pleasant stay in one of their Diamond Head View Suites (with King Bed), but because we got it for a discounted rate, we were on a lower floor without much of a view (not very important to us, but in Hawai'i, having a view can definitely impact the experience).","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Todd G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",11,4.0

We were very pleased with our choice to stay here, as opposed to one of the beachfront hotels that are just a few blocks away. This hotel was completely renovated a year ago. It could pass for new. It even had that ""new hotel"" smell.We had a Diamond Head view Suite, Room 1602. Room was spacious, exceptionally clean and had a modern contemporary design. The side of the room overlooking the city had full glass walls instead of windows. Mattress was soft and comfortable. There were a variety of pillows with different firmness to choose from. One day we were alerted there was going to be a protest in the street the next morning, but we didn't hear a thing. Nor did we hear the sirens, crazy homeless people yelling on the streets, or the madhouse that is Waikiki. Very comfortable stay!Basic Wifi was complimentary and quick enough to stream video without issue. Room Key card needed to access guest floors by elevator. The pool is small and only about three feet deep, and there's no Hot tub to compliment it, but so be it. We don't usually even end up using the pool when we stay somewhere. Located just off the main drag, the beach is less than five blocks away. The surrounding streets are filled with convenience stores, markets, restaurants, high end clothing outlets, etc. anything you might need. However, prices are much lower if you have a car or Uber and can go do your shopping at stores away from the touristy area the hotel is in. If you don't want to spend $50+ a meal to eat out, there's a large food court on the 2nd floor of the mall at the end of Seaside Ave with a decent selection of cheaper offerings. The place was always packed with other tourists.Only two minor issues, not a big deal and not really even the hotel's fault for the second one...After two nights declining housekeeping, they failed to clean our room and change the sheets the third day. We left for the day at noon and took the DND sign down. Cleaners were out in the hall. Had to request sheets/towels, and do it ourselves when we returned that night. They were super quick to bring them up to the room.On the morning we checked out, we'd misread a street sign and got our car towed. The front desk manager was helpful with contacting the police and locating the car. However, she gave us the wrong address for the tow lot. The tow company had moved the year before, way out by the airport, on the the other side of town from where we Uber'd! We spent three hours on a wild goose chase looking for the car! (I think she Googled it and the old address popped up? So I won't blame her for our mistake. ) Make sure to read the signs! With that said...FREE PARKING ADVICEParking is expensive in Waikiki. Usually about $50 per day. However, non-guests can park about a seven minute walk down the street at The Banyan Condo tower garage for $20 per 24 hours. The cheapest you'll find. A real deal actually.Also, free street-side parking can be found three blocks north, along the 1+ mile Ala Wai Blvd, boarding the canal, (everyday except Mon and Fri from 8:30am-11:30am for street sweeping) It's best find a spot early, say, before 4pm. Then leave it there and use Uber for short trips around the city.You can also park for free down by the zoo on Monsarrat Ave, and walk 10 minutes back, or Uber for $5-6. And there is free parking about a mile away on Ala Mona Blvd, -next to the park and Marina-Almost empty late at night. Uber 5 mins back to hotel for $6, or take public bus for $2.50During daylight hours you can park in the large Ala Mona park's parking lot for free. We managed to go a whole week and only paid to park one night. (Although getting towed ruined our pride and savings over the accomplishment!) I recommend renting the smallest compact car. We couldn't have fit into the spaces we found with a midsize or larger. With the compact, we always found a place to squeeze in.","Windham, Maine","Adam81980</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Windham, Maine</strong>",152,4.0

We were incredibly happy with our stay at the Hyatt for several reasons. Firstly, we were in Hawaii for our friend’s wedding - and saw a few other hotels that they stayed at (eg Royal Hawaiian, which I initially wanted to stay at since I have SPG status but so happy I didn’t - rooms are significantly smaller and much more outdated). Hyatt feels brand new, has quite a chic feel to it and has VERY spacious rooms / bathrooms. We requested a baby crib for our arrival , which sadly wasn’t set up when we got there after ten hours of traveling, but the staff (especially Lydia) was incredibly courteous and professional and did right by us! The location is another amazing advantage - as soon as you walk out, you are right on the main boulevard. We also loved the restaurant located inside the hotel - I think it was called Lanai. We rarely eat at hotel restaurants (they are usually underwhelming and overpriced). This one was a pleasant exception - their seafood squid ink pasta is one of the best I’ve had (and I am a foodie!). The one downside is the shallowness of their pool, which other reviewers note. There is a hot tub, which on a hot day is not that pleasant. The shallowness of the pool was actually perfect for our little girl (and other older kids) but don’t expect to be able to do laps there. With that said, it was very serene and pleasant - and we never had an issue getting a (complementary) cabana, which was definitely not the case for our friends in Royal! Overall, very very happy with our stay and special thanks for their professional staff (especially Lydia, who works in Sales I believe, and their housekeeping, that has a top-notch attention to detail..)Highly recommend this hotel for your next vacation to Honolulu. Oh, and if you end up going, make sure to go to the coffee spot right across from H&M on the second floor up the escalator...prob one of the best cafes in the area!

We didn’t have anything negative to say but we also didn’t have anything amazing to say either. Pros:- staff are all friendly. As we arrived into Hawaii early in the morning we couldn’t check in until later that afternoon but after staff seeing my husband and I waiting in the lobby they “upgraded” us to a slightly bigger room so we didn’t have to wait which was nice.- room size is quite good! With a coffee machine in the room. No mini bar though. - they give you free water bottles on arrival and have cold, fruit infused, water in the lobby to re fill your bottle. As well as access to a coffee machine to make yourself a free coffee. Leis on arrival also. - they also give you a $50 voucher to use when booking any tours through them which we used on a helicopter ride. - they have different events on throughout the week such as free yoga class or bands playing. One night Taimane Gardner played in the lobby and that was really cool to watch. - Main Street is a 30 second walk. Ross store right next door. As well as a Starbucks, Nordstrom Rack and an ABC store. Cons: - They charge you an extra fee of $30US everyday to use their amenities such as pool towels, drink on arrival (just fruit infused water), wifi and the gym. They also claim that charge gets you sunscreen, however when we asked for it they didn’t have any. - The pool is just a shallow sitting pool. Can’t actually swim or submerge your body. They have a “hot tub” style connecting to it which is a nicer touch though. - Breakfast selections are limited. We didn’t pay the extra $30 odd for breakfast every morning and kind of glad we didn’t as the buffet is quite small and so is the a la carte menu. Pricy too! - a bit of a walk to the beach. Couple street back but about a 10min walk. Overall we did enjoy our stay just wish we had chosen something a little more “romantic” or closer to the beach for our honeymoon. I feel it’s a great hotel for non honeymooners but if your after something a little fancier maybe something along the beach with a nicer view and facilities.

The room was always turned down with attention to detail, sometimes even twice a day! The room itself was great, I believe they upgraded us from what we originally had which was a plus. The decor is modern and stylish. Soaker tub is a nice touch though it’s very loud when filling/draining. My wife loved the ring light/mirror but wished it could go brighter. The toilet had a heated bidet seat, another nice touch. The cheap paper thin toilet paper however was out of place in a hotel like this. The king size bed was firm and relatively comfortable. My wife didn’t have any issues with it while I would wake up sore from pressure points on the hips. To be fair, I have a tempurpedic at home so it’s hard to get used to other beds. Bedding is a very subjective issue.The lobby, restaurant and splash pool are all on the 5th floor and if you use the parking garage the hotel elevators are on the 6th floor. There aren’t clear signs that tell you this and most people like us end taking a different set of elevators on the first try. It’s a bit confusing at first. Parking is $39/24hrs. There are no weekly discounts unfortunately. I think the hotel should have special rates for guests because $273 to park for a week is steep. Especially when you add on their “resort” fees. The location was just right for us. Right in the middle of everything. The beach is a 10-15 walk. Shopping all around. Kalakaua Ave has most of the high end shops and street performances. Lots of things to do and see.All in all I would highly recommend this hotel.","Calgary, Canada","Mohammad1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",14,4.0

The room is nicely designed with white color and modern glass shower, and that is all it offers. We are situated on a low floor overlooking the street with ice machine noises being constant as our room is right next to it. Service comes really late and the rooms are cleaned after 5 which means the room stays messy and towels don’t get replaced till the evening. This hotel somehow gets to call itself a resort but it is not. It really doesn’t offer anything like a resort. It just offers you a location in the middle of the upscale shopping district. There are many better options for same money where you can get a real adult pool and beach. The pool on pictures is just a very shallow one, fit for toddlers. You have to ask for everything which feels like you are begging to get an amenity that is included in your costs. For example a robe if available upon request. Everything is available upon request but they don’t make it known what is available to you. They give you for example $50 toward activities but that only applies to very expensive activities so you probably won’t use that. The worst part of staying here is that there is no balcony, no fresh air, the windows are inoperable and that is no way to spend your vacation in Hawaii. I will be more careful next time with the hotel to choose. ",,Momwkids22,18,3.0

My first impression was very positive as we took the elevator to the lobby and saw a well-appointed lobby with a wide open floor plan that spills out to the pool / patio area. They had fire pits going in the evening.There was live entertainment on Wednesday night (I found out they have it on Friday and Saturday as well). It was contemporary and I noticed that most of the crowd was made up of locals and not hotel guests. That should say something in itself.I had breakfast in the morning and appetizers for dinner in the evening. Food was excellent. My only nagative comment was that I ordered the breakfast buffet. I do not like a pot of scrambled eggs and asked if I could get 2 eggs over easy. I would have thought that this is reasonable for the $28 price tag with breakfast as most places actually have an omelet station. They gave me my eggs but there was an additional $6 charge. Just beware of this and ask before ordering. My room was spacious and had a nice view of the city. The room was modern and clean. There were plenty of outlets for my electronics. They offer a free water bottle which is nice as to not add to the pollution of plastic bottles. Even though there was a shower door water did spill out of the shower onto the floor. No big deal as long as you are careful getting out of the shower. Towels were changed every day and the room was kept clean.The pool is small but the hotel is near the beach. I am not sure if it would be a great place for a large family but I think it is perfect for business or a romantic getaway for 2.

He also booked her room right next to mine so if my grandmother needed anything I wouldn’t be to far away at all.. once I finally got her room she was brought to tears as she was so happy she was not even door down from me and all the balloons and cookies she received. Also a note saying “ Happy Birthday Grandma Janet, enjoy your 21st birthday at Hyatt Centric!” We all laughed and she couldn’t stop thanking me for this surprise. It was just so wonderful.

This is probably a gross over-simplification but in any case, we had to decide early on if we wanted to pick a hotel right on the beach or within walking distance. We decided the second type would be a better fit for our family and we were not disappointed, especially that all beaches in Hawaii are public beaches so beachfront hotels can't hog them. Our family of 4 fit comfortably in a Deluxe King size room with sofa bed. Here is in a nutshell what we liked and didn’t like about the Hyatt Centric:What we liked• New hotel• Modern Design• Boutique hotel vibe• Helpful staff• Well-appointed rooms with modern amenities such as plenty of USB outlets, Bluetooth speakers, Keurig coffee maker (good for tea too)• Oversize shower • Very quiet and effective AC (Air Con)• Great location • Easy 7-minute walk to the beach• Beach chairs and umbrellas available • Full blown Starbucks Reserve store on the ground floor• Lots of restaurants and shopping just outside the hotelWhat we didn’t like • No swimming pool (the one you see in the pictures is a 1-foot deep “wading” pool)• Hot tub temperature (doesn’t get warm)• $39/night for parking• $29/night for “resort” fee even though this is not a resort• Steep restaurant prices• Inconsistent happy hour menu (depends on live music schedule)• Sleep quality (mattress is too firm and some street noise)Overall, the Hyatt Centric Waikiki Beach is probably one of the better value on Waikiki but you have to watch out for extras (such as parking) which can add up really fast. We got by with Uber and Lyft whenever we wanted to explore the area outside of Waikiki, except for the one day we rented a car to drive to the North Shore (highly recommended). The location is great, close to the beaches, shopping and great restaurants. Providing beach equipment is a fantastic service and pretty much the only real value of the “resort fee”. We were able to borrow Tommy Bahama folding beach chairs (the ones you can strap to your back), umbrellas, towels and boogie boards daily. They also have some snorkeling gear and a few other items. Wonder why more hotels don't offer this? We enjoyed our stay enough to extend from 6 nights to 11 (we cancelled another reservation in a different hotel) but there are several annoying things that if they can be addressed by management, would make this hands down the best place to stay in Waikiki (if you don't have to be right on the beach)","Miami, Florida","RdRunr_7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",46,4.0

It just feels like deceptive advertising to me. We got stuck in Honolulu and the Hyatt looked like a good value until I got to the last page of the booking and found out about the extra$30/night resort fee, then not so much. However it turned out much better than I expected. I think we stayed in the worst room at the property and it was still great. Large, very well decorated, stylish, modern, also floor to ceiling windows with lots of light. It was the smallest room at the property, oddly shaped with alot of wasted space, and also on the lowest floor which is why I think it was the lowest price, nevertheless was very comfortable and the even with the wasted space still felt spacious. I’m guessing most of the rooms are much nicer, but ours was beautiful even at the low end. Nice bathroom and shower facilities. My one complaint is it was noisy, our room was street side and there was lots of traffic noise even with good, sealed windows. Also the air conditioner in this particular room was noisy. I use earplugs to sleep a lot so no problems for me, but if you’re noise sensitive this might be an issue. There’s an open lobby, bar, restaurant and sort of a pool at the reception area. It’s relatively small but has a good relaxing feel to it. We didn’t eat at then restaurant but it has good reviews. The pool isn’t really a pool more like a spa with a water feature for cooling off. You can’t swim and kids can’t do much more than splash but it will do a good job of cooling you off if you need it. On Friday an excellent live singer Tavano (I think.) performed don’t know if he’s here forever but his performance was great and inspired an enthusiastic audience. Much better than most of the live entertainment I’ve seen at most places in Waikiki. About the resort fee, this place is not a resort! But...they have umbrellas and beach chairs that are easy to carry to the beach, they’re surprisingly high quality and make for a leisurely day at the beach. Chairs have storage pockets for you sunscreen, glasses, key set, etc. and an insulated pocket you can use to keep things cold, with backpack straps to carry it all. Makes going to the beach pretty easy and the umbrella makes it so you can spend most of the day there in the shade. This is another good feature, a lot of people have flights that leave later in the day or even in the evening, checkout times are always at noon so they end up homeless for a few hours wondering what to do. The hotel stored our luggage and let us use the chairs/umbrella until the late afternoon even after we checked out so we had a nice way to spend the time until we actually had to leave. This was a great solution to a chronic problem. Staff was very helpful. Bell staff and doormen were especially helpful, couldn’t do enough for us.

The location is good (essentially one block away from Waikiki beach), wifi is fast for a hotel, the Expedia concierge was very helpful, and the restaurant stands out for its good food and sometimes excellent staff. There were several glaring problems for a 4-star hotel, though, namely:1. My travel companion was arriving before me, so I had called ahead to inform the front desk of this. My companion was not able to get the keys to the place for about one hour. The front desk person either arbitrarily decided to do so after an hour, or finally came upon the reservation note he originally claimed was not there. 2. There is one tiny trash can (by the toilet) in the entire hotel room. Would it have killed them to put two tiny trash cans in their hotel rooms? Maybe one in the living area?3. The guys at the front door are usually checking their cell phones and can't be bothered to hold the door for guests, much less ask if you need a cab.4. The hotel restaurant staff is either excellent or utterly incompetent depending on who you get.5. There is no minibar or room service menu!6. By far the worst aspect of the hotel is the housekeeping. On several occasions, I returned to the room in the late afternoon (after 4PM) and my room wasn't cleaned. I was told that the cleaners were still working through room. I left before 8AM on those days, by the way, so it's not like they didn't have hours to do so. During the entire 8-day stay, I don't think they changed my sheets once. Also, they would frequently leave trash in the room (empty food boxes, empty cans, hotel wine glasses from two days prior), and I would have to tell them to come back, and direct them to what is trash to be collected. This was by far the most frustrating part of my stay.Much better cleaning services, a more helpful front door staff, and an additional trash can would go a long way to improving the guest experience.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Arya A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",2,2.0

I was upgraded to a worse room and was told by Kaniela (sp?) that the room I originally reserved was not available (even though he told me it would be available when I returned from dinner that first night). The Front Desk service ranges from good/great (where is Erica?) to not so good (everyone else). I dread having to ask for or request any information via the Front Desk.Upon check-in, the wood desk in the king room had a sticky substance across the surface (I cleaned it) and right on the same wall as the desk, was a smashed bug with its entrails dripping down the wall. After housekeeping refreshed the room the next day, the bug was still there. Since the empty shower gel container was still in the shower, I'm guessing the shower wasn't cleaned, eitherl. I pointed out the smashed bug to Jackie, who removed the bug’s carcass, but the remnants of its entrails remained streaked on the wall. Gross. I'm guessing it's still there. It's clear (based on previous visits), no one is checking the room after it is serviced by the housekeeper. Hey someone: you might want to consider cleaning the carpet in 1711; very obvious and untreated stains. Filtered water stations (great idea) never seem to be operational. One or two are always broken at the same time. Decent hotel, but service remains an issue; and the lack of supervision of the housekeeping staff leads to the rooms looking used, old, and not particularly clean.

And the hot tub is almost the same temperature as the “pool”- so basically not a hot tub but it has bubbles to give it the appearance of a hot tub- disappointing. And I know every hotel has a resort fee- this one was $25 a day- but I don’t know if it is standard to have a tax on top of that fee. Parking (Valet) was ridiculously expensive-$39 a day. The resort fees and parking alone at the end of our 6 night stay ended up being about $400- I was not expecting this charge after already paying for the stay through Costco. I don’t think the stay was worth it for how much we paid. The bed was on the hard side- which I didn’t like and made my back hurt.

First, the hotel is only a block from the beach so you can get there almost as quickly as you would if you were staying at one of the beachfront properties and waiting for a high rise elevator, then walking through one of those huge lobbies to the sand. Even better, as you leave the front lobby at the Hyatt Centric, they will provide you with chairs, towels, boogie boards/sand toys, and umbrellas at no cost! We have stayed at many other hotels in Waikiki, even on the beach and almost every one of them charges for these things, so it is not to be overlooked the Hyatt is providing these complementary.More things I love about this Hyatt boutique hotel:Every staff member we encountered was courteous and willing to go the extra mile. I’m a tough critic when it comes to service and you can tell this hotel is under great leadership and management because every single person was there to please, with a smile.The hotel rooms are brand new and absolutely gorgeous. They are extremely well laid out with beach modern decor. The common areas, pool deck and restaurant are also refreshing, modern and new. The hotel has a very soothing and spa like feel throughout. Gym is small, as expected at a boutique hotel, but I love that it is located with floor-to-ceiling windows with a view! The restaurant offers a buffet or made to order option. Plenty of great choices. Many of the Waikiki buffets we’ve visited lack a ton of choices compared to the mainland. However we found this one to be one of the more comprehensive for the money.The pool deck is awesome and more of a sun soaking platform than dive-in and at all day type of pool. But, at the end of the day after the beach, the Jacuzzi is wonderful, or if you’re just looking for some quiet sun time and you don’t want to deal with sand on the beach, it is a perfect option. In the lobby there is also an inviting bar area with open windows to the outside which is a great place for a cocktail. Starbucks is on the bottom floor adjacent to the hotel.We stayed here with our family and loved the room layout. We had a king suite room which had the bedroom in the main area and then partitioned off with a closing door was a little living room with a pullout sofa where the kids could sleep.Cannot be happier with the location, and quality of this hotel. The friendly service was an added bonus. We would stay here again without second-guessing. We typically stay at the Hyatt Regency which is only a couple blocks away but overall I like this hotel better. It is less crowded and the newness is so refreshing - not a tired or outdated corner anywhere.

Had an awesome king bedded room with pullout sofa and living area (1507). Love the floor to ceiling windows and had a fun action packed view of Kuhio Ave and the mountains. Room was super spacious with many amenities: Keurig coffee maker, cell phone USB jacks in the nightstands, fridge, safe, and HUGE shower. A/C was ice cold (had to shut the vents at some point during the weekend) and it was super quiet in the hallways. Hot water came quick. Modern furniture, super sleek giant screen tv that pivoted to bedroom and living room, and had the best sleep all weekend (they even give you different types of pillows).There is a lot going on that is included with your stay: both nights we attended the nightly entertainment by the pool. There was happy hour drinks and appetizers with great prices and the night it dumped rain, the fire pit was a nice touch! The staff are super friendly from the valet guys (opened the doors EACH time without asking), to the front desk staff (love the cookies!) and the bartenders. The pool was nice and the always was able to get lounge chairs no problem,. Even though it's a splash pool, (3 feet at the deepest) it served it's purpose to cool off on the deck! Maybe put more loungers in the pool. We wished the ""bigger"" pool would have been warmer but I guess it's not a hot tub either. On Sunday, we took advantage of the Football Sunday all day happy hour and that was the bomb. All the appetizers were like $9 each and the beers $5. We stayed all morning to watch the game and it's probably the best price for watching the football games on Sundays in Waikiki. Great location in the heart of Waikiki and next to the new International Marketplace. To be honest we were enjoying the hotel so much we didn't even go to the beach (but hear the hotel lets you borrow beach chairs and towels for the beach).Had a great time, the food and drink were great (especially the prices) and the evening entertainment was awesome! The room even came with reusable water bottles to fill up at their britta stations. I also used the gym on two mornings, was the only person in there both times (6am) and I like that the excercyle has you cycling thru the villages of France on their screen! LOL. We didn't take advantage of the $22 bottomless Mimosas but will come back on another weekend to really enjoy (and early at that too!)Thanks Hyatt Centric for an awesome weekend!

For 4 out of 8 of the nights we stayed, the pool area was being used for private functions. Officially, we were told by staff that the pool ""wasn't closed"" and that we could still use it but to us that would be like gatecrashing - they were full on functions attended by a lot of people. After a long day shopping and walking around, all we wanted to do was soak in the spa, which we were unable to do. This spoilt part of the hotel experience for us and we had paid a lot of money for a once in a lifetime holiday to our dream destination. For the hotel to charge a resort fee, which is US$25 per night is a bit cheeky. It made us question - did we just pay for that event?

The main part of the view is facing Kuhio Avenue(see my pictures), which happens to have a bar that can get somewhat disturbing at night if you're a light sleeper. Consider that I was on the 18th floor , i was still able to hear fighting bar patrons outside on the street at 2 am...I found it funny that disposable earplugs were provided by the hotel when I first came to my room, but then I came to understood the reason why.Upon check-in , the front desk offered a $30 food and beverage credit if I chose to not have daily housekeeping.

I open the door and the room looks fine, Istart looking to see if I can find a complementary bottle of water but the only thing I can find are packs of earplugs ( I'm thinking thats nice because the trash trucks can be a little noisy at 4am in Waikiki, WRONG!!!!!

Bathroom is clean and well designed. Love the automatic sensors that turn on the night light!Each floor had ice machine and filtered water. Was also given 2 reusable bottles which was handy. Lobby had a great outdoor pool (although very shallow), and sunbeds. Great to relax after a day full of shopping.The location of the hotel is amazing; as soon as you walk out and turn left, it's the main boulevard with all the shops and the beach just a stone throw away. Valet parking was hit and miss, and on our last day, the valet service was terrible. I called the front desk up to complain, and was immediately re-imbursed of our valet fees.

The hotel is only an 8-minute walk from Waikiki Beach, the beach where surfing was created. This hotel has the feel of a luxury with a mid-range cost. You enter on the ground floor where there is a Starbucks Reserve. You take an elevator to the lobby where there is the Restaurant, Bar, Pool, and where you check in. Room: Expect plush beds with floor to ceiling views of either the City, Mountains, or Partial Ocean. I stayed in the King Room and it was larger than expected when you’re thinking of Waikiki hotels. I was graced with a soaking tub and bidet; little details truly can be the best part of trips. Two nightstands (with outlets) with rooms with a King-Sized Bed, very essential when you want to charge your phone next to their bed. You never notice this until you don’t have an outlet and your phone is charging on the opposite side of the room. Be Kind – all-natural bath products. The hotel gives you (2) Refillable Water Bottles in the room where there are multiple water fill up stations on the grounds. They are plastic, not glass, but still a step forward in sustainability! Entertainment/Hotel: Taimane Gardener plays every Wednesday on their rooftop. She is a local musician who was discovered by Don Ho while she was playing on the streets of Waikiki. She is a virtuoso ukulele player who defies all norms of the ukulele and its limits. Families are welcome, although the Hyatt Centric boasts an elegant and mature atmosphere, many barefooted kids danced around as the night continued. The pool is quaint however with less than 300 rooms and suites, you don’t need anything extraneous. Cabanas are perfect to hang out in after dark.Food/Dining: We dined at Hyatt Centric our first evening in Oahu, very impressive. Carefully curated dishes. Buffet breakfast is above average at the Lanai. I do not think I will ever forget the Lilikoi Bread Pudding. Phenomenal and genuine service with exceptional professionalism.Tip: Plan your stay at the Hyatt Centric in Waikiki around Taimane playing on Wednesdays. I promise you she is that great. Eat Dinner at The Lanai and move outside once finished. It’s the perfect Wednesday Waikiki evening. Would recommend for millennial-thinking travelers who are okay not being directly on the beach. Would not recommend for anyone that doesn’t want to walk or Uber to the beach. This being said, it really is only a short 10 Minute walk or even shorter Uber ride. The hotel is very hip and attracts trendy clientele of all ages, including families. 5-Star customer service from the entire staff. Would highly recommend with the utmost confidence.","St. Petersburg, Florida","Meghan F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Petersburg, Florida</strong>",11,5.0

I think the rating of TripAdvisors really misleading, & should not be rated so high for its class for the following reasons:1) It's a hotel converted from a business building, so no window can be opened. Why you come to Hawaii & stay inside an air-conditioned room2) Some people said the small & shallow pool area is an issue, however, I think the true issue is how the pool facing toward the sun. It gets so hot right from the morning, so u'll always find few people around3) The included breakfast is really basic & almost no change everyday. Only the local fruit included is good.4) The reason it has good review is that the hotel is really too new to have any bad review, in my opinionsHowever, I do want to share a few good things on the hotel:1) The service is good, all people are friendly2) The location is very central if you really want to be @ Waikiki beach3) Room is very modern & bathroom is very updatedIf you really wan to stay there, please ask for floor 20 above, as the view will then pays for itself.

The staff do not wait on you and apart from opening the door for you in the lobby that is the extent of interaction you can expect, which is completely acceptable given this is a hotel not a resort. The hotel does not have beach views, but is in close proximity to the beach. Our room was comfortable and spacious. The only minor criticism I would say is that it should be clarified in the hotel description that the pool is a ""lounge pool"" not a swimming pool. The common areas are quite small but again this is understandable being a city hotel.I did read another review which made a very good point that the hotel does charge a daily 'resort fee'...given that it is most definitely a hotel and not a resort I think this is a bit ridiculous. I did not question this when I booked or paid because I thought this was perhaps a typical charge associated with accommodation in Hawaii given we had paid a daily resort charge at the resort we stayed at in Maui prior to coming to Oahu, but now I feel a little naive. Our overall review was that you get what you pay for and the location of the hotel is good and it is good value for money.",,750gabbys,2,3.0

There was a pair of pants left in our room that belonged to a former guest (I assume), and the ""partial Ocean view"" we paid for required straining at the side of the window to be able to get a glimpse of a sliver of water. Truly the room faced an apartment building if you looked straight out the window (Seaside Ave). If you're sensitive to noise, we were on the 12th floor and I could hear the untz-untz of nightclub noise from Kuhio Ave. and the traffic below. Our first night we discovered there was only one coffee pod of ""real coffee"" provisioned and even though we booked for two guests.(There's a Starbucks on the main floor). I am a World Of Hyatt member, and really wanted to give this place five stars. The pool is merely an ankle wading pool, so if you're a swimmer, you may be disappointed.

I did not eat at the restaurant, but did have a few tasty cocktails from the bar. The service was impeccable and the drinks were delicious. The one criticism I read before I went that has some basis in reality related to the pool. The deepest part of the pool is 3 feet. Most of it is for show rather than use.

This former office building (from what I recall anyway) was very nicely refurbished into a modern and clean hotel with thoughtful design touches. I think there's a range of room sizes and layouts within the same rate class, so perhaps we got lucky. Anyway, it was a large, beautiful shower with a soaking tub that was fantastic after a long day of walking. The room was very spacious with floor to ceiling windows and a v. comfortable bed.When we first pulled up and began unloading our bags, though, the two valets at the front just kept talking to each other, and one only approached us after we had already unloaded to ask if he could help. Uh, really? This gave me a very poor first impression. The front desk person who checked us in couldn't be nicer, so then I thought the earlier experience was a one-off. Went downstairs for a happy hour drink, and the bartender was unbelievably grouchy and seemed irritated when I asked him for the happy hour specials and again when I ask to charge it to the room after which time I heard him tell someone else some system was down. He literally rolled his eyes at me, but that's my fault how? He could have just politely explained that and asked for alternate means of payment. Back to -1. For the rest of the weekend stay, though, everyone else, including (to be fair) that same bartender who said hi, good evening, etc. when we passed by the next day, were friendly and always asked how we were or if there was anything we needed. Even accounting for the occasional bad moods or days, though, I have to deduct one star for service overall. When we were leaving, the valets again didn't offer to help us with the bags. I've seen this same comment on other reviews, so I really think the hotel needs to address this. First impression and all...I would definitely stay again, though, because the accommodations were beautiful for a reasonable rate and the majority of employees who were otherwise friendly and service-oriented.

Near lots of shopping and restaurants. We were greeted with smiles and fresh squeezed pineapple juice. We arrived late morning, and I called ahead to see if it was possible to do an early check-in, and when we arrived, a lovely room was waiting for us. Clean, quiet, bright, with simple but pretty decor, modern white walls with warm wood furnishings. Our room, an ocean view with two queen beds, had large comfortable beds, a huge bathroom with both a gorgeous tub and a separate shower, and nice amenities. The major con, and the reason for only three stars, is that the ""pool"" is only three inches deep. Up to my ankles. Seriously! My kid said he'd stomped in puddles deeper than this. I mean why bother? It is not even a lap pool, more like a fountain. Other minor cons are that the ""ocean view"" is slices of ocean between big high rises, as the hotel is three blocks from the beach, and that the windows don't open. Still, the prices are reasonable for such a modern high quality hotel, and if you are looking for business or a more hip slightly urban take on Honolulu (and don't care about swimming), this could be your spot!

It looks like the finishing touches are not there yet. The touch up paint used in the bathroom, although still white, seems like a different paint. Very visible from the side that it is different, but not if looking directly at it. I like the idea of the water bottles that they provide, but not executed very well. First of all, the bottles whistles when you use it. Not good to use when my wife is sleeping as she is a light sleeper. Second, why are the water stations only on a few floors. If you are telling people that the bottles are being provided because they are better for the environment, won't your guests have to take the elevator (wasting electricity) to the few floors with the water stations? The bathroom only has one small hook to hang a towel. Most hotels want their guests to hang their towels up to reuse the towels, reducing the need to replace towels everyday. We use the towel holder on the shower door to hang the wet bath mat, so no place to hang towels if more than one person staying in the room. There is a whole blank wall in the bathroom that could be used to install a towel holder. A recycling bin in the room would also be good. There currently is only one garbage can in the entire room, by the toilet. If anybody is using the bathroom, you have no place to dump any garbage. Most hotels I've stayed at would have a garbage can by the desk, one by the bathroom sink, and possibly by the toilet. So I am a bit confused about their environment strategy. But overall a very nice hotel. Thanks to other TripAdvisor posts, I knew where to park, the Hyatt website doesn't tell you to enter the self-parking garage after the Ross and to park in the 6th floor. It just says that self-parking is available. ","Seattle, Washington","Braindead88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",0,4.0

I visited Hyatt Centric in June of 2017 and it definitely exceeded my expectations. This was my first visit to a Hyatt Centric. I have stayed at three Andaz properties and preferred this hotel to all three of them. I don’t quite understand Hyatt’s branding, as I assumed Hyatt Centric would fall below Andaz but, based on our experience at Hyatt Centric Waikiki, I would rank their brands as follows from best to worst: Park Hyatt, Hyatt Centric, Andaz, Grand Hyatt, Regency Regency. I would choose this hotel over the nearby Hyatt Regency on Kalakaua.Pros:-Excellent service. Front desk staff was wonderful and very responsive. Casual friendly vibe. They promptly responded to any requests by phone or text message. Love the option of text messages. Housekeeping staff was excellent and flexible-Stunning 8th floor lobby with pool area. Live music many nights.-Rooms are very nice with dramatic views of Honolulu on higher floors(see photos). We got upgraded to a suite so I’d be curious to know what the standard rooms are like-Excellent bed and linens-Excellent lighting (recessed lights on dimmers, which was a stark contrast to the Laylow next door, where your only two choices are ""Pitch black"" or ""brighter than a Target store""). Recessed lights on dimmers should be a requirement of all hotels.-Our suite had a separate zen sitting area with a huge round window. Nice place to chill while gazing out at the lights of Honolulu (see photos). It may have been a sofa bed (I never thought to check)-The room had two refillable sports bottles and there was a filtered water dispenser as well as an ice machines right across the hall to refill them. Very nice touch-Great restaurant with 24 hour room service. Fast room service delivery.-Second floor of building is one of the biggest and best Nordstrom Racks I have seen. Makes it very easy if you forget anything-Great location on much-improved Kuhio. Less than two blocks away from the new International Market Place and possibly the best food court on earthCons:-Hotel is located in a converted office building and it felt like it upon arrival. The valet staff didn't mention that the lobby was on the 8th floor so we weren't sure where to go until we asked. The only staff that was not very helpful or friendly were the valets-Because it’s a converted office building, the hotel does not have balconies or lanais or even windows that open. I think this was a big mistake on Hyatt’s part. It would make a huge difference if some windows at least opened for fresh air. After all, this is Hawaii. I understand now why it’s rare to see a commercial building converted to a hotel. The upside is unique floorplans and lots of recessed lighting; the downside is no outdoor areas and a somewhat confining feel.-If you are seeking a beachy resort, this isn’t it. I would describe it as an urban escape. I do not think this would be a particularly good choice for families with kids (same goes for the Laylow next door)Despite the lack of balconies, Hyatt Centric Waikiki is a wonderful new option in Waikiki that gets an A+ for effort and a 5 rating from me. Concept is well-executed, staff is exemplary.","Los Angeles, California","JJ72LA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",23,5.0

The guy (I forgot his name but he made me feel like lacks of experience) at front desk kept justifying it is their system issue (which means ok for customer?). Even after room cleaned, we found hair on the bed and pillow smells and they only put 1 glass in our room.

The hotel rooms were clean for the most part and a nice size. The shower had some mold growing in the bottom corners, but that is my only complaint about the cleanliness. We were originally put in a room that shares a wall with the elevator. I knew a few hours in after trying to take a nap that it was going to be an issue, especially since we were staying a week. The front desk staff was able to find a different room that was a little further from the elevator which helped a lot. The new room also had a partial ocean view. If you are able to I would recommend requesting a room away from the elevators on a high floor to avoid noise. I wouldn't pay extra for the ocean view. It was nice, but you basically get to see a small section of it between buildings. We didn't use the pool, but it looked fairly nice. It attracts a lot of families with kids. Probably because it's shallow so a good place for young ones to play in the water. We went to the bar once during our visit. I don't remember who our bartender was, but he wasn't very friendly and the drinks were more expensive than anywhere else we went. We ended up spending time at another hotel's bar. The location was ok. It is about a block away from a nice shopping area and if you walk through it then you can get to the beach on the other side. There is also another alley you can use a little down the street to get to a public part of the beach. There is a Ross and an ABC store next door which was convenient for picking up a couple of items we needed. The shopping center had a nicer ABC store though so I ended up going there more. Next time I may be willing to pay more for a hotel on the beach. If you are looking for a hotel where you can walk outside and be on the beach or that has more of a resort feel then this isn't the place for you.

This was a 3-night stay and I reserved 2 rooms. I had the king suite and my companion had a king room; both had views to the ocean. It’s an obstructed view (i.e., the view is blocked by other buildings) so if want to save money, you might opt for the city view or Diamond Head view.King suite: I didn’t like my 2-room suite. The bedroom space was fine, but lacked sufficient natural light. The window is above the bed, but it’s a long, wide rectangle that’s not very big. The bedroom room had sufficient storage space for one person (two would be challenging) and the bed was a bit too soft for me. The living space left a lot to be desired. Even though the view looks toward the ocean, there wasn’t a lot of natural light coming in through the windows. The space is very small and contains a sofa (very uncomfortable), chair (small), table for the TV, and another low table (the finish had visible water damage). As you enter the living space, the floor slopes down. There is no desk at all in this room so getting any laptop work had to be done using the low table and the sofa. It killed my back! (I was told that none or most of the suites did not have a desk.) The bathroom had a newfangled toilet (i.e., the kind that washes your bottom with the push of one of several buttons). The enclosed shower (which I liked) also included a tub (which I didn’t use – who uses a tub when they travel?). The vanity had sufficient counter space. The Keurig coffer maker was located at the correct height so it was easily accessible in the king suit. (This statement will make sense in the next paragraph.)King room: This was a much better room. Much better natural light, much better use of space (open with very little unnecessary furniture), and it had a desk (albeit a small, narrow desk, but a desk none the less). The enclosed shower did not have a tub and it had a standard toilet. The storage space was in issue (not much of it) and the location of the Keurig coffee maker was weird. It was on a slide out shelf in the armoire, but it was too high. I’m fairly tall, but even I had to stretch to ensure I had the correct water level. If you’re of modest stature, you’ll have to use a chair or move the coffee maker to the desk. Overall, however, this king room was a much more comfortable room than my king suite.Service: Check-in by Erica was great. She was gracious, upbeat attitude, and helpful. Subsequent visits to the Front Desk were good experiences except for once. I’ll be sexist: men/young men make the worst Front Desk attendants. Ask a man/young man a question and you often get “no” with no alternatives/options or a deer in the headlight look. Usually not helpful. That said, some of the men/young men here were good. There was one (whose name I did not get) who was rude and consequently, unhelpful. Excellent service by the waitpersons on breakfast days 2 and 3; and lunch on day 1. Again, I didn’t get their names (apologies!), but they were quite good. Service by the downstairs Front Door attendants ranged from good to very good. I didn’t know they provided beach towels, but a young lady at the Front Door mentioned it and that was a plus since we didn’t travel with beach towels.Parking: Self-parking here is the challenge. Very tight and narrow ramps, but I was not OK with the very tight parking spaces. Be advised that the parking garage is not operated by Hyatt and as with most (if not all) hotels, it’s a subcontracted service. Hence, the rules/requirements are not always obvious. Each time you enter the garage, you have to take a ticket, but no one tells you that you need to keep the parking ticket each and every time you exit the garage. The rude guy at the parking attendant booth threatened to charge me the higher rate if I didn’t have the parking ticket “the next time you come out.” He was rude, but I let it go. I’m guessing he hates his job and he’s burned out with tourists. :-)Others have commented about the small pool. I never use a hotel pool so I don’t have anything to offer regarding the pool. Besides, if you need that pool experience with someone hoovering and serving you all the time, this probably isn’t the hotel you want. Others have also commented/complained about the location of the hotel in relation to the beach. Good grief! The hotel is not that far from the beach. You can walk there in 10 minutes! :-) If you want to be ON the beach, then you might want to select a different hotel. Does noise filter up from the street? I don’t know since I was on the 20th floor, but keep in mind the location: It’s off Kuhio Ave. (a busy street) and not far from the very busy Kalakaua Ave. Overall, the hotel is fine. Though, I would probably pass on getting a suite. (Well, at least the one I had, [room 2009]). If you’re looking for luxury or upscale, this isn’t it. But if you’re looking for a newish hotel with acceptable amenities and better than average service, the Hyatt Centric Waikiki fits the bill. Who knows what it will look like when the newness wears off and its seen too many tourists, but for right now, it’s a good hotel. It certainly scored well on service during this visit.","San Francisco, California","Apollo P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",154,4.0

The two things we liked about the hotel were the location and the size of the king size bed room we were given.The hotel is located very close to Waikiki beach, only a few minutes walk. There are plenty of stores for shopping around the hotel as well as restaurants. Very convenient if you want to be in the center of life at Waikiki. Our room on the 12th floor was a very good size and it felt and seemed new. We enjoyed the spaciousness of it, the bathroom was also spacious. Why then give it an average rating? The room was spacious but it was noisy especially at night. When we arrived in the room my wife noticed that the hotel room came with complimentary ear plugs. We thought it was cute at the time but when we went to bed at night we realised that it was no joke. The noise from Kuhio avenue that the room was facing warranted ear plugs. So, spacious room but very noisy at night.The other point that we found average was that the pool is relatively shallow and not a real swimming pool (as in being able to swim and do laps). To note: as we live in Asia, we are spoiled for choices when it comes to four or five star hotels. The room prices of Hyatt Centric are five star superior room Asia equivalent but the hotel does not feel like it is of that standard. Overall it is a centrally located, spacious rooms, clean hotel. Not a five star luxury property but efficient and good for a short stay (if you don't mind the noise).",Singapore,"Sito_Journey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",36,3.0

I had just spent 5 nights in Maui, and needed 1 night here. I wanted it close if not on the infamous beach, new or remodeled, and affordable, well THIS IS IT! HOTEL: The property itself is not new, but Hyatt has renovated it and opened recently this Centric brand property. I'm estimating from memory here, but I want to say it's 28 floors or thereabouts. It is a mid rise building with stellar location. Inside ground floor, elevator up 1 level to check in, this is also where the bar/lounge and beautiful pool deck are. During my stay there was a beautiful Hawaiian artist singing from about 5-8 and with its location the streets are alive, especially from say 4p to 10p.THE LOCATION: As stated above, the location of this property is excellent. The only thing better might be one of the Hotels right on the beach, but the walk is a nice one, and one should get out and experience wherever they stay anyhow.Its about 5-10 minutes to Waikiki Beach itself. This property is surrounded by all kinds of shopping and restaurants. Excellent Asian Cuisine in Honolulu ;-)For those using UBER in Honolulu, please know that they have an arrangement with the local taxi's, not all of them, but some, and for that reason they are not the best option here. Use Lyft instead as they are their own drivers.The Missouri Memorial is about 15 minutes or more depending on traffic, and the airport a bit further. Diamondhead by car is 5-10mins, and can also be reached by foot.THE ROOM(S): I can understand the frustration of the one who just posted , if all the rooms are not of the same size. I doubt there is a huge difference however, and it would have to do with the former life of this property.I found my room, a Double on a top floor to be exactly what I needed, and you cant beat that it feels brand new being it was just created. Excellent opportunity for views of the city as well so be sure to ask if its possible. The front desk I found to be very accommodating.THE STAFF: I did not deal with too many people for this stay but the Sales support team was fantastic to work with and they clearly wanted my business, more than I can say for Marriott teams right now, guess what, they got it, and Marriott did not. Again as stated above from the greeting at the lobby doors, to the Front desk, to the Bar staff, and Maids, everyone was cheerful and accommodating. Was my Elite recognized? I am not yet Elite with HyattI would absolutely recommend this property. It was $150-200 cheaper than staying on the beach, and prices are insane in Honolulu. Save yourself money for everything else and stay here, especially if your stay is short, you wont regret it.","Boca Grande, Florida","MarcusBeier</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boca Grande, Florida</strong>",108,5.0

Please note you must go to the 6th floor level to actually get to the hotel elevators. Once you get inside the posh lobby, it is very nice. You may ask where is the restaurant, well, you have to look carefully and begin to take 25 paces before you realize if you are near the pool, you are near or in the restaurant.

It look like the pictures depicted. I called down to the front desk to see if there were other King size bedrooms that were bigger. A gentlemen informed me that there are different size rooms. He explained that Expedia puts pictures up that don't always represent the true picture. That's false advertisement to me. I asked if there was another room bigger available, we were willing to pay any difference. The gentlemen told me there was not. So I go down to the bar (the bartender was excellent) and a young lady, who had just checked in, tells her companion ""they just upgraded us to a suite""! I am so confused because I thought there weren't any more rooms.

Clean rooms. New hotel. Great location in Waikiki, in walking distance to the beach, shopping and many dining options. We rented a car for one day, which saved on the expense of the parking garage or valet parking. The parking fee for the hotel is the same fee all over Waikiki. We booked 3 different tours, which they pick up and drop off, so there is little reason to rent a car for an entire vacation. Renting as needed is a much better option. I was surprised by the pool, only 14 inches deep but I don't feel this took away from our trip. Upon check out, there was a problem with our bill- Delta Vacations didn't provide them with all the information that we had paid all fees, including the daily resort fee. Kaniala was so helpful , he allowed our room bill to stay open until we could get back home and have time to call Delta Vacations. Once we were home, Delta Vacations called the hotel and cleared the balance with them directly. The one suggestion I do have for the hotel, is there needs to be additional trash cans in the room. We had one small trash can in the bathroom, but it was continually over flowing because we are a family of 4.

We has beautiful views across Waikiki Beach- The hotel decor is modern but with a touch of Hawaiian charm. Our room was very spacious and the bed was extremely comfortable. The hotel has only been open about 6 months. Being so new is a really nice change from a lot of older hotels that are in Waikiki.- The pool area is a little on the small side however we always were able to find a lounger and spent most afternoons there- The service at the pool and bar was fantastic. We really enjoyed happy hour and the live music in the evenings- The hotel location is perfect. There is a Starbucks right downstairs, Nordstrom Rack and the International Market Place (with the amazing new foodcourt) a few doors down and the beach less than 5 mins walk away- The staff on the front door were possibly the nicest and friendliest hotel staff we have ever encountered.- For what you get the price is excellent - We really enjoyed that although it is a Hyatt it is reasonably small and has got a boutique type feel to it.When booking this hotel I read extensive reviews and was a little concerned about two things 1) having no balcony and 2) the pool depth. As it turns out having no balcony was no issue at all - the floor to ceiling windows more than made up for it and we spent most of our time at the poor and bar anyway. The pool was also not any issue at all. It is actually separated into 3 parts - the middle is only ankle deep, one end is about 1 foot deep and the other end is essentially a jacuzzi (although bigger and not hot)which is about 3 feet deep with seating all around the edge. We swum everyday and were more than refreshed in the far end of the pool, we did not miss having something deeper at all. My only comment would be that at times there were kids splashing around and because it was quite small it could be a bit annoying - it would be nice to make that section of the pool adults only.You will not be disappointed if you book this hotel. Next time we go back to Waikiki we will 100% be staying here.","Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand","Nicola W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",9,5.0

Wow! The design is so beautiful and our view of the ocean was sensational. Being a little back from the main strip we didn't think our view would be that great but it was better than expected and we actually enjoyed the fact it was not directly in the hustle and bustle but still close enough to all the action.The friendly staff, the design and little touches of this hotel just topped off the end to our holiday and made us want to stay longer so thank you Hyatt Centric Waikiki!

Booked an ocean view room with 2 queen beds for a 5 night stay over memorial day weekend (which is not enough time!) Was quite dissappointed when we checked in and did not have the double sink as pictured on the booking sites which they said is indeed a part of this category room but unfortunately they were all booked. They should allow this specification to be selected when booking if not all the rooms have the double sink as pictured because we are 2 girls and need a lot of counter space and expected that to be a part of the room. We also found the closet space to be very limited, but we were determined to enjoy ourselves from the time we arrived and made it work instead of waiting to switch rooms. Room could use more garbage bins, we only had 1 in the bathroom, needed 1 in the mainroom as well since my friend was constantly throwing out food containers that would make the bathroom smell. ""Ocean view"" was very limited and distant, but did get a nice view of the pool and the lights of the city looked lovely at night. Could also see people on the main street moving around to engage in nightlife. The beds were dense and plush and very comfortable, as well as the robes. Room was always clean. Room service menu is on the tv which is cool and convenient. Upon arrival we devoured almost half of the poolside menu as we were so hungry after our 12+ hours of traveling. Enjoyed the poke, rainbow tartar, ribs, and the chocolate cake smore with ice cream was good too. Room service was disappointing. First it arrives in a brown bag as if its take out, which does not seem to match the standards of this hotel which has otherwise good attention to design details and aesthetics when you see the nice lobby and poolside dining space. They should upgrade the room service experience by delivering it on rolling trays on proper plates like most other hotels. The fish entree we ordered that comes on rice with a side of I think fennel was also underwhelming, which was surpising because it looks so good in the elevator pictures but I would advise you skip it. The shrimp sandwhich I had a couple times was pretty good, never had a pattie made out of shrimps and its a great idea, just wish it came with some kind of sauce or spice on the sandwhich cause its missing just a hint of flavor. Request ketchup with your order and its flavorful and satisfying. For breakfast we often ordered the egg white omlettes which were good, only problem is they came drenched in oil, to a noticably unnecessary and excessive level. The cooking staff should scale back a bit on that and try to cook the omlettes a little dryer. 0% greek yogurt would be a great addition as well. The gym was small and limited but sufficient and has towels, a scale, city views, and brita water station. Appreciated the orange water bottles in our room that we were able to regularly refill at the water stations, just wish there were a few more water stations available on each floor. We were on 11 and I would constantly have to go up to 19 to refill, which became a problem when that machine was broken because thats also were the ice machine is, so I would go up to 19 for ice then go down to 7, the main floor, to fill up on water. Even though the elevators were usually fast, thats a lot of hustle when you are trying to relax and be on hawaiian time. Although it is not beach front, so glad I chose this newer hotel for our girls trip as the existing waikiki beachfront room options looked so old and tired and were much more expensive. Thanks to it being well located a few blocks directly behind the Royal Hawaiian, we really didnt miss anything. In just a few blocks, maybe an 8/10 minute stroll, we were on waikiki beach and it was nice to pass through the shopping area and nice decor such as the alley of surfboards coming from that side of the beach, that we may have missed if we were staying directly on it. Also on your way out of the hotel, you can ask the staff for as many beach towels, beach chairs and umbrellas as youd like to borrow and just return them on your way back. They also offer sunblock. Just a reminder, as stated in other reviews, the pool is more for show than for swimming, it is just about 4 inches deep and there were actually a lot of families with kids there while we visitied so the kids were the only ones really enjoying the pool, adults just came out to lounge poolside and get their tan and drinks on. I saw a couple that was being romantic with each other, but getting annoyed that kids were splashing in the jacuzzi with them and ruinning the relax vibe. They eventually got fed up and left. Maybe there should be a sign that limits the kids to the regular pool area and leaves the jacuzzi area for the adults to have something to themselves, cause I guess some parents dont have enough awareness and consideration to pull their kids away from adults clearly engaging in intimacy and leisure amoungst themselves. Because of this, I would not recommend this place for couples and honeymooners, unless you dont plan on spending much time by the pool. Everywhere else was pretty peaceful and kid free.As far as Oahu, definitely rent a car to get out to Lanikai beach and some of the beaches on the northshore, as well as try some great local eats around the island, particular fresh poke from foodland, teds haupia pie, and portugese doughnuts from Leonard's. But right in waikiki theres the fresh fruit shaved ice stand in front of the royal hawaiian shopping center, and the calimari and fish tacos at Dukes were yum, both right down the street from the hyatt centric hotel. So the hotel location was good, as most things in the area we visited by foot or a short taxi ride (like the bar at The Modern and Al Moana beach), but the stand out is the great friendly staff and service. From the front door, to the front desk, to the bar, to the pool, everyone always seemed very happy kind and happy to help or be of service, which seems to be the disposition of hawaiian people in general, throughout the island just lots of lovely, kind, chill people. Shout out to Kani (hope I got your name right :-) who I often had nice converstion with as he would genuinely ask how my days were going and he and his colleagues would give great recommendations of what restaurants and bar/lounges to check out. Only thing is there seemed to be a female manager that often seemed to be talking to the staff a little harshly, like being too hard on them just an observation of what i saw a few times from a distance, and there was just a noticeable different energy from her versus the rest of the staff, she seemed very tense in the little bit of exchange we had with her but maybe it was just these few instances. Overall they are doing a great job managing the service and just need to make small adjustments to their food prep and room service as well as their clarity in booking rooms as pictured. Pricing along with location and service makes it a great value. Will not hesitate to stay here again whenever visiting Honolulu.","New York City, New York","FlyGirlNYC3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",68,4.0

It's right next to the main shopping streets of Waikiki, and It's maybe around 5 to 10 minutes walk to Waikiki beach.Amenities were as expected from a well known hotel brand, though I felt cheated by the ""hidden"" resort fees (my first experience with this American ""resort fee"" culture). In most other hotels I've stayed in Asia, Australia or Europe, they don't have this ""hidden"" cost, and the use of the facilities was included with the original price, so I never felt cheated.

I gave the 4-star rating because I couldn't find anything that dramatic to complain about. In our group, were my husband, myself and my 7 year old son so the room was adequate for our stay. We stayed in the double queen bed room with a huge bathroom, separate Rainfall showers, Deep soaking tub (my sons favorite) and toilet areas. Floor to ceiling windows in the room. Mini refrigerators, Keurig coffee maker (with coffee and tea), in-room safe, Hooded bathrobes, free Wi-Fi, Air-conditioning is not as cold as we would've of liked it. There's only (1) tiny trash bin in the bathroom but, we had extra grocery bags to make our own trash collection. On the 2nd night the TV didn't go on, called front desk and the repair man came in 10 min. Awesome Customer Service. Food was okay, too pricey for the quantity of food given. I had the ""Kanak Attack Breakfast"" and believe me when you say Kanak Attack, I'm believing it would be a ""huge portion"" for $17 but the serving size was small and the price should have been in the $11 range. I absolutely loved the key card system. Valet people are so accommodating, my husband forgot a few items in the car, they offered to get it for us and bring up to our room, not once but twice during our stay. That's what you call the ""Aloha"" spirit. I must say check-in was great, she was the supervisor, I feel bad I don't remember her name. She explained everything from the free reusable water bottles in the rooms, filtration water fill up on the different floors to the pool and lanai areas. The lobby is inviting and comfortable. The staff is super courteous. Just be informed that the pool is a wading pool, the deepest I believe is 3 feet. It was perfect for our grand babies and our (7) year old son. It was walking distance from most of the surrounding popular restaurants and beach. Especially the newly renovated International Market Place. It's a place we'll visit again.

My company likes me to be close by to the clients. Since they got me a room at one of the newer hotels in Waikiki, I obliged. It's a converted office building to hotel. Some may say that it has no real lobby (it's not on the ground floor but on the 7th floor) but I think it's totally fine as it keep the riff raff from Waikiki out of the hotel. The ""lite"" lobby is all the rage at most new hotels so it's fine. I had a king size room with a view of another tall building (19th floor)Since I'm sure we were getting a great rate it was fine by me since I was only going to be sleeping overnight. Acoustics were pretty good as I didn't really hear the garbage trucks that roll into Waikiki at 4am. A/C was nice and cold.My room was pretty nice, big comfy bed with nice linen and nice new modern look (not the tropical look that many hotels try to do. Super nice pillows. Bathroom was big (shower had nice pressure) and the bathroom amenities quite nice.) Nice floor to ceiling windows but I recommend if you want to take advantage, get a room with ocean view or mountain view. The breakfast buffet was pretty good, I especially like the healthy options of the local pineapples and papaya! Since the lobby is actually on the 7th floor, it's pretty quiet for being in the middle of Waikiki. Sat at the ""pool"" but be advised that it's more of a ""soaking"" pool when the day get hot or the trade winds stop blowing and you need to get your body wet. It's definitely not a ""swimming"" pool but good enough to go in and cool down.What I liked the most about the hotel (apart of it being brand spanking new) is that from 5pm-6pm they have local cultural workshops (lauhala weaving, petroglyphs reading, Hawaiian tattoo designs, conch blowing. etc) It definitely beats the other kitchy stuff that other hotels do. All the staff I ran into seemed pretty nice and friendly. Overall, I like the Hyatt Centric hotel, new modern and not over the top. A good, solid, modern hotel with nice amenities, close to everything since it's in the heart of Waikiki but quiet enough to not have to feel like you are in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.

I've stayed there a couple of times now, and while it's still a work in progress, the hotel is a good addition to what currently available in Waikiki. The rooms are well appointed. On my first stay I used a suite upgrade certificate and was given a very nice high floor suite with views in two directions; towards Diamond Head from the bedroom and the Royal Hawaiian and the Pacific from the living area. The shower was huge and had a glass wall that looked into the living area. (I'm not sure why designers think this is a good thing!?) On my second stay I had a regular room and was assigned one on the Seaside Avenue side of the building looking directly into the apartments across the street. This led to having the drapes closed most of the time which isn't really desirable when you're in Hawaii. I found it odd that in both rooms there was no desk. I realize that for the most part guests are on vacation, but some of us are there for work, and having a desk is essential.On both stays the restaurant was empty at breakfast time, and on both occasions the server told me the buffet was not available because the occupancy rate wasn't high enough to warrant it. The breakfasts were well prepared and the service good. I think the restaurant is still finding its feet a bit, and being on the 7th floor, no one on the street would really know it's up there.The hotel is still getting settled, but it's in a good location - a short walk to the new International Market Place, and just a block off the main drag of Kalakaua Avenue.

The water knob was also located behind the shower door, meaning you had to step in to the shower to turn on the water making it a bad design. Definitely not deal breakers, but like I said, they missed a good opportunity to really stand out.We had breakfast both mornings in the hotel restaurant and thought the food was fabulous – great flavor combinations. We had happy hour one night at the bar and that food was good there too. We poked our heads in to the fitness center, which is entirely way too small (not enough equipment) for that size of hotel. And the “pool” was for show only – it’s literally only nine inches deep. Overall it’s a nice hotel and we’d gladly stay there again upon return to the area.","Seattle, Washington","Beth K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",64,4.0

Got to the check-in counter where I was greeted wonderfully by the hotel staffer named Erica. She could not have been more helpful or more wonderful. Upon learning it was my 50th birthday she gave us a room upgrade. She also offered us fresh squeeze pineapple juice which my husband never had and it blew his mind.

The room itself was clean and modern but a little on the small side. We were upgraded to a room on a high floor and had a nice view looking out towards the beach. Also, I was in the room one morning when there was a slight tap on the door before it opened and one of the hotel staff explained they had thought we checked out and quickly apologised. There is a nightclub across the road that goes until all hours of the night and the music is extremely loud. We did not hear it from our room because we were on such a high floor facing the opposite direction but I think this may be an issue from some rooms.Also, the parking is $32 per night to self park and $37 per night for valet. We only had a car for 1 night and had planned to leave the hotel early the following morning to hike Diamond Head. We seen a sign at the parking garage that if you entered after 5pm and exited before 6am it was only $15 so we did that. Overall, the staff made our stay enjoyable but I would probably spend a bit more money next time to stay somewhere with a proper pool.

Stayed here for 4 nights, (writing this the day I am back home). The hospitality was amazing they treated us like family and every time I walked into the lobby they always spoke to us, not once were we ever ignored. Everyone remembered us geez and let me get to the door people, every time we walked in and out they opened the doors for us to walk out EVERY SINGLE TIME WITHOUT ASKING, it's the small things that count to us. Everyone in the staff is amazing smiled and always spoke to us. We will definitely not hesistate on coming back and staying here. We enjoyed the lounge pool with the jets, and my mother loved the small gym as she's into fitness. They had great breakfast at the restaurant it delicious! Their pastries are like none I've ever had before! All in all I give them 5/5 stars ✨! They were truly their to help us and even offered help with anything which amazed me the staff was always telling us if you ever need help ask us we are locals, they recommended us best places to eat (other hotels don't they want you to eat at theirs or partners) but these guys truly want you to experience Hawaii! Location is key right in between the beach and stores! All you need within minutes of walking. My father had a bad knee while here due to recovery of recent accident but managed to walk every without any hassle which was good as we weren't far from anything. Gotta admit there is some noise from outside there's a club and lots of stores but I can't complain it's the city! There's always noise in the city I was able to sleep so I was set. But in all honesty I'm pretty sure it's much more quiet than being right on the beach or right next to all those shopping plazas with restaurants pretty sure that's much more louder.

The location is fabulous on an inner street, away from the crowds but not so far away that you couldn't get to shopping or food in a few minutes.

Whenever I go on vacation, I always stay at Hyatts. I've been a hyatt rewards member for years. I normally only stay at category 4+ Hyatts. I decided to try this new hyatt out since it's a new hotel and the theme is pretty cool. Let's just say that this hyatt has a lot of things it needs to figure out before it can charge the price it charges and come out with happy customers. There were so many little things they missed. If you don't normally stay at nice hotels, you will probably love this place and not notice. But if you frequently stay at Grand Hyatts or Hyatt Regencies in big cities (especially in asia) you will be very disappointed. I hurts me to leave a bad review for hyatt because I really do like this chain a lot, but I thought this could be used as constructive criticism and a headsup for new travelers who are not as familiar with hotel chains. The rooms start at floor 7. Floors 1-6 is parking and floor 8 is the lobby, restaurant, and fake pool. Things that bothered us: - $32 for self parking. in a terrible terrible garage. This garage is like an obstacle course. It's very poorly designed and many people have hit the sides trying to drive up the ramps. If there's a better alternative around (there probably is for cheaper) STAY THERE. You also have to use your roomkey to badge into the parking garage floor. This makes no sense since the garage also serves as parking for nordstrom rack so it's not exactly a private garage! - resort fee?! for what? the pool is not a real pool, it's about 1-3inches deep. Even kids were complaining it's too small. There's no spa. There's 1 restaurant. The fitness room is a joke. What resort are we talking about here? I've seen non-resort hyatts with better facilities. How do they justify that resort fee? - The cleaner clearly did not vacuum on some days. I know we're not the cleanest, but we're not the messiest either. When we're paying $200-300 a night for a hotel room, we expect the floors vacuumed. - the check-in process was painful. This isn't really the hotels' fault as we did arrive at 2:30pm but normally hyatts have always accommodated my early check-in. even when i get there around 11am. I was surprised to find this one wasn't. Oh they also don't have a regency lounge so you're stuck hanging out by the fake pool or something. -__- I don't think hotel is fully booked for the weekend we were in honolulu so this is surprising. - The check-out process was painful. I didn't receive a 'checkout online' email like I normally do for hyatts. I tried waiting in line to check out but I couldn't wait because of my flight. One of the staff asked for my room number and told me he'd check me out. HE didn't. He forgot =( I called back later in the day to find that I wasn't checked out yet! How do you forget?! I was the only person in line and the original staff person was finishing up with his last customer. I don't understand how you can make this mistake when you're trying to be a high-end ""resort"" hotel. - I ordered an acai bowl from the restaurant. When my bf went to pick it up after 10 minutes, they made him wait another 10 minutes. at which points the bowl was completely melted. it was acai juice. I called down to tell them what happened. At first they were very apologetic and told me they'll remake it. - they called back after 5 minutes to tell me ""that's how an acai bowl is suppose to be"" It's pretty liquid. No. it's very clear that the bottom portion was still somewhat smoothy-like but the rest was 100% juice. They were nice enough to take the bowl of juice off of my bill, but this is pretty unacceptable. I tossed the juice out. All in all, as you can see the hotel was fine. it's the attention to detail that bothered us at the price point they are going at. If they were cheaper, say ~$150/night all inclusive I think a lot of these things would be more acceptable. i think they are a newer hotel so they have a lot of kinks they need to work through before it's worth staying at. I'd recommend staying at the Grand Hyatt a couple blocks away over the hyatt centric if you're still thinking hyatt. They have a spa and a real pool. The room itself was pretty spacious and the view was really nice so no complaints there. and outlets everywhere!!! always a plus :) Side note: A hotel like hyatt centric or andaz could really consider a partnership with amazon echo or google home :P","San Francisco, United States","Mengying Z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, United States</strong>",4,3.0

Another perk was that they provide beach towels and Tommy Bahama chairs to take to the beach (about 3 blocks away). On one rainy evening we ate in the restaurant there too and it was a fabulous meal!

This is a brand new modern hotel steps away from all the high end stores on Kalakaua Ave which we nicknamed Rodeo Dr. because it felt as if we were in Beverly Hills for a moment. Negatives:1. the beach is approx 2.5 blocks away, and we suggest walking through the pink hotels lobby (Royal Hawaiian) as a short cut. You have to ask for beach chairs and umbrellas from the 1st floor street entrance of Hyatt Centric early. The first day we went to the beach they were all out of umbrellas so we had to rent an umbrella from the Royal Hawaiian Hotel $40 for the day. 2. The pool at the hotel is not a swimming pool just enough water to put your feet in, if the plunge pool was heated it would've made up for the lounge pool 3. Charge for self parking is $32 per day4. Ocean view rooms are not full view just a peak between buildings. I would suggest not paying any extra for ocean view 5. Housekeeping cleaned half our room and was there late in the day Positives:1. Comfortable, clean and spacious rooms2. The staff were all friendly especially Malia who reserved our chairs and umbrellas for the beach the 2nd day3. Fire pit and plenty seating around next to the wadding pool4. Keurig in the room with coffee and tea k-cups5. Definitely a great location for vacationers that like to shop, plenty of restaurants in walking distance. We would recommend this hotel to someone who require a clean and modern hotel room however does not require a great view or a swimming pool.

The building which houses Hyatt Centric used to be an office block. The rooms are an excellent size and bathrooms well designed. The lobby, restaurant and wading pool area have a relaxing vibe and a nice boutique feel. All the staff were friendly from reception to bell desk. We upgraded to a King Suite which was huge. There is only 1 negative and that is the music which carries up from the street on a Friday and Saturday night from the Bar diagonally opposite. We were moved from level 10 to 17 and could still hear it. That was our first 2 nights of our stay. Fortunately for the rest of our stay it was not noisy. There's a Starbucks Reserve which literally opened on the day we arrived a new upmarket concept which comes in on par now with the great coffee we are used to in Australia. The Reserve coffee is other blends from around the World and they have press, drip or siphon methods too.... more of an experience. Thanks Hyatt Centric for a great stay. We wish we were staying with you for our full vacation however are off to the Modern Hotel.

However, there was lots of issue during my stay.I had tried to book with them over the phone initially because I didn't want to get stuck with a room that I would've been unhappy with. I didn't know which hotel rooms had tubs and etc. I couldn't get a hold of them - might have been an issue on my end so I just ended booking on Expedia instead. The checking in process felt like I was at Motel 8 or something - Wesley had asked us if we were celebrating anything and I told him that it was my birthday weekend and his was response was just ""oh"". Why bother asking in the first place if you don't care?The room that they had put us in was extremely lacklustre and I had the view of the hotel boilers. I had called down to front desk and Wesley that had checked me in insisted that they were completely booked...well that is until I told him that I would just like to cancel my stay completely. The toilet in that room was also dirty...which grossed me out.He had moved us to another room on a higher floor but it was half the size so I decided to stay in the original room. He had advised me to come down the next morning to ask about switching to a higher room when people are checking out. The front desk agent once again did the same dance and song in regards to being completely sold out. I just didn't have the energy anymore to try to get onto a higher floor.The room cleaners in the hotel was completely spotty - no one cleaned our room mirror for 4 days. The wood floors by the doors were also dusty at times - I don't think that they have a complete check list. I don't blame this on the housekeepers, this is something that management should be taken care of and properly trained the housekeepers. I also called into the front desk on one morning to have our room cleaned while we went for breakfast, sure enough no one came by despite my call to the front desk. Finally the last day, there was this middle aged male housekeeper that had cleaned our room and he had done an amazing job - he was the only one that had cleaned the mirrors!The older aged staff (guy with moustache/salt & pepper hair) at the door and also the female with glasses were amazing and extremely friendly. The younger guys at night could care less about their jobs, they were more focused on their friends visiting them and drinking their protein shakes then greeting you and opening the doors.Overall, in my opinion - management has a lot to work on with this hotel. The $25 per day resort fee is like highway robbery because there's not even a pool at this place - it's like a foot deep, that's it. I would have paid more money to stay at a place with better service and house keeping,","Vancouver, Canada","vancityspecial</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",17,2.0

The staff is super friendly and helpful! And the decor was so beautiful, from the lobby to the room. Location is hard to beat!We stayed at the Hyatt Centric towards the end of Jan 2017, so the hotel had been open for about a month. The lobby is on the 8th floor, so you have to take an elevator up. The decor of the lobby is modern, with homey touches. We were greeted by the most friendly front desk concierge, Kaniala. He was extremely friendly and helpful. He ended up upgrading our room, which made the stay unforgettable! He then gave us a tour and walked us up to our room. Now that's what I call customer service! He also checked in with us whenever he saw us in the lobby. His hospitality was above and beyond. . Our room was gorgeous. We had a city view suite with a bath tub, and the view was to die for. The entire wall was made up of a window. The bathroom was so relaxing, with a standalone tub located inside of the shower area. There was a bidet toilet seat, which was a nice touch. The next day we order room service for breakfast, but were mildly disappointed when the meal was served in all to go containers. The food was from the restaurant downstairs, and it was pretty good. The pool area was smaller than expected, but it was still a relaxing place to hang out. The main pool is maybe a 1-1.5 feet deep, while the smaller soaking pool was about 3 feet. For being in the middle of Waikiki, the pool still felt pretty isolated. The only minor problem we ran into was the housekeeping. We were gone for most of the day, but there had not been any turn down service by time we returned at 4 pm. We had called down to request turn down service, and had to call again 25 minutes later until someone came to the room. The person came up to the room appeared very agitated.

The bar is nice and the bar staff do an excellent job. The food is good and the prices are reasonable. There are several things that keep this hotel from getting 5 stars. The biggest problem is the pool, which is only a few inches deep (yes I said inches and not feet). The only ones that use the pool are babies--they love it. The pool is not well protected from the wind. Expect an additional charge of $25 for towels to use around the pool that cannot be used. If you like the windows open at night, they do not open. The people cleaning the room need better training. They should be working from a checklist to insure everything is properly cleaned and in working order. I have had to leave a message on several occasions to have additional cleaning done. Overall I have been enjoying my stay at this hotel, but it needs some improvements.

So if it matters to you to get some of that island breeze, or the sound of the surf, choose somewhere else. Also, what looks like a swimming pool is an ankle-deep ""water feature"" and the whirlpool is not heated -- that's right, stone cold. Brrrrrrr. What a place for Hyatt to cheap out.

We told reception about this and they were very helpful and said we could move rooms, which we did- twice. But both of the rooms had other noise (could hear the lift clearly in one of them, and the aircon rattled in another). We actually ended up back in our original room as that's all they had avail.

This is NOT the case at the Hyatt Centric Waikiki. In addition, the staff was incredibly kind and accommodating. It's only about 1.5 blocks away from the main drag (and beach) in Waikiki, and believe me, if you are able, it's worth the 3 min extra walk to stay here. I wouldn't change a thing about our stay, and plan to book again this coming October. There is no question in my mind this hotel is one of the best on Waikiki, after I've had experiences at other hotels. We ended up having breakfast and The Lanai, and was shocked at how tasty it was. They literally had the best french toast I've ever eaten. If we had been there longer, we would have loved to try it for lunch and/or dinner. It's pretty rare that a hotel eating establishment is very good, but this is beyond that. This is such a rare gem, and to have a nice, new and clean hotel with such a stellar location is great. If you are thinking about staying here, do it, you will NOT regret it. Special thanks to the staff there who made everything about our stay (including the people at The Lanai) so wonderful.

Hyatt Centric Waikiki fit the bill. Clean ivory with splashes of turquoise blue, softened by wood accessories of various shades throughout, the hotel and rooms embrace both urban Honolulu and the natural elements that make Hawaii special. I booked a junior suite for myself and three teens to celebrate an 18th birthday. The hotel is right in the middle of the shopping district of Waikiki, yet not far from the beach. It is easy to walk to everything, including inexpensive and pricier restaurants.The best part was the enthusiasm of the staff. I told them about the birthday and arranged to have mocktails created for Friday evening by the pool. Despite picky orders, the bartender was happy to create custom drinks that looked special and tasted great. The wait staff, housekeepers, and front desk staff were all friendly and professional and made everyone in our party feel special.I used the gym and, though plain with white walls and no decoration, it had adequate equipment. The large windows were a plus, and I appreciated the interactive workout videos (like what one would see in a spin class). Cold filtered water, towels, mats, free weights, and exercise balls rounded out the traditional treadmills and bike. It also had both an elliptical and a stair machine.The food I had was fresh and good. I had a fruit plate and bacon for breakfast (bacon was crisp but not hot, unfortunately), and my coffee cup and water glass were always full. For lunch, I had the baby romaine salad and coconut shrimp pupu. Both were excellent. The menu may seem expensive at first glance but, considering my costs the day before eating outside the hotel, I thought the quality and prices were right on par, if not slightly better. Not to mention, a whole lot less crowded and more relaxing.Top all of that off with a lobby and pool area that we constantly found ourselves lounging in, I'd say this short stay was just what we all were looking for. This will now be my choice for a hotel stay whenever I come to Honolulu.",,sndlwood,10,5.0

Smack dab in the middle of everything and a short walk to the beach. The whole neighborhood looks brand new since the last time I was here - the International Marketplace is totally revamped, Yokocho has some of the best new Japanese casual restaurants (see also: ramen ramen ramen), the Kona coffee shop is the coolest coffee shop I have ever seen, and we no longer have to drive to Nordstrom Rack - there is a brand new one right next to the hotel! Waikiki is back on the map for me now. All this stuff was steps to the hotel.Again, the hotel is brand new - a breath of fresh air as some of the other hotels in the neighborhood are pretty stale. I had a King room, view of the ocean, totally modern bathroom, giant TV (not that I used it), hardwood floors, the works. I didn't get to use the pool or the restaurant but they are airy and bright. Waikiki pools are usually depressing but this one looks sweet - I regret not hanging out there, next time. I did have an awesome drink at the bar (maybe on the sweet side) but didn't have time to finish it. I need to go back to Waikiki and spend more time at the hotel, I guess. The front desk was all ""Aloha Aloha"" but they got me checked in and on my way fast. One lady helped me late at night when I couldn't print out my boarding pass so friendly. (Sorry, I forgot your name!) Bellman went out of his way and helped me contact a taxi where I lost my phone - got it back, thank you - lifesaver. Also printed me out a map to my dinner - bam. I was visibly ecstatic when I asked for a taxi to Nordstrom Rack for my overseas friends but was instead escorted to the new one next to the hotel, kind of blew the Budget on Aloha shirts though. Jamba juice and Starbucks seem to be opening right next to the hotel but, I suggest checking out Kona at International Marketplace. The Starbucks will be good when you just want a latte but you don't want to dress up for anything past the elevator. The hotel even had this freakishly tall guy in the elevator dressed as Elvis (check! Kind of a dork though, sorry dude.) What can I say?

This hotel is charging a resort fee and they are NOT a resort. This is what it pays for:Two (2) Reusable Water Bottles — two low-quality bottles one of which broke almost immediately.Beach Chairs — You have to get them from valet and carry them to the beach (about five blocks away) yourself.Local phone calls from the guest room up to 60 minutes per stay — No one does this anymore.Pool & Beach Towels — This pool is a joke I’ve seen much bigger pools at airport hotels.Business Center Access — two computers in a hallway near the lobby that I never saw anyone use.24-hour Stay-Fit Gym Access — A very basic gym and not worth a fee.Daily Hawaiian Cultural Hour (available five days per week) — nobody mentioned this or knew about it.Complimentary Arrival Beverage — I was offered a plastic cup of pineapple juice while I waited for my room. ""Complimentary means FREE stupid!""Discounted Beach Activities — this was never mentioned at check-in or check-out, so it’s not clear what’s included.What a resort fee is, is just a way to make you think you are paying one price when you compare to other hotels and you actually pay another price when you check out. If you compare apples to apples, this hotel is TOO HIGH! I now look for hotels that charge a fee and mark them off my list whether they are a good location or not. It is dishonest since you cannot opt out, the fee should just be part of the price. A fee is something for something. You do not get a value out of this, because it is charged every day and you only get the FREE drink once. They need to learn from the airlines and start including all charges in the price unless it is optional before someone sues them or the government regulates them.

We actually left a neighboring hotel early just to stay here, and I'm glad we did. For a hotel barely two weeks open, we were surprised how professional and attentive the staff is here. Let's start with the one and only negative: the cold pool! Otherwise, the property is fantastic. Rooms were modern and spacious, with high-end furnishings. Bathroom shower was gigantic, and double sinks round out the large bathroom. Food at the lobby level restaurant was also very good (try the warm cobbler dessert).

Overall, it was a great stay in a fab location although if i could change some things i would to make the stay superb. Everything was new new new. Being a clean freak i prefer things squeaky clean if not new. Our room, in my opinion was a bit on the small side... or perhaps the furniture was a bit too big for the size of the room? The bathroom had a soaking tub plus a separate huge shower stall. I think they could've designed the bathroom to be a bit smaller and save the space for the living area instead. The bathroom lights were quite annoying, especially where the toilet was, which had a separate light. I think it was supposed to turn on if it sensed motion (which it never did) or if the button was pressed. There was a towel hook above the main bathroom light button/sensor which i thought was oddly placed. Our a/c kept coming on and shortly off at night time, so not sure if this is just a function of the sensor being overly active or what (we kept it at 71F). It didn't keep us up but it was noticeable when we were still up watching TV. Overall the room was comfortably, even though a bit on the small side. If you're planning to stay in the hotel room for long periods of time maybe this isn't the hotel for you. On several nights we heard kids screaming at midnight... not sure where the kids were because it didn't sound like it was next to us (on one side it was the exit stairs) - so the walls seems to be pretty thin.Check in is on the 8th floor. The main door to the building is not sensored operated and valet clerks either open the door for you or you have to open it. Sometimes valet clerks are not around, which is not a big deal, but maybe the door should be auto operated for those in wheelchairs or don't have free hands to open the door. Elevators (4) were a bit slow and at peak times you have to wait for several minutes before you can get on. Also noted that service/house keeping uses the same elevator banks which i found odd... most hotels have service elevators for their use i think. This hotel provides 2 reusable plastic water bottles which i found awesome because less waste is better.. but ice and water machines are not available on every floor (only 3 to be exact). I visited 2 during my visit and they were far from the elevator banks. Finally, we visited The Lanai (their restaurant) twice during our visit. Both times were were the only diners there, which is fine... maybe a better quality control over what comes out of the kitchen is needed. To be fair, the food that came out is tasty, but cold/hard or uncooked food (that should be fully cooked) is unacceptable.All the staff we encountered during the visit were very nice. We would visit this property again but maybe ask for a bigger room next time. Location is even better than the Hyatt Regency in my opinion.",new york,"jyp0827</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>new york</strong>",19,4.0

Located at 2255 Kuhio Avenue, the place is so new your GPS may have trouble navigating to it, but this latest Hyatt property is well worth the hunt.We had a 2-queen room with a beautiful ocean view. An in-room refrigerator, Keurig coffee maker and large flat screen TV made us feel at home, and since we actually had to unwrap some of this stuff, I'm fairly certain we were the first family ever to stay there.Everything about the hotel whispers exclusivity. With a walk-in entrance at street level but the actual check-in lobby on the eighth floor, guest rooms are located on floors 9 through 20. The eighth floor is also where you'll find the hotel restaurant, bar, workout room, business center and outdoor deck with open fireplace, spa, pool and a group of cabanas that can be rented for the day. The non-traditional layout reminded us of the Mandarin Oriental in Vegas, giving the property a feeling of privacy and seclusion like we've never previously experienced in the bustle of Waikiki Beach.A super friendly and eager-to-please staff were icing on the cake of this nouveau-chic oasis. We really loved it. The Hyatt Centric is a rare find, and truly over-the-top terrific.",,MrFreeze1960,11,5.0

Although it is new, the hotel and staff have gotten many things right from the start so there is no need to worry about opening glitches. Kuhio Avenue is one of the two main avenues in Waikiki, the other being Kalakaua Avenue. The hotel is within very short walking distances of many shopping, dining and entertainment choices, as well as the Royal Hawaiian Center and the recently renovated International Market Place. The hotel is also on the bus line. Honolulu has one of the best bus systems in the world. The hotel is not directly on the beach but its convenience, comfort, soothing soft décor, and views will serve you well. And regardless of where you travel in the world, the hotel staff can make a huge difference in your stay. The staff members at the Hyatt Centric have what is referred to as the Aloha Spirit with their warm smiles, friendly greetings and offers of assistance. There is a restaurant in the hotel called The Lanai and the food is delicious with generous proportions. Also a pool, exercise room, bar and other amenities. As word spreads about the hotel, it is guaranteed that it will be much sought after place to stay, relax and enjoy a wonderful Hawaiian vacation.","Honolulu, Hawaii","V K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",2,5.0

Couldn't have been better and somewhat surprised for an opening. You would expect a glitch but no way! Staff was friendly, knowledgeable and very accommodating for last minute request/changes. The lobby area is open, modern, with smart furnishings and clean lines. Nice little bar in lobby area. When we arrived at the room (double) we were thrilled that it was so spacious, well designed and comfortable furnishings. Floor to ceiling windows are awesome! The bathroom was oversized for most Waikiki hotels, shower nice size and the water was hot and pressure fantastic! We were late for a function so decided to give the restaurant on property a try. Scary for an opening night usually but not here. Service was fantastic. Food tasty and presentation great. The Ahi Poke outstanding! Noticed also that they had a great kids menu and very reasonably priced. Lastly, location, location, location. In the heart of Waikiki with shopping all around and 1 block from the beach. Pool area was sleek and trendy and fitness area right off lobby too. Loved the echo friendly water idea! They provide you with water bottle that is fillable on several different levels of the hotel with filtered water. Also, the most amazing hair dryers! You will want to take one with you and you can! They are available for sale! Just sorry we stayed only 1 night.

However, after meeting the staff yesterday I felt that I need to write a review because my girlfriend Henny and I had an amazing experience. Mind you, we never used TripAdvisor before and did not know about it until one of the staff mentioned what it was. Because of the excellent interaction with Eddie and after mentioning he is 5 STAR material, I promised him we would do it when we have time. We are staying at the Sheraton Waikiki and we were walking by. Valet greeted us and was nice enough to send us up to go check out the hotel. It looked brand new and it was interesting because the lobby of the hotel is not on the bottom. We went up to the 8th floor and immediately greeted by the front desk Eddie and Alex. I got to personally meet with the manager and what a nice man he is. Eddie immediately stopped what he was doing and offered to give us a tour around.That was the best tour ever. His service is exceptional and I cannot stress that enough. It blew us away that he had so much knowledge and provided great service to us knowing we are not guests. A very young genuine man who took the time to stop what he was doing and showed us around. He offered to show us all the great rooms and also gave me his business card so that when we are interested to stay the next time he can let us know how much it would cost. How amazing and convenient. The rooms are fabulous. Very spacious, great decor, love the open shower! Great place for my girlfriend and I. Alex and Eddie are just amazing and again I want to thank the both of you. I am surprised Eddie is not a manager because WOW! He has excellent service and is definitely good at talking! I was so interested in the rooms after all the information he gave us. With the both of you, the hotel will run successfully and Eddie mentioned you are not fully opened so best of luck to the both of you. You both have amazing things to come to you and Eddie, one day I can see you being an amazing manager. I hope your managers know how valuable you are and take care of you. Thank you Alex and Eddie.

I mean they didn't even have their grand opening yet...which we found out isn't until Jan 15th. So there were minor hiccups, but nothing that they weren't able to resolve quickly. We came in on the Thursday they first opened. They have valet which is $38 per night or you can self-park for $32. Probably best to valet since you have in-n-out privileges. Once you get past valet they direct you to the 8th floor where the front desk is located. We were greeted by a group of their personnel who were all very welcoming. We got leis & fresh pineapple juice from their bar while we were checking in. We just flew over 9 hours so it was a very nice touch. The lobby is decorated in very modern decor. Nice ebb & flow to the space. They have a restaurant & bar on-site on the floor which is situated to the left of registration, the space also opens up to their outdoor pool & cabana area which is a great spot to 'chill.' They even have an outdoor fire pit area...Nice.ROOM: We had a King room which was well decorated, very similar modern style as the lobby. Bathroom was very nice. Shower area is big w/10ft ceilings & good water pressure with a height adjustable shower head. Linens, pillows, amenities were all great. Enough outlets & USB slots to power up your devices. Overall very comfortable room with updated ammenities.SERVICE: Everyone we met were very accommodating & very friendly. At one point, after our 1st day you can tell they were still fixing issues on our floor. One of their maintenance guys just walked into our room, not knowing we were in there but profusely apologized when he realized his mistake. After our 1st night we had to move rooms since they were having issues with their hot water on our floor. We moved up one floor and we were all good. Like I mentioned they were still just working out all the small kinks of opening up this hotel. For our trouble one of the managers (Alex) gave us a complimentary dinner at their restaurant. When we went down later that evening to grab a drink at their bar, Rommel Espina (restaurant supervisor) introduced himself & knowing what happened to us earlier in the day, took care of a couple rounds of drinks for us. What a very nice gesture. It also showed great communication within their hotel staff to know what was going on w/their patrons. He's someone who you have to seek out. Great customer service!AMMENITIES: The hotel offers its guests beach towels, beach chairs & umbrellas which you can get from valet. It was great to know & use with Waikiki Beach so close & the weather a bit unpredictable. We were also able to use these when we went to Kailua Beach. It was another added perk to have during our stay. We didn't have to purchase these items unnecessarily. RESTAURANT: The Lanai. It's not available or showing on Trip Advisor, yet. But it's the restaurant located in the hotel. It's a higher end restaurant with higher end prices. We started off with the ahi tuna avocado poke as an appetizer. It was good, nothing extraordinary but a good start to our meal. I had the seafood pasta. The pasta was a 'squid ink,' which was unique & different, so the pasta itself was dark purple in color...Very good though. The tomato based sauce with scallops, shrimp & mussels made the dish very good. I'd recommend it for those looking for pasta. My wife had the grilled jack fish. Very light & well prepared over a bed of rice with local veggies. She enjoyed it very much. Again, very recommended. To end the night, Rommel the supervisor remembered that we were celebrating our 19th anniversary, so they brought out a very nice dessert of ice cream & fruits with 'Happy 19th Anniversary' written in chocolate. Very nice!!! Thanks for this Rommel!OVERALL: Great stay in a very nice new hotel! A hotel is only as good as the people they employ. From what we experienced, they have a winner here. Erika, Greg & Eddie Yu at the front desk were all great. All were very engaging & offered up some great places to hit up while on our stay. Rommel Espina (supervisor) & Lauren (waitress) in the restaurant were also employees who stood out that made our stay memorable. Again, we didn't get everyone's names but everyone was so friendly & gracious from valet to management. We will definitely be back when we visit Oahu again!
