The bus came regularly and dropped us off right in front of the hotel so it was really convenient. The lobby was beautifully decorated with these hanging dolls for a festival and there was tons of hand sanitizer. We checked into two rooms and they gave the kids these toiletry bags with little slippers and toothbrushes and they were so cute! The kids loved the robes in the room and the view of the metropolitan building. The rooms were big and didn’t feel like other hotels we stayed in Shinjuku. Great location as it was close to the shinjuku station and we had a great time finding the udon restaurants at 8 in the morning. We didn’t eat at the restaurants in the hotel but they looked really nice.

The location is excellent and we had a surprisingly good brunch in one of the hotel restaurants. One issue we had was that on the Saturday evening we were keen to have a drink in the hotel before going out to dinner but every single bar was either full (!!) and not allowing anyone else in or had not yet opened and we were gobsmacked that we couldn't have a drink at any bar in the hotel before we went out to dinner! We eventually had to wait quite some time but managed to get into the smoking area of the bar on one of the top floors and the view was spectacular!! We were extremely lucky because only one person smoked more than one cigarette and we weren't too close. They need to halve the size of the smoking area and open it up to non-smokers because the smoking area was almost empty and the non-smoking area was packed full - not a sensible use of space.,"Auckland, New Zealand","kiwifi2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",25,4.0

It's close to Shinjuku Station, has excellent service, and it's very comfortable - I would definitely come back.SleepingI came for Christmas week with my family of three. We originally booked a deluxe room from an online travel site. Since there were three of us, we requested a 3rd bed, which the hotel provided. The entire week we were there, we slept comfortably without any issue. I'm easily awakened by noises, but I was able to sleep easily at this hotel. There were no late night noises, or disturbances at all. I will say that the beds were quite firm - so if you're used to a medium or softer bed, please take that into account. WiFiThe Wifi in the room worked well. We watched HD movies on my iPad, and also played online games with a laptop. The speed is about average, but it was enough for my needs.FeaturesWe had a""Superior"" room with 3 beds: 2 Double beds and 1 Roll-away bed. (Note, for the roll-away bed, we had requested it during reservation.) It wasn't huge, but large enough for us to feel at home, and definitely larger than other hotel rooms I've seen in Japan. It came with typical room ammeneties: refrigerator, closet, robes, towels, slippers, toothbrushes, and other toiletries. There were three electrical outlets that had U.S.-style sockets, and USB charging ports. There's a safe that's easily operated, but unfortunately it could not fit my 15inch Laptop. On the main dresser, there was a smartphone that could be taken while exploring the city, but we never took it out of its charging dock. (I didn't want to carry another device while on foot.) Near the bathroom was the airconidtioning/heating panel. This was easily operated and we kept it on the warm side since it was quite cold in Tokyo at the time.BathroomLike many hotels in Japan, the room comes with a bidet-style toilet which I love. The best part: the seat was always warm - no more cold seats! There were enough towels and toiletries for all three of us to spare. I really liked the shower's water pressure - it was powerful, and not weak at all.Local AreaThe Keio Plaza is within 5-minutes walking distance to the busiest train station the world - Shinjuku Station. This is a huge plus because the station not only allows for easy-access to mass transit, but it contains a vast amount of shops and restaurants. What's more, there's many convenience stores on the streets nearby to buy everyday items, cheap meals, and access to ATMs. (There's a convenience store in the hotel as well.) Also, the surrounding area around the station has even more shops and restaurants to explore (especially on the east side). Being so close to all these services, stores, and restaurants really helps when you walk all day long. ServiceThe staff we talked to were polite, respectful, very attentive. My Japanese language skills are limited at best, so it was great that everyone we spoke to knew English well. There's always several people in the main lobby who will help direct you to the appropriate desk (check-in, check-out, concierge services, shuttle to airports, taxi, money exchange, etc.)Traveling between the airports to the Keio Plaza Hotel:If you're traveling from Narita or Haneda Airport, there's multiple ways to get the Keio Plaza Hotel and back. We took the popular Airport Limousine Bus from Narita. Alternatively, if you are traveling during a busy season, you may want to avoid the traffic on the roads and take a train. (We arrived on Christmas Eve, and car traffic going into Tokyo from Narita turned a 45 minute trip into a 2 hour ordeal for us.) Besides the bus services, there are multiple trains that you can take to the hotel. You just have to be resigned to pushing your luggage around and walking from Shinjuku station to the hotel itself. When I come back to Shinjuku in the near future, I will definitely have this hotel in mind. It has excellent service, location, and ameneties.","San Francisco, California","zeracast</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",41,5.0

On arrival as I only purchased the one way limousine bus to Keio, I was checked in by a very helpful young guy who quickly assigned the room and welcomed us and advised to speak to the concierge about a return to Narita as they know more information.A girl took our cases to the room and was very polite, room was nice - bathroom a little dated but good size room and had all the basics you need. For the price you would expect a little more I think but I’m used to travelling and this is a city so typical business hotel to give you an idea.We then ventured out and on the way out I spoke to the concierge as the front desk suggested but found him to be very unhelpful to us. He just pointed at a slip with the Narita bus times on and said no earlier ways to Narita. I was then thinking I would have to pay £100 for a taxi but decided to do my own research and you can visit a website called Keisei Highway Bus that goes every hour to Narita from Tokyo Station. Why the concierge do not have this information is bizarre as it should be there job to be helpful but he was disinterested and just posted to the limousine bus slip. So if you are leaving super early to Narita or you have a very early flight then this could be a helpful option for you.Breakfast was good, just what you need a selection of western and Japanese (omelette station and bacon, sausage, cereals etc) and you get daily coupons.ATM is in the convenience shop on the same floor as breakfast restaurant so easy to get cash at the hotel. Hotel have umbrellas as well for rainy days so speak to the bell boy/station.Definitely download the Tokyo subway map it’s a godsend. Also we purchased a 48 hour metro pass which is great and this you can buy from shinjuku station (you can buy at Narita separately but it’s cash only) .... at shinjuku station, it’s easy to purchase and is activated only when you first use it. If you buy a metro pass, it can only be used for metro lines and not JR lines. Essentially they are both at the same place but when you are going through with your ticket just remember not the JR pass this will save you lots of hassle.Location is excellent ... 5 minutes to Shinjuku station main area.The staff at the hotel were lovely, from breakfast staff at Jurin to reception. Like previous comments the concierge needs to be more helpful and approachable and also know better information like the other bus and not just give you a slip and say nothing. This caused us a little worry and was unnecessary.FYI we booked the Mount Fuji tour via sunrise tours based at the hotel (worked out at £100 each) was very good and guide was lovely.We also ended up taking the NEX express train from Shinjuku to Narita, the first one is at 05.55AM but takes one hour and there is no traffic obviously so again I done my own research on this and hope you find the info helpful.Thanks Keio team ",Midlands,"mitchandsheyla</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Midlands</strong>",57,4.0

In stead of accommodating through my one night booking, the manager insisted on having me pay up 10,000JPY for early check in. I paid 1,5 days for 8 hours use, and the hotel was able to re-rent out my paid room for one more night... I like the location and cleanliness of the Keio Plaza, but the lack of accommodating was unfortunately representative of Japanese bureaucracy and inflexibility. Giving guests a feeling of being welcomed and treated fairly should stand above whether the booking IT System can or cannot process irregular cases such as my early check-in / check-out. 残念です。","Singapore River, Singapore","MatthiasV313</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore River, Singapore</strong>",6,1.0

The room price was much higher. But still we are grateful that they accommodated our request to extend our stay. Keio Plaza has many positive points. Perfect location to explore Tokyo as it is next to Shinjuku station. The hotel service is good. It is very convenient if you're coming from either Narita or Haneda as there is an airport shuttle that can bring you to and from the airport.

I also checked that the room could sleep 3. I was also booked on the plaza luxe floor with access to the lounge. On check in, I was told the extra charge for my third guest and to show his passport when he arrived a day later. The reception did not know of my access to the lounge and I had to show my emails. It was unexpected because all this should be in the system. I got my room and it was NOT the upgraded room I paid for. I had to call down and asked. I waited for a reply and after some time I was shown to the correct room per the photos per my booking per the extra charges I paid. Things did not improve. When my third guest came, I dutifully went to reception showed the passport and wanted to pay the extra per day for the 3rd guest. The reception said no. It was not permitted. This was exasperating because I arranged a larger room at more costs to cater for 3. After some to and fro I gave up and booked another room. At an exorbitant costs. I then had the horrific experience of the duty manager whom I requested to assist with reservations for dinner. He was unpleasant and not at all helpful. This was a complete contrast to the fantastic service I had with Hyatt. The duty manager and concierge were extremely polite and helpful. Not so here. I also had an issue with the q at breakfast. It was a long wait and when we got in at 9:35 am after waiting for 25 min, we were told that we had to leave by 10:15 am. The point being that if you cater to these huge numbers, perhaps arrangements can be made for the q to stop at a certain time. Or maybe arrange alternative seating areas. The WiFi was also problematic. You had to key in a long password each day. All in all I must say it was not a pleasant stay.

We opted for the Keio Plaza as it was close to the train station and seemed to be on the more ""quiet"" side of Shinjuku, yet still within walking distance of the hustle and bustle. The hardest part when arriving at Shinjuku station via the Narita Express was finding the West Exit during the evening rush hour, but after locating it, it was a breeze. It is also right between shinjuku station and another local subway line has an entrance on the other side so it was convenient to be close to these for sight seeing. The hotel is huge, with a few different exit/entry points, so sometimes it was easy to get lost as far as which exit you went out of and which direction you need to go to get where you were going but otherwise we loved everything about this hotel as our first pit stop in Japan. There are a lot of different room options which was overwhelming. When booking through a third party site, I recommend going to the hotel site as well and comparing descriptions there to see what differences there are between room types. We ultimately decided on the Superior Twin Renovated Room in the Main Tower. Check the square footage and room floor plan on the hotel site to make sure you're getting what you want. There were also renovated rooms in another tower, but those didn't have the larger bathroom that we wanted. This was the largest room we had in our time in Japan and most set up like a western style room. The bathroom was large as well with great toiletries and a great tub that I took advantage of after long days of walking around. We had a gorgeous view out of our window of the government building as well. Only real complaint was the beds were pretty hard. I actually prefer a firm bed, but this was really firm. This seems to be common in Japan though.Overall, great stay and would definitely chose this hotel again.","Seattle, Washington","jesslynnec</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",43,5.0

It was recommended because of the size of the rooms, price and good location. We also had read that we should choose a room in the South Tower for the view, but we quickly found that wasn't necessarily good advice, since the Tokyo Government Building blocks most of the view from this side of the building, and the rooms have not been renovated in this tower.We arrived at the hotel around 11 am and after a long wait in line at the front desk, we were told we couldn't check in. (We had requested early check in made our reservation.) We pressed it--saying we just wanted to check in, drop off our luggage, and leave to tour some of Tokyo (planning to come back later in the day to go to our room) and finally, they allowed us to ""sort of"" check in and store our luggage, but that took a few more steps to do. When we finally got in our room we found it nicely decorated, but not as large as the pictures indicated, and definitely not as nice as what we paid for, or as nice as what we'd experienced in other parts of Japan that we had just been to. Yes, it was on a high floor with a sliver of a view, and it had nice amenities (although not the l'Occitane toiletries as promised) AND it was the only hotel we stayed at in Japan where we actually got ONE bed rather than two--but I must admit I was disappointed.The bed was very uncomfortable and hard, and the internet was a little difficult to access. We ended up getting help with that, but it wasn't self-explanatory. The bathroom was small, but had a nice shower with good water pressure. The lobby and main areas were very nice and there were plenty of elevators available for our use.The hotel is in a quieter area of Shinjuku which is nice, but it's a bit of a hike to/from the main train station (about 15 minutes), particularly at the end of a day of walking. They offer a bus service to the two Tokyo airports for a fee. (We paid $32) They also have tour services onsite, which we didn't use, but it was a nice feature.If I were to stay here again, I'd be sure to get a renovated room, and I might even splurge and get a club-level room, just to have a little more bang for the buck.","Livermore, California","Terri M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Livermore, California</strong>",52,3.0

We stayed in the Premier Grand Rooms which are amongst the largest. It’s not cheap but money well spent. The only downside is it’s did not come in connecting rooms but the kids were put right next door and in fact they said that they were happier it wasn’t connecting!One of the key reasons we stayed at Keio was the free bus to Disney. It was a time saver. This was key to get to Disney in good time and comfortably instead of the busy trains and still be in the heart of the city to get the bright lights Tokyo vibes. Just remember that you have to book the hotel’s bus seats about a month or more before you arrive to guarantee seats on the bus but as we went to Disney Sea during the week there was lots of room. The rooms were big. The feedback of many other hotels we researched were how small the rooms were. However, the Premier Grand rooms at Keio were big for any country. I liked the fact that the toilet, wash basins and bathroom (with both shower and bathtub) were separate sections of the room so time is not wasted waiting for the other person. These bathroom areas were also big and well laid out. And all the gadgets! You knew you were in Japan with the technology. Bluetooth bose system, lots of chargers, plug adapters and a portable WiFi device that we heard you can take anywhere with you to have free WiFi but we had our own so never tried it. Even the toilets were full of gadgets like opening for itself when you come in. The WIFi did have a two step login process that did not work well with iPhones so we had to call their IT help desk a few times. And it showed that they were prompt to arrive. A drawer full of toiletries that in other hotels you had to ask for like combs AND hair brushes, shavers, toothbrush set and boxes of stuff I didn’t open. Breakfast was great and the chef whipped up all kinds of omelettes - even the Benedict style which was a hit. The Premier Grand room had its own check in area, lounge and breakfast area so we never experienced the crowds on the mornings. There were some busy days where you had to wait a 5 - 10 minutes to be seated but things flowed and there were great views. We did try the other more general eating area when we had to get up earlier for the Disney bus and it wasn’t crowded that day and food was great, varied and well presented. The hotel had lots of additional services that made things very convenient. The Japanese seem bent on keeping you comfortable and keeping you happy. If you don’t look pleased about something they try to remedy it right away. The Concierge did all the research you needed and calls which you need if you don’t speak the language, there was a well known on-site tour company, a luggage service company to transfer your luggage to the next hotel etc. etc. Unlike other hotels in Japan, the English of the staff at Keio was very good and was a relief that they understood me. Try calling hotels in Japan on to get info and you’ll soon see what I mean. We tried the tea ceremony experience offered by the hotel. That was an excellent cultural experience and the host was wonderful and authentic. One tip is to sign up as member of Keio Plaza. I am not sure on the criteria but I got some discounts on the room rate. The hotel was right opposite the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building Observatory which offers a free viewing deck and had great views. The hotel is about 10mins walk to the Shinjuku train station which is main train hub in Tokyo so you are well connected. Sometimes this walk was a hassle so we took taxis if we were not in the mood to walk. Just bear in mind that most taxis in Tokyo take only 4 persons so if you are more than 4 then pre-book a large taxi or you have to take 2 taxis. I decided to cut short my stay by a day as we did everything we wanted to do in Tokyo so wanted an extra day in Kyoto. I gave the hotel a few days notice and they didn’t make it a problem and organized the refund without fuss. I really can’t praise enough this hotel and their wonderful staff. The Premier Grand room experience, Disney bus, excellent level off English and so many convenient services in one place made it a hotel I would highly recommend.

The rooms were great, the view could have been better, despite me specifically asking for the best view possible (oh well). Everything except the following was on par with a great 4 to average 5* hotel:1) we chose the hotel because of great on-site dining. We stayed for 5 nights and were unable to dine in their “better” establishments, such as sushi or teppanyaki. Alegedly they were solidly booked but whenever we passed through, most seats were empty.2) housekeeping was not great. They left some dirt on the back of the shelves throughout the 5 days we stayed. The quality of bed linen varied. And during the only day we needed to stay in for the afternoon, they left all our three rooms until late and made us leave and go out.3) the pool had a weird regulation, not allowing people with earrings on. Both my daughters and me have earrings fixed so that they’re impossible to take out. When I explained this, they countered by saying that it would be unfair to other guests who had removed their jewellery to let us in. After some discussion, they brought us plasters to stick on our ears to cover the earrings. The plasters eventually fell off in the water, but since we had them in the first place, everything was all right. Weird.4) several times I came accross a very strong request to bring in all the key cards. If we’d not complied, there were fines to be levied. Again, weird.Overall, it is a hotel I would recommend. However, for myself, I would try to look at other options in the 4-5* better priced range.To end on the good note, we were really pleased with the services in the Premier Lounge. Breakfasts were great, even if sometimes quite crowded.

We had learnt our lesson on children and bed arrangements in Japanese hotels and we copped to it. No way we were giving our money to the other hotel! Now, I have read some oft he other reviews here and I do agree with much of what is said about the hotel. Our experience was extremely courteous staff during a busy evening period and a willingness to explain all about the rooms and fees including showing us diagrams of rooms and bed sizes. We were welcomed to book using a web app, nad staff came to find us the moment the booking came through. In that time, thaey had arranged the third bed for our room (three king singles), placed our bags on the trolly, delivered them to the room, and we were in! Given the previous couple of hours, it was a relief. If you had seen the wife's distress at the other hotel, you would know how I felt.This really is a typical mid-high level hotel. It was expensive, but then again, these hotels are expensive in Japan but is is backled up with good service, amenities complimentary items and even an English language copy of the Japan Times at the door in the morning. All the expected facilities are there, including numerous resturaunts, cafe, bakery and a great little convenience store on the lower level. The hotel is accross from the municpal bulding with it's free observation deck and you can walk to and from Shinjuku station completely undercover. We also chose to book a Mt Fuji tour from the hotels tour office, whic depated from the hotel but dropped us at Shinjuku at the end. Great for finding dinner! We didn't eat in the hotel as that was not the experience we wanted and we felt the prices were a bit inflated. Checkout was smooth and quick. I really did like the staff here. Room was a little cramped with the extra bed, but that was our problem, not the hotels. Great bathroom, with a huge tub, lots of hot water, amenites and even hte mirror was heated over the basin so you could shave in the fog. Tea and coffee facilities were ther but no milk or sugar. I think this is just a culture difference and not a cost exersize. This part of Shinjuku goes pretty quiet after dark so no worries with road noises etc. Overall, a nice stay but expensive.

But the way we were treated and the smell of our room, we thought we had too.When we arrived the lady at the desk was lovely, the lobby itself was very impressive too. The lady even gave us a free box of chocolates as it was our honeymoon. We went up to our room looking forward to a bit of time to relax before heading out. As we entered the room we were greeted with a very very strong smell of smoke. It was as if someone had spent the last couple of days smoking in it. We went back out of the room to check that it was definitely a non smoking room, which it was, as there was a no smoking sign on the door. My husband went back down to the lobby to mention this to them and see if we could switch rooms. He was told to come back after 17:00 and they would sort it. They sent a man up to the room with a machine, we weren’t quite sure what it did, but it honestly made it smell worse. Feeling optimistic that it would be sorted during the afternoon, we went out for a bit. When we got back we headed up to the room to see if it still smelt of smoke, it smelt just as bad. So my husband went back down to the lobby. On returning he mentioned that it was a waist of time, that he shouldn’t have bothered as the only response to his questions was no and that apparently we booked a smoking room. Bearing in mind the room we were given when checking in was a non smoking room made me question what was being said about this. The staff had refused to change our room and refused to compensate us. So we felt a little annoyed and thought we would wait until the morning and see how the smell went. However, this was not the case and it got worse. During our time at the hotel we weren’t able to sleep through the night and would wake up coughing because of the smoke. The smell of smoke got everywhere and wasn’t very nice at all.

We stayed in the South Tower in a standard room, which was simple but a comfortable and clean place to rest. Right when we first got to the hotel, I noticed my phone was missing, and Inoue at the front desk was able to call the company for the shuttle we had taken from the airport to help find it. My phone was back in my possession that evening and I was very grateful for Inoue's help since it would have been difficult to navigate the language barrier myself.We received breakfast coupons for each day of our stay, and found each of the 3 restaurant options for breakfast to be very enjoyable. It was a great value to have breakfast included, and the food was very good. I also used the Disney shuttle service to go to and from the park, which was quite comfortable and convenient.Overall, it was a very nice stay at this hotel, and we found it to be pleasantly quiet at night.

Bed linens were dirty / stained. There was a piece of tissue paper on the carpet by the entrance of our room since day one (the housekeeping maid never both to vacuum?). Black stains found by the bath tub, faucet, sink, even toilet bowl (again housekeeping maid never both to brush the toilet bowl throughout out stay. The carpet on the 2nd floor where the restaurants are is getting dirty / stains. Worst one is the service / manners provided by the front desk. We asked if we can have a late check out (check out at noon instead of 11am), they offer no apology / 'sorry for the inconvenience', but bluntly stated there will be an additional 4xxx yen for the additional hour. There's no recourse, no explanation, nothing, just the additional fee if we wanted to stay 1 extra hour. Of course we decided not to despite the amount of business we brought to KEIO throughout the years starting with my father 40 years ago!

The location of Keio hotel is just near to Shinjuku Station. I landed in the evening in Tokyo Narita Airport and took a very simple and easy train Narita Express from Narita airport to Shinjuku Station. In Shinjuku take the west exit and follow the Gouverment Building sign. The easiest way to find Keio Hotel is to look for pillar with “D” letter. When you find D60 in the left is Keio Plaza Hotel.The check in was completely Japanese (very gracious and very fast) and I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the room as I had heard all rooms in Tokyo were very small.The staff are friendly and helpful in every way. The room was bright, well decorated and had some fantastic details, not only the usual toiletries with a large assortment of toiletries (hotel supply an elastic hair band HOW COOL IS THAT) but shoe shining cloths, power adaptors, supply of mineral water every day and a wonderful Japanese toilet with heated seat. I would love one of those at home! Beds and pillows were very comfortable.Very rich breakfast in 2 different styles Japanese and Western style. I tried every day some Japanese cuisines and it is very good. Udon and soup of day are two best thing I have at breakfast. Also the algae are something unusual to eat.One of the amenities in the room is the free use of a smart phone with internet. Phone is located in the room on the desk. There is free Internet on it and Google Map was very helpful in big city of Tokyo. Phone will ask for a departure date and later tell you that it will erase all personal data after date you check out. Everything was in English. Free use of a smart phone is definitely a plus.I would like to thank to all of the staff from Keio for making as an enjoyable stay, and a special thanks to Ayaka Hagi and Shingo Kobori for helping me.Keio Plaza Hotel makes a great landing pad for our first Tokyo visit.

We weren't sure what to expect, given the property's age, but we were very impressed throughout our stay. The service was excellent, the room much larger than we expected, a fantastic view from our room, and VIP treatment at the Luxe Lounge every day during our stay. We opted for a Plaza Luxe room with Luxe Lounge access, which gave us a high (33) floor room in the South Tower. We were very impressed and surprised by the size and spaciousness of the room, along with the breathtaking view. In the foreground was the impressive Tocho complex, with Mt. Fuji standing watch in the background. It was really pretty cool. The complimentary snacks, drinks, etc. served in the lounge were great, and the service was excellent. They obviously make an effort to treat the guests like VIPs. We obviously paid a bit more than a standard room, but it was definitely worth the minimal extra cost. Service throughout the hotel was truly exceptional. Another pleasant surprise was the location. We expected it to be further from Shinjuku station, but it turned out to be a short, straight, 5-minute walk at most. And right through the bustling Shinjuku west-gate area filled with stores, restaurants, and bars. In terms of transportation access, the location really can't be beat. Extremely convenient, in fact. Plenty to do, see, eat, and drink just steps from the hotel.The wife and I both agreed that Keio Plaza will be our new home-base from now on for all future trips to Tokyo.","Atlanta, Georgia","Tad L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",23,4.0

Like all other hotels that we stayed in, there were no little milks for Western tea-crema was available but how vile is that? However I did get used to drinking roasted tea as it came-still trying to like green tea!!Breakfast:- There was an extensive choice of either Japanese or Western food, and you could eat in any of 3 restaurants (2 western/Japanese and 1 Japanese). My only complaint which seemed to apply to every hotel that we stayed in on the tour was that the western hot choices (sausage and bacon) were luke warm and we English do like our food hot!!! The hotel has its own bakery and so not surprisingly pastries and bed were extremely good.We thought the location was great-only a short distance from the train station and from restaurants and shops in the City-also very safe to walk about.There were some lovely shops within the hotel and a very handy supermarket on ground level which stops open long hours-perfect for getting food if you've had a long day and need something to munch on or to get a drink.All in all, a really pleasant experience and I would recommend this hotel without hesitation.I cant say if this is a mid range or luxury hotel as the costs were paid for by the tour company.","Barnsley, United Kingdom","KaraokeSue7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barnsley, United Kingdom</strong>",123,5.0

First, this is the second time I stay at this hotel, 11 years apart. Second, I reserved a Premier Grand room. Shinjuku is the place to stay in Tokyo as it is the center of all activities: subway, restaurants, shops, entertainment, etc. The rooms are big considering it is Tokyo and they are amazing in terms of the use of space. Make sure to open all the drawers in the room as they contain pyjamas, robes, amenities, iron, safe, slippers, etc. The toilet (closet) door as I would call it opens automatically and the toilet/bidet gets ready for use which is great but somehow annoying to anyone else sleeping in the room. The service is impeccable from the time you arrive till you leave. The breakfast at the Club Level is superb and the service very attentive. As for the restaurants, we did not use them as I remember a Kobe beef dinner 11 years before that cost me 250$ per person: still the same price today. You can step just out of the hotel to a horde of restaurants at very reasonable prices.A piece of advice: become a club member (free) """"""""before"""""""""" you reserve.

Some people would like to stay closer to JR station, some people would like to stay closer to Kabukicho. My personal choice is making balance between good location and spacious room. So I try Keio Plaza Hote this time. I have to walk about 8-10mins from JR station to the hotel. You can choose to take airport limousine directly to hotel from Haneda or Narita Airport. I booked a larger newly refurbished room as size is 35sqm (it’s quite spacious room in most Tokyo hotels). The room is located at 29/F but the view is not that good as there are quite a lot high rise buildings around (you can see the room view picture I uploaded). The lobby is large and grand but not a modern stylish type. The check in process is smooth. The reception man provided basic smile and information that I needed to know eg the breakfast restaurants, Wi-Fi, checkout time etc. Once entered to the room, the decoration is the same as shown on trip advisor. It’s clean and tidy as most of Tokyo hotels. The room provided bottled water and instant green tea and coffee packs. There is a multi charger for use. The bathroom is good and quite spacious so that you can take a good bath then enjoy self made onsen to relieve your tired body after shopping or walking for a whole day. The toilettes are from L'OCCITANE. The brand is good with refreshing lemon smell but it will not give you bubbly feel after apply on the body (I personally do not prefer this type of shower gel). There is a tiny cube of bath salt provided for bath. Bed and pillow are ok to me and I don’t have any compliant about it. After sleep, the most important is breakfast. My wife is very picky about the hotel’s breakfast. There are 3 restaurants you can choose. One is American style, one is Japanese style and the last one is mixed buffet style. Surely, we choose the western-Japanese buffet breakfast. You may need to queue outside the restaurants for a short while as it’s quite busy. The variety of food is ok, there are 2-3 cold cuts, 2-3 simple cheese, 6-8 types of danish or bread, Japanese rice, udon, miso soap, Japanese fish, omelet, fruits, salad. It’s ok but not surprising. The quality of food is up to standard, not bad but not the best. I need a cup of good coffee but the coffee provide is too acidic and I like coffee which is strong and nutty. May be most of the coffee in Japan is relatively weak and easy. There is swimming pool and gym room in the hotel. But I am busy in shopping and sightseeing, so I really don’t have time to try the gym room for 3 nights stay. Tokyo is big! Shinjuku is the main place to go shopping and eating. If you don’t like shopping, you can choose to stay in other places. I do recommend Keio plaza hotel Shinjuku but please book a larger newly refurbished room.

The size of the bed would be completely forgivable - Japanese people tend to be under 6 foot tall, so that is understandable...however, the comfort of the bed WAS NOT.

My choice was well made!I travelled with my mother, we arrived from Haneda airport by using the limousine bus, that was a cheap and right option, they were organised and very precise, once we arrived we had the bellmen ready to welcome us and once we entered for checking in while waiting there was a member of the staff that gave us the map while the bellmen were taking our luggage with them giving us a number.Checking in was fast, we received all the basic information and we finally got our room in the main tower on the 24th floor, view was awesome and we also received a welcome writing on my bed with 2 little presents.Room was good, not small like i expected, bathroom was small yes, but i understand the japanese standards are different from italians so i was ok with that, there were so many accessories inside that i couldn't need for more :)First day we used the room service, food was great, of course prices were high and over average but considering it's a room service and a 4 stars maybe i can understand..however think twice before ordering..outside there are many nice and less painful restaurants :)Hotel infact was located very close to shinjuku, near also to the metro station and all the main attractions i wanted. I loved the breakfast at the glass court and was not the only one having breakfast, however it was the most crowded as it was in my opinion the best:) We also tried the japanese one and another one but the first in my favourite list is the glass court, doesn't matter how much i have to queue. Staff in there was very nice and attentive to our needs so i have nothing to say about that:)People that complain about the lobby crowded they should really stay at home, because they have no experience of travelling..this is a very busy hotel as there are many rooms and many people check in and check out at all times, so it's pretty normal, if you choose a hotel is for sleeping not for staying in the lobby to care about people passing or disturbing your sight..come on.. All the staff was lovely starting from the bellmen that make exceptional efforts to take care of our luggage even when raining.The ony complain was sunrise tours that wrote in our website they offerend 22% discount on shinkansen tickets and when i went to their office in the hotel they told me to go to shinjuku station, so what is the point of making a discount if after you send me to the station to get the ticket at the original price? They don't understand english very good and they write wrong in their website considering they don't supply tickets.Overall i am very happy about this hotel and i would surely come back!!!!!!!!!!","Rome, Italy","davidepuglisi1980</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rome, Italy</strong>",305,5.0

We travelled to Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ueno, Nippori quite a few times and it did not cost us anything since we had the JR pass.The hotel is near 7/11, Family Mart and a lot of shops and restaurants. The Japanese family mart closest to the hotel on the same side (going towards the station) is by far the cheapest, but they are all cheap for food and drinks.Reception speaks English and are helpful. The Tokyo guide is really good (located near the elevator).Shampoos, conditioner, body wash are all lovely. They provide toothbrushes and razors.Towels are in the cupboard but are on the smaller side.Reception ''loan'' travel adapters for a 1000Yen deposit, which you get back when you return it.ALL hotels in Japan have a 3pm checkin but they all store luggage for free.CONS: From the street to reception there is a flight of stairs and no elevator. But there is an elevator to the rooms. But the man on reception as we checked out helped us carry our luggage down the stairs.Bathroom is small and you will need to adjust the shower head so it points down on an angle otherwise it will shoot straight ahead. There is a step up to go inside bathroom.Rooms do not have 3 beds, so a triple room is a double bed and a king single. The walls and windows are thin.

We liked the location, as we were a close walk to Shinjuku and Shinjuku station, and a 35 minute walk to Harajuku. We also liked that we could control the temperature in the room and that we were given a bottle of water daily. Generally speaking, it’s nice that you can safely drink water from the tap in Japan. We liked the breakfast options, both Kagara and Glass Door. There was a good variety of food options. We did not like that we could not check in before 2pm (not ideal after flying a red eye from California and landing at 4:30am) and they were very strict and rigid about this. We also did not like the wait for breakfast daily. It seems like no matter what time we arrived, there was a 15 or more minute wait for the Japanese and American buffet at Glass Door. It was also not our preference that the hotel was loaded with tourists and the lobby was seemingly always packed with foreigners. This is not the hotel’s fault, but it is a large hotel. If we had to book again, we may prefer a smaller, quieter hotel or Airbnb. ","Los Angeles, California","NeedsAVacation26</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",187,4.0

There were 3 beds and plenty of walking space. We had every amenity you could think of and the room was worth every penny. I loved the bathroom too, just beautiful. We ended our trip back at Keio Plaza and booked a room in the South Tower. Yikes what a difference! That’s the only reason why the hotel didn’t get a 5 star rating.

I have yet to read an accurate review of this hotel. For starters this is a very large property which translates to lines everywhere. There is a line to check in, a line to check out, a line to get on any elevator(and yes the elevators are exceedingly slow). There is a line to have breakfast at the standard buffet restaurant. This is not a short 4-5 person line, we are talking lines that wind around and double back and last twenty to thirty min before entering the restaurant. Yes, it cherry blossom season but deal with it. Hire more staff there are tables, they are just all dirty and not cleared for folks to sit down. There is a line to the hotel bathrooms in the lobby and restaurants. There is a line to drop off luggage with bellman. There is a line to retrieve said luggage when needed. U get the idea. Once you overcome the lines, you will be greeted by a front desk which does not speak English well. The attendants are robotic and any requests will be handled in halting, uncomfortable broken English with inaccurate and useless information so don't waste your time. Just look up your question on the internet.The rooms: as we booked last minute we knew we would have to switch rooms mid stay. We booked two rooms per night and stayed in a Deluxe room first, and later the Superior renovated room. Their standard rooms are Unrenovated and we didn't stay in one. The Deluxe room is fully renovated, meaning the bathroom has been done. The Superior 'renovated' room (south tower)has an old bathroom with a cheap single layer bathroom shower curtain and peeling, tarnished gold bathroom fixtures, old caulk and old tile. Bathroom amenities in the superior renovated rooms are likewise cheap, with no name soap and small bottles of cheap watered down shampoo. In the deluxe category you get L'occitane products.The beds: in both room categories the beds are hard, with a thin mattress cheap mattress overlay and uncomfortable scratchy sheets to wrap it all up. There is no boxspring and its surprisingly cheap feeling. Despite exhaustion from an all day flight I woke up in the middle of the night because the bed was just too rough. Booking: we booked directly with the hotel (native speaker) and it still took me hours to get a confirmation despite calling back several times to request the email confirmation. The reservation dept have inconsistent, incomplete inventory information when called directly. Their room availability differs on line with the LHW website (side note: hotel caliber does not belong with this group), and that deviates from inventory on Booking.com so check everything if you bother to stay here.Service: pretty fake and did not have one actually useful interaction. We extended our stay by a night. We did this by using booking.com because calling the front desk directly led us to believe they were sold out which was just plain wrong. With our booking, com reservation we went downstairs the day we were scheduled to check out to inform them we would be staying longer. The front desk told us we could not remain in the same room although it was the same category we extended in. We were told they still had not gotten our booking.com reservation though it was hours later as well which also makes no sense but whatever. We were told with unwavering certainty that our present rooms were already allocated to another party coming that day, and so we had to 1) check out and return our keys 2) pack all our luggage 3) bring our own luggage down to the storage desk 4) check in again to obtain new keys 5) grab our bags again from the porter in the afternoon. So we do all of that (which was pretty annoying,) only to find out later that we... wait for it, were going back to the SAME room. So we go back to the same room only to find out that it was NOT even serviced that day. Its a mess, with unemptied trash and food leftover (albeit from us), towels strewn about. So now, at 8pm at night we are waiting for Housekeeping to clean the room for the first time. Another annoyance would be the knowledge that though we also asked for Adjacent rooms all over our reservation we were confidently told there were None. While standing in the hallway and waiting for Housekeeping we watch two new sets of guests roll into the two Directly adjacent rooms with their luggage, which we had asked to occupy since we were traveling with underage kids. So basically everything we were told was a total unapologetic LIE and inaccurate. Everything we had to do that day (check in, check out, pack our bag etc) was unwarranted and wasted a great deal of our time. I called their General Manager (Mr. Sakamoto) who eventually came up with his side kick. (native speaker here)- I understood what he said in Japanese which was basically that this was a pretty messed up situation. I asked to be moved. (no dice, hotel was full, sure,,, ok). It took them another half hour to clean the room. Mr. Sakamoto never comes back. I am given a box of $5 cookies as some sort of gesture from the side kick, which is a joke and just punctuated their lack of understanding even further. In the interest of moving on with our night we let it go. But, we clearly should have been compensated for the evening. We booked two rooms a piece for 4 nights, and the whole place was pretty much a disaster bursting at the seams with too many tourists and too little time to actually provide decent service, and a great deal lost in translation. I would not recommend this hotel, at the Deluxe category, club concierge, or any level as there are too many flaws from the moment you walk through the door. The GM should be re-trained in hospitality. At any other property in the world, our experience would merit more than just a perfunctory deep bow and token box of cheap crackers.",NYC,"Karis L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",114,1.0

Hotel is rather large and we stayed up on the 29th floor (premium floor) which means again busy periods you can be waiting a while for elevators. If you stay close enough to the lifts this also can get noisy within certain times! Staff were not particularity helpful although to be fair language barrier/culture didn't help! Even though on honeymoon there were no specific efforts to acknowledge this which was a shame.Check in- fine, receptionist a little rude and direct but I am sure meant well. Paid no attention at all to the fact we were on honeymoon and did not go through details at all which meant we were unsure of a lot of things and timings throughout our stay e.g. breakfast, late hours dinning and the fact we had lounge access meaning free snacks and drinks late afternoon! Wish we had worked that one out sooner! She did however accommodate an hour earlier check in time for us which we were grateful for.Food- due to the season and number of guests breakfast in the morning often meant a long que- waiting time can be up to 15 mins in some mornings. Get there early. Food was average and meal times where often crowded with lots of food running out quickly. Bread always went early and with a bakery within the hotel selling fresh bread you would have thought getting more was easily accessible. I am dairy free which was often a challenge within the restaurants in hotel.Location- With high season means high prices of course. Hotel was in a good location within Shinjuku shopping districts and business area. Not far from Shinjuku Gyeon Park which means you can get there early and avoid major ques!In summary, a comfortable hotel for a short stay, rooms clean but dated and old and by no means luxurious.

Soundproofing still remains a major problem - I'm a light sleeper and you often hear noise from the room above which is frustrating for such a hotel. The hotel has lots of amenities (some we perhaps don't need), a great little lounge, but the main attraction is its proximity to Shinjuku station; Nishishinjuku is fabulous with lots of places to eat, a post office to withdraw the much needed cash, and both metro and train connections. Very easy to navigate. The views from the hotel are also very good.

A couple of minutes walk outside the main lobby are so many restaurants one is totally spoilt for choice. And it is only a 10 min walk to Shinjuku Station. The only ‘complaint’ I have is that our floor (Level 31) is centrally heated so that we could not select air conditioning instead of heating. We found our room quite warm on arrival. This was quickly rectified by the helpful housekeeper who promptly brought us a rotating fan which did the job for us.

They would clean our room even through on one day we placed our make up our room sign outside our door so very close to the 3pm cut off time.

We had little choice for a Saturday night stay, as so many hotels close to transit stations were booked. The Keio had tons of guests everywhere. Tour groups, conferences, was there also a group of figure skating competitors from around the world? Golly. We were a solo family and paid a premium for a basic room on the 26th floor. After a long walk through Shinjuku Park (wonderful but so crowded on a Sunday) and the streets of restaurants and shops, I needed to rest my very tired feet and recently replaced hip. There was no where to sit. The lobby was absolutely packed. But you know, there was so much floor space in that massive hotel, you’d think additional couches would not be difficult to provide. I’d suggest staying away unless you’re with a tour group that could get you a more reasonable room rate and ensure a place to rest, even if only in the tour bus parked just outside.

However this time I booked the “Club Floor” rooms without realising it. As soon as we got to the lobby check in desk, there was a sign indicating that Club Floor rooms (known as Premier Grand) check-ins were on the 45th floor. They quickly ushered us up to check in which also meant we were able to avoid the queue downstairs with the hoards of tourists in their lobby. There are just so many people, tourists and locals alike, in the lobby and everywhere all the time. The place is literally swarming.We sat down to a hot towel and a tea, and they checked us in whilst we relaxed in the lounge. After sorting out a minor misunderstanding with the booking (done through another large booking website) they gave us the keys to our room. You access your floor with a mere tap of the room key on the four panels located around the lift so you don’t need to clamber for the button panel in the front which I thought was a nice touch. This was especially useful as the lifts got quite busy due to some end of year sales event being held on multiple floors in the hotel whilst we were there.The rooms themselves were SO much nicer than the other floors. They were spacious and airy and still smelled new (and not foosty or smoky). The shower/bath tub room was large and separate from the toilet. Needless to say, the amenities were top notch- they had everything you could possibly need from cleansing milk to hair gel. Even the slippers were fluffier.Breakfast came with the room and we had the choice of all the restaurants in the hotel but decided to have it on their club floor lounge area for the spectacular views and to avoid the madding crowds. Although the selection wasn’t huge, their egg station was excellent (or should I say eggcellent). The lounge area, replete with hot and cold refreshments, was opened until 10pm at night- this was a great place to convene before setting off in the morning or in the evening before dinner. Check out was a breeze and all done on the 45th floor. They helped us book our airport limousine bus tickets and handled all the luggage. We were able to sit in the lounge and enjoy a coffee until we had to leave for our bus.Honestly I was never particularly fond of the Keio Plaza hotel- it was just convenient and nostalgic for the parents but this trip made me look at it in a different light. It was probably one of the best hotel stays I’ve had in Tokyo. In short, I would highly recommend you shell out extra for the Premier Grand rooms or choose a different smaller, newer hotel with fewer guests.","Hong Kong, China","i_am_grace_fan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",17,5.0

The lobby seems rather worn out and massified. We stayed at the Grand Premier club level, which was better but not of the quality of the clubs of other hotels. Rooms were a bit small even at the Grand Premier level. The breakfast was fine. The ladies at the reception of the club room were helpful with reservations. There were a couple of men at the entrance of the club that seemed like security and were not nice at all. Hard to understand why there is a need for a threatening security people at the entrance of the club. The bell captain at the lobby was not helpful at all: I asked for the service to transfer the suitcases to another hotel and just told me to look it up on the Internet. By chance I asked the ladies at the club reception and they were able to arrange everything. There is a travel agency at the lobby level with very friendly and helpful staff. The Teppanyaki restaurant was very good and interesting but perhaps overpriced. The hotel is probably good for families with kids.","Uccle, Belgium","mathew2055</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Uccle, Belgium</strong>",52,3.0

This is a large and busy hotel which caters to many tour groups and so we always notice crowds of people moving about at the lobby areas. The staff, however, were plentiful and always at hand to assist.LocationKeio Plaza is located at the Shinjuku west area and is about 10 mins walk from Shinjuku Station. It is located amongst office buildings and it is very near to the Tokyo Metropolitan building where you may head to have a bird’s eye view of the city. There is a fully covered walkway which starts from one of the entrances of the hotel and leads you all the way to the west entrance of Shinjuku Station. This was very useful as the walkway was lined with travelators making handling children and luggage a breeze.RoomWe booked a Standard Twin Room which was large by Japanese standards. They had placed 3 beds even though it was a double room but there was enough space to open large luggages and for children and us to move about. The toilet was well equipped with all the necessary toiletries and also had the “space age” toilet bowls which came heated and with all the bidet controls for washing. All of these were clean and polished making our stay pleasant. They also provide a complementary Smartphone which you can take out during your stay at this hotel. This made navigating using Google Maps a breeze as well.FacilitiesThe hotel has a direct shuttle service to Tokyo Disneyland which was very convenient. You need to reserve seats using their Keio plaza website beforehand and they will hand you the shuttle tickets upon check in. The hotel has 6 restaurants and a convenience store (konbini). We only tried the breakfast buffet restaurant which was reasonable. There are also some Indian and Turkish restaurants which are within walking distance of this hotel and the food at those places was good too.ServiceThis was a busy hotel but the service we received was top notch. I have to commend the Bell Captain and team who were always at hand to assist me with keeping luggage before check in as well as luggage transfer between hotels from Tokyo to Kyoto. Even at 11pm at night, there are a few of them always moving around to ensure that everyone is attended to. They brought our luggages to our rooms, guided us on the room facilities and handled the luggage transfer process for us. All I needed to do was to pass the address of the hotel to them and they did all the work. Overall, our stay here was just for 2 nights and we had booked this primarily for the Disney Shuttle as well as the location being relatively near to Shinjuku Station. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly and we would recommend this hotel for its service and efficiency.","Singapore, Singapore","razorr925</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",10,4.0

The hotel is in a perfect spot in the best district of Tokyo to stay as a tourist. Many things have been said by others already so I will leave you my top tips: 1) Do catch the Limousine bus from either Narita or Hadena airports- it’s £21 each way , comfortable, efficient and goes right to the hotel . Make sure you go online and buy the ticket from the airport to the hotel at least one day before you arrive. Tickets back to the airport can be bought from the hotel concierge 2) If you book a deluxe plaza room you get high floors with excellent views, go to the south tower, larger room and access to the 34th floor lounge with free drinks and snacks - highly recommend 3) don’t worry about breakfast - there are plenty of local cafes - use the exit the other side to the main entrance, cross the road and take your pick - we particularly like Pronto - second turning on the left as you walk up the pedestrian walkway directly opposite the hotel - a quarter of the price charged in the hotel 4) if you use the same entrance and walkway you will arrive at Shinjuku station in less than 10 minutes , take a left and walk to all the shops and nightlife. 5) taxis are very expensive - use the tube- it’s cheap and efficient - signs are all in English - a bit daunting with the amount of people - but easy after the first go!! 6) The hotel provides a smartphone free of charge in your room for your use - has local information , sat nav for walking around and free local and international calls - excellent service 7) standard of English at hotel reception and concierge is very good , elsewhere very little English spoken - signs are in English but you have to do a lot of pointing at English menus , which are widely available 8) we didn’t eat in the hotel , menu is available in the room but prices are hideous, local restaurants are plentiful and much cheaper , when choosing a restaurant don’t forget to look up- many are on the upper floors, we found some excellent Japanese restaurants that were on the upper floors. 9) the hotel bell boys at both entrances will supply you with an umbrella if it is raining 10) Tea and coffee is supplied in your room, there is a fridge, just go to the local 7 Eleven and buy a small carton of milk . 11) The hotel is a pick up point for many of the major tours - another great reason to stay here- it’s professional and easy to join these tours, staff are in the huge lobby area and are looking out for people joining tours12) all staff we interacted with were excellent, efficient, polite and professional. The hotel is nearly 50 years old but is immaculate , our room was clean, modern and in great condition13) I would recommend booking some tours with English speaking guides. We booked through the Viator app and everything ran like clockwork. I recommend the night pub crawl - my favourite tour - Mount Fuji , hakone and bullet rain, full day Tokyo tour. Do the Tokyo tour as soon as you can after arrival , it allows you to get your bearings of the city. The sky tower in Roppongi hills is something you can do yourself on the tube - 10 stops directly on the tube and is recommended . The robot restaurant is bizarre but entertaining - an acquired taste but a must do!! 14) Do walk to the park in Shinjuku , it is excellent Tokyo is amazing if you haven’t been before - a shoppers paradise- but not cheap. Don Quiotte is a great discount retailer that sells just about everything and cheaper than the flash department stores - it’s crazy busy and cramped aisles though!! There are just about every flavour of kit kats available - you have to try them If you go to Mount Fuji in the winter wrap up warm , it was -10 at 2300m Enjoy your stay ","London, United Kingdom","AlanM262</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",214,5.0

Stayed in the Princess Kitty room 2250 (these room availability was not released until about August) for my November stay.We stayed 4 nights, a tour company, Inside Japan booked these rooms for us. The hotel did not send a final invoice to Inside Japan, and Inside Japan did not realize to follow-up. Needless to say, during check-in, we were kept waiting around for nearly 90 minutes before front desk assigned us a room. They were able to get in touch with Inside Japan about receiving final payment.We were triple occupancy so it was basically a third bed in a double bed room. The room is as you'd imagine, very Hello Kitty. According to the website, there were certain things you can take with you such as the bathroom amenities, the slippers, the desk note portfolio and the doll on the bed. There was complimentary ""bow"" shaped water bottles nightly. The amenities were replenished nightly with house keeping. Oddly, the Hello Kitty doll was not replenished after the second night.

Amazingly, complimentary use of cell phone with data and certain calling allowance including international cities. No bar soap though, only liquid soap.Spacious room, good shower with perfect water pressure and draining.Our room rates included breakfast so we tried all 4 options available including room service with a Hello Kitty spread.

I had booked the hotel via a travel agent from Singapore and I was initially provided a regular 3-star hotel and after reviewing the amenities, I asked my travel agent to upgrade my accommodation and was given Keio Plaza Hotel.CHECK-INWe had arrived at the hotel at about 5pm (local Tokyo time) and it was approximately a 40 minute drive from Haneda International Airport to the property. There were many front desk staff manning the counters and check-in was swift. They only requested for our passports and our room was already available and prior to going up, they made sure to explain every detail to us, to ensure that we have a complete stay. It took no more than 10-15 minutes to complete check-in. Almost all of the front desk staff can speak English. Even the concierge services boys can speak basic English.ROOMI booked a standard room because I was out of the room most of the time and I was pleasantly surprised that the room is spacious, very clean and had comfortable beds. They didn't have extra pillows in the cupboards unless you were staying in a triple room but a call down to guest services was all it took and they quickly sent us extra pillows. The bathroom was also clean with good shower foam etc and I must add that the highlight of the bathroom was the ""smart toilet"". There was heating on the toilet seat as the temperature while I was in Tokyo (morning) was about 9 - 13 degree celcius and coming from Singapore, that kind of temperature was extremely cold. There was the bidet too and rear end dryer.BREAKFASTI believe almost all hotels in Japan would use the breakfast coupon system as the hotel in Osaka that I had stayed in also used breakfast coupons. In Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo, there was three options of restaurants that we could visit for breakfast; (1) Western, (2) Japanese and (3) mix Japanese and Western. The first few days, we had taken our breakfast at the Western restaurant which had a shorter queue and as the name implies, the spread catered to the Western palate and the bread spread was large. LAUNDRY SERVICEI had used their laundry service and it was efficient. If you submit your laundry was washing before 10am, it would be ready within the same day by 6pm unless it was heavy laundry. This is unlike hotels in Malaysia or Singapore where they would only return the laundry the following day and this is the efficiency of the Japanese people. The laundry would be wrapped nicely in a plastic bag individually and you can have the option to starch your laundry as well. If the shirt has a collar, they would put a cardboard bowtie to keep the collar ""standing and crisp"".OTHERSThe hotel is walking distance to Shinjuku Train station and also Keio Department Store (huge department store with 5 floors that links to the tran station). Walking to the train station took only 10 minutes from the rear entry. The Tourist Information Centre to activate our JapanRail Pass was opposite the train station, also walking distance from the hotel. Convenience is definitely a plus point for choosing this property for your stay in Tokyo, Shinjuku. As I was travelling to Osaka on check-out, there was a luggage transfer service at the hotel lobby, at the concierge area. We dropped off our luggage before 5pm and it was delivered to Osaka the following day and when we arrived at our Hotel in Osaka, it was already there waiting for us and when we checked-in, they handed our bags to us. The concierge staff can speak basic English, which makes conversing with them easy. There are many convenience stores (Lawsons) nearby and some open 24 hours as well. OVERALL & RECOMMENDATIONI enjoyed my stay in Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo and on my next trip to Japan in 2019, I'll definitely stay at Keio Plaza Hotel Tokyo. I would also personally recommend this hotel. Unfortunately, it's a little pricey but the stay would be an enjoyable and relaxing stay..!!

I like the location of this hotel as it is close to the shopping and restaurant areas; and accessible to the parks if you had time to go.

It was hard to tell the difference from one room type to another but we were given a large, spacious room in the new tower with large windows. The bed was giant and while a bit firm, was comfortable. We appreciated all the items provided free of charge (toothbrush, hairbrush, hair ties, etc) in the bathroom which were restocked daily. I used the gym twice which was not tucked away in the basement of a hotel which is usually the case, but had giant windows overlooking the street which was cool. Machines were precor: nice, new and never too crowded. We didn’t opt for breakfast but there are several nearby coffee shops and places to grab a bite. We also appreciated the two water bottles refilled in the room daily.

I chose Keio Plaza again primarily because of its location. I prefer Shinjuku to the other big Tokyo hubs and Keio Plaza is really well located close to Shinjuku station. It takes about 8 to 10 minutes to walk. You can walk through the streets between the hotel and station or use a well lit covered walkway between the two, which avoids the need to negotiate traffic and is a boon in bad weather. The walkway has a moving belt 'travelator' for most of the way although it only operates one way (ie you can use it when travelling from the station to the hotel but not in reverse). It is well worth checking the location of the walkway with staff.This time I booked a renovated Queen bed room in the South Tower and had a complimentary upgrade to a King Bed room. The room was spacious and well equipped. There is a fair sized room safe. There is also free WiFi which works well but is complicated to access initially. On arrival the porter who sees you to your room will probably offer to set up WiFi for you and I suggest you accept.There are a range of restaurants in the hotel and if you include breakfast in your booking you will be given vouchers which you can use in one of four different restaurants. My recommendation is to use 'The Glass Court' buffet restaurant which caters for a good range of both western and Japanese food styles.One other consideration. If you take a room in the south tower you have a reasonable chance of getting a view of Mount Fuji between the towers of the municipal offices across from the hotel (see picture attached).",Australia,"JeremyPaul99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",144,4.0

It's a very large hotel (1,450 rooms), and spent a few years as Tokyo's tallest building in the early 1970s. Despite its size, we didn't experience long waits for elevators, check-in or check-out, as the hotel seems well-organised. There are 18 food and/or drink venues in the hotel, each offering different styles of cuisine, although we didn't actually try any of them as we spent our time exploring other culinary options in Tokyo.Our room on one of the higher floors had a nice view of the Tokyo Metropolitan Tower. I had specifically requested a non-smoking room, because the hotel offers some smoking rooms, so keep this in mind when making a reservation. The room was clean and reasonably sized (not huge, but I think it was only a standard room and the hotel has many other options). The bed was comfortable and the WiFi worked efficiently (they give you a specific login code that you have to re-enter every 24h). Good shower pressure. One particularly nice feature: the rooms come with a complimentary smartphone that you can take out + about in Tokyo for internet access on the move (it asks you to acknowledge T+C if you lose/damage it), and you can use the phone for domestic and some international calls.The hotel is located a few minutes' walk from the central west exit of Shinjuku station. When coming straight from the station there's an underground passage that drops you out right by the hotel, and when coming from other main Shinjuku areas (e.g. Kabukicho / Golden Gai) it's relatively easy to navigate above ground past the station and walk over to the hotel, so there's no real need for taxis/subway in that area.Overall I would recommend the Keio Plaza, particularly if you can search around and find a good deal.","Chicago, Illinois","rich_coleman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",35,4.0

We were worried our room might not be ready until normal check-in time in the afternoon, but they had it ready for us! We highly recommend staying in one of their Club Rooms which gave us access to its Club Lounge and their private concierge service. It was amazing being able to check-in at their Club Lounge on the top of the hotel's tower whilst having some breakfast from their buffet. The food options at the Lounge were also perfect for our baby and they were able to provide baby friendly alternatives when we asked.There were so many on site restaurant options which were great when we were dealing with a hungry baby. I loved using their new baby room which had private cubicles and sofas. This made changing my baby and feeding her very easy and comfortable.

There were a multitude of dining options — varying levels of formality, varying wait times for breakfast, different cuisines and different price points. Breakfast opened early in the morning, helping those of us with jet lag and Disneyland buses to catch. Jurin, Glass Court, Tempura and the convenience store all had their merits. I was really impressed when one morning the staff set up an alternative breakfast room in the Sky Lounge when the line for Jurin was around 20 min. A woman informed us while we were in line and helped us to get there. By doing so, our family was able to eat a good, thorough breakfast before our tour began. The South Tower renovated rooms were significantly nicer than the Main Tower rooms. We stayed in both. The staff also speaks very good English and many westerners seem to choose this very hotel.

Both times we stayed overnight in premium level rooms which had a separate place to check in (on 45) as well as a separate area for the included breakfast. The premium rooms I believe are floors 37-42. The room itself was large and comfortable with a incredible view of the city. The tub and shower area were great and we drew multiple baths while we were there. There is a social time from 5-7 PM each evening on the 45th floor which had a nice selection of food, wine and beer. Be sure to go to the more comfortable (left) side opposite where the food spread is laid out as there are comfortable couches, sake and draft beer available vs just the tables where they serve the breakfast. The breakfast is good and I suggest trying the eggs Benedict if you like that. One thing we really liked about the hotel was the surprisingly inexpensive in room massage option for ~50 minutes. The hotel will do it for 2 people at once if you call far enough ahead of time. We found one night we could get 2 people massaged at once with 90 minutes lead time and the other we could only get 1 masseuse with 3 hours lead time. All a question of availability I guess. It cost something like ¥5000 per person for 1 hour which is a great deal! It is a bit of a PITA to book as you need to call the front desk and get transferred around a few times until you get the “massage desk” and their English is subpar but, take my word for it, it is well worth it. The staff on the 45 floor is pretty good about making dinner reservations if you tell them where but IMHO not very good at making recommendations. Use TA to find where you want to go and then show the front desk your first and second ranked suggestions on your phone and have them call on your behalf. The two nights we were guests of the hotel we had them get us reservations at the fancy sushi restaurant in the hotel (which was delicious but very expensive) and the second night we asked them make reservations for us at a highly rated but far less expensive sushi restaurant 3 blocks from the hotel. I think I might be hesitant to stay at the non premium portion of the hotel as it seemed like every time we ended up in the first floor lobby or in the shopping sections on the first few floors it felt very crowded and unpleasant. The premium experience was great and not terribly expensive and the views are killer. If this helped you to make a choice, please don’t forget to click on the helpful button below the review.

Much of what we wanted to do was between the Shinjuku and Shibuya areas so this location was perfect for us to fit in all the sights in a short amount of time. The hotel is huge and has so much to offer in itself I wish we had an extra day or two just to experience it all. The property is split into two towers. We stayed in the South Tower which is the older of the two and found the rooms to be clean, spacious and suitably appointed. We were in a corner room on a higher floor and had wonderful views over Tokyo. The beds were really comfortable and the amenities provided were the most generous I’ve come across, which included the standard items plus different kinds of face cleansers and moisturizer, toothpaste, razor, a hair brush and so much more. Each tower has a lounge on the top floor offering guests complimentary beverages and snacks. There are several newspapers available in various languages. Their flat white coffee from the machine in the lounge was one of the best I’ve had; I think the milk was a sweet cream…so good. Staff were polite, helpful and communication was not an issue. The property offers many different dining options right on site. We ate at the Kagari Restaurant which was a wonderful experience, I’ll review that separately. There is a convenience store on site as well which was handy. This property has a few speciality Hello Kitty decorated rooms which my husband was not keen to stay in but they were kind enough to show to me since one was available. The attention to Hello Kitty detail was impressive so if you’re a fan you might want to consider this option. In addition to all the restaurants and bars the property can organise a selection of experiences right on site including a tea ceremony, flower arranging, origami and the opportunity to experience wearing a full wedding kimono. Unfortunately, we didn’t have enough time to book an experience but would definitely consider it on our next trip. We did take the shuttle organised by the hotel back to the airport which was hassle free and not too expensive. Aside from the great location, this hotel had a nice balance of making overseas visitors feel comfortable without compromising the authentic Japanese experience.

The Keio Plaza Hotel is such a place. It has no heart and feels terribly old-fashioned. It's somewhere to sleep and little else. There's no desire to linger in the lobby, which I believe is the heart of any hotel.I had a Club Level room. The room was smart and more modernised than the rest of the hotel, and it had great views towards Shinjuku. The bed was good as was the shower /bathroom. But the wardrobe space was ridiculously small, and there was nowhere adequate for empty suitcases despite the room being a reasonable size by Tokyo standards.What was kind of sad is that the Club Level has a very large inviting lounge with fabulous panoramic views - one of the biggest I've encountered on my travels. But despite the hotel being full I only ever saw 3 or 4 people in it. So it's rather soulless, which is sad. The food offerings and drinks were sufficient.If you need to be near Shinjuku then the location is excellent. It's walking distance to Isetan, Takashimaya, etc. I sadly had no option but to check-out early as the hotel lost its WIFI for over 12 hours during the daytime, so I was rather at a loss to communicate with my Japanese clients via computer who use software to communicate with me in English. The loss of WIFI for a period of time is unacceptable in a large Japanese hotel in the heart of Tokyo. So I moved on to another hotel, which fortunately for me was much better on many levels.There's absolutely no reason for me to ever return to the Keio Plaza. There are far superior Tokyo hotels to be found. But it was a perfectly acceptable hotel dependant on your needs. There was nothing wrong with it, it just felt rather dated, and not able to deliver the Tokyo experience I enjoy. I would rather pay more and leave a hotel with a memorable experience, than pay less and have something mediocre..",London,"Serial_Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",441,3.0

The hotel provided a baggage minding service (free) as well as a shuttle bus service to the airport (NOT free but worth it).

Also the area around is lively with lots of shops and restaurants In terms of hotel itself it’s a large and largely anonymous tower block building with a good range and amenities although restaurants especially are very expensive even if you use discount vouchers that hotel gives you on arrival . So we didn’t use any of them The main bar on lower ground floor is ok but also pricey and not particularly attractive lacking any kind of window or view . The Sky Lounge on the 7th floor is an exception with a terrific view over the city and is well worth visiting notwithstanding the price of drinks . Both bars ( like many places in Japan)still allow smoking so be aware of you find this unpleasant . Other amenities such as their open air swimming pool ( a reason I booked in the first place ) are perfectly fine although I find it very difficult to understand how they justify an additional quite steep daily charge ( something like £17) fo use of the fitness / spa facilities . Also the pool doesn’t open until 9 which isn’t terribly convenient t for business or leisure travellers who like me like to get an early morning swim in to start their day . Rooms are fine , clean and reasonably sized but not in any sense new or modern and maybe considered somewhat tired in terms of decor .

It is a very very beautiful building , but everything is from the 1970s-1980s ..... the pool is perfectly located surrounded by Shinjuku skyscrapers and has so much potential, but it again is old fashioned . The attendants are over zealous , was asked to remove my sunglasses in the pool .... which even though I understand, was annoying ; then the deck chairs are cheap plastic ....the pool attendants wear really ugly uniforms which look like a provincial family sports facility - there are no drinks allowed at the pool , it’s kind of a Family type atmosphere and not chic !! Great situation , wonderful location - surrounded by stunning skyscrapers , though not for the chic minded traveller .. when compared to Hotel pools like The Shilla Seoul , this pool is not of this era !! The charge of 4000yen seems a bit steep for the standard of design !! Also the awful blue towels which have seen better days don’t cover the lounge chairs ..... one thing I really hated was the Terry towelling rugs on the changing room floors which were not clean !! the drinks in the bar were served with awful Kombini type sandwiches and the sparkling wine was flat .... again the furniture , And even the Zen garden seen from the bar looked like a display at a homecenter .

The cost to stay there was £400 per night so we expected luxury! Well we were totally and utterly disappointed! We realise that the price charged could have been due to the cruise company also making a profit and have contacted them regarding this matter however the whole experience at this hotel was pretty dreadful. We were transported to the hotel by coach from the ship ( including a city tour) and when we arrived outside the hotel there were no porters available to take the cases of any of the passengers , so all of our cases were left lying on the pavement while we were herded into the hotel to join the longest Hotel queue for check in we have ever seen. When, after an hour, we arrived at the desk we were told by a receptionist who spoke little English, that as we had booked through NCL we couldn’t check in there but at a different area. We were not alone at experiencing this! Possibly NCL should have made us aware of this! We had to find our own luggage( piled up in the lobby) and take it with us as no porters were yet available! When we eventually got our key we were full of anticipation to see our luxurious room! We could not have been more disappointed! The room was basic at best. It was small and cramped with not a single thing to recommend it! We have had much better in a Premier Inn in the U.K. at a fraction of the cost. The safe was in a cupboard at floor level so we had to go on to the floor to use it ( not ideal with arthritis)! As we were on the 18th floor the view was interesting especially at night with the city lights on. We headed out to explore the area and to be fair the hotel is in a fairly interesting area of Japan but there are very few shops to browse. There are many little diners ( we had uncooked Chicken in one), chemist shops and electrical outlets but not much else. The station however is within easy walking distance , though the station itself is so vast that it is hard to find the correct platform etc. As people who have travelled widely we are generally able to make ourselves understood or be able to read signs etc but there is very little English spoken or even understood so it makes things a little difficult! When we went for breakfast on our first morning we again had to queue for ages. The breakfast room was crowded and the buffet style breakfast was pretty average. The next 2 mornings we chose to eat in the American diner within the hotel as it was not so busy and the food was reasonably good. We ate in that restaurant in the evening and it was quite enjoyable! The service was pleasant and efficient and as residents we were given a discount. We went up to the bar at the top of the hotel for a drink as there is a great view of the area but as we were not eating there, we were not offered a window seat and we found the staff quite brusque and unfriendly! When we explored the hotel further we discovered gorgeous ( very expensive) restaurants on the basement level. The decor is very attractive in the public areas. There are also little shops with an ATM available in one general store where we bought some souvenirs and gifts so in that respect the Hotel was good. There is also a travel agents which can arrange tours but they were not suitable for us. The Hop on/Hop Off bus isn’t!! You have to get on at the office near Central Station in Central Tokyo and do the full round tour!! Unusual!! We are still undecided whether we like Tokyo or not! Maybe we need to return one day to make a decision but we certainly won’t be returning to the Keio Plaza as our overriding impression of this hotel is one of disappointment.

Check in was fast and we were lucky to be able to have a room upgrade with a gorgeous view of the Tokyo Government Bldg ( bldg lights up during evening). We were also allowed early check in because the room was ready (fortunate indeed). Tip: reserve your Limousine Bus Seats with Concierge for departure date. We bought in advance our return to airport bus seats at Narita during our arrival (they have promos like free 24hr subway cards) Everyone speaks very good English. For Breakfast we had choice of 3 different restaurants, one serving Japanese breakfast, American Buffet, and another one which I recommend is the Glass Court serving both American & Japanese Buffet Breakfast. Service was very good considering the big size of the hotel and its many clients. Elevators were fast. They offer complimentary Smartphone in our room which you can take out on tours to access internet and get free calls everywhere. Beds were very comfortable. Rooms were large, clean and good branded toiletries were provided. I would truly say that for the experience we had with Keio, the high price we paid was commensurate.

However when I arrived after a long haul flight on 16 July at 08:30 am there was no room available. The hotel did not even offer a drink, a place to work or even a place to shower. Fortunately some of the people in my team checked in the day before so I could shower in their room. Now waiting in the Lobby when so can checkin but I also need to travel for meetings. I hope I can check in before. We have a meeting with the sales team of Keio plaza on Wednesday 18 July and I am going to explain what happened and may say that this is the last time my team stayed here.

Most disappointing was the check in experience as we discovered about the pool charges and hotel staff were completely unwilling to do anything to accomodate us.

We traveled with 2 young children ages 3 and 6. Choosing a hotel in Tokyo is a daunting process with so many options and a wide range of price points. Ultimately, I chose Keio for its central location next to the Shinjuku train station, capitalizing on having fewer train transfers with two youngsters on hand. (We would be traveling to Hakone from Tokyo and Shinjuku was easily linked to Tokyo or Shinagawa JR stations if you have a JR pass). It is also a direct stop for the Airport Limousine route. The other big draw was the free shuttle to Disneyland/Disney Sea, as the reality of making multiple train transfers during rush hour morning to get to Disney with two youngsters was probably going to be a nightmare. (On Hyperdia, that train commute to Disney would have taken about an hour.) That being said, when we arrived, it was impressively upscale with full bell service when we walked in the door. The room was much larger than I expected (and read about compared to other Tokyo accommodations). We had three double sized beds in a room plus a comfortable size bathroom. The room was clean and had cute kid toiletries for the kiddos. It was walking distance to large malls (about a 10 minute walk to Keio Mall), which I used to pick up take-out dinners at the basement food floors when the kids were too jetlagged to go out to dinner. Also, it's walking distance from Shin Udon, which was the BEST udon we had while in Japan! The neighborhood was lively and energetic at night, felt very safe to walk around and browse the many food options. As I mentioned, it's walking distance to Shinjuku train station, which is a JR station as well as a local subway station. Beware the size of this station - it often felt like walking through and airport terminal and is easily half a mile walk from one end to the other end, but I digress. The hotel itself did not have many affordable dining options, except for the small minimart on the basement floor where I picked up some onigiri for some light snacks.

Just need to caution about its hotel stringent policy. I booked a twin room without breakfast for my friend and me via an online hotel website (not the official hotel website). When I checked in, the hotel staff told me that my booking was only for one person and I had to pay extra near 6000 yen per night, irrespective of the fact that I booked and paid for a twin room. I explained to the hotel staff that I paid for a twin room when booking and I expected it would allow two persons to stay in the twin room. Unfortunately, my assumption was wrong. They insisted that I had to pay the extra fees because I did not mention that there would be a double occupancy during my booking.

There are multiple restaurants within the complex, but I didn’t get the feeling that they had anything to do with the hotel. Breakfast is located within two of these. I opted for the western orientated option and was happy with the choices and value for money. My room was a long way from reception. It was large and very clean, although the bed was very hard.

To my surprise this hotel was great and I would definitely recommend staying here! The hotel staff knows basic English so they can help answer your questions. The hotel has multiple restaurants and a convenience store. There's also a 24 hour grocery store nearby that's a 10 minute walk from the hotel (Maruetsu Petit Nishishinjuku).It's about a 10 minute walk to Shinjuku Station and a five minute walk from Tochomae Station (Oedo line). The walk to Sinjuku Station isn't long. It only feels long if you take a route that has a lot of cross streets.The room was great and it had a nice view. I wish my room came with an iron and ironing board. You have to request for one if you need it. I did not get the breakfast package when I booked my room. On the day I wanted to eat the buffet breakfast at the Glass Court, I was able to pay there. The breakfast was good and if you think you'll eat breakfast at the hotel everyday, I would get the breakfast package.The airport limousine bus stops at this hotel. To return to the airport using the airport limo, you must ask someone at the bell captain desk to reserve a seat on the bus for you. Check out is at 11 am, but if your flight is later, you can ask the staff at the bell captain desk hold your luggage until your flight. I had to leave Tokyo for Narita Airport at 1 pm, so I asked the staff at the bell captain's desk to hold my luggage from 11 am to 1 pm. I just walked around Shinjuku until I had to leave.The only con I have is with the hotel WiFi.

The universal rooms are larger with handbars and special seats in the bathrooms. While beds are electrically adjustable. We couldn’t be any happier or rather Mum couldn’t be any happier. The Keio Plaza is an older property that is quite well known both in and outside of Japan. Many international visitors were noticed. In addition, it is also where some Japanese couples choose to hold their weddings. Do watch out for the happy couples especially on Saturdays. Located in Shinjuku, it’s a short walk to Shinjuku station and all the shopping malls. And plenty of eating places near by although the hotel also has some excellent restaurants. In addition to being a stopping point for the Airport Limousine bus, as a Disney partner hotel, there are daily buses to and back from Tokyo Disneyland. But do get your tickets early.

The room was very large, very comfortable and extremely clean. The lobby check in was fast and efficient. Everyone was friendly and tried their best to communicate with us. You couldn’t ask for a better location for visiting Tokyo. It’s only a few short blocks away from the Shinjuku train station. But those few blocks between gives you the serenity and peace from the maddening pace of the rest of Tokyo. We are New Yorkers and found Tokyo to be far more intense then our little city called New York so we appreciated the tranquility by the Keio plaza hotel.They have a tour desk that can arrange for many different tours of the city and day trips. Also a big plus is that you can take the limo bus from Narita airport directly to and from the hotel.In the lower level they have a convenience store that stays open very late and has many snacks, drinks, and even souvenirs. All for about the same amount you would pay at local 7-Eleven convenience stores.They also have many restaurants on that level. We did not eat at any of them but they all looked beautiful.If you are trying to decide on a hotel in Tokyo, this one is a no-brainer because you will have a comfortable stay if you choose the Keio plaza hotel.","New York City, New York","michelef147</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,5.0

I had asked for a late check out by one hour due to my train being a few hours ahead of the check out time and was told I would have to pay ¥4000 to do so. The check out time at this hotel is fairly early and at 11.00AM and no matter the times I asked, and even spoke to the hotel manager at the time hoping for a solution, I was given a firm no.

There was a good city view but we all found the rooms rather small and claustrophobic. The bathroom looked like one of those fabricated units, very dated and the shower was in the bath - no walk in shower! So for us the room was the main negative aspect of our stay. We had access to the Luxe Lounge in the South Tower. The canapé offering in the lounge is very limited though they offer a good range of drinks including Japanese whiskey. Be advised it closes sharp at 7:00PM and reverts to a tea lounge.Breakfast could be taken either in the Glass Court or Jurin - both on the 2nd floor. The Glass Court had an excellent buffet offering, helpful staff and it offers a comfortable setting. By contrast Jurin has a more Western food offering and is decidedly less attractive. There can be an occasional queue at the Glass Court but it does move quickly.The main bar called 'Brilliant' is inviting and service very attentive.

There seemed to be a wifi problem: my phone wouldn't hook up at all and my wife's emails from there weren't received until we changed hotels; however, our iPad was fine.We had access to the Plaza Lounge - like our room, in the south tower, NOT the main tower where the good lounge and best rooms are - where the drinks for the 2-hour bar time were fine but the food disappointing. On one of our 3 visits, EVERY canape contained fish - to which my wife is HIGHLY allergic. To the staff's credit, they did find a few non-fishy ones for her, but it should not have been necessary.The hotel is, however, only about a 10-minute walk from Shinjuku station. We stayed in the area, in fact, because the next train we were using left from there AND it is on the direct line from Narita Airport.

It's about a 7 minute walk from Shinjuku station. There is also a subway station (Toca-mae) about two minutes walk. We found getting around easy - enough signs in English and staff happy to help out.There are numerous eateries nearby especially towards the station and on the other side of the rail line in an area called Kabuki-cho-neon. I think this means the 'Neon Light District' - it's certainly terrific at night with those neon lights blazing and huge screensWe didn't have the buffet breakfast - instead heading to a nearby bakery for delicious goodies each morning. One evening, my wife and I went to the Hotel's Saki Bar. This was awesome. We were the only people there. The drinks waiter took so much time to explain the various types of Saki - we had a sparkling then a chilled and finally a warm Saki. Each so different - the food accompaniments were also great. On our final day we had the High Tea on L45 of the Hotel. The views are great and High Tea is terrific. Unlike many others we've been to, you can try numerous different types of tea during your three hour visit. The food on the trays was excellent and varied. Highly recommend this as a treat and also recommend that you book - esp if you want to get a table at the window.Another useful service is the bus service to Haneka International Airport.

We arrived at the hotel around 11am, we fully understood that we could not get in the room until after 2pm, however we thought we could at least go through the check in process of passport/credit card details to save time later as we were tired and wanted to get into the room as soon as possible. But no this was not allowed we would have to come back at 2 although they could hold our bags, so after lunch we were there right on 2pm. Unfortunately so was everyone else, with a queue snaking around the length of the front desk we finally were given our passes at 2.45 and were told our bags would arrive shortly. One hour later they were still not there so I went down to the baggage storage and they were brought up immediately.The room was ok although what was annoying to us was that for 3 of us, my wife, myself and son, they would not give us a double room with roll away, they had to give us 3 single beds !. Apparently this is what happens when 3 are in the room at the Keio Plaza. I also get that many Japanese people prefer harder beds but one of our beds was like trying to sleep on concrete, really uncomfortable and not a great nights sleep was had. Otherwise the room was basic but well kept.We used Lumine and Glass Court restaurants on the lower level and the Aurora sky lounge, all were very nice particularly Lumine.The Keio Plaza is obviously a hotel for groups, so there were big numbers and tour groups continually walking around the very busy lobby area. With the large numbers it certainly takes away from the sophistication of a initially polished looking hotel.Position wise it is perfectly located to Shinjuku and other restaurants. It is approx 8-10 minutes walk from the metropolis of Shinjuku station and no more than 5 minutes from Tochomae station.All up a good hotel but to me lacks a wow factor and one that I would recommend more for groups than families.","Melbourne, Australia","MartinC27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",8,3.0

The last stay was the worst experience. One good thing about the hotel is that the location is great, in Shinjuku, close to the trains station walking distance to restaurants, bars, shops. They have good restaurants and bars (the one on the top of the hotel is particularly impressive) but they are quite expensive. Not a problem since you could walk to an area with a lot of places to eat/ drink. Front desk is quite strange- they really don't care about you. I know that they are a huge hotel but still they are processing you in a very mechanical way, no interest for your issues. Very strange. I tried to communicate with them but they made very clear to me that they don't care about what I want. There are 2 types of rooms: ""'old"" ones and the ""new""ones (redone recently). The old ones have old furniture and they really look used. The rooms are very clean. Breakfast is good and you could choose 3 restaurants that offer this service.Since is a quite expensive hotel I believe that the value for money is really not there. On the other hand Tokyo is a great city and the people are very nice.","New York City, New York","Emilian131973</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,2.0

It was ok but I question the value.Breakfast.I was excited as I was looking forward to a buffet similar to what other countries in the region offer. It was ok, but not at the expected level. The disappointment was instant coffee only. There is a reasonable coffee machine in the Luxe lounge but only instant in a restaurant. Strange! Once again I question the value.Check Out.I lucked out here too. I questioned the rate per night and all I received in return was “talk to your travel agent”. Absolute and total brush off. Had she spent 5 minutes going over the invoice, everything would have been different. There is a quoted rate per night plus there are fees/charges/taxes per night. This could have been handled better, but I was dealing with another Robot.No issues on the second check out.Overall.The hotel is in a great location. The Limousine bus picks up and drops off at the hotel. Nobody was rude, but there is no warmth from the staff. All in all I would say it was just OK. Would I stay here again? Yes! But in a normal room and I will have breakfast outside the hotel. I find it difficult to see the value in the high end product and price.","Melbourne, Australia","Milan1111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",19,3.0

Suddenly a waiter walked towards me and in a loud exasperated tone, said in broken English “We have guests eating breakfast. The children cannot run around. Is ok?!?!” Then he stomped off before I could even say that these weren’t my kids running around. While I empathize with the service staff n try my best to keep my own boys in check in public places, I do not appreciate being yelled at by a service personnel. Furthermore, these were not even my kids. When I approached the restaurant manager to complain, the offensive waiter came forward to apologize while his manager stood smiling nonchalantly behind him. As someone who works in the retail industry, I do not think the manager’s behavior is appropriate as well. He clearly understood English as he was seating all the guests with a quick overview of the buffet options, and answering any questions they had.We stayed in 6 ryokans and this hotel in our 10-day trip.

It was probably one of my best decisions to make for a late night credit card purchase because this hotel was ABSOLUTELY amazing for our first time stay in Tokyo! My fiance and I stayed here in mid-February (off season) and the staff was incredibly nice and accommodating. We stayed in the South Tower in the Plaza Superior Queen room, which seemed to be quieter and less people than the Main Tower. The room itself was spacious, with a safe box (bolted to the closet) and, on a clear morning, we can see a hint of Mt. Fuji in the distance. We also got a free upgrade when we stayed here a second time at the end of our trip, which was so nice of them! We even checked in at ten minutes before check-in time and we got our upgraded room within minutes. The bathroom also provided shampoo/conditioner/body wash that wasn't generic and I think the lotion was from Crabtree and Evelyn.One of the BEST things about this hotel is that it provided a 'Handy' phone (actually named 'Handy') where you can use to travel basically anywhere using Google Maps, so we didn't need to use our sim and data to navigate around as much. You can't go on the internet with it, but can make international calls for free.Also, it was very easy to get to and from the two main airports (Narita and Haneda) because the pick-up/drop-off for the airport limousine bus is at the main entrance. Plus there is also a 'Good Neighbor Shuttle Bus' to Tokyo Disneyland (free but need to reserve in advance) which we used.The location is also close to Starbucks, 7-Eleven (our go-to place for breakfast and snacks), and many restaurants. Plus, the Shinjuku station is a main station so you can basically take any line (local, JR or Tokyo metro) to go anywhere in the city. We also felt safe walking around the neighborhood in the early morning and wee hours of the night.If you want convenience, relief, some luxury, and great service, this hotel would be right for you.

There were 11 of us in the group. I understand it's a busy time just after New Year so waiting half an hour in the queue to check in was probably not unreasonable. Also given that we were a large group, it might take longer than usual having to go through 11 passports. However, I still couldn't believe it took one and half hours before we were given the keys to our rooms. Despite the long waiting period, we were given the wrong number of rooms and the wrong number of beds per room. Meaning we all had to re-shuffle between several floors. Not fun with little kids in our group after a couple hours standing like sardines in the bullet train.The inconvenience and lack of customer service did not end here.1. On our first night at Japan, we stayed at the Hyatt in Osaka. My son left a teddy bear there and the hotel was kind enough to inform us and offered to courier the teddy bear to Keio Plaza. The courier cost 800 yen. Brilliant service from Hyatt! The check in person who took 1.5 hrs to check us in, couldn't charge 800 yen to our room and continued to bug us after we got sorted in our rooms for payment as we were rushing to get to a tourist venue before it closed thanks to the super long check in process. Meanwhile, there was still a huge queue at check in. 2. The process of returning the keys from the incorrect rooms also made me feel it was not worth bothering at all. We thought we do the right thing by returning them as soon as we realised the mixup. In return, they tried to charge us for extra keys and breakfast vouchers they didn't give us.The lack of efficiency and customer service is profound. You would not expect this sort of treatment for the price you pay!!!On the only positive note, the customer service lady we raised the issues with, and her manager, were very apologetic, but we got the feeling it's not the first time they've heard the problems.","Sydney, Australia","max1ne2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",2,1.0

Chose it for its central location in Shinjuku, which is a great neighborhood for general Tokyo tourism. Right across the street from the Tokyo Metropolitain Government building with its popular observation tower, it is also right next to Shinjuku station, a main subway hub. And this is key, because the best (really the only) way to get around Tokyo, and in fact, all of Japan is on the well-organized, efficient and low cost subway and train system. My initial thought on the downside of the Keio Plaza is that it is a massively large hotel with tons of rooms and people milling about the huge lobby at all hours. I think they must have over 10 restaurants, so lots of facilities, but I was worried about the hustle and bustle, which is why I usually pick smaller, boutique hotels. HOWEVER, we alleviated this problem by booking the Premium Club floor, which are several floors in the top part of the hotel, thereby giving us access to a special facility on the 45th floor, for check-in, concierge services and private breakfast area. Much quieter and certainly more upscale than the masses lining up for the buffet breakfast in the lobby. Our breakfast buffet was lovely, and they also served free cocktails and hors-d'ouevres between 5-7 pm. The room we had was spacious, well-designed, new and lovely. It really had everything we needed. So in my opinion the upgraded Premium Club is the only way to go at the Keio Plaza.

Location wise is not good, yes there is an underground passageway to the subway (you need to use the back door which no one in th the hotel informed me) and passageway to JR station (again the hotel back entrance to reach the JR station) but it’s a long walk to reach the JR/Subway gate (10-15 mins walk).Upon check-in, they won’t allow you to check in until 2 pm. You can only drop your luggage, definitely no check in allowed. Service upon check-in was good, but checking out was different matter. I found that Japanese hotel staff tend to be cold and reserved. As a hotel located in the middle of Tokyo with foreign visitor staying in, wouldn’t be nice to ask the guest how was their stay etc. I brought heavy suitcases after check out yet no one asked me did I need help with suitcases and I’ve to ask the hotel doorman by myself that I need to get the taxi (again, no warm service)The bathroom is dated, you feel like going back to the 1970s with low ceiling and yellow color wall painting. Bedroom mattress are hard and just okay. Certainly this hotel needs much improvement both in rooms and services. And some people said they got Loccitane bathroom amenities, what I got just hotel branded bathroom amenities.In my opinion, there are other hotel in Tokyo with much cheaper price and centrally located.

Maybe they respond better to customers being polite to them rather than being surly, as some other reviewers have commented?The only negative, and one that is common everywhere in Tokyo that we are no longer used to in England, is the fact that you can smoke in the hotel. The bars were smoky, and a little on the expensive side, as you’d expect for this grade of hotel.

My previous stay was in Osaka and I was very impressed with Swissotel (see my review). Keio Plaza I would rank as equally impressive. This is a big hotel with multiple restaurants to choose from, though I only got to try the breakfast buffet at Jurin and the Glass Court. I would rate these as average for a hotel considering the price. You can also go to Starbucks accross the street or the other breakfast joints beside it. Check in / out was a breeze and hassle free given the multiple counters. Since I was with my family, we got a total of 4 rooms. My room was a twin standard with my two kids right next door. As we travelled during the holidays and only reserved two months before, the hotel was fully occuppied which resulted in our rooms being on the smoking floor and had no connecting door. I found the room to be large (for Japan Standards) and nicely decorated. It didn't seem dated nor dull. Beds were comfy and firm with the pillows being on the softer side. Bathroom was clean with good water pressure (hot water was readily available). Toiletries were complete but as with most hotels, expect body wash and no soap unless requested (same with lotion which you will need due to the cold dry weather). Internet was adequate but not entirely fast. The rooms had the usual flatscreen but it wasn't able to read my USB full of movies. I settled for the local channels (with very limited english channels) but since I didn't come to Japan to watch TV, I wouldn't call this an issue. Keio Plaza is right smack in the center of Shinjuku with a 5 to 10 min walk to the train station. The walk way is covered so no worries should it rain. It becomes only difficult during the winter as temperatures falls to 1° C which is a challenge to the unprepared. There are multiple places to shop and eat within the vicinity that make the hotel ideal. There is also a coin laundry 15mins away so bring a small suitcase with wheels if you're carrying a huge load. We took the airport limo service which makes its rounds around Shinjuku. Keio Plaza is its first stop so expect roughly two hours to get to Narita Airport.Overall, it was good nine days stay and I would definitely recommend Keio Plaza. Its pricey but well worth it.

They advised us to just turn off the switch! We were sweating so what they did was they brought electric fans into our rooms! Even if the staff was sincerely apologizing I am still so mad as this was not what I expected our hotel rooms to be. From all my travels this was the only time I experienced having electric fans brought into our hotel rooms ridiculous! I later learned that all the superior rooms have this kind of old air condition system and that the deluxe rooms have the new air condition system. So if you are planning to stay at this hotel be aware of this.The rooms are old outdated, the carpets are worn and dirty, I wore the slippers the entire time while in the room. I didn’t expect this since there are a lot of good reviews on this hotel. The size of the room was small, it was hard to fit 2 open luggages on the floor. The bed can fit one adult and one toddler. The toilet bathroom area was tight, very little space around the sink to put the toiletries. The ceiling was very low. There is a tub with detachable shower handle, water flow/pressure and temperature are good. The toilet is the typical Japanese one with different button functions. They included a mobile phone with internet that you can bring out, use google map and surf, I find the surfing part difficult as the phone was pre-programmed with their partnered merchants. Any calls made will have a separate charge, and you cannot use this mobile phone as a personal hotspot as they have blocked this feature. I ended up just leaving the phone in the hotel since it wasn’t user friendly and the phone kept heating up. I can’t help but compare this to the Marco Polo hotels in Hong Kong, where they give you a mobile phone and you can hotspot, call and text overseas free of charge.During check-out after paying, our luggages were still nowhere to be found. Our ride going to the airport was already waiting for us. We waited a long time and finally saw our luggages being pushed by 2 ladies who were taking their time walking and chitchatting, there was not any sense of urgency which should not be the case since the lobby was full of people waiting for their luggages and hurrying to leave.The ONLY positive about this hotel is the location. It is near Lawson, Lawson Natural, Yodobashi, Labi, a 24-hr sushi resto, and many restaurants. A 7 to 10 minute walk to McDonalds, KFC, Bic Camera and a further walk around 5-7 minutes more to reach Shinjuku West Station and Newoman mall, Takashimaya, Tokyu Hands.Overall, we are hugely disappointed with this hotel. We would definitely be looking for a different hotel when we go back to Tokyo. Would not recommend this hotel.",Asia,"pashpav</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Asia</strong>",18,2.0

There is 2 wings - Main and South. We booked the south superior twin room reading somewhere this wing has been renovated but the room while spacious (30msq) is quite outdated. The bathroom is also very old school, bath tub shower which I’m not a fan of. The 3 days we were in Tokyo (being the last leg of our Niseko ski trip), we had great sunny weather and woke up with full view of Mt. Fuji. We were on 25th floor. This hotel is on the west side of Shinjuku while not as crowded but still conveniently located, 2 mins to Shinjuku Station. There’s many eating places and convenience, drugstore around without going on the other side. The great plus for this hotel is there is a Airport Limousine Bus that comes direct to the hotel from either Haneda or Narita and vice versa. It’s the most expensive way to get to Narita but this beats lugging big luggages to Shinjuku Station. Overall, this was quite an expensive hotel which doesn’t match the value (maybe b’cos it’s peak period).

I booked 4 rooms for 4 nights through Agoda very early in July. Somehow, I realised that I had put the incorrect number of guests (1 guest per room) during my bookings. When I contacted Agoda to update the number of guests to 2 guests per room, I was told that the Hotel charges based on number of pax staying in a room, not by room basis. So I was asked to make additional payment upon arriving on the hotel. After Agoda confirmed my booking and sent me a revised booking voucher, I also contacted the Hotel about the change to ensure that all rooms will be in order for our arrival because I know it is going to be the busiest period of the year. There were also issue when I booked for the Disneyland Shuttle Bus. Long story short, there were many email correspondences between myself and the hotel staff because they kept saying they could not confirm my bookings even though I had long revised my bookings with Agoda. Everything was however sorted just before my arrival but from the incident, it can be seen that the hotel is very prideful. They do not admit that they overlooked my bookings in any reply from them to me.We arrived early around 9am at the hotel but they did not allow check in. They were happy to keep our bags but check in had to be done at 2pm. When we went back to the hotel at around 3pm, there were long Q for check in. It took us almost an hour from getting into the line to arriving into our room. However, they have a system where a bellboy will take you straight to your room together with your luggageRight after your check in is completed. This is good because I did not have to wait for my luggage after I arrived in my room. The rooms were quite spacious by Japanese standard and they were clean and tidy. The hotel is located in a strategic location.As we need to leave very early the morning of check out to the airport, i did my check out the night before. There were not many people in line but I had to wait for 20 mins before my turn. And when I asked if I can book for a bellboy to my room the next morning with our luggage at 5.45am, the gentleman serving me said he will check and get back to me. He never did. I have to call for the bellboy in the morning and when we told them our room numbers, they said they have the details already. I was surprised because the gentleman had arranged the bellboy but never bothered to inform and update me.Overall, it is a strategically located hotel.

The hotel is conveniently located to the Main Shinjuku train station but we found a nearer 3 mins walk train station Tochomae.I've seen alot of mixed reviews on the attitude of front desk staffs but my taking was definitely on the good part. When we alighted from the airport limousine bus, we were greeted by the bellboy who was smiling and assisting us with our huge luggages. After tagging our bags, he explained that check in is usually after 3pm and then led us to the premier check in area as we had booked a hello kitty room for our 3 nights stay.The female front desk staff went on with the check-in routine and inform us that the rooms werent ready (as it was only 11am) and asked if we could go for lunch and a short walk and be back by 2pm.After lunch & some window shopping at Keio Departmental Store, we arrived back at the check-in counter slightly before 2pm as my son had slept halfway thru the shopping. The same female staff saw us and gestured us to take a seat at the sofa area while she assigned someone to bring us up to the room.Coincidentally, it was that same bellboy, who had helped us earlier, led us to the rooms. Along the way, he had explained to us in the best english he could mustered about the bakery & convenient store directions located within the hotel. When we reach the Hello Kitty Room, my wife was in awe and had quickly forgotten about our son whom i was still carrying. The bellboy also suggested that he'll help to take a photo of our family with the kitty background.Needless to say, our 3 nights stay at the hotel was very taken care of. From room service to small in-room requests to check out, every part was well communicated. Check out was super fast & no question asked~!I would have rate it 5 stars if not for the fact that they are not flexible in adding the breakfast option for the kitty room as they said that my booking was done thru booking.com and not through them directly.Anyways, still a very good job done and we had already booked for a return visit in April 2018.

It is like 10 to 15 mins away from the crowded Shinjuku and Takashimaya Times Square, Odakyu and Keio department store and it is only 3 to 4 mins away from a small station called Tochomae. There are lots of places that you can go from Tochomae station,without having to squeeze n get lost in Shinjuku central station. If you do your research you should know that Shinjuku station is the most crowded station in Tokyo, so really staying in Keio Plaza is like you are having the best of Shinjuku minus all the difficulties in navigating your way. Moreover on your way to Shinjuku central area, you will find lots of shops, convenience stores and small restaurants. Besides the location, I do think that they provide a great service, room is always clean, concierge was very helpful with our luggage though she is a female, and lastly i really love the free Disney shuttle service. You dont have to find your way through trains and stations if you want to visit Disneyland or Disneysea. Moreover some tour operator that operated mount fuji day trip also depart from their hotel and airport limousine also stop at their doorstep. So it is really convenient if you are a first timer to Tokyo.Room that we booked were actually quite big to fit 3 of us plus our 3 big luggages and there is still place for a dressing table. If there could be a downside of this hotel, is their checked in time. We had gone through a long haul night flight from the 0 coordinate and of course we cant really sleep on the airplane, yet we had to wait till 2pm in order to be checked in.

Over the last 7 to 8 years, averagely, I travel to Tokyo about 3 times yearly and stayed at Keio due to its location. Sad to experience deteriorating service on each return visit, the last straw was just aweek ago and I decided not to return to Keio on my next trip in Mar. I had enough of their snobbish service. I had 2 reservations inclusive breakfast booked for the week, of which one was a returned visit. I reminded the reception staff toassign non smoking room for my return visit and to Ensure my request is spelt in my guest history for record. When I returned to check in for the second stay within the week during late evening, I was not given a non smoking room. Reason given by the male staff was no request being made and non smoking room is subject to availability. His Attitude was bad and he was very arrogant, unlike the Japanese culture, there were no apologies from him. I asked for the GM 's email but was told, he cannot divulge and claimed all matters will be channeled to the customer service officer. I then request to have a return call the following morning from the GM or the CSO to voice my frustration. I receive no call during my stay. For the interest of sustaining business in the Long run , the GM ought to take a serious view on all adverse reviews and make improvement on areas which are lacking, particularly the reception before it is too late as the staff are taking things in their own hands and sweeping rubbish below the carpet.

It has around 47 floors and two towers. Location is in the Shinjuku area amongst all the highrise buildings - the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Offices is directly across the road from one of the entrances. The hotel seems to be always busy everywhere - as it has lots of things ""happening"" from several different restaurants, to free shuttle service (several times a day) to and from Disneyland. They will also arrange transport back to the airport, even if you have a pre-paid booking. The lobby area is massive and with the number of people staying at the hotel, you never feel hemmed in.The room itself is not that big, apparently quite typical of Tokyo. It has everything you need. The bed was a little on the hard side, however reasonably comfortable. The bathroom is very small & the toilet is located in front of the bathroom door so not very well designed. Everything is very clean here and there were good quality toiletries in the room. I bought a Japanese SIM card for use there, however a free Sharp mobile phone is provided in every room that you can use while staying there. It includes free international calls & google maps etc. and you can use it like your own. So the SIM card I bought before arriving here, was a waste of money, as the hotel phone was excellent. All history on the phone while there, will be automatically erased on check out day.Several restaurants here although very pricey - would not expect anything else from a classy hotel. Breakfast is provided in two restaurants (all you can eat buffet style) however I did not eat breakfast there as it was very expensive to eat there every day. I ate breakfast at a restaurant directly across the road and costs a fifth of what the hotel charges (menu items). Whenever I went past the breakfast restaurants there were always huge lines of people waiting to get in, so they were obviously very busy.There are also very wide light & airy underground tunnels just outside the side entrance of the hotel which leads directly into Shinjuku station - very handy. They even include a travelator in each tunnel.One reason I chose this hotel was that tour companies pick you up directly from the hotel. There are only a few hotels that have this happen. Other hotel guests need to find their way to specific locations for pickup.Wi-Fi was excellent - good coverage, and never had an issue with it at all even though I was on one of the upper floors.","Maroochydore, Australia","Jenny S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maroochydore, Australia</strong>",126,5.0

There are bus's regularly operating from the airport to the hotel - cheap option. There is also a train service - going directly to the Tokyo main station - but if you caught this, you would then need to then catch a subway to Shinjuku station - which could be a hassle during peak periods - this is a cheaper option again. We caught a cab - which was around $250 AUD - not the best choose we have ever made - I would suggest the bus.The hotel itself is slightly impersonal - very large with 2 wings (Premier & South wing). Our accommodation was on the South wing.The room was spacious & well appointed. We had access to the club lounge on the top floor - which gave free drinks from 5pm to 7pm - always a nice way to start the evening! They did not provide breakfast with this service though? I have stayed in club rooms with many hotels - most have a continental breakfast available in the club lounge in the mornings - this was a slight disappointment. The hotel (in the Luxe rooms??) provide a free phone - which was a great advantage. We could take this phone out with us & we would always have internet access, maps & phone if required - this was an excellent touch.The location is what makes this hotel - close to the main subway (the system itself is easy to navigate & easy to use).The hotel is also close to the main districts of Shinjuku. Heaps of restaurants, bars & shopping is a short walk away. Please note, some of these bars & restaurants will not serve you unless you can speak some Japanese - I dont think this is meant to be offensive, but more that they will struggle communicating. Look or ask for English menus to get an idea of which restaurants are suitable.Be prepared for some serious hustle & bussel! Tokyo is extremely busy - it seems 24hrs per day! People everywhere - always! We caught a bullet train (Shinkansen) from Tokyo to Kyoto after our stay. So this was also convenient - we caught a train to Shinagawa station (all bullet trains stop here to / from Tokyo). You can then board a bullet train from there. This was certainly easier than going back into Tokyo main station & boarding there.

The second reason is that the hotel was within walking distance to both a Subway Station (Tochomae) and a Japan Railway Station (Shinjuku Station).I booked two rooms here for 4 adults. 1 was for 7 nights the other for 6 nights as I arrived into Tokyo one day ahead of my family. The first was a room with two twin beds and the second was with one almost queen sized bed. Both rooms were pretty basic, clean and adequate for our needs. The mattress on my bed was on the firm side, I am not sure if they have any other types, I slept good every night. There was enough space for two adults in each room to be comfortable. The bathroom was also basic, shower with an extra deep tub, more so than any other hotel's standard bathtub that I have been to in the US, so if you like a good soak, you can do it here. They also have the toilet with the spray/bidet function on it. The hotel is in the middle of the city, so all views would be a city view and other tall buildings. Our rooms were facing the Metropolitan Government building which is across the street from the front side of the hotel.The room rate was comparable to any similar hotel with similar surroundings. I found it well worth it for the convenient location and the service we received. The hotel has great restaurants and excellent room service. Most of the restaurants were Japanese food, but they did have a Western style breakfast buffet, a Korean restaurant and a French/Italian restaurant. Also a nice bar/lounge. They do have some shops in the lobby and lower lobby including a convenience store and a bakery type shop. If you do not wish to eat in the hotel there are many restaurants within walking distance including a McDonalds and KFC. There is also a grocery store accessible through the Shinjuku Station.The staff at this hotel were outstanding. Very professional and friendly service. Most of the people we interacted with spoke and understood enough English to help us with our needs. I would definitely stay here again if I were to visit Tokyo and I would recommend this hotel to any one who would like to stay in the Shinjuku area.",Hawaii,"Ha_Y_an_Traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawaii</strong>",66,5.0

The hotel provided everything we needed, from a mobile phone we could take out with us for the day, to a convenience store which sold late-evening snacks. The breakfast buffet was extremely adequate, with Western and Asian choices, and Mozart's music playing in the background. Twice we were seated at a table overlooking the garden next to the street, which was very pleasant. There is a long, covered walkway between the hotel and Shinjuku Station, with a travellator if you happen to be going in the right direction. We used the walkway a couple of times, but the really convenient station is Tochomae, an entrance to which is right under the hotel.

I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Rooms: The triple room actually has three beds unlike most of the other hotels which had twin beds and a roll out bed. The room was spacious by Tokyo standards. The shower had excellent water pressure which made it hard to get out of the shower every day. The water heated up quickly too. All the usual toiletries were provided including shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, hand wash soap, shower cap, cotton swabs, toothbrush etc. but they went the extra step and also provided things like hair ties (our whole group of ladies forget to bring any so we appreciated it), razor with shower cream and after shave, and even a room/linen freshener spray. There are pajama/robes and slippers too. The lighting was well thought out including a dim lamp that can be used as a nightlight. There are outlets at the bedside. Location: The closest station is Shinjuku which will take you to all over Tokyo and also the airport via the Narita Express. If you have tons of luggage, the walk from Shinjuku Station will feel endless but with your hands free it's an easy walk. Along the way there is a small convenience store for buying snacks and water. There is also a small convenience store on the 2nd floor of the hotel, which we didn't discover until the last night. About a 3 minute walk will take you to an area with tons of restaurants and 5 minutes will get you to a big mall. Service: Check-in both times was so smooth. There is never a line because as soon as you step up, there is a worker who will discreetly call someone on a walkie-talkie to come out to the desk to help you. They take your credit card info at check-in and charge you when you check out. The bell boys are really sweet and will explain everything to you in the room. Their English is so good, even better than the front desk crew. I was really impressed during our second check-in when my friend pulled out our baggage ticket and out of nowhere someone came running over to take it and go retrieve our luggage. The bell captain desk staff helped us google some things and gave cab drivers explicit instructions for where we wanted to go. Lastly, Sunrise Tours (booked through Japanican) has an office inside the hotel and pickup is inside Keio hotel, which saves an hour of having to be picked up from other hotels. There is also a complimentary Disney shuttle which is very convenient. It does fill up so reserve in advance. On the way back we wanted to come back on an earlier shuttle than what we had reserved. We just lined up at that shuttle time and since there was space, they let us board. My friend used the laundry service which was very expensive but punctual. We had a package delivered while we were away in Kyoto and the front desk held it for us until we came back. Last but not least, they provide you with a smartphone to use during the stay, which was incredibly helpful. We used it to navigate wherever we went and you can call to US for free. You can definitely find a cheaper hotel in Tokyo but I would absolutely stay here again. I loved our room, which felt like home and the location is so convenient. Plus the added bonuses of the Disney shuttle, tour location pick up, and the free smartphone made it worth the stay.

We stayed here about 7 years ago and have ventured into other Tokyo locations since then. But our revisit to Keio Plaza has pleasantly surprised us. 1st of all, the staff are professional, pleasant and friendly especially, the trainees who manned their front desk and concierge area. They are helpful and vibrant and full of energy . The senior duty managers are not as friendly as they should have (unfortunately). May be? they are 'managers' and they failed to point us to the appropriate restaurant. But all in all, their service is first class . 2nd of all, the location is perfectly and conveniently located. Less than 10 mins walk to the Shinjuku station (west gate) and there are tons of restaurants and shops along the road leading to the hotel. This is crucial for family with young children and family ( seniors) as it feels safe and has abundance to do along the short walk. Last but not least, they have more than 6 restaurants inside the hotel, their room service is also excellent and their convenience shop is just GREAT and opening hours is from 5 am to 2am ( can you actually believe that?) they have set a gold standard for 'hotel convenience shop'! The room size is great and one has sufficient spaces for many many pieces of Luggages! And the airport limousine service is perfect! Punctual and great service!I would recommend Keio Plaza to all visitors with family esp if one is looking for convenience, family friendliness and security. They may not be modernity designed and can have a more retro feel (70s design) but just love their marbles layered floors! Please enjoy he stay! It won't disappoint you!

I can excuse this as a one off, however everyone in our group experienced similar hassles. Once we got to the room the wifi didn't work, with the server being too busy.

The selection of food was great, however not all of the hot food was great (especially the scrambled eggs). The other disappointment was the exorbitant fee to use the pool, and the drink prices at the sky lounge - ¥1350 for a small tap beer is ridiculous.I don't usually whinge about hotels however this place really disappointed us and was not as enjoyable as other five star hotels.

We were warmly greeted and hosted by Teamaster Yano - she made the experience so educational, absorbing and serene. We opted for the traditional Japanese tea ceremony which took place in the tatami room. She presented each of us with wagashi then prepared thin-style matcha tea. We learned to appreciate the room's alcove, tatami mats, the tea bowls and so much else.

The room was a decent size and clean.However, the overall levels of service left a lot to be desired. The English level of some of staff was variable (one enquiry on how to get to the National Museum was met with a look of puzzled bewilderment as if we had just asked about day trips to Pyongyang) and we had all sorts of trouble just sorting out an executive membership card and membership points. Although the staff are polite and bowed a lot, we found often they would say the first thing that occurred to them when dealing with an issue. This meant we had to make 4 separate visits to reception to get our membership card and then we had a further problem of getting the proper amount of points credited. This involved a further visit and emails that continued after we left. This is not the sort of service you expect from a 5 star hotel. In the course of this, we also learnt that if you spend enough to go to a higher membership level (as we comfortably did) then this will not be effective for 2 months and so you get no benefit from spending more money. Quite extraordinary.We guess that the main aim of this hotel is not to cater for individual travellers but large convention style groups (there were two such groups during our stay) with a corresponding emphasis on quantity not quality.There is a convenience store in the hotel but this (in our view) was overpriced. Less than 100 ms from the hotel is a Lawson convenience store (near to an area full of restaurants and next to the post office).

I learnt afterwards that the hotel has a teacher student convention of about 800 people, and part of the lifts was under maintenance. It's really bad to host something so big but yet be so unprepared for it. The wifi also drops alot - not good for business users. Had the option of 3 restaurants for breakfast so thank goodness while all the tourist crowd rushed for the 2 other international/american buffet , I had pleasant breakfast at the Japanese restaurant. I wished they offered different sides to their set breakfast though cos I had it for 3 days in a row. Nevertheless the quality was good at the breakfast. They could have serving staff that smiled more to make it a better experience. The Aurora(not sure if that's the name) lounge on the 54th floor was not bad, limited food choices for snacks with drinks. Good to have a convenience store to buy drinks / snacks on level 2.

First of all, the service of this hotel was outstanding. The first day we arrived, we wanted to eat at a shabu shabu restaurant that was not too far away, so I went down to the concierge to get some assistance. The gentleman who was at the desk started searching on his computer, came up with one and discovered that it was booked. He didn't give up though, he decided to call and ask. Guess what? They had a reservation that was perfect for us. He went above and beyond for us, which we greatly appreciated. It was raining one morning and we had no umbrellas. I asked the bell guy if he had any and he just coughed 3 over without asking any questions - just like that! The rooms were clean, nice and had a wonderful view. The only gripe I had with the room was that our room had 3 beds which was great, but they were either double or queens and that crowded the room a bit. Not a huge issue. I did love the vanity in the closet area. It allowed me to put on make up while my daughters got ready in the bathroom. One more issue I had with this hotel, which is quite big since I've traveled to a few places in the world and never had this arise, but in order to use their pool, you had to pay about $20.00 US. I really think they should change this policy. It's quite absurd. Needless to say, we didn't use their pool, although we really wanted to, but I couldn't justify paying $60.00 to use a pool.

We have one of the four bedded rooms in the main tower, which is great for space (for Tokyo), with a living space with a sofa and two arm chairs located in between the four beds. The suite also has two bathrooms. Great for a family of four (it could readily accommodate 5 or six if you have smaller kids who share beds but they don't allow it).On the negative side the beds are hard as rock.There are two different buffets for breakfast, one of which they call a ""grand buffet"". The grand buffet has a wider range of food, including a lot of Japanese food. It is much higher quality than the one with just western food. Price runs 30-35 dollars per adult, 15-20 per child, the grand buffet being the more expensive one respectively (but still being the greater value based on quality of what's included). Some room packages include breakfast I assume it's the standard buffet. There is also an a la carte Japanese breakfast available (which we did not try)The swimming pool is a bit of a joke. It's located in a lovely location outdoors on a seventh floor rooftop, but they have the audacity to charge hotel guests for entry (20$ per adult free for a child) and the pool is not even heated so on an overcast day it is freezing cold. The fee is hidden away in the terms and conditions click through in the pool description on their web site and is not mentioned at all on third party sellers of the hotel.Also a word of warning, they take the whole Japanese disdain for tattoos thing uber seriously at the pool. We were the only ones there on a grey overcast day. Our 8 year old daughter had a temporary tattoo of a T on her arm (ironically from a swim club tryout), and we were asked to leave because of it. Quite funny, would have been annoyed by it if we hadn't been able to use it to parlay a return of the pool fee.Location is convenient in terms of having a covered walkway access from Shinjuku JR station. No restaurants on the streets right around the hotel, but several if you walk 10-15 minutes. Hotel restaurants for dinner are overpriced but good.Not sure if we lucked out, but our room was extremely quiet, so it was great for sleeping.All in all a decent choice for a family stay, but not as good as hoped for due to the pool issues and lack of reasonably priced dining on site.","Toronto, Canada","grahamz620</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",11,3.0

However, there are lots of restaurants with reasonable prices 100m from the door. The hotel is just across the road from Tokyo Metropolitan Building, with a great view (free) over the city. It is also walking distance to Shinjuku stations with many of the JR lines (including Yamanote-line that will take you ""everywhere""), and the Narita express. There is also a buss shuttle to Narita from the hotel. The hotel i surrounded by other hotels and office buildings, but with the restaurant area in Shinjuku close by. If you want a comfortable place to stay, this is a good choise. It is a friendly and well mantained machine, but still a machine.","Siem Reap, Cambodia","larkollen1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Siem Reap, Cambodia</strong>",17,4.0

I can honestly say we have never been disappointed here.We had two stays here during our trip. The first being before we left for Kyoto and the second being after we returned from Kyoto. We stayed in the Plaza Superior and the Plaza Deluxe rooms in the Main Tower. Both rooms were spacious, neat and clean. The Deluxe room being slightly larger than the Superior. There were a good selection of toiletries in the bathroom. We never once used our own shampoo, conditioner or body soap as theirs was just as good.The hotel itself is huge but not overwhelming. This hotel has plenty of restaurants to eat at if you so desire. We had breakfast at the Glass Court Buffet everyday during our first stay here. I have to say that I was and still am disappointed in this buffet. First off, it's expensive. Secondly, while they had many choices for a Japanese style breakfast, their choices for their American breakfasts were lacking. The bacon was half cooked and flabby. The made to order omelettes will be served runny on the inside unless you tell the cook otherwise and even then it was still slightly runny. The ham was really canadian bacon and the sausages were more like vienna sausages or cocktail franks. The saving grace for me was the toast and the small salad bar. During our second stay at the hotel, we had breakfast off site at Royal Host.The staff working at the hotel was just as professional and courteous as always. Over the years, we have gotten to know one staff member that used to work in reservations but now works in guest services. She is the nicest woman you'd ever want to meet. Thanks to her, our stays at the Keio have always been pleasant.Overall, I think the Keio is a great hotel. It's about a 6 - 7 minute walk to the Keio department store and Shinjuku station.

Absolutely different from the photos on the hotel website. Beds were really hard and the air con was pretty weak.HOWEVER, the worst thing comes now. Our friend recommended us to try the Teppanyaki restaurant in the Hotel and therefore, we decided to email the hotel to make a book and to request for one and only table that has the prettiest view on a mini garden. The other reason of wanting this particular table is that it will have just fit all our guests of the meal, and thus, a greater sense of privacy. We made this booking 3 months before our visit day and we even attached a clear photo of the table we want in the email. Here comes the ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT. On that day, we went to the restaurant with our guests with a high expectation of the dinner. Yet, at the reception, the manager was already quite impolite to search for our booking. Later, he then led us to the table. WHATTTTTT. He brought us to the super end corner of a long table, full of other customers, with no garden view. We kindly explain our request (as mentioned in the email) to the manager and the manager showed an annoyed face while left us without saying anything. We then waited in our seat for around 10 mins without any reply. And we were quite pissed by then since this is NOT the service that we were expecting from a high end restaurant. We called out for the manager and he did not even put any effort to solve the problem. He said, ""Nope, we do not have a record of your request"". Be aware, still no apologises at this moment. I then told him to check the hotel's email account and he said he had a look at my email already and he said the hotel did not promise me anything and most importantly, I did not attach the photo of the table i want. HOLYYYYY !!!! I did not want to talk to this manager and requested for someone at a higher position than him. After a long wait, his supervisor came and I showed him the email on my phone. And they could not lie anymore, and they went out to sort things out.They came back and I was about to move to that table. However, they said that they had already given the table to another group of people and asked us to stay in our place for the dinner. We were shocked by their service and without the table we want, without the view, and most importantly, having been treated with such poor quality of service, we chose to leave the restaurant.

The hotel offers fair service, comfort and amenities.

You will definitely receive what you have requested and paid the predetermined fair price for e.g. bedding arrangements for 3 in a room for 2, in line with the excellent standard of delivering expected in Japan.

That being said, we had a problem as our reservation for two adjoining deluxe rooms for three nights was incorrectly logged as regular rooms. After 45 minutes, the issue was not resolved and we had an appointment to keep. They held on to our luggage and proceeded to try and resolve the problem. When we returned, they acknowledged the mistake was theirs and that they could only give us regular rooms the first night, but would switch our luggage for the second two nights. Not ideal. The regular rooms were average size mass-market rooms. Not a lot of room and we could only open our luggage by putting it in the space between the rooms, but the beds were comfortable. The next day, as promised, they moved our luggage into the bigger luxe rooms. These rooms were a bit bigger and less tired than the original rooms, but the bathrooms retained a certain cheap quality that I did not find in other large hotels. We could also hear our neighbor's small children. The hotel provided us with a lovely box of pastries as an apology, but more importantly, when we went to exchange our keys we realized that every single person at the front desk was aware of what had happened and apologized to us.

Everything within easy reach be it restaurants, shops and train stations.Food and Beverage at Jurin All Day Dining Room - High quality food and presentation. Service good and friendly.Can take airport limousine (airport bus) direct to Narita/Haneda. Stops right at the hotel driveway. No hassle, but allow a good two hour to reach airport because it is the first hotel stop followed by a few other hotel pick-ups before heading onto the highway for airport.Room spacious and comfortable coz price-wise it is on the high side. Can use their lounge on the top floor free of charge for some small bites and soft drinks, coffee/tea. View magnificent.Cons:Very robotic staff at Front Desk i.e. Reception, Concierge, Bell and Guest Relations Male staff standing at reception area.Check in very slow despite all details filled in at time of reservation online. Had to rewrite same details again manually on check-in form!!!Staff at Reception unfriendly and no empathy. Rather cold and unwelcoming! Same for the whole team under Front Office, i.e. Concierge, Bell and Guest Relations.Perhaps they are too proud of themselves knowing that the location of the hotel is very convenient and has many facilities.One of the four lifts in the South Wing was under renovation. So, when coming down from the 33rd Floor at a peak time, it took 10 minutes!! Even with all four lifts operating, I doubt very much it is adequate for the number of rooms served. However, I understand this is a design fault which cannot be improved.This was the most expensive hotel out of all the hotels we stayed from Nagoya, to Toyama, to Tateyama, to Matsumoto. However, the service at the Keio Plaza's Front Office was the poorest!! We knew we had to pay for a good location hotel in Tokyo, but never knew that the service at Front Office could be so disappointing. The Bell staff was quick to show you to your room with your luggage, but never offered to help with putting them onto the luggage rack in the room and never explained anything about the room amenities. Quick to take the tip though. Very ""unJapanese"" for a change!!Apparently, was told by a friend she had experienced the same when she booked directly with the hotel. However, when she booked a second time (due to the convenient location) through a travel agency, it was like heaven and hell as compared with the first visit. She even got an upgrade to a better room for the price paid!!","Hong Kong, China","HellofmHK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",15,3.0

We were concerned with the ""super busy"" Tokyo environment. We found the hotel is in a beautiful district (Shinjuku,) where parks and other green space areas are within a short walking distance. Across the street is the Government Building, which is valued as an example of innovative architecture in the city. Under the building is a train station (subway, bullet and local), and at the top level of both towers is an observation level complete with a lovely restaurant, with some local specialty food shops. There is no charge. The hotel is perfectly located but it is large and very busy. When you first arrive, it can be intimidating. However, the service we received was personal, pleasant and excellent. There are other hotels which are smaller in the same area, but we were pleased with our choice.The room is well laid out, with quality amenities, great mattress and bedding. The lighting is excellent - for example, if you are going to the bathroom at night, as you walk to the bathroom, a soft night light comes on. The bathrooms contain the amazing Toto Japanese toilets which can spoil you for anything else. The restaurants were expensive but very nice. Breakfast was included in our cost. They have several breakfast venues - 1 for American style, 1 for Japanese and American style and 1 Japanese style. The food again is very good, the settings are lovely and the service is really good.Our time in Japan was marked by the lovely way we were welcomed and treated by fellow travers, guides, hotel staff, transportation officials etc. While we are considered older travelers, it was obvious that the hotel provided so much for children. For example, they were celebrating Beatrix Potters books and had displays of bunnies, garden patches and Easter eggs throughout the public areas. We were given access to the Club Lounge which served light tea and cocktail food and beverages. It also served as a quiet place to recoup after a busy day in the city.

The room we had was in the south tower higher floor facing the Tokyo Metropolitan Building and on clear days we would wake up with a view of Fuji-san! The breakfast was not great, but not bad either. We ate in the Japanese restaurant on level 1 and that was quite good. The convenience store and travel desks are also very handy. Overall if you are planning a stay in Shinjuku Keio Plaza should be given a serious consideration.",,shubhomoy b,1,5.0

There was nothing terrible about this hotel, in fact it excelled in cleanliness, customer service, and location. All very important factors. But it does have some negatives. First, it does feel like a bit of an 80's artifact. This is not terrible, but the place looks like it needs a facelift - some style. It does not feel sleek, or current in anyway. But perhaps the most confounding thing is the lobby. While more and more hotels worldwide are concentrating on making the lobby the centerpiece of the hotel, this one is oddly dull - like a greyhound station without anywhere to sit. Of course there are some really old catering style chairs put inexplicably along the wall behind check-in, but other than that there is not one stick of cozy furniture in the lobby. You could not come down here to work on a laptop or order a glass of wine or people watch. I tried to relax at the lobby bar but it is a smoker's paradise and you need an oxygen tank to sit there longer than 5 minutes. I ended up walking over to the Hilton to work from my laptop...Again, it is a great and reasonably priced hotel in other regards: the location is the best in Shinjuku and the room was cleaner than most rooms in the states...I just wish it had a sense of style. I have stayed at the Hilton down the street (which is just a bit too far from central Shinkjuku but a great hotel) and I found it to be a lot more modern and elegant.

Good things first - the location is convenient for Shinjuku station and the staff were polite. Ineffectual, but polite. Yep - I am afraid that's all of the good things covered. Now on to the bad. We stayed in a family room. Given the price (this evening is JPY75k, so approx GBP550 or nearly USD700) and the fact that its clearly not a five star hotel, I was expecting something spacious at least. Nope - four single beds lined up side by side with no other room to move. Basically the family room is a regular room which they have crammed 2 extra beds in to and doubled the price. Nowhere to relax and certainly nothing like the pictures on the website. Bathroom was functional but far from adequate, never mind luxurious. It was tiny and had a shallow bath (come on guys - this is the country of the deep bath!). Beds were creeky and uncomfortable and the room was so dusty that it triggered allergies pretty quickly. The Keio Plaza is a large hotel. That means expect to queue for everything (rather than expecting them to have provided enough of everything for a larger hotel). Lifts - 3 for 30 floors - so expect between a 5 and 15 minute wait to get in or out. Breakfast - you're looking at 30 mins to an hour. And the food quality when you get in is similar to the rooms - i.e. passable for a 3 star older run of the mill business hotel - but when you are paying as much as a Four Seasons, you will be expecting an awful lot more. Service was pretty checklist (especially at the restaurant) and when we complained we were met with a stoically stony face rather than any form of apology. Internet is slow and you are required to go through a lengthy login procedure each and every time you re-enter the room. In short, the place is fine if you know what to expect - which is what I would have expected from a 3 star hotel charging one third or less of the price. But at this price bracket, the quality of accommodations, food and service is frankly outrageous. I have stayed at many hotels in Tokyo at a much lower rate and have never encountered such issues (see reviews eg of Grand Hyatt, Palace and Andaz).

We were impressed with how quiet the room was and how we couldn't hear any street noise at all.The only complaints we had was that the hotel internet/wifi was hopeless; the queue for breakfast was often long and the pillows weren't hypoallergenic. We were definitely allergic to something in the pillows as 2 out of 3 of us were waking up in the morning with swollen & itchy faces/eyes. They might contain duck down or something similar. And we'd recommend lining up early for breakfast, especially in peak periods as the wait can be lengthy and your wait for the elevator back to your room can be even longer.

This is a massive hotel with two towers, just a few minutes from Shinjuku station. The scale will come to dominate things. Firstly the lobby is a vast desert of marble, without very much in it (not even really nice places to sit). If you want a coffee, or just to sit down and wait for someone it feels a bit unwelcoming. The restaurants are also a bit strange. Not bad (in fact the Sushi restaurant is excellent), but oddly laid out. Note that most of them are on 2F, which is actually below the Lobby floor!The biggest problem is with breakfast. When the hotel is busy you will have to wait in line. It probably won't be for more than 10 minutes, and it's very efficient, but this isn't confined to peak times.As for the rooms, they seem fine. A reasonable size by Tokyo standards.

Granted the view is great if they could move a few building blocking it. Should be called a peek-a-view room.The bathroom is small and cheaply outfitted but is well stocked with amenities like lotions, disposable razors and toothbrushes etc.I am convinced the bed is made of bricks. It is ROCK hard with thin coverings and foam pillows which make for a uncomfortable nights sleep. The tv is far from bed and you will have to strain your eyes to see it.The lobby is like a railway station 24 hours a day. If not packed with tourists it has various functions going on. The desk manager almost sent us away as we asked for a concierge and told they did not have one till we figured out desk manager is concierge.The desk manager could barely understand English and could not help us. So we took a cab to our destination instead of a train.They have a flyer in room for an indoor massage for $89US. Try booking it, person on phone doesn't speak English. Go to South tower, arrive 15 later and give me a brochure that massage is $500USD!!! No complaining because it would be lost in translation. I guess this hotel does not have many English speaking guests.The train station is situated about 15 mins walk and I am sure it would be great and easy to use if we could just read Japanese. BecauseEven the machine dispensing tickets is only in Japanese. The train station is a complete underground jungle with so many pathways it is impossible not to get lost - again unless you speak Japanese which unfortunately we don't. Dont expect a help desk or conductor to set you on right train, it is every man for himself and it is overwhelmingly busy.Booking bus to Disneyland was pretty simple, you go to bellman desk and choose from 3 or 4 times that bus leaves to Disney and a return time. The bus is run by the Disney company and encourages people to go spend their money at Disneyland. Bring lots because it will be a very expensive day.Was a fun day but expect 2 hour long waiting times every ride, massive long lines for food and even for popcorn too.There is a convenience store in basement of hotel which carries a large section of anything you may need in a fix. It is expensive but easy to access if you can figure out how to get there.We went to the Japanese / Western breakfast ONCE during our five day stay at the Keio Plaza. It is 90% dinner food and the rest is made up of stale pastries and bread. You can try convince the chef to make you an omelette in sign language because he does not understand English.Breakfast itself was extremely poor and definitely do not recommend it at 3000 yen a person.The luxe lounge is located in the south tower. A 10 minute stroll through hotel and up another elevator. The view is expansive, the food selection is not. You lucky to find pretzels, dried peas and an Asian mixed dry goods. When I came the small dessert were out but replaced quickly but not worth the trip. Do not take drinks out of the lounge - it is forbidden.Overall we did not enjoy our 5 day stay at the Keio Plaza Hotel at all. This is not a luxury hotel. I actually feel bad for the reviews who think it is a luxury hotel as they obviously do not know what a luxury hotel is. This is a high volume tourist transit hotel - a far cry from anything you'd want to return to after a long day of sightseeing.","San Diego, California","TravellingMan19866</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",78,2.0

Sushi to go and all the other goodies you can find in any convenience store. We went to our hotel room had wine, sushi and a small bag of chips in our pj's. We were happy campers.We also found the hotel staff to be very helpful. The rooms were also very nice with great views. The breakfast included could be eaten at several different restaurants.

The problem with booking direct was that they did not send an email or text confirmation which would have highlighted the problem ahead. Anyway, they would not honour the quoted rate as they have 'dynamic pricing' and the rates had moved !! No amount of haggling would move them ...not even a room upgrade or offer of a free breakfast !!! the whole process was just robotic. The rules are set down and they will not budge.We encountered further difficulties upon checkout when they would not accept the Commonwealth Bank of Australia issued pre loaded Travel Money Card.

This was rather surprising to us since the hotel members' breakfast actually cost more if non-members wanted to eat there. We didn't quite understand the policy and had requested the executive lounge front desk to ask the supervisor. But was told that supervisor would've said the same thing anyway and gave no further explanation. She and her aloof attitude was the only wrinkle in our stay though. The rest of the staff, both regular front desk and premium lounge front desk, were great. Overall, great value for anyone's trip to Tokyo who is looking for convenience to Shinjuku station, shopping and being in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku.","San Francisco, California","BTraveler808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",12,4.0

I have since also joined their EIC Membership as Prime Member (which is points based). Many accolades have been accorded to the Keio Plaza, Shinjuku and I have not been disappointed until my last stay from 28 Dec 16 to 4 Jan 17 (7 nights). I had booked online in mid-2016 and it which was an eagerly anticipated trip over the New Year. I had unwittingly booked my stay from Keio Plaza's official website but via iPrefer reservation which unknown to me, was a partner reservation system. As a result, when I checked in, I was denied my Prime Membership privileges which include breakfast vouchers, access to Member's Lounge and inability to chalk up membership points. Try as I will to explain to the Check-In Officer that I had booked directly through the hotel official website, he was adamant that nothing could be done, even after having consulted someone in the office that must be someone senior to him. I left it at that in frustration and total disbelief. I found time on my 2nd day (29th Dec) to feedback my unhappy check-in experience with the hotel. To my surprise, when I returned from my day trip to Karuizawa (shopping outlet and ski resort), an envelop had been slipped under my door with a note of apology along with with breakfast vouchers for the remaining days and access pass to the Member's Lounge. The cap in the feather was that the hotel had spontaneously changed my room rate to a preferential member's rate with a substantial difference in my favour! To me, that was a wonderful turnabout and Japanese hospitality at its best! My faith in Keio Plaza Shinjuku was completely restored.So why Keio Plaza Shinjuku? The airport limousine from Narita and Haneda brings one to its doorstep and there is a ticketing machine next to the concierge to buy your return airport limousine ticket (and do book a seat with the concierge 1st). It's a Disney Friendly hotel and provides free return bus trips from the hotel to Tokyo Disneyland and/or Disney Sea and back, but you need to make reservations with the concierge.It is conveniently located within walking distances to the major shopping centres in Shinjuku, restaurants and bars, electronic stores, entertainment and theatres and most importantly, Shinjuku Station with all the major lines that can bring you to Mt. Takao, Tsukiji Fish Market, Monja Street and almost anywhere else. If it rains, borrow an umbrella from the concierge or use the covered walkway to Shinjuku Station and the shopping centres. The hotel's restaurants and bars are also excellent.Finally, if you are hotel member, do not ever book through iPrefer!!","Geneva, Switzerland","D8327VSalberts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",6,5.0

In between we were outside of Tokyo. All 7-nights were in a Plaza Superior Twin Room (Main Tower)Pros:(1) Rooms were cleanNo complaints here, room were kept clean throughout the duration of both stays. This being Japan, cleanliness is hardly a doubt(2) Convenient LocationIt is slightly less than a 10-minutes walk from the hotel to the Central West Entrance of Shinjuku Station. Needless to say, Shinjuku station is a main transport hub in Tokyo. And that also brings you to the endless food and shopping options of the Shinjuku Area. There is also a Lawson Convenience store about a block away from the hotel, if you exit from the South Tower entrance.(3) Excellent Service from StaffNo one in particular to mention, but the staff we interacted with were all very professional and helpful. First off, we emailed the Bell Captain team to make some restaurant reservations before we arrived. That was done promptly. The check-in on both instances was prompt and the bell-boys were also there promptly to send all the luggage up to the room. Very pleasant interactions with all the staff (4) Disney Partner HotelIt is a Disney Partner Hotel, and one of the biggest advantages of that is the shuttle bus it runs to and from the Disney Resort. Horribly convenient, even more so if travelling with kids, no need to squeeze in the subway and it brings you right to the doorsteps. However bookings have to be made via the hotel website to use this service and seats are limited. Though the 2nd time we used the service during our stay, there was a bit of a hiccup, but the service recovery was excellent and more in the section below(5) Stop on Airport Limousine Bus RouteThe hotel is amongst the hotels the Airport Limousine Bus stops at. Transport in Tokyo is horribly convenient, but the Airport Limousine Bus is an added convenience, brings you straight from Haneda / Narita Airport to your hotel door steps. A bit more pricey than the train, but worth the convenience. Saves you the hassle of pulling luggage through a crowded train station. Cons:(1) Non-Japanese TV ChannelsA problem that blights many Japanese hotel, the choice of non-Japanese channels, were essentially CNN,BBC, CCTV, another Chinese Channel, a movie channel and think was FOX Asia (for dramas), could really improve of the offerings(2) Internet Log-in ProcessA rather cumbersome process. You had to first key in a password to login to the Wifi then open your browser to key in a username and password. It is a two factorial system, a bit cumbersome. But guess is a good security featureSpecial Mention:We went to both Disney Sea and Disney Land. Both time we took the free Disney Shuttle. On the 2nd trip was to Disney Land on 20/01, there was a slight slip-up, the staff at the Bell Captain Desk forgot to load the luggage of some guest. The bus had to turn back and get those bags. A bell-boy did come on to the bus and apologize and explain the situation. Noticed at that moment several guests were taking video of the apology with their smart phones. Did not think anything of it. In all we were half an hour late arriving cause of the detour. That night upon getting off the Shuttle bus, was greeted by the Bell Captain Desk Duty Manager and apologized for the delay and in the room there was a note and box of chocolate from the hotel to apologize for the slip-up. Photo attached of note and choocolates. The Duty Manager explained they had gotten complaints on the delay from some guests.Was a good recovery response to a slip-up. Kudos to the hotel. Though personally wife and I felt was a small hiccup compared to other delays experienced else where and those times the apology and response was not even half as decent.Conclusion:Definitely will come back and stay here !!!!

The airport limousine stops at the Keio too, it makes it easy even if you have heavy luggage.Opposite to the hotel is West Shinjuku, where there are many small restaurants in the alleys, you can easily find all kind of Japanese cuisines there, breakfast beef rice, noodles, hot pots, grilled, sushi etc., apart from food, there are shops just and department stores just opposite to the hotel, Keio department store, BIC and even Mapcamera also has a branch there.

Also the internet passwords (a double layer of passwords) had to be re-entered every day. Good, easy and secure internet connections are a must for travellers these days . Staff were always available to help, but the help was not always accurate or useful. For example, at the end of our stay, we asked the concierge for help to catch the subway to Haneda airport, surely not an unusual request (especially as the hotel's bus to the airport was completely booked out all morning). The instructions we were given were incorrect in that they suggested a long and complex route when a much easier one was available.

One morning we tried breakfast (not included in our booking) and had a latte which amounted to $13 AUD. Be warned.The location is about a 5-10 minute walk to Shinjuku Station and although not terribly close to all the action, well-placed with plenty of cheap restaurants and shops in a small shopping hub (??) two minutes away. We found it to be a good place to get the station for our adventures in other parts of Tokyo. A long, underground tunnel takes you to the train station so you barely need to even step outside.The huge downside for us was the internet. As foreigners, you rely quite heavily on hotel wifi to plan your daily adventure. and the wifi at Keio Plaza was the worst we’d come across in almost 20 years of travel. I would assume some rooms would have good internet, but despite complaining about this numerous times to the staff, the problem was never resolved and we weren’t offered a different room.

As you would have read, the location of this hotel is excellent. Once you have your bearings it is a quick walk to Shinjuku station and many different restaurant and bar areas. Its excellent for that. The rooms are sizable and are well maintained. Yes, as per other reviews, they may be slightly dated in some areas, and the bathroom styling is probably not going to cut it on the latest season of ""the Block"", but if you want clean and sanitary, you aint gonna get any better.Bar fridge content is frugal - so if you want to tie one on in the room, go down to the 7 eleven style convenience store on the very bottom floor near the restaurants and pick up booze at really good prices - like $3 a beer. TV is in Japanese nearly exclusively, but there is a button on the remote that you can press that changes many of the dubbed channels back to English. The name of the button is in Japanese, so a little trial and error is needed here (you also have to push it twice - handy hint!!) Whats important to note is that this really is a Japanese focused, not western focused hotel. A mate of mine booked a little earlier than I did and he got a Japanese style room - that means tatami floors and roll out futons. If that isn't your scene, make sure you let the team there know that you need a western style room. This will ensure you have a comfortable night. (mind you if you have a crook back, the futon can be amazing) Finally, the check in - check out routine is nearly totally inflexible (and frustrating). I arrived in Tokyo at 6am with two tired kids and turned up to hotel and tried to get an earlier check in than 2pm. After an hour of negotiations, I managed to get 130pm. However, EVERYONE in at 2pm, so when i got there at 115pm there was already a line of 50-60 people, so we actually checked in about 230pm.The staff were extremely polite and indeed delightful though, so the frustrations eased a little.Overall, I would recommend this place quite highly. Just remember that they have rules that dont get broken, so you have to deal with a little inflexibility.

They insisted in escorting all visitors to their room which is not necessary. However eventually I got to my room. As it was the New Years, it is a major holiday and people were very busy and there was a lot of people at the hotel. The hotel also charges a premium around this time. When I entered the room, it has been refitted probably several years ago, but still hold certain things that suggest its heritage from the 70s or 80s. In some ways, it felt the room was updated but not upgraded, leaving some finishings rather rough. However overall, it was pleasant. Service wise is generally OK but not exceptional. This may be due to the busy time of the year. They also have strange frequent flyer/miles rules that means you may not get your points. The difference that this hotel feels to other 4 or 5 star hotels is that while the room is OK, it's comparing it as a chain supermarket to a boutique store. It just feels it wants to churn as many people through as possible. I am making judgement based on comparison with other 4 and 5 star hotels I have stayed in and the price I was charged for my stay. I am happy to pay premium prices for what I feel value but this time around I simply didn't feel I had it. It wasn't bad per se but it wasn't good either, hence the rating. ",,ppywong,76,3.0

I had understood that it had been extensively refurbished and therefore I was expecting a modern, updated room, especially because I had booked a Club Room. I stayed in a Club Room in the South Tower on the 29th floor. The room certainly was dated, with marks on the walls, old highly used furniture, thin towels and a dated bathroom. However, the rooms were quite large which was a good plus.Staying in a Club Room gave us lounge access on the top floor of the South Tower. The lounge is open from 10am-5.30pm for refreshments and then up until 9.30pm for the bar. However, I wouldn't particularly recommend paying extra for the lounge. The food and drink is nothing special and the lounge became very crowded at certain times of the day. In the gym, the equipment was quite dated. In the South tower, there was a mini-mart conveniently located in the basement which was even better than any Lawson's you could go to outside. It has a wide range of pre-prepared foods (Japanese, Chinese, Western etc.) which the attendant can even microwave for you. There is also a selection of restaurants in the hotel. The location of this hotel is superb.

The rooms are dated. The breakfast buffet is average---unless you like canned fruit cocktail. The elevators in the South Tower have the craziest arrangement. There are two different call systems. Each across from the other. One elevator bank doesn't work at all. So each time you are in the lobby you need to push buttons on both sides. That's not so inconvenient when you figure this out. But the real nonsense happens when during busy times. If you are get into the elevator in the morning, be prepared to stop at every floor. Most of them empty as the riders got picked up by the elevator on the other side. Also get used to lines at this hotel. Lines to check in. Lines to check out. Lines to talk to the concierge. Lines to get into the breakfast room. Finally my pet peeve. I am a gym guy. I try to get exercise every day when I am traveling. The gym at the Keio Plaza is the absolute worst gym I have seen in a hotel of this caliber. In fact, I have seen better gyms in budget hotels in rural America.

I will most likely stay here again given the ideal location. Located not more than 10 minutes walk to Shinjuku station, the station has boasted being the busiest subway/train station in the Tokyo area (even busier than Tokyo station) can take you anywhere in Tokyo. Buying a day pass for the subway allows you unlimited rides to anywhere in the city for just 1000 yen ($10 USD).Rooms were quite larger than I expected and well appointed. Free bottle water per day, heated toilet seats, in room safe etc. Toiletries were very well stocked including toothbrush etc.For dining and food, the hotel itself have about 11 different restaurants. They western style cuisine to traditional Japanese food, to Teppanyaki, Sushi or even tempura. I personally ate at two of the restaurants.. Yamani - Teppanyaki restaurant was phenomenal ! .. and western breakfast at Jurin. A bit pricey but very convenient and the service was nothing less than excellent! If dining at the hotel isn't your thing, Near the Shinjuku station (a mere 10 min walk), there are literally hundreds of places to dine. You can even go up to a couple of large Malls near the station.. Keio Department store Mall or Odakyu Dept. Store and there are food courts (all kinds of different food you would want) to dine in. Sight seeing - If going on your own using the subway/train for site seeing isn't your thing and would like something more organized (with transportation and guide), the hotel is actually a pickup hub for one of the largest tour companies in Tokyo. The tour company (which as an office within the hotel itself) can offer your tours that pickup directly from the hotel ranging from half day tours, night tours, all-day Tokyo tours and even tours to Mt. Fuji all within the convenience of your hotel. The hotel also offers a shuttle bus to Disney if you like (check with the Bell Station for pickup and drop off times).The hotel is pricey in a US perspective but then again, Tokyo is pricey it itself. For being the first time in Tokyo, I think my wife and I choice wisely with Keio Plaza. Definitely will stay here again.Site Seeing Tip:Best View of the City for free? Instead of going to Tokyo Tower where you are charged to go up to the top, try going to the Tokyo Government building across the street from the hotel.

Upon check-in, there was a very long queue which took 20min to eventually get to the front. I had booked a non-smoking room however when we got to our room, it stank of cigarettes. I asked the bell service staff to move us to a non-smoking room as we don't smoke. She kindly offered to help us and rang reception 3 times from our room to request the change but no answer! So we were asked to wait in the room while she went downstairs to speak to reception. We started getting rather annoyed at this point as the room smelt so bad and after waiting almost 30min we eventually got a call to the room and asked to come back to reception as they had found another room for us. By this point we had headaches from the horrible smelling room! When we reached reception, I explained our situation to one of the staff and he asked us to join the back of the queue again which would have taken another 20min! Unbelievable, we were almost ready to cancel everything. He asked us twice to join the queue and only when I told him this was terrible service as we had already spent almost an hour trying to check in, he went to get his manager. The manager explained that there was no non-smoking room for us available right now and we would have to wait. However, because they had made us wait for so long already, we were running late for our dinner plans and there wasn't anywhere for me to get changed. When I explained this to them, they magically found a room and kindly upgraded us to a larger room. We were thankful and appreciative but there was no apology for making us wait for so long and we felt like the manager was cold and not sincere. Felt like everything was a battle just to check in! The staff need to communicate better between themselves to deliver more attentive service you would expect from a 5 star hotel.

Other reviewers have mentioned these factors, but they really made for a comfortable and hassle-free stay in Tokyo.1) The Narita airport bus stops right at the hotel - no walks with luggage, or additional taxi rides needed.2) Tour bus companies (Gray Line and Sunrise) pickup right at the hotel. 3) The hotel has an entire level of restaurants: two Japanese, one French-Italian, one Chinese, and one, more casual, Continental. We ate at the medium-priced Japanese and the French-Italian restaurant. We thought the food was excellent and the service, gracious. Hotel guests received a discount. The prices were equivalent to a mid-level restaurant in our own large American city. We thought they were a good value. There are more casual eateries (plus Starbucks and McDonald's) on the streets between the hotel and the Shinjuku rail station, but after days of touring we wanted relaxed sit-down dinners.4) There is a convenience store on the restaurant level which has inexpensive take-out food -sandwiches, sushi/sashimi, yogurt, beverages, and snacks.5) Shinjuku rail station is a ten minute walk away - there is a covered passageway at ground level on the north side of the hotel (which also serves commuters to the office towers in the area). The Tochomae subway station is even closer - one block from the hotel. This line gave us direct service to the Edo-Tokyo museum and one-transfer service to Ueno Park and the Tokyo Station area.6) Kabukicho, the neon-lit, nightlife and red-light district at the northeast end of Shinjuku station is a fifteen minute walk. We were interested in seeing it, but also glad to get back to the more corporate environs of the Keio Plaza. The Tokyo Government Center (with its free observatory) is a two block walk in the opposite direction. Finally, the rooms and service exceeded our expectations. The rooms were equivalent to, or larger than, standard contemporary, city hotel rooms in the US (see picture). Check-in and check-out were very fast - also unexpected in a large and busy hotel. Lobby staff spoke excellent English, with a level of politeness which we already miss here at home.","New York City, New York","IDLnyc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",11,5.0

It is also very close to the Shinjuku station so you can go shopping using the local transportation.One perk from this hotel is that the guests can ride the ""free"" shuttles to/from the Tokyo Disneyland and Disney Sea Parks, but you will need to make reservations. Prior to leaving for Tokyo, we made arrangements/reservations with the hotel for the free shuttles to and from the hotel and Tokyo Disneyland, which was so very convenient.

There were several electrical outlets although somewhat difficult to reach. We always travel with a multi outlet extension and a local adaptor for our multiple items, but I crawled under a table to plug it in. The room was nice, but nothing fancy.

All were extra. Breakfast was an ok buffet. Watch your time as they tear down and set up for lunch a little early. A little expensive, but typical for a large hotel. Also ate at the Italian and the Hibachi style restaurant. Both had reasonable options on the menu. We particularly enjoyed the hibachi restaurant. Everything cooked at the table. Excellent service and very clean. Respectful of my husband's crustacean allergy. Dinners were $175 and $135 for two with no alcohol. Ok for the hibachi but probably overpriced for the Italian. Service was very good and abundant. English speakers were available and could handle simple exchanges. Beyond that they may need someone else to help with your problem. The best buy were magnum bars in the lower level sundry shop for less than $2. We had one every day. There are money exchange machines off of the lobby that are reasonable and easy to use.

Nice without being luxury. It's a huge property so you feel safe and taken care of with all those resources around you but since it's so big it feels a little unfriendly; but the people who helped us all seemed just fine. I wouldn't call them overly friendly but they were pleasant and helpful. Best part was convenient location in Shinjuku. This isn't a hotel that makes you want to hang out for more than the time you need to rest, sleep, change, and then move along your journey.  PROPERTY- huge hotel with great location in Shinjuku- two major towers of rooms and tons of restaurants; I didn't eat at any so I cannot comment on it- they serve breakfast but it was fairly expensive so we opted out of it- lobby is on the 3rd floor- multiple doors to access hotel depending on what direction you approach fromROOM- moderate size with 2 twin beds, sitting chair and table and long desk. bathroom had a big tub, heated toilet, and sink. small bathroom counter tops. fairly large for a Tokyo hotel.- the non-smoking room smelled like smoke and even with the ionizer and air freshener, the room smelled awful and you cannot open windows- outdated design, tired carpet- basic amenities- safe and refrigerator in roomLOCATION- steps from the Tochomae subway stop and within ~10 minutes walking from Shinjuku Station. Use the underground passageways if you are walking to Shinkjuku station; it is much easier than trying to find out how to cross that huge Shinkjuku station thoroughfare- across of the Tokyo Metro Government building (our room had a great view of it), which offers free access to the 45th floor observation decks (North and South Buildings)OTHER- the Airport Limousine bus stops here to Narita and Haneda; you can make a reservation at the Bell Desk and pay on your room charge- on top of my hotels.com payment I think they charged a 600 yen hotel tax for a 3-night stay. Cash or credit card accepted- the guest services desk helped book reservations at restaurants - super helpful if you just ask!- depending on the price you pay, I think it's a fair hotel.

We also attended another hosted dinner upstairs on the high floor whereby our hosts and the other guests partook of a very traditional Japanese meal in the Japanese style sitting on cushions and feet in the cut out area below the table.

Our recent stay in Sep revealed even more flaws in their customer service. Check-in time was 1400 hr and knowing that Keio Plaza is getting more and more crowded these days, we don't expect an early check-in and was there only at 1400 hr. Our room wasn't ready and was asked to return in an hour......Our room wasn't ready after that long hour, and was asked to check in first with the room key to be followed. By 1700 hr, our room still wasn't ready, and we were told to line up in the long queue for check-in again .................Let's just say the check-in wasn't pleasant and the frontline staff wasn't apologetic at all ...... we were given only 6 breakfast coupons when we should have 8 ..... the staff obviously wasn't happy when I pointed her mistake .......3.

I called room service and asked for a few more pods and was told that I had reached my daily allowance and would need to buy additional pods. The service manager eventually came to our room to explain in more detail and brought more pods. We were not charged for the additional pods as I explained we had not used any prior. We didn't ask for any more pods again. We decided to go for a swim one day but were told that we had to pay 2000 yen each to enter the pool area. That's about A$25.00 each.

I can imagine its good old days, but right now it needs some upgrade with its hardware. Anyway, I'd consider the room as clean and neat. This was not the first time we visited Tokyo, and we were fully aware that many Japanese did not feel comfortable speaking in English. However, we were a bit disappointed (and frustrated) to find, in this 4.5stars hotel, that some staffs of the check-in counter (and even of the concierge) were not able to communicate in simple English. Location-wise, the hotel is on the west side of Shinjuku (with Shinjuku Station as reference). It took us 10mins to walk to Shinjuku station; 15-20mins to walk to the east side, where most department stores are located. We found it more convenient when we stayed in another hotel right above the Shinjuku Station during our previous visit.

The hotel excels when it comes to accessibility and location. It is a very short walk from the biggest subway station in the world, Shinjuku. And you have another metro like (Toei's Oedo line) literally steps away from the hotel. This means if you are checking in here only to sleep, all of Tokyo is very accessible. The hotel is also accessible via the Airport Limo Bus as they are an official stop. If availing of that feature, head for the bell desk. Rooms are small as expected for Japanese size but somehow comfortable. BUT (and here's the big gripe), the hotel does not pay heed to requests you make at reservation -- meaning if you wanted a double room or a non-smoking room, you may still end up with a smoking room with a single bed. If you try and ask for the room you requested at check-in, they will tell you to pay double. My other travel mates also received a note in the middle of their stay that the hotel was hiking up their room rates due to occupancy levels. Wow. You'd wonder if this hotel was operated by the Yakuza. Certainly not Japanese hospitality or ""Omotenashi"" as I didn't observe or feel whole-hearted customer service. It is ludicrous even in Western standards. Given there are many other hotels in the area that are of similar distances to the station, I will definitely stay away from Keio Plaza when I return to Tokyo.","San Francisco, California","dowotee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",9,3.0

This next day, I took a Hato bus tour, which picks up right from the lobby. Finally, an express bus to Narita also leaves from the hotel. All of this made sightseeing and travel back to the airport extremely simple and convenient. This is a big hotel, with multiple restaurants.

Hence, exiting the hotel was made easy with all the other 'larger' entrances available. In essence, the hotel was well kept, clean and the staff were all happy to go out of their way to assist. The concierge team were most helpful in so many ways and on so many days and it was such a pleasure to deal with them. Whilst we were there, one experiences was not so favourable. There was a large conference on at the time and this impacted the utilisation of the lifts. At one stage, we had to wait half an hour because all the attendees were going to dinner at the same time.

It is still three long blocks to got to shinjuku station. Or one can take tomache station and transfer at shinjuku station. Basement convenient store is excellent. Sells all sort of snacks and handy foods late into night. Their peach jello is so good my kids was asking if we can go back just for that. My room was spacious with 3 single size beds. I was very appreciative of having a bed on my own. Room was clean and renovated. The bathroom however needed a facelift.

The school has their own travel agent that they use for this trip and of course i just joined in last later additional participant which paid and coordinated by myself, not using the travel agency that the school uses. Long story short, of course we didn't know that Japan uses occupancy instead of pay for room like any hotel in USA does. Therefore I have to pay extra in order to stay in the same room with my wife which is just a small fee which i paid without complaint.But when i ask for extra breakfast voucher, i was rejected flat out by the manager and to make matter worse, he has the audicous to say your wife already have the voucher, you just an addition guest that has to pay for breakfast?? At this point, i felt that he insulted me without being direct insulting, and i felt a bit offended by the way the manager said to me.I thought Japan has great customer service because I end up staying another hotel (Sheraton Miyako) for the last 3 nights, they even took my wife and my luggage up to our room which Keio didn't do that.Keio standard room is much smaller compare to Sheraton Myiako standard room. Keio's wifi is unstable because i kept get disconnect while Sheraton wifi is strong, fast and stable.House keeping comes in the afternoon for Keio that's first for me, while Sheraton is in the morning which it should be.Sheraton only consider their hotel a 4 star rating, but they offer excellent service. Sure i didn't get breakfast voucher because they already stated when you book that they don't provide free breakfast but i didn't ask so that's on me. Keio, i asked and i get not only rejected and they insulted me on my intelligent.

Keio Plaza is ideally located in Shinjuku with great access to shops, restaurants, rail stations and the entertainment options Shinjuku is famous for, including the Golden Gai bars. The quality of the rooms are good, the staff are generally very helpful and they did a wonderful job of checking in a group of 29 of us quickly and painlessly.There were a number of other things that missed the mark.The foyer and reception area lacks any welcoming feel with very limited seating and no clear meeting point for guests. It has a very small gymnasium which is surprising for a hotel of this size and you have to pay extra to use the pool.While some of the above are possibly difficult to change, it was things that should have been done better that were the greatest concerns. Level 45 is where they have a well known bar and restaurant facilities and this was closed for renovation. Fair enough. The problem was there was no real attempt to provide good alternatives and one of the hotel staff on the first night actually directed us to level 45 for a drink.In the cocktail and tea bar off the lobby, the only real alternative it was very nicely set up but frustrating that so many of the staff were slow to attend to taking orders.A large group conference came to the hotel while we were there and this caused serious problems which should have been much better handled and communicated. For some reason it was felt necessary to have them in the South Tower which already had a lift out of service and then another one dedicated to the conference at peak times of the day. This meant we had people taking over 20 minutes just to get from their floor to the lobby as there were only 2 lifts servicing the whole tower. The main tower had many more operational and no problems and this appeared to show very poor planning and execution.

Bathroom mirror had area that didn't fog up!! View was great from our room in the south tower. As for exploring the Shinjuku station was close which made for easy travel around Tokyo. Good food and shopping were everywhere. We didn't take advantage of the amenities. Top floor bar was closed but the sake bar was nice. Staff were very friendly and polite. Which is standard in Japan.

After returning, I wanted to put my apples in the luggage to be checked in the airport later. At that moment, the senior staff, wearing suit, I presumed the bell captain. I try tell him that I wanted to put my apples inside my luggage and ask him to get my luggage. He keep saying, "" You wait outside 10 min before, we bring luggages to bus"". That is all he know. I try again and again to explain to him, he later get a bit upset and brought me all the luggages to me, keep quiet and walk back to the bell counter. There were some junior staff around there but they dare not intervene, which I presumed that is the Japanese culture. Later, another younger staff came from somewhere and saw me with the 6 pieces of luggages spoke to me in English and I explained to her. She quickly take care of my luggages and were settled from there on. If all staff are able to understand and best of all converse in English, it will earn a 5 rating from me.","Singapore, Singapore","Tom_Fong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",11,4.0

First, the airport bus from Narita topped directly in front of this hotel. Ditto for the return trip to the airport. Second, Shinjuku station was 10 minutes away on foot (if you don't get lost in the subway zone). Third, there were many cafes, restaurants and stores around the hotel. Fourth, there was a laundromat ten minutes away - they washed and folded our laundry for an evening pick up for under $19. Fifth, we prebooked the free shuttle to Disney Sea - to and fro. Sixth, as first timers to Tokyo, we felt safe and less confused as each day went by because of the central location and proximity to places from this hotel. The room was very spacious. The twin beds were large. The heated toilet seat and bidet was awesome. The tub drain needs a clean to remove a font musty smell and slow drain of water. We had a view of the city from the 24th floor room. We tried the Glass Door restaurant buffet, and it was good.

Free wifi in the room, but had to sign in every time it was used (you get an envelope with the network/password when you check in).A great service offered by the hotel is a free shuttle bus to Disneyland - make sure you book a time, as places fill fast. The lovely staff who booked our place were so helpful. They also let me borrow a power conversion plug, which was much appreciated.There is a smoking room on the ground floor where you can attempt to chat to people from all over the world!

Breakfast was offered in three rooms down the escalator, and the staff were very efficient and pleasant, even when you had to wait in a queue at busy times. The food selection was good, and the egg chef was fun to watch - fast and friendly.Walking out the back door, you can walk for 10 minutes to the left and find a lovely garden to stroll around, or if you walk to the right through a huge subway, you find the Shinjuku Station and a large shopping complex. Across the road are some good places to eat - one called Royal or Regal or something?? sorry - was excellent value for money.

The rooms were typical Japanese size and well-appointed. Nothing out to the ordinary for the price that we were paying for. Major plus point was its proximity to the bus station and its free shuttle arrangement with DisneyLand/DisneySea, making it easy for us to catch our 6am rides.

The porters helped to unload the luggages and bring into the holding area for us. 2) Keio Plaza Hotel is one of few Disney Good Neighbour Hotels which provides complimentary bus shuttle services to Tokyo Disney Resort (Land & Sea). This is also an important factor for us as we were travelling with a senior and a toddler. However, a word of advice if you wish to take the shuttle bus, you need to inform the hotel reception the moment you have decided on the date you wish to go to Disney Resort, preferably at the moment you book your hotel as they only have three timings: 7.30am, 9.30am and 12.30pm. As you have guessed, the two earlier timings are the most popular timings and they are always fully booked. The same goes for return timings. 3) Accessible to Shinjuku JR Station which is also the interchange for the various train lines like Oedo line etc. There are a few ways to walk to the station as the hotel has a few exits so be sure to check with the hotel staff before moving off. I would recommend the West exit with the taxi stand as you will get to walk past many shops such as Lawson, Yodobashi and eateries such as Subway, Starbucks, Pronto, Sushi bars etc. From the West exit, you are 10-minute leisure walk from the shopping area at Shinjuku ranging from Keio Shopping Mall (Yes, it's sister company of Keio Plaza Hotel. There is 5% discount for Keio Plaza Hotel stayers), MyLord, Lumine, Takashimaya Time Square, Tokyo Hands, Uniqlo etc. 4) Newly renovated South Tower with high floor rooms was an attraction to me when I was searching for hotels in Shinjuku. We know how small the hotel room in Tokyo can be so when we saw this, we decided to choose the Plaza Superior Rooms (20F above) to get a good view. We were not disappointed. The room is spacious and even has a space for coffee table and sofa to lounge around. The toilet is also spacious. 5) Excellent service from the staff. a) Online support: When we booked the hotel via a third party hotel booking site, we contacted the hotel to confirm our booking. They were very prompt in replying and also detected and alerted us of multiple bookings from us (We tried to book from Booking.com and another site). They also took note of our request to have two rooms side by side. b) Porter Bell Hop Service: When we reached the hotel by the Airport Limousine Bus, the porters promptly took our luggages and ushered us to the bell hop counter to issue us a stud for the deposit of our luggages without us asking so that we can go and shop until the check-in timing at 2pm.c) Reception: Even though we were not issued a room before 2pm, the staff at the reception counter issued us a temporary wifi login and password for us to assess internet for our planning. They even have maps of train stations ready to guide us to the places we want to go. I am particularly impressed by this trainee at the reception counter, Yuzaki. She served us when we asked about the one-day tour package to Mt Fuji and Hakone. She was very patient to share with us the different types of packages offered by different companies as well as helped us to book the package and explain about the type of food served for the lunch. We pushed the boundary by asking her to help us find nearby shops that sell Anello bags. Yuzaki went the extra mile by calling the company to find out about the resellers' stores nearby and she even asked if we have a certain model that we are looking for, so that she can direct us there to buy. That's what I call great personalised service! d) Room Service. On our first night, we requested for a bed guard for our bed so that our little boy will not roll off the bed when sleeping. The service staff came within a short time and installed the guard for us. The room cleaning service did an excellent job in ensuring our toiletries and amenities are always restocked and the bath tub was scrubbed clean. e) Sunrise Tour Agency is in this hotel. If you wish to book a Day Tour to Mt Fuji, you would most probably heard of Sunrise Agency which provides such day tours. Good thing is that you can book it at the reception and meet directly at your hotel lobby for pickup. f) Good restaurants and a convenience store within the hotel. The convenience store sells a variety of food and beverages and even souvenirs of Hello Kitty and Disney characters.There are a few restaurants for you to choose and dine from.Bottom line: Get a high floor hotel room. There is great service from staff.","Singapore, Singapore","Mr_ATan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",32,5.0

You would expect the service provided to be on par with the price we are paying. 1.) Some days of room service was terrible with our clothes that were left on bed crumpled and thrown at the corner of the Room. 2.) When we were booking for the bus to disney we were served by the most impatient and impolite bell captain Ito san. He even clicked his tongue few times when we asked about other timings for the bus. In the end he told us that there is no more return bus on that day and all were fully booked but surprisingly when we approached another female staff there were suddenly seats available and when we asked if some one has cancelled, her reply was no. The seats were always available. Good luck to you if your bell captain is Ito san. By the way we had also officially complained to their management on this. 3.) On the first day of checkin, my creditcard company informed me that an amount of $7000+ has been charged by Keio Plaza. This is normal as hotels usually does this. But on the last night of my stay, I was asked to make payment at 1am for the hotel before checkout on the next day. The reason given was my credit card was rejected. I showed my creditcard online statement and it clearly showed the $7000+ that was charged and I ask the person at the cashier to try my card. But without trying he keep insisting it is rejected. I had to wake my wife up at 130am to ask her to come down with her creditcard while I made calls to my bank. My bank informed me that there is nothing wrong and Keio Plaza should be able to charge my card. The cashier still do not want to try and started calling mastercard and only when mastercard confirmed there is no issue that he tried my card and of course there was no problem charging. All in all this wasted 30 to 45 mins of my time in the middle of the night. I had to wake my wife up as well and suffer the strange looks from other guests. I have previously stayed at Keio Plaza several times but this will most likely be my last. I don't mind paying more but at the very least the service provided should be on par with the amount you are charging.Fyi two queen size rooms were booked for my family of 5 (2 adults , 2 child and 1 baby)",,Chee how P,8,1.0

It was also important to be close to public transport options. The Keio Plaza Hotel fully met our expectations. A luxury express bus from Nerita airport delivered us directly to the hotel, which is only a five minute stroll to Shinjuku station (where we managed to get lost on several occasions, but that is another story). Our room was large, even by western standards, modern and very well appointed. Wifi access was good.

Nice to have that extra space in the room, especially if one has kids, as opposed to most other cramped hotel rooms in Japan. Agree with many reviewers here that the lobby is almost always very busy, and moreso the reception area. Very nice to have a convenience store in the basement that has mostly everything you need, and at regular prices as well. One of the most talked about aspects of Keio is the breakfast. If you have a breakfast coupon, you can choose from among 3 restaurants - Jurin, Glass Court and Kagari. Jurin is mainly continental with a bit of local viands and rice/miso, good selection and longer hours. Glass Court is called the ""super buffet"" since it has a huge selection even for breakfast (chicken, salmon, veggies, pancakes, waffles, congee, rice, bacon, eggs, etc etc), but the lines are always long at the entrance after 7am. Kagari offers a Japanese set menu for breakfast, and the ambience is a bit gloomy, hard to start the day that way.Location wise, the hotel is average. Getting from your room to any of the hotel entrances/exits will take a bit of time already because the hotel is big, then getting to the main Shinjuku station is another 10-15mins depending on your pace. And the Shinjuku station itself is big so after a long day of walking, all those steps add up. There's Tochomae station just 5 mins away from the hotel entrance but the lines there are much more limited than the Shinjuku station where JR and subway are all converged. Lots of food choices though just steps away from all entrances of the hotel, best bet is to explore and choose. For shoppers, the bulk of Shinjuku shopping is approximately 15 minutes away on foot, but once you get there, there are so many options to choose from.Hotel staff were generally friendly and helpful and cheerful, and that is a big plus especially knowing that they do not accept tips and do their service willingly.

I think there's more selection than Jurin. And the staff at the Glass Door is more attentive to clear your plates. The room itself is a good size, the bed comfortable. There is a Nespresso machine in our room, the water has a good pressure and easy to get hot water on the shower. Closet size is big for both of us. We got a room that has a fabulous view of the Metropolitan Government building and Mt. Fuji (if she decides to show up). All in all, we are happy with our 5D/4N stay in this hotel. Will definitely choose this hotel again when we;re back in Tokyo.","Manila, Philippines","Maridel0716</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",13,5.0

Our last hotel (Century Southern Tower hotel) was better overall, but the main advantage of staying in Keio Plaza was the location & ease of access. Easily accessible to train stations and around 5 minutes away to Shinjuku station, the hotel's location made it extremely easy to get around. Besides that, the hotel is surrounded by restaurants, convenience stores, and little shops that are always interesting to explore. A few minutes of walking will also take you to the huge Keio department store, Odakyu, the Takashimaya area, Tokyu hands, etc. ROOM: +The room itself was quite large, although we were able to stay on the luxe lounge floor. I don't know what the rooms on the other floors were like, but I think most are fairly spacious (based on feedback from others in our group). We also had a large window overlooking part of the city. +Had free wifi and basic amenities +Quiet; we couldn't hear any traffic or noise (though we were on the 34th floor)-Not very clean. The tablecloth (which they did not replace during our stay) had some stains on them, and the carpet felt dusty (which is what you would normally expect from hotels that have been around for quite a while). -Cleaning service was not very clean; they tended to leave used cups and other things even after they had been in. -Lighting a bit dark; everything tended to look quite gloomy in the room, especially at night. FOOD: +lots of variety for breakfast, lunch, and dinner within the hotel as well as areas in the vicinity -limited seating; absurdly long lines to get into the Japanese restaurant for breakfast.Since we were often in a rush we ended up eating Western breakfasts for most of our stay since there was no line getting in most days. OVERALL SERVICE: +Those at the front desk were very kind and helpful, and they had a lot of maps available that were definitely helpful. +Easy arrangements with transportation to and from the airport -Check in was too late (4 PM), and check-out too early in my opinion (11 PM)Overall, for me it was an average place to stay in; perhaps good for short business stays due to location and access to things like internet, etc. For family/leisure stays, it could be better.https://www.tripadvisor.com.ph/ShowUserReviews-g1066457-d304305-r375654815-Keio_Plaza_Hotel_Tokyo-Shinjuku_Tokyo_Tokyo_Prefecture_Kanto.html#","Manila, Philippines","rebeccac521</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",9,3.0

Obviously that person didn't stay where we are staying, which is a standard twin room. I usually do extensive research before I choose a hotel, especially now with a baby, but since my in-laws already decided that this is where they want to stay, I booked it reading only a handful reviews (all say clean, comfortable, spacious, great location or something along that line).Clean ? I found a pubic hair on a foot towel and trash underneath the bed. Enough said.Spacious ? Not if you book a ‘standard’ room.Comfortable ? Not if you are a non-smoker with an 8 month old baby and they put you in a smoking room.Location ? I guess so.After booking, I found out that this is like a buffet of a hotel – it is gigantic and has hello kitty rooms to fully renovated rooms and not so renovated rooms like the one we are staying right now (yes, I’m here right now as I type this review).Long story short, I knew we would be staying a smaller/outdated room. I knew that plenty from my research. A pubic hair on a foot towel or trash underneath the bed don’t really upset me (okay, maybe the pubic hair). I’m upset because they put me in a smoking room, knowing that I’ve asked for a crib or a bed guard for my baby. They asked if I asked for a non-smoking room. I don’t know what the procedure is but I also didn’t ask for a smoking room but what I did ask was a crib…A BABY CRIB. They say they will try to switch our room today as the hotel is 108%(?) fully occupied. Also earlier party asked to switch their room for the same baby reason so they didn’t have any more non-smoking room.

Bell capital Mikiko Inahashi is extremely helpful in helping us to send and receive commercial parcels for our business, and voluntarily track down a missing parcel for us even it has nothing to do with the hotel. He chased it and make sure it arrives before we depart to airport.

Helped us when we need it and did not take a single tips for the work he did for us. I cannot thank him enough. The world is a better place with man like him, worth recognition. For the housekeeping, excellent service, remember our requests, and kept the room tidy for us. Excellent!

On a big downside...after arranging check out the night before to save time in the morning as we were travelling from Shinjuku train station, with luggage in peak hour (interesting!!!) to Kyoto, we spent 20 minutes waiting for a lift that wasn't at full capacity! One lift was out of service and two just did not open in all that time!

The Keio Plaza does turn off their AC during the cold months and the rooms can get a little stuffy but they will provide a fan if requested. The only hotels in Tokyo that keep their AC on are the western hotels like the Hyatt, Hilton, Marriott, etc. The hotel itself is very nice, all the rooms are very clean and well maintained.

We chose to eat all our included breakfasts in the main buffet restaurant and these were the best in our whole trip with masses of choice but we could have eaten in several of the other restaurants. We ate no other meals as we found so many local restaurants nearby which were vastly cheaper, though we did have a cocktail one night in the bar. We regularly used the convenience store in the hotel which sold bento boxes etc & drinks at street prices (including wine at under £5 a bottle compared with at least £35/40 in the hotel proper). Our room was a good size, well equipped and spotless. Our only problem was that we couldn't use the internet even though we seemed to be connected but we found internet very hit & miss across the whole country. TIP - to escape the crowds and general mania of central Tokyo, we took the JR Yamanote line from Shinjuku station to Hamanatsucho and from there walked half a mile or so to Hinode pier where we caught the regular ferry under the Rainbow bridge to Obaida Seaside Park - a haven of peace away from the crowds and with an amusing miniature Statue of Liberty.

There is ample room for 4 small twin beds, a small 3 seat sofa, and 2 armchairs, as well as the benefits of having 2 bathrooms.

Free wi-fi for as many devices as you want, where you had to relog in every day was a bit painful but ok.The let down is in the service, not from the want of trying to serve, but from the dated processes in place. They start check in at 2pm, and not a minute before. Given that check in takes 20 minutes, and despite 10 plus receptionists, a long queue develops. Wrtitten forms are still being filled out, breakfast coupons manually collated, and the recptionist are still doing paperwork 5 minutes after a guest departs with their key. Looking at their check in software, looks like something circa 1985, with computer screens to match. They need to invest here, and set themselves up with the latest electronic point of sales hard/software. This inefficiency then transfers itself, to all the other service areas. Long queues at bell desk, duty manager, concierge. Though there are many restaurants, and a 10% discount for guests the dinner deals, JPY10k plus for teppanyaki, tempura, sushi etc don't come cheap. The lunch deals JPY3-6k are far more reasonable, though quality is good, its nothiing so extraordinary to make you want to pay double for dinner.This hotel with the right management could be so much more, but is stuck in a bit of a time warp.","Hong Kong, China","hit16</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",122,3.0

JR Shinjuku station is a 10 minute walk, and there is also a subway station right next to the hotel entrance. Shinjuku mall, department stores are all with reachable distance. It is an extremely busy hotel, its lobby perennially congregated with large number of tour groups. So if you are after more discrete stay, the hotel probably is not a good candidate. I stayed in a two different type of rooms, the renovated plaza luxe room in the south tower and the standard room in the main tower. They are distinctively different in size and condition as you can see from the attached photos. The plaza luxe one also entitle guests to access to the club floor, servers tea and coffer during the date and happy hours in the evening, but do not expect a full happy hour experience. The drinks served in the evening are very minimal and food items are nearly non-existent. I noticed that a bottle of locally produced whisky was consumed by guests in the first few days of my stay but was not replaced, well at least not during my 9 nights stay. There is a very small gym; again if exercising is important during your trip, you would be very disappointed. If you book the business package, you will have breakfast in the smaller restaurant which is designated exclusively for business people while there is always a long queue outside the main restaurant. It is a good idea to book the business package, although the breakfast is basic but adequate.Service is the highlight. In fact, it is the highlight of Japan.

I was finally upgraded for free to a Plaza Lux corner room the last day, which is a bit bigger, bigger room with real King size bed and a separate shower cabin. The benefit of staying in the Plaza floor is that there is a separate check-in counter where you can avoid the long queue of tourists, bearing in mind it's a big hotel and there is always a queue for checking in and out. Guests staying on the Plaza floor get the use of the Lounge at the top floor free; where they offer coffee, tea and soft drink and snacks for free.It's an average hotel located within walking distance to almost everything; the frequent shuttle bus service between the hotel and airport is a great selling point.

For the 1st 4 nights, I experienced wonderful Japanese hospitality. I checked out and went to Kawaguchiko for one night and came back to Keio. To my horror, my triple sharing was not registered with the hotel. On top of that, when I checked out, I was told to pay Japan hotel tax even though my first 4 nights stay had no such tax when I checked out. The front desk were unapologetic and kept asking me to understand their situation! The hotel is conveniently located and had the airport limousine right at the hotel. If you are going to Disneyland, there is also a free shuttle bus but make sure you booked early. The rooms by Japanese standards are spacious and has sufficient space for luggages. The triple sharing is also good because they give you a real bed instead of a foldable sofa bed. In my first room 1230, I found falsies on the carpet.

Must collect luggage ticket inorder to collect at end of bus ride. There is no need to download your own luggage from bus as porter do their jobs diligently with pride.

Airport shuttle bus TO airport, buy early at concierge vending machine! Only one bus per hour interval, so seats are limited for hotel guests. If hotel pre-allocated seats taken up, you can try your luck at next bus stop - Shinjuku station (but open air bus stand, no seating and queue!

When we were standing in front of the bus, we found that our names were not on the list and the staff member at the hotel was quite rude before finally going back into the hotel to check for us. 2 minutes later he returns and says that our names aren't on the list so we can't get on. At this point we were kind of pissed off and my wife then explained to him the situation. He quickly went back into the hotel to check again and came back after another 2 minutes apologizing and saying that it was a mistake on their end.

The main facilities are good and well kept. It is not a stand out hotel except for its location and helpful staff. The floor staff were able to help with restaurant bookings and other information. The buffet breakfast was plentiful but very busy. If you arrived after 7.30am be prepared to wait about ten min to be seated.

The renewed superior twin - did not look renewed at all - so not sure if the extra we paid was worth it or not. The room was ok, but I would not have called it 4.5 star. The Tatami suite was beautiful - we paid ALOT more for it - but was worth every cent. Had 2 large rooms (1 for the futons and the other had a small table and TV ) and the bathroom was spacious. We were on level 10 - so still had great views of Shinjuku skyline. I think there was a communication problem as they didn't make the futons for us at the time specified, but eventually we told them just to make the futons and leave them out. We rented a pram online - the owner at the ryokan from the ski resort - did it online for us as it was all in japanese. It was fantastic - delivered on time to Keio and was seamless, was half expecting it not to turn up - and they pick the pram up from the hotel as well once we were done with it. The buffet breakfast which was included in our Tatami suite - was good for the 1st few days, but the menu DID NOT change at all - the same thing every single day - the variety not as good as other hotels we have stayed at e.g.. Shangri-la Hotels - so if they had a different dish every 2nd day or something, it would of made it better. The hotel was very large had about 7 + restaurants of which to dine from (only 3 of them can be used for the breakfast) - expensive compared to what you can get at the shops. As the hotel was so large I felt that I was just another customer, the staff were polite, but I wouldn't say warm, friendly or welcoming. The place we stayed at the ski resort - the service was impeccable and the staff were so nice and warm. At Keio they were just there to do there job. Every time we stay at the Shangri-la hotels (in Singapore, Malaysia) the staff are so nice and friendly and chat to you, ask you questions etc.. But this also could be a language/culture thing? anyway, I would probably try another hotel if I was to return to Shinjuku - it was great, but not AWESOME.. Our stay at Nozawa Onsen was AWESOME! The upside - they offered free shuttle bus to Disneyland and Disneysea - book in early though as they fill up real quick - and i would recommend the 630am time slot.

The bathroom was also large with a deep bath with shower over - big fluffy towels. Large cupboards with drawers, also an iron and board provided. A pod coffee maker plus tea making facilities. Everything was spotlessly clean. Checkin and checkout was quick with staff always polite and welcoming. We breakfasted in the buffet (Asian/Western) once and in the Western buffet twice. The choices were excellent and always fresh. We had one meal in a hotel restaurant - Chinese style food which was good quality and tasty but reasonably priced. Access to Shinjuku railway station was a 10 minute walk either through interesting streets or through an underground walkway.

You're also really conveniently located just outside of Shinjuku station - it's a 10 minute walk from the station through the underground shopping plaza in the direction of Tokyo Government Building which is right across the road (and has a great FREE observatory with fabulous views over Tokyo). The important thing to note about the Keio Plaza is that the rooms are refurbished to different standards, so you need to be aware of this when you book. You want a refurbished room in the south tower as these are really recently refurbished and are therefore much, much nicer. If there's a small/reasonable price difference, then it's worth paying it. The website is excellent though, and does tell you which rooms are in the main versus south tower, so read through the different room types carefully before you book. We were originally in a ""renovated"" room in the main tower but weren't really happy with it so we spoke to one of the managers who moved us first to another room in the main tower and then to a room in the south tower. I'm going to give the Keio Plaza 5/5 for customer service because this gentleman was extremely proactive in finding a solution to keep us - the customer - happy. He even sent a box of chocolates to our room which was a lovely gesture. You don't often find customer service like this anymore, especially not in such a big hotel. He really did go above and beyond. The room we ended up in was PERFECT - spotlessly clean and modern, enormous with twin beds and a chaise lounge to relax on, in-room wifi, a modern bathroom and powder room. It was everything we had hoped for, and more.

I chose this hotel because I have heard of good reviews of this hotel from people who have stayed at this hotel and also because it was the only hotel in Tokyo that could fit in a triple-share room (according to my travel agent). The hotel has a large, spacious lobby with some sofa and chairs. We received a free upgrade to a bigger room that has a dresser, which was cool. The hotel staff were polite and helpful though not entirely fluent in English. Guest room was new, clean, odourless, and very comfortable. Housekeepers were very helpful although they were less conversant in English than the front desk staff. I managed to communicate with them through gesturing and used my basic Japanese language proficiency. Our travel package came with breakfast in the hotel, so we visited all three restaurants for breakfast. It was quite shocking to see that at 8.30am, the queues for all restaurants were very long! I have never seen guests queuing up to such an extent for breakfast before in other hotels (in other countries and my own country). Usually, the breakfast queue is short, with about 2-3 families queuing and they are often offered a table each in about 2-5mins. But for these 3 restaurants in Keio Plaza Hotel, the wait can be up to 20mins to get in! It was ok for us because we were not in a mighty big rush but having to queue for so long for breakfast was perturbing. The hotel stationed some staff to try to ease the queues by asking guests in the queue if they would like to head to a shorter queue of another restaurant but no one moved. The longest queue observed for all four mornings that I was there was the Glass Court's Super Buffet. I think this is overly hyped up because it is still a breakfast buffet but it is probably marketed as a 'super' buffet because it has porridge (Jurin only serves rice), Japanese roasted tea, Japanese natto, and a couple of variety of cakes. Otherwise, I would think that Jurin would suffice for breakfast because it also serves a sumptuous buffet spread. Both Glass Court and Jurin have egg stations so you can ask the chef to fry scrambled eggs, omelettes (you get to choose the ingredients inside) or sunny side-ups. Onsen eggs are available in the buffet spread. For those who have not tried a genuinely Japanese breakfast before, be sure to head to Kagari, the Japanese restaurant that serves Japanese breakfast by individual sets. You will be asked if you would like rice or porridge and then you wait to be served. Japanese breakfast sets are very intricate because they have small side dishes all neatly stored in colourful porcelain ware. These make the dining experience very exciting and intriguing because you get to taste different types of small side dishes such as candied walnuts with anchovies and preserved vegetables. For drinks, you can get them from an open area which serves juices, coffee/tea, and water. This hotel has a very good marketing strategy. I was given a membership card when I checked in. This is enticing. Well, also, I have stayed in another hotel in Tokyo before so I really appreciate Keio Plaza for being larger, cleaner, more spacious and and more Japanese. A positive mention of the hotel's bell desk. They are highly organised and neat. Guests who arrived at the hotel earlier than the check in time could leave their luggage with the bell desk. Staff at the bell desk will tag each piece of luggage and wheel them into a secured area that looks something like a warehouse, to store them. We passed them our luggage when we checked out at 545am and headed for breakfast at 6am. When we returned to the lobby to wait for our bus limousine, the staff had already helped us wheel the luggage out and placed them neatly together. These staff are not men only; there are young ladies who have a lot of strength to carry, hoist and push many suitcases at a go too! This was impressive. I hardly see females working at the bell desk because suitcases and luggage may be too daunting for them but for the Japanese bell desk staff, they are superb!",Singapore,"Adelyn T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",7,4.0

Staff are very friendly and helpful, the hotel is immaculately clean and is very close to Shinjuku station - about 10 minutes walk (under cover) when you learn the layout. Allow at least 20 -30 minutes the first time around! Shinjuku is BIG. Staff are all able to communicate adequately in English, or are able to refer to someone who has the ability for more complex questions.There are several restaurants ""in-house"" offering a variety of food styles - tepanyaki, korean, italian, casual etc. - and there are many other eating places close by. The hotel food prices are rather steep, but in line with expectations for this level of accommodation, ranging from Y2500 to Y10,000. The breakfast buffet is highly recommended.There is a small convenience store on Level 1 in the South Tower which is well stocked with food and drink items and toiletries, and reasonably priced.My only negative comment is that, like all shops and hotels that i visited in Japan, the heating was rather too high in the public areas (in winter). Room air conditioning was adjustable and very adequate.On the other side, elevators are quick and quiet, and the free wi-fi is very fast.We were holidaying in Japan for 3 weeks and stayed here for 3 nights each arriving and departing.

The airport has bus routes which stop at this hotel. Of course, this isn't the only hotel covered, but this hotel is closest walk to the maze called Shinjuku station.  A 10 minute partial covered walk will take you the the large crazy maze. However, there are ample shopping and eating places in the area, so no worries for boredom!However, the hotel is large, filled with tourists, and unfortunately they can get a bit loud. The old wing has walls that don't particularly block the sound, so a late night mother daughter argument was very well articulated. Most are staying here for the same reason I was, - easy access. So if luxury, discreet and a more calm atmosphere is what you want.. look elsewhere.Breakfast options were divided into many areas, but for Western fare, pick 'super buffet'. More variety, except that it doesn't change. Room service was prompt and rooms were cleaned spotlessly daily. Size was pretty decent (twin room). Toilet and bath are large for hotel standards. Quite a few plugs to handle the ipad, iphones, camera chargers and whatnot. Wifi was a bit spotty, so get a SIM data card to avoid frustration.The bar at the top floor had great views of the Tokyo skyline & the Metropolitan Govt building, but the drinks were not cheap. Seek alternatives.Tip: from Haneda airport consider buying the hotel airport + 3 day tokyo metro pass (does not include JR) if you plan to seriously trek around and shopTip2: Reserve your bus seat back to Haneda airport once you checked in.

Central, 5 mins to Shinjuku and on top of a subway station, surrounded by restaurants and shops. Can't be beaten for convenience. Airport bus drops you at the hotel. - breakfast. Choice of 3 restaurants, we always ate at Jurin. Great choice, and we never queued. - convenience shop and cake shop in the basement; great for buying milk for our baby and midnight snacks!!- fantastic nursing room on the lobby floor, with microwave you can use for sterilising etc. Also a nursery on 30th floor; we didn't use it but nice to at least have a room for kids to run about in. And a few major downsides:- they point blank refused to accommodate our 1 year old baby. In advance I e-mailed the hotel to ask if they could provide a travel cot. They told me no as not enough space. So I said ok, please could you provide a mattress on the floor. They again said no. So I said ok no problem, we will bring our own. They AGAIN said no, saying it was against their policy!! They would only provide a bed rail so that our wriggly 1 year old could share the small double bed with me (pregnant) and my husband. When we arrived our room was very large and had a space of at least 6x4m next to the bed, so I was pleased we had ignored their e-mails and brought our own solution. But I am staggered they would refuse to provide any type of bedding for a baby (even if they charged it would be OK). We have travelled to a huge variety of countries and hotels almost monthly since my son was born and this is the first time I have ever experienced anything like this. - cleanliness. The room was very dated and needed renovation; carpets were grubby, walls heavily marked, furniture old. It had clearly been cleaned before we arrived but it is too old really. And they left a dirty cup in the room for 2 days; not a big deal but I don't think cleanliness is high on their list. Bathroom was a bit better. - staff variable. Some were lovely and very helpful, others acted like they couldn't wait to be rid of you. All were polite, just some were friendlier than others.

There's only thing that fell short of our expectations: when we called housekeeping to request for more bottled water for the room, we were told there was a limit of 2 bottles per room per day. Seriously?? i'm knocking 1 star off the rating for this. no skin off my back to go downstairs to buy some water from the convenience store on the ground floor. its a really small detail, but i expected more from Keio Plaza; this isn't Sunroute Plaza or Washington Shinjuku. neutral point - late checkout was denied. checkout at 11am. not a big issue as we could leave our bags with the concierge. overall the staff, room and restaurant were great. but hotel management needs to look into their policy on bottled water. and maybe better selection of snacks for the luxe lounge. tips: 1.if you're too lazy to walk to shinjuku station, take the train from Tochomae station (Oedo line) which is just outside the hotel. its one stop to shinjuku. great if you have kids who are always moaning ""I'm so tired, i don't want to walk...""2. there's a FANTASTIC playground at Shinjuku park, great for kids from 2-12. ask the staff for directions. its a short walk, about 500m from the hotel. no moaning from the kids when walking to the playground.","Earth, Texas","Cloudymorning</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Earth, Texas</strong>",0,3.0

Just outside the back entrance to the hotel is a tunnel through which a five minute walk will take you to the West Gate Underground Plaza part of the very convenient Shinjuku station, from where you can go to just about anywhere in Tokyo. Behind the hotel is the Tokyo Metropolitan Goverrnment building, you can go up for free to observation decks in each of the two towers to see stunning views. This is better, in my opinion, than going up Tokyo Tower or Skytree as you can see both of these attractions rather than being in them. We could even see Mt. Fuji on the day we went. Shinjuku post office is 200 metres from the hotel and you can use international cards at the ATMs there. There are many restaurants near the hotel, and even a pachinko place, although we often ate in the restaurants in the department stores at Shinjuku station. We used the laundry service, a week's worth of washing for the four of us was 140,000 yen. Everything was returned in impeccable condition, individually folded with tissue paper and then wrapped in plastic. While the hotel is enormous and, as a result, quite impersonal, the wonderful location makes this a great choice.","Sydney, Australia","Belinda M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",33,5.0

The lady at the reception told me that children are only for kids under 5 years of age. Therefore she said instead, i should have chosen 3 adults in the option. What the heck?? She did apologize profusely that the hotel's reservation website does not state so.Second, despite booking a bigger room called plaza premier, the room can not accommodate 3 'adults' but funny enough, the smaller superior twin can. Thus, need to cancel my plaza premier reservation and change to superior twin...BIG surprise.. The receptionist couldn't cancel it for me directly from the hotel's system. Solution: i need to go online and cancel it hence she can rebook me in the renovated superior twin from the hotel's system. Okay...Third, i found out that the rate she quoted me was higher rate than hotel's own website. Told her that and she said she could not match the online rate. So guess what? Despite being right in front of the check-in counter, i need to go online again to reserve same room with lower rate.Fourth, after check-in, we asked for 2 additional bottle of water, and the answer is flat NO. 1 bottle per person per stay.

But this room was definitely new! Location wise was alright - about 5 to 7 mins walk from the Shinjuku main station.

We were allocated better rooms in the previous two stays, where the rooms were renovated.During check-in, I was given the Executive Card, which provided some benefits for its members, including an access to the Luxe Lounge. However, when I tried accessing the Luxe Lounge, the entry was refused, and as I tried to enquire further about the terms and conditions, the staff did not want to explain and referred me to speak to the front desk instead. The attitude was not what I was expecting from a Japanese hotel. This time the overall experience was rather a put-off.

There is an Underground Passage Way at Shinjuku Station, always filled with thousands of pedestrians. It is an absolute pleasure & delight to watch incoming passengers walking on the left & outgoing passengers walking on the right. No one bumps into each other, pushes or shoves. There is a great cohesiveness amongst the Japanese, their culture & methods are incredibly orchestrated, sweet like sugar and everything nice.

The west side mainly is business district while retail shops and restaurants are more centrally located on the east side of Shinjuku station. Given Shinjuku is one of the main stations with different metro and JR lines, staying in this area minimize the connecting trains when taking public transportation. Transportation: limousine bus available from NRT airport to/from the hotel. For those who have returning flight before 10am, this is one of the very few hotels in Shinjuku that has the first bus leaves at 5:50am. Narita Express (NEX) is another option, it's faster than limousine bus but you will arrive or depart at Shinjuku station instead of hotel's front entrance. Hotel: Few reviews mentioned check in line was long. It could be that we checked in at around 7pm, there was no line. As some reviews mentioned that the rooms are dated, that's why we paid a higher rate for renovated rooms and the rooms look the same as what's in the pictures on their website. Spacious for Japanese standard and clean. We accidentally got a queen size bed instead of two twin beds but it works out well because we had our 4 year old slept on the couch with it pushed next to the bed as a bed extension. It ends up with more space in the room. We booked this hotel for a few reasons - location, limousine bus drop off/pick up right at the hotel, early pick up for limousine bus for morning flight, free shuttle to Disney, and convenience store/restaurants inside the hotel. Tips: - If you are traveling with kids and/or with lots of luggage like us, take the limousine bus. NEX requires a good 10 minute walk (assuming you don't get lost) or you will need to flag a taxi from the station to hotel. Be aware that it will take over 1.5 hrs during rush hours if you go with the bus option. - Train station exit to the hotel is West Exit. Just follow west exit sign and as you get closer. you can find Keio Plaza Hotel on the signs for which direction to go. - Free Disney shuttle requires reservation. You can request it through their website. - You can include breakfast as one of the booking options. There are 3 restaurants to choose from: western buffet, western and Japanese buffet, or Japanese set breakfast. All of them are 3000 yen per person and you get 10% off for hotel guest if you pay it at the restaurant. If you are looking to have breakfast at the hotel, it is cheaper if you book the rooms with breakfast options but do your math as some days you might not be able to make it if you have early morning itineraries.- We booked a day tour for Mt. Fuji through viator (local tour company called sunrise tour) in advance. You can also book it at the hotel for pretty much the same price. We would definitely be staying at this hotel again.

The staff were polite and the rooms were clean. However, from photos on tripadvisor, the hotel website and & a friend's visit last year, we were expecting a bit more. I now understand that there are two towers, with the South Tower as the most recently renovated, which we didn't stay in. Our room was a bit on the ordinary side and not what I was expecting given all the photos I had seen. Another let down was the Wifi - which only seemed to work outside the hotel. We had a very frustrating morning, waiting for friends to contact us but with no Wifi, we were stuck. The staff were very helpful, lending us the use of an iPad at the front desk, but this did not resolve the ongoing Wifi drop outs. The two bars on the top floor were great, particularity the Polestar Bar, with dazzling night time views of the Tokyo Metropolitan Building. Overall, our stay leaned more towards average than anything higher. Could not fault the staff, but there was certainly no WOW factor to our stay here.

The airport bus from Narita direct to the hotel door was very convenient especially after a long flight. Check in took some time, the staff member took our passports & disappeared for some 15 minutes, I felt concern about that but once she returned I noticed a trainee badge. Just would have been good if she could communicate that she was going to photocopy them etc not just walk off. The hotel room was dated & worn, with bumps & dents in the furniture not really what you'd hope for paying over $350. I wanted to book this as a birthday treat so I guess paying that amount I expected a little more. The room was of a reasonable size for Japan. Our room smelt so badly of smoke, I couldn't breathe or sleep. My eyes were all red, even our clothes started to take on that horrible dirty smoke smell. The next day I asked to please be moved to a non smoking room, I was told the hotel didn't have any. They gave us an air defuser to use & after a day or 2 it started to be a lot better. The staff were always kind & polite & willing to help. I found the location really great & in a quieter area. The other handy thing was the Disney shuttle direct pick up & the hotel was a meeting point for one of our tours. So for those sort of reasons it's a good choice. We stayed for 7 nights. Personally i would stay at the hotel gracery instead. For me it was cheaper & more modern.

They usually have rooms even if you make bookings close to your travel dates, it's conveniently located near Shinjuku station with lots of shopping and restaurants. And if you are traveling with kids, they have free shuttle buses to and fro Disneyland resorts. Airport limousine stops here. Most of those remain and you can continue rely on them. Some other things have changed though. The room was HOT when I checked in. Curtains were left open and the sun had heated up the room. The AC didn't work because the system had been changed to heating for winter. Toilet was not clean (You won't want details on this, trust me). There were leftover pop corns under the bedside table. I asked to extend my check out time by one hour and was rejected. Not that I expected the request to be granted. But the rejection was rather curt. Imagine getting that kind of rejection in a culture that has difficulty saying no. I waited close to 5 minutes to get help to reserve a seat on airport limousine bus while bell boys ignored us.

The room has well stocked with all kinds of toiletries, robes (western and Japanese), and slippers. The bathroom was remodeled but they used faux marble counters and shower surround which detracted from the overall quality of the room. There were a few stains on the carpet, but the room was clean. Beds are super firm and it had electronic shades. The plaza lounge is in the south tower and the premier plaza rooms are in the main tower. It is a relaxing venue, with an assortment of beverages and snacks. Some of the guests were chowing down on the canapés, but it wasn't enough for a meal substitute. The buffet breakfast at Jurin was very nice, large selection mostly western and some Japanese dishes. The selection of western and asian choices improves in the Glass Court buffet. We ate early, around 6am, so never had to wait in line. The location is superb, close to Shinjuku station, the busiest in Japan, and large department stores that have a food court on the upper floor with many restaurants, and a huge selection of take out food in the basement. There are many restaurants within walking distance between the hotel and the train station. We stayed here because it was part of the package offered through JTB Sunrise tours which offers a wide range of hotel choices and Keio Plaza was supposed to be a 4 star quality if upgraded to premier plaza. The staff were helpful and courteous, and refused tips. Overall, a good choice for Tokyo.",Hawaii,"bougainvilla</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawaii</strong>",43,4.0

We never experienced any waits for breakfast which was surprisingly very good. Great coffee and solicitous service. Rooms were clean. Toto Toilets are the best in the world. Love the abundance of amenities: Terry Robes, Yukata and Pajamas for each guest. Front desk service was excellent and gave us a generous 3 PM check out which we didn't really need.

The room itself, on the 36th floor of the main tower was excellent: a decent size by any standards with a king-sized bed ""by Simmons"" - I have to say one of the best hotel beds I've slept in; really steady even if your jet-lagged partner bounces around. The layout of the room allowed both a pleasant sofa and a convenient seat for reading with a little table by the side of both in addition to a functional desk for working, without feeling crammed at all. My wife was also very pleased with a little makeup desk that rounded the offering. Stowage was a little more limited.Sound proofing was absolutely superb, again one of the best experienced in any hotel. The view from the room was very nice too, overlooking the Tokyo metropolitan government building, with a strip of windows running the full length of the room that let in plenty of daylight. All in all a very comfortable room that it felt good coming back to in the evening.The only letdown was the bathroom; bizarrely this was some sort of prefab plastic thing with a low ceiling (< 2m) and very dim lighting, which made shaving very difficult. Not really a match for a 5 stars hotel ""Premier room""...The Premier room comes with access to the ""Luxe"" lounge, which provides complimentary drinks until 10 I believe, but is situated at the top of the hotel's other tower so a good 5+ minutes distance depending on luck with the lifts. The meagre snacks selection didn't make that stroll particularly worthwhile; beers were more generous.Location of the hotel is great as others have said, for both travel links out of the massive Shinjuku station which is perhaps 5 mins away, and for dining and entertainment. We tried one of the hotel's restaurants one evening but the service was overwhelmed with the number of guests so we left after 10 mins as no one managed to even provide a menu. That said this was no issue at all given the wealth of excellent restaurants that can be enjoyed within a 500m radius; and for those feeling more adventurous there are even more choices on the other side of Shinjuku station, perhaps 10 mins away. We would certainly be happy to come back...","Geneva, Switzerland","candgx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",7,4.0

Rooms were nice, beds very comfortable and couch/desk in room. Service was slow at front desk due to what appears to be a very long winded booking system, and there can be a slight language barrier in understanding requests, although all staff speak English. The front desk was always staffed by Trainees during our stay resulting in things taking longer. Be sure to book a non smoking room and check this when you check in. We stayed for a couple of nights ahead of a work trip, unfortunately my work colleagues were all allocated to smoking rooms as it wasn't specified at time of booking. We were as well, and it took us 45mins speaking to reception to be moved to a non smoking room. Hotel was full so they couldn't reallocate my colleagues when they later arrived resulting in Hotel staff spraying room with air fresher to mask the smell. Good selection of Japanese and Western Breakfast options. Whilst there are a number of restaurants you can choose from for Buffet Breakfast, you can expect to queue up if you go to breakfast after 7.30 if they are busy. We queued for almost 30 mins one morning at 7.20am. When we finally got into the restaurant, there were a number of empty tables. We raised this with one of the restaurant staff and they just laughed. We raised a compliant at reception which took 45 mins to get a resolution and 3 staff including the duty manager. It was an extremely frustrating process. Check out also took 30 mins as there was an issue with our bill. We stayed at another 5* Hotel the night before moving across to the Keio Plaza Hotel, and their service levels far exceeded the Keio Plaza. There are a number of restaurant choices in the hotel and it is very close to Shinjuku station. There is airport bus to/from hotel for $1250Yen or you can catch the subway. Be sure to visit the bar on Level 45 for great views. My colleagues used the gym and said it was quite small for the size of the hotel and pool is outside so only open during summer.

We chose this hotel as we were intending to visit Disneyland and also needed a room for three.The Disneyland shuttles, airport transfers, location and room size are the major plus for Keio Plaza. It is a lot more convenient to take the Disney Shuttle as it takes roughly 20-30 minutes by coach from the hotel and gets you directly to the main entrance of the theme park. The hotel is also about a 7 minutes walk from the JR Shinjuku West exit. There is a Yodabashi and many food options along the way from the station to the hotel, so it is very convenient to get food. There are also a couple of convenience stores in the surrounding area.The room is big, clean but nothing too fancy. It serves its purpose well - if the price is right. The only downside is that the hotel gets crowded (so check-in takes a while and you probably won't have a ready room early) and that the price point is rather high. I would choose to stay in other hotels if I am not visiting Disneyland or need a bigger room.

So far day 2 but I thought I'd relate a salutary experience so others might benefit from what happened to Mr Gumby.The hotel room has an e-toilet and by that I mean one with a panel full of buttons next to it to ease the experience of evacuating one's bowels or bladder. Of course Mr Gumby could not resist these buttons for what is a button for if not for pressing? So Mr Gumby is enthroned having done what was needed and decided to press the button which looked like it might send a gentle spray up to the nether regions and was rewarded with a continuous jet of water hitting the area it was presumably designed to hit. After about 20 seconds Mr Gumby had had enough and decided to turn it off. So he pressed the button again, to no avail. Thinking that there was perhaps a delay Mr Gumby waited , but no, the stream of water continued its relentless journey upwards into Mr Gumby's bottom. Now slightly panicking Mr Gumby hit the button again, but nothing. Then Mr Gumby saw an on/off button which he hit straight away. All that did was to turn of the very pleasant toilet seat heater off. Now mild panic started to set in and worst case scenarios flashed through Mr Gumby's mind. What if it couldn't turn off? A flooded floor, building collapse due to water damaged concrete? Even worse the indignity of having to leap off the toilet, force the lid down whilst the relentless geyser of water tried to escape the pan and then having to shout to Mrs Gumby to call the hotel engineers to fix the problem. That particular vision had the indignity of the engineers arriving in the room to be greeted with the vision of a pink and very clean posterior bent over the toilet trying to keep the lid closed. Finally Mr Gumby espied an orange button with the word OFF on it and hit it as fast as he could. The jet of water stopped! Mr Gumby declares and avows that, at this moment in time, he has the cleanest backside in Japan if not the world and henceforth will always look for an 'off' button before pressing an 'on' button.","Coolangatta, Australia","MrGumby555</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coolangatta, Australia</strong>",26,4.0

In conjunction with a congress apparantly happening in the hotel that led to warning signs of elevated waiting times at times of high usage (and we had to wait in que some 10 minutes to get access to the elevator once).","Vienna, Austria","BusTravVie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Austria</strong>",48,4.0

I arrived at 11am to check in however was informed that I could not check in until 14:00. The staff were unfriendly and when I asked if any room would be available early it seemed an inconvenience.When I did finally check in the room was nothing like in the pictures. We were in the older part of the hotel and therefore the rooms looked like something out of the 1950s. The carpet was stained and there was dirt everywhere especially underneath any of the furniture. We were also near the elevators which shook our room every couple of minutes giving me a sea sick feeling.Eventually we complained at reception and was moved rooms, again it seemed like an inconvenience. This room was a little cleaner but still not great and my bedding had stains on it. The only bonus to the hotel was the location as there is a selection of restaurants nearby and it was very close to Shinjuku train station. We did not try the food at the hotel as it was very expensive compared to the restaurants outside.For our finally night we upgraded to the Hello Kitty two rooms. These were brilliant but for the cost of nearly £280 a night I would expect it. They are decorated very well and we are glad we ended our holiday on a high point in the two rooms.The hotel did agree to store our luggage while we travelled to Kyoto however even that caused issues as although I informed them that several bags had fragile items, they still chucked my heavy bags on top of them.Overall I would not return to this hotel as it was the worst hotel I stayed in during my holiday in Japan. I heave been informed that the renovated rooms are apparently better and what is pictured on the booking websites, however they should include pictures of the older rooms so people know what they are getting themselves in for. My advise is to book one of these rooms or the Hello Kitty rooms.","Bristol, United Kingdom","sweet2919</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",31,2.0

Its a smoking hotel so choose your rooms wisely. Adequate lifts for a big hotel. Waiting time was minimal for the lifts. Rooms were spacious, modern and clean (Plaza Premier Room). Bathroom space and layout though were somewhat disappointing. Views facing office buildings (Tokyo metropolitan). Location: Just outside of Shinjuku. Underground Walkway to Shinjuku JR station was useful especially if it rains. Above ground can be complicated but is roughly a straight path in an alley towards the JR station - along the way you can buy drinks and snacks from the convenient stores, check out the latest trends in the pharmacy, stop by Standing Sushi bar for a snack and shop at Yodobashi mega electronic stall. It is also convenient if you are taking the local buses to other areas outside Tokyo as the major Bus terminus is there. The Odakyu romancecar station to Hakone is also located just across from the bus terminus. The department store is located above the train station and food/supermarket at the basement. Its s bit more complicated if you wish to walk to Isetan side of Shinjuku as you will have to locate and underpass hidden in an alley way. Did not dine at the hotel but noted there were large restaurants with buffet options for international cuisine and Japanese as well. One plus point is the free shuttle bus to Disney Sea and Disney Land stop at the hotel with specified timings. Do make a booking with the Bell Hop the day before to book your seat on the shuttle bus. There is also a return shuttle from Disney to the hotel - do take note of the departure timings and be punctual!

I In-room service wise, I called for a shiatsu massage one of the night as I was feeling tired after a long day of shopping. I opted for 1hr 30mins massage thinking that the japanese will be better in shiatsu than if I were to do balinese/thai massage (in japan, right?). To my disappointment, the massage by the therapist was substandard and it was more like a mere implied pressure on my body than the legit way of finger pressure massage. I would not recommend doing shiatsu massage in house. Location wise was a short walk to Odaiku and other major departmental stores like Isetan and Takashimaya. All in all, I would recommend this hotel for its location (if you intend on shinjuku that is) and it's price.

Experience was great until we stayed in Keio. Please bear in mind that this is the Plaza Premier (Pretty much an executive room) room we are referring to.1) location - great with 10 min walk to Shinjuku station. 2) Check in - chaotic lobby with no porter on hand to send our luggage up.3) Room - decent space but this is once again the plaza Premier room. Toiletries are branded.4) service - Firstly, the hotel is so busy that no one ( bell captain/ front desk/ concierge ) picks up the phone. Secondly, as we booked 2 rooms and had a flight at 4pm. We asked to check out late for 1 of the 2 rooms at 1.30pm which is pretty much just an hour and a half longer than the regular timing. The Premier front desk lady (Fukuda), who was extremely polite, said it was hotel policy and she could not do anything about our request unless we paid for an extension. We reiterated that we had a 2 yo and a pregnant traveler but she could do nothing because it is ""hotel policy"". So much for the family hotel brand they try to portray. Thirdly, we asked for a recycled carton box to pack some of our excess purchases for our flight but once again, the hotel wanted to charge for a new box. Ironically, the hotel room has a sign that states that we need to help the hotel save the environment. This was the last straw that resulted in this post.I hope this does not come across as too negative but we hope that future travellers take heed of our experience and decide for themselves if this is for them.","Singapore, Singapore","AdrianL3142</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",6,1.0

Only tea and bar services are provided. However, the hotel does take an effort to change the snack variety on a daily basis.For those who would be using the subway, just take note that there is a station named Tochomae station which is very very near the hotel, and a direct stop away from the Shinjuku station. Location is not too bad as it is about a slow 10 minutes stroll to the heart of Shinjuku where plenty of eateries and shopping are available (near the Odakyu dept store, where it also happens to be the boarding point for buses going to Gotemba premium outlet).Do take note that if you want to take the airport limo bus departing from the hotel, you have to make a reservation beforehand with the hotel staff to secure a seat. This is in addition to making a payment at the automatic vending machine at the hotel, where you will be issued a bus ticket.Wifi speed was acceptable.Would definitely consider going back to this hotel but will not pay extra for the Plaza Luxe with lounge access.","Singapore, Singapore","chillipadichua</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",47,4.0

We were very pleased with our choice of this hotel. It is less than 10 minutes walking to the Shinjuku Station which was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel. As seems to be the case in Tokyo, there are plenty of restaurants nearby. There is also a shopping mall near the train station and many other large stores nearby. Right next to the hotel is the government building where tourists can go (for free!) to the 45th floor to get a 360 view of Tokyo (and Mt. Fuji). There's also a pretty nice park next to the government buildings (and a 15 minute walk to a large Japanese garden on the other side of the train station). The hotel itself is a nice hotel with nice sized rooms. We opted for the two single beds and had a pretty large room with two chairs and a table as well (a Renewed Superior room). The bathroom was of average size with good counter space. There was a fog-less mirror and one of those toilets with the flush/bidet options that are common in Japan. There are many restaurants and bars in this hotel, as well as a bakery and convenience store. We opted for the buffet breakfast with our room and it was a modest buffet (but with good quality food). One of the people we were traveling with was disappointed that our only option was a Western buffet and that the Japanese breakfast was an additional charge. Everyone who worked at the hotel was very polite and room service was very fast to bring ice to the room when we needed it. Also, we had no difficulty with English at the hotel and they were very accommodating of my husband's dairy allergy (having soy milk ready for him every morning at the buffet).

Our room for two was comfortable with strong wifi signal. I do not recommend triple sharing because i found our other triple sharing room quite pricey, considering the third bed was just a sofa bed, and the size of the room was exactly the same as the double sharing room so there's not much space to move for triple occupancy.

Even though there is a 3 year gap between my accommodations, the quality stayed the same if not better. First of all, the location is very central and its walking distance to the Shinjuku station. If you dont want to bother with the metro on your way from the airport (which can be very crowded at certain times) you can always hop on to the ""friendly bus limousine"" service at the airport and it will take you directly to the hotel. The rooms are always clean and the staff is very friendly. Communication was not a problem with me because I found that there are staff members who speaks good english. When it comes to pricing I think the amount is fair considering the quality of the hotel. It is said to be 4 star hotel but during my stays I felt like its more like 4 and a half star. During my research I was looking at the 3 star hotels around the area and the rooms they had were too smal for a family visit. I dont think it would be confortable if you are 2 or more people. And the pricing of the 5 stars were really high for my taste. So this hotel with its quality/price and wider selection of rooms stood out for me.If its your first time in japan I would definitely recommend this hotel. The only thing you should chek before booking is the breakfast. There are different restaurants in the hotel and the prices differ. If you decide to buy the breakfast during your stay I dont think you ll be dissappointed because it was very rich, but if you decide not to buy it you can always walk across the street and get something for the road from the shops.So overall I was very happy with my visit and definitely would like to stay here again","Ankara, Turkey","ozdogancan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ankara, Turkey</strong>",29,5.0

I travelled with my husband and 2 year old. We chose the hotel because of the relatively attractive price, its location and the good reviews we had read on Tripadvisor. We were not disappointed.We had a room in the new wing and the room was of a generous size by hotel standards worldwide (not to mention Tokyo). There was space for an arm chair, a little chaise lounge and a dressing table. The bed was comfortable, the sheets clean and the towels white and fluffy. The bathroom amenities comprising of L'Occitane products and a Shiseido Face wash was also a real treat. There is both a hot water kettle and a Nespresso machine in the room which was perfect for us.From the airport, we would recommend taking the Airport Limousine Bus. The ride is comfortable and the fare is fixed. With peak hour traffic, the taxis can prove to be pretty expensive from the airport, especially Narita. The Airport Limousine Bus drops you right at the doorstep of the Keio Plaza Hotel. Do the same for your return trip to the airport.It was also very convenient moving around from the Keio Plaza Hotel. On the ground floor (below the main lobby entrance), when you exit from the new wing, to the right of the hotel is the path to the Shinkjuku train station (approximately the length of 4 full-length travellators) and to the left, barely 100 m away is the Tochomae station. Once you get to the Shinjuku station area, you will also be in area where the department stores are such as Odakyu and Lumine. There are also lots of eateries in the area and some of which have good reviews written up by bloggers.What we thought was a real value add was the fact that the hotel provided free transport to and from Disneyland. There are 3 pick up times to Disneyland and another 3 return times. This is really convenient and you should book early because it does fill up. Many other tours also do pick ups from the Keio Plaza Hotel which is very convenient.The room rates we paid for the hotel did not include breakfast. But in Tokyo, this really doesn't matter given that there are so many eateries in the area. This gave us the opportunity to try different restaurants, all walking distance from the hotel. There was an awesome dipping ramen place which we tried as well as an Udon joint where udon noodles were served with a whole buffet of tempura items. If you don't want to venture too far for breakfast, there is a bakery in the hotel itself as well as a supermarket/convenience store which stays open till really late. If buying bottled water, buy it from here rather than the Family Marts nearby as the price difference is quite negligible.We had a very good stay in Tokyo and staying at the Keio Plaza Hotel certainly added significantly to the enjoyment of the holiday.","Singapore, Singapore","allyphant</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",45,5.0

It was extremely quiet. The traffic noise was barely noticeable, and I don't think I ever heard anyone in the hall or in adjacent rooms. The information card said the rooms had been specially sound proofed, and I'd say that was true. We were on the 35th floor of the north tower and overlooked the government building. The city view was very nice. The staff was very helpful when we checked in late at night. We had reserved seats on the courtesy bus to Disney Sea, and they had all the paperwork ready for us. I had also signed up for their club and they had my membership card waiting for me. The lobby can be a zoo during the mornings, since there are many tour groups who stay there. It's all handled I'm a very orderly fashion. The people and bags are kept to one zone, so it's easy to avoid them. I'm not a breakfast eater, so we didn't visit the Japanese or Western buffets. I was happy that there was a Starbucks just across the street where I could pick up coffee and a scone. Just go down to level 2 (below the lobby level) and go out the doors by Poppins, which is h hotel's bakery shop, and cross the street. Starbucks is on the lower level of the plaza. Poppins also has good scones, rolls and pastries, but no coffee. There is a coffee maker and tea supplies in the hotel room, but it was nice to have a larger size cup. The hotel location is a quick (5 to 10 mins), covered walk to Shinjuku station. Go out the same doors as mentioned above and go to the right once you get to the sidewalk. You'll see the tunnel. There's also a subway station if you turn left from the hotel. It's not even half a block to the entrance. Between that subway station and the subways/trains at Shinjuku, you can get pretty much anywhere. There are a lot of places to eat just steps away from the hotel. You can find pretty much any quisine you want, at varying price points. Unlike the area of Shinjuku on the other side of the JR station, the local neighborhood is relatively quiet at night. You can wander around the small streets full of eateries without feeling like you're in a seedy area. That's not so true on the other side of the station. It's a lot more lively and you'll find people trading wares/services you may not want to buy. I would definitely stay at the Keio again, should I get back to Tokyo.","Honolulu, Hawaii","iflytoga</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",9,5.0

I guess the main tower could have been a bit more busy that the room in the south tower. The hotel lobby was big enough so that one did not feel cramped with all the tour groups there. Our room was of a good size, comparable to western standards. Our travel agent recommended getting a room with twin beds as they generally are of a bigger area that one with a double/queen size bed.

The Keio Plaza is part of a wider company that also has interests in transport (train and bus), so not surprising you can get a bus direct from Haneda Airport to the door. Tickets are available at an airport counter, you get a ticket for your luggage as you board which you exchange at your destination - all very efficient. Oh, and about two thirds of the bus journey is underground.We arrived at 8 am and couldn't check in until 2 pm but it was very full because we hit the cherry blossom season - we actually took our room at 1:30 pm. We were able to use the time to briefly wander around the small shopping arcade and check out the restaurants in the basement. We went out into Shinjuku and found a choice of very reasonable noodle bars and curry shops. In many you pay at a machine which has a menu, take the ticket and a seat and hand it over, that simple. We used the Polestar Bar three times. Check out the whole drinks list, we found the beer expensive but the Champagne reasonable by comparison to bar prices at home (the UK), and it leant an air of celebration to the spectacular view over Tokyo. One thing to be mindful of, in Japan it is still permitted to smoke in bars and restaurants so remember to ask for non-smoking...or smoking!Our Plaza Premier King was all that we expected, plenty of room, very quiet and well serviced. The room was fresh and contemporary which was at odds with a bathroom from a different era - a chic room with a granny bathroom (no offence granny). However, very functional, loo with more features that you thought you'd ever need, so not a problem unless you spend the majority of your stay in the bathroom.There's a really good convenience store where you can pick up a few breakfast things to get you up and out of a morning without breaking the bank with the hotel breakfast.Lots to do nearby, Shinjuku Station, Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden is a must do. and have lunch at the Yurinoki Restaurant, the food is great and the (older) ladies who work there are a treat.",Bristol,"hubhopper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol</strong>",48,4.0

We love the eateries nearby the hotel, the Shinjuku Gyoen is only 15 mins away, the shops, the convenient store and drug stores nearby provide the best value for money. They have shuttle bus to and from the airport, as well as the free shuttle to Disney, although you have to book the seat way in advance.BUT , we found that the service of the hotel is NOT CONSISTENT AND NOT UP TO 4 STAR HOTEL STANDARD. There were eight of us in our group, 6 ladies and 2 gents. We stayed at Keio for 2 nights, everything was fine and went to Kawaguchi for an overnight stay. We then return to Keio for another night. On this second visit, we arrived late at night, with lots of luggage and tired bodies. Surprisingly, unlike on our first visit when we had good impression of the hotel and services, this time the concierge refuse to bring our luggage to our rooms and told us to bring them ourselves. If the hotel was very busy at that time, we might have understood, but they were not busy and a few bell boys appear to be available. Only when we asked to speak to the manager on duty, when the concierge finally agreed to send our luggage to the room. Its not a pleasant experience at all and completely ruin the good impression we had initially. I dont know if the hotel has this inconsistency in service throughout or if the specific 'bell boy' had a long tiring night and thus the bad attitude, and to make it worse, the manager on duty actually sat just a few meters away and must have heard our irritated conversation with the bell boy and just simply ignored us and not even trying to solve matter.

Fast forward to present: While planning our anniversary/vacation trip to Tokyo with my girlfriend, my trusted travel agent told me that Keio Plaza's rep has been bugging her about how they've improved their services and the hotel has been renovated recently, etc. so I decided to give it a second chance (bad move):- Upon check-in, front desk staff wanted to charge us more because I have a +1. After some explaining, I was able to convince them to waive the fee but all these for a +1, REALLY? I chalked this up as my oversight so let's move on... (30 mins wasted)- WIFI connection is slow and intermittent. Front desk was notified and they acknowledged that there might be a coverage issue (28th floor, main tower) and their solution for my problem is... I kid you not and I quote, ""Sir, why don't you use your devices in the corridor or next to the front door?"" I was speechless and hung up... (1 hr wasted)- Keio Plaza's ISP (NEC I believe) called the next morning trying to help but they (NEC) admitted that they can only help me with logging on WIFI, not staying on WIFI. (Another hour wasted)^ all these issues happened in less than 24 hours Other info/rant:- While booking the reservation, my trusted travel agent told Keio Plaza's rep to give us ""VIP treatment""... That sure didn't happen.- Apparently not all rooms have been updated/renovated. We got the smoke-stained ""70's theme"" room by default, not by choice.- Our room smells like chimney even though we reserved a non-smoking room.- Their laundry staff can't count so make sure you count with them to prevent being overcharged.

These are our thoughts from our one week stay:The refurbished 'luxury' suites in the South Tower are supposed to be better than the regular Main Tower rooms. The Luxe suites merely update the South Tower rooms to a contemporary look in keeping with present styles. The dark faux-wood panelling is muted and tastefully stylish. The suite itself was average sized, no better or worse than many others we've stayed in and posed no restrictions when wanting to spread out and make ourselves at home. My favourite aspect of the room were the shower taps; in true reliable Japanese style these taps and shower head were precise in a way I've not experienced in other international hotels and allowed me to shower in perfect temperature comfort. No other features or aspects of the room stood out for better or worse, so we would say the suite was average in a satisfactory way.The hotel complex is massive. It is foremost a convention/conference hotel. Expect to share public space in the hotel with hordes of package tourists. Do not stay here expecting personal service; the place is geared to churn guests in and out of their rooms and service is merely courteous, efficient but perfunctory. I was surprised the hotel was established in 1971 - there is no trace of its early 70's decor anywhere which would've mitigated the hotel's 'datedness' and explained its faded charm. I could only discern an 80's vibe from the public areas and shops - that must've been the time of its last extension. Only the bars/restaurants and Luxe suites in the South Wing offer evidence of modern-day decor. The rest of the place is stuck in 1982.Our package included breakfast in the Cocktail Lounge located next to the check-in. We rate it passable but below average with a very limited hot selection. There are other breakfast options in the hotel with more extensive buffet selections but our package did not include that option. I politely requested to exchange my breakfast coupon one morning for the Japanese breakfast coupon and that offered an interesting if equally limited diversion from the same-same of powdered scrambled eggs and bacon.Our Luxe suite package included 'lounge' access on the 34th floor. Treat it as a nice quiet sanctuary to escape the Tokyo bustle, the loud crowds in the lobby and to rest your weary feet. Don't expect a selection of high-tea treats and all-day snacks as found in better hotel 'club lounge' offerings. The food selection was extremely poor (pretzels, nuts and tired cake-bites - NOTHING ELSE). Raid the fridge for beers, wine, sodas or coffee but don't expect the food to appeal or recharge you after sightseeing.Both breakfast and lounge access use outdated paper 'coupons' and passes for entry. It is a rinky, outmoded system emblematic of the hotel's old-era operations. Check-in systems remain heavily paper based but it obviously works for them. The hotel is well located within minutes of Shinjuku railway station and the nearby nightlife. Overall, we rate the Keio Plaza Hotel 7/10. The Luxe suites were good but the rest of the place isn't compelling enough for a repeat stay. Once is enough.","Sydney, Australia","Chris H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,3.0

We used two rooms for 6 persons, and we were fairly amused to find out that the extra bed in the room wasn't like a typical folding extra bed. In fact the extra bed came under under one of the beds, and it's mattress was a full sized, and felt exactly like the other twin beds. Clean shower, which came with all amenities, and of course a fancy toilet seat (the type you'd expect all over Tokyo). The hotel also has a convenience store, restaurants (on the pricey side though), a business center (three computers and a printer), and an excellent guest relations desk - the type that can assist in getting you a bus to Disney, has bus tours, can assist in getting you tickets for the limousine bus back to the airport. Overall, a great location and a great hotel which gave us a good experience for our first stay in Tokyo.The reason I only gave a 4/5: 1) no direct hotel transfers (we had to take the limousine bus - and at least limousine bus has pick up/drop off directly at Keio Plaza Hotel lobby)2) 10 min walk from nearest train station (sometimes hard with older people in a family vacation)3) not the cheapest hotel available (sometimes I prefer cheaper hotels because I wouldn't want to be in the hotel for long - I'd rather be out exploring)","Metro Manila, Philippines","mikeyboooiii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Metro Manila, Philippines</strong>",0,4.0

Firstly we had issues on check in - we were given a twin room and not a double as requested, after a bit of time this was changed and we moved to another room. Due to room availability when we booked we had to split our booking, 3 nights in the Deluxe room and 1 (or 2 ?) in the premier room. What was the difference between the 2 rooms?? well the deluxe was actually bigger, the only other things that the premier (more expensive) offered were.....better towels, robes, and toiletries...that's it. Otherwise the deluxe was a far better room. A lot of the rooms have been renovated I think, but the condition is still a little worn - marks on walls, stains on carpets. We had paid for a full buffet breakfast and were given the vouchers for the make shift dining room to the right of the reception area...this is a lovely room predominantly I would say for people wanting to eat and check out fast, business people, it is also very uncomfortable to eat at the tables, which are small low coffee tables. This was not the restaurant that serves the full buffet breakfast, and the breakfast was very limited, and not good at all! and definitely not what we paid for. We have stayed here before and had the buffet breakfast in the main restaurant located on the below floor and it was very good. I explained to the reception that we had been given the wrong breakfast vouchers, but their attitude was basically ""bad luck"" and we were stuck with what we were given - NOT IMPRESSED. We had the buffet dinner which was very good also. All in all I actually do like this hotel, but it isn't cheap and they really need to work on their customer service, and what they offer you for the price you pay.

I didn't hear a single peep from anyone during my stay at the Keio.The bedding is amazingly comfortable and soft. Even by US standards, the room was large--by Tokyo standards, enormous. It's the only hotel in Japan where I could stand fully upright and touch my head without bumping against the ceiling (I'm 6'8""). The amenities were plentiful, and the hotel boasted a ton of restaurants (none of which I ate at--shinjuku is a 5 minute walk away).

Comfortable yukatas for adults and kids were standard issue with even kids amenities provided. We enjoyed many meals in the superb selection of F&B outlets and were really impressed by the excellent culinary offerings and impeccable service. Keio Plaza is connected to the Main Shinjuku Station via busy sheltered walkway and is just 5-10 min stroll right in the heart of Shinjuku. Across the back entrance of the hotel are streets of eateries, discount electronic Supermkt like BIC and pharmacies to stick up on Japanese beauty products. No-brained hotel for families because the Airport Limo bus stops here and most importantly it's a Disney hotel which offers direct complimentary shuttle to and from both Disneys!

The views we had were incredible, the rooms were spotless and the toilets comfortable(and western!)

In the past couple years (I know this by looking at their website and by information from my agent) they have updated the lobby VIP breakfast lounge, many of the rooms and the VIP guest lounge where you can enjoy a drink at the end of the day. The main lobby however, is still very dated and while the service is very good, it is a bit formal - no one is very quick to smile (quite different from the other places we stayed on this trip). The service was much warmer at the VIP Breakfast area and VIP Cocktail Lounge. We were fortunate that our agent had arranged for us to be checked in at the premier service desk, which allowed us to avoid the long lines of tourist groups checking in/out at the main desk.

We booked the Premiere Plaza Room which is definitely worth spending a few extra dollars on. The room was very nice and big (comparable to a 4 star hotel). It was clean, looked like the photos, and had a beautiful view. It had black out shades so you could easily sleep in, great room amenities (2 complimentary water bottles each night, complimentary tooth brushes, razors, etc.) and a bath tub. It was also great because it came with access to their Lux Lounge which has complimentary drinks and light appetizers. We loved this! The hotel staff was very friendly. We don't like doing tours and prefer exploring cities on our own and the hotel staff gave us very easy to follow directions. It is very simple to get around, as the train and subway station is within walking distance. The trains and subways are much cleaner than you see in other cities. We went to Harajuku, Shibuya, and Asakusa all very easily from our hotel location. The hotel does have several dining options, but I would recommend eating outside the hotel. We did the breakfast buffet here one day and then did the breakfast buffet the Park Hyatt another, and I thought the Park Hyatt's breakfast was much better. However, my husband did like the Japanese food selections at the buffet at Keio Plaza. There are so many great dining options near by and I recommend looking on tripadvisor to see good options in the area (we ate amazing sushi at a local spot that was walking distance).. The hotel lobby was happening, which I found to be a plus. The Park Hyatt hotel, which we also visited, while beautiful and more luxurious, was too quiet for my taste and I thought it was weird that there weren't many people in the lobby area. I also think the location of Keio Plaza is better. One negative I want to mention - our flight home was later in the day and the front desk was not willing to give a late checkout without paying extra money. Normal check out was 11am. It wasn't that they didn't have the availability, but the agent said it wasn't their policy to give late checkout without you paying. Not even 30 minutes or an hour! It wasn't a big deal, but they should consider changing this. I would recommend this hotel to anyone as long as you book the Premiere Plaza rooms.

I can walk to Shinjuku with around 5-10 minutes distance. Have convenient store and small shop around the corner.Breakfast is nice. Have around 3-4 choices of restaurants. We love Kagari which is the Japanese one. The food is quite nice and traditional Japanese.

It is definitely expensive and food is average. (I guess it gets expensive as there are a bunch of taxes and service charges they have to squeeze in, plus its a huge hotel).Anyway, At the end of our stay we discovered a convenient western breakfast spot ""Royal Host"" it's cheap and a few blocks away. Also if you go into the Keio little mall theres a food court with great reasonably priced cheap eats. Overall the hotel was convenient and the staff is nice and we had really good service.

With any review there are positives and negatives and our stay was mostly positives and I would stay at Keio Plaza Hotel again but would do a little research on the rooms before booking.This time our stay was for 7 nights, we booked a total of 5 rooms. We were able to have two double beds with a roller-away in four of the rooms, so we were able to accommodate 3 persons and even 4 in one of the rooms. The hotel rooms are been updated at the moment, so ensure you request for a recently renovated room. One family flew in earlier from Sydney, booked separately at the hotel and was given a room on the Main tower on floor 36 (they were happy with their room and had done their research to request for the Main tower and floor 36 above). The rest of the family (11) flew in later that evening and was given the South wing on floor 15. The rooms on our first night on South, floor 15 had not been updated and we were quite disappointed, the rooms felt like we were back in 2008, aircon did not even operate, so we requested better rooms which the hotel staff provided for on South, floor 23 for the remaining 6 nights. Would certainly ask for upgraded rooms whether Main or South Tower. Upgraded rooms were alot better, but tv was small surprisingly for a country known for electronics, phone and amenities were also what you would expect of a lower rated hotel. Beds and pillows firm.Never-the less, staff was very helpful from room cleaning, to concierge, bell captain to organising airport transfers. We experienced a Japanese tea ceremony at the Hotel, which was lovely, and believe the Hotel is looking at introducing more cultural events for hotel guest.Can't beat location, central to many shops, restaurants, buses and train lines, which we found easy to get around the city of Tokyo.The Hotel is a few minutes walk to convenience stores and many restaurants that opened late, so this was handy although the hotel had many restaurants to choose from.The limousine Bus drops off in front of hotel and picks up from hotel from/to Narita as well as to/from Haneda, You can also organise a direct bus to Disney Land.

I booked a room with King bed, and another room for twin beds. My booking was made about 3 months before my stay. I received an email confirming my stay, and I had no idea of the unpleasantness that would ensue at check-in.When I arrived, I was informed that my King bed booking was only a ""Request"", not a confirmation, and that I had been assigned 2 twin rooms. This was even though the rooms were held under a credit-card confirmation. Having flown 6-and a half hours, and travelling from the airport to the hotel, I would spend the next 1 hour at the front desk to get the staff there to recognise their error. I had to speak to the duty manager who was very hesitant to assign me a room of my booking. They wanted me to pay an extra fee for an ""upgrade"" room, which I refused. Finally they relented and gave me the room with the King bed. More was to come.The next day, I made (what I thought) was a simple request for an extra room key, so that my children on the other floor could easily reach my room, as the elevators are coded for the floor. Despite reasoning with them and numerous pleas, the front desk again refused. Despite speaking with the duty manager (a different one this time), he flatly refused. I have no idea, nor could they properly explain the reason why this simple request could not be fulfilled. I reasoned with them that there was no potential for a security breach, as my teenage son would be the one with the extra keycard, there was no extra cost to them as we would be returning all the keycards at checkout but they refused to budge. I cannot for the life of me understand why there is so much inflexibility here. It cost them nothing to please a guest and all they can do is say these are the rules.

The breakfast spread was fantastic.Location wise this place is fantastic, as Shinjuku JR rail is barely 200 meters away, and so is the Shinjuku market, post office and a host of other tourist attractions. We strongly recommend this place, however, you won't really get a flavour of real Tokyo since this is located more in the heart of the Business District","Tissa, India","abhaybhatia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tissa, India</strong>",16,4.0

This was a refurbished room so very comfortable and also had access to the Luxe Lounge on the 34th floor. The lounge is open from 10am to 9:30pm and offers a quiet space to work with free soft drinks/snacks all day and alcoholic drinks after 5pm. I was staying on a business trip and it was really helpful to have access to the lounge at various points during my stay to catch up on e-mails in a quiet and calm environment. I would highly recommend booking a Plaza Luxe room in order to get access to the lounge. The location is excellent - in the heart of Shinjuku with a huge array of transport connections. This is a great place to stay if you are on a business trip to Tokyo.Service was efficient and courteous throughout. I didn't eat at the hotel but there are a wide range of different restaurants which are reasonably priced for lunch but overpriced for dinner (would recommend even just walking into Shinjuku station where there are plenty of reasonably priced restaurants). WiFi is available in the rooms and the Luxe Lounge but not in the public/banquet areas of the hotel so may be worth buying a visitor data SIM card to access the internet elsewhere (try B-mobile Japan). Getting to the hotel from Shinjuku station is easy. If arriving on the Narita Express, follow signs for the ""West Exit"". As soon as you go through the JR ticket barrier, you should follow signs to the Tokyo Metropolitan Government and then you will begin to see signs for the Keio Plaza Hotel. Once you exit the station underpass, the hotel entrance is to the left. If you have luggage, it is around a 10-15 minute walk from the train platform to the hotel reception. A one-way Narita Express ticket is only 1500 JPY from Narita Airport to Shinjuku (half the price of the hotel shuttle), is the quickest way to get to the hotel and I didn't have any problems with luggage (there are lifts/escalators in Shinjuku station).There seem to be a lot of TripAdvisor reviews bemoaning hotel policies like not being able to check-in early or ""inflexibility"" or not being able to change rooms if you don't like yours. All I can say is that this rules are rules and the reason why things are so efficient and work so well in Japan is because everything runs by the book. What makes you so special that the hotel should let you check-in early or change your room if you don't like it?!Do your homework before arriving and you will be fine. You can't check-in before 2pm so if your flight arrives early into Narita, book into the Nine Hours capsule hotel for a few hours to recover before getting the Narita Express to Shinjuku (see my other review on this for details). If you don't want an old room then book a refurbished Plaza Luxe Room (they are excellent). If you need internet access outside your room then get a visitor data SIM card.

The carpets were aged and would have been impossible to clean because of their worn state. They looked very dusty. The bathroom was very small and tired.The shower was over the bath. The attachment for the overhead shower were comprised of cheapplastic. The toilet had this awful black scum which was a permanent feature even though the rooms were serviced daily. A bottle of water was not provided in the bathroom per person and as I used a bottle of water from the minibar, I was charged on checkout!

We booked our room directly with the hotel. The room was clean, spacious, we had a view of Mt Fuji (bonus) and the airport limosine bus leaves directly from this hotel. The hotel is in a good location, with many restaurants, shops and Shinduku station within easy walking distance.The ordinary: The hotel is massive and on arrival around 10:30am reception was extremely busy. We did not expect to have access to our room before 2:00pm but thought we would be able to complete the admistrative check in. This was not the case, we were asked to leave the cue and advised we could not complete check-in until 2:00pm so were required to stack our luggage with nets over them in the hotel foyer and wait until 2:00pm.The ugly: When we did complete check-in we were allocated a room in the South Tower. On stepping into the lift I noticed there was no lift security and on reaching the 18th floor the corridors smelt stuffy and old as did our room. The furniture was old, chipped and flimsy. The bed was the worst being like sleeping on a cardboard box which aggravated my sciatic nerve pain. The bathroom had a great toilet, but a shower bath. The standard was not what I would expect from a four star hotel.I was very disappointed in the standard of our room and because our friends were staying in the same hotel in the North Tower, I was able to compare the South Tower and North Tower rooms. Our room rate for the first night stay was the same as our friends who were allocated a much higher standard room in the North Tower. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends and recommend if you do stay to ask for the renovated rooms in the North Tower.","Perth, Australia","Beverley C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",1,3.0

As most of the reviews are positive about the hotel we had some high expectations. Sadly when we arrived at our room (in the Southern Tower) we noticed that the room was not as pretty as the hotel website shows on their pictures. Of course, I know that these pictures are made in their best condition, but our room felt a bit too basic. If you can imagine the cheapest IKEA furniture, you get the point. The bed felt like it was carved from rock. Maybe if you stayed a few days at a Ryokan, the bed may feel like an improvement, but I experienced better beds at cheaper hotels.As for the other facilities of the hotel. We tried breakfast once, but it's better (and cheaper) to go outside and try one the restaurants in the neighbourhood. The gym felt smaller than the superior rooms. Only if your idea of working out is walking/running on a treadmill or elliptical trainer it's decent. Is it all so bad? Well, the location of the hotel is great. It's in a perfect walking distance from Shinjuku station. Also the rooms were always clean and the free daily paper felt like a nice gesture. I wouldn't recommend the hotel to friends or family, though if they insist on staying there I would recommend them to ask for the newer rooms as they look more comfortable (and reading the reviews here, probably are).","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Stefan K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",0,3.0

We have notified you several times about this celebration. We do not expect a big hooha, but a nice ""Happy Anniversary"" card would have been appreciated or even a swan-made towels.. but no, nothing! Boo... (Incidentally, other establishments during our trip that went out of the way to make us feel special!)We arrived early at your hotel and waited patiently until it was time for check-in. We would have been happy to wait BUT for the fact that we felt that there were differential treatment in how your reception dealt with Caucasian guests as compared to Asian guests. This will be the first time I'm submitting photos to tripadvisor but I think I have to resort to doing this to you as proof. Any Asian guests were always told to wait... but there were at least 2 caucasian familes that came and had their rooms readied for them and keys given to them.... WHY?!?!?! And one of them did not even have a reservation... it was a walk-in. If I knew that walk-ins had rooms quicker, I would not have reserved a room with you guys beforehand.And after waiting and arriving at our appointed room... LO and BEHOLD, I see a raspberry on the floor.... given the Japanese culture of having high standards of hygiene, I am aghast to see that fruit on the floor. It makes me wonder now exactly how clean your room would be. Also, how come the people before us had a fruit basket but not us?!?! Is this another preferential treatment?Thank God our other Japan encounters made up for our trip.... yours was the worst!!! The only redeeming factor were your wonderful bellboys who were utterly helpful to help us with our request. The rest of your staff were courteous but curt.

At the end we used the same service to get out to the airport and this is easily bookable via a desk in the corner of the hotel lobby. Personally i prefer this to the rail options as it means you are not trying navigate the busy rail system with heavy suitcases.When we checked in the second time the hotel was very busy and seemed to be suffering from some inefficiencies in the checkin process, (the employees doing the checkin seemed to have to do quite a bit of paper work after the person checking in left the counter which seemed to slow down the process). The extra 400yen/night tax payment is rather annoying. The staff are helpful and speak good English. I would also note that it was simple to leave our main luggage with this hotel whilst we travelled around Japan and to collect it when we rechecked in later in the month. The convenience store on the second floor is useful for grabbing drinks and snacks.The deluxe rooms are nice but I question the removal of wired internet access from the rooms since our last visit. The wifi generally worked but was not as reliable as the previous wired connection (particularly for things like Skype). There was also differences in equipment between rooms, (our first room had a DVD player hooked up to the TV but the second had some form of DVD/music system (with iPod dock) which, whilst it said it supported DVDs did not actually have a HDMI cable plugged into it connected to the TV). The deluxe rooms are huge, not just by the standard of Japanese hotel rooms and are fairly quiet (although our second room was just off the elevator lobby on our floor so was slightly more noisy due to other guests). The cleaners did manage to leave a window cleaning cloth on the window sill for a couple of days during our second stay :)The hotels location in Shinjuku is good with easy access to the Shinjuku station west gate (via the tunnel accessed from the road outside the end of the second floor) and to the rest of the station and Shinjuku itself by taking the road opposite the rear of the hotel (which also has a Post Office with ATMs which work with international cards (if yours are setup with your bank to work) on it and a nice little restaurant opposite the Post Office).I expect we will stay at this hotel again in the future.","Nottingham, United Kingdom","Tim H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nottingham, United Kingdom</strong>",20,4.0

There were two chairs and a small table, the bathroom was compact and adequate with a separate dressing ante-room next to it. The view was to an office block across the road. I think a list of bathroom amenities is on the website. Only tea was included in the room so if you start the day with another beverage there is a well stocked convenience store on the lower ground.There was a range of restaurants for breakfast and we ate in the Glass Court each morning. No sign of large groups, mainly couples and small families and a few business people. It was busy but did not feel crowded. There was a large choice of food, both western and local. Not inspiring, but certainly a convenient way to start the day.We ate at the Italian restaurant the first evening and it was excellent. Both the waitress and chef were helpful in ensuring our vegetarian requirements were met.The location is excellent, close to the Shinjuko railway station. There is a bustling little area between the hotel and the station, full of restaurants (many with English menus if you ask). This area is not touristy at all. You will get lost in the station, there are several ways out, and a couple will get you back to the Hotel easily. A tip, take note of the staircase number you go down and look for that on the way out. If you do get lost, relax and go shopping. The stations are all well stocked with daily essentials, food and clothing.The last night of a trip we were given a room on the 35th Premium Plaza floor of the main building. It was gorgeous and appreciated. A huge window overlooking the bright lights, nespresso, push button everything and lots of roomI summation, I was a little nervous about staying in such a large hotel but everything was peaceful and worked well so I would stay here again.","Melbourne, Australia","Barbara102</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",82,5.0

I understand the hotel wanted to be paid with a credit card. I had secured the room with my credit card over the phone. The girls however wanted to pay in cash (Japanese Yen) They were then chastised & told it needed to be paid with a credit card. No wonder... because the amount the hotel wanted to process on my daughters mastercard debit card was for a much higher amount!!?? (The initial quote was in yen and the amount of yen they were wanting to transact was the equivalent of around $700aud more than was quoted for their 9 night stay)Please note this was for payment IN ADVANCE of their stay upon check in. So be very wary if you indeed pay with a credit card. Check the exchange rates carefully! Fortunately they refused to process this inflated amount on my daughters mastercard debit card (the type that will only work if you have sufficient funds preloaded in it.) They insisted it be paid with a regular visa or mastercard. What difference does this make??I sought help from my local Flight Centre (travel agency) & they were very helpful.They tried to talk with hotel staff in order to sort this out. (even though I had made the booking privately with the hotel & flight centre had nothing to gain from this but my gratitude) Hotel management flatly refused to negotiate & insisted on being paid with a regular credit card. So I offered to put the correct amount as quoted on my own credit card. The very same card they'd happily accepted as security for the booking in the first place. You guessed it, this too was declined. They insisted the card needed to be physically produced!So the flight centre girl generously offered to help us this way. She said if I could pay the cash to flight centre on the spot (& I was able to entertaint this option even though it was a substantially high amount - I was fortunate to have sufficient funds at my disposal.) she'd use flight centre's own company credit card to pay on our behalf. The hotel even refused this! apparently even this offer from Australia's biggest travel agency was not good enough! The hotel manager still insisted on having a physical card presented at their reception desk!Crazy. How come a credit card over the phone was sufficient to secure the room in the first place then? Eventually, hotel management relented & said they would accept cash after all - but not before the girls were extremely upset by the whole debacle and tearful at the prospect of perhaps being without a place to stay for the duration of their 9 day stay in Tokyo. I never received a satisfactory answer as to why they could not simply process my credit card of which they had details & I consented to authorize. This would have saved so much anguish.Despite being expert swimmers, these 19 & 1/2 year olds were not allowed to use the hotel pool. Too young! Seriously? Apparently you need to be at least 20 years old to swim or be with a guardian. I know about the age of accountability in Japan and yes I informed management that neither of the girls had reached the age of 20 at the time of booking directly with the hotel. I was assured this posed no problem. At least the girls saved the $23 Aud charge PER PERSON PER ENTRY to the pool charge! So let me get this straight, they can stay without a guardian but they can't swim without a guardian? Their room was supposed to have been a renovated room (yes at extra cost) Renovated when...1989??! Tired, dull & dated sums up their asigned room. At least, it was clean... which is the only reason one star is justified!",Adelaide,"silversandsAdelaide</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide</strong>",36,1.0

In our 3 visits to Japan (the others being in 2002 and 2007), Keio Plaza has always been our home away from home in some capacity. The hotel's biggest plus in my opinion is its location. It really is centrally located in the heart of Shinjuku and it's about a 5-7 minute walk to Shinjuku Station if you know where it is (it's very close to Tochomae Station as well). For this year's visit, we stayed at the hotel for 9 days - the longest we've ever stayed at this or any other hotel. In that time, we found that Keio Plaza had not changed much from our previous visits, which some could say is good, while others might say that fact is disappointing. It's true that the hotel could probably stand some renovation, but the fact remains that great customer service, hospitality, and value are more important to me and this hotel still excels at that. We stayed in a Superior, non-smoking room and I thankfully could not detect anything that suggested that someone had disobeyed this rule as some other reviews state. We also selected a package that included breakfast, which was served in the lounge near the front counter. Although the food was generally good, staying with the hotel for that long really had us yearning for some alternative offerings. Some of the offerings included eggs, cereal, bacon, scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, bread, fruit, etc. Again, the food was good, but it would have been nice to see some different items on the menu every couple of days. Speaking of food, don't overlook the fact that there is a convenience store on one of the lower levels. This is EXTREMELY convenient when you want a late night meal or snack and don't want to venture out of the hotel. I THINK it is open 24 hours, but don't quote me on that as I think the latest we went down there was close to midnight. I communicated with the staff in both English and Japanese during our visit and found that their English was quite good, but sometimes we encountered staff that would defer us to another staff member if they weren't comfortable answering something complex. They were always polite though. Keio Plaza also benefits from being the starting place for a number of tours that are run through companies, such as Sunrise Tours. It was very nice to just head to the lobby where our tour guide was waiting for tour participants rather than having to meet them at a station (which we had to do on some other tours). In conclusion, Keio Plaza remains a wonderful property and is perfect for both newcomers and experienced visitors. You can't beat the location and the price of the rooms is very reasonable (good size rooms too). If there is one negative thing to say about the hotel, it's probably that it's a good 2 hours (with traffic) from Narita Airport if you plan to take transportation such as the airport limo. Consider taking the Narita Express train instead as your arrival time into Shinjuku is at least 30 minutes faster and it's cheaper ($15 per person vs. $30). Plus, it's a straight shot from the West exit of Shinjuku Station, so it's very easy to find.","Omaha, Nebraska","DualEdge</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Omaha, Nebraska</strong>",15,4.0

The booking was made by our travel agent and i was not aware of the renovated/unrenovated rooms. Our agent booked the unrenovated standard room with twin beds... Upon learning that, i decided to email the hotel and asked if we could get the renovated room instead, they replied and said if we want an upgrade of course we need to make additional payment. I decided not to pay extra since we'll be out most of the time but instead requested for a high floor and non-smoking room in the main tower. When we arrived at the hotel, 2 ladies helped us with our luggage to our room. They are so nice and polite. Before leaving the room they greeted us Happy Wedding Anniversary. We went out and came back at night and was surprised to see a box of yummy donut-like cakes with a greeting card from the 2 ladies. I havent seen them since then and never had the chance to say thank you. So i want to give a shout out to Bell Ishioka and Ohashi, that was really thoughtful. We appreciate it.Now back to the room... though it was only a standard and unrenovated it was surprisingly clean contrary to what i read here about the unrenovated rooms. It was not really big but comfortable enough for 3 people. It has a good view of the sorroundings, Tokyo Metropolitan Building and Hyatt which are just across the street. Aircon is quiet. But poor wifi. But not a problem to us since we have portable wifi....Toilet is clean and complete with basic amenities, blow dryer etc., even have facial wash....The shuttle bus service is good going to and from the airport, disneyland and disney sea.

When you exit the station you will see a roundabout. Keep to the left, following the contour of the road. There are signs in the station showing the direction of the hotel, but once you reach the exit it's not as clear. There is a long covered walkway (similar to an underground walkway). It's a healthy 10 to 15 minute walk. The hotel will be on your left as you approach the open air.  Entering the lower floor next to the bakery go upstairs on the escalator to the large open lobby area. This is one of the nicer aspects of the hotel.  We found our room reasonably nice. It was spacious, had a good view and the beds were comfortable. The room was quiet. The decor was older and perhaps leaned a little bit toward shabby (wrinkles in the wallpaper and slightly discolored). We found the staff, the bell captain and the servers in the restaurant courteous and respectful.  If you exit directly opposite the bottom of the escalators by the cloak room there are far more choices of restaurants in the next couple of blocks. In fact, if you exit and take the road perpendicular to this side of the hotel (just to the right of the exit doors is a crosswalk), walk straight and you will almost come directly to the Odakyu Station, where you can get your free pass for a trip to Hakone. We also visited Kawagoe (an Edo era town/city) from the train station alongside the Prince Hotel, which is about 10 minutes from the Keio Plaza Hotel. Hakone is 1 1/2 hours by Romance train and I believe Kawagoe was about 45 minutes. Both worthwhile jaunts for a daytrip. Breakfast is served at a number of locations. The buffet on the lower floor is the best though a visit to the Sky restaurant for a simpler breakfast is good for the view. Your breakfast coupon will specify a location for breakfast.

Location is great, if you walk above the ground, it will takes you about 8 mins to the world's busiest station - Shinjuku. Get out of the station using the WEST exit. Mind you, Shinjuku is huge, depending on which subway line you take, you could end up exiting at different exit at the WEST exit each time.Luckily Keio Plaza is opposite Tokyo Metropolitan Building, so looking for the signboard that says ""Tokyo Metropolitan"" helps tremedously. There is an underpass linking the hotel to the Shinjuku station, we managed to use that 1 of the day, but subsequently, we didn't manage to locate this exit. But walking above the ground is better, shorter and able to enjoy the sights and the many skyscrappers in that area. The staff were very helpful and give very good advices on how to go to the places of interest.The best thing about this hotel is that they are 1 of the Good Neighbour of Disneyland, so there's a free shuttle that brings you to the resort. However, there's only 3 timing and you have to make reservation in advance. If you can, write to the hotel and make your reservation for the Disney shuttle. Having the shuttle to send us back from Disney Resort to the hotel is so good, especially after a long and fun day, just need to wait at the bus stop for the shuttle bus. Otherwise, you have to make your own way back, having to hop on the subway and transfer to different lines .There were 3 of us in the room, and we were so impressed and touched when we saw that the housemaid left 3 different colour tooth brush each day !

The train station is 3 minutes walking to which you can get the trian to anywhere and very safe at night. The bus stop is across the road.The Concierge were so helpful nothing was too much trouble the language barrier was never an issue we always managed to work through it such a pleasure to deal with everyone in this hotel. All the staff are a credit to this hotel and to themselves, be proud of yourself for making our stay so memorable.The Glass restaurant for breakfast was good, the Sky bar a good place for a pre dinner drink and the view amazing, the bakery has good pastries and the coffee lounge on the lobby level is an excellent place to relax after a long day. We also ate in the French restaurant and the Japanese on the 7th Floor both are a little pricy being in the hotel but worth it we highly recommend the food it was glorious we would eat there again.All the staff could not do enough to help us, the laundry service was fantastic and the packing of your clothes on return was way above expectation thank you.We filled in the Questionnaire as you do then thought well that will be that, a few days after we returned home we got an email from the hotel acknowledging what we had said which shows they do read them and care what we think that impressed us.We will stay in this hotel whenever we return to Japan and highly recommend to anyone staying in Tokyo to stay here, it is very central to the all the sights you would be seeing.We can't thank the staff enough for our wonderful stay.

The room was spotless every day when we returned and the housekeeping were attentive to every detail. I would recommend this hotel to anyone pay the extra for Plaza Premier room money well spent and for Tokyo prices a bargain.

And given the price, i thought it was a great deal altogether.One thing which i would have done more was perhaps to dine at the various restaurants on the way from the hotel to the Shinjuku station than at the hotel itself. While the food at the hotel's restaurant was reasonable, the prices were abit high imo. My previous stay in Tokyo was at Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku.

Also it's a big and busy hotel with 1000+ rooms so you won't experience much personal touch in the service, but staff are very efficient.My previous stays were in Plaza Premier floors in the Main Tower but this time I chose the newly renovated Plaza Luxe room in the South Tower. The rooms were comfortable and clean as usual, My only negative comment is the rather small size of the TV, but this is actually quite common in Japanese hotels.My stay package this time included breakfast at the coffee lounge on the ground floor and a dinner at the Japanese restaurant. The breakfast featured a smaller buffet than the one offered in the buffet restaurant, but I actually preferred the coffee lounge because it's much quieter and the service was more attentive.

The concierge service was adequately staffed and readily available to provide assistance. As a first time visitor to Japan, I did not like the hotel location because it seemed too far from things I wanted to do but since Tokyo is so vast, according to others the proximity to the subway is a real plus. Room service seemed excessively expensive but there is a convenience shop on the lower level with a wide range of toiletries, beverages, snacks, etc. at very reasonable and affordable prices. The hotel pool was my major disappointment. First and foremost, it is not free to guests. Coming from the U.S., my experience has always been that those staying at a hotel are always able to utilize the outdoor pool. The Keio Plaza charges an additional $20 to go to the pool, even if you just plan to sit outside. (We got the impression based upon observation that there were different prices for different people.) In any event, if you have any tattoo, you are not allowed to go out there. I understood in advance that tattoos are generally forbidden at traditional Japanese onsen or natural hot mineral baths but feel it was overly restrictive and inconvenient for a modern tourist hotel to turn away guests from an average concrete swimming pool in the middle of Summer.

I had thought I would avoid a western chain type hotel and only had 2 nights so thought this would be a good hotel. I'm also prepared to take a few risks so I caught the rapid Nex train from the airport to Shinjuku Station. It didn't look far to walk but I got lost and it was a little further than it looks. Anyway got there in the end. Lobby and look of the hotel and service was all good. I had booked a luxe room and use of the club lounge. The room was adequate but looked over a very ugly part of the city, was a bit dark and ordinary. The bathroom was fine. Going to sleep was a nightmare. The bed was hard, the pillows even harder despite asking for a softer one. The club lounge was not worth it. I decided I would check elsewhere as I wanted a good sleep. The Hyatt Regency down the road was the same price without the lounge access and I was so glad that I left. I felt much more comfortable there, the bed and pillows were great and the view out of the window was much better. I can't fault the service at Keio but I was not happy and it did spoil my view of how I experienced Tokyo especially when I only had a couple of days stopover on my way home. Next time if I come back to Tokyo I would stay in the central Tokyo district, the Nex (Narita Express) stops there first and its a nicer area if you don't have too much time, plus there is the big park which includes the Imperial Palace just close to the station.

The staff were generally able to speak English (even if it was obvious that it was a bit difficult for some of them). One guy in particular was very helpful in answering our questions about going to Disneyland, and about having our luggage sent ahead of us, but unfortunately I don't know his name so I can't give him the praise that's due to him. :( (He also spoke really good English.) The hotel can be a *little* bit tricky to find, but we managed to get there and after that, finding it again was a breeze. It's about 5 minutes' walk from Shinjuku Station, which is okay if you don't have luggage with you, but if you do then it'll feel much longer than that. Plenty of convenience stores nearby the hotel, which is useful! We arrived a few hours before check-in time and managed to get some preliminary signing-in done, but as our room wasn't ready the hotel kept our bags for us whilst we went out to explore Tokyo for a bit. When we came back several hours later, the room was ready and we found that they'd also moved our luggage into the room for us! +1 right there. The room was rather a pleasant shock - it was pretty large, much larger than I'd expected. The interior design was good; it felt very modern and also kind of soothing. The large space helped, of course. (We booked the room via the hotel's website instead of through Agoda or other channels because there was a discount for a 4-night stay that suited us just fine.)They also had a good selection of TV channels - most of the major Japanese TV channels, and also several English-language ones like CNN, BBC and Cartoon Network.","Penang Island, Malaysia","cy185</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Penang Island, Malaysia</strong>",48,4.0

In recent years they have been remodeling the rooms so right now there are new rooms with modern decor whilst the Jurassic rooms still remain. Go to the hotel web-site and investigate thoroughly before you make a decision.This time we booked a Plaza Luxe Room which is located in the South Tower (in other reviews, reviewers call it the ugly tower with elevators NOT directly behind the front desk). In fact one thing to clarify and be careful. There are remodeled rooms in the south tower whilst there are also Jurassic rooms in the main tower. So the tower is not the focus... the room type is. The Plaza Luxe rooms give the guests a nice feeling yet be careful. They have three types of bedding - King/ Queen/ Twin. We booked Queen and it was perhaps a personal mistake. I don't know. I wish I had a tape measure. I found the bed very small. Of course we expected it to be smaller than King but it just felt very small when both of us were sleeping on it.The Plaza Luxe Lounge on the south tower is a new addition to the hotel and is nice. Not a lot of food choices but pleasant enough. We had a Japanese style fresh cream cake which was good.This is also a popular hotel with constantly lots of guests and lots of events. They had some kind of a graduation dinner thing going on during our stay. The basement even has a convenience store which is indeed very convenient. Location wise, around 5-10 mins walk from Shinjuku Station West Exit or they have a complicated underground pass which leads you to a side entrance of the hotel, but we found the street walk much more pleasant than the underground pass.Given the astronomical price tags of other real 5-star international chains, I think we did get a reasonable value out of the USD200 we paid.

The location is good, although a bit boring in the bureaucratic part of Shinjuku. But it is really convenient to be next door to Shinjuku station, and it is also walking distance to Shibuya as well as to Roppongi Hills, so there is not much to complain about. There is a gym, but - as most Asian gyms - it is not great. It is far too hot inside, there is a lack of equipment, such as heavier weights, and it has no atmosphere whatever. To me that is a big minus, since I like to work out every day when I travel (and at home). On the other hand, there is a great skybar, which almost makes up for the gym...;-) And, as mentioned before, it is superconvenient to live right next to Shinjuku station! We took the train to Narita Airport, and it took us exactly 1 hour and 20 minutes from door to door (I cannot understand what some other reviewers said about the train - it takes a lot less time than the hotel limo). We also took the subway to Disneyland, since the hotel shuttle was fully booked.

Generally speaking the hotel has given the best service I have ever experienced; fresh toothbrushes, combs, slippers and razors every day.

By the second day, we kind of got the hang of it so we didn't take many wrong turns. Even then, there's still a lot of walking because the station is so big.The lobby area of the hotel is more impressive than the guest rooms.

The rooms are always good, spacious and clean and all amenities provided.This time around some set backs. Checked in early but told rooms not ready till 4pm which was way past their standard check in time.. However, we went out, came back and treid out luck at 1.30pm and found out that the 2 non smoking rooms that we had booked was full and the hotel was completely sold out and only smoking rooms were available. Knowing how bad smoking rooms can be plus personal allergies this did not go down well. Weirdly after being told the hotel was sold out....they offered us a higher room type that was non smoking for Yen 2000 per night more. Fine with me as i really could not stay in the smoking rooms.On check out (standard 11am) we asked if we could have one room till 12noon as a compensation for our original non smoking not available and having to upgrade to a higher room type. We were promptly told that we had to pay extra. To be honest, that is fair but as may be the front could have been more lenient and not so robotic. Not even did they say let me see or let me check for you etc etc.I probably would stay here again. I just hope this issue does not happen again. For the hotel to consider.....if you advertise all non smoking rooms when we make the booking, please keep that promise.","Bangkok, Thailand","Mhom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",56,4.0

We had a ‘non-renovated’ room but it was not too bad. It was reasonably big and had all the amenities. Unlike hotels in other countries, they however do not provide any body/hand lotion. The concierge desk in the lobby can provide decent assistance with directions and touring sites. It also has some very good neighbourhood map that you would want to have. They even booked show for us as we do not speak Japanese. We also signed up for the ‘executive membership’ when we booked the hotel as it was free. It entitled us to have access to the business lounge which was very good. The lounge had a good selection of drinks (including alcohol) and treats at various time of the day. Be sure to visit the washroom and watch the automated toilet does its show. Breakfast for the ‘executive member’ however was a disappointment. Japanese dishes are usually low in protein and for the breakfast in the executive area on the first floor, there was hardly anything worth eating, more like a continental breakfast. We did not try the buffet breakfast so we cannot comment on it. The hotel is centrally located with great shopping facilities close by and the subway station about 5-minute walk away. Go to the Keio department store at around 6 pm and down to the food floor. It is jam packed with shoppers buying ready-to-eat food to take home around that time. They provide food samples very much like some of the grocery stores here in North American, allowing you to taste various dishes. Some of them are really nice. The prices of many food items also drop by 20 to 50% after the crowd is gone and one can easily buy lots of food, heat it up with the microwave on site and take it back to the hotel room. There are however, plenty of restaurants between the hotel and Keio department store where the subway system is located, so food is never an issue. Similarly, many of the bakeries in the shopping mall underneath the department store also have their baked products on sale in the early evening before closing. You can easily satisfy your carbohydrate rush that way. Another thing one has to watch out for is foreign exchange. Unlike other hotels, this one does not provide currency exchange service. There are currency machines on site that provides rates not too bad as compared to currency exchange stores that can be found close by. Forget about banks for currency exchange as all of them around the hotel only have banking machines with no teller service. The only one with teller service does not provide currency exchange.","Edmonton, Canada","NMJK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",46,4.0

It is well used by westerners and Japanese alike.

The staff are plentiful on Reception, Concierge and in the various restaurants and obsequiously polite and respectful at all times - wish the UK was like this. Nothing was ever too much trouble and there seemed to be an established and well-oiled procedure mapped out for every eventuality from check-in through to limousine shuttle back to Narita airport. Nothing seemed to have been left to chance. I guess if you like laid back spontaneity you'd find KPH a bit regimented. But for an ex-military type who admires respect, hierarchy, good order and procedural efficiency this hotel is as good as they come. Also very close to Shinjuku Metro/Bus/Train station (5 Mins walk). I happen to have been here on business but would readily return to the same hotel as a tourist. My only grip is that since this hotel is based on twin towers with 20+ floors each, stairs are not an option which can mean a slow route to and from breakfast at peak times.","Grantham, United Kingdom","JonathanV181</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grantham, United Kingdom</strong>",101,5.0

So it's easy to get everywhere from there. Also, it's about a 10-12 minute walk through Shinjuku station to the shopping and nightlife side of Shinjuku (including thde Golden Gai area and Shinjuku Park. Do not underestimate, however, the size and scale of Shinjuku station. It is enormous and incredibly busy. Hotels in Tokyo are expensive, but relatively speaking, we thought this one was reasonable based on the standard of the hotel and the location. I would describe it as a really good 4 star hotel. I would recommend it as a good base in Tokyo. We were in Tokyo meeting friends who stayed in Ginza and in Asakasa and to be honest, we all spent most of our non-sightseeing time around Shinjuku and Shibuya so I think our hotel location was better than theirs. We did not eat in any of the restaurants so I can't comment on those.Local tip - If you're feeling a little adventurous, head to Omoide-Yokocho which is on the West side of Shinjuku Station opposite the huge Uniqlo and Odakya Bic Camera stores.

We arrived very early in the morning and caught the Airport Limousine bus to the hotel. This turned out to be a very simple process and I'm glad we didn't choose to attempt the Tokyo train system with our luggage after a long flight. The Airport Limousine dropped us at the door and cost around $30.The room had amazing views across Tokyo, and was very comfortable. All modern conveniences were installed such as wifi, electric blinds and of course the luxury Japanese electronic toilet. The bathroom was quite large but was a pre fabricated room so it didn't share the luxurious feel that the rest of the hotel conveyed. It came equipped with L'Occitane products, hairbrush, toothbrushes, toothpaste and big, fluffy towels.During our stay we visited the bakery downstairs on numerous occasions, picking up well priced snacks. We also spent one night enjoying the Yamanami Teppan-yaki restaurant, if you have the time to do this I would highly recommend you do, while it was pricey the food was delicious and having your own personal chef preparing it in front of your eyes was incredible. We also ate an American style buffet breakfast downstairs, this was nice but a little odd being served poached eggs on crispbread. We spent another amazing evening at the Polestar Bar. The views from the Polestar Bar are just beautiful, especially at night. On the night we were in the bar a big thunderstorm rolled across the city and it was amazing watching it roll in and then fade away from our seats at the bar. The bar had a huge range of drinks, my husband enjoyed a few glasses of Whisky and I sampled some of the cocktails.Location-wise the hotel is very close to Shinjuku Station, this made sightseeing very easy. The station was enormous and it did take quite some time for us to find our way in and out at the right exits. An express train was available to Tokyo station which took about 15 minutes.In all a wonderful stay. I would definitely stay at Keio Plaza again in the future and would recommend it to my friends without hesitation.","Geelong, Victoria AUSTRALIA","Blackwater165</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geelong, Victoria AUSTRALIA</strong>",162,5.0

When I first walke in, I almost couldn't believe I was in a hotel in Japan. The bed was very comfortable, one of my best sleep in hotels. The only downside was in the breakfast restaurants. I went to both of their breakfast restaurants for my 2 nights stay, and the same thing happened in both places. 'Cuz I was alone, so when I left my table to get more food or tea, the staff assumed I had finished so went on and clear my table. (I made sure the ""reservation card"" on the table stands. As I was told, this in Japan shows that someone is/will be using the table). When this happend the first time, I was nearly full so I just left. But the next morning in their western style breakfast restaurant, it happened again not long after I got in( there was a long queue). I put the food I picked on my table and went to get some tea. In this less than a minute time, my table was cleaned again! I felt bad about all those un-touched food being wasted, even though the waitress, after she knew I was just away to get a cup of tea, helped me get almost exactly the same thing I had on my plate again. The impacable Japanese way of service. With her quite limited English, it sounds like it was the floor manager who directed her to do that. I don't know if they just tried to make the table turning go faster since there was a queue.

It’s a five minute walk from the Hotel's west exit to the Shinjuku station. The Observatory building is just across the road. There are also many restaurants and eating places within walking distance from the hotel.

There are many restaurants on the premises, although we didn't visit any of them since we were in a huge international City with many awesome restaurants in it. I read the guy's review who noted the long check-in time and aged room.... My wife and I got lucky and checked in quickly, however every other time I was in the lobby, it was packed with a long disneyland-style line of people trying to conduct business at the front desk. We got lucky but not everyone does, apparently. We had specifically booked a renovated room and when we showed up we were initially led to a non-renovated room. The manager was able to correct the problem quickly and upgrade us, but WOW, what a difference. Our renovated room was beautiful, clean, modern, and filled with great amenities. We loved it and enjoyed our stay. The non-renovated room should have gone through two rounds of upgrades before it got to that point. It had marked walls, a terrible bed, a comical clock/radio, used slippers, no safe, no complimentary water, and the hallway had extremely dated carpet that was stained and depressing. The bathroom was upgraded and looked new. The used slippers and different amenities in the non-renovated room confirms Art9999's review that those rooms must be pretty much ignored.There is a nice gym with several cardio machines and weights. Our experiences with staff at the hotel were all positive, although I had an interesting conversation with someone at the front desk before we got there. Our flight was delayed and we missed our arranged shuttle from the airport, so I called to notify the hotel we'd be late and ask what I should do regarding transportation. The guy I talked to said we'd be fine checking in late but he didn't know about transportation, they don't deal with that. I was little confused by that reply and ended up laughing it off, but GEEZ! The ""not my problem"" answer is uncommon in from hotels in my experience. The trains in Japan are very good and we were able to figure it out, no big deal. I'm sure hundreds of people a day travel to Keio Plaza from Haneda/Narita... maybe I can help them out and put together a train route or list of shuttles so that they can be more helpful and less helpless if someone asks how to get to their hotel. Maybe it was a language barrier. Maybe I've just gotten lucky in the past with consistently extra-ordinarily helpful hotel staff? hahaMy review and rating is based on our pleasant experience with a new room and swift service, but beware if you don't request/pay for the nicer upgraded room or if you don't feel comfortable with public transportation. My wife and I had a lovely stay in a fabulous room and had kind service by the front desk, manager, concierge, and bell staff.

However, it was memorable in that it wasn't memorable at all-- just average.This hotel looks huge, impersonal and corporate... And the lobby is austere and flavorless. If you're looking for the quintessential Japanese experience, look elsewhere (a smaller hotel maybe). The rooms seem in good working order and are more spacious than some other double-bed-size rooms we've stayed in in Tokyo (we stayed in the renovated tower), but decoration isn't much to look at and the bathrooms aren't notable in any way. Two bottles of water are left in the room a day and cleaning seems good and thorough.Hotel staff is very kind (meets expectations) and location is good: Steps to Shinjuku Station and some fun areas. There's a DVD player in the room which actually turned out to be helpful. The money exchanging at the hotel is a HUGE rip-off, however, and not at all what I would expect from a ""luxury"" hotel. Other hotels would allow you to exchange at the desk and would give you a good rate. Here, they make you use an impersonal machine which skims off 7 or 8% all together.

It was natural that I would looked at Keio Plaza as I had a pleasant stay here last time. We booked a 3 night stay starting 14 Feb (Today) to 17 Feb 2014. Arriving here to check in we were faced with a huge crowd at the check in counter. It took almost an hour for us to check in to our room. I booked a No Smoking Deluxe Room with a King size bed. The room we got was rather ""aged"" and not particularly well maintained. Furthermore, the room we got was a Smoking Room with Twin beds. We guessed that it may have been a mistake since the check in staff were very busy. Trying to be understanding despite our hour long wait to check in, we were treated quite unprofessionally when we called Front Desk to request to change our room to match what we booked. The staff who we spoke to just made us feel that he didn't want be 'disturbed', so we requested to speak his manager. Lo and behold, we were already speaking to the manager, or he may have just informed us he was the manager. Being a manager may bring a lot of responsibilities, but surely, customer service and ensuring a positive experience for the guests, should be pretty high on his priorities. We asked to come down to speak to him. He just said nothing is going to change, there's nothing he could do, the hotel is fully booked, making sure to let us know with his tone that we were a bother and he is not willing to do anything. Determined not to let the incompetency and 'don't give a cr_p' attitude of the manager ruined our holidays, we decided to move the 2 beds together into a single large bed. We found rubbish behind and under bed side table between the twin beds, specifically, it was some plaster wrapper or sanitary napkin wrapper. Under the bed nearest the window, there was more uncollected garbage, this time it looked like a sugar sachet or something. We took some photos and will try to upload them after this review. In conclusion, despite the ideal location and spacious interior, the hotel is ruined by an incompetent manager who just didn't bother to even try to be nice, let alone, please a returned guest. Not only did he failed in his guest relation duties, the uncollected garbage we found speaks for his failing to manage his housekeeping staff. Running a hotel is a big responsibility, and if this is just too much, other career choices may be wiser for both the guests' and the manager's peace of mind.","Bangkok, Thailand","Art9999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",10,1.0

I found it somewhat cold and emotionless, very touristy, busy and lost in terms of brand identity. Check in was busy and took a while to do. Every time I went past the reception it was busy. Service was very good. Everyone was very happy to help even if English was a barrier. I really should have learnt some key Japanese words before I visited. I was on the 31st floor in a Plaza Luxe suite. Whilst the view was ok it was not amazing though the sunrise was lovely. My room was fine, not as good as other 'luxe' rooms I've stayed in at other hotels of which I've stayed at many. There was a small closet space and a bathroom that you could barley, comfortably dry yourself in without the door closing on you or you banging into the hi-tech toilet. The interior was fine, very clean, quite corporate mixing oatmeal and dark wood throughout. The iron that they kindly loaned me free of charge (organized efficiently by email pre my stay) was bizarre. It was like something you charge and then use?! Not that good at pressing either but was ok when used a few times. The good things were the water pressure of the shower that was so intense it felt great. You felt instantly clean and awake. The complimentary 2 water bottles were very much welcomed. Teas and coffees are ok but nothing special but the mini bar was quite empty. No snacks?! Room cleaning was great. The robes (too small) and towels were a tad scratchy but the array of them was useful. The hair dryer was good and there were plenty of all those little bathroom accompaniments such as hair brush, ear buds etc etc. The hotel has a few small shops within it and many restaurants. Book if you wanna use them as they have limited space. I would recommend you try the lobby bar and the main tower top bar called Polestar to drink in. But avoid eating, I found the food was disappointing, I even went plain and tried a club sandwich that was tasteless. Polestar has a wonderful view of the city, nicely lit ambience, serves good drinks too, plus you can smoke in there but I won't even get started on smoking in Japan as it's all quite strange and confusing. Its the hotels gym facility I was most disappointed in. The hotel is enormous so you'd think they'd have a gym that reflected the potential number of users. The gym is two very, very small rooms, equipped with a few running machines, 2 cross trainers, a small rack of weights, a bench, chest press and leg press. It's reasonably ok for a very small workout but a full body work out was difficult for me especially underneath the dreadful office strip lighting!! It's hideously decorated and generally unloved. WARNING: Don't lunge on the floor mats as they are not stuck to the floor and quickly slip from under you. There is a water machine and small towels provided but don't forget to sign the disclaimer!?! Breakfast was ok. I think our room level/type reflected the quality of the breakfast we got. I say this because others who attended the same work event as us had rooms on lower levels of the hotel and received a different standard of breakfast in a totally different breakfast room, not like ours. The breakfast we had was pretty standard of an average to good hotel. The usual plethora of cereal, juice, fruit, yoghurt and pastries were on offer and were ok quality. The cooked stuff looked processed to me, sausages, bacon and mass produced scrambled egg are not my thing. The breakfast room is the same as the evening lobby bar so very nice and relaxing to sit in. The last day of our visit this breakfast room was closed so we were asked to use the downstairs breakfast room. Wow what a change. In total contrast to the plush lobby room and it's wide selection of food, this was a drab looking, utterly grim canteen. The selection was super limited and the quality much, much lower than before. The 3 cereals looked like dust and I've never seen french fries served for breakfast. There was a table display of grey vegetables. Appetising? Avoid. It was very unpleasant. Would I recommend the hotel? Not really unless your working in the area. It's well located, close to the main station, very near to the place I was working and it was short walk over to a few drinking and eating areas so this was great. I managed to use the tube and that was super efficient and everything felt quite close by with the varying express services. I also took a taxi to the designer shopping district and that only took 15 minutes, so not bad at all. In short, the Keio Plaza needs to fine tune some aspects. It's big enough to have a great gym. It's expensive enough to serve a great breakfast. Rooms should have quality robes and decent pressing equipment or discounted pressing services, plus more hangers for long staying guests. It's the little things that I feel it lacks but it's these can really make the difference between being average and excellent. For the price you can get better elsewhere.

In terms of proximity, I rate this higher than places like the Century Southern Tower and Shinjuku Hyatt which I have stayed at and of comparable standard.

The hotel in itself is just huge with 2 towers and multiple restaurants. The rooms are also fairly big in Japan standard as well. The room at the Main Tower is renovated whilst the one in the South Tower is slightly older (looks like those from the 80s).

Although the rooms had most of the elements you would expect from a luxury hotel in regards to toiletries, service etc they are quite old fashioned and outdated. The bathroom and toilet are combined which was challenging at times with two teenager girls and two adults to share. It was also very small but did feature a heated western toilet which was quite a highlight during the cold nights that we were visiting. My major complaint from our stay at Keio was the beds and the Manchester. The beds themselves were extremely hard and the linen matched equally. To the point that I found myself tossing and turning most of the night and waking up sore from a night of slumber. Everyone else in the family did the same and because of the stiffness of the sheets this was noted by everyone during the night.

Our room was spacious as well as the bathrooms not comparable to the hotels we stayed in Osaka and Kyoto. A free wifi was provided in the room, the restaurants in the basement were good enough, a convenient store too, the hotel has openings in all four sides making it convenient for hotel guest to go in from what ever direction you're are coming from, north south east west.

I had emailed the hotel about our late arrival (around 11pm or later) and about our wifi delivery as well as requesting the shuttle to Disney. Email correspondence was VERY easy with the hotel. If you are going to Disney, email them about 30 days before to book the shuttle, they will drop you off and bring you back to the hotel, for FREE. The Premier room was wonderful, we were in a large room on the 39th floor with a good view. Amenities are nice in a Premier room, PJ's, slippers, robes, high end soaps, lovely tea cups, FREE WIFI!, a great bed, a safe, to name just a few of the niceties provided. South Tower (which costs me more because I missed a sale by booking too late), was OK (Noisy, I could hear lots of noise from adjoining rooms unlike the Premier which must be soundproof). We had the same view just 20 floors lower so looked directly into a building next door. Bed was not as nice, and of course the amenities were of a much lower class, and we had a safe as well. We had a WiFI delivered from Global Communications and at check in, they said I had no packages. I was certain I should have, but told them I would contact Global. About 5 minutes after we were in our room the phone rang, and sure enough, they found the package. We used the Limousine bus to get from Narita to Keio, since our arrival was so late at night. But the hotel is fairly easy to find from Shinjuku station, just follow to the West Exit towards the Tokyo Government building and you'll find it. We didn't eat in any of the restaurants. We tried to eat at the buffet, the Golden Corral, we walked up and they invited us in and said there was no menu, it was buffet. They asked us to take a look which we did, it looked OK, but when I showed the host we had a 10% coupon, he told us it was reservation only! The buffet was about $35 per person, so I guess the savings of $3.50 meant more to them than my business. If you do stay at this hotel I recommend you join IPrefer rewards and book EARLY to get a good rate in the Premier Deluxe rooms.","Los Angeles, California","CrystalSorrows</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",74,3.0

The first plus is that it is on the route of the Friendly Bus Limo Service which deposits you to the hotels doorstep.

Its a hugh hotel with 2 towers called Main and South Block. The main block has been refurbished but the room was decididly smaller that the South Block where we stayed on our return from Kyoto. South block is ,however, in need of an upgrade but still clean and comfortable due to the size. So if you have lots of luggage stay in the South.Many interesting restaurants in the hotel but a tad expensive. Better to walk out and eat you can also experience Shinjuku area with all its atmosphere and activity.No security safes in the room but a efficiently run round-the clock safe deposit center at the reception.Please do feel free to buy from the convenience store...its well stocked and not any more expensive than the stores on the road.The japanese people are the politest race i have met in all my travels.

Pushing my Mom on her portable transport chair around the vicinity was convenient, although there will be times when you have to walk a little further for ADA accessible ramps = more exercise for you! Staff was friendly, courteous and professional. The hotel is very large with lots of high-end priced restaurants below ground. We preferred eating outside walking distance from the hotel with the locals. The subway station's various wings have tons of eateries to choose from, as well. There are also some coffee shops just outside of the hotel where you can get very good hot breakfast sandwiches and coffee that is of European standard. There are 2 large malls several blocks away. Our hotel room was high enough to witness one of the most spectacular sunrise for which Japan is known for. There were 3 of us, so the room had 3 slightly larger/wider than twin sized beds.

The hotel was built in the 1980's however you wouldn't notice with the impressively huge building and the large lobby. I've read many reviews on TA and upon check in, I made sure we were in a renovated room. We were on the 25th floor and my husband and I found that the room was spacious compared to many other Tokyo hotels. The bathroom was okay, a little on the small size and feels a bit old. We found many stains throughout the room on the carpet and on the cushions however housekeeping did a good job making sure it was clean. There was an in-room safe, kettle, a travel adapter (if you forgot yours) and a mini refrigerator which was great however the mini fridge didn't close properly so our food/drinks was not cold. The hotel is situated near many restaurants but be forewarned tourists aren't as welcomed as you think and language barrier can be an issue. This hotel is situated on the west side of Shinjuku so its quieter and we always felt safe, there was a Lawsons and 7-11 about 5 minutes away from the hotel. There was so much to see/do/explore and this hotel was great for that since you have to walk everywhere (be prepared to walk!). Concierge was also great as they offer free umbrellas when its raining. Pros: 1. The room is pretty spacious compared to many other Tokyo hotels 2. This hotel is a Disneyland good neighbour hotel which offers free shuttle to Disneyland and/or Disneysea which we took advantage of 3. Close to many restaurants 4. Next to a covered walkway which leads to Shinjuku station 4. Staff spoke decent english 5. Airport limousine drop-off/pick-up right in front of hotel 6. There's an in-room safe which a lot of other hotels are not availableCons: 1. Needs a renovation 2. Bathroom was a bit small and dated 3. There are many exits from this hotel so it can be confusing 4. The mini refrigerator didn't close properly so our drinks/food wasn't coldTIP: We landed at the Nartia airport, we took the airport limousine and with traffic it took us 2 hours to reach our hotel.

I like to stay at 2-3 different hotels in Tokyo depending on the purpose of my stay. When I am in Tokyo with a group of MBA students, a large hotel with several restaurants within the hotel or nearby and easy access to/from train and subway stations is needed. This large hotel is in Shinjuku with a vibrant night life, within a few minutes walking distance from the Shinjuku train station. Nearby there is a Starbucks. Also, there is a post office with ATM machines to withdraw cash which is almost always the cheapest way to purchase Yen (let your bank know you will be using the ATM card in Japan, just like you do with your credit card issuing banks). Keio Plaza has two towers; depending on the floor, rooms can be very large and recently renovated. There is a small fitness center with two treadmills from the past century but they get the job done. On the same 7th floor of the main tower, there are several restaurants; one of them is a branch of Kyubey, a great sushi bar. There is a convenience store at the basement of the hotel. There are too many restaurants to list them all here. There are two bars at the top with excellent views. In addition, you are within walking distance to Park Hyatt which has the New York Bar (featured in the Lost in Translation) with even better views and live jazz music every evening. You will be far away from the financial center of the town (Marinouchi, Nihombashi, east of the Imperial Palace in general) so if that is your objective then it makes sense to stay in that area. If not, Keio Plaza is a very nice option.","West Hollywood, California","Selo_I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Hollywood, California</strong>",14,4.0

The Keio was the first hotel I ever stayed at in Asia, about fourteen years ago and I remember being really impressed by it. Of course I was at the start of fourteen years of hotel stays in Asia and Europe and perhaps more easily impressed. I had a four night stay in Tokyo last week and was booked for all four nights at the Keio. The place now has the feeling of a dinosaur. It reminded me a lot of the Waldorf Astoria in New York. Formerly great, but now it's just tired, a little bloated and very, very run down. When I walked into my room in the South Tower, I had that immediate sinking feeling that this was not going to go well. Just looking at the state of the carpet - stained, uncleaned, worn - and the walls in the entryway - scuffed, worn wallpaper - was enough to convince me that this was a bad bet. That was before I got to the basically undecorated, scruffy room with furnishings from the 1980s, a bed that was as lumpy as it was solid, and the final insult; the bloodstain on the bathroom wall. I kid you not. And all this for the one low price of between $150 and $350 per night (sliding scale based on the fact that it was a holiday weekend). I stayed one night due to tiredness, slept not a single moment on the most uncomfortable bed in the world, used the - it must be said adequate - gym in the morning and checked out. I moved to the ANA Intercontinental in Roppongi for the remaining three nights, which was a much better bet. Very poor, Keio.

From the outside, the hotel is impressive but the rooms are small and the furniture and bathrooms are extremely dated. Having spent the preceding days in a Kempenski property in Beijing, the difference in decor was dramatic and depressing. The furniture is straight out of the 70s and in need of an immediate upgrade. The room is small and, for a king-sized room, the desk is oddly positioned in the middle of the floor instead of against the window or wall (we quickly rectified this by rearranging the furniture - I'm sure this happens quite a lot). But the hotel rooms were clean and well attended, the bed was comfortable and the front desk staff was friendly and helpful. Although outdated and looking a little worse for wear, the chair in the room was a recliner which was very comfortable on the rare occasion we were in the room. Our room rate included breakfast which is offered at one of three restaurants; our favorite offering both the Asian and Western breakfast options was very good. There are many restaurant options inside the hotel itself, all that are much more expensive than exterior restaurants just steps away but convenient with great service.

However, I would not recommend staying here for the following reasons:- This is a very large, and therefore impersonal, hotel. Be prepared for large conference groups who will occupy most of the staff's time/attention.- Hotel is rundown. The two nicest places are the lobby and the Luxe Lounge on the 34th Floor in the South Tower. Elsewhere, expect dirty carpets, peeling paint/wallpaper, and other signs of wear and tear.- For the most part, staff do not speak English (concierge and some reception staff are the exception). This is especially true at the restaurants. It seems that they are catering for local tourists and businesspeople more than foreigners.- Housekeeping was hit or miss. One day they left my half-eaten food tray from the night before. - Customer service is not their forte. For example, they would not allow us into the restaurants for breakfast unless we had a meal coupon (some of us had already eaten and just wanted to join our coworkers afterwards - it shouldn't have mattered since it was open buffet anyway).- Food itself was edible but not great. Would definitely recommend eating out rather than at one of the many hotel restaurants.- Fitness room had nice machines but no air conditioning.- Use of the pool incurs an extra fee even for hotel guests (I didn't use it so cannot comment beyond this).On the plus side, we had a 3-day executive meeting and the service was impeccable. And the convenience store in the basement is open until 2:30am - much appreciated :-)I would definitely try another hotel next time I am in Tokyo, and recommend that my company explore other options as well.","Hong Kong, China","LaPortuguesa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",40,2.0

I've stayed at hotels all over Asia and little in Europe half the price and 3x the price.I've arrived at the above opinion 1 day into my 3 day stay, it was THAT good and it only got better even after I checked-out!Upon arrive we were notified the grade of our room was full and was upgraded without hesitation. I'm constantly surprised how many hotel try to hesitate on this obviously only thing to do.The term ""Hotel"" in Japan means a different thing than in the West, and I can assure you no matter where you come from this hotel will not be considered ""small"" like others in Japan. This is a proper Western sized hotel.We got a huge room with a large queen bed with wall to wall floor to ceiling window view of the whole Shinjuku district, to get a better view you probably have to go to the Shinjuku Gov building's observation floor.I could go into infinity details, but I will just say, the Japanese are really into details. In a totally anal sense, and the room was prepared and equipped to the best of their abilities. There are things and service in the room that you wouldn't think of needing, because they've thought about everything. For those of you backpackers who think you just need a room, you need to find something 1/2 of this price or else you are not getting good value. For those traveling with family like me, we need service! Like letting our 8yr old stay in the room without extra charge. Having a convenience store in the hotel. Airport shuttle at the lobby. Bath products that will make all the ladies scream. Close but not in the middle of it all in Shinjuku so we can have a relaxing stay, but also a covered conveyor belt walk way into the metro station, that make a huge difference during the rain!The whole service got even better after we checked out. I accidently left 2 expensive polo shirts and worse of all a stack of cash and only set of car keys in the room. I didn't realized this until I've returned to my home country's airport. After contacting housekeeping, they mailed all my things NEXT DAY without asking for shipping payment upfront! YES EVEN THE STACK OF CASH I left!Absolutely the best experience I had anywhere in the world even compare to the famous W, FOUR SEASONS, Sherton, and Westin!If you got the budget for Keio, go for it!

Maybe classical old school if there exists such an old school. The kind of old school who talks about 10-hour flights from the West Coast to Hawaii, quotes Cary Grant, and knows a Benny Goodman tune about 20 seconds after the first instrument plays. But the way his face lit up when we arrived told me that I had made the right selection when it came to where we staying for the week. The Keio Plaza is about a 15 minute walk from Shinjuku Station and has everything one needs while staying in Tokyo. There is a nice selection of restaurants, English-speaking staff, various gift shops, Free in-room WIFI- which I did not encounter any problems with, a great bar on the 45th floor to unwind after those long adventurous days, and of course the convenience store on the lower level. The latter of which is a great place to pick up something to enjoy the sunrise with from your room's window. Staff were also very helpful when my coworker locked himself out of the room three times. After the second time, they had his room key already made out at the deskThroughout our week in Tokyo, the Keio Plaza wasn't only our hotel but our haven from the bustling city. We got into the routine of waking up early, heading out into the city, returning to nap, and then I would venture out again while my coworker slept. Shinjuku has a nice park not too far from the hotel. There are also a lot of great shops and restaurants to look for souvenirs, experience new foods, or just stroll around and admire not how different we are from one another but how similiar we each are to each other. At the end of our trip, I made my way to Haneda Airport and elsewhere in Asia while my coworker went to Narita Airport. The Limo Bus for both airport stops directly in front of the hotel so it is very convenient.If you have not decided where to stay yet, I highly suggest the Keio Plaza. It is great for anyone visiting Tokyo to make money, see things, or create memories to talk about during coffee breaks not with a coworker but with a once-in-a-lifetime friend.","San Francisco, California","Michael L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",35,4.0

We were on a high floor with a view of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, a landmark in itself (don't miss their free observatories!) and excellent views of Shinjuku. The room was huge and comfortable. I loved the mattress! There were bathrobes and cotton yukatas, as well as two types of slippers. There was a mini bar and an expresso machine as well as a water boiler. Free bottled water was offered daily. The toiletries were high quality (L'Occitane) and there were other amenities in the bathroom such as hair brush and even hair bands! I had never seen that before. The wi-fi was hit or miss when trying to connect with the phone but with the laptop it worked fine. The hotel is easily accesible from the Shinjuku station walkway, just follow the directions to the Metropolitan Government Building. My only complaint was with the cleaning service. Even though they clean rooms until 3 pm, every day at noon we would get a note under the door saying they had been unable to clean the room due to the ""do not disturb"" button so we had to call room service to let them know they could clean the room. Other than that I absolutely loved the hotel and would go back in a heartbeat.","Atlanta, Georgia","Piolina</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",151,5.0

I stayed here twice only bcoz of it's location. Its a huge hotel compared to many others in Tokyo. So, expect it to be very crowded and annoyingly noisy. On the floors that I've stayed, there were over 30 rooms on each floor. So, expect the hallways to be very noisy 24 hrs a day. Not to mention noises from other rooms too bcoz of its very poor sound proof structure. This is definitely not the hotel for you if you're expecting to have a quiet and relaxing holiday. Or even a business trip if you don't really need to be exactly at it's location. There are many better hotels nearby or just a few blocks away. As for the rooms, the nightmare starts with the temperature of the rooms. The controls in the rooms are actually only for decorating purpose only bcoz even if you set the temp. to 18c, it stays at 25-28•c... It gets so HOT not warm and you can even sweat in your sleep. Good for the cold winter and for people who are trying to lose some excess fat by sweating a lot(kidding).The beds are sub-standard and not a bit comfortable. Its actually worst than those in the cheap motels. The bathroom is as usual, very small as with all the hotels in Japan. The rooms smell like hell as they allow guests to smoke even in non-smoking rooms. The first few rooms they gave me actually smelled like ashtrays until They change them after my consistent complains... Buy they'd actially insist that the rooms are non-smoking. The size of the rooms are fairly big but the room rates justify the size..And BEWARE of the change of rates if you would need to extend your stay for a day or two.... they'll literary rob you by raising the room rates for 30 to as much as 200%.

We enjoyed it, but must note that much of our enjoyment may have hinged on a room upgrade that we received at check-in. We booked a ""Biz"" room, but were upgraded to a ""Premium"" room on a mid-30s floor. The Premium room, which looked to have been recently remodeled, was fantastic. Huge, by Tokyo standards. Great views. Nice furnishings. A couple of other nice touches: First, a business center with free printing and at least one computer left on an English-language setting. I know, a business center seems pretty mundane, but not all the hotels we stayed at in Japan had one. Second, on the ground floor there's a convenience store that's open late. Although the shops of Shinjuku aren't far away (among them, a 7-11 is about two blocks east of the hotel), it was nice to have a source of Cokes, etc., so close by. Finally, although it's pretty easy to get to the subway via surface roads, the hotel also connects to a tunnel that goes straight to the Shinjuku hub. Some minor critiques: The fitness center is pretty small, has no free weights over 20 lbs or so, and is mostly geared toward cardio exercise. The pool was closed, and it was mid-May and pretty warm out. The hotel gets lots of tour groups, so the lobby is probably going to be pretty crowded during your stay, at least much of the time. Finally, although the hotel is very close to the sights and sounds of Shinjuku, which are pretty awesome at night, it's a ways from Harajuku and other tourist destinations in Tokyo. So, overall, we would definitely stay again if guaranteed an upgrade to the room class we occupied. Otherwise, we probably would stay again, but might try something a little closer to downtown.","Portola Valley, California","hc_ranger</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portola Valley, California</strong>",25,5.0

The Keio Plaza Hotel Shinjuku was an amazing hotel to stay at. I'm not a big traveller, but Japan was my dream holiday and I wanted some good hotels, and the Keio Plaza was as good I could have hoped for. Of course, all people are different, so no experience is the same, but I highly recommend this hotel if you're staying in Tokyo for a few nights! Here are some of my top highlights:1. External services around the hotel. They are amazing! It is literally a 3 minute walk to the Shinjuku Station, which will take you everywhere you want to go (but be careful of rush hour!). There is also hotel drop off service available, and they will organise to take you back to the airport if needed. I didn't go to Disneyland, but I know there were pick-up services right from the hotel for it, so that would be handy for holiday-ers.2. Hotel Services. Incredible! The staff were all friendly, helpful and spoke beautiful english. We had a very nice boy bring our heavy luggage up to our room for us, and the man who served us at the desk was friendly, quick and got us through quick. Check out was even more simple. Just hand over the keys and go! If you're looking for tours - got straight to JTB, they are the no. 1 specialists! There is even a dedicated meeting point in the middle of the hotel with a big sign you can't miss when you check in.3. Rooms/Room Cleaning. The rooms were a typical western design for a rather classy hotel. They were beautifully clean and neat, and the room amenities were all rather helpful. The cleaning services are very good - they even repacked our shampoos for us. Although we did notice at the end of our trip they had eaten some of the lollies my friend had had sitting out. We didn't mind - we though it more cute then annoying! And yes - the toilets are the weird Japan-tech design with the 'butt-washer'. Watch out when you sit down because water automatically sprays into the toilet (and kinda on to you) rather loudly and it scared the crap out of me (nearly literally ;P)! Oh yes, and the view - I was worried I'd get a crap view, but I had nothing to worry about! Our view looked over towards Shinjuku Station and we got an amazing view of the Tokyo Nightlife - we even had a direct view of Tokyo Skytree!!4. Shops. We didn't buy anything for shopping there or restaurants, but we did go to the convenience store for milk and snacks. The store was packed with all sort of things and had everything we needed. There was even a dedicated section to Hello Kitty! (Who I love!!). If you're looking for milk for breakky you may have brought over - the brand is 'Meiji' and you can get it in a carton for 140 yen!Now, some of the downers of the hotel (noticed only 4/5 points?)1. Interent. I'm a technological teen (a.k.a I am a wuss and needed to Skype my mother), and I sort of need a little dose of internet to survive. Unfortunately - I got no internet anywhere in Tokyo. This was a little disappointing as it is such an advanced city, I was hoping to score some - but alas I didn't. I do know other people in the hotel got it fine, so either it was just my bad luck, or it was my computer. There is wifi in the lobby, but I never stayed in there long enough to try it out. Maybe if I'd been down lower in the hotel... damn my love of high rooms!2. I did have another one... I cannot for the life of me remember what it was... Oh well, I'll remember it in a minute and curse myself!Things I have no info on: restaurants, gym, spa, breakfast, dinner, weddings etc.","New South Wales, Australia","simcarose</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New South Wales, Australia</strong>",22,4.0

The amenities in the room were impressive - they had a coffee maker that used UCC pods and the toiletries are all L'Occitane which they keep refilling everyday! One observation though, when I moved a side table (because I was looking for an outlet on my side of the bed) I noticed that the wall behind it wasn't cleaned because there were dust that had accumulated (since I don't know when!) The room is quite pricey - but I guess its all worth it since the room is really big! Our room had wifi - but I had a hard time logging in because my iPhone kept rejecting the password. So, I never used the hotel's wifi. Good thing I rented a portable wifi device from Global Advanced (they delivered it through post and the package was given to me upon check in)The room has a safe that has an outlet inside (I don't know why it has an outlet!) They also have adaptors for you to use for your plugs - and an extension cord too! Brilliant right?The housekeeping was really accommodating to my every request of extra towels and toiletries.

The Shinjuku Station is about a 10 - 15 minute walk from the hotel (I was reading reviews here that it was 5 minute walk - yeah, I guess if you brisk walk!) There are a LOT of malls near the Shinjuku Station so you won't need to go far. There's a Yodobashi Camera in the area too!Another thing that I liked with the hotel is that they have a FREE shuttle service going to Disneyland. You'd just need to book in advance because apparently - it gets full quickly. I reserved a month before I arrived - I wanted to make sure we had a slot. There's a convenience store on the floor below the lobby that closes really late. The prices there are not as bad as I thought - its even a bit cheaper compared to Lawson or Family Mart (but i can't really confirm)The concierge was really helpful in keeping my ice packs frozen and keeping our stroller. They even accommodated my request for packing tape (even if they gave me duct tape).Was really happy that we chose this hotel. I will stay here again in case we decide to go back to Tokyo.I won't post any pictures anymore as the site's images are quite accurate already.You can sign up for their EIC membership - it says on the website that you can get free breakfast and a special check in counter. I signed up for this BUT wasn't given the privileges because they said I didn't book using their EIC rate (we got the 45days early bird rate).","Manila, Philippines","candishhh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",45,4.0

The same restaurants hold the breakfast buffet, you need to line up when it's really early, but the line vanishes as the morning goes. Average breakfast but it's what you would expect in a buffet - cereals, breads, bacon, ham, juices, fruits.The proximity to the malls and the train stations is the real plus, since taxi cab rides in Tokyo is similar to the experience of getting held hostage.A little pricier than most hotels in the area, but of course you'd expect hotels to be fully booked given that it's cherry blossom season.

The Lobby was really nice but huge and impersonal.Off the lobby is a sort of concourse where there are numerous restaurants, Unfortunately, we didn't have a chance to try them due to fatigue after packed days of sightseeing. For breakfast, we found essentially two restaurants. At the Chinese one which seemed to be included in tour group packages (we were not in a tour group), I had scrambled eggs from the buffet and they were awful (tasted like powdered eggs or something). Everything else, including the orange juice was not much better. We then discovered the restaurant next-door to the Chinese restaurant- Jurin, I think it was called, where they served much more of a western-type breakfast and it was far better ( at approx. 30 US per person) so we ate there for the rest of our week's stay. The only problem for us was these restaurants didn't open until 7 AM. For dinner, due to fatigue, we ordered room service every night and we found the food decent or terrible. I would not do that again.The staff knew basic English but not much more (quite typical actually of Japan except in Kyoto). As a result, I wanted to mail something and the person couldn't even tell me where I could mail it. I discovered there was a mailbox right at Reception.There were three reasons I had picked this hotel: 1) the airport limousine bus from Narita Airport stops at this hotel 2) I thought Shinjuku would be a fairly good spot for sightseeing and 3) a variety of restaurants in the area. The airport limousine bus worked out great but Shinjuku was not a great location for sightseeing. We spent a lot of time travelling across the city. From what I know now, I would stay in Ginza which is much more central for sightseeing and actually has some good affordable hotels as well. As for the restaurants: yes, there were some different options but it was freezing while we were there and we were too wiped at the end of every day to explore.","Montreal, Canada","HayKay1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",116,4.0

The room was spacious and very comfortable, but the bathroom was stuck in 1970--very small by today's standards and lacking the separate shower stall that is currently expected in good hotels. I also hated the step up to the bathroom--it's easy to forget and trip over it. Service was excellent--a little too good at times, such as when my room service meal arrived 15 minutes earlier than promised, when I was still in the shower. But when I needed drops for an eye infection, I was promptly assisted by the concierge, who took me to the hotel pharmacy to get the right ones. Whether you stay at the Keio Plaza depends on how much you like being in Shinjuku, a major hub whose station is a jumping-off point for many train and subway lines. (The station is a brisk 5-minute walk through the west concourse of the station, and the fact that it's enclosed makes a big difference in a rainy country.) Personally, I much prefer to be near the Ginza, which is more walkable and less high-rise, and features the Kabuki-za and Hibiya Park.

Keio Hotel is strategically located, close to many affordable dining places and entertainment bars. If you are a ramen enthusiast, a 5-minute walk will reveal dozens of small restaurants offering many ramen varieties. The area is also littered with many convenience stores for quick purchases of bottled water, canned drinks, Japanese bread, pre-packed bentos and ice cream.When booking a room, try getting one with a view of the Tokyo metropolitan government building as this will show a good view of the western side of Tokyo.

So imagine my disappointment when I stayed 5 nights in this hotel. And we only booked this hotel as my favoured hotel was fully booked since this was quite a last minute trip. Anyway after reading the reviews, my sister decided to give it a try as it was (1) recommended by her colleague who stayed here before (2) the free shuttle service to Disneyland/Sea. My first impression of the hotel was it was huge. There were tour groups, air crew and just crowded most of the time. After we checked in, we went to our room (Plaza Biz Plus) and was surprise by the size of it. Really tiny for the price but since we don't stay in the room that much, it is fine. So we tried connecting the wifi numerous times following the instruction in the room and it was still not working. We called front desk for assistance and they sent someone up the room to check. This guy was working at the front desk as I remembered seeing him when we were checking in. When he came, he appeared very disgruntled as if he was not suppose to be doing this but got sent up anyway. So while he was trying to solve the issue, my sister asked him if there was a business center and he gave a very curt ""No' reply. He got the wifi working and left and then my sister found out that the business center was in the lobby of the main tower where we were at. Now, either he didn't understand the question which I highly doubt or he was just being really unprofessional and rude. To me, this sets the tone for the rest of my stay in the hotel. And by the way, the wifi sucks and didn't work most of the time. The bed and pillow was also quite uncomfortable at least for me.As the hotel stay came free with 1 breakfast, we decided to try it out. As it was a huge hotel, there were numerous cafes/restaurants where they assign you for your breakfast. We went to the lobby cafe and had our breakfast there. The variety was ok, but again, the service was just not to par. Nobody clears the cutleries and it looks like the cafe was understaffed. So there were uncleared cutleries on tables and nobody to clear them immediately. And then there was a line of people waiting. Thank goodness we didn't wait long for a table as we were there pretty early. As for location of the hotel, I can only say it is not as ideal as I thought it would be as it is situated quite a distance from the West entrance of Shinjuku station, and it does take awhile to walk although we got used to it after 5 days! You do need some time to orientate yourself due to the numerous exits and entrances. There were quite a number of food places around the hotel but that is it. The only plus for us is the free disney shuttle bus to and fro from Disneysea. Otherwise, this hotel is just way too impersonal, cold and unwelcoming. Overall, I would not stay here again for the unprofessional service rendered, the location and the price.","Seattle, Washington","Winnie K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",13,2.0

Keio consists of two towers: Main Tower and South Tower. Amidst our stay, there were big tour groups and conferences. For such a bustling hotel, the staff were super-duper friendly and attentive. We stayed in one of the Plaza Premier rooms. I have to stay the room was amazingly comfortable. The room was bigger than I expected. Our window faced the Tokyo Metropolitan Government Office Building and the Shinjuku Central Park. The room lavished us with L'occitane products, specifically the Verbena product line (i.e. shower gel, shampoo, conditioner, and body lotion). I'm quite a fan of the France-based products. Addition to the shower amenities, the room was equipped with a Keurig! I'm also a coffee junkie and have a Keurig at home. The fact that the Keio Plaza has these in the rooms earned them extra points upon our arrival.Did I mention its convenient location? It's a quick walk to one of the busiest train station in Tokyo (if not THE busiest): Shinjuku Station. Perks:- L'occitane shower products;- Keurig;- Comfortable room;- Terrific location; - Free Wifi;- Free shuttle ride to Tokyo Disneyland (yes, it's free);- Transporation service to Narita Airport (with a fee); and- Friendly staffCon:I wasn't crazy about the pink counter and bath tub, albeit-- that's more of a personal opinion though.I will definitely stay here again if I were to head back to Tokyo again. Heck, I was raving about the hotel so much when I came home that my sister and her boyfriend will be booking at the Keio Plaza when they visit Tokyo in July.","Honolulu, Hawaii","doublezeroyogi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",20,4.0

The room was good sized for Tokyo hotels, expect the same size as you would for a standard New York hotel.

Family and friends we knew from Japan spoke highly of the Keio Plaza as it is seen to be a very grand and luxurious hotel for years. This is likely why the rate is quite expensive as it is living off reputation. All things considered you can likely find a similar/better experience for cheaper...may take a hit on location though.Front desk and lobby is quite nice and spacious. Service (like everywhere in Japan) was great and extremely accommodating. Once we got to our room however, although it was large the decor and furniture was quite dated and old. Nothing overly special. Location is one of the best things about Keio as it is walking distance (there is a direct path pretty much) from Shinjuku Station, which is the busiest station in all of Japan. So from Shinjuku you can pretty much get anywhere in Tokyo, including the N'EX (Narita Express) train to the airport. No transfers needed. There are some restaurants near by as well as shopping towards the station.Final notes: -there is wifi if requested. Front desk will give you a mini wifi router to plug into the room for wifi...if there are any available. I had no problem though.-If you are traveling to different hotels, or to the airport, people in Japan often send their luggage using courier services.

There are many good restaurants nearby and some great parks. BUT - I think if I had my time again I would stay in Shibuya - a bit more action and much more shopping. The Tokyo Government Building (which has a free observation deck) is only one street away and the hotel is a short 3-4 minute walk from Shinjuku station which has a lot of train lines running through it. The Room: A really good size, clean and modern. What you would expect from a standard hotel in Australia. The bathroom is a bit weird - it feel a little like something you would see on a large boat, moulded plastic and certainly not luxury but adequate. The room had a Nespresso coffee machine, which I loved (I have one at home) and the use of this is also free. King size bed was firm - I liked it - but if you like a soft bed be prepared. The Hotel: We didn't try any of the onsite food outlets - they seemed overpriced and there are so many great little places nearby. Hotel check in was easy, the desk staff spoke English (not fabulous but enough) and were friendly and polite. We took our own bags up so we didn't deal with the Bell Staff until we were checking out.

We stayed here on an overnight with a 6pm checkout and buffet breakfast in a king room(?) on the club floor which cost around $450, so it was not cheap by any means.The room was fantastic and very very spacious with great big celing to floor windows that framed a perfect tokyo skline, with electric window shutters that were great. The bed was massive and super comfortable and the bathroom toiletries were subperb by La Occitane. Had a fantastic coffee machine, lots of cupboard space, and a heated toilet seat! The cons; On exiting the elevator to our floor 38 I immediately noticed the carpets hadnt been vacummed, I would consider this unacceptable in any hotel especiallu considering this was the club floor. Then on entering the hotel room I noticed the carpets were heavily stained - not what you expect really from this type of establishment. Breakfast was another disappointment, generally when I have stayed on the club floor there is a separate restaurant which serves buffet breakfast especially for club floor guests which is always nice, although not a necessity, however we didnt even have the luxury of just entering the restuarant (located on the basement floor) without having to stand in a queue for 20 minutes! Im sorry but that is totally unacceptable especially for anyone who may have had a plane to catch or a meeting to attend. Then when we were shown to a tiny little table in amongst many other tiny little tables, we went to get our breakfast and returned to a rather flustered gentlemen advising us that we had to be shown to our table - um im pretty sure that just happened?? Nope he then showed us to another table and it was then we realised that there were about 6 tables unocccupied and we'd been waiting in line! along with about 30 others most of which were still waiting. Once again as with most Japanese hotels the television viewing was limited in english and you had to pay for movies and internet TV. All in all our room was tired and in need of some refurbishment, however it delivered a distant memory of luxury and class which lingers within its walls and too which I enjoyed.

Good location, especially if you are familiar with Tokyo's vast and sophisticated public transport system. Very good for the newcomer who doesn't want to find their way in from the ridiculously-far-away-from-everything Narita (just hop on the Airport Limo). Lots of little restaurants in the Shinjuku area, especially the Natural Lawson for a little organic snack when you awake at 3 am.But the once grand and well-appointed hotel has aged. Just as the Japanese baby boomers can quickly recall the heady days of the past and it blinds them to Japan's major problem with demographics and debt, the hotel still demands top dollar as it did so many years ago.

The restaurants within the hotel seemed very expensive, but there is a myriad of dining choices around the Shinjuku area, so you won't want to eat in the hotel anyway!

Since the train station is HUGE, it's a little hard to navigate the Shinjuku station itself though which means we got lost once or twice in the station. The hotel itself is very big with two wings. The wingwe stayed in, which was the South wing if I'm not mistaken, was the one that wasn't recently renovated so the room was a little old and dated in interiors. However, the large size of the room made up for it given that Japan is notorious for small rooms.

The standard rooms in the south tower are very dated. After spending 5 minutes in the rooms we decided to upgrade to the deluxe the the main tower. For only approx $40 per night the difference was amazing. The main tower rooms were of a high standard and nicely modernized, although the bathrooms are still a little quirky. Beds are a little hard for my liking but we found this common in Japan. We found the rooms warm and so left the blind open to cool them down. Got colder quickly in the Japanese winter.The location for this hotel is amazing and right on the doorstep of a hundred restaurants and very close to the station.The Polestar bar on the 45th floor is recommended just for the view alone. If you order some of the whiskeys they give you one solid single sphere of ice about as large as a baseball to cool your drink. Amazing.We ate at the teppan-yaki and the steak was great but the price is quite high for the more deluxe (kobe beef and lobster set).Disney shuttle service is fantastic. We went to both Disney Land and Sea. Just book the day before. Make sure you are not late coming back as they don't wait as we found out because we wanted to catch the last of the Disney Light show.

Hardly a state-of-the-art system for a technology driven nation.2. Breakfast is appalling. You have two choices of buffet. The first is in the restaurant ""Jurin"". This place opens at 6am. If you are familiar with English boarding school breakfasts of the 1970's you'll have an idea of what it's all about. Avoid it. The second option is the Glass buffet. This opens at 7am. Substantially better than Jurin but still way off the mark. Chef seems to prefer to waft food in the general direction of a convection fan heater rather than a grill or oven.

The only complaint we would have was that the rooms were very warm but we found this to be the case in other hotels and in the department stores and trains.

The convenience store in the hotel was a great benefit so that we could get snacks and drinks for our room. We had the buffet breakfast in the hotel on one day - although there was a good selection, we found it to be over-priced (even for Japan), the buffet was not beimg consistently stocked, none of the food was hot and the eggs at the omelet station were very undercooked (I don't even usually mind it when they are slightly runny).

I stayed for 2 nights in a Superior room (main tower) took a quick 1 night trip to Osaka and then came back for 2 more nights in a Plaza Premier (also main tower).The superior room was extremely dated. It was actually quite disappointing when I first walked in. You could tell the carpet and furniture had not been changed in quite some time. While the room itself was clean, you couldnt help but shake the dingy/dusty feel to it since everything was so old. The plaza premier was much better as the bedding and furnishings were updated. There was a minor hiccup of sorts as I had booked a King bed but upon entering the room was surprised to find 2 doubles. At that point I was a bit too worn out from all the day traveling to go back downstairs to complain, so I just made it into a euro style super king and took 2 minutes to push the 2 beds together.As others had mentioned, the location of the hotel was fairly convenient from Shinjuku station. There is a decent amount of restaurants, bars within short walking distance from the hotel, just west of the station. The walk to the more bustling side of Shinjuku (east/north) is also no more than a 15 minute walk.I didnt book breakfast with the hotels but ended up eating at the hotel once for convenience. Bad mistake. The breakfast buffet was terrible, and also a terrible value at approx 3,000Y. Honestly, I've had better breakfasts at Denny's or any other cheap diner.

Facilities: No sauna, swimming pool only in summer (outdoor) and not available for early birds as business guests as it opens only 9am.Breakfast buffet (we just tried the western one) does not offer a big variety.Location is great Shinjuku station is 10 min by walk - could not find the car/bus service which was mentioned. But it is not really necessary when you travel with small luggage.In total it is just overpriced even for Tokyo. Would not stay there again but give the chance to another.",,Andy F,1,2.0

No WiFi (free wired internet...instead I rented a pocket MiFi router), no voicemail (a blinking message light meant the front desk had a paper message for you). Staff was very friendly, willing to help and spoke sufficient English. But it's clean, the rooms are spacious by Japanese standards, the amenities are good, shops and restaurants inside. We were a party of three (mom and two adult sons) and had two twin beds (which were comfortable) and a sofa bed (not so comfy) yet still had room to move around. Closet and drawer space OK for two; tight for three. But if you're on vacation, you shouldn't be spending that much time in the room! I LOVE the convenient location. Easy walking distance to Shinjuku train station, the artery for virtually every mode of public transportation. (Straight shot if leaving out the south exit.) A few short blocks away from the Government Building (free scenic views of the city), several shopping areas on the west side and the nightlife of east Shinjuku. Free shuttle bus to Tokyo Disney (must reserve seat), Airport Limo bus stops at their front door (and they have a vending machine that sells return tickets to the airport). Good price through hotels.com. Very decent place. You can pay more for something nicer, but why?","Los Angeles, California","Siliobear</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",16,4.0

The rooms are small but very comfortable. They include a small refrigerator and a hot water tea kettle (no coffee but you can buy instant, milk, & sugar for the room at a convenient store like we did. The hotel is expensive, but a deal by Tokyo standards. The restaurants in the hotel are also high, but any of the 3 breakfast buffets are worth it for a good start in this busy city. The shops in the hotel are actually cheaper than stores on surrounding streets (wine was a good buy, and so were the wide choice of ethic souvenirs). You can charge hotel meals on your credit card, but not anything in the hotel shops (cash only). The hotel is only a couple blocks from the massive Shinjuku railroad/subway station for good access to all of Tokyo. The Tokyo Municipal Building with it's 2 free observation decks is next door.","Waukegan, Illinois","Peter B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waukegan, Illinois</strong>",20,4.0

The hotel is huge and clearly in the process of being upgraded. I stayed in the South tower on the 20th floor. The room was clean and had everything you would expect from a large city hotel , however it was somewhat shabby and old fashioned and in need of a make over. The bed and bed linen were disappointingly uncomfortable and in this day and age I expect better quality pillows. The highlight however was the view of Mount Fuji from the bedroom window, despite this being my second trip to Tokyo this is the first time I have ever seen this majestic icon. It truly was an awesome sight.A colleague was staying the the main tower on the 38th floor. These are significantly better rooms with modern decor, a fully stocked mini bar, luxury bathroom products, free wifi and comfortable beds and bed linen. For very little difference in price the difference in quality was huge.The hotel has a swimming pool which did not look particularly inviting and a small fitness room. The fitness room has three treadmills, two cross trainers and an exercise bike. There is a set of hand weights from 1kg to 10kg (no bench) and a leg press and chest press machine, enough to do a basic workout.We tried the coffee shop downstairs for one lunch and one breakfast, food was reasonable but we found it to be quite expensive. If you can find the coffee shop called Paul Bossett nearby, use that for coffee and breakfast, the pancakes there were to die for.The Polestar cocktail bar is a great place to relax with a drink after a long day shopping. Outstanding service and great cocktails. The view from this restaurant in the 45th floor is outstanding, you do not need to go to the ubiquitous Park Hyatt and pretend you are Scarlett Johansson or Bill Murray.Overall the location and cleanliness of this hotel make up for its shortcoming.",Melbourne,"Natasha09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",99,4.0

We arrived in Shinjuku at night, and were lost for 45 minutes trying to find the way out from the massive train station. There was no sign board directed to the hotel, the only landmark near to the hotel was Tokyo Goverment Office. Hence, if you are looking for the hotel signboard at Shinjuku station, you are not going to find it! Typical to Japanese fashion, the check in was done quickly and efficiently, and we were ushered to our room in less than 15 minutes.
