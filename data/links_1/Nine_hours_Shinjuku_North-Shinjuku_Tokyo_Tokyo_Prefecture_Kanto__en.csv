I did it because you have to try it once in Tokyo. However, after the 1st time I booked the Nine Hours in Shinjuku I booked another night. Now, two years later I'm back and this place hasn't changed it's awesome. Super efficient just what a solo traveler wants. I want my time spent out exploring Tokyo. When I come back to my accommodation I don't need a room, the locker holds my backpack and they can store your larger luggage, no extra charge. The solid shower before heading to the airport is worth the stay. Large bathroom with an awesome clean shower and everything you need to get your day started. I came here for the experience and left as a lifetime customer.","Soldotna, Alaska","KenaiDriftAnglers</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Soldotna, Alaska</strong>",4,5.0

The hotel is really modern and clean. The checkin checkout process went quickly and the staff is very friendly!The room : capsules are clean and comfortable, there is a light and plug to charge your phone. The capsules are not isolated, you can hear everything thats happening in the room, if you’re unlucky and have to sleep with noisy people it could be a bit annoying. But most of people are very respectfull. Keep in mind it’s a hostel you can’t require full silence.The bathroom: is very modern, there are a lot of toilets and showers, no need to wait for your turn!Maybe they should put some music in the bathrooms. I understand the bedrooms should be quiet but the Silent Vibe in the bathroom is a bit creepy.. ( but that’s just my vibe, I put music everywhere I go)Breakfast: If you add I think 3 euros you have breakfast included in your stay. Breakfast is not at the hostel it’s in a restaurant 1 min from the hostel. I would not recommend it. It’s not the best breakfast and I think the area offers so much more food to discover than to go to this place.Lobby: it’s a comfortable place to chill/work/chat. I think it’s a good hotel for 1 or 2 nights but not for a long time because you can not unpack. Your luggage stays in the lockers so you have to be a bit organized (preparing your clothes for the next day, your bathroom amenities to go shower,..). The hotel provides towels , a pijama slippers and toothbrush, soap etc which is really cool!Overall very nice experience , I would totally recommend! ",,Clarahdb,5,5.0

Nine Hours certainly accommodated that. From the very entrance, this place oozes simplicity, futuristic styling and good service. Elevator takes you to the 8th floor where you check-in with staff who have a reasonable grasp of the English language. They explain how Nine Hours works e.g. if you're staying more than one night you check out at 10 and check back in later. The 'all women' capsules are on the 6th floor however, the showers are on another level (I didn't need them). As soon as you get out of the elevator on the 6th floor, there are lockers for your gear, toilets and handbasins. The capsules are through another door that indicates ""quiet"". If you have trouble climbing up a few stairs, ask for a capsule on the floor level. There are slipon slippers for each capsule which you dispose of before you leave. I crawled into mine, pulled the blind down to give me some privacy and just soaked up the peace. First thing I noticed was how clean it was and no odours or smells. Nice. There are two small shelves moulded into the capsule which are useful for putting your devices while they charge (note that the plug is a little tricky - put your plug in a small way, then turn sideways 90 degrees and push). If found the mattress a little hard but the pillow just fine. Unfortunately for me being tall, the doona (duvet) was a little short. There is very little outside noise, really the only sound is the airconditioning maintaining a constant temperature. Once people started arriving to bed down for the night it got noisy. Consider it a funky dormitory. You can hear people coming and going, snoring, coughing etc. but there is the privacy of your capsule that makes it interesting. It also feels very safe being amongst just women. Check out was quick and simple. There is a large space on the 8th floor where you can look at views of Shinjuku from the floor to ceiling windows both north and south. That, along with a massive table, benches and chairs, there is plenty of time to catch up on work if you need to. It's modern and sparse but somewhat inviting. Located within the Korean District and not from the Robot Restaurant, there is plenty to see and do in and around Nine Hours. I would highly recommend a visit.

The concept is great and very easy to check-in and out. The capsule is very big for one person and it does not feel claustrophobic at all. This specific hotel is a very short walk to the main area of Shinjuku. If you get breakfast included, the cafe is few seconds walk, down the main road. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that you have to change where the lockers are, there is no changing room. You can always change inside the shower room but, it is a bit hot and not very comfortable to do so there.","London, United Kingdom","Alessandrolnd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",16,4.0

I have actually stayed in something similar before - it's called a hostel. That's really what it is so if you're like me thinking you need to try a capsule hotel to complement your Japan experience, don't. It's not really the hostel's fault - it's the idiot/inconsiderate guests who stay there; wheeling in their bags at all hours of the night making noise when you're meant to make use of the space and lockers outside the sleeping area, alarms going off in the morning etc. you just have a thin blind to close your pod so you hear EVERYTHING with at least 20 other pods in the sleeping area. The pod was a bit hot (I need to sleep with a window open or a fan blowing or air con etc. so this was a bit stressful initially). I appreciate I might be sounding a bit like a diva but I've done my hostel time and coming off an 8 hour flight it was really not my best idea. Luckily I was checking into a proper hotel for the rest of my stay so I was out like a flash the next morning. If you're young and travelling around and budgeting with hostels - then go for gold, but if you're like me - give it a miss.

I went back to reception and was issued another key to an empty locker. Fortunately I didn't have any luggage with me.

There is a common space near the reception where you can eat, browse the internet or have a chat with friends. Check-in and check-out is quite efficient, which is even better because you have to check out every day before 10am while the hotel is being cleaned. Location is 10/10, only a 2 minute walk from Shin-Okubo station and surrounded by food, shops and convenience stores. You could spend an entire day exploring Shin-Okubo, particularly if you are a fan of Korean pop culture and beauty products. You get an amenity bag daily with slippers, pyjamas, towels, a toothbrush and toothpaste. Handy for those who forgot to bring these items or want to reduce their load of laundry. The capsules are pleasantly spacious and there is a power point to charge your electronics inside. You can't lock your capsules but there is a screen you can pull down if you want privacy. I would highly recommend staying here if you have a JR pass (Shin-Okubo is on the JR Yamanote line very close to Shinjuku, Harajuku and Shibuya) or if you would like to experience a capsule hotel in Tokyo.",,KimberlyY4416,7,5.0

Having come from our first night in a traditional ryokan, a capsule hotel was also a must-do on our list.This hotel is a 2 minute walk from a train station (shin-okubo) which connects to the busiest local train line in Tokyo (Yamanote line). This hotel is therefore super convenient for the train and hopping around Tokyo Central. There is a 7-11 store just around the corner and you're right at the heart of Korea Town so there's plenty of places to eat and drink.This place is good to meet other travellers but also good if you need a cheap place to stay with a comfortable bed and a hot shower. Each day you can check in from 1pm and you're given a QR code key for your locker, towels, a toothbrush and toothpaste, and some pyjamas and a pair of slippers. The service here is brilliant and the staff speak good English. The place is super clean and mostly very quiet, with amazing views from either window in the relaxation area. Here you can take calls, eat, drink, and go on laptops. You can't smoke anywhere in this building. The lockers are good and have a separate section for your shoes and somewhere to hang your suit if you have one. The showers provide shampoo, conditioner, and soap and are a lovely temperature. There is also a bath on the ladies shower floor, not sure about the mens. When you enter the hotel you do so using the central elevator. The lift on the left of the centre is for men and the other one is for women. Each pod is for one person only. The lockers and pods are on the same floors and men and women have two floors each as well as a showers room. There are plenty of showers, sinks, and toilets. Please be a considerate guest and be as quiet as possible in the pods, turn your phone to silent apart from your alarm and don't take calls in here. The walls between the pods are quite thin and basically its like a novelty hostel. The building is also near to the train line so the pods do shake a bit when the train goes past. Each pod has a privacy blind, a duvet, mattress and a pillow and two small shelves, somewhere to charge your device(s) and an adjustable light. Check out is at 10 every day and you can't get another key card until 1pm. This is for safety reasons and they also have to have time to keep the place clean!This place is well priced and well located.",,Blythe B,1,4.0

The daily check in/check out requirements make multi-day stays a bit annoying, and the pods could use more than 1 outlet which is the only reason this review is a 4 instead of a 5.

When you first step in it looks really cool, however for myself I wish I’d have left after the first 5 minutes. The capsules seem to amplify the noise by there shape and position, also the fact that they are plastic probably doesn’t help. It honestly felt like staying in a dormitory with 100 roommates. For some reason the floor got really busy around midnight with somebody coming in or leaving every 5 minutes. I’m not sure if it’s the fact that you can hear everything so well or that I was particularly unlucky with my roommates for the night, but at 2 am I had to ask someone to turn to sound of on their phone as they were playing a game. Of course the hotel is not at fault for the behavior of its guests, but it seems to me that they attract certain behavior by allowing 24h check in and by not making the capsules noise proof. Other than the pair of pajamas you get and the capsule itself the hotel offers nothing special, the capsules are not equipped with anything special and the common space has nothing that makes you want to hang out there (which is probably why people are playing games in their pods) breakfast is at a nearby diner. All in all the experience is cool but I’ll definitely never stay at 9h again.O they also give a gift to anyone who shows them they leave a review on TripAdvisor, so expect reviews to be biased.

It's right in the middle of Korea town, and there are loads of food options in the immediate vicinity.The pods are surprisingly large - not claustrophobic at all. Mattresses are firm but comfy. Pillow's are a little weird, but not unusable. Bathrooms are well equipped, private and squeaky clean. I was expecting to be able to plug a usb cord into the console to charge my phone, but the outlet in the pod was a normal Japanese wall plug - so take your whole charger and adaptor in with you. There was nowhere to open a suitcase in the locker room, so you have to do all your organising on the floor in everybody's way. Also, the pyjamas are definitely not one size fits all westerners. The pods are no more soundproof than a dormitory, but are more private.

The property has 3 elevators and only one of them allows access from street level to the 8th floor where the reception and the lounge are. Separate elevators connect to male and female floors from the 8th floor, meaning you have to connect on the 8th floor everytime you return to your pod (room) from outside. Some consider this an inconvenience, some consider this added security. Lockers and restrooms are on the same floor as your pods. My 29"" suitcase was able to fit into the locker which was a huge plus. Towels, toothbrush, pajamas, and slippers were provided. The water pressure of the showers was extremely good. However, the showers were not on the same floor as the pods which I did find inconvenient. The pods were fitted with light switches and a power outlet.

I had anticipated for some noise, but even with earplugs, I didn't get much sleep. I did not book anywhere I stayed in Japan longer than 3 nights, just in case. On the last night here, I was so stuffed, I woke up when the cleaners moved in at 10am.Also, I thought the guy in the next pod was having a fight with himself, he was tossing and turning so much, my pod was shaking.There were other disturbances also, like people getting up at 3am to go catch a plane.Their name 9 Hours is apparently from the ""three basic actions: take a shower, sleep, and get yourself dressed – one hour + seven hours + one hour"". For me, I would say it more like: 15min + 3 hours + 10mins.You must also get out of the sleeping area by 10am each day. Not a problem if you are sightseeing every day. But it means you do have to remove all items from your Pod. You get to keep the same locked and can lock your bag there at all times.There is a locker room area (just outside the pod sleeping area) where you store your bag that is good. The only problem is, there is no room to open your bag to sort things out, like getting new clothes for the day. I used the floor to lay my bag open, but this can be tricky with everyone trying to get passed you.Men and women are on separate floors. The showers are on another floor. The reception is on another. There is a separate lift for men and women.So to get up in the morning, to have a shower and get dressed, I would have to grab some new clothes, go up the lift for a shower, go down the lift to my bag again, then go in the lift to reception (book in/out each day), then down to Ground to go out. I would say this would become tedious waiting for the lift, after a few nights, and trying to remember the items you need to take from your bag.My tip – have a few drinks.My recommendation: The Millennials Shibuya.

Each person gets a locker which has pajamas, flip flops, towels, and toothbrush inside as well as space to leave your luggage. The rooms, toilets, and showers are divided between male and female with different floors as well as elevators. Female rooms are located on two different floors and showers are located on a third floor. It's convenient and fast to move from one floor to the other. The showers are quite big and provided with shampoo, conditioner, and space to put your clothes. Inside each capsule, you can find a socket and you have a curtain to close your capsule when sleeping. The capsules look much bigger than in the picture and are very comfortable. The pillow is a little thin and hard, different from what I am used to finding in hotels, but impressively was comfortable. In the reception, there is a common area with tables and chair, simple and clean.Wifi is good and works well!It's close to Shinjuku station, around 10 minutes walking. There are a lot of restaurants, mini markets, 7Elevens around.You need to check-in and check-ou every day. This is the reason we stayed there only 1 night. I think would be a hassle to stay in this hotel for 5 days having to check-out every day at 11 AM and check-in at 1 PM.","Barcelona, Spain","Claudinhazen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong>",26,4.0

Being that this was a very last minute trip, I opted to keep the cost down by booking a capsule hotel. Nine Hours Shinjuku-North recently opened in March 2017 so I decided to try it out.Nine Hours Shinjuku-North is located about a 1-2 minute walk from the Shin Okubo station on the JR Yamanote (Green) line. This is 1 stop after Shinjuku station. It is also about 10 minutes walk from Okubo station on the Chuo line and 10-15 minutes walk from Higashi-Shinjuku station which is serviced by Toei and Tokyo Metro. The surrounding neighborhood is known as being largely korean and has a plethora of shops and restaurants. A Don Quijote is nearby and Golden Gai can be reached within 20 minutes of walking.Once at the building, take the elevator from the ground floor to the reception in the 8th floor. Check in is starts at 1pm everyday and checkout is by 10am the following day. Like most other capsule hotels, even if you have a consecutive night stay you still have to check out and check in. For consecutive night guests, your bags can remain in your locker during the checkout period. At check in you will be issued a paper card with a QR code which grants you access to your locker. Floors are separated by gender and there are only 3 elevators. 1 is from the ground floor to reception and the other two is for male and female floors. For males, floor are on 3 or 4 and determined by your keycard. Once on your proper floor, locker storage and sleeping capsules can be accessed. You unlock your locker with your QR card given at check in. While others opened flawlessly, mine always had trouble scanning and needed to be held for 10-20 seconds. This was even acknowledged by some staff members as buggy and not normal. The locker easily held my 28"" check in bag, shoes, and other goods. Disposable slippers are issued and must be used while indoors (bathroom, capsule area, locker area). Guests are issued a body towel, face towel, and toothbrush with toothpaste everyday. You are also provided sleeping wear. For those who have oversized bags that do not fit in lockers, it may be stored in the lounge area.The pod itself is very spacious and I never felt constrained. Pods are configured in a 2 level staggered system. You are issued a blanket and Japanese buckwheat pillow. There is 1 AC outlet and the light control. In accordance with Japanese laws, it is illegal for pods to lock and as such there is no door. Instead, a blind comes down to ensure privacy. I did find that it got stuffy for me and ventilation wasn't as constant as I thought it would be. As such, I slept without a shirt to cool myself down. The pod experience is hit or miss. I came i knowing that it would be directly influenced by others. While everyone tried to stay quiet within the area, sounds could be heard throughout the night be it someone's phone going off, someone entering or exiting the pod, coughing, snoring, or farting. I came prepared with ear plugs which came in handy. None were provided by the hotel.The 7th floor is the shower and washroom with provided body wash, shampoo, and conditioner. The 8th floor is the reception area and just behind it is the lounge area. The lounge is equipped with 4 desks, a long bar table, and a long wood table with plenty of seats and power outlets throughout. There are also benches that face the floor to ceiling windows which offer a beautiful view of Shinjuku, especially at night. The lounge area is the only area within the hotel where food may be consumed. Wifi is free and reaches all floors. Finally, the lounge area is also where bags may be left, even after checkout. Note that this is unattended although Japan is very safe. Overall I left with my budget-minded experience very satisfied. The location was excellent. If I could leave a few recommendations it would be for the caspule to have an additional AC outlet or a dedicated USB outlet. I would also prefer if the capsule had better ventilation and a possible alarm system built into the capsule. Finally, although Japan is overall safe and the hotel has limited space, if the baggage storage area could be monitored by staff it would give the extra peace of mind. I highly recommend Nine Hours Shinjuku-North to all those interested.","Honolulu, Hawaii","madcapsules</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",59,5.0

Being prepared for a quite uncomfortable stay, I was surprised how good it was. Especially if you consider the price (I payed €21,31 for one night). Easy check in, very clean (and many) restrooms, showers and pods (capsules) and big lockers which easily fitted my large backpack (70l) and normal sized rugsack. They provide you with slippers, pajamas and towels. The pods have a plug and a dim light. They were surprisingly large, so if I'd wanted I could have stored my rugsack in my pod. Everyone was being very quite. The only downside I could think of is that you shut the pod with a roll up curtain, so you can here everything outside your pod. Thankfully by that I only mean people walking to their pods and some alarms in the morning from people waking up. Plus you could feel a little movement when people would lie down in their pods. And last, the overnight stay is gender separated. There are even separated elevators for the men and women floors. It surely was no problem since my boyfriend and I only stayed one night, but if you stay for a longer period of time it might not be as fun. Though some might prefer it that way. The location is right next to the station and I could leave my luggage at the reception for as long as I wanted. Overall I highly recommend it if you want a capsule experience or want to visit Tokyo on a low budget.

The design and thought put into the place is exceptional. Don't expect hotel comforts though. You check in, get a pod & locker key, you then put your bags in the locker and either head to the lounge or out.. or change into the provided clothes to go to the showers floor which are each clean and lockable, or head to your sleep pod which is also clean. It has a power outlet, a light dimmer and aircon outlets. It's illegal for sleeping pods to be lockable in Japan. Instead you have a privacy screen you pull down which can kind of only be opened from inside. As a result you can here muffled noises of people coming in/out or snoring, but that's wot every capsule hotel.

The bathroom has very clean, individual shower cubicles with body wash, shampoo and conditioner. Also has hairdryers available to use. The pods are roomy and pretty comfy. Can be a noisy night if you have inconsiderate people coming in noisily at all hours. Pretty hard for the staff to predict or control that as it is clearly written everywhere for people to be quiet and considerate.

The pods were clean and the shower and facilities were of a high standard. The communal area was large and had free wifi with lots of sitting space so overall a very good experience. The 2 negatives were that on the friday morning there were a number of people leaving for work at around 5:30 - 6 which unfortunately meant that everyone on that particular floor was also awake at that time. The weekend didn't seem to be as much of a problem but earplugs would definitely be an advantage. 2nd minor issue was having to check out and back in each day. This meant a new locker and new pod each day which wasn't really a problem other than all of our bags having to be in the communal area all day unsupervised. Overall a good stay for the amount we paid.,,Duncan H,0,4.0

As I was forced to book this last resort because all the other 5 star hotels in town were fully booked due to the peak of Sakura season, my choice proved me wrong at the end. This WAS a very authentic experience and I definitely urge everyone who's in Tokyo to try it at least once in your life. You check in at 8F where all the registration process is through an iPad. The ""room keys"" they issue you is a simple paper ticket with a QR code on it which unlocks your locker. After registration is done, the gentleman and the ladies are separated, in which they were not encounter each other whatsoever unless they all go back to 8F ""lobby"".I went down to the ladies side of the building and the capsules are split evenly between two floors- 5&6 I believe. You will enter a locker room where you will store your luggage and change your shoes to indoor slippers. And in the locker will be towels and shower amenities for you to use during your stay.After you leave your luggage, directly ahead is the capsules in 2 rows. I was lucky to get a capsule on the upper bunk, but be ware that the capsule ""doors"" don't lock! It's just a plastic window-pane like panel that pulls up and down, it is against the rule to lock it in any way whatsoever. The capsules are actually more spacious than I had prepared myself to be, so tame your claustrophobic fear and go try it!Shower rooms are on a separate floor 7F, the individual shower rooms are super duper clean and upscale, it's the idea of a school dorm actually, except for old ladies like myself. You will encounter and see so many different kinds of people come and go as you sit there blow drying your hair. There is ONE shower room that has a bathtub to enjoy but it is usually occupied.All in all, it is an experience everyone should try while in Tokyo, nine hours is a safe bet as it is a local chain so it was well kept and easily accessed.","Boston, Massachusetts","missypinkaholic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",87,4.0
