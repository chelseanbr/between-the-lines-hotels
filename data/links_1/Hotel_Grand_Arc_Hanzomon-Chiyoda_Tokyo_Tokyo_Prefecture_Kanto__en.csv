We booked a non-smoking room well in advance but, when we arrived the reception said all non-smoking room has been booked out so they gave us a smoking room. We checked into the room and stayed for two hours but couldn’t bear the strong smell. Then my husband went to the reception to ask them to give us a non-smoking room, since we will stay in the hotel for another four days. At first the reception said he can’t do anything about it as all non-smoking rooms are booked out even for future dates. That was ridiculous, because we booked it three months in advance. After trying a few polite ways without results, my husband called his supervisor or manager. Like a magic spell, the reception went into a room, within five seconds and came out saying OK I’ll give you a non-smoking room for the rest of your stay, all sorted. We checked into the non-smoking room and stayed for another four days. Nothing special about the room, it’s a bit old fashioned and relatively clean room.

OK for a business stay, but would not stay here if travelling personally.Checkin: was OK, the staff speak English fairly well and was given WiFi password. Which worked for half a day as on Monday the password is reset and a new one is generated(?). Be aware of this.Rooms: Rooms are tiny even for Japan standards. The bed was squashed up against the wall - it was just enough for 1 person to move. There is a huge amount of hidden engineering in the room to make comfortable. For example the floor in the bathroom has a big incline, so the toilet seat buffers are different heights to keep the seat level. The toilet engineering has been covered in various posts, so will skip this plumbing marvel. The kettle has extra button that makes it inconvenient, but at least there is one. There is not enough room to open a bigger suitcase. Asking for an iron, I got one, but again over engineered. But no place to set it up.Slept OK though.Breakfast: You have a limited choice of US (scrambled eggs and ham), continental (yogurt and a couple of rolls) and Japanese a mixed concoction of weirdness for a western pallet. I tried the Japanese, but asked for black tea - was charged handsomely for this, despite this being just a simple substitution. Facilities: Website claims ""outdoor pool"" and also fitness center. Hotel has NOTHING.It is primarily used for events on function floors.Location: OK, it is close to a couple of Metro stations, but basically you are next to the Royal Palace grounds so quiet and not much happening. There are few restaurants, but basically you will use Metro for any trips.Summary: I was there on business as office is close by - If I stayed personally it would definitely NOT be first choice. Be aware if you do anything ""off standard"" you will be charged, and not by a small amount.

Chiyoda is more central, so we chose this neighbourhood and hotel. It’s a fine place - rooms are very small but that’s common with hotels in Tokyo (and japan more generally). The subway Hanzomon is literally 3 min away, and there are a number of coffee shops, family Marts/7-11/lawsons nearby if you fancy buying food instead of eating out. There’s also plenty of restaurants. We didn’t eat at the hotel. There are pleasant shrines and temples nearby. The imperial palace garden, parliament and theatre are also within 20 min walk. The next metro station, Nagatacho, is well catered for most lines. I’d recommend getting a day metro pass for 600 yen (basically, over three trips per 24 hs and it’s worth it). Shibuya is also on the purple hanzomon line so from the hotel you can be in Shibuya in 15 min. Overall a great place. Cleaning staff were attentive and replenished shampoo and others every day ( there’s a generous supply of everything including make up cleaner, lotion and face foam, which is a nice touch). The toilet is an experience - you need a PhD in engineering to figure out how to use it for the first time- but you’ll see these toilets everywhere (including public stations). The best part of the hotel is the spectacular view of Chiyoda (day and night). I read reviews that check in wasn’t very pleasant - I guess most tourists from Europe will arrive jet lagged early morning. Be mindful check in is at 2pm (although they let us in at 1pm). There’s no vending machine or complimentary stuff in the shared areas but if you sneak into a floor, they are there. Better yet, hoof it to family Mart in 3 min and get what you want.",UK,"eagertraveller123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>UK</strong>",155,5.0

The subway stop is close by, allowing easy access to more lively areas of the city. The rooms are small by Western standards (which is to be expected for Tokyo and completely normal) but very well appointed, organized and clean. Most of the rooms have fantastic views of the moat surrounding the palace and the business and government district surrounding the hotel. With the weddings and other events taking place at this hotel, you sort of feel that you are staying at a much more luxurious hotel. (By the way, it is not noisy at all.)

It is walking distance from the Budokan indoor arena where major concerts and major Sumo contests take place. The Hanzomon metro station is only 300 metres away with major shopping and entertainment centres of Tokyo only a few metro stops away. The hotel is not on any of the limousine bus routes from Narita or Haneda but it is not too hard to get there by public transport.The Room I had on the 11th floor was a little on the small size but not a surprise for Tokyo. I had a great view from my floor. The room was very clean. The shower worked well and there was bath (albeit a small one) which is becoming increasingly unusual in standard hotel rooms around the world. The toilet as is often the case in Japan is a jet toilet and for those who have not been to Japan before are in for a surprise. I stayed here over a weekend and there were a couple of weddings taking place but this was not a problem at all and did not disturb at all.The staff were excellent. Nothing was too much trouble and answered all the questions I had. Very helpful staff. I only ate breakfast at the hotel which is presented in a very pleasant area. My rate included breakfast and looking at the price was reasonable. It is not a buffet style system and there was not a great deal of it but for me enough to satisfy.There are a number of 24-hour shops in the area (as there are everywhere in Japan) and a few restaurants but this is more of a quieter area of Tokyo so if you are looking for wall restaurants and bars, take a quick metro or taxi ride.Overall my experience was excellent.

The staff were very friendly and the rooms were clean.We took one of the Japanese style rooms, which are made up as living areas during the day then converted to Japanese sleeping in the evening. This involved futons on the floor with pillows and quilts. We asked for and received extra pillows. Contrary to expectations it was actually quite comfortable. The drawbacks with the room, in common with many hotels in Tokyo are the lack of space for effective manipulation of suitcases and the bizarre need to purchase a card to watch television. This would have been worth it if there had been anything decent to watch in English! The effective WiFi meant that this was not necessary as we could watch our own programmes on iPads etc.The hotel coffee shop was a disappointment for dinner and the breakfast, to be frank, was awful. The American breakfast offering of runny scrambled eggs and anaemic bacon was disappointing and in my case was cold so I sent it back asking for a hot serving only to get the original back after a quick zap in the microwave!

Staff spoke good English. There are a few restaurants 5 minutes walk away. There is also a convenience store. Honzomon Station about 7 minutes walk away. The station has a lot of stairs. Not child friendly. It is a 30 minute walk from the main Asakasa restaurant, shopping, entertainment belt. The downside to this hotel was the location (for me). I chose this hotel based on a review that it is near Tokyo Station. (needed the Shinkansen) sigh... IT IS NOT NEAR TOKYO STATION! it is JPY2,000 cab ride away. Ginza would have been nearer. (my fault, should have checked but was super busy with work).Because we had young children in the group, we had to cab everyday. The money we spent cabbing could have gotten us a nicer hotel. Not to mention the time wasted traveling. We spent JPY5,000 on cabs per room per day. Conclusion, the hotel has good hardware and software. Location-wise - it's not good for travelers who are not familiar with Tokyo. Not good for people with young children. It is good for people who want peace and quiet.

However, the hotel has limited restaurants with one on the main floor that closes relatively early as well as their lounge on the 4th floor both close by 11pm. The lobby shop is extremely tiny. If you are looking for shops and restaurants I recommend either via walking 30min, taxi 5-10 or Tokyo Metro 10min-15min to go into the Ginza shopping district. You will find that Tokyo is very clean and safe. The Tokyo Metro train is very user friendly. Signage and train announcements will change from Japanese to English for ease and level of comfort for those who read/understand English. Using the train ticket dispensers are equally easy and offer a language option. It's roughly $170 JPY ($1.95 Canadian, $1.54US or $1.20 Pound Sterling) to get from the hotel to Ginza district.The hotel can provide you with umbrellas as well as maps. I also suggest to ask for a Hotel flyer that provides a map and address of the hotels location in the event you take a taxi so that the driver knows exactly where to take you back to the hotel. The front desk staff will call a taxi service for you if requested. Again I have traveled extensively around the globe and found Tokyo to be one of the cleanest and safest cities I have visited. The rooms are very clean and most toilets in the City including the hotel are Toto wet wash with seat warmer and bidet features. Rooms may vary in size - my room was compact but very functional. Note that Tokyo has strict smoking laws you cannot smoke outside unless in designated signed areas and the hotel has two smoking areas on the 3rd and 4th floors. It's a $2000 JPY fine to smoke in areas that are prohibited. .

Breakfast in hotel pricey, but right down the street was a Dotour coffee/breakfast which had great double cappuccinos and a yummy ""croque monsieur"" cheese/ham on toasted bread which we had both mornings of our stay. Just beyond the Dotour was a fabulous boulangerie (called ""bread"") on the hotel's local map - great place to pick up sandwiches to take to a National Theater performance or for our Shinkansen ride to Kyoto or bakery items for an afternoon snack. The subway stop just around the corner was very handy. We took a taxi to the train station when we left Tokyo to travel to Kyoto as we had large bags for our 3 week trip.","San Francisco, California","Cal_Travel_Lover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",97,4.0

When you are in front of the station, cross the street and go to your right side and turn the first street on your left. The hotel is after the first block.Just stayed for one night and we arrived there on a downpour day. If you haven't booked an early check-in (there is a supplement informed on their website), they do not seem to let you check-in before 2 PM. They do have a luggage room and they will store for you for free.We had a room on the sixth floor and it was compact (not good for those who have a lot of luggage - we had 2 pieces and left at the entrance of our door/bathroom) and clean but in need of a renovation (70's or 80's feel). The double-bed was 140cm large, so it is considered small for western standards. There was an empty mini-bar, a kettle, some tea bags (I don't recall them having any coffee sticks). The best thing about the room was the view. As it was raining, the view wasn't that great but at night, it looked something out of a postcard!!!!The bathroom had the best ammenities from all the hotels I have stayed. They even provided oil blotting papers!!!The breakfast was included in our rate and we had the option of having the Japanese one or western one. Honestly, it wasn't worth it. It comes with a fruit juice (not freshly squeeze), a hot drink and a toast with butter (salty) and jam on the side and an egg (small portion of scrambled egg). There is a very nice bistro-like cafe across the metro station called ""Kojimachi Cafe"" (not handicapped friendly as there is a flight of steep stairs to go their restaurant). You can have a main dish and dessert for less than 3,000 yen. It wasn't the cheapest but the quality was great and very tasty.","Nice, France","LaMediterranee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nice, France</strong>",6,4.0

My partner is notoriously known in our family for being hard to please when it comes to sleeping in anything other than his own bed, and he slept very well every night we were here. We were located up on the 13th floor and had a lovely view of the moat of the gardens to the imperial palace and a view of Tokyo Tower.Most staff we spoke to spoke English - some just very basic broken English, but this was more than enough to get through ordering food at breakfast, and they were all very polite.We ate breakfast in the restaurant in the hotel every morning, and offered 3 options for breakfast - Japanese, continental and American. The American breakfast probably isn't what you normally would expect it to be and probably a lot smaller, but we really enjoyed what was offered. We ate in this restaurant once for lunch and dinner and the food was lovely.The nearest station is Hanzomon Metro station which is about a 2 minute walk down the road. Although it doesn't offer a direct route to Tokyo station but you only have to change lines for 1 stop and then your there and didn't take long at all.Although not something you probably look for in a hotel - we were there during a big earthquake in November 2016 (I think 7.3 on the richter scale) and the building did sway and creeked a bit but all was good!If we were to ever visit Japan again I would not hesitate to stay here again.","London, United Kingdom","xxxEmzy1988xxx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",11,5.0

Its geographical location is, to be positive, on the quiet side and at least equally inconvenient for all the far-flung Tokyo sights (with the exception of the Imperial Palace gardens). Its food is unremarkable but perfectly acceptable. No, what makes this hotel so special and worthy of a review is the stunning night-time view. Like the ""framed-picture"" garden at Adachi, the sight of Maranouchi lit up at night with the Palace moat in the foreground framed by the large windows is sensational.

Our main criteria were room size, cost, location and room quality. From our research we found that a lot of the hotels in our price range seemed to have very similar rooms sizes and layouts. No matter where you go, the rooms in Tokyo are going to be small. Once we had resigned ourselves to a small room, we concentrated on our other criteria.We went for a western style room, we were on the 9th floor with a view over the Imperial Palace gardens. This view was a good selling point for us, although because of the angle you really just see a load of trees as the Palace itself is out of sight. Still, it was a nice view when the sun was out. The room was, as expected, small, but we made the most of it. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed wasn't as small as we were expecting. The bathroom was nice. A fairly powerful and hot shower, and a nice Japanese style toilet that my fiancé loved.The reception staff were courteous, helpful and spoke good English. The 24 hour reception was a plus point as we arrived late to check in. They were also happy to take delivery of a Japanese a SIM card for us before we arrived.We had booked breakfast with our room, which came as a choice of Japanese style and American style. The Japanese style was tried once and involved rice and fish based items. Wasn't really our cup of tea first thing in the morning! The American style involved eggs, potato things (like hash browns) and ham/bacon (although Japanese 'bacon' is slightly different to American/British, still tasty though).The location of the hotel is fantastic. It's less than a 5 minute walk to the Hanzomon line subway station, and is very central to the main tourist points in Tokyo. Next to the station there is a convenience store with very good Japanese style food, along with a couple of restaurants.All in all very happy with our stay at Grand Arc.

As others have said, it is next to the Imperial Palace, however the entrance to it is on the other side of the lake but still an enjoyable walk. When I checked in I was glad I brought my paperwork with me as I knew no Japanese and the staff that helped me at the time had very basic English skills. That being said, you are checking into a hotel, so most things could be figured out and they were able to provide me a English map of locations near the hotel.The subway is one block away and because of that I did not use a taxi or anything for my trip. There are many local like restaurants and personally I did not use them as I went to the quick eat locations that were also near by. The other major point for myself is that the location was very quiet. After a long day in Tokyo it was nice to be able to come ""home"" to a peaceful place to sleep.I used the hotel restaurant a couple of times for breakfast and overall it was a very good American style breakfast and the service was excellent. I am used to American portion size and it was not close to that but I was not expecting that either. The room sizes as expected were also small but well furnished with a mini refrigerator Because of that fridge I brought a fair amount of snacks and the like back to my room. My only major downside that I had with the hotel is a lack of self-service laundry. The hotel tried to help again with the map in English but I made other plans and if I had the funds I could have used the hotels full service laundry.The hotel wifi was, as many hotel wifi's, slow at best, to the point I just used the personal Mifi that I rented for my trip.Last thing that I want to point out is that the hotel seems to read the comment cards.

We already communicated with the hotel ahead of our stay and received fast and helpful responses.We easily found the hotel. When arriving with heavy luggage you do not need to worry as the Hanzomon station has an elevator. Just follow the signs. If you wish to have the shortest way to the hotel you should take the first or second exit (stairs only, no elevator for these exits).The check-in was fast and uncomplicated. The staff spoke English very well so we had no issues. With our room keys we also received the password for the free Wi-Fi so we didn't need to request this.The lobby was welcoming and very neat. If you need a mail box, you can find it in the lobby next to the front desk. You can also get stamps from the staff of the front desk. Once we arrived in our room (normal double room, non-smoking) we were very pleased. The room is big enough for two people and comes with a bed that is about 1.40m wide (and quite hard), a desk with chair, an additional chair and a little coffee table. Furthermore a small fridge, an eletric kettle with tee bags and a hair dryer are available. The bathroom is also big enough and equiped with everything you need including a shaver and a comb. The best detail regarding the room was the amazing view. Even the smallest room does come with a big window. In our case we were able to see the Imperial Palace garden and the Tokyo Tower. Really amazing! We left the curtain open at night to enjoy the city view.And don't worry because of the bigger street in front of the hotel. You will definitely not hear it. It is very quiet at night. Also every floor offers a vending machine so you can get cold drinks very easily. Just bring a few coins as they don't work with Suica or Pasmo cards. We had breakfast at the hotel only once and ordered the Japanese breakfast. The breakfast is a set menu and you can only choose between Japanese, Continental and Western. The Japanese breakfast was okay and rich. We additionally ordered coffee which was quite expensive (around ¥600) and was only a small cup and quite bitter. Overall we were not fully satisfied with the breakfast and therefore decided to not eat at the restaurant again. Furthermore we did not test the other restaurants that are connected to the hotel.The area around the hotel is very nice. You can find convenience stores near the hotel where you can shop 24 hours a day. There's also a nice cafe with connected bookstore at the entrance of the Hanzomon Station. If you love to jog in the morning you can take the beautiful route around the Imperial Palace. Especially on weekends this seems to be a popular route. Overall we were very satisfied with the hotel. The room was big enough for the two of us. If you stay longer you should keep in mind that there is no real wardrobe in the room (at least not in the smallest available category we stayed in). Only a small open wardrobe with 4 to 5 hangers. So you will need to keep most clothes in your suitcases. Still we would highly recommend this hotel as it is quite cheap with a perfect location and view. The service was excellent.

If you aren't already convinced google ""Grand Arc Hanzomon Views"" or look at the fabulous pictures posted on this Tripadvisor section. It's worth it for the view alone. The only reason I've given this place a 4/5 is strictly because of the location. It's not near any decent shops, and you have to walk quite far to the main train stations. It was kind of confusing being first time Japan travellers, and the only reason I wouldn't stay here again is because next time I want to be more central. However, I think being away from the main city helped a lot when it came to working out the trains and the overall feel of Tokyo. If you're going here for the first time, or want a relaxing holiday as opposed to being in the center of the city, then go here.

Had to duck a bit but no biggy. As for the beds. If you like a firm bed, it is, firm. Firmer than what I was expecting but I had an awesome sleep & my back actually felt great. A couple of times we ate at the restaurant on the main floor for breakfast & once for dinner. You pay more but to be expected when eating from the hotel. Around $12 for breakfast. The staff were awesome to deal with. One of the staff members there, Takashi Okuaki was very helpful. We enjoyed having little conversation with him. His understanding & speaking of English wasn't too bad. Actually the staff from check-in & the restaurant were the same. Decent basic knowledge.Our rooms everyday were very clean & bathroom amenities were topped up (razors, toothbrushes, etc.)Our room was facing out towards the Imperial Palace and we could also see the Tokyo Tower from our room as well.As for smoking, I'm not too sure on the rooms. I went outside to the front of the hotel to have a cigarette.Two minute walk to visit Imperial Palace gardens, (if you're curious about walking around the perimeter of the Imperial Palace, it's 5km or 3 miles).Three minute walk to Hanzomon station. If you want to go to the Tokyo Skytree, get on the Hanzomon line & take it almost to the end. One train, 15-20 minutes & you're there.You can take the Hanzomon line with a connecting line to get to Shibuya (10-15 mins), Shinjuku (next stop north of Shibuya), or Akihabara (10-15 mins)On the other side of the Imperial Palace grounds from the hotel (20-30 min. walk) is Tokyo station (main train station), where you can get the JR bullet train or the other line of bullet trains, if you're going to Osaka, Kyoto, or Hiroshima. In my opinion the hotel has everything that we needed. The staff are friendly, the service was great, the hotel & the rooms were very clean, and the room size was cozy & decent.

All places we stayed at in Japan were so refreshing and amazing so maybe our bar was higher when we checked in here. This seemed like a confused combination of modern and traditional Japan. The view from the room was amazing - we could see Tokyo tower from our window however, getting to the window was a battle. The room is tiny and poorly organized. I had to spend some time moving the furniture around just to be able to put our backpacks somewhere. There is absolutely no moving space in the room, you enter and then just stand there before you can figure out where to put your foot next. Once rearranged, it was better. The next problem was no tea/coffee in the room - only Japanese tea. This was surprising. We had stayed at some very traditional place in the west of Japan and even there, we had access to coffee and tea with cream and sugar. And there excuse for not having these in the room was that they were doing the traditional Japanese green tea. Maybe this was not such a big deal, but being able to get a hot cup of tea or coffee in the room is a luxury that I like to enjoy on my travel. The location is pretty convenient - you can walk to the Honzomon station and connect to anywhere on the subway which is nice. Overall, I would recommend staying here if you are seeing cheap rates, if not, look for something else - there is nothing that made this place stand out for me.

With a view to travelling around Tokyo and then taking the bullet train out to some of the more rural regions in Japan, we were looking for somewhere quite central. You could say whichever district you stay in in Tokyo, you are central, due to such a fantastic underground network. On this occasion, we opted for the Hanzomon district.Situated right next to the imperial palace, this 17 story building is a real gem of a hotel. We were given a very friendly, hassle-free reception on both our arrival and departure. The room was perfect for what we needed, albeit slightly on the small side. We chose a non-smoking twin room, which comprised: a double bed, table and chair, floor lamp, tv, hairdryer, dressing table/desk area, small alcove for clothing, bedside table and telephone, bathroom (with shower over bath, sink, toilet with numerous functionality (hours of fun pressing all of these and filming our reactions!)). The alcove also served as a space for storing one suitcase, though because of the general space limitations, the other suitcase had to be left in the middle of the floor.We were up on the 10th floor, so had a pretty amazing view over Hanzomon. You can opt for a view over the imperial palace gardens, though we didn't feel we missed out by not having this.My only gripe with the room was the bed and pillows. It took quite a few days into our two week holiday to achieve a good nights sleep. Not only because of the jet lag, but because the bed was hard and the cushions were almost 'crunching' under our heads. Other than that I really can't complain about the room.We dined at the Patio restaurant in the hotel many times during our stay for both breakfast and our evening meals. Dining in Japan is like doing Bushtucker trials(!), so eating at the hotel was a safe bet, plus the food was absolutely lovely. Quite often we had the continental breakfast in the morning. For dinner, I'd recommend the Beef Steak in Teriyaki sauce. Mouthwatering! The service was also fantastic. Everyone is extremely pleasant and accommodating. They couldn't thank you enough for your custom. There was one particular waiter (hoping I have his name correct - Okuaki), who always had a smile from ear to ear and couldn't do enough to help. At one point I caught a bad cold during the holiday, so requested some hot water with honey and lemon. They promptly obliged (after showing them a Google translation on my partners phone to assist with the language barrier) and didn't even charge us for the privilege! In terms of the hotels location, it's only a two minute walk to the nearest underground station, which was ideal for us. Hanzomon itself errs on the side of being more of a business district, so isn't thriving with bars, nightclubs or restaurants. But with such a lovely hotel restaurant, and the ability to hop onto the underground at any time, we really couldn't complain.

Doesn't have all the amenities that a luxury property should have. That being said, it is not a dive by any means. The pros, great location. Just down the street from the Hanzomon subway station, across the street from the Imperial Palace Gardens, practically beside the National Theater. They have very fast wifi. Both my wife and I were running netflix of their wifi without issue. Size of the room we got was reasonable. Not North American huge but for Japan, it was bigger than most places.The cons, we wanted a massage but none was to be had. No convenience stores nearby. In fact, you had to go back to the subway station to buy a bottle of water. There are very little restaurants nearby. You will see lots of dignitaries and VIP's and their entourage running around blocking off elevators.

Visited Senso-Ji temple, Meiji Shrine, Shibuya Crossing and the Kachiko statue, all well worth seeing.

We chose the Grand Arc Hanzomon as it's near Tokyo Station (10 minute cab ride). The Hotel is near the Imperial palace Grounds and located in a quiet area of office buildings as well as being next to the national theater. The hotels has 17 floors which offer a great view of the Imperial Palace Park, a beautiful tree filled green expanse in the middle of Tokyo. We were lucky and had booked a deal getting us the Grand Arc Suite on the 17th floor. it was a lovely space with real closets, a nice sitting area and a twin bedded bedroom. The Bathroom was very nice with a Japanese Bath and Shower system as well as a separate WC.It was a nicely equipped room with a tea kettle in the foyer wet bar area complete wiith teas and a fridge, air purifiers in each room and free wifi.However, service is a bit lacking. We arrived and there was no bell help or cart to help us with all our bags (I was traveling with extra suitcases that had accommodated gifts from the US and would soon be filled with Gifts from Japan for the return).They had a laundry service which seemed very regular. I was expecting them to be placed in my room, but getting in very late from dinner, I found a message on the phone that asked me to come down to the desk and pick up my laundry. Not terrible, but not the service that one expects when staying at a nice hotel.On our departure, we were once again struggling to get our (now filled ) bags out of the hotel to a cab. Once outside the front entrance, we saw a uniformed man and a man in a suit standing at attention. When we asked for a cab, they notified us that we would d have to walk to the nearest main thoroughfare and try to hail one outrrselves. They stood at attention and watched us struggle by. We did find a cab after walking 3 blocks.it was a nice hotel, clean, well kept and in a very nice area. Just because its perceived as a business hotel, it doesn't mean that the extra added bits of service should be forgotten.

The lazy man said that he did not know and did not even bother to find out. I blatantly told him to go research online and he finally obliged. It appears that common sense is not so common anymore. Obviously, basic level of customer service was greatly lacking. After that, we went back to the room. Called front desk to request for a weighing scale via the phone. The smart aleck receptionist, Yamamoto kept asking me to repeat like a fool when his competency level of english sucks. After several times of repeating myself and he did not understand, I requested to be put to another person. Finally the front desk supervisor (a female) took over the call and told me that he does not speak english well. If that is the case, it is common sense for him to transfer the phone call immediately and not treat a guest like a fool and ask her to repeat several times. Service was so bad that even a budget hotel chain like hotel mystays is significanly better. The pillow was uncomfortable. Reception was old and dim. Only saving grace was the view from the room. After speaking to the front desk manager and general manager (the general manager could not even speak basic level of english), I am very certain that this hotel caters to japanese business guests.

It was the perfect starting point to explore the city, and a great, comfortable sanctuary after a busy day. The rooms are larger-than-average by Tokyo standards, although still relatively compact to European or American expectations. We opted for a twin room, which based on images seems to have slightly more space than the basic double rooms. The style is bright, fresh and clean, making the rooms very inviting. Aside from the two large twin beds, we also had a small seating area with a coffee table, and a small entrance hall which boasted a vanity mirror and stool along with the sizeable wardrobe. The beds were firm but comfortable. From the 15th floor, the views across the city with Tokyo Tower in the centre were spectacular, especially once night fell. The TV was easy to use and navigate (something of a rarity in Japan!) and the bathroom was quite basic, but fit to purpose and equipped each day with a full gambit of toiletries. The AC worked a treat and was very powerful. We didn't eat at any of the restaurants, but we sampled La Mer lounge for drinks one evening. It had a very pleasant, more-formal atmosphere and lovely views. Service was great and the prices, though slightly higher than other bars in the city, were still relatively cheap when compared with European hotel bar prices. Guests here are just a couple of minutes walk from Hanzomon subway station, meaning you can get anywhere in the city exceptionally easily. There isn't a great deal to see or do in the immediate area - a few restaurants, convenience stores and a nice cafe for a cheap breakfast before setting out for the day. For those who plan on exploring, I'd totally recommend buying a PASMO card from the subway station for Y500 - you can top it up as needed and it works on all public transport, so you don't need to worry about the price of each single train trip. You can also use it on subway vending machines and in convenience stores, plus it worked on the subway in Kyoto and also on the Kyoto tramline! For every tourist I saw struggling with the prices on the tube map, I really wanted to go and tell them to opt for a PASMO instead. The front desk staff were very helpful and efficient and helped us with a number of questions about services and directions. The clientelle of the hotel definitely seemed more business-like, and I felt a little awkward negotiating around the well-dressed salarymen in shorts and a t-shirt, but considering the low price we paid and the high quality of the hotel I'd absolutely recommend tourists to make this their base of operations.","London, United Kingdom","Bubblebeard</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",68,4.0

It was good value, a la carte, although a buffet would be my preference.Please take good notice of what I have to say about the location. You will not be in the centre of activities, like the bustling Shibuya or right in the middle of Shinjuku. But u will find yourself with the peace and tranquility area near the Imperial Palace. Like a quiet oasis right in the middle of busy Tokyo.So it really suited us as we like an early morning walk right around the palace moat, wonderful and blissful 1.5 hours it took us.Yet, u are so close to Hanzomon subway station, which will whisk you to anywhere in Tokyo in next to no time. There are many good restaurants nearby. We love Indian food that is halal and we can recommend Siddique (just walk south once out of Hanzomon exit 1) and Mother India around the corner north east of exit 1. There are a variety of other nice restaurants too. The neighbourhood is very peaceful.I think we found the perfect location in Tokyo.","Melbourne, Australia","hajijohn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",66,5.0

So if you're limited for space you can use a very small overnight bag and save the space for your clothes. We were staying the night before a cruise so didn't have to open the large cases.Very impressed - would definitely stay again.The area was very nice and quiet. Opposite the imperial palace, near the British embassy.The Japanese people were very helpful and although most didn't speak a lot of English they always tried to help, (most spoke a little English).The only thing we had any real problems with was trying to buy train/metro tickets - we found the system very complicated and were never sure which machine to get the tickets from. We almost always had to ask. It seems to be different line different machine.

My adult offspring shared a triple traditional Japanese style room which was not so spacious and involved putting the Japanese beds away during the day; there was also a not so pleasant smell in this room, which we attributed to the bamboo matting on which the mattresses were placed for sleeping. We ate in the restaurant on two nights, due to Typhoon Vongfong preventing us from eating out; the menu was a bizarre mix of Japanese and Western dishes including a number of German choices and between the five of us we tried several different dishes which were all pretty decent. Be aware however that the restaurant closes quite early in Western terms so we were unable to order dessert on the first night as it had gone past 21:30. We also ate breakfast in the hotel on all three mornings and again they had a decent selection of Japanese and western choices such as fried or scrambled eggs on toast with ham or bacon but strangely garnished with carrot and cauliflower! The hotel is only a five minute walk to the metro station and there is also a convenience store, a couple of restaurants and a good French bakery in the same area.

Also the hotel do not do room service (do not make the mistake i did and order a Dominoes pizza on your own online to the hotel- got back late and was starving- this didnt go down well with reception but they let me off the one time haha)Overall pro's out weigh the cons, hotel is great, view from the room was awesome- never got bored of it.

Located on the west side next to the imperial palace, the closest station to the hotel is the Hanzomon Metro Station. As soon as you exit Hanzomon it is a two minute walk to the left (east).We had booked a Deluxe Twin room (highly reccommended) and they immediately got our reservation and withing 5 mins and making the payment we got our keys to the room. The room was huge by Tokyo standards with a spacious living area, great bath (wet bath so water will flow out and drain on floor as they do in Japan), we receieved the standard slippers and robe as well as a welcome pack explaining the hotel and what to do. We had breakfast included so we received breakfast coupons as well.The room had plenty of supplies as in shampoo, soap etc and upon request they would give us what we needed. The TV had free channels plus the option of some pay channels that required a 1000yen top up card to slot in the TV, they show for free for around 2 mins then require the top up card. These pay channels were basically more up to date movies and porn channels :pThen again when in Tokyo why bother sitting around watching TV.Room service was brilliant, they clean up the room top to bottom, (other than under the actual bed, which was a bit dusty, but im nit picking) and replenished the shampoo etc.The breakfast itself was a set menu containing 3 american style breakfasts and one Japanese breakfast. I had to have only the Japanese breakfast as I do no eat meat, only fish, the breakfast though was very well made and tasted wonderful. They are very strict with timings though and breakfast was from 0700 to 0930. Outside food in there is a no no, but that is to be expected, you can however bring in and eat whatever you want in your room.The staff were by far the best part, they were extremely helpful with local directions and amenities, and especially when helping us find our way on first and last train to Kyoto for the day.Also when leaving they organised a taxi to take us back to Tokyo station to get the Narita express for Narita airport.The general warm feeling from staff made the whole trip feel great.Location is great, right next to the imperial palace, the general area is quite quiet, right near Hanzomon Metro station.The only thing is to get to the main districts eg. Asakusa, Akihabara, Shibuya, Shinguku, take maybe one or two connections, but as Hanzomon is so central it takes under 20 mins or less to get to the further destinations.Great staff and service, clean room with great view and space (Deluxe Twin room), great breakfast though slightly limited and great locationWould highly reccommend to any first time travellers to Japan, will definitely look to book again for my next visit!!","London, United Kingdom","Faharbitraitor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",28,5.0

Going for a run around the palace is a delight.Drawbacks:The only reason I can see for the prices being relatively low is the metro connection. The hotel is only a 3 minute walk from the Hanzomon metro station. The Hanzomon line terminates in Shibuya, but other than that it's not extremely well connected to other popular lines, notably the JR lines. And if you have big bags to carry, the Hanzomon line has a lot of steps to manage.My solution was to pay a ~15$ taxi ride to Tokyo Station and connect to the underground from there.The area is a little quiet at night, but you'll find a restaurant.

However, generally well maintained.The good, 12th floor and probably others are smoke free, we stayed in room 1213 a Japanese style room rated for three people but it would have been tight. Quite comfortable for the two of us. Very, close 150 feet to the National Theater which is why we picked it. Two longish blocks from exit # 1 of the Hanzomon Station on the Hanzomon Subway Line. We were there on a weekend and only the Patio Resturant was open, good food but not great. The lunch pasta for 830 yen is best avoided unless you like your pasta well past al dente. Dinner is moderately priced and while not Haute Cuisine it is acceptable. I can not speak for the two resturants that were closed one is Washoku style food and the other is tempura.Room thermostat actually works a pet peeve of mine, and the sound of the fan is very low and will not disturb the lightest sleeper.Good view of the southern section of the palace moat, some of the palace grounds, Tokyo Tower, National Diet Building and the roof of the National Theater from our room. However, specify that you want a palace side room as the other wing has a view of a dreary part of the city.Excellent place to stay if you have buisness with the government as it is two stops from Nagatacho, and the National Diet Library, Diet Offices and Supreme Court of Japan. Also it is about 2 blocks to the south of the British Embassy, and 5-6 blocks from Chigoridafuji (The tomb of the Unknown Soldiers) and one subway stop from Yasukuni Shrine.The bad, if you are coming in from out of town and not familiar with the subways it is a $12.00 taxi fare from Tokyo Station, also exit 1 from Hanzomon Station has no escalator and you are a good 3 stories underground a major hike with luggage. The elevator drops you somewhere about 3 blocks west of the British Embassy, look for the flag, walk towards it and when you reach the palace moat turn right and go for another couple of blocks. I suggest not trying it if you are not familiar with Tokyo. I did not spot a lot of taxis except for those in front of the hotel. There was a very good supply of amenities in the room, but the lobby shop does not carry anything except gift items that I saw. There is a convenience store two blocks to the west catty corner from the subway exit though. Beer is available in the hotel vending machines along with a large assortment of soda all at reasonable prices.Basically it is a very upscale business hotel and probably does a huge business during the week when the government offices are open.Nothing really bad though, and the price is right we stayed for $220 including breakfast which is quite reasonable for central Tokyo in a hotel of this caliber.","La Mesa, California","Ted C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Mesa, California</strong>",249,4.0

I was correct because later Booking.com emailed me to say that the hotel waived the penalty.The next night we had dinner in their restaurant and I told the wait staff that I had a headache. Maybe they called him because after 5 minutes, Mr. Nakafuji was there to rescue me saying maybe it was the sake. The view from expectedly the best because it was the Grand Arc Suite. But my boys room was not and they also have the same view.The hotel amenities were overflowing. I liked that they gave us fresh night clothes to wear. Everything was clean and new. The toilet was scary because we are not used to using smart toilets that have lids that open and close by themselves whenever we enter and leave. After a while, I began to appreciate it especially because the toilet seat was heated! The vendo and ice machines were located near our room, plus I appreciate the fact that the ref didnt have anything in it because we like to fill up our ref with various food and fruits we find whenever we go around. Tomorrow we are moving to the Capitol Hotel. We booked 2 different hotels because one of the hotels can't take us in for 2 weeks (fully booked). I am definitely going to miss the view! Thanks, GAH!

Access to all major transport hubs is easy due to its proximity to the Hanzomon metro station. For directions to the hotel, simply refer to the hotel's website. However, note that if you travel with a lot of luggage a taxi might be a good option; otherwise be prepared to carry all your belongings up some flight of stairs as the Hanzomon station doesn't have any elevators.Unfortunately we weren't given a room with a good view (be it that all rooms facing the Imperial Garden were taken or we booked a semi-double). However, our room was clean, well-appointed and comfortable. Yes, it was small (with the bed 120cm) but no complaint since we were aware of it's size at the time of booking.Breakfast in the Patio restaurant was good as well (starting from 740 Yen for a Western breakfast with free refill for coffee and tea).

There was space between the bed and the window, giving us a place to put our giant American luggage. I could actually sit at the desk. And the bathroom was larger-than-average, and looked more like a ""real bathroom"" than a plastic phone booth.The view from the window was incredible; a chunk of the Imperial Palace garden and part of the south of Tokyo. It was really nice and made the room much more pleasant.I see other reviewers have had problems with getting a non-smoking room, but that was not my experience.

I also see from other reviews, and this does bear mentioning, that while the Grand Arc Hanzomon is very close to the Imperial Palace, it is on the opposite side of the Imperial Palace from Tokyo Station, which makes it not ideally suited for public transportation as no train lines go directly under the palace - they either detour north or south.The Hanzomon station of the Tokyo Metro's Hanzomon line is a block away, but the Hanzomon line doesn't really connect to anything a tourist would want to see, so one takes it a stop South to Akasaka-Mitsuke for a connection, which involves a lot of walking as the ""connection"" is really walking 100-300m underground to a nearby metro station. One can also walk a little more or less than a kilometer to get to the stations to the west or south of the hotel which are on much more useful lines.

This means smoking room with air freshener.They really need to increase the number of non-smoking rooms. According to statistics, only 20% of Japanese smoke today. So why are most rooms smoking?2. Staff need to get a bit more flexible.

The hotel is located in the buisiness district and is a close to the Hanzamon line subway.

The rooms were small and so were the beds & bathrooms, but it was fine if you just want to use it as a base. The views were lovely - we had overlooking the park and the theatre. My biggest issue was the very unhelpful and rather insolent staff in form of a male recepsionist. Firstly when i called down to inquire about options of getting to the airport he respnded ""train"". I asked if the limobus which i had read about was in service and he replied ""no. Train"" and hung up. I thought maybe he just couldn't understand or didn't speak english very well. He proved me wrong when I later that day went to reception to inform them that my partner had lost both his phone and camera earlier on the trip and that the police might contact the hotel with information. Before I was even able to explain or say what I had come to say the male receptionist interrupted and said it was a matter for the police. After 15 minutes of me trying to get through that I wanted to know was whether the police had been in contact or if there was anything more we could do, I had to give up out of sheer frustration and annoyance at the receptionist. He even went as far as to scournfully laugh at me for not getting the name of the police officer ( I had the policeform with reffrence number etc).

From the outside it looked impressive enough, and the location close to the Imperial Palace gardens was very attractive. However, I was told that check in was not for another 3 hours and my room was not available. My complaints, saying I was exhausted and needed to rest were met with polite inscrutability, but no real attempt to help. I could not believe there were NO rooms that had been made up and that was confirmed when a colleague who also arrived early was able to go straight to his room. I asked if there was a lounge where I could sit in a comfortable chair with a soft drink, but there was none, only restaurants. The lobby only had a few uncomfortable chairs and a leather bench, which is where I ended up crashing out until my room was ready.Once I got to my 10th floor room, the only impressive part was the view. The room itself was small and the furnishings were basic; the bathroom was more of a cupboard, measuring approximately 5ft by 6ft. The bed was hard and uncomfortable. There was no mini bar and no soft drinks were available in the room, nor could I find any room service menu. The TV was exclusively Japanese- no CNN or Sky News. WiFi was free, but slow, so I resorted to the high speed ethernet connection which was good, offering a robust connectivity. Food in the restaurants was unremarkable. No gym or pool.Whilst the overall entrance to the hotel gave an impression of a mid-range standard hotel that would boast most of the expected amenities, but the accommodation and services were more like those of a low budget motel. Judging from the guests when I was there, the hotel is clearly geared to Japanese business travellers and, in my opinion, little concession is made to western travellers, although the service was always exceedingly polite and attentive, as one would expect in Japan. This is very different from my previous experiences with other hotels in Tokyo and I was therefore very surprised and disappointed.I will not use this hotel again.","Macclesfield, United Kingdom","Adriano53</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Macclesfield, United Kingdom</strong>",51,3.0

As mentioned in many reviews the metro line Hanzomon station is only a couple of minutes away although the elevator for the station is eight minutes or so away. There are many convenience stores and restaurants nearby. The hotel has wedding ceremony and reception halls, banquet rooms up to the sixth floor. There are four restaurants on the premise, La Mer French restaurant on the forth floor, Hagoromo Tempura on the second floor, Mon Japanese in the basement and Patio Western café on the ground floor. I did not visit La Mer but had breakfast and lunch at Mon and Patio. We had dinner at Hagoromo. Mon and Patio were quite busy during lunch time. Hagoromo's tempura was quite good and the price was not bad at all for a restaurant in a hotel managed by the Imperial Hotel.Our room was spacious with a large window. It had a closet with a space to hung clothes and drawers, an extra sink, a writing table with a TV and a set for tea with a small fridge, drawers and a safe underneath, a chair and a coffee table and a trouser presser. There is a coin laundry in the neighborhood.We were very happy and understood why Grand Arc Hanzomon was selected at the top on the best budget hotels in Japan by TA.",Albuquerque NM,"Tangarini</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albuquerque NM</strong>",51,5.0

We stayed in a semi double room and a twin room. Both rooms had really large windows with a great view towards the river and the imperial palace, also one of the rooms had an excellent view of the Tokyo Tower. Our rooms were very clean (spotless), comfortable and had everything we needed including a full complement of toiletries.The room had a small fridge and to be honest the room was a much better size than we expected. The twin room was larger but you do pay a higher price for that space, the semi double was adequate. We are travelling for a while so have 2 large suitcases, these were stored against the wall and didn't get in our way. We did keep most things in the suitcases though rather than scatter everything around the room.The aircon was very good and the in room internet access was fast and reliable.The hotel is really accessible via the metro, on the Hanzomon line you go to the Hanzomon station - the closest exit to the hotel is exit number 1 - bear in mind this exit has stairs only, exit 5 has a lift - using exit 5 is a longer walk to the hotel but only about 5 minutes in total. Using exit number 1 you literally cross the road, take the first left and walk for about 2 minutes - the Grand Arc will be on the right hand side.The reception staff are very helpful and spoke enough English to understand our questions. The hotel will also store luggage, which is secure and they give you a tag so you can make sure you get the right luggage back. They stored our bags for us overnight.The location of the hotel was excellent, it was very quiet and only about a 15 minute walk to the entrance for the Imperial Palace gardens. The Hanzomon line is one of the main tokyo metro lines so it makes all the tourist attractions really easily accessible such as Akihibara (electric technology town), Asakusa for the Sensoji Temple and Skytree, Shibuya for the pedestrian crossing as well as Tokyo station for the JR train lines and Shinkansen.There is also a Lawsons, Family Mart and Sun Rus convenience stores close to the metro station about a 3/4 minute walk from the hotel.All in all we really did enjoy our stay - for the location, comfort and cleanliness. We would stay here again and definitely recommend it.","England, United Kingdom","y0dagreen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>England, United Kingdom</strong>",153,5.0

And it's in one of the quietest spots I've ever been in Tokyo because it's so close to the Imperial Palace. It's got such a nice view of Tokyo Tower at night, and it's close to several stations.  The Hanzomon Line is very convenient because it takes you right to Sky Tree and also right to Shibuya which gets you just about anyplace else in Tokyo. Hotel staff speaks English though most of my interactions with them were limited and I usually just used Japanese. Don't forget to visit the Imperial Palace while you're here! You're so close!

They are small compared to western standards but at the end of the day it's a nice room, well kept and a place to crash after long days of exploring Tokyo with great views of the imperial gardens and the city. I feel that I should mention that the hotel is in the middle of a business district so you might feel a little out of place when you're dressed in sneakers and jeans (to walk around the city all day) and almost everyone else around you is wearing suits but this really didn't bother me too much.

Bathrooms are not large but are adequate, and come equipped with an all-singing, all-dancing Japanese toilet: if you don't know what this is, you're in for a surprise.The Grand Arc Hanzomon is not right in the centre of frenetic Tokyo, but to me that was an advantage: it is two minutes' walk from Hanzomon Metro stop on the Hanzomon Line, so Ginza or the other major centres are no more than 15 or 20 minutes away.Staff are uniformly extremely courteous and helpful, as only the Japanese can be, although in some instances I encountered a language barrier with restaurant staff, whose command of English was rudimentary.I felt that breakfast was the weak link in an otherwise perfect stay: it is rather unimaginative and limited, but I have to admit that there are plenty of places nearby where one can get breakfast.The Grand Arc Hanzomon is not a ""grand"" hotel in the style of the Imperial, the Okura or the New Otani, but those hotels have the disadvantage that they are swarming with people and are often confusing in layout (the New Otani especially). I like the restrained atmosphere at the Hanzomon, although it can be busy at weekends when it becomes a popular venue for weddings.All in all, I am delighted to have found this hotel, and will be very happy to return there on my next visit to Tokyo.","Seville, Spain","felipeordonez</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seville, Spain</strong>",157,5.0

So we left to the city early Sunday morning and came back late night to a palace view room with all our stuff already there.The room is small if measured in American way, but was good enough for us even with two big cases and two carry-ons in the room. The palace view is super in the morning with beautiful sunrise to wake up with and splendid view at night.

Check-in was quick and painless, just the way it should be after a 10 hour flight and 1.5 hour train/subway ride. About the hotel:- Staff were very friendly and helpful- Great location- Super clean ( like most things in Japan)- Nice rooms and washrooms- Free Internet access but bring a long cable if you want to lie in bed. No wireless.- As others have said, walk to one of teh bakeries nearby and enjoy a nice cup of tea/coffee and a freshly baked pastry instead of eating at the hotel.- The price is right for downtown Tokyo ( I paid $114/night on Bookit)The hotel is located a few steps from the Honzomon subway station. As others have mentioned, this particular subway station does not have escalators at the exits and you will have to carry your bags up three flights of stairs. Make sure you take exit #1 or you will have a longer walk.I toured the city on foot/subway/train/monorial for three days. Buy a full day unlimited subway pass (~$10) and you will be all set. There are two subway companies in Tokyo, but the ""Tokyo Subway"" has the most lines. In some cases you will have to pay a few extra dollars to transfer from one line to another. The machines to buy tickets all have an ""english"" button and subway staff all speak some english. Take advantage of the central location of the hotel to come back in the afternoon for a quick nap!There is a great Indian restaurant near the hotel called Dimpmahal. Try their Thali which was delicious and only 1500 yen.I had many great inexpensive meals all over the city.If you are there on a Sunday, make sure you check out the ""temple sales"" which are basically the Japanese version of our garage sales. there is a complete listing on Google.","Mississauga, Canada","dds60</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mississauga, Canada</strong>",60,5.0

Quiet location, rooms are small (but standard for Japanese hotels) and we made it work with two suitcases and a little furniture re-arrangement. Very close to the Hanzomon subway line, where you can get direct access to Shibuya and Shinjuku. Views from the hotel room was fabulous! Very safe feeling walking around late at nightStaff there spoke fairly good english and we were treated well (no concierge in the hotel but that was not a problem) A few things to note:- i) Japanese subways at different stations sometimes do not have elevators or lifts that take you to street level so pack prudently or carry a backpack instead of a suitcase-makes it easier to move around. ii) If you are carrying luggage, book the rearmost seat on the Shinkansen as you can put your baggage behind you, against the rear bulkhead wall. Luggage storage space is at a premium on those trains so reserve your seat early on. iii) To get to Grand Arc from Narita, I'd suggest catching the Narita Express to Tokyo and then the subway-we took another (at the time seemed a more direct route) which I believe took us longer to get there. iv) Have your breakfast outside, there are quite a few French inspired patisseries around with fantastic breads and pastries for your morning breakfast (and cheaper too)Overall, very good value for money!","Brisbane, Australia","Perks2508</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",7,4.0

The location is excellent particularly for me, who needs good food. There are a few good places for breakfast near by and for dinner there are various good quality restaurants around the hotel and near the nearest underground station ""Hanzomon"".

You would jogg along the way passing by the National Museum of Modern Art, the British Embassy, the National Theatre, which is right next to the hotel.

Really well located as well as its a minute walk from the Hanzomen subway line (which is only 4 or 5 stops from Shibuya).The room - we had a front facing room so like many of the pictures had an amazing view every morning over to the park and the city skyline.

Could translate instructions for me ( I bought Baseball tickets and couldn't work out when the game started) and the staff also really help us by booking a cabin on the 7th station of mount fuji (which took about ten mins of their time).

We were very pleased we did so. Like most of Japan, it‘s super clean although the room was small by Western standards. As we had requested, we were provided with a non-smoking room on a high floor over-looking the Imperial Garden. What a fabulous night time view that included Tokyo Tower all lit up. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful at all times including our late evening check-in. With a side trip to Kyoto in the middle of our stay, the staff was happy to store our suitcases so we could just travel with our small bags. Their consideration extended to booking us in the same room both times which made it easier to acclimatize. The soaps, shampoo and conditioner were all very nice. You get two bags of green tea and two of black tea every day. The small water heating pot was the only thing I would change. A kettle would have been nicer. The hotel Business Center has a good map of Tokyo that’s different from the airport one. While there is no wi-fi in the rooms, the hotel provides a LAN cable. This gave us excellent, reliable internet access. Try walking across the street along the Imperial Palace moat. You will see a small play ground, and lots of people jogging, etc. It’s lovely and hooks you up to Kitanomaru Park in about 20 minutes. We walked back from Ginza one day which took us about 45 minutes. Make sure you book your free tour of the Imperial Gardens on-line. It was so easy to get around the city on the metro from Hanzomon.Getting there from the Airport: First pick up a Tokyo Map and a Subway Map at the Airport Information desk in the arrival lobby. I think the easiest way to get to the hotel is to purchase SUICA cards at the JR rail office downstairs from the arrival lobby at the airport. Use these for both the train and the subways. They are super convenient and easy to re-charge. You must pay for these using yen, no credit cards accepted, so make an initial stop at the ATM. We took the Keisei Sky Access Line [1130 Yen each way] to the Oshiage subway station. This is the end of the Hanzomon subway line. Stay on this line until you reach Hanzomon station [230 yen]. There is an elevator, but it gets you out at the back of the station at the opposite end you need to be. Take EXIT #1. There are two escalators which cut down on the stairs. When you exit the station, turn right and you will be at a curb almost right away. Cross the street and immediately turn left to cross the street again. You will be at the hotel in two very short blocks.Food near the Hotel:There are two excellent bakeries very close to the hotel. If you walk back towards Hanzomon station but go one more block, you will see a Lawson’s store [like a 7-11]. When you see the Lawson’s , turn left and you are at Don Meister [open 8:00 a, to 8:00 pm]. The second bakery - a French Patisserie– get on the street that has the entrances to the subway and keep walking. You will cross a big street and pass a Thai restraint, Sawadee. Keep walking. Across the street you will pass a gas station, a little 24 hour lunch place [it was OK],and the post office [has a 24 hr ATM that accepts US cards]. I think it was also open until 8:00pm. Right next to this bakery, there was a tiny Chinese restaurant – 4 tables and a small bench. We loved the food there and ate there two times. We had sea food with noodles and vegetables for 800 Yen with a plate of 5 or 6 pot stickers for 400 Yen.

Location-wise, the hotel is convenient to two Tokyo Metropolitan subway lines (Hanzomon station on the Hanzomon line is one block away, while Kojimachi station on the Yurakucho line is about 4 blocks away). Iidabashi is a great area to explore that is easily accessible on the Yurakucho line (great restaurants, bars, shops and a Shinto shrine). Yasukuni Shrine near Kudanshita is also very near. This hotel would be a GREAT location during cherry blossom season. Immediately around the hotel, it seems to be mostly office and government buildings, with the notable exceptions of the National Theater and the Imperial Grounds (literally next door to the hotel on both accounts). There are a few restaurants that we would have tried had we not already had plans for dinner elsewhere. For us, who have been to Tokyo multiple times and live only a few hours away, this hotel was a launching point for us that is centrally located in the city (literally, I don't know if you can be in a more central location in Tokyo than here). Our biggest regret was not bringing running gear with us. From our room on the 15th floor, overlooking the Imperial Grounds, we were teased by views of dozens of runners making their way around the perimeter of the grounds along a wide, paved jogging path that appeared to have ample shade.The room was standard Japanese fare: small by American standards (but cozy for those used to Japanese business hotel accommodations), free in-room Internet access via a hard-wire hook-up only, clean and relatively quiet.

It is literally across the street from the Imperial Palace, so if you are like us, and just don’t have time to squeeze it in, you can at least see the grounds from right outside the hotel. We went in the peak of cherry blossom season, so it was lovely to be able to see cherry blossoms in full bloom right next door to our hotel at the theater. The rooms were not any smaller than anywhere else in Tokyo, and in fact feel bigger due to the huge window the bed is facing. Our room had a view of Tokyo Tower and the cute little nearby streets. The American breakfast is NOT really American as we know it… I would have preferred the Japanese one.

The room was slightly smaller than a similar hotel I stayed at whilst in Kyoto. Here the double bed is against two walls. This was not a problem for me as a single traveller but I could see that it would create some interesting manoeuvring if used as a double as one of the occupants would have to climb over the other to get out during the night (however this may well be the same in many hotels in Tokyo.) The room was exceptionally quiet and I did not hear anything from either of the neighbouring rooms. The bathroom was well appointed though the bath was not full size. Breakfast, Japanese, American or Continental, is served at a cost of circa Yen 1000 and was a pleasant start to the day. The hotel is located very conveniently to Hanzomon subway station with exit 1 of the station being a 3 minute walk from the hotel reception. The imperial palace gardens could be seen from the bedroom windows as could the Tokyo tower in the distance.My reason for giving this four rather than five stars is that the bed was a little lumpy.

And the breakfasts were tasty - we ate there three of the five mornings we were there. It is primarily a business hotel and the location reflects this. The hotel is slap bang in the middle of the business distict which meant it was quite quiet at night and during the weekends. We found this suited us but this maybe a drawback for others.

I chose this hotel as a part of my home coming trip in the latter part of March and stayed ten nights. I was curious why it is so popular and also it attracted me for its location so close to my middle school and overlooks the area my father and I have worked. Yes, the location is in an exclusive area in Tokyo, close to the brain of Japan(the National Diet Building and the surrounding government buildings), the National Theater, the Supreme Court, the British Embassey and the Imperial Palace. I was also aware that the hotel is operated by the same company as the Imperial Hotel. It is very close to the Metro Hanzomon Line (Purple line). The Exit 1 is only a couple of minutes away but since Hanzomon Line is deep we have to walk up and down two flights of stairs. Exit 4 has an elevator and it is a little farther from the hotel but it isn't actually that far. it is possible to get to many major areas in Tokyo by using transfers on the metro from this hotel. The surrounding area is all business so it is quiet. There are several convenience stores and restaurants nearby but no supermarket. There is a small supermarket a little walk away though. The Imperial moat that surrounds the garden is just across the street so it is nice to have a stroll or jog (be ware of joggers in the evening and weekends so they won't bump into you).The hotel's lobby is nice and spacius. The hotel has a large wedding hall, several reception rooms and four restaurants and they occupy the lower six floors. The breakfast is served at a cafe on the ground floor for a Western ones and at a Japanese restaurant in the basement floor for Japanese ones. I tried both and they were good. I did not try other French and Tempura restaurants but they have very good reputation. The hotel front desk staff was polite and helpful but seemed unapproachable which was rather unusual in Japan.My room was on the 12th floor. It has everything we need, a clean bed, a night shirt, a TV, tea pot with tea bags, a trouser press and a connection to PC. The bathroom is not large but efficient and clean with plenty of ammenities. The room itself is not large but not very small for Japanese standard of a ""business hotel"". By the way I think this is a higher grade business hotel. There are public computer for English and Japanese use in a small corner of the lobby.There are vending machines, a card for Pay TV vending machine and an ice machine on evert floor.The best thing about staying at this hotel is its view. It overlooks the Impereial moat to the government area and the Tokyo Tower. It is very beautiful at night although Tokyo is exercizing energy conservation and it is a little darker than I remember. The Diet Building does not light up any more. Tokyo Tower usually lights up in red and white but it lights up in different colors occasionally. It was especially nice to see the full blossomed cherry trees in the front garden of the National Theater right below my eyes.I have enjoyed the stay. The price was good for the location and the quality. To me the view itself was worth the stay.I'd like to thank all the staff for making my stay comfortable. I appreciated the room attendant lady's kindness to check if I needed extra ammenitie or tea bags on days I indicated I need no cleaning service.I have one request to the hotel. That is to consider a microwave oven on every floor. It should come in handy. I am going to stay here again next spring when I take my son and his family for a visit to Tokyo.",Albuquerque NM,"Tangarini</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albuquerque NM</strong>",51,5.0

It is a 3 minute walk to the imperial palace, so worth doing the 5.5km loop around it. Kojimachi and Hanzomon subway stations are both within easy walking distances - a previous reviewer complained about the stairs at the Hanzomon station, but if you're travelling in Tokyo, lift access is not always accessible in a lot of stations (and anyone who decides to get on a subway in Tokyo with ""a lot of luggage"", then moans about the lack of lift access, obviously doesn't plan their journey very well). Neither station is a JR line so if you're a tourist with a JR pass you'd have to pay a little more for public transport (we paid about 160 yen each time per person). There were many small restaurants around the area but nothing fantastic (we spent an hour looking for somewhere baby friendly), the closest department store was in Ginza, several stations away including a transfer. It is a business district so if you're a tourist you'd have to get on the subway for any tourist activities. The hotel itself was good - nice Japanese breakfast, a comfortably sized room, nice big bath and clean facilities. The staff spoke reasonable English for assistance with directions. No wifi in the rooms apparently - but there are coin operated (100 yen for 10 minutes) computers at the lobby. You get one 30 minute wifi access at the lobby or restaurant but it's quite slow.

We were quite disappointed with what we got in the end. Perhaps the high ratings were from the hotel's many business travellers, for whom it seems well suited. Indeed, during our 3 night stay at the Grand Arc, the bulk of the hotel's guests were businessmen.To be frank, the hotel wasn't that bad. The room was small, as is typical in Tokyo, but we've had smaller. The bathroom was well stocked up with amenities and the shower was pretty decent.The view from our 15th storey room was quite nice - partial view of the Imperial Palace and right across was a clear view of the Tokyo Tower, a pretty sight at night.Staff here spoke good English, which was a hug plus for non-Japanese speaking tourists like my wife and me.Most importantly, price was reasonable.What we didn't like:1) Although the hotel was near (less than 5 minutes' walk) from Hanzomon Station if you took Exit 1, you'd have to climb 2 flights (floors) of stairs to reach the ground level. Not a big problem if you were a business traveller or if you travel light. If you had huge and heavy luggage, you'd seriously struggle. The exit with the elevator is on the other end of the station, so you'd end up walking a good 15 minutes to the hotel from that exit. Print a good detailed map to avoid getting lost.2) Wi-fi in the hotel lobby was horrible. It was difficult to connect and when we were connected, we would get cut off every 20 seconds or so. My wife is on the iPhone 4S and I'm on the Samsung Galaxy S. 3) My wife didn't have a problem with her wired internet in the room but I did. My connection was slow and hung frequently. Perhaps it was the Windows 7/IE9 my laptop runs on... but I had no such problems at the other hotels in Tokyo.4) Again, yes, the hotel is near to the station; however Hanzomon Station is connected only to the Hanzomon line i.e. it is not a junction. To get most places such as Shinjuku or Roppongi would require at least one transfer. Not a big deal, unless you have lots of luggage with you. 5) Compared with other hotels where the staff appear eager to please and are super helpful and warm, over at the Grand Arc, staff seemed cold and aloof. When we asked for directions, two of the staff looked disinterested and we detected a hint of sarcasm and impatience in her reply. Maybe they aren't used to guests asking for directions? My wife and I were unimpressed.Overall this hotel is ok. In summary, it is probably great for business travellers.

This was also good but for a gaijin a bit difficult to manage. In addition, the Japanese style beds are laid out by the staff at 5pm and this takes up most of the floor space.

However, it was comfortable and had free broadband connection via a lead. We ate at the Patio Restaurant on the first night which had a good mix of food. The continental breakfast represented the best value at 740 yen and was very promptly delivered.The accessibilty of this hotel from Narita Airport was one of the main reasons for choosing it. Take the Keisei Sky Access train and then join the Hanzomon line to Hanzomon. Exit for Hanzomon Gate and then walk 150 metres to the hotel.

This is one of the nicest feature of this hotel. ""Hanzomon line"" has an access to major stations such as Otemachi and Shibuya. Oshiage is also a stop at the end, where a new landmark of Tokyo, ""Tokyo Sky Tree"", is there. Even if you are not very familiar to using Metro, having a cab is also an option and is likely to be affordable, as it costs no more than or around 1000JPY for Tokyo station, Akasaka, and Ginza.I paid 10500JPY for a single room for one night, through a well-known hotel reservation website. It turned out to be more expensive than reserving a room directly through the hotel website. Worth trying. At first I didn't expect much for my room considering the price, but soon I recognised that the view from the window was much much more than expected. You could see the Diet, the Supreme Court, the National Theatre, the Daiichi Seimei Building (used to be a General Head Quarter of US), and the Imperial Palace. Indeed, a top-down view of the Imperial Palace may not be easily expected in Tokyo expect for suite rooms up in the upper-end hotels. If you are interested in ensuring such a view, I do recommend what can be seen from the room you will reserve, since the building is round-shaped and what you can see varies. The hotel is situated neighbouring to two monumental sites; the Supreme court and the National Theatre. The former was selected as one of ""50 heritages of monumental architecture in Tokyo"". I recommend this hotel especially to tourists relatively new to Tokyo, who may have had a nightmare of being charged of exorbitant price at any hotel in Tokyo, who may be unfamiliar to using Metro, or who has never been in the Imperial Palace or been to see the Diet etc.","Hamamatsu, Japan","kjt08</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamamatsu, Japan</strong>",29,5.0

Take exit 1 or 2, cross the street and the hotel is just on the next block. There are a lot of stairs and it was a bit hard dealing with luggage, but worth the savings on a cab.Buy a Suica or Passmo pass for the subway as soon as you get there and then reload as you go! The Hanzomon line connects with many other lines in the city and takes you right to busy Shibuya - just five stops away.I didn't find many restaurants near the hotel and didn't try the restaurants at the hotel, but there are two little quick markets that will do in a pinch.",San Diego,"xsb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",12,5.0

We were extremely pleased in all regards.First Impressions: Extremely clean, not-quite-luxury but close lobby and finishes, quick check-in (did not experience any communication issues though the helpful staff do not know much English beyond what is required for checking in and out)The Room: We stayed on the 10th floor in room 1009. We loved our room and had a great view of the Imperial Palace and could see Tokyo Tower! Again, the room was spotless. The bathroom was fully stocked with toiletries (razor, toothbrush, shampoo, soap, etc.) and the toilet was of the fancy sort. Our room was made up each day and we had no issues. The bed (we did the room with the bed slightly larger than a twin/slightly smaller than a full American size) and slept comfortably. The bed was a little firm, but the space was not an issue (I am 5'8"" and my husband has very broad shoulders and is 6'2""). There is a TV (virtually no English channels except for a watered-down BBC World News, but this was not a concern of ours) and a mini-fridge you can actually use to store your own food and drinks. It was a lovely home away from home!The Location: We were so very pleased with the Hanzomon neighborhood. It was very high-end (not sure I have seen so many $100,000 cars in so few days in my life) and felt very clean and safe, though I would compare it to the Wall Street area of NYC: it pretty much empties out after work hours. I would also liken it to staying on Pennsylvania Ave. in DC, being just down the street from the National Diet Building. We were a 5 minute walk from the Hanzomon station, and 1-15 minute walk from a second station (forgetting the name). We had easy access to almost everywhere we wanted to go from those two lines. The Food Situation: We had one of the continental breakfast options one morning and it was very good and was served on what seemed to be china (possibly a porcelain). We each had an English muffin with ham, a small fruit salad, a glass of fruit juice, a tea or coffee, and toasted raisin bread. It seemed small but filled us until lunch. It was a little pricey (I believe about $20) and so for the remaining three mornings we ventured a few blocks away to a Don Meister (I think that is right?) bakery and enjoyed delightful pastries for half the money. There was plenty of selection for us in the neighborhood, though everything was a 5-10 minute walk. Our favorite was a little place called Lush Kitchen, and is located on the same block and street as Don Meister (running perpendicular to the street the drive-in entrance to the hotel lobby). You can't go wrong here--the menu features pictures of pork potstickers and fried chicken. These were delicious, but everything coming out of the kitchen looked delicious. We also ate off the lunch menu, which was noodle bowls and was also quite good. It was also very affordable.The Bottom Line: We are thrilled to have found such a quality hotel (I would say it is a very good business travel hotel, not quite luxury but close) at an exceptionally great price in a very nice neighborhood; we paid about $120 a night. I would not hesitate to stay here again or recommend it to virtually anyone.","Houston, Texas","anothermrs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",111,5.0

Free tours of the Palace and Gardens are available by pre-registering with the Palace and start a short distance from the hotel. Also in walking distance are the Modern Art Museum, the Arts and Craft Museum and Science and Technology Museum. There are several restaurants in the hotel and we enjoyed the food and service we received. Our room was very quiet and clean and had tea and coffee facilities with a small hot plate to heat the water. This was a little slower than a kettle but fine. The bed was against a wall which was a little inconvenient but it was one of the smallest and cheapest rooms. There was a fridge. Free internet access was wired and free enabling an excellent Skype connection. There was an excellent range of toiletries provided in the bathroom which had a power shower and bottom washing toilet. The staff were very helpful and even sent a book back to us which we had left in the room. We travelled from the airport on the Airport Limosine (coach) but the nearest drop off was at the Hotel Excelsior which is about 1 km away. We could have got a taxi but mistakenly attempted the metro assuming that, like London there would be escalators. As there were not this was a struggle with our cases.

It is a classy establishment right in the middle of Tokyo that served our needs exceedingly well.Our room was clean and well-appointed and while no one would describe it as roomy, there was certainly enough space to move around and to store our belongings. The views of the Imperial Palace were beautiful and quite memorable. Beds are comfortable and the fridge was a welcome touch. A flat screen TV in the room offered several local channels as well as CNN. Air conditioning works well and kept the room livable even on the hottest, most humid days.The hotel itself is quite elegant and has a remarkably beautiful lobby atrium. Service was always warm and helpful. The hotel restaurant offers a very good breakfast special with western selections (including coffee). Considering that other hotels during our trip were charging twice the price for similar meals, I'd say the Grand Arc is an excellent deal.The location of the hotel is both good and bad. It is very central meaning that other parts of Tokyo are very easy to access (the purple line is a less than 5 minute walk away). The Imperial Palace grounds are across the street. However, there is very little in the immediate vicinity of the hotel in terms of shopping, entertainment and restaurants that would be of interest to visitors.

In the Chiyoda business district, the area is quiet after-hours and isn't the best way to experience Tokyo as a tourist. However, the quality and value of the hotel, and the ability to hop on a train after a short walk are beneficial. Because the area is a business district, there aren't many bars and restaurants locally. For food, I would recommend Vege-Table, which is just around the corner. The restaurant, which I visited twice, had very friendly, english-speaking staff (with english menu), and focussed their menu around vegetables (not vegetarian, although there were options), which made for a nice healthy meal amongst the many unhealthy restaurants. It was also well-priced. The hotel room was excellent - large windows letting in lots of light and providing a great view of the Imperial Palace grounds and city skyline. Our twin room had two semi-double beds, and a spacious bathroom with a basin and mirror external to the bathroom. Free internet was provided through a wired connection. The beds were comfortable (well, by Japanese standards) and the room was quiet. There are three restaurants, but we deemed them too pricey, so found others locally or elsewhere.

Was very surprised that grand arc turns out to be such a classy hotel. Of course, it's no mandarin oriental, but if you are able to book the discount rate, this is definitely the best value for money. Pros:1. 4 star - grand arc is just totally in a different league from other budget chains like toyoko inn and villa fontaine. If toyoko inn is 1 star, villa fontaine 2-3 star, grand arc would be at least 4 star. BUT the price for grand arc is actually cheaper!!!!! When I stayed there, some very important person (politician possibly?) must have stayed or dined at the hotel. There were like 30 bodyguards on the streets and at the lobby to escort him. imagine the chances of that happening at toyoko inn ;-)2. Room size - the semi double room is 18m2+ in grand arc vs toyoko inn12-3m2 and villa fontaine's 14-16m2. Room is small for 2 people but very sufficient for single. One thing to remember is that a ""semi double"" room means that you are renting a single room for double use legitimately. So, it's unreasonable to compare the semi double room size to the normal double rooms by american standards. Years ago when hotels in japan were much more expensive than everywhere else, the semi double rooms became a good alternative for travellers who wanted to save money. Now that the hotel prices for every other countries have been increasing yearly, prices are quite comparable for normal twin/double rooms in japan and other countries. You can get a double room 33-40m2 in tokyo for usd 150-200, about the same as in bangkok. So if a couple decides to stay in a semi double room, they should realize that they are offered an alternative unique in japan so that they can pay a lower price for a smaller room.3. View from room - rarely in tokyo, especially budget hotels, does the room have such an open view. The hotel is located next to the imperial garden, so there is no building blocking the view at all. To the right side of the window, i could even see the tokyo tower light up every night. One more good thing about the open view is that it makes the room feels bigger.4. location is a plus and a minus. first there were some misunderstanding from previous reviewers that needed to be clarified. There IS an elevator to the ground at hanzomon station, just not at the closest exit to the hotel. For anyone who plans to stay there, there is elevator from platform to the gate and then another elevator at exit 5 to the ground level. The only problem is that exit 5 is at the other end of the station and hanzomon is a pretty long station, so it's quite a few blocks further from the hotel and there is a little upward slope outside of exit 5. But it's still better than haulting heavy luggage up flights of stairs.hanzomon line is actually much more convenient than i previous thought. can get to most anywhere in tokyo with max 1 transfer. for example,narita airport - 1 easy transfer at oshiage station (w/ escalators and a short walk). don't really need to pay higher nex fare to get to tokyo station and then get a taxi. dragging luggage around tokyo station to get to the taxi stand would probably be a longer walk than the transfer at oshiage station. if worst comes to worst, can always get a taxi from exit 5 hanzomon to hotel (about 8min walk to hotel with luggage)shibuya - direct trainomotesando - direct train mitsukoshimae - direct train (huge mitsukoshi department store)kinshicho - direct train (1 of the biggest 100yen store in tokyo and a famous yakitori restaurant)tsukiji market - 1 easy transfer at kiyosumishirakawaikebukuro - 1 transfer ginza - 1 transfer with a long walk or there is a bus next to the hotel which runs twice every hour. takes 20minshinjuku - 1 easy transfer at aoyamaicchomeshinbashi - 1 transfer with a long walkasakusa - 1 transfer at oshiageebisu - 1 transfernihonbashi - 1 transferakasaka - 1 easy transferryokoku - 1 easy transfer akihabara - 1 transfer at kinshichoas hanzomon is pretty at the center of tokyo, it's actually closer to travel to the rest of the city than shinjuku and shibuya. 5. service - pretty much impeccable as most other hotels in japan. service standards were 5 star. e.g. i bought some fruit and asked for a knife to peel them. within min, they sent the full set of knife, fork, plate, wet naps, and paper napkin so thick that it can pass for real napkin.6. accessories - full set of accessories including toner, lotion, after shave etc. normal for standard hotels but rare for hotels at the budget range. even the slippers were not the paper type that are used in all budget hotels.7. free internet in room. notebook available for rent for 1000yen per night.8. not the normal yukata provided. It's a button bathrobe which is great coz with normal yukata, the belt is always in the way when sleeping. but then it's not too sexy looking...cons:1. neighborhood is commercial and there are not a lot of restaurants or supermarket around. but there is 1 convenient store 1 min from hotel, 1 small supermarket 5 min away. Many of the famous restaurants in the city is just a short train ride away though.2. service was great but it was a bit strange that they were not too familiar with sending luggage to narita... don't know if it's coz mostly japanese businessmen stay there and there is no need for sending luggage to narita...? the girl needed to look up the procedure but they had it done though.3. there was no voicemail. needed to leave message with the staff.all in all very very satisfied with grand arc and would recommend to anyone who gets a good deal.",hong kong,"yammi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>hong kong</strong>",63,5.0

Were it not for the small Tokyo-sized room I would say it actually deserves a 4-star rating. As it was, the room size was still much larger than all the other hotels I looked at in the same price range; it was perfectly roomy for one person. My room was billed as 'semi-double', whatever that is, fine for one person but would be bit of a squeeze for two. You can see for yourself if you go the hotel homepage - the room looks exactly like it does in the photo. Bathroom was fine, very clean, water was hot and shower was high pressure. Provided big bottles of shampoo/conditioner/shower gel. I rate hotels by their bathrooms and on the basis of this one, it's a big thumbs up. The hotel itself, though not a luxury hotel, was obviously a class establishment. A fairly busy venue for functions and weddings; many smartly dressed Japanese milling about the lobby/elevators. The function rooms are all on the lower floors though so my room was very quiet. Didn't have much occasion to speak to hotel staff but they were perfectly helpful when I did; provided a helpful little map of the local area with restaurants and convenience stores marked out. And that's actually all there is in the vicinity: small restaurants and convenience stores. Definitely not the hotel for people who want to be in the thick of it all. I think the area was more of a business/commercial district. The metro station is a minute walk away though so it's fine if you plan to travel daily anyway. The nearest metro is Hanzomon station on the Hanzomon line. I found I changed lines daily at the next station along, Nagatacho (also connected to Akasaka-mitsuke), so it would have been perfect if the hotel had been nearer that station but the Tokyo metro system is very convenient so it wasn't really a problem. (Tip: Tokyo stations are big so get the right exit!) So the location is probably the thing I liked least as it wasn't very interesting but in return you get a quiet and very safe neighbourhood right in the middle of the city next to the Imperial Palace. Best thing about my room was the glorious view. The hotel rooms have huge picture windows and the view is great day and night with Tokyo Tower twinkling in the distance. One suggestion mentioned in other reviews that I'll repeat is to get a taxi to the hotel instead of braving the metro - like I said before, Tokyo stations are big with many flights of stairs and long passageways; if you don't like lugging luggage around I wouldn't recommend it. I came from Haneda and got the airport bus (900 Yen) to Tokyo station, then a taxi from there (around 1500 yen). Tokyo taxis are expensive so this was the only time I took them. Airport bus drops off and leaves from the Yaesu exit side of Tokyo station (Tokyo station is huge and has 2 main exits).","London, United Kingdom","kireipan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0
