It was my first time in NY and we were there to celebrate my birthday. My partner made a note about it being my birthday when booking and when we arrived they upgraded us to the most amazing room with incredible views of the Empire State Building. The whole stay was perfect and we loved the rooftop bar and the little bodega down by the front desk. Staff were all super lovely and couldn’t have been more helpful! The only thing that would have made it even better would be to have some tea / coffee facilities in the room, but not a big deal. Since our visit, my partner and I have been desperately trying to find out what the scent of the hotel is - it smells amazing! If you could tell us please do!

When booking a King Bed City I asked if it was possible to have the highest room they could offer. We were greeted with incredibly attentive staff, they had taken note of our request, we very much appreciated this. As we had booked through Ebookers I had a bonus to use which upgraded our room (if there was one available) I mentioned to a staff member and they were able to offer our last night in a King Sky. We were delighted that they were even able to arrange this! During our stay at Arlo Nomad we were met with absolutely NO disappointments at all. On our first night we wanted to check out the rooftop, we were completely blown away by the view, we were lucky enough to be up there by ourselves and it was just a moment that we will never forget. The hotel also had its own smell, I made the terrible mistake of not buying the room spray (no joke when I say I’m still regretting not buying it now as I can’t get it delivered to the U.K.) honestly the best smell ever; including the amenities they leave in the bathroom to use. I have never felt so strongly about recommending a hotel more. I have told every friend and family member that it is an absolute must to stay here when visiting NY. Hoping that next time we visit we will try the SoHo location as the balconies look wonderful. I can’t imagine I will ever find a hotel that gives a better NY experience than Arlo Nomad - falling asleep/waking up to those views is something you will not forget. Thank you Arlo Nomad, sincerely you’re biggest fan :) ",,luciepitman,0,5.0

It is very centrally located. We wanted to go as far south as Battery Park and north as Central Park and this hotel was really a great location for us. Walking distance to Bryant Park. It was super cute and hip. It had a very fun and energetic air. The ambiance was on point. Loved the bar, the yoga classes. Everyone was so friendly!! We arrived to the hotel at 9:30 am. The hotel happily accepted our luggage. To my surprise, they called me by 11am to let me know my room was ready. Who does that? Nobody lets you into a room by 11am!!!! We didn't go back to the room, however having flown the red eye, it was so comforting to know that I had the option to go back since I had only slept 2 hours on the plane. The room was typical small NY size, but it was really modern and minimalist. I loved it. It had a clean look to it, yet homey. There is a small little snack/coffee shop in the lobby. It was so cute and so perfect for any small needs. Loved the character of the hand written notes by the elevator. Would highly recommend this hotel.

They made sure a room was ready for our early morning arrival, but they were also concerned that we wouldn’t like our view. They allowed us to drop our bags off in the first room, to rest if we needed after our red eye flight, and then, when my wife and I went to grab a bite of lunch, they moved our luggage to a new room on the 27th floor that had a view of the East River and the early morning sunrise.

(Every Tuesday they have $1 wigs that are absolutely out of this world, and you have to wash it down with an Oi Rita) it's about 5 minutes from the hotel, Ask the front desk for details as I don't remember where it was located The room was incredible, very spacious and has an amazing view. My friend and I were upgraded after a little issue we had making our way to the hotel from the airport. Even-though it was not there problem to resolve, they went above and beyond to accommodate us considering arlo nomad was not our first choice I was surprised at how welcoming and kind they all were. Jennell, Myakal, Anderson and other staff where all very kind and helpful. Answered questions and concerns I had. They Couldn't off been any more professional.By the end of my birthday trip I was getting ready to check out and there was a little misunderstanding with the (unban fee) this is a fee of $35 everyday till you check out of the hotel. From my understanding the fee covers drinks at the bar from 4pm till 7pm and the water that is in the room etc..... As I was unhappy to say the least, I had a convocation with Cordell Nelson the director of operation he explained the fees to me, as I started to understand I also started to claimed down.Cordell was very sweet and understanding of our situation and with the miscommunication that had taken place at check in, however as he could hear from my voice I was in shock that this wasn't something that was overly specified from the beginning, he was able to take off the fees as a one of and I was very appreciative of that.I will definitely be going back to Arlo NoMad and recommend you spend you break with them, a little home away from home ","London, United Kingdom","JetAlexandra</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

Clean, modern and quaint hotel. Stayed in a city view room with a queen bed. View was good, but not amazing. You could see the empire state building, but only if you went right up to the glass and looked over. Otherwise the view from the bed was just okay considering you are paying extra for it. Definitely tight quarters, but we knew that we booked, so that was as expected. Overall a cute hotel that I would likely stay at again. My only minor complaint was the elevator system. It felt like it always took longer than it should to get up and down and the elevator often had floors selected that nobody in the elevator was going to causing unnecessary extra time in the trip.","Dedham, Massachusetts","mpkreitzman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dedham, Massachusetts</strong>",1,4.0

Didn’t know much about the hotel until I booked it and since it’s a half business trip for me, I didn’t mean to pick a super fancy hotel. All I want is a honey, clean place to rest and close to my friend that I wanted to visit. However! This hotel surprised me and I will rate this hotel the best hotels among all the places I stayed in the USA. Of course, I didn’t stay in a lot hotels, but I personally love Arlo. Internal decorations, furniture set ups, different details, the lighting, the temperature, the service, the location. Everything is just so perfect to my standards. For the room that I stayed, is a urban view, which is located at eighth floor. Not the perfect room for viewing because I arrived super late due to the delay of the flight. But the front desk told me I can ask for upgrades! I did not upgrade my room even I really want due to my personal schedule. I will definitely go back for a better view! But if you book online and pick a city view, ask for a higher level, the view will be amazing! A lot of guests mentioned that the size of the room is pretty small. For me, I am alone plus I am Asian, I Akins of perfect the small cozy room size. It’s all personal preferences! To me, if you are traveling, it’s better to walk outside than staying at the hotel room right? The hotel room is not really necessary to be huge so you can run around, it’s more like a place to offer you a great sleep! Anyway, as I said, personal preferences, I love the size and I won’t love it more if it’s bigger size. All the products they use are available at the front desk for you to purchase. They are one of my favorite brand and the amount they provided is much more than other places who gives you a tiny bottle. I like how they have multiple functions in tv. You can watch online tv, purchase movies and even connect to your phone and chromecadt! I think everything is amazing there. I didn’t check out the gym and restaurant part so I could not leave a comment, but I do see amazing activities posted that guest can join in! Lastly, I want to mention the location again. It’s located in Korean town, and convenient to either directions. If you like night activities and want some food very late, it’s the great choice case there is a 24/7 market 2 mins walk away; a Korean restaurant right beside the hotel, a whole street of Korean food street away.

Angie - if you read this you made my day/night!I ran up to my room which was a street view king size room and settled in. The rooms are a bit on the smaller size (NY - it is expected) but super cozy and well designed for NY. The room was double glass windows with sheer gauze curtains, but black out shades you can drop for privacy and lighting. The bed takes up most of the room, but there was a large tv artfully right outside the bathroom, a narrow closet, and clever cabinets above the closet. The bed also had slide out side panels for side tables. As I mentioned - great design!The doors are a little thin so you can hear a lot of noise from the hallway and elevators, but it didn't seem like an overwhelmingly noisy hotel so I didn't have many issues. The hotel room also had a few free snacks in it (how kind) and has free drinks on the second floor lounge from 5:30pm-7pm.

If the good vibes aren’t right, I don’t want it! Fortunately with Arlo, the vibes are more than right! So When I visit from California there wasn't any other place I wanted to rest my head, my heels and my cocktail. Most recently I celebrated my birthday in NY and had a room block for my vibe tribe for a few days. From start to finish, I had no complaints with how each representative treated me. One rep in particular stands out the most, GiGi. When I came in late from partying, and plopped down on the lobby couch to take my shoes off from my a swollen feet kinda wild night...I didn’t even have to ask she just handed me a water and some slippers. She also went upstairs like the angel she is and came down with slippers and bathrobes for all the rest of my crew! I mean, what?! Winning! I could have died and went to Heaven right there. That’s the kind of service you’re going to get! Im still not done, there’s more kudos. When I woke up in the morning and needed coffee to come back to life, I hit the hotel bodega and simply requested a little something warm, with some flavor and life and the female barista badass whipped me up a coffee so smooth and tasty without me even having to specifically explain what might do the trick...she was already on it! Also, I appreciated Ben and Carlos and even Karly at the front desk (managers and directors) who were so helpful and accommodating from explaining invoices, suggesting good foodie spots to giving me some complimentary cards for cocktails at their bar to help me celebrate accordingly. In a nutshell, there’s no I in team so cheers to this hotel and it’s amazing team of people who helped make my birthday stay a success. I’m truly grateful for your services.

I also loved the fact that the stocked water in the room was “Just Water”, which if you do your research, is a spring water with natural minerals and ph content in a plant derived carton. I haven’t seen them at too many hotels so that’s definitely a plus! Sometimes it the little things that count I also cannot forget to mention the hotel staff.

Let’s talk location first. It’s situated smack in the middle of midtown hence it’s extremely convenient to anything and anywhere. Lots of KBBQ around considering too. It’s also walking distance to Herald Square which isn’t far from Times Square and Bryant Park. Not forgetting Arlo is along 5th Ave. The staff were amazing. Extremely friendly and helpful. Two incidents particularly stood out for me. The first was when I decided not to get my room made for almost two days and had the DND sign on. The front desk emailed me to check up on me which I feel was a really nice touch and a show of concern from them. The other incident was when I came down with fever and had asked the front desk if they could help contact and see if I can get my Broadway tickets rescheduled. Though it was unsuccessful, I really appreciated the help from front desk. As I was travelling alone, the Queen Urban room was perfect for me. It didn’t feel cramped at all, instead it was cosy. Everything was great though sometimes the heater can get a little noisy. I was situated at level 5 so I didn’t have any issue with the lifts like other reviewers did. This is due to me using the 1st lift that only served up to level 8. I didn’t really used the facilities there though I briefly checked out the rooftop bar during Xmas. Beautiful sunset to take in with a view of the Empire State Building. I feel the price is on the steep side but having scouted around for hotels in NYC, I would say the rates are identical around and Arlo looked the best.

He took us to the rooftop, so my parents could check out the mind blowing view of Empire State Building and experience the glass floor (wow)! He also treated us complementary drinks at the bar later. This is the perfect example of hospitality! We left feeling very happy! I’m coming back to get some more dining experience there.

She was very polite and professional and the next day offered me another room that was more suitable to what I was used to.

I emailed a manger beforehand to ask if I could be placed in a room at the highest floor possible. When I checked in, they said they allocated me a room on the 29th floor (last floor with bedrooms). I was so pleased as I faced the Empire. It was a truly spectacular view. Thank you Maggie! I will list the pros and cons:Pros-Absolutely breathtaking view from my room.-Fabulous location - Penn Station is walking distance to get train to EWR (super easy and much cheaper than cab if you don’t have a lot of luggage).-The room was beautifully and very cleverly designed. There was plenty of storage and I loved the in-built hooks for my pajamas.- Cosy bed with crisp linen. I had the best sleep every night.- Citibike cycle passes - included in Urban Fee and saved me from using the subway. I highly recommend downloading the Citibike app and and explore NYC on bike. It’s safe and so much fun! - Housekeeping staff - always so friendly and polite whenever I saw them. Special shout out to Meryem. My room was immaculately clean daily. - The lounges on the 2nd floor were so relaxing. - Great water pressure despite being on the 29th floor. - There were some lovely snack samples in the room. I really enjoyed these. -lovely toiletries and the steamer and hairdryer were very useful.- If you are used to room service, this isn’t the place for you. It’s a lovely but functional hotel. - Althought the roof lounge is not open, do go up there to experience the view and the glass platform. I can’t imagine a better Empire SB view. Go there in the morning and night. - if you get lost, just look for the Empire and head in that direction. - would definitely return as a solo traveller.- really enjoyed reading the memory board outside the lift. Haven’t seen this in any other hotel. Reading all the happy sentiments reinforced what an amazing city NYC is.Cons- The rooms are cleverly designed but I’m not sure there would be enough space for large suitcases. It was fine for my small trolley bag. However, Arlo are very honest about the room size. - I told Reception staff I didn’t drink alcohol and they said non-alcoholic beverages would be available during happy hour (included in Urban Fee). The bar man made me a lovely mocktail, however, wasn’t pleased about it. I think you need to make non-alcoholic options available as there are teetotalers or those who drink out of choice. It seems unfair to exclude these people given they pay the same urban fee as those who can have endless wine.-All Urban Fee benefits are not widely publicized. I read what this included before I arrived and had to ask for gym and bike passes. These should be listed as a matter of course. I saw the list in the lift but it wasn’t a full list.- The water bottles were really lovely and I used my bottles daily. As someone who consumes copious amounts of mineral water, it saved me a lot of money and waste. However, I think more should be made available throughout the stay and not just on the day of arrival. - The Urban Fee didn’t represent good value. I paid $210 for 6 days. - More steps could be taken to be more sustainable. For example, individual fruit at the Bodega doesn’t need to be wrapped in plastic.",,Sadia_Majid,1,5.0

Booking late I was already paying top dollar for the room - over $400 for a teeny tiny room so the additional $35 seemed to be adding insult to injury.However over the course of my stay my mood thawed. Firstly the Wi-Fi included in the urban fee is properly fast - almost 100mbs download speed. Second, although the room was tiny, the bed was comfy and the shower pressure good.Most of all though the staff were all lovely. Nothing was too much trouble. I even managed to borrow one of their bikes for a couple of hours.Generally I dislike resort fees as they are a tax on the single traveller.

That said, as a paying guest, this hotel still missed the mark for me for the reasons below.1) The rooms are incredibly small. I appreciate they advertise as a micro hotel but the size of our bunk-bed room was laughable with little storage or floor space. It also felt dated and dark compared to images we had seen on the website.2) I found a number of the staff at reception hostile and unfriendly, even when first arriving. It gives a sense that the hotel has an arrogance about it.3) I raised a serious feather/down allergy on booking 9-months prior to my arrival, asking the hotel to ensure that the bedding did not contain it. On arriving, I reiterated the point and was assured that the note would have been dealt with - this was not the case. 3 trips back down to reception (and sneezing all the way!) before the bedding was changed because reception kept reinforcing the point that “they don’t use down in this hotel”, despite the label on my pillow which said “contains 100% feather”....4) The lifts are incredibly slow - you can end up waiting 5-10 minutes for one at reception to take you up to your room.The rooftop was by far the greatest draw to the hotel for me however, it is open for public use and therefore doesn’t warrant paying to be a guest. Having looked on the site, I know the hotel does have some great rooms with spectacular views, however on the whole, I believe you could find far better value hotels in the city that exceed the standard of the Arlo.

The hotel lobby is very modern and had a bodega with barista and fridge or snacks available. The staff was extremely nice and accommodating. I had called to request a Empire State Building view (like many trip advisor posters recommended) and when we got there we unfortunately did not get that view. We called down to the front desk and they remediated the problem promptly by having a switch the next day. They even took our belongings from our room and placed them in the new room while were were out. The room is TINY, but you have to expect that when you're in New York and not at a brand name luxury hotel. But while tiny, it was very tasteful -- modern and efficient use of space! The shower had great water pressure, which is always a win and the tv's had google chrome cast so we were able to screen mirror our favorite show when we turned in for the night. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars ( I would give 4.5 if I could!) was because the bed was a bit disappointing. For the niceness of the hotel we expected the mattress, pillows, and linens to be on par in quality. They seemed to be the standard items you would find at a Holiday Inn or Embassy Suites. While not terrible and we slept just fine, we just expected better. I think if they at least switched out the linens and pillows to higher quality, it would take the experience to the next level.

Yes, sometimes closed at random times but you can still go up there for the view. Having a little coffee bar in the lobby was clutch. We chose the room with floor to ceiling windows (anniversary trip, why not) and the view. Is. Spectacular. The rooms are on the smaller side but this is New York City not Houston so don’t knock them for it. The bathrooms have a frosted glass door that have a small opening up top, so not necessarily the most romantic when you’re actually using it, but you should just get comfortable doing that around your partner because that’s life and if not, that’s what headphones are for.

My room had a queen size bed as requested. The room was extremely small (think cruise ship), but seemingly intentionally designed to be that way, as it seems guests at the hotel like to spend much of their time in the common areas when not out in the city. The room was extremely clean. Room design was carefully thought of, making very efficient use of all spaces: shower area, bathroom counter, small desk space, a little corner seat, bed, and storage for luggage. The lighting options were nice and the feel of the room was cozy in the evening. The common areas where people seem to spend time are on the 2nd floor and are really nice. They include a quiet study-type/lounge room with sofas, chairs, and long tables where guests are generally working with their laptops; the bar area; and a third back room area. All these spaces seem to serve as shared worspace and socializing areas. The lobby has a great coffee shop that also serves croissants and similar items. Most of the crowd in the hotel seemed to be young professionals in their 20s and 30s. The hotel is centrally located in midtown which makes it accessible to all parts of town. All the staff - coffee shop, lobby, bar, etc. were friendly and helpful with inquiries. I would stay at this hotel again any time. Since my room was small, and perhaps others are too by design, I probably would not recommend it if you travel with too many bags or really like spending time in the room.

I was shocked, to be honest. As an influencer, I have never treated that way. I guess I should thank you. Also, prior arriving, I had requested a room with the better view.

I know that september is the high season, and that prices in the city are high during this time. We used booking.com, which went smooth and gave us the lowest price available. We booked a queen city room and requested a corner room.There was some facilities that I feel that a hotel in the city should have, in this price range. There was no room service, and absolutely no information prepared for us at the hotel room (you usually get some information about foods, what to do, etc.).The rooms are cute and tiny, as expected in NY. The room offers what you need, but nothing else. The aircondition is extremly loud, and you need to have it on the whole time to be able to breathe. If you decide to book this hotel, make sure to get a corner room. It’s not possible to book this directly, but make sure you contact the hotel and request it. This is the only way you are going to get the «perfect» holiday pictures from your visit. Yes, it’s materialistic, but let’s be honest - that’s why you’re even considering this hotel.At last but not least: then, there is the popular elevator issue.. There are 2 elevators that can take you to your room, they are really slow and you will wait in a crowded line for a good amount of your time in the city.

I paid extra for a city view and was given something east facing, which is not anything to pay extra for (the cool city buildings are to the north and and south). There was also a strange odor in my room that no one could get to the bottom of. It disturbed me a bit since it smelled like gas.

I've never been billed for this type of thing before at Manhattan hotel. I felt ripped off.

When I got to the front desk, I shared what had happened with the concierge (Andy or Anderson?) and he was incredibly empathetic and just pretty funny about the whole thing. Since I'd had such a bad experience and it was very late at night, he found a way to upgrade me to an even nicer room free of charge and it just blew me away. When I walked into the room, I cried. I was so relieved! It was such a juxtaposition between a bad room, bad experience, and bad staff at the Freehand and the incredible room, staff and experience at the Arlo. I ate a salad and watched soccer and stared out my window which had a beautiful view of uptown and the Empire State Bldg and was so content.

The room itself was very clean and comfortable, although the mattress was not as comfortable as I had hoped. The views were wonderful. The elevators became a bit annoying throughout our stay. At certain times, especially in the evenings, it was difficult to get an elevator to and from the room due to the popularity of the rooftop bar. We enjoyed grabbing breakfast (from outside the hotel) and taking in the view on the rooftop patio every morning. The website describes that there is a ""bodega"" in the lobby, but it was really more of a pop-up cafe. The lattes they made were delicious! We had a few snags in our trip, none caused by the Arlo, and I felt that the staff went above and beyond for us time and time again. We arrived a day late due to several cancelled flights, and the person at the front desk offered to reimburse our night without us even asking.

I’ll start off saying all the staff were extremely friendly, however upon check in I was not given any information about the hotel and there is no information in the rooms. No neighborhood guides, information about the property - nothing. I ended up speaking with Gigi who works overnights and was excellent to get information on my way out the morning after check in. The rooms are small, very small, but it’s NY so sometimes that’s par for the course. I received a complimentary upgrade which was great however my room was on the same floor as the housekeeping station so I heard it all night. Additionally, there is no service elevator and there is a rooftop (which is nice) so the elevators can be quite backed up. When you check in you receive two small boxed waters which are not refilled. There is no mini bar and there is no room service. When I called the FD around 10:30pm asking for them to send up a water they told me they don’t send up water and that I could come down to buy one in the cafe. This whole situation was so small but so big. A hotel that refuses to send up water to a guest even if it’s at a cost? I’ve never heard of that in my life. I’ve worked at hotels and stayed at many around the world and can’t fathom this not being available.

Also, no coffee In room and coffee bar in lobby doesn’t open until 7 am on weekends, which is fairly normal for NYC, but not without some alternative. I suggest they provide free serve yourself coffee from 6 am to 7 am for people like me who have early appointments, flights or want a cup of java before a run. As others have noted, elevators are overworked and the wait can be long. Consider staying on a lower floor where you have access to a separate elevator. I would consider returning if traveling by myself and if the price is low.","Miami, Florida","Kathy D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",11,4.0

Every staff member that I encountered was kind, polite and helpful. My room (Queen city view, 19th floor) was very clean. The rooms are small, definitely for 1 or 2 people but well organized. There was small fridge in the room, in which I was able to store my own drinks and snacks. The shower had really good water pressure. My room was quiet during the night. One thing to note is that the blinds are not room darkening so if you are not a morning person, maybe take a sleep mask with you. I booked a fantastic rate from Travelzoo which included breakfast. The breakfast was quite good-eggs, oatmeal, cereal, fruit, greens, a variety of pastries and bread, orange juice, coffee and tea were all available-something for everyone. Finally, my plane was cancelled on the last night of my vacation and with the help of Carly at the front desk, I was able to stay another night at another great rate. Thank you Carly!

The hotel is in a great location in NY and you can travel anywhere from nearby subway stations. We went to the empire state building first thing in the morning and the hotel being round the corner meant we could relax and take out time about it. I would happily return to the hotel on my next visit. The only things I could suggest to improve on would be drawers for storage and the possibility of gaining access to the rooftop for sunset - as I was wide awake at 5am on the first morning and would have loved to have seen the sunrise over the city. Possibly adding beer to the list of free wine and prosecco - only because my wife and I don't drink either.

I spent a lot of time waiting for the lift as my room was on 20th floor. This was further frustrated when one of the lifts that served all floors was out of action for a day.The pricing system was off, I had emailed the hotel a couple of times before my arrival as I noticed the price had gone down since my initial booking. They always lowered the new lower price. Upon arrival I was then charged even less - I spoke to management about it who couldn’t advise why. Don’t get me wrong I’m not complaining about getting the room cheaper but it defo felt like they try and charge as much as they can to get you there.The bar on the roof top is nice but over priced. Also it felt like anyone can could just use it and was over crowed at lots of points. I feel like hotel guests should be given priority. Also no smoking on the rooftop - I wasn’t aware of this this maybe it’s general for New York.The room was fine albeit small but toilet/bathroom is separated by a glass sliding door and offers very little privacy if you are sharing with a friend. If you are okay with someone hearing your bathroom habits then no problem but for me this was off putting.

The lobby was well designed and featured a modern sitting area and suspended staircase, as well as a small cafe where you can buy coffee or other bottled drinks. Our room included breakfast which we did not try. One of the best amenities is everyday from 5:30-7pm on the second floor is FREE happy hour (all you’d like to drink wine/bubbly/beer). There is also a nice/but somewhat pricey rooftop bar for good views after happy hour, access from second floor.ROOMOur room was quaint and efficient, as you’d expect an NYC hotel to be. Our bed was only accessible from one side, as it had windows/a wall on 3 sides- this was not a problem for us as we are in our 30’s, but I can imagine this being a problem for elderly or people that wake up often to pee at night. The bed was very comfortable (however the pillows offered very minimal support). They have roll down blinds that do a poor job of blocking out the light between window panes (our room was incredibly bright at sunrise every morning, so we did not sleep long sadly). The shower had a waterfall rain shower with excellent water pressure. There is a steamer and hair dryer in the room. There is not a luggage rack, iron or magnifying mirror in the room. The air conditioning worked very well too!LOCATIONThe North Madison location is very close to the yellow line 28th/Broadway station. It was a $40-$50 uber ride to LGA (about 20mins without traffic). We found it to be somewhat centralized so we could see a lot of different neighborhoods (Koreatown, Chelsea, Hudson yards, West Village, Murray Hill, Midtown...etc.) The Citi Bikes were close by and a convenient mode of transport to the surrounding areas, use the Lyft App it costs $3/30mins. My only slight issue with the hotel is there were only 2 elevators on our floor (floor 22), so it took quite a long time to come & go. (I have stayed at The Moxy Chelsea and there are easily 2-3 times more elevators for the same high rise hotel). The elevators also lacked air conditioning, so it was always hot & stuffy.On my next visit I might checkout the Arlo in SoHo or the Freehand or Ave nearby.","Atlanta, Georgia","laurenaolaya</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",45,4.0

Let’s be clear, this is a semitypical New York City hotel with small hotel rooms. They make no qualms about letting you know that your space is not going to be palatial. When I first checked into the hotel, I went into this knowing that the rooms were going to be small. What I didn’t expect, when I finally got to my room, was that I was staying in a very very small space that I simply could not tolerate from more than one night. I contacted the front desk in spoke to an agent by the name of Angie Ramos. She literally turned a negative experience into an amazing one and because of her, this hotel has my business for life. They moved me into a larger room and not only did so graciously and happily, she followed up to make sure my room was OK, hand-delivered the keys, and also went out of her way to make sure the rest of my stay was a good one.

I really love the location of this hotel as it’s practically in the middle of everything, its two blocks down from the Empire state building, easy walk 7 minutes’ walk to the Flat Iron and a nice walk up to central park. Perfect base in my eyes. I’ve stayed in one of the basic rooms on level 13 with an “Urban View”, the room was tiny. My boyfriend and I was able to manage but it was a bit of a struggle at times. Urban View basically means you can see the back of apartment buildings, a lot of air con ducts and no view of the skyline. In the room you have toiletries that Arlo have had made by Blind Barber, the scent of the cream is the same scent of the lobby. I took one of the hand creams home with me, every time I used it memories of NYC came flooding back. We have previously stayed in a “City View” room on the 23rd floor and that was a perfect size with an amazing view, we could see the empire state building from the room. I would highly recommend spending a little bit more to get a good sized room with a view. The actual hotel smells amazing, I really love the chilled laid back vibe. I’m not a fan of huge chain hotels with massive grand foyers. I like cool, chic and high end vibes and this is what you get at the Arlo Nomad. It’s completely tucked away, so you can’t tell it’s there. The reception staff are really helpful. They have a basket of charges and adapters to borrow – very helpful. The rooftop bar wasn’t open this visit, but we went previously and it was really cool. The bar served yummy cocktails and the view is magical. We went up at night time, I could have sat there looking at the city lights twinkling for hours. One complaint I do have is the lifts, there is only two lifts a lot of rooms. You have to wait a fair amount of time whenever you need to go up or down. There is often a queue on the ground floor for the lifts but this isn’t something they can change nor is it something that would stop me from going back.","London, United Kingdom","lolagx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,4.0

What’s more, we had the breakfast included in our room rate and still each morning we were getting a full receipt including tips for the staff. I don’t mind tipping the staff, but there was no service provided as it was a buffet breakfast. I have never come across anything like it – very unprofessional & not a good practice especially for what we’ve paid for our stay. In the end the breakfast cost was not charged to our room after I complained at the reception. Check-in – very little information provided while checking in, we were not told about happy hours and any other facilities the hotel provides, and didn’t use any of that due to the lack of information. The roof top bar was one of the reasons we chose the hotel, but there was no communication prior to our stay of it being closed - we expected it should be open at the beginning of May. The room was really small though when booking the hotel we knew what to expect. We still found the King Sky room sufficient for our needs, we just had to unpack wisely:) However the ergonomic of the room would need a bit of improvement, i.e. gigantic TV screen right next to the bathroom doors, which made coming in/ out of the bathroom a bit awkward.","County Kilkenny, Ireland","IsabelKK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>County Kilkenny, Ireland</strong>",3,3.0

He had come to New York for business and I joined him for the trip. Ihave listed below the positives and negatives about the hotel:Positives:- The location is fantastic and close to key avenues in NYC and tourist attractions as well as to the subway.- There is an amazing view from the hotel roof top of the Empire State Building.- Some of the staff are particularly welcoming and friendly. - There was a beautiful lounge area in which you could sit and have drinks with sofas and games.- There was free happy hour in the bar from 5 - 7 and you could get unlimited snacks and wine!- Although some of the staff were a little confused about the fitness options I was given a Zeamo account which gave access to lots of local gyms nearby - this was great!Negatives:- The main negative which would honestly prevent us from staying at Arlo Nomad again we’re the elevators which were painfully slow. Often we would have to wait around 5 - 10 minutes for it to arrive and sometimes it was so full we couldn’t get in. This needs to be addressed! - Although the hotel makes it very clear that the room sizes are small on the website, make sure you are prepared for exactly how small. There is no wardrobe, for example, just a gap with 5 or so hangers.- Some of the staff weren’t able to tell us about the fitness options available and in one instance we were told we were booked onto a class at Tone House but never were. They just seemed a bit confused by the different options available. Zeamo worked well though (although you can’t do classes with this).To sum up, we had a lovely time at Arlo Nomad and thank you for accommodating us. We would not book again due to the elevators but if these got sorted I would certainly come again! It is also definitely better if you are a lone traveller (due to the size of the rooms) and definitely for leisure rather than business as there is nowhere to hang your suit! Thanks again though!","London, United Kingdom","mary_henshall</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,3.0

A gentleman called Sebastian from the reservations team sorted us a fantastic price for my girlfriends 21st Birthday and my first time in New York. A guy called Benjamin was also very helpful with our room change and emailed me with any changes or to let me know when the room was ready. Nothing was too much of an ask. The door staff and each person on reception each day were friendly and always smiling. The layout and trendy appearance of the hotel was exceptional. The smell as soon as you walked into the hotel was amazing as well. Wish we bought a candle!!! The location does not lie. It is central Manhattan, a stones throw from Empire State and fifth avenue with a fantastic shop around the corner called Bread and Butter for breakfast or little bits. The standout feature has to be the rooftop terrace. We were jetlagged on our first morning so were awake by 6am. We managed to ask a member of staff to have a quick look on the rooftop and were blown away with the view, especially when the sun came up! Don't know what else to say. 10/10 stay with no issues!

If you are considering staying here then you have to now!!Firstly, the NoMad is in a great location. As first time visitors to NYC we weren’t sure about which area to stay in. The hotel is within walking distance to all the main sites. Most days we were able to go back to the hotel after a long days walk to chill out and then go out again for dinner. It’s only Two blocks away from the subway which made it easy to get to and from the airport with all our luggage. The hotel very kindly gave us a room upgrade to a high floor city view, which was so nice to arrive to after a long day of travelling. All the staff were so friendly, helpful all week with anything we needed. The hotel has a late check out time of 12pm and They let us leave our luggage with them whilst we had our last day as our flight wasn’t until the evening. 24hr bodega for all your coffee and bagel needs. The best, I repeat, the BEST view of the city from the rooftop. You’ll struggle to find a closer, less interrupted view of the Empire State Building. Everyday digital detox at the bar, offering free Prosecco and pizza for hotel guests? Yes please! Most days we made sure we were back at the hotel for this!Probably the most asked subject is the room size. I thought it was more than adequate for two people for a whole week (and my husband is 6”7). Yes it is probably smaller than other hotel rooms in the City, but it has everything you would ever need. The space has been cleverly maximised to give you enough storage for luggage and clothes. USB ports means you don’t have to bother with adapters. Hair dryer and steamers are in all the rooms. As one review said when I was researching this hotel, it may have less room space than other hotels, but who cares? You don’t go to NYC to stay in the hotel room 24/7All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone.

It's a true boutique hotel with a free happy hour for the guests and a rooftop with awesome view of Manhattan. Starting from the check-in and to the check-out, everything was PERFECT! Steven Lantigua gave us a complimentary upgrade for a special occasion for which I was traveling with my partner. The room has great views overlooking the stunning Empire State building and good size room to easily accomodate two people. The bathroom was rather spacious and toiletries were really nice too. Upon arrival, we found a bottle of prosecco and chocolate to welcome us for the special occasion. It was incredible. We were also offered 20% discount on food and beverages at the hotel restaurant which also offers really nice food. Given it's a nightmare to get a reservation anywhere in Manhattan, it was super good to have the hotel restaurant. The lounge area of the hotel is cool with nice decor and chilled vibe. I really enjoyed staying at the hotel and can not recommend enough for anyone to stay there too. Try to book via the hotel site directly which offers great discounts and deals.

All I can say is wow wow wow. I was a bit nervous as I’d had to book secretly for wife’s 40th but no need From arriving late and very tired on Wednesday to a very friendly welcome staff simply are the best. Got given our room and simply enquired if we could possibly go a little higher which was greeted with come and see us in morning and see what we can do. Room was lovely clean and well laid out and beds so comfortable. Next morning popped down and enquired about going higher and was told to come back in afternoon to see what they could do for us. Left bags packed and came back for the news just to get better than ever expected bags moved. They had moved us to 29th floor and opened curtain to see Empire State just the best view of such an iconic building.Afternoon detox in bar is great chance to chill out and have wine and nibbles on house. Bar staff lovely friendly and welcoming. The whole experience of this hotel is amazing and just added to the holiday. I could recommend this hotel to anyone you will not regret it. Just need to save up and we will be back as soon as possible. One final comment they also recommend us a private transfer back to airport as we didn’t want the pre booked minibus as took too long. This was another bonus as lovely safe transfer in comfort and not to expensive Thank you for making this so special for my wife and I. Richard and carla cole,,Richard7461,1,5.0

We were there to see the A-10 basketball tournament at the Barclays Center which was an easy walk to Harold Square, 4 stops and as you ride up on the escalator, there was the entrance to the arena. Could not have been easier. Fantastic restaurants near the hotel. The staff is exceptional. We will definitely return!

First of all, we booked a queen standard room but emailed if it was possible to get a room with a view (as it was my birthday weekend). They responded quickly and offered us free upgrade to a city view room, so kind! We actually were given one of their best rooms (29th floor, highest floor) with views from our bed at the Empire State Building and beautiful skyline of NY. I’ll never forget this view and loved waking up to it every morning. They even left me a birthday card and chocolates as well! And that smell in the hotel.. I miss that smell haha, it always smelled so fresh everywhere.Some people complain about the room size and although the rooms aren’t big, they surely are big enough. We weren’t bothered by it at all and actually thought the rooms were stylish, cosy, very clean and the bathroom was quite big actually. We had enough space to leave our luggage.Staff is so friendly trying to make your stay as pleasant as possible. Another big plus is the daily digital detox from 17.30-18.00 at the bar. Free wine, Prosecco and bites for hotel guests. Perfect after a long day of exploring! Location is perfect for exploring NY and close to the subway. There’s lots of nice restaurants in the area and you can also have dinner at Massoni’s, downstairs. Nice bars are a bit harder to find (not impossible though) in this area but you can get to Soho within 5 minutes by taxi, metro or walking for about 30-40 minutes.Lastly, the rooftop has stunning views and can be accessed easily from the top floor. During summer there’s a bar but right now you can just enter it to watch the spectacular views.Can’t recommend this place enough and advised all my friends and family to go here when visiting NYC :)","Groningen, The Netherlands","JennyCBek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Groningen, The Netherlands</strong>",8,5.0

On that, kudos to the team. I have to mention that this is my second time staying at the property, the experience was still awesome.

When I woke up in the morning, I had a lovely message from Mateo asking us to go have a chat with him before we headed out for the morning. Mateo was the night manager. He was my favourite person we met on the whole trip. He totally understood our issues and told us he'd be able to change our room for when we got back that evening.When we arrived back we went to our new room and were so overwhelmed with delight - we had a view of the Empire State Building.

If it wasn't for Mateo being so understanding and kind we wouldn't have had as unforgettable a trip as we ended up having. We were so disappointed we weren't able to see Mateo after that one and only meeting that morning. We wanted to give him a hug, take a selfie with him and say thank you in person.

We booked online after a quick Google search, and loved (1) the budget friendly price, (2) the awesome location right by K-town where we stuffed our faces, (3) cozy & creative design/decor of the space. The in-person experience was even better. People are kind, service is quick, and we were pleasantly surprised throughout our 1-night stay. Hot chocolate in the lobby to greet us, free champagne/wine for happy hour on the second floor (Yes, please!). Also appreciated that they had taken up our bags (that we had left when we arrived too early for check in) to our room as soon as it was ready. My friend and I booked the Bunk Beds. Though the room was smaller than anticipated, it didn't bother us in the least. It was clean, cute, cozy. Beds are comfortable with a television in each. The *only* downside, if any, was that the bathroom is enclosed by a frosted glass door that's a bit see-through and doesn't quite give you the privacy you want when going you-know-what. We laughed it off and turned on the television loud when the time(s) came. We made our ""Let's always stay here when we're in NYC"" declaration after dinner in their restaurant MASSONI - where again we were pleasantly surprised by the ambience but more importantly the PIZZA. Deep dish & delightful, crunchy & soft in all the right spots. We had the Prosciutto and Broccoli Rabe pizzas - highly recommend. The Riceball appetizers were also delish.It was a quick trip for us, so unfortunately we weren't able to experience all their amenities and enjoy all the cozy places they have spread around the hotel to hang out, relax or work.

We booked a room, checked in and did actually go to our room. Unbeknownst to us, this is considered a ""micro hotel"". I had never heard of this before. We walked into the room and if I had to guess it was around 150sq.ft. For those of you who are confused, this amounts to a 10' x 15' room (total of bathroom, bedroom, king bed, etc.). You literally have to climb over the bed to get to the other side. The bed is surrounded by the wall on the back, window on the side and window on the front. There is no room to walk around the bed. There are also no closets to speak of or really any room to lay out your suitcase. Within 5 minutes we had booked a room at a nearby hotel and left. The hotel itself is very ""young"" and ""hip"". If you are young and ok with the room size then the hotel will be great for you.

The reviews say small rooms. Really? I stayed on a catamaran that had a bigger bedroom. So, what you need to know is that this is a “micro hotel”. What?? I didn’t know these existed.

Compact as others have mentioned and cold without the fan on. I think we also benefitted from construction work being on hold over the holidays as on the last 2 days, which were usual working days, we were woken at 7 by building in 2 nearby buildings. But, that’s all part of the Manhattan experience we figured and I didn’t tire at all of the view.The room was always clean and the toiletries etc high quality. There was no tea/coffee or facilities to make them. The roof bar wasn’t open but you could go up there for photos and there were some cool little private igloos but we didn’t work out how the worked. We took part in the lobby drinks on 3/4 days and discovered the cute lounge on the 2nd floor only on our last day of doing this. It was decorated like an xmas lounge and was really cosy.We didn’t eat at the restaurant or use the bodega so can’t comment on that.We had minimal contact with the staff but they were helpful when we did. They booked our airport taxi and gave a good induction when we arrived. Location is good. Really handy for midtown and within 5 mins walk of 2 subway stations. Lots of places nearby for a cheaper NY breakfast and in the heart of Korea town so lots of restaurants. Price wise, we could have got cheaper but think you’re paying for how they’ve used the space and a much more modern and interesting experience than with the bigger chains who are in the same price bracket. All in all, really enjoyed it. ","London, United Kingdom","Aimius</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",37,5.0

There are a few Nomads so make sure your Uber driver gets the right one, otherwise you end up at the wrong Nomad.

Check-In is blood simple, no issues. They have a cool little upscale snack bar area right there. More cool restaurants in the back along with an upstairs common library area which my wife used for a private dance practice (I mean others were there but no one cared),, then a very cool bar upstairs too with a seating area out of MOMA with retro lighting and plush bean type sofas/couches. Anyhow, my wife ordered a standard room and what I got was a whole lot more than I bargained for.Walked into room and you know NYC rooms are small and this was on the medium small size but just enough. However, I had a corner room on like the 22nd floor and there literally was floor to ceiling windows on both sides of the corner and that was over the top. You feel like you're floating above NYC with a panoramic view of the city. This room is not for the timid, so if glass elevators / heights bother you this may be much.

The cherry on top of this awesome cake was really the staff - nothing was too much trouble for them and they were always happy to help!

I came across Arlo NoMad, saw pictures of their rooms, affordable price (especially for what you get) and didn't hesitate. I ended up booking their King City View room but called them to inquire on how much it would be to upgrade to the SkyView a few times, and if there was one even available. My birthday and anniversary both fell on the week that I was staying at the hotel so I when I saw the SkyView online it just seemed perfect. I called right before our flight just to see if there was an available King SkyView room available and they let me know they went ahead and already upgraded my room for free. That left me speechless. They were already so kind up until that point and I was 100% not expecting it and was so excited. After arriving to the hotel, the check-in was a breeze, they were incredibly friendly, and since I was there very early, they held onto my bags while we went to the restaurant wait for the room to be available. When we walked into the room, it was perfect. Just enough space, super comfortable bed, a beautiful view and very minimalistic style. The hotel placement was convenient and overall just perfect. I couldn't have stayed at a more perfect hotel. What made this even more memorable is I became a fiancé on their roof and felt like the Arlo staff was just as excited as I was that they seriously became family.

The hotel appears to be fairly new and has a very hip and trendy vibe when you first enter the lobby. We had a standard Queen Room which was fairly basic but also very small - note we couldn't even open two suit cases at a time (the bed pretty much takes up the whole space). Having said that the room itself was clean and tidy and had all the necessary facilities needed for a comfortable stay. What was most disappointing was that the hotel staff did not advise of the special offers and complementary access guests had to certain facilities - such as gym access which we only found out about on our last day. Also, the elevators in the building are EXCEEDINGLY slow - we would often have to wait for over 15 minutes in the mornings to be able to hop into a lift that wasn't full (we were staying on level 9 and the lifts were more often than not full by the time they came down from level 29) - very frustrating. Location-wise the hotel is fairly centrally-located in mid-town with the closest subway stop being 33rd street on the green line. Overall the hotel was satisfactory but the hotel needs to do a bit more to engage with its guests in order to give them the best experience.","Brisbane, Australia","hansjlarsson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",27,4.0

And I feel like their vibe rubs off because the folks I ran into in the elevator or in the restaurant or in the comfortable work/hangout spaces were all relaxed and fun to interact with. I picked the Arlo because I knew I'd need to work a lot this trip and would probably want to get out of my room but not go too far. This hotel has several great spots to plop down with your laptop and the whole place seems to have great wifi (included in the ""urban fee""). I don't think the pictures do the common areas on the mezzanine justice, maybe because sometimes the lighting is soft? They're fairly spacious and each one is quite different. So I hung out by the electric fireplace with a blanket in a cozy chair for awhile, then joined some folks in the more traditional work room at one of the tables, then spread out on a sofa in the mezzanine bar. I thought I'd especially want those common areas because the rooms are so small--and honestly I was nervous about that. And then I fell in love with my room. I talked to another guest at dinner (great restaurant btw--deserves a whole other review) who stays here regularly and she said the same thing. I ended up loving how tidy and well designed the space is--it felt like a nest and I slept great here. I has been hoping for a Sky Room, though--which is what I thought I]d booked-- and Zack at the front desk saw I was disappointed and said he'd see what he could do. The place was booked packed but the next day he told me to pack up my bags and they'd take care of everything and when I got back, I'd be in a new room. So after a very long day of meetings and trying to get back to the hotel during the first winter storm of the season, I walked into my sky room on the 29th floor and it was like finding myself in a beautiful snow globe--looking out on the Empire State Building. It felt like my birthday! It's so lovely that I went down to the bar, where Asa patiently talk me through every dish on the menu until we landed on the perfect dinner for this evening--braised kale and wild mushrooms with an egg yolk to stir in and finish the sauce--and I headed straight back to my gorgeous view. Last rave--and I know this is very much personal taste--but they play great music here.","Seattle, Washington","mommagogo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",9,5.0

Overall, it's fine but mediocre experience. I would give 3.5 stars if I could. I recommend getting a higher room or non-street side room as there is construction on 31st street for a new building. They start at 7am and go to midnight on weekdays. This is not the first hotel I've stayed at in NYC where this was an issue so not blaming Arlo for this. First, the check-in. We got there after 3pm and our room was not ready. In fact a lot of people were waiting for rooms. We were given free coffee vouchers and told to wait. Eventually, I could tell we were forgotten as everyone else got their key card. This is fine as I just lined up again and the reception person said he was just about to give us our keys (haha ok - more like I lined up again so you had to help me). The room was both fine and horrible. First, one of my pillows was lumpy. So lumpy I could feel the lumps just lightly resting my arm on it while sitting on the bed. There's 2 per person so I just used the other one but really shocked by this. And the bed is NOT a queen. I'm 5foot5 (or 165cm) and my feet were just about to hang off the bed. I would feel sorry for anyone actually tall that is staying in these rooms. The heater/AC was really loud. I was also awakened by the sound of pipes when other people were using their showers. I was impressed they woke up so early to be honest. The room itself is very clean so I really liked that. The umbrella was nice to use because it was pouring on one day. The sink is in the hallway of the room but we knew that when we booked so it's not a big deal. Elevators were fine as we were only on the 6th floor and there is 1 elevator that can only go up to 8th floor. It's actually faster than getting a higher room. I noticed they had to wait a lot longer. Overall, this hotel has great aesthetics in a central location convenient to go everywhere. However, the room experience itself was only passable. Perhaps it was because we were not in an more expensive view room. I don't know. I probably wouldn't come back to find out. I don't think anyone will care since the hotel is so full.

The lobby and restaurant area are beautiful and our room was very clean, stylish, and up to date. To me, there's nothing worse than an out-of-date, barely clean, used up hotel room and this was not a concern at Arlo. The Blind Barber products were lovely and the view is awesome. Literally the only thing you sacrifice with this hotel is space and we were fine with that because we wanted to be in the city as much as possible. It feels like a small space luxury hotel. Also....THE ROOFTOP BAR! I lived in NYC for two years and have been on many rooftops and this is still one of the most beautiful views I've ever seen of the Empire State Building. We will definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to family and friends. Thank you, Arlo NoMad! <3",,Global697837,2,5.0

Our overnight flight into New York resulted in our arriving at the hotel well in advance of the standard check-in but the front desk team were extremely accommodating and got us into our room shortly thereafter. We reserved a corner room which, while small (feels a little like a cruise ship stateroom), provided everything we needed and an excellent view. While there we visited the hotel restaurant for breakfast, lunch and dinner and each experience was excellent ... both in terms of the menu options, food quality and wait staff knowledge and interaction.

With an overall positive experience, I will say that it can get noisy. i experienced some doors slamming and loud yelling in the wee hours of the morning (past 3:00 am). However, when I mentioned this to the front desk associate the morning I checked out, she was extremely apologetic and accommodating and offered me free breakfast and coffee. She also reached out to me later on and told me to let her know if I was ever returning so that she could get me a good deal.

We met up in the morning and I assumed it would be too early to get our room, but I knew they would store our bags. First pleasant surprise was that they did have a room ready for us! Liz, at our check-in, was so upbeat and sweet and adorable that I could hardly focus on what she was saying; her attitude was infectious. Apparently, she gave us a different room that what was originally planned, along with two free drink tickets at the swanky bar on second floor because we were also celebrating my daughter's 21st birthday. The hotel is very modern and techy; had to swipe card and enter floor info to get on the elevator. We approached our room with excitement and it turned out to be a corner with TWO walls of floor to ceiling windows. The bed pretty much takes up most of the room; it is compact but everything is there and the fixtures are very hip and clean. We usually don't spend much time in the hotel anyway, but I wanted to. We headed out; the location of the Arlo Nomad is great; close to Madison Square Park, subways and Penn. It is an area that I hadn't previously explored much and I really like it. The rooftop bar has a great view and can only be accessed with a key card, which is kind of nice. The clubby bar on the second floor is really beautiful along with a very nice common area across the way to sit and work if need be. The bartender made us some great drinks for our two freebies and was fun to watch and talk to (sorry I don't remember her name but she was great).

Urban fee - I don't know what this is, we were not charged and urban fee. Room city/state taxes are normal for hotels no matter where you travel.2. Smelly - Someone complained that the area outside of the hotel is smelly. Unless you've been living under a rock you'll know that Manhattan has been under a heat advisory for a few weeks. We stayed from September 1 - 8 and it was 38-41 Celsius with humidity every day except 7 and 8. Guess what everyone, heat + garbage = smelly surroundings. Manhattan is city on a island with no where for the garbage to go except on the street to be picked up. There is no room for bins. This is not the hotel's fault (neither is homelessness). The hotel smells absolutely fantastic every time you walk in the front door.3. The rooms are small - oh my goodness have you not done you research? The rooms are exactly as described so if you are disappointed with the size that is your fault not the hotel's. Now for my review.1. Check-in: Fast and friendly. My only suggestion would be to explain how the blinds in the room work when guests check-in.2. The hotel: was awesome. It is decorated very tastefully. There is adequate space for everyone and includes a reception/check in area, library for quiet relaxation, a great 2nd floor bar area where you can order food and again a lounge area. The only downside of the 2nd floor is all the external clientele waiting for an elevator to get to the rooftop bar but not a deal breaker.3. The elevators/roof top bar: wait was not bad as they dedicate on to the rooftop bar when it's really busy. Rooftop bar has an excellent view of the empire state building and city. Mainly mixed sugary drinks/beer and some wine. We ordered red wine one night and had to send it back as it was corked due to the heat, we had no issues from the bar staff. Can be loud but you should go at night for the views.4. The rooms: are small but have some great storage solutions. We had to suitcases which fit under the bed, the bed frame had a pull out piece on each side for drinks, there were hooks for bags or your hat or whatever and it had an area to hang your clothes and store your shoes and any extra stuff above. I thought it layout was brilliant. Bathroom is not very private so just be prepared.5. Massoni: We were really happy with the service and the food. If you are eating here everyday that is a problem as there are some absolutely amazing restaurants close by, Korea town is right next door.Downside: I agree that the wedding that took place was very disruptive for guests of the hotel. There should be dedicated service staff for guests when they want a drink from the bar so we don't have to put both elbows up and shove in to get service.What else? Location is great, hotel is clean, bed was comfy!...centrally located, easy to take the subway uptown and downtown. I think next time we will check out Arlo SoHo!","Calgary, Canada","bergak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",43,5.0

There was no one around with drinks due to the wedding (not a problem) so I went to the packed bar filled with wedding party guests. When I finally had my turn to order both the grouchy/busy bar staff said that free drinks did not exist at happy hour and that beer and wine was just a better price and what I was told was wrong.

The second floor has a fairly popular bar.We’ve opted for the queen room for our stays. The sink is located outside of the bathroom area, which includes the shower and toilet, enclosed with a sliding glass door. Note to those who value privacy – the sliding glass door is not the best at being sound-proof. The room itself has the basic essentials with a comfortable bed and large-screen TV, and the large window gives a decent view. Overall, despite the low square footage, the room itself doesn’t feel too cramped. Noise from the hallway or adjacent rooms has never been an issue for us.(2) ServiceThe front desk has always been helpful and friendly during our stays. The elevators have an interesting system where you enter your desired floor at a kiosk in front, on the lobby floor, perhaps to make things more efficient. However, the elevators can be slow and cramped, as there are primarily 2 elevators that reach the higher floors. At times there could be a decent line on the lobby floor.(3) FoodWe’ve dined at the in-hotel restaurant once for breakfast, which had a decent hot breakfast selection. Filling, but not particularly special. Given the local options, we typically opted to dine out.(4) AmenitiesThere’s a rooftop deck which has great views and is typically very popular at night. We didn’t see an in-house gym.(5) Location/ConvenienceThis has typically been the key factor for us when choosing hotels in NYC. The hotel is a short walk away from Penn Station, and we love the hotel’s easy access to the great restaurants and night life in Koreatown.","Boston, Massachusetts","relax_the_smile</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",15,4.0

But I do have to point out that there wasn't anyone helping me carry the luggage in (not I had a lot either) and while I was waiting to pick up my valet upon departure, I also didn't see any door man up front for a good 15 min wait.

They have a busy rooftop bar that monopolizes one elevator for long periods of time, and one morning when I needed to get downstairs to meet someone it took more than 10 minutes. After the first night, I expressed my frustration to the front desk host, Bre’Ana, and she offered to change my room to a lower floor (there is one elevator that only serves the lower 8 floors). I initially declined because I did not want to pack up everything in my room, but later decided to take her up on the offer. When I got to my new room, she had left a nice note and some delicious treats to help make up for it! I definitely appreciated that they wanted to be sure I was happy with my stay.

Firstly, you would be expected to wait on avg. 5-8 min for the lifts and they move as slowly as ancient, antique lifts.As for the staff service, when collecting our luggage from the Concierge, we had to wait 20 min for them. It turned out that our luggage was stored on 4th floor and due to limited lift access, we had to wait through that 20 min. When we tried to double check on the luggage’s status, we were responded with “you are not the only one waiting for your luggage you know” and fair enough - 8 other guests were waiting for their luggage too. However, we do not believe that should be the normal and fair customer service. Lastly, the aircon was noisy and we were kept awake the first two nights of our stay, so we recommend against here for light sleepers.

The hotel has an amazing roof top view but unfortunately you don’t have to stay at the hotel to go up there. The elevators were constantly PACKED and slow. At night we often waited 10-15 minutes just to exit because 3 cars would come by completely full.

Paolo (hope I spelled that right), thanks for being so sweet, and for being so helpful when we had questions about the city. Janelle, as I mentioned when we met you-YOU ARE FAMOUS!..and deserve every bit of it!- Kiara, working the Bodega, made us feel like we were about the only two people on earth; one of our 3 nights there, we told her we would be coming down earlier than the night before to get our snacks. When we made it down, she says to us, ""I was waitin' for y'all!"" This treatment might not have meant much to some, but it meant a whole lot to us. The girls working the Massoni were sweet, also, but our go-to for some meals, bottled water before & after our treks around the city, NYC style cheesecake, etc., was the Bread & Butter at the corner of 5th & 31st. The Bread & Butter popped up quite a bit in the reviews I read before our trip, so I thought we just had to check 'em out. Our Sky Room: The view from the room was breathtaking! At night, we'd leave the windows open for the city noise. This IS a micro hotel, but we had more space than expected.

My fiance and I spent one night here and it was the best experience I've ever had with staying at a hotel in New York City. The service was phenomenal, highlighted mainly by the very gracious and super-friendly front desk agent Paola, who let us check in over 3 hours early. Check-in and check-out was speedy, and they let us check our bags for free all day each day, even when we were past our stay. Our room was pristine and the sky view was incredible. We have stayed in much more expensive luxury hotels in Battery Park, Times Square, and Chelsea, but this view was by far the most incredible. The room also offers great amenities despite its small size, with lots of towels and toiletries complimentary. The room also includes a refrigerator, safe, hairdryer, and clothing steamer. The thing we were both very impressed with was the quality of the bed, which was a shock to us both. It was so comfortable and we both slept ten times better than we do at home!The rooftop bar was beautiful and offers a tremendous view of the Empire State Building. In the lobby, the hotel also features a cafe with delicious pastries, sandwiches, pizza by the slice, and great coffee for a good price. Location is prime as well, as it is close to almost anything you need and cabs are always readily available. There are plenty of attractions within walking distance, including the Flatiron building, Empire State Building, Madison Square Park & Garden, Museum of Sex, and fifth avenue shopping. The walk to Penn Station takes only minutes, which was great since we came by train. Overall, we could not have had a better experience at the Arlo. The friendly and attentive service, aura, and cleanliness of the hotel has put this at the top of my list for places to stay in the city.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to NYC, especially couples. This was a great way to spend our anniversary in a quaint, luxurious, and special place, and we will definitely be coming back!","Providence, Rhode Island","Kassie and Bria...

The room is small (this is a given with these types of hotels), though must say it's well thought out and uses the space to it's advantage. I actually didn't mind the room, had a nice view, shower was great, storage space just enough and overall clean and tidy. My only complaint was the bedding. Pillows were so flat (felt like i needed 10 of them) and the duvet was lacking any warmth. Am used to the comfort of plump pillows and plush duvets, these were neither. The elevators were a bit of an issue, long wait times and cards not always scanning properly inside. Biggest complaint was the lack of sound proofing in the hallways... Though made for some interesting listening sessions if that's your thing. Pluses were definitely the roof top bar and views, also the hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. Situated in midtown makes for easy travel uptown or down, and quick walks to local markets and shops.

Yes, room is small as other reviewers mentioned but it’s New York. More you pay, you get a better view and larger room. I recommend city view for bigger window and slightly better view overlooking the buildings. And another controversial thing about this hotel - There’s not so much privacy for shower and toilet so stay with close friends or someone who knows you. I had no issue or problem during my stay, but it can be a little awkward if you’re not comfortable hearing or seeing the silhouette of someone’s business. During my stay, hotel was crowded with tourists and lobby was always full with people so there was no place to sit or relax. However, you can go to the second floor and there’s a lobby-like room you can sit and work on your task. Pros: modern, clean, and efficient room with natural sunlight. Location near the K-town and other sightseeing places, really central location. Fairly low noise level. Cons: busy hotel, tiny room and bathroom; best for couple or solo traveler.

We were greeted by a member of their Lobby Crew by the name of Miguel. He was absolutely amazing. We arrived quite early at about 8 am. So we stopped by the hotel to drop off our bags. He booked us a reservation for a steak house, and even included that it was for a special occasion (it turned out to be awesome we got free desert!). He gave us the lay of the land and helped us get a head start when it came to using the subway system, and even gave us a free subway map. So check-in was at 3 pm; we came back to the hotel around 2:30 just so that we knew we would be ready to check in right at 3 pm to get showered and prepared for out reservation (unfortunately Miguel wasn't there). We went to the Massoni and had a few drinks. around 3 pm I scooted back up to the front desk and our room was not ready yet. I totally understood we were on the 26th floor, I was okay with waiting another half an hour no big deal right. So around 3:30-3:40 I went back up to the front desk and the room still wasn't ready we were asked to wait another 30 minutes, I was a little frustrated at this point we were hot, we were so not ready to show up at the reservation without a little relax time and time to get ready. So we had another drink. I went back at about 4 pm; YET AGAIN OUR ROOM WAS NOT CLEANED OR READY YET. At this point I was just utterly astounded. We not only have been waiting in the hotel for about an hour and a half but our room hasn't even been cleaned. When we were finally able to get up to our room, it was beautiful but we really didn't have much time to enjoy it. Saturday started off great we left pretty early to go out and explore the city. When we got back at around 3pm someone was in our room for 30 minutes changing sheets and towels even though we had not requested this. It was also a little frustrating seen as how they have it posted that it wouldn't happen unless we contacted to front desk and asked for it to. Check out was great Miguel was there he called us a taxi, asked us about our weekend, gave his apologies for our check-in experience and promptly waited for out taxi to get there and helped us get our bags in the back and really made us feel like we were an appreciated consumer.

Even before we arrived it was a very positive experience. We had an arrival date change enforced upon us by our airline and as we'd already paid a non refundable rate I let the hotel know just as a matter of courtesy. However, having sent them proof the changes were out of our control the booking was amended within a couple of hours. It really was very slick customer service.On arrival, we were too early to get in our room but it was no problem checking in, leaving our bags safely at reception and wandering off into the city. It's a simple thing that often seems to be a problem for hotels, reasons for which I never understand, but here, it was just 'no problem Sir, go have fun and come back when you're ready'. They even offered to contact us when the room was ready. There was no need but the offer was appreciated. We were only on a short 3 night stay which was totally uneventful in regards to issues with the hotel. The two things that seem to get mentioned on reviews are the size of the rooms and the elevators. Firstly, the rooms are small, but the layout works very well and it does add a certain quirkiness to the experience. It's not like it feels claustrophobic with the floor to ceiling glass on two sides and it is possible that coming from the UK, the smaller room sizes are less of a shock. Secondly, the elevators, and to be honest we never really had an problem with wait times but we were there mid week and I assume it is possibly worse on weekends. There does seem to be a process in place that, to a point, controls access to the roof bar that I assume is cut down on people just riding the elevator for the view, which is fantastic, and not the bar. I have no problem with that and as guests of the hotel access to the roof is unrestricted. It should also be mentioned, that if it's your first time in NYC, as it was for us, and you've scratched your tourist itch by doing the observation decks of the Empire State or Top of the Rock, then a couple of minute wait for the hotel lift will seem like very small potatoes.","Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom","bennettphotography</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southend-on-Sea, United Kingdom</strong>",11,5.0

For the price and location it is good. The staff are pleasant and helpful enough but feel at check in they could give you a little more info about the facilities etc, but that’s not a complaint, only a suggestion.However, I do want to flag up a major disappointment; you cannot boast roof top bars/lounges and then deny guests access to them. The theme for me over the 3 nights spent in the Arlo have been as the image below... excluding. Night one - rain, so could not access roof terrace - fair enough, second floor lounge out of bounds for private event, bar rammed as a result. That said, managed to get 3 stools at the bar once the crowd had subsided a little.(more on that below - great barman) Night 2 - roof top open, we were told till 12, but not told drinks stop at 1130 - but were reminded by the gruff rooftop barman we were too late at 1135. Seems crazy to me to turn away business especially when bad weather can limit access on ones stay. I didn’t rate the roof terrace (bearded) barman, especially when we spotted him topping up someone else’s drinks. We were not the only guests to notice. Night 3 - Roof top closed - private event, lounge floor 2 the same. None of this is a problem if there are other spaces to use other than one packed bar/small restaurant (because the other spaces were closed to guests). Think the hotels advertising is thus misleading. We could not make use of the things we had booked for. Be aware - worth checking if you want to fully use the facilities.Other reviews may have noted - but the lifts can take an age to arrive. I would like to say thanks to the staff though for being jolly and helpful. The barman in the ground floor bar is top and nothing was too much trouble.I would probably try other hotels if visiting again, purely to gain a little more ambience/space in general including the entrance/lounge area - it gets congested with little seating. I work late when in NY so often not back till 1030 and appreciate a decent beer and snack in some space.

Whilst this is a fairly cheap hotel located right in the thick of Manhattan, I am still not sure it offers value. The rooms are spartan and tiny. Like where do I put my suitcase tiny. Fine perhaps if you are a solo business traveller but as a couple staying 4 nights it felt pretty soul-destroying, to the extent that we decided to take the hit of the non-refundable booking and move to the real Nomad Hotel the next day for the remainder of our stay in NY. Twice the price but way more than twice the value. As an aside, when we were leaving c5.30pm on a Thursday, it took us 25 minutes(!) to get from the 28th floor where out room was located to the lobby. The two elevators are woefully inadequate for the traffic generated by the many hotel guests and visitors to the popular rooftop bar. It is a design flaw that will dog this place for the entirety of its existence and frustrate guests on upper floors who just want to get down - allow an extra 15 minutes to get to any meetings at peak times.

The shower was wonderful, as were the linens and toiletries.The only change we would suggest would be pegs on one of the walls in the bed area for longer coats or dresses as the closet is only shirt length.

Room is small but not to a point that should bother any single traveller, and hotel is fairly priced accordingly. My only comment would be the lifts could be slow sometime (once took me 20 minutes to go up) and walls are thin enough that you can hear if someone in next room is using the shower, but these are negligible points for what was a pleasant efficient stay.","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","Memoirsofatravelbug1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai, United Arab Emirates</strong>",24,4.0

We stayed at the Arlo Nomad. We got two rooms...one for us (a queen) and one for our grown kids (bunkbed room). The rooms were both very well thought out, comfortable, clean and perfect albeit the Queen was particularly small. The bunkbed room was totally cute, with a great use of a window to really open up the space. There were issues with our first day being the first day that the roof bar opened, so the elevators were really jammed and it took quite a bit of time to get to the room or anywhere else within the space. We were hoping to spend a lot of time in the study space (a gorgeous public workspace)-- but the hotel made us move as they had booked it for a private event. With spaces so limited in this hotel, renting one of the few public spaces is just not cool. Again, these were beautifully designed--and cozy.There is a great little coffee bar in the lobby, and the second floor bar is great. We got to the roof which was great and found space to perch.

They are very professional, snappy, smart looking people! They always have a smile on their sweet faces! They even give me full information about the hotel and was even asked how my day was going! They offer help to get me a cab while waiting at the lobby. Their public attendant was even trained so well to open a discussion and leave a very sweet remark to start your day.Rooms - very clean, enough for business travelers, and provide you everything you need! The must see is their Rooftop! Really breathtaking. Awesome is the right word!

We arrived and the reception is a cool/funky area and we were greeted by Miguel who checked us in. Initially when we got to our first room on the tenth floor, we were very disappointed with the view, as this hotel is known for its fantastic views! We had a view of a fire escape and the room was very dark. With the rooms being micro rooms (which are absolutely fantastic) we felt we had to change rooms as there was no real natural light going into the room and made it feel quite claustrophobic. We went back down to reception, explained why we were not happy with the room, and Miguel (Who is an absolute credit to your hotel, such a great guy!) and another helpful lady in reception helped us upgrade to the 29th floor with a view that took our breath away! Loved waking up, pressing the shutter up button and waking up next to one of the most famous buildings in the world! The beds are really comfy and the whole micro room concept works great, room didn’t feel cramped and although the bathrooms don’t allow for to much privacy (if you don’t know who you’re staying with well by the time you arrive you certainly will by the time you leave) they are of a great size and well decorated! Once we had unpacked in our room and had some complimentary cocktails we headed up to the roof top terrace, this is absolutely awesome! Fantastic view of the Empire State Building and of the New York skyline! Shame the bar was closed as it was out of season but being able to take some fantastic photos from the terrace was great! Also the glass floor it’s really cool and adds some humour watching people trying to be brave enough to stand on it! I loved it but a few peoples knees went wobbly whenever they went near it! Reason for our trip was it was my 30th birthday, and something I thought was a really nice touch was the complimentary wine and Macaroons that greeted us once we returned from our exploring one evening. Such a nice personal touch that will live long in my memory! If I had to pick something that could be improved slightly is the breakfast from the adjacent restaurant, we had it one morning and whilst the buffet was tasty, there wasn’t to much choice but it’s hardly a bad thing as the location of the hotel means there’s loads of great breakfast places literally round the corner! The lifts can also take ages, but with it being a compact hotel and being on the 29th floor it’s to be expected really! Not a moan at all but sometimes we called the lift and were waiting 5 minutes or so for it to arrive. All the hotel cleaners/maintenance people you bump knot always say hello too! This was my first time to New York and I plan to come again later in the year and I shall absolutely make sure I book this hotel again, and have also recommended it to a number of my friends who are looking at a mini break in the big apple!

We got to our room 1107 which was like a cupboard, but there was good use of the little space there was. The ""view"" from the room was disappointing - a back alley and little else. We had asked BA about paying for an upgraded room - like the one advertised everywhere with the full length windows and amazing views - and were told we would have to do it through the hotel on arrival but when we asked at the hotel there were no free rooms.The ""bathroom"" leaves little to the imagination with just a sliding door (with a big gap) separating the toilet and shower from the room - may be a problem if you aren't totally comfortable around the person you're staying with. I didn't use the shampoo, conditioner or shower gel provided but it did smell nice and its a nice touch to have these provided.The room also has a steamer (which we didn't use), a hairdryer (which is unusually powerful for a hotel hairdryer) and an in room safe.The bed was very comfortable but the air-con / heating system was too loud through the night. We turned it off and slept with the window open - the noise of the city was easier to sleep through than the fan!The lift in the hotel - while fast when you were in it - took AGES to arrive! A couple of times we waited so long we gave up and used the stairs. Not a problem when your on floor 11 but would be an issue on higher floors.The location of the hotel is great - East 31st street. It is a couple of minutes walk from the Empire State Building and Macy's and in easy walking proximity to most other places - only took 25 minutes to walk to Tiffany & Co which is right next to central park and to get there is further than Grand Central, Times Square and other tourist spots.On our last night we asked reception to book us a taxi for 04.15am to JFK airport and were told it would be there for us.

I must say I was not disappointed. From the moment I walked in the staff were friendly and helpful. On arrival I had realised that I had left my power adaptor at home. They happily let me borrow one of theirs for my stay which i was ever grateful for. I was staying in a King Sky Room. When I got to my room the first thing that hit me was the view. I wasn't looking at the Empire State Building or anything iconic but the view of the city was incredible and it only got better at night. It was a shame to put the blinds down as you just wanted to look at the view forever. The view got a lot better too when we were in a snow storm. The shower was very good as well at the rest of the bathroom. The hanging space was not very large and only realised a couple of days in but there was a cupboard above this area which was quite large. The bed was huge and very comfortable even with my big suitcases jammed underneath it. The rooms are small yes, but if you keep things organised then its not a problem at all. The safe under the bed was very helpful. My only criticism of the room was the refrigerator which didn't cool anything down. I raised this whilst I was there and was told an engineer would look at it. Later they told me that the engineer looked and it was fine. So really its not a refrigerator just a cool box, if what you're putting in isn't already cold, its not going to get any colder. Apart from that I have no complaints, I have seen some people complain about the elevators, but i saw no problem here. I would 100% stay here again, I am even looking at when I can next visit the city and will be looking to stay here again when I do.","Flintshire, United Kingdom","Pjones86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Flintshire, United Kingdom</strong>",11,5.0

On my second night there, I had been out with friends for dinner and came back to the hotel and couldn't get into my room. I went down to the front desk, got a new key. Didn't work.

So I spent most of the night with two men in a corridor trying to get into my room. I can't remember how long I was there (several hours), but the options I was given were wait at the door or in the lobby. I was given a room to freshen up in but that was only after asked as I had to meet people in a couple of hours.

My last stay was this year in January as a treat for my fathers Christmas present, so we booked two rooms.Check-in was a little chaotic, we were stood some time with little help, but finally somebody gave us their attention. There was minimal welcoming and in fact minimal conversation bar that of asking for the essentials. Not a very warm welcome at all.We finally reached our rooms only to find both on lower floors with a view of brick wall / internal yard, where the noise levels were beyond awful due to the all of the air con units being in the same yard. More so, we had been promised rooms near each other and with a view. Needless to say that wasn't the case. These things happen and we went back to ask what had happened.We got passed pillar to post and got told to live out of our suitcases for one night, come back in the morning and things would be sorted. Not suprisingly, we did this, only to be told it couldn't be sorted at that time and to come back that evening. We also did this. We were passed between '3' managers who just passed us off and due to shift changes, gave it to somebody else to deal with only for us to have to explain all of the story again, and the promises of the previous manager (although i'm not sure they believed us..). Finally that evening, we were told it would be sorted (again) but we would have to come back in the morning so basically wasn't worth us unpacking again. So for 2 out of our 5 nights we were case bound. Not great service and no real apology.To top it off, in both sets of rooms (we had 4 in total..) the level of maintenance was shocking. The nice touches that were always unique were gone. The multiple clocks that were on the wall for instance had all been stolen / removed, wall mounted swing out lamps were literally falling off the walls, one room had faulty air conditioning and the general cleanliness was not that of previous stays.From being my favorite hotel, I would not return based on this experience alone.

The hotel is described as a micro hotel, meaning that the rooms are efficiently sized and functional. Our room contained a modern and decently sized toilet/shower combination that is separated from the main area by a frosted glass partition. The sink is located in the main living area, which is designed to be optimally functional. Beds are comfortable and unless one brings many large suitcases, there is enough space to deal with one’s belongings. In many ways, the rooms in the Arlo Nomad are bigger than most hotel rooms that one encounters when visiting Japan. If it works in Japan, then why not in NYC? The only potential concern is that there is less privacy in the bathroom area than in a standard hotel room – for couples this should not be an issue, but for friends sharing a room, this may be something to work around. Perhaps, the rooms are not the most spacious to hang out in for extended periods of time, but hey, this is New York, and one should spend one’s time exploring the city rather than hanging out in a hotel.

Great hotel, found it hard not to give it five stars, but just a few things stopped me, but lets start with the positives. Location, location, location. If you want to go somewhere with a great location then this hotel is amazing. Close to Empire State, Flat Iron and Times Square (which are a short walk away) but for us having been to NYC a few times, it was the proximity to so many roof top bars that we loved! Shame their own Heights rooftop bar was not open but you can still go up and get some great pictures. But if you want some good recommendations then go to Skylark, Refinery, Spyglass, 230 5th (amazing heated pods) & Mr.Purple (though busy at weekends!). Back to the hotel, rooms are small, no getting past that, if an issue then don't book, but if you want a good place just to sleep, wash and (cough), then it's perfect. Let's be honest that's all you should need a hotel for! Shower is amazing, rooms are clean with a really comfy bed and views are great past the 15th floor so make sure you book a room high up! Staff are friendly and really helpful, food is good in bar area but could do with a few more places to sit. The only real negatives are the size of the rooms. If you are tall then don't book, trying to get ready in a room this small was a challenge for us (both under 5.8). It would have also been nice to have had some tea and coffee making facilities in room. You can go down to lobby area to get drinks but just always nice to wake up to a drink. A good tip for the hotel would be a room drink delivery service! Would definitely go back to this hotel as the location is great, comfortable and perfect for what we needed.

I was on the 18th floor and expected this to be a quiet room but the noise from outside permeated the double glazing. I found that surprising as my experience with double glazed windows is that it blocks out most noise but I could clearly hear the sounds from the building site across the road as well as the odd ambulance or police car sirens. The air conditioning fan switches on and off quite noisily too. Once you get used to the various noises, it isn’t too bad but me being a light sleeper, took a couple of days. As a single traveler, it was fine but I thought that two people staying in the room would be on top of each other - only one chair, for instance, and very little space to move around. Not much room for a regular sized suitcase so many be a problem if you have lots of luggage.","London, United Kingdom","andiedan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",19,4.0

No faults with the bathroom.the door is frosted but we had no issues but maybe staying with a friend it could get awkard so make sure your comfortable with that person. Had breakfast one time in the hotel and it was okay, maybe more of a selection would be good for the cost of 20 dollars each...The location is fab and can't be faulted. We walked everywhere but taxis and Ubers are always close by. The only fault was the payment. We got told when we had booked that a charge of 75 dollars would come from our account and held until we left.... in actual fact the whole payment was taken when we were checking in. We explained having a Irish Bank account that pending payments still get taken from our bank straight away but they insisted they needed to take the full funds before we could check in.

You'd think this would be a problem, but it really wasn't. We stayed a week, and at no point did I feel like I needed more space. As a matter of fact, it felt like we moved in. Closet was big enough to hold our clothing --and even the stuff that got wrinkled on the way in, we were able to smooth out with the steamer they provide in the room. The bed was fantastic (there were two of us), the bathroom was big enough, the toiletries smelled wonderful, and there was wifi. Basically, everything you need is at hand. The spaces provided by the hotel were also just perfect. I had to work while in NY, and sitting down at their 2nd floor library thing was a lot like being in a fancy library.

The room was obviously small but as expected, like many people have said. You are in New York for exploring and not sitting in your room. We found the room to be a comfortable size for two persons with two large suitcases. The room has great facilities and what you need for the four nights we were there. It was very clean to a high standard. We were first put into room 608 but we found after a couple of days that the room was rather noisy due to a fan near by and we struggled to get a good night sleep. We went to reception to see if we could get a higher room or a room which was quieter, they sorted out a higher room for us. We were given an upgrade free of charge to room 2907 which had the most amazing view of the Empire State Building. It is so beautiful at night time with its lights on. We are so grateful to the staff who made our trip even more special.The location of the hotel is great. It is around a 10-15 minute walk into the heart of Times Square. Which is great because your not in the crowded area but close enough to a number of attractions and subways. We always felt safe at night but as many people say you need to be street smart. I.E I found in Times Square a number of people trying to sell CD’s. I have read on reviews before that this is a scam as they give you a blank CD and demand payment. We had a number of them come up with some strange comments or mimic your accent , I believe to make you stop and talk. Just ignore them or tell them no thanks.Overall, this is a fantastic hotel in the most amazing city.

Yes the rooms are small, but not that it was advertised otherwise. Was only here for one night and didn't have an issue until I stored my duffel bag at the counter for a couple hours, and came back to see it torn on one side. Seems like a hook for shoulder straps was hooked on to something and ripped it.It's a new bag and the tear definitely wasn't there before, but I know mistakes happen and it wasn't an extremely sturdy bag anyways. I just notified the employee at the front desk to say this happened and wasn't expecting anything in return. However, the front desk was extremely apologetic about it, and a manager gave me her name card telling me that if I can send her the receipt for the bag, they'll reimburse me. It was a decent surprise. I checked out and lived at my friends place for two days. I asked my sister who bought me the bag if she has the receipt, she said no but it's only around $40. So I was just so around NoMad that day and was looking for somewhere to put my bag, and figured that since I don't have the receipt for the bag, ask if Arlo to forget about the reimbursement in exchange for storing my bag for free for a while. When I explained the situation to the front desk, not only did they offered to store my bag for free, they reimbursed me $40 for the bag as well. I was definitely not expecting it, and definitely really appreciated it.A couple days later I was going through my credit card transactions to see if the refund was posted so I can write a 5 star review on the hotel (and I rarely write reviews). However, although I do see a $40 refund, I saw an additional charges from Arlo that is $21.2. I was strange as I don't recall buying anything from the hotel or taking anything from the room. I sent a message to Arlo through booking.com asking about it, and got a apologetic reply several hours later telling me that they will be posted in 3-5 business days. I got my refund a couple days later.Although there are some issues along the way so I can't justify giving it a 5 star, I still quite like the hotel. Hope the staff can improve attention to detail more in the future.","Cambridge, Massachusetts","Nicol L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>",0,4.0

We booked a great deal with BA for a flight and hotel package. Our room was on the 26th floor (can’t remember the room number - maybe 2609?)We arrived at the hotel around 12pm and was warmly greeted by Carly (huge shoutout to Carly as she helped with every single issue we had - none to do with the hotel). Our room was ready but we decided we wanted to upgrade as we were slightly nervous of space (especially with the shopping we planned to do) and also we wanted a better view. So we booked a queen with view. It was an extra $10 per night so our total came to $40 which was deducted from our $75 deposit at the end of our stay. I understand Arlo NoMad being a micro hotel theme, but considering this, our room had a decent amount of space which held 2 large suitcases and 2 cabin luggage and about 40 bags of shopping (no exaggeration). The bed was comfortable and the pillows were lovely. After a long chilly day of shopping and marching up and downtown, we really looked forward to going back to a clean room and getting into bed. Slept like a log despite still being on London time (11pm nights, 4/5am mornings). Rooms serviced daily and smelled lovely. Bathroom is modern and a great size. Towels (replaced every day) and toiletries provided (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, soaps, hand/body cream).Decor of the hotel is super cute! It’s modern with a slight rustic feel. We didn’t get the opportunity to try the Massoni restaurant as we were strapped for time and already planned where we wanted to eat. Loads of places around the hotel to just sit and chill. WiFi is free and very good (I managed to have clear WhatsApp & FaceTime video calls every night to the UK). The hotel is centrally located in Manhattan - Macy’s is literally a 5 minute walk and Times Square about 7 minutes. So this hotel is ideal for location and short stays. Slight con:Bathroom... I appreciate the design of the room and aesthetically, how great it looks, but using the bathroom was a slightly awkward for us - even as two close female cousins. The doors are glass (no lock), the glass is slightly blurred (but you can still make out what the person is doing) and there is a gap at the top between the door and ceiling so sounds and smells could easily invade the room and reduces privacy - for the person using the bathroom and the person in the room! (Arlo do something about this! Either have a supersonic air-con system in the bathrooms or provide really good toilet sprays!). We made sure our TV was cranked up and made use of the Bluetooth speaker provided in the rooms. This obviously didn’t devastate our stay, but did send my cousin and myself into fits of giggles when thinking about the toilet situation. Tip: probably best to go to the local CVS Pharmacy 3 minutes away and purchase a toilet spray like we did. Apart from that, love this hotel.Views - 100% accurate as you see in the pictures on Trip Advisor and on the website. Amazing to wake up to sky scraper buildings & the Empire State every morning.  I would 100% recommend this hotel to adults on romantic trips or girly getaways (make sure you are 100% comfortable getting up close and personal with the person you are sharing a room with). Staff are extremely friendly which is such a credit to Arlo NoMad. Consider paying for a room with a view as it it’s really worth waking up to every morning during your stay.

The bathroom, for instance, is basically part of the room, with no real door, and we missed some of the amenities that you usually expect to find in an American hotel, such as for instance a kettle with instant coffee and tea.

To our surprise, we were notified our room was ready fairly quickly and upon return found our luggage was already in our room (less hassle and a kind gesture in my book). We booked via a third-party website and booked one of their corner view rooms. We were skeptical at first and afraid we wouldn’t get the room we wanted, but boy was I wrong. Corner room views have floor-to-ceiling windows on two walls, giving you a perfect view of the city. Our view – the Empire State Building! The hotel is in the heart of Midtown and the surrounding area calls for food, coffee, and shopping galore! For a New York City hotel, the rooms were fairly sized. Toiletries were provided and the room is equipped with a mini fridge. Oh yes, and the bed is very cozy and warm, especially during a cold January weekend. The second floor of the hotel hosts the BARlo, which is a small bar with minimal, but cozy seating. We visited the BARlo on our last night and regret we hadn’t any sooner, as the drinks and food were phenomenal. Not to mention the bartender was very nice! We had a small pepperoni pizza, deep-dish style and perfect for two to snack on. If you’re starving, I’d recommend ordering one for each! On departure date, we left our luggage downstairs to avoid checking out post the check-out time, and just like during check-in, our luggage was handled meticulously while we explored the city some more.

Twice at this particular one. I like it because of its great location and design. The hotel is young, hip and cool. However if you go with friends, the only room option is bunk beds (double rooms are way smaller). We didnt care, and thought it would be fun. However depending on the floor and floor plans, bunk rooms can go from tini tiny (not kidding, you have to find a way to put luggage away or you wont fit), to decent sized. Last time we got the decent sized room. This time I called in advance to ask for it, and from my 3 rooms reservation they gave it to 2 of the rooms, but not to mine.

You are out of hustle and bustle of Broadway but can be in it in minutes. Subway (NYC's tube) and bus stops are all within a couple of minutes walk.The front of the hotel is large glass fronted and looks really nice, but at the time of our visit it had scaffolding surrounding it from work being done on buildings either side of it and bags of rubbish on the street (not that thats unusual for NYC!!) which slightly spoils your first impressions.The lobby is small with a restaurant, Massoni, at the back and a small food counter/cafe which is open 24hrs a day called Bodega to the side.The reception staff are pleasant and helpful and greet you with a smile.Not sure how many rooms this hotel has but some have a city view some are street view. We had a city view room that had a full view of the Empire State Building (all lit up for New Year).They are all generally small rooms and I mean small. There is limited wardrobe space. On our stay (4 nights) we mainly lived out of our suitcases which we had to keep under the bed (my wife got all the available hanging spaces!!).The beds are firm and comfortable ...the pillows are not!!!The shower (we had a tiny bath as part of it) was clean and efficient and they supply shampoo, conditioner and soap (saves packing any!).There is a TV (in weird places), safe and lots of plugs and usb charging stations.Not much more to add about the rooms.Lifts to the rooms operate well and are fast.The hotel in general.The hotel offers loads of events, check their web site for details.It has a second floor bar and serves bar snacks and a library and a rooftop bar which is not generally open during the winter but you can go up there for excellent views of NYC.The Bodega Cafe bar in the foyer serves hot and cold food and coffee but we only bought coffee as the food didn't look that appealing and there wasn't much choice. It is also chaotic and makes the foyer look untidy..... suggest they need to spend some effort on this to bring it up to standard. The restaurant, Massoni, is run by a separate business and is located at the back of the foyer. It has a small but well stocked bar leading in to a modern Italian restaurant that is smartly decorated with just the right level of lighting to prevent you squinting to see your food. I cannot comment on the general level of the food the restaurant as we only ate in there for a special New Years Eve dinner which was specific to that event and to be honest, whilst, the food was good it was spoilt by shabby chaotic service (they were full and in fact had to use the bar area as an over flow).Check in at the hotel is easy as is check out. They pre take your money to settle the bill so unless you have any issues you don't have to do much. They have a secure area to store your luggage should you have a late departure.Generally, our stay at the Arlo Nomad was ok and to some extent was spoilt by the New Years Eve event which wasn't that well executed but I don't really won't to go in to too much detail about that as it shouldn't cloud your decision to stay at the hotel.We loved the location and the staff and if you don't mind the lack of bedroom space (and rubbish pillows) this is a nice hotel and is in the mid price + range for a NYC hotel","Selby, United Kingdom","jotalemm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Selby, United Kingdom</strong>",11,3.0

Not that I'm a stickler on electronics, but the alarm clock and phone were both unplugged when we arrived.The bed is comfy but the AC is so loud that you'll have to turn it off if you want any shuteye. The staff is hit or miss. The check-in desk staff was always friendly, as were the bar/restaurant staff. But the room cleaners were oddly aggressive about cleaning the room. We were asked at 830 (??!?!) if they could service the room (in fairness it looked like we were leaving, but we were simply running downstairs for coffee). I was then asked at 9 when they could service the room. When I suggested 10, I got a very confused/disappointed look which I couldn't really understand, considering the time. Overall, great idea, but there are better places to stay at this price point, even in Manhattan. Pros: Location; nice restaurant/bar if you need a launch point for midtown/East Village shenanigans; I assume the rooftop bar would be great in summer.Cons: Room size; Air con is too loud to be useful; Hit or miss staff; room size...","London, United Kingdom","Christian P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",19,3.0

The location is good if you want to be near Macy's and Time Square, Empire State Building etc. I would give it a 5 if it were possible to fix this....The reason for my 4 rating is because the bathroom has a frosted sliding door but there is a bit of a space between the door and the wall, like a gap. As a result of the gap, you can kind of be seen sitting on the toilet. I didn't mind the frosted door, but even if the hotel could put the sliding door on the inside, then there wouldn't be the gap. One more thing - the HVAC is loud but it didn't bother me. Ultimately, I would absolutely stay here again. I LOVED the hotel! I added a photo so that everyone could understand. It's the biggest part of the room and my bf on the bed is 6 feet tall. ",,Shawna P,21,4.0

I might even go back. Casual vibe, but thankfully without the ""hipper than thou"" attitude of so many similar properties. The staff appears to understand that they are working in a hotel. A place people come to sleep. That gets to my one real issue - albeit a fairly serious one. The HVAC fan was incredibly loud. Every time it cycled on it sounded like a plane taking off. I literally could not hear a conversation on my phone. I asked them to look at it before I went out to dinner, but apparently there was no fix, so I ended up just turning the system off and burrowing under the covers for the night. The good news is that it wasn't all that cold out! The manager did the right thing at checkout so I left with a good feeling about the place, but still would be a bit wary about a return visit as I don't know if this is a general or room specific issue. As to the room - it was truly tiny, but comfortable nonetheless once I moved a chair to use as a bedside table and a stool to put my bag on. Fine for one person, one night - any more of either would have been uncomfortable. With the floor to ceiling windows literally surrounding the bed, it had a bit of fish bowl meets treehouse feel - I liked it, but be aware if you prefer a dark, heavily curtained sleeping environment. This is not that. The bed/linens were good, as was the bath. The showe curtain set up was odd - you have to unhook and rehook to use and it didn't fit properly, but the shower itself was fine. All in all, if you need to be in that part of the city it is a friendly, good value option - HVAC issue aside.","Chatham, New Jersey","MBKNJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chatham, New Jersey</strong>",70,4.0

Even though it was small, the space was efficiently organized with drawers, hooks, and little shelves to place things out of the way. We were on the fifth floor and the view was not so good. Again, I wasn't expecting it to be good considering we were on a lower floor. We looked out on other buildings and the fire escape. Plus I only booked this hotel a week in advance and was looking at getting a good hotel not at an exorbitant price. I missed having a coffee maker in the room but there is a bodega in the lobby that served yummy coffee and other goodies (both sweet and savory) that is open 24 hours. My only serious complaint about our room was that one had to crawl over the bed to get to the rest of the room. There is about a foot wide walking area at the foot of the bed that could be used but it's narrow and one has to maneuver around the TV on the wall. The rooftop area is awesome with a bar and great views of the city. It's spacious as well.

I love my rooms with a good view, I am actually obsessed - the only thing I need in my room is the best view and that is really what I pay for. We paid premium for the Queen Sky room and I would recommend everyone to upgrade if you can afford it. I loved the look and feel of this boutique hotel in Midtown, close to practically everything. However, I booked through Hotels.com (I am collecting reward nights), and even sent the hotel an email after requesting the highest level room possible facing the Empire State since it was also our anniversary celebration. I liked our room, but it could have been better - from the 23rd floor, I had to really angle myself to see the empire state AND we had an old brick building facing the bed (the first thing you see when you wake up). The left side of the room was great, but we weren't facing it. I have a feeling that had I booked directly with the hotel, I would have ended up with a better deal, views and even treats for celebrations like most other people with the Sky room have mentioned. It wasn't terrible, but I was hoping for a lot more. Yes the rooms are tiny, but super clean and well designed and who cares when your views are so great. We coughed up a lot of $$ for this and I was a tad bit disappointed that nobody checked on us or that our request wasn't considered really. While I see photos of many other guests receiving rooms of their choice and treats for the special event, ours was over looked. The hotel does try I guess, but we weren't as lucky.

I contacted the hotel beforehand to ask them if they could put some balloons in his room and maybe a banner, for when we arrived; they said they would and they forgot! Luckily I had taken some things with me and asked them to do it for the next day. They did attempt at making it up to him by leaving some cheap plonk.When we arrived in our rooms, we knew that the rooms would be small, but not so small that there weren't any drawers for clothes and hanging space for a few items above the fridge. There was absolutely nothing in the fridge either, not even bottles of water upon our arrival. I was also travelling for business in addition to a 5 day holiday, so I had a large suitcase with me and so did my husband, neither would fit under the bed, or anywhere else and as I couldn't store my clothes anywhere, the case had to be kept at the back of the door in front of the full length mirror. This was not only inconvenient, but a safety hazard, as the bathroom area was all glass and if you tripped over the case you could have fallen into the glass and any escape in the event of fire or other emergency would have been hampered. The hotel blamed BA and BA blamed the hotel when I complained. The hotel didn't really offer an acceptable solution to our problem. The Manageress who we saw was useless and emitted an air of authority rather than reason and solution.The hotel is also pretty lifeless despite having a roof top bar and cocktail bar. The service is pretty naff too........I mean who serves cans of warm beer to guests???? The cocktails weren't brilliant either.The reception staff could do with lessons in smiling too and the staff in the lobby take away were downright rude. In fact, we decided not to bother eating in the hotel restaurant as we were so disappointed with the bars and service.The lifts were terrible! You were squashed into a small area to queue for the lifts and often once inside you were up and down before arriving at your chosen floor.There was also a strange smell in the lobby that was quite nauseating and on an evening there were piles of rubbish outside the main entrance.There were some positives:The location of the hotel is great and the beds were pretty comfortable, oh and the views of Manhattan and the Empire State were decent too.If you are going to New York for more than a couple of days forget this place, there are many more hip and trendy hotels that provide a better experience for the money.

The blinds were difficult to move up and down (and I did need them, the floor to ceiling windows make it very sunny during the day!). Comfy bed, nice linens, nice toiletries (although in dispensers in the shower). We were going to celebrate my partner's 30th birthday - I informed the hotel of this prior but there was no acknowledgement (certainly not necessary but would have been nice for him!

From the moment you walk in you are greeted by a wonderfully scented lobby and friendly staff. The lobby and surrounding areas (seating areas, restaurant etc) are beautifully decorated. It is a fairly new hotel as I understand and that does reflect in the appearance. The rooms: My experience is of the Queen Sky rooms. They are small, yes, but perfectly formed. The linen on the bed is crisp and white, everything is clean and does not have that old or worn feeing of some older hotels. Floor to ceiling windows, tip: don’t forget to pull the curtain across when dressing or after showering, there are often workmen working high up on neighbouring buildings that - from experience *blush* can definitely see in. There is a hairdryer and clothes steamer, shower products and towels. The bathroom is clean and functional, nice rain shower. Note: the bathroom is ‘right there’ in the room, with just a frosted panel to divide, so does not give much privacy with regards to whatever is going on in there (sound or scent wise). I opted to book two rooms for my stay with my older teen daughter and glad I did given the layout. The elevators do get busy with the top floor bar guests, however this was more of a problem going down that coming up I found, so if you have dinner plans just budget an extra 5-10 minutes to get downstairs in case the elevators are full. A handwritten birthday note, chocolate for my daughter and wine for me was a thoughtful touch in the rooms. Finally, I absolutely would have given a 5 stars review has it not been for the initial disappointment upon arrival. I chose this hotel after a lot of research for the incredible views I had seen from photos of the sky rooms. But what do you have to do to get a high floor? I spent over $1400 on two sky rooms, booked well in advance, booked through the hotel directly via their own website, and emailed two months in advance to request a high a floor as possible, explaining it was a birthday treat for my daughter - yet all of that still equated upon arrival to being placed on the *lowest possible floor for our room type*. I expressed my disappointment and asked if there would be a possibility of moving for the next night, I was told no. After 12+ hours of travelling I was pretty disappointed. Then when we went up I discovered that in my sky corner room, one corner just faced a brick wall. I felt I should have just booked a regular room and not paid the extra for a corner room when one corner did not have a view. After going downstairs and again expressing my disappointment, it was arranged that we could change rooms for the second night to floors 25 and 27. Whilst I was very grateful to be swapped to the higher floors, it meant having to pack all of our cases up in the morning ready to be moved to the new rooms, then unpack again that evening. Would I stay again? Yes, it’s a beautiful hotel. Would I book the expensive rooms again? No, probably not. I feel they should consider tiering and dividing the rooms, so when booking you have more control over your view eg. ‘empire view sky room’ or ‘city view sky room’ or ‘lower sky floors 20-25’ and ‘upper sky floors 26 - 29’.

We booked the hotel months ago after doing fairly extensive research on a great place to stay in NYC. The location is great - it's not too touristy and is situated in an area with multiple excellent places to eat and drink all within a 5 minute walk!The selling point of the hotel are the views from the room. We booked for a Queen Sky Room and the website (obviously taken from the highest room possible) shows some absolutely spectacular views. I had seen mixed reviews on here saying the lower floor rooms do not have the best views so ahead of time I emailed the hotel saying could we please have the highest room available. Now, assuming not everyone does this (maybe they do!) we were placed on the 22nd floor in room 2206 (the rooms go up to floor 29 and i believe these rooms start on the 21st floor) which i don't think was particularly high - whilst the view was ""ok"" it was nothing spectacular like expecting, Sitting in the bed you couldnt see very much - it was only stood off the bed leaning against the wall you could see the view - a bit of an anticlimax to be honest! I think it may be because we were on the opposite corner to the views on the website? I also wonder if this is because i booked through hotels.com (I always do this as a rule) and not directly but the rates were the same price at the time of booking so it made sense to do it that way.I knew the room was going to be small (once youve stayed in hotels in Japan you can cope with any size!) but these rooms don't have much room to store either so please be aware of that when booking! I made it work and this is a hotel to come for one or two nights - not really any longer!My main bug bears were the towels in the room - my husband and i are normal sized; we need towels that can at least cover our bodies! I called housekeeping to bring up two more LARGE towels and instead we were greeted with two full sets of towels. So now we had FOUR sets of towels (all of which are so small) with no where to store them - please consider getting bath sheets for your guests - the ""large"" towels you provide are just too small!Secondly, the room was very dusty and having the air con on (we stayed in 30 degree heat) meant that this dust was circulating and my husband contracted a cough so severe he pulled muscles in his chest from coughing so much - not really great for a holiday! Not only this but the air con units are SO LOUD that we were both woken up regularly throughout the night.The staff are very helpful and very polite and friendly so this was never an issue.The bar on the top floor is also very cool with excellent views and a glass floor for those who aren't terrified of heights!The comments about the lift never really affected us but on occasion we did have to wait a while (thanks for the X and O's on the wall) but never long enough to get frustrated!Perhaps my expectations of this hotel were too high and although it was a pleasant stay, i woudn't return. I've given it 4 stars not 3 because i do genuinely think 3 is too low but i also wouldn't call it ""very good""!","London, United Kingdom","152katies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",60,4.0

We had gotten a Queen Urban room on the 9th floor overlooking E 31st St which offered a beautiful view of the ""golden"" tower capping the New York Life Insurance Building off in the distance at Park Avenue. When it is lit up at night, the golden emanation is sight to behold especially from the comfort of one's room. Although the type of room we booked was small it is not inconveniently so by NYC standards. Besides, the linen in our room was clean and fresh. The Bodega in the lobby offered a rich coffee perfect for a morning pick me up as well as tasty pies and creative appetizers such as marinated whole onions, squash caponata and mushroom pie. Then, there is the Massoni where some of the entrées have an Italian-Asian fusion touch and it was a treat for us as we dined there while sipping some delicious Rosé. Lastly, there is a rooftop bar called The Heights. Perched above the 31st floor level it offers a superb panorama of New York City with a closeup view of the Empire State Building which is awesome at sunset when the building is lit up. We went up to the rooftop bar on a Friday evening and it was full of people enjoying themselves. In the mornings yoga classes are conducted on the rooftop giving one an option to join in. There is also a lounge on the 2nd floor which has a bar and opens out into a study where one can sit and enjoy the ambience conveyed by books and maps. The location (roughly a 15-minute walk from Penn Station), the friendliness, the food and the clean rooms are some of the great plus points of this hotel. Also noteworthy are that cabs frequently pass down the street (31st) and are easily hailed. Although one would have expected noise due to a younger clientele when we were there, in truth, we did not experience any unreasonable amount of noise on the 9th floor. Likewise, although the beeps from ascending and descending elevators could be heard at night from our particular room it did not rise to the level of becoming an issue. One more point is that calling up the elevators requires the use of a keycard and selecting options from a menu on the wall which takes a little practice but once mastered it is quite gratifying.

Minutes from the Empire State Building, and a short walk to Penn Station, you couldn't ask for more. I normally go for budget hotels, but if you're looking for a NYC splurge (within reason) then this seems a really good choice.As other reviews mention, the immaculate rooms (with great showers) can be small (mine was), but:a) They're no smaller than you'd get in, say, Hong Kongb) It's New York! After 10 minutes admiring the view, who wants to stay in their bedroom?The rooftop bar gives you a perfect King Kong view of the Empire State Building. As others discuss, it will likely be full of black-clad Manhatten Millennials on Friday and Saturday nights, but when I popped up later on a Sunday night is was empty.It's also worth mentioning the work spaces - the second floor has a big area with tables and power sockets open 24/7, which I found really useful as I was mixing business with the sightseeing. They offer you bikes and also have a nice little 'top tips for NYC' board at the bottom of the elevators, where fellow travellers share their finds.

We each booked separate rooms in the Arlo Nomad. Looking at the pictures on tripadvisor and elsewhere, I decided to upgrade to one of those corner rooms with floor-to-ceiling glass windows.After getting to the hotel, smelling the nice scent of the lobby area, and checking in, I was given the key and eagerly took the elevator to the room. I didn't get one of the higher-level rooms (I forget which floors the views start) due to them being booked up during the time I was there. I think I was on the 14th floor and there was no view. Well, there was a view - directly into the windows of the surrounding office buildings. My friend who did not pay for the corner room upgrade had a regular Queen-sized room on a lower-floor and she had much better views than I did. Oh well, at least I had cool floor-to-ceiling windows.My room was extraordinarily tiny. I didn't have a desk or even a nightstand to put my phone while I slept. I ended up taking a foot stool from under the bathroom sink and used that as a nightstand - however, this blocked the door to the room, so I had to move it back to the bathroom during the daytime so I could enter/exit the room. I didn't really have a place to put my roll-aboard suitcase, so I just put it on the floor next to the bathroom. The thing is - the huge bed takes up 2/3 or more of the entire room. Next time, I'll get a room with a smaller bed.Additionally, I had various problems with my room: I couldn't get the black-out curtains to rise after closing them my first night, the shower curtain needed repaired (the hook it connects to fell off the wall), and I had electrical problems with the lighting. Not major issues - and the hotel maintenance crew fixed them all immediately. The level of attention in this regard was impressive.Besides the room, the hotel was very cool. The top-floor outdoor bar was always a fun time. My friend and I are in our mid-late 40s - so we felt a little out-of-place with the young NYC crowd on the roof. People really get dressed up in NYC - even to go out on a rooftop bar in the July heat! Being from Seattle, I was impressed with how people get so dressed up in NYC even in the summertime. I'm also a beer drinker and the beer-selections on the top floor bar were limited - though cocktails and spirits were flowing. Still, the views from up there were just absolutely amazing.The breakfast lounge/restaurant on the ground floor was excellent. We had breakfast there twice and loved it each time. Even the design of the restaurant was beautiful.Of course, the location is great, too. It's close to both Midtown and south of Midtown neighborhoods. Though, due to the heat, we often took Uber since the nearby subways were more-or-less under construction/delayed.Would I stay here again? Perhaps - depending on the price. I definitely wouldn't get a floor-to-ceiling windows room unless I could get one in the upper levels and I'd bring a large backpack or duffel bag instead of a roll aboard to save space in the room. Give it a try - I bet most people visiting NYC will really like this hotel.","Seattle, Washington","Brian_SEA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",23,4.0

Firstly, the decor is stunning, stylish, and minimalistic. The room was extremely clean and well thought out in regards to design, utilizing all the space in an effective manner. Upon check in, we were greeted with friendly staff, who gave us an upgrade, we had paid to stay in a lower level room, and were upgraded to the 17th floor, giving us an amazing view. We are very grateful for this and something we didn't expect from the hotel. Housekeeping was fantastic, providing us with fresh clean towels everyday, and every evening we came back to the room we were greeted with a clean and tidy space. The rooftop bar is an amazing addition; although drinks up there are pricey, but this is more than made up for with the view you get at the top. Location wise it can't be faulted, it's only a few blocks away from Grand Central Station; as well as being on the corner of Fifth Avenue, so you're not far away from the shops and sights. The only downfall to this hotel is the lifts. You end up waiting about 5 minutes for your lift to arrive at your floor, and there isn't a separate lift for staff and visitors to the bars.

I was upgraded from a ""bunk room"" to a Queen Bed corner room. The room itself is small but cool, the bed seems to float in the corner of floor to ceiling windows. The bed was very comfortable, no complaints there. There were only two aspects of the room that I didn't like. First off, there is no desk in the room. They have a common area on the second floor where you can work, but I prefer to work in my room, and that was not an option here. Secondly, the air conditioner is abnormally loud, I had the fan on low but it was still strangely loud. Fortunately, it did not prevent me from sleeping really well but for light sleepers it could be an issue. As with most hotels in New York there is also no coffee maker in the room. If I were vacationing in the city, I'd gladly give the hotel a Five Star rating but for business it's just a Four.","Knoxville, Tennessee","travelinfilmmaker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Knoxville, Tennessee</strong>",11,4.0

The soundproofing int the rooms is also spot on. We didn't hear a peep from our various neighbours throughout the course of the week.At the point of making my reservation I informed the Front of House Manager that we were visiting New York for the first time and I was proposing to my Girlfriend on the first day. When we arrived at the hotel to check in we were put on the 29th (top) floor and at the end of our first day, a chilled bottle of bubbly was waiting for us in the room when we got back along with a lovely handwritten card.The location is absolutely perfect as it's not right in the middle of the tourist traps but it remains so central that getting anywhere is an absolute breeze. We found we walked nearly everywhere when we were there, which we would definitely recommend doing if you're visiting for the first time. The in-house events are definitely worth going to (we went to a live music show in the mezzanine bar, which was awesome) and the rooftop terrace is an absolutely fantastic addition.

I have stayed at a competing ""micro"" hotel on several occasions and was familiar with the room style before I booked it. I visit NYC 3-4 times per year and spend 75+ nights per year in a hotel.Based on reviews, I reached out to the GM via email to ensure that a ""sky view"" King would actually have a a view. She replied promptly and stated that they recently changed that category to higher floors based on guest feedback. Since that was the reason I selected this hotel, I was glad to hear that and pleased with the quick reply.Arrived about 4 pm and room was ready. Agent never did confirm my room type so I asked about it after she gave me keys to ensure I was not going to go upstairs to the wrong room. Usually it's common to confirm the room type so that was noticeable.The room - It's very small. And yes, I knew that going in but what I did not account for is the poor use of space. The hanging area is too short to hang slacks without folding them. The cabinet above the hanging area is very tall but has no shelves. Perhaps it is for your suitcase? I had to pile clothes about 8 inches high on the base and was constantly having to shuffle through it. Small shelf was primarily occupied by the phone and clock radio. Zero drawers in the room and only one other retractable shelf that would house a glass of water or two. Cannot walk around the bed so if you are with someone they will be climbing over. TV is on a floor mount that protrudes into the walkway to the bathroom. Shoulder hit that TV at least 3 times in 4 days. Bathroom sink has little storage and they opted not to put another shelf below so it is open the to floor. The shower is half glass wall and it seems they added a shower curtain solution for the other half as an afterthought. The space is just poorly designed all the way around and the design is not even conducive for one guest. I cannot imagine two! Climate control in the room is on a motion sensor. It was a real pleasure to come back to a room that was 85 degrees when it's 90 degrees with 90% humidity outside. Closing the shades in the following days helped a bit but the downside to these all glass rooms is that they are like a hot house and some get full afternoon sun in the Summer months. As a paying customer, I'd like to decide myself when to save power and energy.Service - upon arrival I called down to ask if the pillows in the room were feather or foam. I honestly could not tell and tags were no help. Spoke to Ethan who was going to find out and call me right back. That was a few weeks ago. Still waiting to hear from him. :) Housekeeping did what they needed to but with such little space it really consisted of making the bed and clean towels. The cords on the lights above the bed were COATED with 1/3 inch of dust. Still there when I checked out. At one point I dropped something on the floor and push the curtain aside. A puff of dust released from the base. Did the same on the next panel - same dust cloud appeared. This is not acceptable in any hotel but these tiny rooms in a new building is inexcusable. Housekeeping missed the mark. My experience improved elsewhere in the hotel. Chris and Marvin in the lobby bar were fantastic. Great service and made for a pleasant stop there or on the roof on several occasions. Staff on the rooftop bar and the takeout counter in the lobby were also great to deal with. The truth is, the bar/restaurant staff brought this review to three stars and deserve more but the room and cleanliness won't allow for more. Rooftop - love them and hate them. At Arlo, it is open to the public and advertised street side. Had the unfortunate experience of waiting 25 minutes to access my room because hundreds of people were going to the roof to see the eclipse. A one off for sure but the elevators are truly horrendous. 1 of three goes only to the 9th floor. Also, ALL of the staff use those elevators to move around the property. Every time I got in, there was 1-5 team members that had stops 1-2 floors up. Stairs? Service elevator? Again goes back to poor design. Many reviews mention the elevators and others do not. I can only assume it's based on occupancy and time of day. It is one of the worst elevator setups I have experienced in NYC. I wanted to like this hotel and was excited to stay here. The design flaws in the room are too much to get past. I may visit again for the bar/restaurant staff but I will be going back to the other micro-hotel with superbly designed spaces, full room automation and a gorgeous rooftop lounge for hotel guests only.","Chandler, Arizona","Joski69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chandler, Arizona</strong>",271,3.0

When we checked in it took us about 10 minutes to get to our room. Often, the key card for the lift didn't work either, maybe this is something the hotel could look into?

The restaurant Massoni is by far a 5 star restaurant and you'd regret it if you didn't go! If the weather is nice definitely check out the rooftop bar The Heights.

It was very close to the subway station so it was super easy to get to other neighbourhoods like soho. The hotel is very lively at most times of the day - the on site restaurant and rooftop bar drew in a lot of locals and hotel guests so there always seemed to be lots going on. We had some drinks on the roof one night and it was crowded standing room only - but the drinks were good!The elevators were SO SLOW, mostly due to the amount of people. Not once did we click the button and just go up - there was always a wait. Rooms are super small - but that's what this hotel is micro rooms. They were well planned out and we were content with the amount of space we had. We booked the sky room - and the view was AMAZING. We could clearly see into the room that was next to us since it stuck out on the corner - thankfully there are drapes and black out shades for night. Only issues we had with the room was with the complimentary wifi and cell phone service . Our room had zero contention to the wifi or wireless network. Thankfully the Password protected employee wifi did work and the front desk happily gave us the log in. Luckily we were able to use that wifi on our phone as we weren't making any phone calls having no cell service was okay. But if this would have been a business trip where I needed to be able to place phone calls this would have been an issue.Overall this is a great hotel , very trendy and cool great for young people !

Unfortunately when the rooms finally were available they were on the 21st and 19th floor. Having booked the King sky rooms, we expected skyline views from both rooms, that did not happen. the 19th floor room had ""Brick Wall"" views, not what we had dreamed off. If you book because of the sky line view...be sure to request above 20th floor location.The roof top bar is well laid out, great asset especially to the Hotel owner. Being open to public this place could be the Achilles heel to NoMad. Being crammed in an elevator with party goers at midnight, when you are going to your room, may not be everybody's dream. The fact that these ""outsiders"" can step off the lift where ever they want, may also be a security issue. The roof top bar is off limits to under 21 year old's after 4 pm..!! , useful information that the Hotel should include on their website. Aircon is loud and generates cigarette smoke smell when in use...and last but not least..walls are relatively thin, so when you wait for the lifts (and you will)..well you can hear that not all customers are having a bad experience at the Nomad.

Best for working alone or small meetings. So don't stay in your room, get your business done on the second floor. It's pretty quiet for the most part.Relax:Rooftop Bar! - Yes. It's a thing in New York. You have to come happy hour at some sort of rooftop bar. Arlo nailed it. You have a 270 degrees view of the city, the empire state building. The drinks are on the pricy end (12-16 per cocktail) but the selections and executions are good so pay up!Bar #2 - located on the second floor. You can consider this is a lobby bar but on the second floor. A big lounge space where sometimes there are jazz or musicians performing in the eveningYoga in the morning - Arlo partnered with an external studio to bring yoga classes to the hotel rooftop. I signed up the one on Monday morning and it was wonderful (7-8am). If you are a guest you can sign up for a discounted price of $15. Gotta try it!Biking in the city - One of the best things staying at Arlo is to use their free bikes to go around the city. If you live long enough you know during certain hours the street traffic is so bad your best option to go from point A to point B is either walk or a much faster option, bike. Be aware of the traffic, and respect the traffic rulesEat:Really good coffee at Bodega which is the cafe right across the front deskRefresh:I have never heard of Blind Barber before but their shampoo, soap, conditioner, and lotion became one of my favorites. Unfortunately, only the lotion you can take home. I am going to come back again the next time :)","New York City, New York","HotHotelReview</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",38,5.0

I had written in my reservation I was celebrating my anniversary and as I checked in I was wished a Happy Anniversary. Upon arriving to my room (sky room view, 25th floor), I was simply amazed by the view. Our room was in the corner and we were able to look over Midtown NY. The room was decent sized, not big but not too congested at all. The bathroom was also very interesting and sleek, just as the rest of the room was. The shower had a rainfall head and the toilet had two different flushes. If you needed anything extra (towels, sheets, pillows, etc.) the staff was quick to bring it to your room. Also, there were two wine glasses, a bottle of wine, and a chocolate with a little sign saying ""Happy Anniversary"" on the table waiting for us. If you wanted other things to do, the rooftop had a great view as well!

Even if you don't want to spend too much money in the delicious Massoni restaurant, there are numerous other places to eat within seconds of walking! The micro room was a bit difficult to manoeuvre with two large suitcases and hand luggage, meaning we had to keep our bags packed and tucked wherever they would fit, and you'd want to be very close to anyone you're sharing a room with as the bathroom is only separated by a sliding frosted glass door which, at certain angles gives a view of the toilet and anyone sitting on it! The two elevators serving most of the rooms meant long waits, particularly around check out time, but they were spacious and we could usually fit once it arrived! The rooms were cleaned very well every day at reasonable hours, leaving very high quality toiletries in the bathroom, and the staff were very helpful and organised - Janell offered to look after our bags after we checked out and ordered a car to bring us to the airport, which we were so thankful for!Overall, we had a great experience in this hotel and will definitely recommend it to friends heading to New York in the future.","Dublin, Ireland","Aoife H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",8,4.0

Excellent polite professional people, the Empire State Building view from a City Queen room, the card and treats/our 10 year anniversary, the unique clean hotel, a bar on the second floor, a study/work area, beautiful UNIQUE decorations and artwork, the 32 floors and elevators/3 of them with a tic-tac-toe game on the wall to play during your short wait (come on its 32 floors high) , the bar at the top of the hotel (price $$), with a view of the empire state building and a portion of a glass floor where you can stand and look down at the street below, the beautiful restaurant on site, “Massoni” (price $$$), the “Bread and Butter”place (Price $$) right around the corner and so much more that I’ll probably forget to list something. WOW, the people because that is what matters the most. Carley, answered the phone when I called from a hotel in Jersey that just over charged me on incidental fees and I wanted to make sure Arlo Nomad wouldn’t do the same. She assured me that they would not, but there is an incidental fee at Arlo Nomad. She was also professional by not slamming my current sleep-over hotel and explained hotel policies to me and how it should work, but sometimes doesn’t with OTHER hotels. Then Cindy, she checked us in and gave us a wonderful room. She could also see the conversation I had with Carley right there on the screen, wow people communicate here. Then Jeanell, checked us out when we had to leave, she seen I looked upset about leaving beautiful “New York City”. She gave me a hug and welcomed us back as guest or just to stop by and say Hi. And Cordell a tall professional manager that let us leave our bag while we explore the city a bit more, and the person who retrieved that heavy bag. And a BIG shout-out to how clean the staff keeps this hotel. We always seen someone wiping/dusting/cleaning. And some of these reviews state how small the rooms are but the city queen room is just the right size, with every area made useable. I didn’t see children at this hotel because there are no double bedrooms. I’d say it’s an adult environment that we enjoyed very much!!

Could do with more space for clothes-the large cupboard above the wardrobe is a bit redundant as it's too deep and high up to store clothes-a shelf with two clothes boxes would be a better use of space.

It feels like you spend forever waiting for lifts, and frequently have to actually queue. It's particularly bad when the rooftop bar is busy. As a hotel guest, I begrudge having to queue to get to my room with people simply trying to access the bar. Secondly, for a newly renovated building, the air con in the rooms is really noisy. That said, I would happily return. The rooms are really well thought out. Yes, they are small, but this is clearly stated. I had a standard room, which was great for me. May have been a little tight for two. The location is great. Just away from the hustle and bustle, but central enough to access all the main tourist areas. Finally, you're never far from building work in New York. However, there is a big building sites almost directly opposite. You may be better requested a room at the back if you are a light sleeper.","Brighton, United Kingdom","PhilG-UK1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brighton, United Kingdom</strong>",50,4.0

The rooms are small but they make efficient use of the space and there is plenty of storage space under the bed for your suitcases. The bathroom was a full sized and plenty of room. Only thing I didn't care for was the shower only has glass on half and you have to use a curtain for the rest which doesn't come all the way down so your floor definitely gets wet, even when using the bath mat. Not a huge deal though. The bed was large and very comfortable. The pillows were a little too soft but it wasn't anything horrible. The closet was a little small but we made it work. Loved the automatic blackout shades for when we wanted to sleep in a little bit some mornings. My only issue with our particular room (1901) is while it had great views from one window (the New York Life building is stunning), the other side was nothing but a brick wall. I asked for a higher room at booking and once again after we were assigned this room but they weren't able to accommodate the request. So that was a bummer but it is what it is. The staff was very friendly. The only thing I wish they had done was put in a service elevator for staff and rooftop guests. From the time people get off work to the time the rooftop bar closes, the elevators are packed with people and it can take a very long time to get to and from your room. Also, the staff uses the regular elevators so we frequently had to stop at multiple floors to pickup/drop off staff members. However, in the grand scheme of things, this isn't a deal breaker. The location in midtown was great. You are within a short walking distance to all the subway lines and shopping! I would recommend staying at this hotel and will likely return some day.","Carrollton, Virginia","jwilk241</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carrollton, Virginia</strong>",12,4.0

A service lift would enhance the nice experience of staying here.If you take the 'breakfast included' rate, note that if you exceed $15 on the breakfast menu you pay the extra.

My girlfriend and I stayed at the Arlo Nomad for a night over Memorial Day weekend and our stay went perfectly. From the moment that I booked with Arlo I felt at home and well taken care of.

This is when I met Elizabeth Santana. I truly couldn't thank her enough for the job that she did. Elizabeth was a pleasure to speak to over the phone or via email any time I reached out to her and from that point on I knew we were in good hands. Not only did Elizabeth personally decorate our room, but she was able to get us a marvelous view of the Empire State Building, she got our room set up early and allowed us to check-in ahead of schedule, and she even provided us with a complimentary bottle of champagne. Without Elizabeth I'm sure our stay at the Arlo would have been fine, but thanks to Elizabeth Santana and her EXCEPTIONAL service I refuse to stay anywhere else in New York City whenever I visit. The hotel it self is very clean, smells great and has an amazingly warm and friendly staff. although we were not able to dine at Massoni I've heard great things and can vouch for the drinks at Barlo and the Heights, they were great.

Other items are reasonably priced by comparison.Now the rooms, they are VERY small. If you can, book a high floor with floor to ceiling glass on 2 sides of the room, Sky King would give you this and possibly Sky Queen. For me, this compensated for the lack of space. You wont get much of a view on lower floors, we were on 25 which was fine, they go up to 29 so higher the better.Bathroom is good, lovely shower and good quality full size products.Storage for clothing is minimal so if you are away for a couple of weeks as we were be prepared to use your suitcase for storage. We had bags of toiletries literally on the floor as there was simply no where to put everything.Good size TV on a stand which is great if you want it but takes up vital space if you dont.

Because this weekend was a big deal to me, I contacted the Arlo NoMad directly to make sure my reservation had gone through correctly. It took a couple of tries to confirm but Evelyn was so patient and kind with me on the phone through repeated phone calls and I was SO thankful for her help! She made every effort to set up our stay to be a fabulous 16th birthday weekend for my daughter, and she was successful! My daughter was even greeted with ""Happy birthday!"" by the people who checked us in on our arrival.Our room was, as advertised, small - but with an amazing view of the Empire State Building with the floor to ceiling window and the room was so cute. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we loved the full-size shampoo, conditioner, and body wash in the shower. There was a sweet card with a few treats on the nightstand for my daughter to celebrate her birthday from the staff and just made it extra special for her. We fell in love with the entire hotel and the staff. Luckily we were able to meet Evelyn as we checked out on Sunday and she was awesome about giving us some advice (and printouts) for how to get around the city for our excursions that day. Evelyn was truly awesome! (Not to discount the rest of the staff who were awesome as well, but she really made the trip special for us.)I wish we were able to stay longer to enjoy the amenities of the hotel, but we will definitely be back!

From the minute we walked through the door we were made to feel really welcome. Liz greeted us and I told her we'd booked because of the excellent reviews and she gave us a free upgrade from 10th to 22nd floor. The room was great, it was tiny but the suitcases went under the bed and we had enough room for two, after all you're out exploring most of the time. The bathroom was quite large and they provided complimentary shower gel and shampoo, towels were changed daily. The bed was so comfortable and my Mum who complains that she can't sleep was snoring like a 'good un'.We had breakfast and dinner some nights in the restaurant and it was always real lovely. The location of the hotel is perfect for seeing the sights. The roof terrace was breathtaking and it was lovely to sit and have some drinks.The reception staff Zachary and Liz were always helpful and showed us places on the map and gave us useful tips.I would definitely stay here and highly recommend it.

At $295, my room was a cubicle that could fit at most—tightly- one person with a carry on. The floor to ceiling windows were cool, but on the 16th floor, I could only see the back wall of a couple of ugly buildings. No bed side tables, but I improvised one with the little bathroom vanity bench. I hopped into the shower after a 5 minute wait for the water to warm up, just to realize the tiny bathroom was getting all wet. The half-way glass shower door did not keep the water inside. Obviously too late, I then realized I could have MANUALLY extended and attached a shower curtain to close the gap… But the greatest problem were the three elevators…. Many people packed into a narrow hallway waiting for several minutes. Unbearable. And to make matters worse (I realize this was just bad luck), the internet and cable TV crashed for two house in the early morning (when I was supposed to be working…). At that point, feeling claustrophobic and desperate, I gave up on the Arlo. I checked out early at 7:30AM and walked a block to a different hotel.

The smell while entering was pleasant. My wife and I kept discussing and wondering what kind of air freshener was used because every time we entered the hotel during our stay, there was that nice, refreshing, pleasant smell. The lobby chairs and couches were comfortable. The décor looked very stylish and swanky. It made the experience great and exciting. When checking in Zack helped my wife and I and he was perfectly professional. We arrived very early, way before check in time, but he assured us he would help us get into our room early in which we did at a later hour. He even upgraded our Sky Room from one with a queen bed to one with a king. We were also able to leave our bags while we ventured out into the city. When we returned to get into our room a little early, Carlos helped us. He was very professional and helpful. I mentioned I was very tired and he noticed and offered a coffee. That was a nice touch to hospitality. After getting into our Sky Room he promptly brought our bags they were holding for us. Everything went very smooth. My wife and I were very pleased. Our room was on the 19th floor. Very nice! What an incredible view!! The room in person was just like the pictures found online. No smoke and mirrors online to make it look better at all. It looked just as great and felt even better. Clean, comfortable and refreshing. My wife and I couldn't stop talking about how comfortable the bed, pillows, sheets and comforter were. Oh, and the shower head, wow! We need one of those at home! We only had our room cleaned twice, and it was done very well with our personal items being left alone and in place. Everyone we encountered affiliated with the hotel were very professional, nice and hospitable. For example, when we requested additional toilet paper and towels, they were delivered very quickly. Zack even brought a tray with a card and a small bottle of wine with glasses up to our room because it was known my wife and I were there on vacation for our wedding anniversary.The location of the hotel was pretty damn great because it was close to everything we visited New York to experience and most likely every other tourist would want to experience. One more thing, about the roof top lounge/bar. You must go there at night! Talk about a breath taking view of the city including the Empire State Building that basically looks like it's right across the street. Amazing! If we return, we will definitely be choosing to stay there again. We had absolutely zero issues, so my wife and I have absolutely zero complaints.

The rooms were clean though and had good toiletries, and offered all facilities including a steamer which was handy. Overall the hotel staff were friendly and offered recommendations for places to visit. The décor of the hotel was funky and it has 3 bars, the best one was the rooftop which had great views of Manhattan and Empire State. Definitely recommend a visit. Downstairs they also have a coffee bar and sell croissants, pizza etc. The hotel also offers complimentary bikes for those willing to explore NYC this way but the city roads are pretty busy so I guess you need to be experienced. The location of the hotel is only 15 minutes walk away from the Empire state building and Macy's etc so really good.

We didn't have the best view, facing perhaps another hotel (?) but we were hardly in the room to mind much. As others have noted, the aircon was loud however with earplugs, this was not an issue. On our first night, we did find that our room was not visited by housekeeping, however this did not occur again and we found that those working in the hotel (maintenance, housekeeping, front desk) were friendly and happy to help. The location of the hotel is top notch - it was close to everything we needed and a great base for our stay. There are plenty of places to eat around the hotel (particularly if you're a fan of Korean food) and there is a place next door called Bread and Butter that has some decent salads ($9.99 per pound I think) if you're in dire need of fruit and veg.The supplied umbrella is VERY good quality, we loved having a steamer rather than the traditional iron and an ironing board and the two tv's for each bunk level was a very nice touch, though it seemed that the TV guide supplied by the hotel on the actual television seemed to display upcoming TV shows, rather than what was actually on TV (not sure if we misunderstood the purpose of the guide but we did think it frustating). We noted on arrival that there was no safe in our room, upon which one was quickly installed when we notified reception. Kettles can be requested. The rooftop bar has an amazing view of the Empire State Building and was a breath of fresh air in the evening though it gets very busy. Others have noted the elevators were very slow - we did not have major issues with the lifts. On several occasions during our entire two week stay, it took in excess of 5 minutes for an elevator to arrive, however in most instances, we did not wait very long (having expected wait times of up to ~15 minutes based on other reviews). This may or may not be because we were on the 10th floor. The layout of our room was such that the bathroom was contained in one section, i.e. the sink was not connected to the desk so we found the bathroom to be more than satisfactory. The bathroom door is frosted, however the frosting does not go all the way up or down the glass. It is adequate if you are comfortable with your roommate. The shower itself does not have a door, but has a shower curtain. There is more than enough room to change in the shower space/area (which is very large comparative to the room) if you are concerned about privacy, as the curtain AND the frosted glass together are more than enough to cover the parts you would want to cover (yes, we tested this lol). The shampoo, conditioner and body wash were SOOOO nice, absolutely loved the scent and found that the products were very good quality. The hairdryer is a small one, however it is very good and got hot enough so that it didn't leave my hair feeling greasy afterwards (tip here, don't waste luggage space on a full size hairdryer like we did!). The only thing that I think would be a nice touch in the rooms would be a full length mirror somewhere.To summarise, we both really enjoyed our stay at the Arlo and based on our experience would recommend it to others. It was very clean, modern and the room to us was very smartly designed to maximise space. As an FYI - we did originally book an airbnb to stay however we changed our minds and paid the extra for this hotel. It was well worth the extra $$ and we were so glad we chose this hotel.

Not having to pay $300 + a night is equally as nice.I was greeted by a friendly reception clerk who was from Frisco, where I currently reside, and I felt at home right away. My upgraded “micro” room had floor to ceiling windows on two walls, and staring into Gotham City ahead was exactly what the doctor ordered. When my grandkids came to visit, we visited BARio lounge on the second floor, and while the adults enjoyed a beverage, the kids entertained themselves with board games.

Despite the glowing reviews for great customer service, I found my experience to be the opposite. I found a great rate on HotelTonight and called the hotel directly to match it, only for the reservations agent to state that they don't match rates like that. When I checked into my room, I was given the worst possible room on a low floor and looking to an air shaft and straight into neighboring office buildings, not the glorious skyline views. When I asked to switch, they stated it was not possible (and most likely because I booked through a third party website). Upon checking out, the manager told me that they do in fact match rates from HotelTonight, and said I could have asked for an upgrade if booking directly. Too little, too late. To be fair, the actual room was nice, clean, and well laid out - perfectly suitable if you are traveling alone, but way too small for a couple or a family.

I've stayed in a few New York boutique hotels but often find them to be dark and poky. This hotel is super modern, trendy with plenty of light coming into the bedrooms. Since it has 31 floors, many of the rooms have incredible views of Midtown Manhattan. My room had a view of the Empire State Building. I arrived at the hotel super early at 9am and check-in wasn't till 3pm. I didn't expect them to have a room ready at all, but the guy said: ""I have good news and bad news - your room is almost ready, but you'll have to wait 5-10 minutes."" I wouldn't call that bad news! He even gave me a Fiji water to drink while I waited. The service was excellent - the staff there really go out of their way to explain everything and make sure you feel at home. The lobby is super trendy and there's a little takeaway cafe where you can buy snacks. The pizza is incredible!!! Definitely get a slice before you head out for a day of sightseeing. You can also dine in the Massoni restaurant or have a drink in the bar. The hotel is central in Midtown so you're close to all the major tourist attractions. Neighbourhood is safe and not super crowded like Times Square.Do not leave the hotel without going up to the rooftop bar for the views!! Seriously you can see the whole of Manhattan. If you don't want to pay to go up Top of The Rock or Empire State then go up here for views. Rooms are compact (it's New York after all) but incredibly well designed. As I said, great views, plenty of light, light colours. They have everything you need, including a steamer, hairdryer and Blind Barber hair products. You know it's a good hotel when they give you full bottles as opposed to the mini ones...Shower is a proper rain shower. Mattress is super thick and bedding comfy. I had the best sleep! The high-design feel means they've made the best use of the space. Plenty of plug sockets, overall an incredible experience.

With that said I still don't know why micro hotel refuse to give the bathroomsMore privacy (that is my only real complaint with micro hotels). Room 1806Pros:- the sky view room lives up to its name.- the bed was comfortable- the shower was amazing- staff were very polite - the lobby/extra areas were decorated. I rly (we didn't really use these much)- the roof deck is nice and has amazing views (side note that it appears it may get quite busy at night so I am not sure how the seating situation is up there. It appeared a lot of non hotel guest go there)Cons:- elevators. By far the biggest issue in this building is the elevators. The elevators themselves are fast but they only have 3 of them but 1 only services the first few floors. They have a system so that you scan your card and pick your floor and it will try to program the most efficient way but a lot of people don't use it which causes congestion I think. You will literally wait 5+ minutes for an elevator. The elevator is also used heavily by hotel staff which adds a lot of extra stops. Just be prepared for the wait. - Details. From my understanding this is a fairly new hotel but there are lots of little details they make it look older than it is. Missing trim in the hallways, bad patch jobs over nails in our closet, etc... the. Things that weren't thought out well like the blinds for he windows. The chain to use then is tucked in the corners and makes them hard to get to. Also to bring the blind back up took a lot more force than I would expect. - White bedding shows everything. The bedding is all white which is fine but it also means it shows everything. When we got in our room you could just see some hairs and stuff on the bedding along with some makeup or something on the pillow case. -AC. I don't know why but he AC seemed weird in the room. With half the room being windows it gets warm in there. We had the AC set at 70 and it literally comes on every 5 minutes. The room also always felt a bit humid. It want a big deal I just like a dry cool air and this felt more like humid cool that had to turn on every 5 minutes. -Bathroom. It is a micro hotel with a micro bathroom but I still feel they could be done better. There is nothing to provide privacy from an audio stand point. It is all glass. Also there is no shelves or hooks or anything in the bathroom except for the towels. So you either need to put your clean cloths on the toilet or they stay outside of the bathroom. Add an exhaust fan or a white noise generator to help with some of be privacy issues. Conclusion:The Arlo Nomad seems to be on par with the micro hotels I have stayed at in the past. I personally would like to see someone break the ""norm"" of a micro hotel with some the issues I explained above(issues I have with micros in the first place). The Arlo has a few things they could improve on but then again anything in my price range generally will. The staff was friendly and the building was nice. I would have no problems recommending this hotel, but like any micro hotel make sure you know what you are getting.

But I read about the Arlo hotels, and thought they might be too good to be true for the price and the great location, but read Trip Advisor & thought I'd take the chance. I have not regretted it. Currently in my room, awaiting to check out and it's been a great stay. The staff are the friendliest I've encountered in NY. Great welcome upon arrival. Straight in my room despite it being 1.30pm when I arrived. I've stayed in other hotels in the US where they've reconditioned an older hotel, but NoMad have really done this well and despite the odd smell in the corridor on my floor (8) which I suspect might come from previous smoking floor? It is the only issue I have throughout my own stay and didn't follow in to the room. Great sound proofing, I didn't hear any of my neighbours. I really liked the inhouse products too, so much so that I'm considering buying some. One of the best things is the fact that this room doesn't have lots of red or blue lights from electronic equipment to affect your sleep. Expertly designed. Yes the rooms are small, but for me in an urban queen as a single traveller it was perfect. Much more storage than when I stayed at The Standard. Really smart under bed storage, perfect for your suitcase. All those things that annoy you about hotel rooms have been addressed such as a full length mirror, decent TV channels. I love the fact you have a mini fridge that's empty so you can put your own choices in there. The bar looked great and the bodega in the lobby is excellent if you want some ""treats"" a bagel for breakfast etc. I would recommend this hotel to everyone I know. Location is superb, 10 mins walk to Penn Station and Grand Central for getting out to airports/upstate. I never normally stay mid town, normally chelsea/meatpacking/lower east side, but I really appreciated being near so much and in walking distance to so many great areas. Someone has really thought about this place. The small details like the message board from other guests making recommendations and the hand held steamer in your room, so much better than a iron/ironing board situation.

The breakfast at the cafe is great in concept, weak in implementation -- felt a little like staff was having a bad day.

By the time you have two suitcases on the floor opening various doors is like a puzzle game. However rooms were very clean and modern, shower was awesome and the floor the ceiling windows gave a brilliant New York feeling. The food in the bodego was delicious - I recommend the avocado grinder! Staff all helpful and friendly. Biggest downfall is the elevators!!! We had to factor in an extra 5-10 minutes before leaving to go out just to get downstairs. Often one of the two was out of service and with both the guests and the service staff all trying to use one lift it became a joke between guests while waiting around.

We stayed in a bunk room which was very clean and modern. It had two super comfy beds with a tv at each end, a decent sized bathroom with a lovely big shower and a small view of the Empire State Building from our beds which was a nice bonus! Yes the rooms are small, but we managed just fine - even with 2 huge suitcases. Just 2 minor downsides to the room: - The bathroom didn't feel very private as there is only a frosted glass wall/door that felt more like a shower screen dividing the bathroom from the rest of the room.- The Air con did not heat the room evenly. It was situated opposite the top bunk which made it very hot up there at times while trying to heat up the rest of the room.(Considering we paid such a good price for a modern, comfortable and well located Hotel In New York during the Holidays, we weren't too bothered by these things!)Location was also fantastic! You're just off 5th avenue with everything you could possibly need around you. Just a few blocks south of Herald Square/Empire State Building, very close to the Flatiron district and walking distance to both Central Park/Times Square and Lower Manhattan. Close to everything without being right in the middle of the touristy areas. The service was excellent and I was very grateful when a kind gentlemen at the service desk helped me after I left my phone in the car that took us to JFK. He was quick to contact the driver and had it express shipped to my next destination as a courtesy of the hotel and arrived only 2 days after I left New York.

I needed to be in midtown so decided to try this sister hotel. So I am partly basing my review comparing to my excellent stay which brought expectations, but also more objectively based on other hotel stays.Overall I really enjoyed my stay. Positives:-Very clean. Very modern and new. -Very comfortable bed. -Very clean, well stocked bathroom linens. -Umbrella in the wardrobe was a very welcome addition given it was torrential rain on one of the days I stayed. -The common area on the 2nd floor is just an amazing space. I was able to work from my laptop. Super spacious with such a nice vibe. Negatives:-My main issue is the elevators. Only two. Super slow. Too the point that on two occasions I decided not to risk going back up to my room as it would take too long to go up and down. -Front desk staff definitely not as friendly or welcoming as the Arlo Hudson Square (which was one of the reasons I loved the Hudson Sq property)-The bar on the 2nd floor beside the amazing common space doesn't open until 5pm. Seemed such a shame that sat there at 4pm I couldn't get a glass of wine or even a coffee. Seems a wasted opportunity. -No complimentary water in the room. Minibar empty so none available to purchase. Going down to the lobby to purchase is just not convenient especially with the crazy slow elevators. Overall I am a big fan of this Arlo chain.

On arrival we were greeted so kindly by one of the lobby hosts who gave us some great information about the hotel and the local area. We were given our room 2206, a sky view queen room. We walked in and could not believe our luck! It was simply beautiful, small but perfectly formed! Great use of space. Our view of the Empire State Building was a hell of a welcome to the city! We travelled as a couple, thank goodness we were comfortable with each other as the bathroom door was made of glass not an issue for us but worth bearing in mind for others who may not wish to be quite so intimate. The bed was very comfortable, high enough that most suitcases would fit underneath to allow more room. The safe is also located in a drawer underneath the bed. Pillows are very very soft, I had a problem with these but my partner thought they were the most comfortable he had slept on, so as usual it is different strokes for different folks and you just can't please everyone. The room also came equipped with a mini fridge, a steamer, a hairdryer, great products by a brand called blind barber. We loved the hotel so much we wanted to continue our stay there when we returned from a short break to Boston. On check in for the second time, we were given the same warm welcome despite the lateness of our check in (we were delayed by the snow storm). We were allocated room 2408 this time, a king size sky room. The lay out of this room was very different, you could not walk around the bed as it was up against the two floor to ceiling windows. The bathroom door was glass with a gap at the top, a bit too personal even for us. And no desk. The space under the bed for suitcases was even more limited. To add to all this the bed creaked and crunched every time you moved in it, which 24 floors up and against a window was not conducive to the most comfortable of nights sleep. We asked the lobby if there were any other rooms available and they were incredibly helpful allowing us a room down on the 6th floor with a layout more like our original layout and a much more comfortable, less noisy bed. We asked to remain in this room and the staff gave us two free breakfasts to make up for the issue, totally unnecessary as it was our problem not theirs but very kind none the less and appreciated given the current exchange rate. I cannot fault this hotel, they are friendly warm and welcoming. The location is amazing, we absolutely loved it. We would stay here again in a heartbeat.

I stayed in a Queen bed room with a city view. I have stayed in many hotels of all kinds in many places worldwide especially in NYC. What you get in Arlo is a room with everything you may need without excess space. The room may have less floor space but they have a good height. First you enter through a modern reception that is opposite a trendy ""Bodega"" concept that is open 24 hours. It'll sell you everything from a cup of coffee, a soda, to a slice of Massoni Pizza. The reception furniture is a modern mid century revival and it leads you either to a restaurant: Massoni, or to the elevator hallway, it also has a staircase that leads you to two ""studios"" one is a large area with sofas and lounge chairs with a large meeting room table and a library, the other just the large meeting room table and a library, there is also a bar on this floor and an open court that is carefully and tastefully designed.The room itself is a combination full bath and bed area. The bath and toilet area is encased with privacy glass on one side and the sink, a utility stool and a seat stool desk combination on the other side. The shower/bath area is separated from the bed area by a good size hanging closet, that has a safe, and small fridge, and above a large cabinet you can close with a door. The bed virtually covers almost all the space, but it does have a small seating couch on one side, a good size nightstand, a nicely finished headboard. The bed is good, not the best, but it is good. The bedding is euro white, better quality. The TV is a newer model, nice size, and you get most of your desired channels. WiFi is included and it has great reception. You can move the TV as you want with its full motion bracket, and this allows you to connect any HDMI if you want to use your laptop or iPad.Things I liked was the service, how nicely appointed the rooms are. The reception and the studios were great and I didn't feel crowded. For an NY visit where you want to be out of the room most of the time. This is a nice place to be. Now, for family travel, you have to consider a larger room and the mechanics of the bathroom sounds and privacy glass. If that isn't an issue for you. This is a great place. Though do note that many modern hotels are going this route, even larger ones like the Riu Times Square. Some reviews here complain about heat and noise. I adjusted the temperature as I wanted and had no issues. As to noise, the only noise that bothered me were the clocks installed in the headboard. I think a better redesign using a led display should fix this. It's a nice design to have them, but the ticking is loud. As instructed I pulled them out and removed the batteries and no issues. This is a great hotel and I am hoping many more like these spring up elsewhere. I will stay here again if the prices are commensurate enough.","The Woodlands, Texas","SuitcaseLawyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>The Woodlands, Texas</strong>",105,5.0

We were so pleasantly surprised at how delicious, hip, and fun both the bar and the restaurant were. The food and cocktails were impeccable. We are making it a point to visit Massoni next time we visit NYC. Anyways, we had a late night.

The rest..where to start.. The advertised view is on a high brick wall on one side and a construction site on the other. This construction site is also causing incredible noise all day, in the room, there is also noise from very loud AC, and you can hear all of the conversations of your neighbours. The AC also lets in smell of smoker cigarettes and cooked food!The rooms are extremely tiny, even for New York standards and feel like prison cells. There is only a mini closet for your thingsz The hotel has just opened but the cheap furniture is already cracking and peeling away.One person will feel cramped, for two it's very uncomfortable and simply too small.

The emails where to confirm that the hotel would have a new year event on with access to the roof. They replied stating there would be something on but access to the roof with some champagne. No pre booking was mentioned nor was any cost or maintenance. Upon arrival after the very slow and unprofessional welcome I.e the brief moment of not knowing how to check us in, I asked about New Year's Eve celebrations and roof top access. The reply infuriated me, you have to pay $$$ for a meal and a toast on the roof. We are now fully booked but if you pay extra we can try and fit you in. Followed by ""roof access is not aloud due to health and safety and will not open up till the summer"" this confused me as they had just stated if I payed $$$ I could have access to the roof. Clearly this hotels health and safety do not come into consideration when extra dollars are involved. The only saving grace from this trip was the maintenance man, who apologised when he over heard our conversation on the lift to the room and said that because they were too far behind on build the bar on the roof and the furniture the management wouldn't allow people on the roof as it could make them look bad. He then told us the door was unlocked, took us up and took our photos. When asking about having the New Years meal we were told that no menu had been created but it would be several hundred dollars but did it include access to the roof as stated above. Very small rooms for two people but at least it does state they are micro rooms so to be expected. About the only thing they did well. Such a disappointment at how poorly this hotel is ran and how poor communication is between the staff. I felt embarrassed for them. Much better hotels to be booked.

However, probably one of our favorite meals during our time in NY was actually at the restaurant IN this hotel! There is also a coffee bar that served amazing lattes in the lobby. Our departing flight got delayed by about 5 hours, and I was so thankful to be staying in a hotel that had such great amenities and allowed our delay to be so enjoyable! Even though we had checked out, we had dinner and drinks in the restaurant, and then spent time reading in the 2nd floor library/study area [which is gorgeous and cozy], with a yummy latte from the coffee bar. We then were able to go to the roof top and take in the incredible 360 view of New York at night before catching our Uber ride to the airport! There were also 2-3 different bar/lounge areas in the hotel, so just a lot of space and options for hanging out.

The location is convenient, only 3 minutes walk from the nearest subway station. The hotel is very new as it opened six months ago. The room is tiny but nicely renovated. It is cosy and the bed is comfy. The shower is particularly nice and I like the lemongrass smell of the body wash & shampoo. The drawback is the view. The room has large French windows but the view is blocked by the neighboring buildings, unless you stay higher than 25/F (29/F in total). And the air con in the room is loud. You need to switch off the A/C at night, otherwise it will wake you up at night. The customer service is below par. The staff are friendly when you speak to them face to face. But when you have problem, it shows their service level. Here is my experience: I checked out at noon time and then headed to the airport. At the airport, I found out that I have left behind a small yellow beam bag in the room. I immediately called the front desk and told the lady which room I stayed and the description of the beam bag. She said she will come back to me in email. After arrived home, I heard nothing in the email. So I wrote an email to them repeating the same thing and also attached a photo of the beam bag. After three days, there is still no feedback. Maybe they are just too busy and could not care less. I would like to use this space and relay a message to them: The beam bag is a gift from my son so I treasured it dearly. If you found it, I would like to hv it back and I will pay for the postage fee. Appreciate if you can get back to me whether you find it or not.

There's really nothing we would change about our stay here. It's a $27 ride from the LGA airport and the style here was everything I'd want in a city apt. Also close to Empire State building and MSG. It was compact, but not cramped at all! The room was spacious in areas you'd want for like the shower and bed, but not a lot of extra room that you don't end up using. Our view was incredible on the 27th floor. The bed touched 2 of the floor-to-ceiling windows and the blackout, automatic shades made it easy to sleep in. The design is modern and trendy with clean lines, and I almost felt like we were in an Ikea sample room at times. There are about 10 rooms on each floor and 30 or so floors. There's lots of little things I loved about the hotel I've never noticed about other places. They didn't have mini soaps, but large bottles to use from. They had an umbrella to use while you're there which helped on wet trips out. The staff was top notch and we always felt welcome. They had an on site Bodega downstairs that is open 24-7 which was super convenient for our nights staying out late. They have a new trendy on site restaurant that we didn't get to enjoy but heard great things about.The first floor near the elevators had an assortment of index cards where people wrote suggestions on activities, places to eat, things to see, and we thought that was pretty awesome! The elevators on each floor had different ink variations of that number and it was a unique and cool way to add a little flair to each floor. Free wifi was quick and easy to connect to.

Really small. Don't expect to have more than two people stay in a king room. If you don't like small spaces or are not very comfortable with the person you will be staying with then skip it. We loved it and will stay again. Here's why...Perfect location, close to shopping, SSSSuper swank design - check out the common areas, good food in the restaurant, two great bars, and 24 hour light fare, the staff on point at all times, all conveniences (except a coffee pot and micro) in the rooms even with their small size, great rainfall shower head, amazing views, and let me tell you, I am going to get my hands on one of their mattresses. Someone commented that it isn't very sound proof - I didn't find it any different than other hotels I've stayed in but I like white noise so I just left the fan in the ON position on the AC and slept like a baby. We were very happy customers as we strolled to the front desk to check out. And then, they made us even happier. It was raining and we had to get somewhere with our luggage. They called a car service, insisted on taking our bags from us so we could go sit somewhere comfortably to wait, and told us they would come get us when the car arrived. When the car arrived they insisted on loading the luggage then, downright refused a gratuity when my husband tried to give it to the gentleman helping us. We were without an umbrella and were going to purchase the loaner in the room (it's a great umbrella with the ARLO logo). However the front desk gave us the option of a complimentary black one so we were given a brand new umbrella to take home. I expect this type of service at higher priced properties but not necessarily at the price point we paid. What a pleasant surprise. Bread and Butter on the corner is fantastic for any light groceries and fantastic variety of take out. Even had a good gluten free grocery selection. Accdientally found Friedman's just a couple of blocks away. They specialize in gluten free and our two meals from them were amazing. This gluten-free girl was very happy. Would love to see the Nomad offer at least a gluten free bread and pasta option in the future, but beyond that, I can't think of anything I would want to change.

Booked the place because it had very high reviews and the price was right. The hotel was a mixed bag of good and bad. First the Good:Reception was easy and the staff were pleasant. Room was very small but functional and bed comfortable. I would not recommend this hotel for two people in one room. All rooms are similar in size and two people would probably fumble over each other all the time. The location is central and good with lots of food options and services around. Now the Bad:They have a 24 hour food stand in the lobby. The coffee is awful and the staff are rude. I would never say that if it were a one-off but each time I bought something (maybe five times from different people) I felt as though I was seriously inconveniencing them. In any event, this is not a big deal. Can be fixed with new coffee beans and better staff training. The bigger problem is the elevators. I think the building is 32 floors and there are only two elevators that service all the floors. Problem is as you expect, it takes a very long time to get the elevator. Once I waited about four minutes for the elevator which was too full for me to get on and then another two minutes. Doesn't sound like a lot but when you are waiting it makes you crazy especially if for example you have to go up and down a lot. It's worse in the morning and around dinner time. And oddly, there are almost always more employees in the elevator with large carts than there are guests; so both elevators always feel like service elevators that are often too cramped to get into. Finally, my sheets had holes in them. I didn't say anything as I didn't really care. I presume the cleaner saw the holes on her own and replaced them the next night only to find large brown stains on the sheets she replaced them with. They of course replaced those. Short of it is that I think they need to invest in new coffee, new sheets and better training of the food stand staff. As for elevators, not sure what they can do there other than perhaps have staff only use the elevators other than in emergencies in off hours and not rush hour. I might say there again only because the price was right but would more likely opt for a different hotel.","Toronto, Canada","alwaysontherun2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",80,3.0

Only negative is that a maintenace guy knocked on our door at 9am our last day asking ""Are you leaving? Because I need to do some repairs in this room.""

After browsing for a bit I came across the Arlo Nomad. Let me tell you...Great prices, amazing service and perfect location! I got in at about 11pm and was exhausted. I was greeted by the lobby host, Carlos Callado. He was so nice and very helpful. First, he upgraded my room to a city view which is what I had originally wanted but being that I am on the companies dime I did not want to expense the upgrade. He first upgraded me to the 17th floor and then said let me do you one better and get you a higher floor with a better view. He got me up to the 21st floor with a view of the Empire State Building. I was stoked! Then I asked if there was a place to get a glass of wine.. he said of course and walked me over to the restaurant to introduce me to the host. He then offered to deliver both my wine and my bag to my room. I was so appreciative because I had been traveling all day and just wanted to relax. The next night I purchased some food from the 24 hour snack counter and a different lobby host helped me. He was so sweet and after I picked out a few things I noticed a candy bar.. then quickly noticed it was $6.50. Sticker shock set in and I told him maybe not tonight. Well he said don't worry it's on the house. After eating it I realize why it was $6.50.. it was sooo good! Definitely going to buy one before I head back to the west coast.I also ordered food through a delivery service a few times and each time the delivery guy was escorted up to my room by one of the security guards at the hotel.

Only in town for one night for a Broadway show, I scored a fantastic deal off Travelzoo for a queen city view room.

The room is perfect for one or a couple or two very good friends (the bathroom area has one of those frosted glass sliding doors). I very much enjoyed the whole microhotel design and the waterfall shower room was heavenly and had amazing smelling products by Blind Barber (my Brooklyn friend loves the stuff and he said they have a cool bar too). The hotel lounges on the second floor are a fun place to hang or work and there's a rooftop area, too (although closed during winter I think). Check-in was a breeze and I have to say this was one of the friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered: Jeanell at reception was really great.

Situated central to tourist locations. Just round corner from Empire State Building. 15 mins to Times Square, 20 to 25 mins to Central Park. Easy to get underground again just round corner. Lovely roof top view, when bar is finished soon it will be fantastic. Rooms at back great view of Empire State. High floors obviously best view. Had breakfast one morning, good service, food ok, vdidnt like sausages but that's probably my taste. Cafe in foyer great to get warmed up croissant and tea/ coffee before you head out for the day. Atmospheric bar and relaxing areas, attentive bar staff. Rooms small but have everything you need. Cleaned to a high standard daily. Comfy beds. Great shower. Safe provided no extra charge. Hair dryer, steamer. Only improvement would be a kettle but foyer cafe is easy to access to take a drink to room. Would highly recommend a stay here, they even provided umbrellas when unfortunately it rained, heavily! Reception staff friendly and informative. We visited over the busy new year period for 5 nights. Would stay here again if we go back to New York, which we'd love to. A fun, vibrant city with so much to see and do.

It's a short walk from Penn Station and a couple of blocks from Herald Square. Microhotel is an appropriate term for the room I stayed in. The studio was just big enough to squeeze by the foot of the bed to get to the window but for one person, it was fine. I had to use my computer and phone to make some calls for work and with the free WiFi there were no problems, although it helped that I was comfortable working on the bed. The bathroom is tucked away once you walk in and features a rain shower head and good water pressure and warm water. I also ate in the restaurant downstairs which was very good and will review in a separate post. Elevators were a little slow upon check in around 5 PM but otherwise no wait upon checking in or out. They also have a bodega in the lobby with food from the restaurant. There's a bar/lounge on the second floor but I didn't check it out. Crowd in the lounge seemed young-ish, but at my age many people seem young-ish! I would stay again, although I'm guessing that once word is more out on this place, i won't be getting much of a deal on TravelZoo, so enjoy it while you can.","Collingswood, New Jersey","kt3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Collingswood, New Jersey</strong>",87,5.0

The coffee was excellent and it was a prefect way to start the day.The bar was well attended in the evening and the study centre comfortable if you want to sit and chill.

My mother and I fall into that second category. We are go-with-the-flow, seasoned travelers who don't ask for much when it comes to our accommodations with the exception of three things: a bathtub, a comfortable bed, and peace and quiet. Unfortunately, none of these needs were met, even after being promised several times a quiet room with a bathtub. We stayed in 2409, a Queen ADA room on the 24th floor with no bathtub, located right beside the elevators. The bathroom was poorly designed- glass doors that offered zero privacy or any sound barrier. The shower had a flip down seat and a handheld shower head. The bed was quite possibly the most uncomfortable contraption I've ever had to sleep on (aka my mother and I didn't sleep a wink).

Because there were no official photos of the bunk room we were sceptical and expected it to be unbearably small- we were pleasantly surprised! The room is bigger than we expected and fit both our cases and us comfortably. There is a desk and chair also. The beds are great they are not your standard bunk beds but larger, more like full sized single beds with very thick mattresses stacked on top of each other. You get two thick soft pillows each too and proper thick quilts to keep you warm in the winter. Lots of plugs in helpful places closes to both beds which is always a bonus! The bathroom is fantastic it is big with a separate shower and toilet- the walk in shower is huge, really powerful and plentiful hot water. The only annoying thing is the frosted door on the bathroom- nobody needs to see that!! There are decorative clicks on the wall which tick- if like me you find this annoying, it's very easy to pull the clocks out and temporarily remove the batteries. The wifi only worked in part of our room but we were beside the elevators perhaps that interfered with the signal.The entire hotel is lovely since it's all new. The elevators have some fancy logic built in that tells you which car to get and pre selects the floor for you- this should stop the need for drunk people hitting all the buttons 'for a laugh'.Reception guys are really friendly.

We arrived early so we knew they would hold our luggage until check in time but what I didn't expect was Zarif.. We told him we were early and wanted to check our luggage so we could go walk around Midtown. We told him we were there to celebrate my daughter's 18th birthday and said let me check on your room. He said I have a room available now and I had requested a Queen Skybox room because of the view. Zarif said, I do not have one available now but we should have one shortly. I gave him my cell number and within an hour or so I received a call from Zarif stating he had our room available and what time could he expect us to return to the hotel. I told him within an hour and he said great we'll see you two then. About 30 minutes later I get another call from Zachary at the hotel verifying the time of our arrival. We get to our room, the first thing we see is the New York Life Building standing in all its glory right outside the huge floor to ceiling windows and a silver tray displaying two mineral waters, pastries (which were delicious by the way) and a hand written birthday card to Charlie my daughter from Zarif, wishing her a Happy Birthday along with two breakfast tickets for us to enjoy while we were there. First thing we felt was welcomed and comfortable.. Now let me tell you about the room, the views are phenomenal day or night.

The Blind Barber toiletries in the shower also smelled amazing.The staff were really helpful and swift in their actions; lent us brollies when it rained and replaced a charger accidentally broken by housekeeping.The location is also in cllose proximity to Flatiron, Herald Square and the Empire state building.

We were about a 5 minute walk from Macy's and the other way down the street was the Flat Iron Building. Our room was on the 25th floor and had an amazing view of the Empire State Building. The room itself was not huge but as we did not spend huge amounts of time in the room it did not concern us. Everything had a modern design and the bed was super comfortable. There was two huge windows which gave us panoramic views from our bed. The shower temperature did fluctuate in temperature at peak times in the morning and evening. We ate in the Missoni restaurant and had the pizzas and pasta dishes. Everything tasted really good. We didn't have breakfast at the hotel and the bodega was a bit expensive especially compared to 'Bread and Butter' just up the road. The staff were very friendly and helpful. We stayed for New Years Eve and were pleased to see extra security to stop non guests from reaching the hotel room floors.

Always polite. always available.)Rooms:TINY. I'm a small person who's stayed in small European and Japanese rooms before. But when I say this room is tiny, I mean TINY. Bed is huge, which is nice, but literally right up against the window with no space to walk around it (climb over your partner if you're sleeping on the window end). 2 large suitcases? Be prepared to climb over them when open. One chair, so the other person will have to sit on the bed. It was cleverly designed for such a compact size, but seriously, we could've done with more space.Epic fails in the room include- Angled TV right beside the toilet door with no swivel function, you'll hit your head if you don't open the toilet door wide enough. SUPER DANGEROUS.- toilet door is glass with an opaque strip that doesn't even go all the way to the top - if you're not a couple who's comfortable living on top of one another, avoid this hotel as there is ZERO privacy when using the loo!- Shower sprays EVERYWHERE. Be prepared for an extremely WET toilet floor after showering. This kind of thing drives me nuts.- Showering temperature was a little hard to control as well - too hot or cold at times.- No space for toiletries. One washbag with hardly anything in it? No problem - but your washbag may get a little wet from proximity to the tap. Peeps who want space to lay out your toiletries for easy access? Forget about it.- Our tap had started to leak and spraying in all directions.- No complimentary cotton pads/buds/toothbrush/toothpaste (but there is a 24 hour CVS 3 blocks uptown)- No kettle, no bedroom slippers - stardard american hotel problems.- Extremely dry air and hard to control thermostat.- No bathrobes - considering how cold the room can get due to the above, it would've been nice to have these.- Air conditioner/heater is VERY noisy. I didn't have an issue as I'm used to noise but if you're sensitive, you won't get much sleep with it on.- Bedside table is a little slide out panel on one side of the bed only.Wins in the room include- empty minibar fridge for your use- power shower head - pressure was amazing (which also meant the whole toilet got wet as there's no door for the shower)- loads of USB plugs and right by the bed - perfect placement- Space to hang clothes- Thick fluffy towels - these ended up on the floor post-shower to soak up the swimming pool that the bathroom floor became.- In-room safe nicely tucked away.- Clean.- Great view (just wish we had one of the empire state) with the corner windows - felt like we were floating in the sky.- Complimentary wifi worked well.- auto shut black out blinds were great.- Lighting in the room was great - especially the bathroom mirror!Everywhere else:- Decent but expensive coffee from the 24hr bodega in the lobby.- Bagels from the bodega - decent but I've had better- Lovely communal spaces for a drink or chat - because these can't be done in room due to their TINY size.Location:- Kind of in the middle of everything but still in the middle of nowhere. Sure there's easy access to lots of things uptown, and you're not that far to downtown, but I'd rather stay in Soho / Nolita next time where there's greater access to breakfast food, shops, bars.- It's in Korea town. There is a great korean restaurant next door called 'Her name is Han' - check it out if you do stay. Also a 24 hour korean deli/supermarket on the corner of this street.- Also check our aussie restaurant Ruby's for brunch/lunch which isn't too far from this hotel.I enjoyed the trip but I wouldn't stay here again due to the location, tiny room size and the wet bathroom.","Singapore, Singapore","DLPA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",111,3.0

""No..."" ""No one has, we've only been open a month!"" That friendly encounter explains why there are relatively few reviews for the Arlo NoMad, but it will get popular quickly. The hotel is nicely appointed, great location for visitors, smartly arranged. We got one of the bunk bed rooms, which was new to me, but really worked out well. It gave my niece and me each a sense of our own space and freed up the rest of the otherwise small room. It actually felt like the room could use another piece of furniture (maybe a comfy chair?) because the space was so open.The location was great for a few reasons: as others have mentioned, proximity to the Empire State Building (especially if you visit at night-- highly recommend!); walking distance to Penn Station; much quieter than hotels just a few blocks away; a number of late night bites in Koreatown.There were some downsides (though none would be a deal-breaker for me): rooms are small (but I've stayed in smaller, more expensive rooms in NY); our room was supposed to be ready at 3p but it was nearly 6p; the shower is potentially lethal (you need to turn it PAST hot to adjust the temperature); the bathroom door is frosted glass and doesn't reach all the way up to the height of the door jam (which might be a little awkward-- just think about it).Finally, the staff was fun and welcoming. I think I met Carlos (several reviewers have mentioned him) the manager at the front? I pointed out the shower problem and he acknowledged it was something they would have to address in the next few weeks.Overall, really enjoyed the Arlo NoMad and will definitely put it on my short list for my next trip to NY.","Washington, DC","imho828</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",14,5.0

Arlo NoMad is an excellent hotel that I would both return to and recommend to others. The best thing about this hotel was definitely the staff - they are exceptional, and every interaction was perfect. Another great feature is the location - we really enjoyed the area, and it's convenient for access to the subway and is walking distance to many restaurants, shops and sights. Being able to walk to dinner was a huge plus for me.Regarding the hotel - we really enjoyed the common rooms on the 2nd floor - both the sitting room and the library. We brought our take-out to the dark sitting room on a couple of occasions, and were surprisingly all alone. I don't think too many people have discovered this room! My husband really enjoyed the library, and spent a few hours there over our visit. As many have mentioned, there's also a place to hang out on the roof - really great view! I believe I read that this area will have a bar in Spring 2017. The hotel has a ""bodega"" (a limited, hotel version) - we got breakfast and snacks from them a couple of times, and found it very convenient. And we were amazed by the speed of the elevators - fastest elevators we've ever experienced in any hotel.Now for the room - we had the Urban Queen and found this big enough for both of us (and my husband is about 6'). We made use of the closet, little drawer and under-bed-storage. The bed was super comfortable - if you have issues with soft pillows, just ask for another one. The in-house toiletries were actually really good quality, and I appreciated that they were just barely perfumed, but still smelled great. The room was serviced everyday and was very clean our entire visit. There is an in-room telephone, in case you're wondering.But I found there were a few issues that would prevent me from giving them the full five stars, as follows:- The lobby was perfumed, which became sort of cloying and noxious over the visit. It didn't give me a headache, thank goodness, but I really didn't like it.- The bathroom. This can't really be helped, though, since the hotel was designed this way. Yes, the toilet and shower are essentially one room, and the door doesn't close completely - it just slides shut, but there's about a 1 cm gap that prevents needed privacy. Fortunately, we didn't have much of a problem, but we're pretty comfortable with each other. For friends, well - go to the 2nd floor bathrooms if you need to be able to close the door. The shower does leak all over the floor - the shower curtain tends to blow in and stick to you. The floor dries quickly, so it's not a big problem, but again - in my opinion, the whole bathroom has an annoying design.- The worst issue...the noise. I woke up every single night at around 12 to 1 AM, with the hotel blaring rap music into the hotel (you don't hear it outside oddly - not sure where it came from exactly). This can be mitigated by staying on a higher floor (we were on the 7th floor) or wearing earplugs. The latter is what I would do if I were to visit again. I understand street noise - it's NYC after all, but what's with the constant, all-day music? And why does it have to be rap? I get the impression that this hotel is trying to project a certain image and attract a certain clientele. I'm young (which I gather is their preferred demographic), but like most everyone else, I appreciate a good night's sleep, and I didn't get it. Above all else, the main function of a hotel is a place to sleep. I think they sort of failed at this. Play the music during the day, keep it low after 10 PM - this is an issue with an easy solution.TL;DR - overall a great hotel with some really awesome features, would return & recommend, but poorly designed bathroom and 5 not-so-great night's sleep - do yourself a huge favour and bring earplugs! Otherwise, I loved my visit!","Toronto, Canada","cacahuatl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",28,4.0

The location can't be beat, steps away from tons of restaurants and mid-town Manhattan.The rooms are, well, micro. We knew that going in so it wasn't a surprise that the sink was part of the entryway rather than in a separate bathroom. The shower was large and comfortable too. Sure, it got dicey for me to go to my side of the queen bed b/c I only had about 8 inches between the front of the bed and the wall with the TV, and both sides of the bed had power plugs, but only one side had a space for you to put the item you're charging down; I'd recommend maybe some small shelf on the other side so both people could have easy access to their charging electronics from bed. These are the only times the smallness of the room got in the way.Since it's a micro-room, storage is well-designed since each inch is valuable; the bathroom sink shelving was very helpful to unpack my bathroom stuff, and we had plenty of storage to unpack into.I didn't get to eat at the hotel restaurant, but the pastries from the lobby coffee shop are stellar. The brownie alone was REALLY REALLY good, and if you think it's silly to call out a brownie in this review, you haven't tried it.Anyway, great staff, great room, great location.

Even though I was grumpy on check in from a headache and the long flight, it didn't stop them giving me first class service. Previous reviews have mentioned the size of the rooms and whilst they are on the small size, I wouldn't say that wouldn't stop me staying again. You don't go to New York for the hotel stay! Saying that, the rooms were comfortable, clean and the shower was fabulous! The room also come with a powerful hairdryer something that usually let's you down in a hotel stay especially with thick hair but that wasn't a problem.When I booked it there were no reviews and I was nervous but thought concerns were soon put to rest and I had a fabulous stay and will look forward to a return visit. Hopefully in the warmer months so I can visit the rooftop bar when it's open.Finally, I found the location to be perfect too. Its just 2 or 3 blocks from the Empire State building which is ideal and if you buy any tickets for the tour buses it means there is also a stop just around the corner as they stop outside there. Its only 10-11 blocks from Times Sq which is close enough to walk but far enough to be away from the 24/27 buzz and noise. You're also only 3 blocks from Macy's and Madison Square Garden so I found the location to be perfect.

A stark contract to the welcoming lounge and chairs at their other hotel location near Hudson Square and Soho.My initial room was the bunk bed room which was very comfortable except for its location next to the bank of elevators so you would hear the elevator dings from several floors all day/night.Fortunately, I was able to upgrade to a queen bed room down the hall.

As soon as we walked the staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome. I have to say this was a theme throughout our stay. We were impressed by the consistent attentiveness and genuineness of everyone working at the front desk, in the lobby bodega and at Massoni (the restaurant on the main floor). The staff even surprised us with anniversary cupcakes once we'd settled in. Great personal touch!The room was a very cleverly laid out and comfortable despite it's tiny size. I'd say it's ideally suited to a single traveller, but we managed to have a lovely anniversary night nonetheless. What sets the Arlo apart is the style and quality of its amenities. We had some of the best pizza we've ever had at the lobby bodega... and enjoyed the tea, coffee and gorgeous snacks they serve. Massoni was spectacular. We had some perfect old fashioneds in the front bar on the first evening, and enjoyed a truly UNBELIEVABLE Massoni brunch the following morning. The rooftop was another great feature. Try the plunge deck! We can't wait to go back once the bar opens up there. Such a stunning view of Manhattan! The second floor bar wasn't quite open yet, but looked to be shaping up beautifully.
