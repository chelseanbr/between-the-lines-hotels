The staff were very courteous and upgraded me to a suite, free of charge. The beds were soft and clean, and despite being in the middle of midtown there is great soundproofing and my stay felt serene. Enjoyed the full bath and bathrobe. Didn't take advantage of the room service but they are affilitated/attached to an Indochinese restaurant that I know to be very good. Will definitely recommend to my family and friends that they stay here--whenever they are allowed to visit again!","New York City, New York","Scarlett M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",0,5.0

I also liked that they had suites available at a reasonable price point—allowing our family of four to have ample room. The San Carlos Hotel was all this and more! My husband, who travels for work often, told me we must stay here again the next time we are in NYC. This is high praise coming from him! When we entered through the doors of the hotel each evening after a long day of sightseeing, we were always warmly greeted and felt relief to be back in our comfortable accommodations.The following story will explain why we will be returning to this wonderful hotel: Shortly after we checked in our first night in New York, my son told me he smelled smoke in our room. Then his eyes started to become very irritated and he didn’t feel well. He is very sensitive to smoke. We called the front desk and they sent the wonderful Manny up to assist us. He tried to determine where the smoke was coming from and my husband and Manny concluded that someone had been smoking in the hallway. Twenty minutes later the smell was stronger and we realized it was coming from under the door that adjoined our room to the room next door. Manny was still in the hallway trying to neutralize the smell of the smoke so we alerted him to the situation. He approached the front desk on our behalf and we were offered a new room with an upgrade for the entire duration of our stay! Wow! We were blow away by the fact that Manny and the front desk resolved our problem so quickly and without any fuss on our part. This experience made us loyal customers of The San Carlos Hotel each time we are in NYC! They take care of their guests.Details about the room: The hotel beds are comfortable with high end sheets. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. The kitchen area had a bigger mini-fridge that had plenty of room for half gallon sized cartons. We ordered breakfast items from Target (delivered via Shipt) and enjoyed starting our day slowly enjoying breakfast in the room. There was also a microwave and small coffee maker. For Father’s Day we ordered bagel sandwiches from Ess-A-Bagel (on the next street over) and avoided the LONG line by ordering via Yelp. Location is amazing! We bought unlimited 7 day metro cars and rode the subway all over Manhattan. So simple using City Mapper app. Subway stations are very close to the hotel. We walked easily to 5th Avenue shopping, Top of the Rock, great dining (loved The Smith), St. Patrick’s Cathedral, and Grand Central Station. The whole family felt safe exploring the area surrounding the hotel as it was full of tourists, professionals, and locals. Safer and different vibe from the chaos of Times Square.Excellent experience! We will be back!",,284meredithb,11,5.0

We had a room with two very comfortable double beds and a ‘kitchenette’. The latter was a bit disappointing as we had expected a little kitchen. Instead the kitchenette turned out to be a microwave, fridge, coffee machine and cutlery for two people. However, in practice this was enough for us to have breakfast in the room each day. The hotel does not provide breakfast, but we bought bread from a lovely bakery nearby and had breakfast in our room in our own time. Ideal for a family with teenagers. The room was cleaned daily, not super good, but sufficient. Also a good gym. The best feature of the hotel is its location. Walking distance to Central Park and Rockefeller Central.

The staff was very friendly, especially the cleaning staff. The main drawback was the condition of the room, in particular we had windows that were in such poor state that we had to barricade them with pillows and towels to prevent the wind from oozing through (this was in february, so the wind was very cold).Also, the “resort fee” was quite expensive at 32 USD per night, for free wifi and access to a gym that was honestly just a few weights, a few cardio machines and a single multi-cable station.I might choose this hotel if i I come to Manhattan again, but not in the very cold or very hot months.","Valby, Denmark","658oscarb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Valby, Denmark</strong>",3,3.0

We stayed for two nights in a Jr. King Suite and the room was an amazing size for NYC, one of the largest we've stayed in. Definitely room to spread out for families. Loved the kitchenette with the small refrigerator that actually had a mini freezer. Aveda bathroom tolietries were a plus. Didn't have much interaction with the staff but they all seemed friendly enough. Now for the mixed feelings.... The rooms seemed a little dated - was a bit surprised with all the stains from the carpet to the pillows, etc... it's not that it didn't feel clean, just a major turn-off. There wasn't any sound-proofing with the hallway door. You could hear everything going on in the halls, including the guy who was walking his crying baby up and down the hallway for 30 mins. Also when you walked down the hall to the elevators, you could hear everything going on in the rooms from conversations to showers, etc... not that we were listening, just how thin the doors were! There were people slamming doors behind us on the first night (seemed like ALL night) and the wall between us would actually shake. The hairdryer in the bathroom was terrible and definitely needs to be updated. No reading lights provided by the beds. The pull-out sofa bed was not comfortable (as expected) and they only provided one extra pillow and a hotel grade blanket in the closet - we had to call for more pillows. No ice machine, was told that ice was by request only. We had to call once again for ice....see where this is going? I guess though the biggest kicker was the additional fees - $30 facility fees per night (even though we knew about this upfront.) Also, if you wanted a roll-a-way it was an extra $30 per night. I know that there are many hotels that are charging these fees but there are still many that are not. As much as we loved the large room, we would probably stay at a place where everything was included in the cost of the room. In addition be aware that there is construction going on next door - we were on the farther side of the building but could definitely hear it in the morning.",,cnrstone,10,4.0

Had a one bedroom premium suite. Requested an extra half bathroom which is in the lounge area and we were accommodated.

Asked reception the following morning for a toaster and this was delivered the same afternoon. My daughter was also given balloons and wine on the day of her birthday. We can obviously say from all the above the service and helpfulness of the staff is outstanding. My personal opinion is that the decor is not very modern but more traditional, I thought it was lovely though and it was spotlessly clean and kept that way for the duration of our stay. Large apartments with excellent air conditioning, it was a little noisy but did not disturb us. We were on the 7th floor, there was outside noise, but this is to be expected in central New York. The apartment we had was quite dark even although we were lucky to have a street view. This is due to the closeness and height of the opposite buildings. There is also major renovation happening at the hotel next door which is very noisy during the day, but again, this did not affect us during our stay.The location is excellent, subway 2 minutes walk away. 5th Avenue 15 mins walk, a little further to central park. Supermarket 5 minutes away and lots of restaurants and cafes on the doorstep.

We had a junior suite so the room was large but we cannot comment on the size of regular rooms. The sleeper sofa in the room and its size meant that it amply accommodated three people. Cleanliness and maintenance is at a four star level. The décor is high quality and in Art Deco style which will appeal to some. They provide bottled water and robes in the rooms, and umbrellas for guests in the lobby. The lobby itself is nothing special. The hotel is deep on the east side but near the 6 train so its easy to move up and down the island. Cross town is a bit more tricky. The gym is a good size and all four machines were working. Only true negative is that the walls are thin and we could hear the people next door.

The beds are so comfortable and its so nice to come back from a busy day exploring to a clean room and ready made bed for you to jump into. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful with bags and recommendations etc. The location is also perfect as you are close to many attractions such as the Rockefeller Center, Grand Central, Times Sq etc and anything you're not close to, there is a subway station on Lexington. I did stay here before in 2014 and its nice to see that the standards haven't dropped and it is still a lovely hotel to stay at while in NYC.

Check-in was easy. The room was nice. A little dated, but clean and functional. The A/C in the main room was loud when turning on. I would say the room is on the larger side when comparing to other New York hotels. The major issue that we had on the trip started on the 1st day. I noticed that I could not connect to the hotel wifi. The hotel sent someone to the room who basically just showed us how you would normally connect to the wifi network on a device. After multiple back and forths it became apparent that the wifi did not work in the main room of the suite. The room with the 2 queen beds where I spend all 4 nights. At one point the hotel had me contact the wifi technical support who provided some help. The problem soon returned. Just to be clear this was not one device with a problem. This was a galaxy S8+, an iphone 7, iphone 6s, ipad mini, samsung tablet, and an ipod. All of these devices would not connect in the main room. After telling me to call technical support and then the problem reoccurring the hotel seemed to wipe their hands clean of the situation. They told me that they would waive the hotel resort fee and that was it. Nobody called to follow-up, no attempts were made to rectify the issue, nobody acknowledged the problem on check-out. I even mentioned this issue on a post check-out survey that was sent to me online after I left. Still no contact from anybody at the hotel. For close to 800 Canadian dollars a night I would expect that someone would address the issue and rectify it. Have the IT department come and add an extender/repeater/booster etc... It is hard for me to believe that nobody else has had an issue in this room (Hotel said they have never had an issue in this room before.). The hotel management ignored the issue and hoped it would go away. I was happy with the stay otherwise, but the handling of this issue negated all the positives. I would not stay at this hotel again. I expect hotels of this caliber to take care of issues not hide from them.","Maple, Canada","endogary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maple, Canada</strong>",8,3.0

I was there during a heat wave, and the aircon was incredibly refreshing. The hallways weren't cooled, though, so it was a little stuffy between the elevator and the room. My accommodation was terrifically spacious! I had plenty of room to spread out (which I'm known to do). I wish I had a luggage rack to open my suitcase, but I used the extra sofa in the room instead. The desk provided additional room for me to stash personal belongings. The bed was comfortable and the linens were soft. The bathroom felt a little industrial and outdated, particularly in comparison to the rest of the furnishings, but it was clean and useful. I wish there had been more counter space in the bathroom for personal items, but the desk in the bedroom was near enough.Overall, a great hotel!

Having been to NYC many times either on holiday or as a commercial ship's captain, I have stayed in many of the good hotels in the City. On this occasion with my wife.... this is our first time at the San Carlos Hotel. From the moment we walked through the doors there is an air of peace about the foyer. We were met by Doorman (Andy) with our cases and Gabriel on the desk and made to feel very welcome.The front desk or any of the Doormen will help you with advice on how to get around or whatever.There are some very good restaurants close by within minutes walking This is not your typical large chain hotel buzzing with people and things going on, but a really delightful hotel offering a complete relief from the non-stop buzz of the City.We had a Junior Suite on the 5th Floor which was generous in size and very comfortable.We were privileged to meet Janet Materi handing Sales and Marketing and also the owner of the hotel, something that will never happen in most NYC hotel.Breakfast is available in an adjoining part of the hotel which was excellent.The lifts (2) are good.The hotel is very well positioned for most of the tourist locations be it the Rockefeller Centre, 5th Avenue, Times Square and the subway.On arriving in NY, go to the subway station close by and buy a MetroCard for the time you will be in the City This can then be used in both buses and the subway. Whilkst on a bus pick up a route map. Please note, if you ride a bendy-bus (as we call them in England), you must insert your MetroCard in the blue box beside the bus stop and get a receipt before boarding the bus. If it is a normal bus, swipe your card at the driver's position.Simply a great hotel to stay.

The bedrooms are quiet, spacious and clean. We (two adults and two teenagers) stayed one week. We asked for a rollaway bed to be added in the room as we didn't want to share bed. It has its additionnal cost but it was surprinsigly comfortable.The kitchenette is super useful when, like me, you don't want to spend hours (three times a day) trying to find a restaurant which fits everybody.I would only have two small complains:-the sofa bed in the room is not very comfortable... -the breakfast in the restaurant attached to the hotel was a disappointment..

The lobby was welcoming and the desk clerk attentive. Check in was smooth and the clerk asked if we had baggage...yes, we had just carried it half a mile. We were given our key card and pointed to the elevator. I expected our baggage to be taken to the room (why else ask if we had any?) but the advertised bellman must have been on a break. I had requested a high floor, but even though the hotel wasn't full, we were given a room in the 2nd floor with view of the service alley and brick wall. The room was clean, but the roll away bed we had requested was not there. The desk had housekeeping bring it and, after maneuvering in the tight quarters, it was set up. Our room was directly across from the hallway access door and elevator. All night there were people going in and out, slamming the door. The elevator mechanism could also be heard very loudly, constantly throughout the night. The hotel is in a good location for walking to shops and attractions, and we spent most of our time out and about. However, we did expect to be able to watch a little local tv and weather before turning in. This wasn't possible as the cable was out of order and the programming would freeze every few minutes. We told the front desk and they said they were having cable problems...""sorry, shoulder shrug...should be fixed soon"". It never was. I don't usually use the minibar, too expensive and I don't drink. For some reason all of the mini bar items had been placed in the mini fridge...taking up all of the bottom shelf and the door shelves. The mini bar was there, so I'm not sure why the fridge was being used for this. My kids had to reach over the scotch to get to the sodas that I had purchased for them. I asked the front desk if this was normal...""shoulder shrug, sorry, don't know"".We were told at booking that there was a free continental breakfast, or we could pay $10 for full breakfast next door. There was no free breakfast, or even coffee, available. ""Shoulder shrug, sorry...there's coffee across the street.""I was really expecting excellent service at the San Carlos, and it just didn't happen. Housekeeping was excellent, but the desk staff seemed not to care much. I would have expected to offered something for the inconveniences we had...maybe a breakfast voucher or something off the $30 a night fee for the rollaway, but they acted like the problems were no big deal...shoulder shrug. Would I recommend this hotel?...shoulder shrug...probably not.

The free breakfast is no longer honored, even if you purchased a rate including the breakfast. A discounted breakfast is offered at the Indian restaurant next door.

We decided to pick this hotel due to the good reviews and location of the hotel and the Free WiFi and gym room was a plus. I had booked a hotel room with two bedrooms , a kitchen , and bathroom. When we checked in and went up to our room we quickly discovered that it was a one bedroom hotel room with a queen size bed and a sofa. When I stated this to the staff they offered to give us a suite as it was apparently the only other room available. We agreed on paying the extra $240 until the staff member told us that he had made a mistake and it was actually $480 so we quickly declined and they agreed to make the sofa bed immediately instead. We had to wait an hour for the house keepers to make the bed. The television channels cut off after watching 10-12 minutes of the same programme. The Free WiFi was extremely slow and did not allow me to use it on apps such as safari and Facebook on my Iphone. I was on the 7th floor and was expecting city noise but the windows always seemed to sound open and they let in a big draft. The toilets blocked very easily with more than 3-4 sheets of toilet paper. The shower drain didn’t work well at all and the shower/bath filled up to my ankles while using the shower. The Free shampoos/conditioners/ mouthwashes etc were half full and not sealed which gave an impression that they were previously used.Many light bulbs did not work and the mirrors in the bathrooms seemed to be old as they were scratched and marked severely. The housekeepers came in to our hotel room at 8:30 on the first 2 mornings after just one knock on the door and when they seen me awake and my family asleep they quickly said sorry and left. The beds are comfortable yet very squeaky. We were given four key cards to the hotel room and the four worked up until day 3 when only one worked. On the last night I got a nose bleed and unnoticed got a small patch of blood on the bed , if I had noticed I would have reported it to the staff straight away. I went to dinner with my family and when returning back to the hotel none of the key cards were working. I went down to the lobby to consult the staff when they explained in a harsh manner that they deliberately locked us out of our room due to the small patch of blood I unintentionally and unnoticeably left on the bed. They then charged me $350 for the bed sheet and explained that if there was even a drop of blood on the mattress then an extra $1000 would have been charged to provide a new one. I was also told that the $75 that I was charged when I checked in for insurance Incase of any broken furniture would not be given back.I had enjoyed the very welcoming , polite and helping staff who brought up conversation until I noticed the constant ask of my plans and how long I will be gone. My hotel room had been entered every time I left the building even when I kept the door sign of do not disturb on forgetfully. I know of this because of the constant change in movement of my objects.I really did not enjoy my stay at this hotel and would definitely not recommend it to anyone , have never had such an uncomfortable experience in a place I have dearly paid for and will never be returning to this hotel.

Unfortunately it didn’t live up to the praise everyone else gave it on here. Upon check in, the staff was polite and reserved but I wouldn’t call them warm or welcoming. Unfortunately we didn’t encounter Quron or Bobby until we checked out and like everyone else said, they WERE fabulous even just in the 5 minutes of interaction we had with them. They were very friendly, Bobby held the door for us (no one else had done that when we lugged our luggage in), and they appropriately joked with our kids. The other drawback was when I booked this several month ago, all the reviews and hotel’s descriptions on the travel sites touted “free continental breakfast”. Apparently this is no longer true and now they only offer “American style” breakfast at $10/pp or the upgraded version at the attached Spice Restaurant for $15pp. (Probably because all the TripAdvisor idiots complained about it.) Not a horrible price, but we hadn’t budgeted for breakfast for our stay, so we ended up just getting breakfast supplies at the nearby Walgreens and using the kitchenette in our room. We had a junior suite with a queen bed and a pull out sofa. The bed was comfortable enough but the kids complained the pull out was uncomfortable, but I guess that’s to be expected. There is no ice machine, so you have to have them bring it to you if you want ice...but then you feel obligated to tip each time. I will say, when we had asked for ice and extra blankets, the service was extremely fast, so that was a plus. It was also pretty quiet at night which was nice. As everyone else pointed out, the location was great and I doubt you’d find a cheaper hotel with this great of a location. In all, we may or may not stay there again. I guess it depends on what you’re looking for. ","Willowick, Ohio","210aprilf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Willowick, Ohio</strong>",9,3.0

We assumed Manhattan didn't have many gas stations so we filled up on our way in. When we picked up the car it was on empty, so much so that we were panicked we wouldn't make it to a station.

On the first night my TV was having issues with the signal and I was unable to watch certain channels. The next morning, when I turned on the TV to get the news and weather, I had no signal at all.

Front desk and concierge get 6 stars. All requests dealt with first time on time. First class. The room is nice and had we not stayed at The Kimberly across the street previously we would have agreed with what others have said. However the room is smaller, has no balcony and the air con units stick out from the windows eating up more space. Fittings in our room were tired, especially the bathroom. The hotel is indeed quiet and the night we stayed we rested well. The problem is the price, we paid double the rate almost of a newly rennovated luxury suite in the Kimberly!..and I'm afraid it is not as good. Maybe we just got a poor deal. Breakfast was included but we were genuinely shocked by the poor quality of this. Continental fair that was all dry and mostly inedible. No choice of cereals or juices (1 of each). Also situated in a small room where you feel you are tripping over other guests. Several had to lift hot coffee over the heads of my children to get through the tables for example. Not safe and not comfortable. So value on that was negligible. So overall a tired building and poor breakfast are letting down what clearly are superb staff.

There's only one member of staff there to restock the food etc and it's not her job to clear the tables for next guests.

Our trip in June with our granddaughter had been planned for some time and we let her choose which hotel we would stay in (from a screened list, of course). She chose the San Carlos based on its proximity to Ess-A-Bagel (see my next review for that). What we hadn't realized was that it sits smack on the crosstown bus route. What a deal! While our granddaughter but 10 years old, she is a seasoned traveler and we don't spend our money on taxis or Uber'ing. There are too many other places to leave your money.But enough background. If you're reading this, you want to know about the hotel. I will repeat that the staff is fantastic! From the front desk to the doorman to the housekeepers, you are made to feel welcome from the start. We stayed in a junior suite that offered a king bed in one area with a sofa bed in the sitting area. The room was a nice size but we did have to move the coffee table into the eating area to open up the bed. There is a very functional kitchenette with a refrigerator, microwave, coffeemaker and sink that was very convenient. It was nice to be able to bring leftovers back to the room.There was only one television, which makes sense since the sound of two would have conflicted but it is well situated and could be easily angled so that it could be viewed from both bed. The only conflict was which channel it was set to (remember the part about the granddaughter).The room safe was not operational but we didn't mention it to housekeeping or the front desk until we left as we really didn't need it. I suspect they resolved the matter.The bed was very comfortable, the linens were of good quality and the bathroom was well appointed but had little room to put shave kits or makeup bags. The shower uses a curtain rather than glass but that is likely a matter of age. The hotel has been there a while and little things like that make that obvious but most everything has been updated. Comfort is key to us and we were all happy with the San Carlos.The San Carlos is right across the street from the Kimberly, which is about 25% more and is probably more upscale but unless you intend on spending a lot of time in your hotel, why would you pay the difference? We were there on vacation and the inside of any hotel isn't what we came to see.Need to sleep? This place is very quiet. It was unusual to even hear police sirens and being on 50th between 3rd and Lexington puts it in a high traffic area.We like our room a little chilly and our first two days were greeted by mid-90s, deadly hot, but the room was comfortable the entire time and the housekeeping staff did not take it upon themselves to reset our air conditioner setting when they did the room. Nothing is more irritating than a housekeeper (or hotel policy) that resets the thermostat as a part of making up the room. When you've worn yourself out in blistering heat, you don't want to come back to a stuffy room regardless of the time.As for the continental breakfast, I'm not sure what continent they were thinking of. It is pretty dismal. This is my only detracting statement about the San Carlos. They would be better off disarming their clients of deadly disks that are supposed to be pastries. Yesterday's grocery store Danish that was used for display the day before isn't appetizing ... and you could break a tooth. The coffee is good enough (a positive thing) but overall, not so much on that score.In summary, we'll stay there again and again. Being able to catch the crosstown from Time Square and getting dropped on either Lexington and 50th or 3rd and 50th makes this place too convenient. Going the other direction, the 49th St stop is just steps away. Of course, uptown/downtown busses run both Lexington and 3rd and the Lexington/53 subway station is just a few short blocks north.Traveler note concerning the subway. If you come from the airport using the subway go out the Lexington exit versus the 3rd Ave exit. The 3rd Ave exit is about a million stairs with no elevator ... hauling luggage up those stairs is a real workout.Last word ... stay at the San Carlos ... you won't be sorry.","Columbia, SC","MLDraper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbia, SC</strong>",28,4.0

As there is so much choice and some well know chains to pick from in New York, I had been a little worried after booking. I shouldn't have been. When we arrived the staff were so welcoming and friendly. We were offered the choice of room and picked one on the third floor as it had one and half bathrooms. We had a one bedroom apartment. The room was large, very clean and comfortable. We had lovely soft fresh towels each day, and as there were 4 of us just after check in the maid came with a large bag of toiletries and extra towels. Each morning breakfast is served between 7am and 10am - there is very limited seating but you can take it back to your room so not really an issue. The breakfast choice is limited but adequate. The location of the hotel could not have been any better to explore all the main sites and we got to see everything during the weekend. On the Saturday we woke up to find the next street closed as there was a market which was lovely and also meant that the hotel was quiet that morning which was a bonus as some of the streets can be very noisy but this one wasn't. Would definitely return and highly recommend Trip - we had book airport transfer's via the hotel but found out that all taxis have a fix fee to the airport which was half the price of the one offered by the hotel.

Some external booking engines quote a higher price for breakfast inclusive so don't be fooled by this. All residents of the hotel get the complimentary breakfast which was absolutely enjoyed by us each morning of our stay. Staff are really great and in particular those at reception.

I've had several vacations/trips and stayed in many hotels, but they have been marginal or average, so I declined to review them via TripAdvisor. But our last short trip to New York changed that, as we stayed at the San Carlos Hotel. I'll take you from start to finish:Arrival inside hotel....Updated high end decor. Tile/marble entry and lobby area, with ample sitting/lounge areas.Check in...Lightning fast. Booked through Expedia, so just provided them with credit card information for incidentals. Done in less than three minutes.Room 905...Large and appeared to have been recently updated. Desk area, large chair with ottoman, iron and ironing board, trouser/pant press, microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker. Bathroom was average in size but clean, no lack of hot water issues. The noise level of the room from outside resources was almost silent. Not sure if it was due the height (ninth floor) or upgrades via soundproofing. Continental breakfast. FREE. Plenty of yogurt, pastries, bagels, breads, coffee, orange juice, etc. PLENTY of tables and seats, which is very uncommon for New York City hotels.Location. Perfect Midtown area, walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Theater District and Central Park. Checkout. Faster than check in.Value for the Money. Absolutely.

My family of three kids, all 6 or under, has stayed there several times now. It's friendly, offers great service, and the rooms are fantastic.* The owner sometimes invites families with kids back to his office. He chats about whatever - history, New York, his family - and gives the kids little gifts. Reminds you of the way airlines used to treat little kids, inviting them up to the cockpit and giving them pilot wings.* The suites with the two queen beds are HUGE by Manhattan standards. Dining alcove, kitchenette, an almost too-large living room, bedroom with two queens and still plenty of room for a full size desk, large bathroom. Nothing comparable in this price range in this location with this level of service. A true gem.* Did I mention it's friendly? The maids adore our kids, play with the baby, joke with the older kids. The turn-down service pretty much includes them wanting to sing your kids a lullaby.* Nothing has ever gone wrong. Never too cold, too hot, too noisy, too anything. Everything just is what it's supposed to be. I think experienced travelers know how rare that is.* Some things to consider: the king bed suites are pretty tight when you unfold the couch in the living room. There is a high-rise going up next door - we never heard a thing but maybe if you're in exactly the wrong room you could hear it? Honestly though we've never heard any sounds. The breakfast is good, but there isn't anything like hot sausage or omelets. Mostly things like bagels, toast, cereal, fruit, juice, yogurt, even hot cocoa for the kids - and it's all kosher, as a bonus.So, like I said, this place is just so good that I would feel guilty not creating an account to give them a plug.

We chose to stay here because of the great Midtown East location, affordable price, and 4+ star rating on many sites. The location is superb but unfortunately, that's it. The rooms are tiny with incredibly small beds and uncomfortable pillows. The two elevators managing 18 floors of guests will always make you wait. The lobby is dated and sad...almost messy compared to the professionally decorated lobbies of other ""same in class"" hotels nearby. The complimentary continental breakfast is a unique touch; but it's truly everything you would expect from a 'free' continental breakfast (we went to Ess-a-Bagel across the street). In the future, we will certainly return to this neighborhood, but will not stay at the San Carlos again.","Williamsburg, Virginia","tstowler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Williamsburg, Virginia</strong>",2,2.0

We arrived early in the morning after an overnight flight from LA, tired and hungry. The check in time was 4 pm, but as we had big luggage with us, we decided to go and drop off our luggage at the hotel so we can go explore as soon as possible. We were greeted by Gabriel, a lovely older gentleman, that we learned throughout our stay, is the heart and soul of this hotel. To our surprise Gabriel told us that we didn't have to wait, our room was ready and he invited us to have breakfast in the dining room after we have freshened up. The breakfast was included with our stay and consisted of scrumptious freshly baked pastries and bagels, cereal, fruit, coffee, tea.The hotel is situated within a short walk to the Rockefeller Centre and Empire State Building. There are subway stations close by, but walking is so much more fun and you can see much more. The hotel room was clean and spacious and the hotel overall was presented really well, the only downside was the construction site next door. The work started early in the morning, but it didn't affect us, as we were getting up really early to have breakfast and be out exploring, as we only had 3 days in NY.We were a bit disappointed on the last day when we went down to have breakfast and because there was a Jewish holiday, the breakfast consisted of fruit and some super sweet pastries, which we couldn't eat. We were lucky to leave that day, as the entire week from then on the breakfast would have been the same.All in all this a great hotel. If we ever visit New York again, we will definitely stay here again. If you decide to stay at this hotel I hope you get to meet Gabriel.","Sydney, Australia","Corina C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",27,5.0

Luckily it didn't disturb us when brother used the bathroom in the middle of the night (that's maybe because of the good night sleep in the comfy bed).The hotel breakfast is really traditional; there's nothing really special. We skipped the breakfast few mornings because of the late sleep.

I booked this room via the hotels solicitation via Jetsetter/Secret Escapes on-line. I was very much looking forward to my stay at this hotel. My reservation was confirmed and I called the hotel directly as a courtesy to inform them that I had a registered and certified by a healthcare professional small, well-behaved support dog that I was bringing with me. I spoke to a manager at the hotel who assured me all was okay with my reservation. One week later I received an email stating that my reservation had been cancelled ""due to unavailability of rooms at the hotel"". I checked on-line at the hotel's website and it did show room availability for the dates I had booked, but at a much higher room rate price due to a busy event week in NYC. My room was cancelled most likely for mercenary reasons to get top dollar for the room - or for discrimination against my bringing a support animal. When I called the hotel directly they said it was an error made by Jetsetter/Secret Escapes for overbooking (even though the manager had confirmed my reservation when I called to let them know about my support dog). I then called Jetsetter/Secret Escapes and they said it was the hotel's fault and that they only book based on room availability given to them by the hotel. Very little to no remorse or understanding of the difficult situation I was placed in losing a full week at a busy time to find another accommodation in the area. It was unconscionable to automatically cancel my reservation that had been confirmed by both parties. Obviously the hotel does not care about their prospective guests.

There is a pharmacy-grocery store one block north by Lexington, I bought smoked ham and items to compliment the breakfast! Super nice hotel!!! I would stay again without a doubt!

Clearly an older building, but kept up to date and very clean. I was greeted warmly upon my arrival at 3:00 pm and was given a room immediately. My meeting was a half a block away, very convenient.

The breakfast items provided were fresh and adequate to start the day off with. It was a nice location in many respects. It was close to subways, shopping and restaurants. The walk to the theater district is at least a mile which is okay in daylight. However, it is unpleasant to walk back after an evening theater performance in which it is difficult to impossible to get a cab. One night we walked back in the rain the entire distance to the hotel unable to find a cab that wasn't already occupied. Generally, the hotel staff was helpful. But in the beginning no doorman was available to assist in transportation. We unwittingly got into a service car,in which the driver charged an exhorbitant rate. We came to appreciate the value of the presence of a good doorman following this experience. Some of the hotel desk clerks seemed preoccupied when we registered and asked a few questions. In retrospect,we feel they could have been more generous in providing information and traveler tips. My advice to anyone needing transportation is to stick with yellow cabs and the subways. Another traveler alert: The Blue Line subway was closed from Friday nights to Monday mornings due to construction and will be for months. This caused a need for taking cabs more often. I would still recommend this hotel because our overall experience was favorable.

Nice large counter, plenty of room to place your cosmetics and a separate mirror for makeup. Plenty of hot water and great water pressure in the shower. There was a small fridge ,microwave, coffee and small sink. However there is not a toaster. I rearranged the dishes in the cabinets to make storage room for our snacks. . Lots of closet space and hangers and 3 small drawers to store socks and other articles. Small safe held our I pad . There was an air conditioner in the bedroom and living area with separate thermostats. The air conditioners are on the wall under the windows which gives the room an odd look and makes the windows really small. However the air conditioners work very well and are quiet. I much prefer function over form. The bed was okay- we slept well after walking all over NYC each day. The mini bar was in the bedroom- and had a tray of snacks for purchase on top. I moved this tray to another area because I was afraid it would knock it off if I got up at night. Continental breakfast is included and was adequate. OJ, yogurt , apples, bananas, breads , coffee, tea ,and 2 non brand cereals available. Much better to go to Ess a Bagel for breakfast. The staff at the hotel is wonderful. They are friendly , polite and very very helpful. The concierge gave us great directions on where to catch the cross town bus (Lexington and 2nd ave. ). They have umbellas at the front door to borrow if it is raining. I was really impressed with housekeeping who were friendly and did a fantastic job. The hotel arranged a very nice car service at a reasonable rate to go back to the airport. Now for the bad- There is major major construction next door. It starts around 7 or 7:30am and went until about 6pm. You can hear this noise even on the opposite street( on 2nd Ave). We were lucky - there was no noise until Tues morning. If you are in NYC to sight see and plan to be up early and not back until after 6 pm this will not bother you. However, we like to sleep late and often take a rest in the afternoon before going out at night. If this had happened on Sat or Sun we would have changed hotels. I really love this hotel, and its location and staff are wonderful but the noise from construction ( which is not the hotel's fault.) is very disturbing.

The hotel is in the heart of Manhattan and you simply walk to Broadway in less than 8 minutes.We were told that many hotels in the area are offering a better discounted rate for Sloan Kettering Patients. However after many days of searching, we found out that Not only "" San Carlos Hotel's rate was lower than participated hotels, they offer more. They truly make you feel like home.

I would say that the room for breakfast is small, however their selection is good and as someone stated; you can take it back to your room. Good tasty pastries and coffee to start the day. I did this once as we didn't come to NYC for a continental breakfast. The noise didn't bother is once as they start at 8am and if you are up any later, you miss the day in NY. Due to the time difference, I found myself waking at 3am and going for a walk at 6am. There's a lovely walk towards the river and the city is already busy at this time. The room was great and everywhere was extremely clean. When we returned to the room, there had been a turn down service leaving chocolates. They have tea, coffee & microwave in the room along with an iron and board hidden in the cupboard. There a safe and mini bar but I would suggest looking at the mini bar prices before using it. The bed was great and we were told it was a king size, it was larger then our king size at home (everything here is larger). Very comfortable bed with a iPod docking alarm clock and an excellent range of film on the hotel tv. As everyone has said before, it's just a 10mjn walk to Times Square & Central Park. They will also hold your bags if your transfer is after checkout. Helpful tip, if you use your Debit Card here; press the Credit Card button on the machine or the transaction won't go through.

It is an even shorter walk (5 mins) to grand central station and Chrysler building. There are some great restaurants just 3-4 minutes down the road behind the hotel, such as The Smith and Dos Caminos Mexican, and a good breakfast restaurant called Morning star cafe, also a cafe opposite serving quick breakfast (bit like a greasy spoon, cheap and cheerful), if on some mornings/evenings you are too tired from sightseeing to go too far! There is a cafetière in the room to make coffee in the morning and hotel generous with refilling the coffee sachets to make a fresh pot or a couple of fresh pots a day, which is nice. Toiletries are given which are aveda, again, a nice touch. Only one negative but it wasn't really a negative for us, we only ventured to breakfast once at the free buffet and it was awful. Just sweet dry pastries, sugary cereal and yogurts didn't look appetising -just not to our taste. We ate out for breakfast other days or just bought some bread from the boulangerie and cheese/ fruit/yogurt from the supermarket down a couple of blocks, and had that in our kitchen as there is a fridge and cutlery and crockery so that's all great. I would highly recommend this as a base for travellers in NYC, it's well priced compared with others, spacious, clean, friendly, and has all the amenities you would need.

Its location on fiftieth street between Third Avenue and Lexington cannot be beat for its easy access to all the tourist locations in New York City. The best thing about the hotel is its loyal staff which constantly goes out of its way to be friendly and helpful. The same staff whom I first encountered ten years ago are still at the hotel which is indicative to why this hotel functions so smoothly. No words I can write could adequately explain how helpful the staff is other than to suggest you stay at the hotel yourself and be amazed by their friendliness, courteousness, and helpfulness. The hotel rooms themselves are significantly larger than the usual hotel room in Manhattan, gives very good heat in the winter and air conditioning in the summer. The rooms are spotless and the beds very comfortable. The maid service is incomparable. I have never seen a hotel staff be more prompt in cleaning the room each day. There is a fine breakfast offered each morning as part of your room rate consisting of bagels, juice, coffee, and dessert rolls.

The food there is always fresh and good and I can take out my coffee and whatever else to my room.In the many times I have stayed there, I never had a problem with a bill.In summary, I would say that this is a first class boutique-style hotel which specializes in personal service and recognizing its guests.

However, after management took several measures to make things right, we have changed our view. We are currently at the San Carlos - staying until the end of this week, and can say that without the swift and efficient action of the manager, Evelyn Toro, our earlier view of the place would have remained unhappy. She made it her personal mission to see that we were made comfortable and happy in new upgraded rooms. Her pleasant, apologetic and helpful approach is the only thing that calmed our annoyance. The San Carlos is lucky to have professional staff like Evelyn attending to their guests. She deserves a bonus for changing our minds to the extent that we will consider coming back to the San Carlos and even will recommend it to other people on TripAdvisor and other sites!! The issues: Leaky toilet, broken blinds, faulty shower head are things that happen without warning. Unclean rooms or grungy rooms are never acceptable, but a swift acting management makes all the difference in keeping the guests happy. The night manager - Canute and the Bellhop Roberto were also very helpful. On the whole - spacious rooms for a NYC hotel - suites are recommended - housekeeping may need better supervision to avoid things getting lax - Breakfast is OK - no cut fruit or hot food, but there are good breakfast places around the corner - good overall service - especially if Evelyn is on duty:-) Thank you for making sure our stay was pleasant!","Durham, North Carolina","Fran B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durham, North Carolina</strong>",22,4.0

The reviews I had read before staying at the hotel did not disappoint. Staff were extremely helpful and friendly, from our welcome at reception, to the front desk porters and housekeeping ladies. The hotel is so central to midtown and uptown attractions, and in a really nice area of NYC. Our junior suite had plenty of space for 2 adults and 2 children, there were two king sized beds and a pullout sofa bed. The kitchenette and small dining area were very useful for nights we were just too tired to go out. There are plenty of restaurants on E50th St.and around 2nd and 3rd Ave to suit all tastes and budgets. There is no bar in the hotel but plenty in the area. The complimentary continental breakfast in the hotel is basic, but it did the trick, as most places serve pastries and coffee for breakfast anyway. If you're looking for something more adventurous, like fresh green juices or a traditional hot breakfast, there is plenty of choice around. One morning we were there it started to rain. The hotel had umbrellas ready to suppy to guests who would need one. The hotel has wifi in its bedrooms. There is also a business centre which can be freely accessed by guests and has stronger wifi.

Just returned from another family trip and based on TripAdvisor reviews decided to try The San Carlos. Most big city hotel rooms are small so we like to stay in a ""junior suite"" or ""mini suite"" accommodation. In nyc, that's pricey, around $500/night when we stayed at the Marriott, Omni, and others in midtown. Found a great deal for $325/night at The San Carlos for their 600 sq ft. junior suite. I was nervous because I believe if it's too good to be true...... you know the rest. Well, everything was as advertised and as other reviewers have posted. At least this larger room was excellent. Didn't have some of the high end accents, but you would hardly notice. It was clean, bed was great, free basic continental breakfast. Other reviewers complain that there isn't much selection for breakfast, but it is your basics to grab and start the day. The staff couldn't have been more friendly and made us feel very welcomed. Dinner reservations, arranging car service... the big chains have nothing on this place except a bigger price tag. Location wise was still great...a couple blocks east of the other hotels we usually stay at, but still close to everything. Right next to the Waldorf Astoria. Take advantage of their lower prices while you can because the only reason they aren't as expensive as the others is lack of brand recognition, which is only a matter of time until the word is out.","Wellington, Florida","Dylaur</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wellington, Florida</strong>",53,5.0

From the time we arrived to when we checked out, each and every staff member was polite, helpful and went out of their way to make our experience a pleasant on.When checking out, I asked for a late check out as our flight was not leaving until 9pm that night. The gentleman at the desk (without my asking) granted us a 4pm time. Having stayed in NYC at this time of year for the past 20 years, that is totally is never the case.Upon our departure, our bellman arranged for us to get a car and driver used by the hotel. A great ride to the airport by a very nice man.As we entered the airport, my granddaughter realized her wallet dropped out of her pocket and was in that car.We called the hotel who in turn was able to contact the driver who returned to the airport, sought us out and gave my granddaughter her missing wallet with everything in tact.

Room was comfortable. We were quickly moved to a new room after we learned that the air conditioning in our first room was completely broken. We chose the hotel for two primary reasons: location, and because we didn't look closely enough at the advertisement in regard to ""in room"" ""kitchenette."" We had hoped for a burner. No such luck - just a refrigerator and a microwave. Not terrible, and their advertising was not deceptive. We simply misread, but it was not what we had expected. Breakfast was worth about $17 per day, by NYC standards: orange juice, coffee, and slightly below average pastries. The fitness center left much to be desired: Universal was broken, and the only other machines were treadmills (and I think one stair machine/climber). There was no restaurant in the hotel, but there were dozens of very good restaurants nearby.

That should say enough but I'm compelled to write more. I'm a hotel junkie - whenever I have a trip (often) I scour tirpadvisor, read the most recent review on the top 10% hotels and narrow it down from there. I think I'm pretty picky. Location, cleanliness, ammenities, room size, look and feel, etc. are all factored in. Ties are broken by price. Every year I review the NYC hotels and absolutely nothing comes close to what the San Carlos offers me. First of all, I feel very safe in the area and the hotel. I'm recognized by the staff that never seems to leave (another excellent sign) and treated with the utmost friendliness and courtesy. The rooms are HUGE and extremely clean. What's so remarkable is that they smell clean - not like the last guest OR deodorizer...just very clean. The breakfast, while continental, offers something for everyone, from hot chocolate to cottage cheese and fresh fruit. I've read other review about the hotel being a bit outdated and I can tell you, nothing is further from the truth. I visited this time with that in mind and just shook my head. The furniture is in pristine condition and luxury-modern, walls are clean and tastefully decorated...having been there so many consecutive years, I think I'd be a good judge of changes but it's as fresh as the first year I visited.The hotel is close enough to walk every where yet far enough away to be out of the crowds. It's a nice easy walk to Central Park, Times Square, Dylans Candy Bar, 5th Avenue shopping and a subway station.So once again, I give this hotel a 5 star rating.

However the room was sufficiently roomy, clean with a kitchenette (no cooker) and mini fridge which suited us to store our drinks and other food purchases. Our room on the 4th floor faced 50th St and apart from some early noise in the evening from the building works next door it was relatively quiet considering we faced the main street. The bathroom window was able to be opened which was good for fresh air. Wifi was good although you needed to log back in after a period of time. Over the 9 days of our stay it was nice to see the same staff (on a rotational basis) and they were helpful and friendly.Daily Continental breakfast included in rate (various mini rolls, breads, packaged yoghurt, apples and bananas, OJ, coffee and tea) was continually replenished, kudos to the lady and gentleman that were serving each day. The room could get full at times but it varied during the 7-10am timeframe.The hotel is in an excellent location - around the corner from the 6 Subway on 51st (straight downtown to Brooklyn Bridge & Chinatown or uptown to 86th and the MET) or the D-E on 53rd (to 5th, 7th, 42nd and 34th Ave).

The rooms were a nice size and very clean. Ours was on the back of the hotel, so we had a view of the building behind us but it was ok. It was enough to be able to look out and check the sky for weather. Unlike some other reviews, we did not find there was a lot of noise. Our room had a strong smell of Clorex when we arrived. Strong enough that when our bags were delivered, he suggested we call to have someone come and remove the pane of glass from our window which would allow us to open the window and ventilate the room. We took his advice and had to leave the window open for several hours. Unfortunately, there was no screen on the window. At one point I noticed a massive spider crawling along our ceiling!!!!!!!!!! We closed the window immediately. I did keep wondering if there were any other bugs or spiders that had gotten in, but eventually I relaxed. The staff were great! There is a man at the front desk that has a great way with children, he performed magic tricks for my kids and then disclosed his secrets before our week was up. Our last day there, one of the guys in the lobby went well out of his way to find us a cab. (Sorry I wish I knew his name)The free breakfast was sufficient. An assortment of breads, pastries, yogurt, cereal and fruit. I agree perhaps some sort of protein would be appreciated by some. The breakfast room was definitely a little crowded at times. Location wise? I loved it. Very close to many main attractions and subway stations, tons of restaurants nearby... Head over to 2nd Avenue and you'll discover endless restaurants.Unfortunately, we did have one incident that would probably keep me from returning. One day we returned to the hotel and discovered that our key card for the room was not working. We went to the front desk and the girl offered to make two new cards for us. Once we were on our way and in the elevator, my husband questioned the room number that I gave the front desk. He wasn't certain but thought I gave the wrong number, and I did!!!!!!! I gave her room 10-10 but we were staying in 10-06. I went back to the front desk and the young girl fixed it for me. But I have to say it was I very unsettled by the fact that someone could so easily gain access to a room that wasn't theirs. It's a major glitch in security in my mind.

The hotel is in the perfect location on E 50th street, between Lexington and 3rd. It's 5 minutes from a couple of stations. 15mins walk to Central Park, Bloomingdales, Macy's and Time Square, it's a great location. There are loads of diners and restaurants, banks and convenience stores around the hotel so you stock up on a few drinks and nibbles so as not to use the very expensive minibar drinks & snacks. The hotel itself is very nice. The lobby is not huge but it does the job. We had a very nice welcome from the staff who were very efficient and friendly. The room we had was an executive jr. suite which was a decent size and had a kitchen zone, a sitting zone and a bedroom area. It was plenty big enough for the 3 of us. The only complaint I would have is that there was no extra toilet/WC in the suite apart from the one in the bathroom. With 3 people it would have been much appreciated to have an additional WC as there are in other large suites in other 4* hotels I have stayed in. But that's a small issue. The cost was £350 per night including breakfast which was a good deal for 4* midtown NYC. The hotel was modern and clean and quite plush, although the decor in the rooms (see pics) was more traditional modern. I was happy with the standard. There is a gym on site and a breakfast restaurant. I can't comment on the room service food as we ate out at the many fantastic eateries in Mahattan. There is free wifi througout the hotel which is always handy. All the staff were really pleasant. There is no issue with noise. This is not the cheapest way to stay in Manhattan but if you want 4* quality accommodation and a central locale then IMO this is a reasonable price to pay in midtown Manhattan, approximately £115 per person per night is a cheap.... relatively.

Great place to stay. The hotel was in a brilliant location two minutes walk from St Patricks, Rockafella Centre, Radio City. The area is very safe to walk around late at night. The rooms are very clean and well equipped. We are a family of five, two adults and three teenagers and our room, which was a family suite, was fantastic. We had a big bathroom, bedroom with two queen sized beds and flat screen tv. Then we had a living area which was huge with queen sofa bed and two armchairs and another flat screen tv. This was great when the girls were so tried and went to bed and could watch their tv and me and my husband could sit in the living room with a bottle of wine and relax while watching something else. Then we had a kitchen area with sink and microwave, coffee machine and fridge. We also had some crockery and cutlery and a table and chairs too. We love our tea first thing but there was no kettle so just rang housekeeping and they sent one up so we could enjoy a cuppa in bed when we woke up. The only downside to this hotel was the view, or lack of it! Our rooms actually looked out to a brick wall! But to be fair we were only in the room to sleep. Also noise was not an issue as we have seen in other reviews. With the windows closed there was hardly any noise and we all got a great sleep, especially as the beds were so comfy. The hotel also provided a free continential breakfast which we went down for the first day. Its offered in a tiny room and it was very chaotic to say the least. Tea, coffee, juice, pastries and bagels were on offer. We didn't bother after the first day as not what we wanted. Just across the street from the hotel was a place called the New York Luncheonette, which we used most days for breakfast, very good. See my review for this. The hotel also has free fast Wifi. The staff at San Carlos were lovely, very friendly and helpful while we were there. Just to mention, we emailed the hotel before hand about airport transfers. We received a reply saying it would be $200.00 one way. Because of this we got two cabs from JFK which cost $58.00 for each cab to the hotel. When we were leaving, the hotel said they could do the airport run for $120.00 one way. They couldn't explain the earlier email. Not sure what that was all about. Decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and took up their offer for airport transfer. They arrived with a massive car which seated eight and had enough room for all our bags. Would definitely stay here again if back in NewYork.","London, United Kingdom","510christinew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",110,5.0

A little protein would have been nice, but it was complimentary, so I'm not that upset by it.

The staff was friendly and everything was clean and comfortable. We stayed in the junior executive suite, which had a King bed and a pull-out full (?) sofa. Since our boys are tall at ages 10 and 12, we requested a cot in addition, and that worked out very well to have the boys in separate beds. The executive suite is a great size, 410 sq ft, with a living area and separate kitchen and eating area... plenty of space for us all to spread out when we came back from sightseeing. It was good having free Wifi too, and the TV was a nice size. All so much better than a standard hotel room! Although we didn't use it much, there was a kitchenette with a coffee maker, fridge, sink and microwave. We used the fridge for storing some drinks and fruit, and there were dishes in the kitchen so you could have made a simple meal if needed. We enjoyed the free breakfast both days as it was great to get a quick bite and not have to worry about finding breakfast and spending a lot of time/money doing so. The breakfast is pretty good. They have 3 types of cereals, fresh apples, great OJ, coffee/tea/hot chocolate, an assortment of yogurts and pastries/bagels/toast. Our only complaint about breakfast is that the room is very small and congested. The staff needs to come in and out repeatedly to replenish all the items and they have to bypass the tables with people standing in their way as they tried to carry in big baskets of pastries. It was a little chaotic! The room needs to be bigger and there also weren't enough tables so people had to wait. The pastries and bagels are also not great quality....for a city that is known for its bagels, they could do a lot better! However, it's free and quick, so that was a big plus. As far as location is concerned, you would be hard pressed to do better! If you head toward 2nd avenue, there is a large variety of restaurants and a grocery store within a few blocks of the hotel. There is a small convenience store across the road from the hotel. The subway entrances are within a couple of blocks of the hotel, and of course the famous 5th avenue with all its great stores etc is a short walk. On our last day, we left our luggage and picked it up in the evening before departing. As we headed out in the morning, we were mentioning the incoming rainy weather, and the front desk staff offered us free umbrellas that they keep by the front door! They turned out to be very handy as it drizzled all day. Overall, we had a fabulous stay and thought the amenities, location and staff were all excellent. Combine that with a great rate that we found on the internet, and we would definitely stay here again!","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","Sue215G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",1,5.0

Rooms were always very well cleaned every day.On the 2nd floor is the business centre, was able to book trips and print out boarding passes right there.

All of the reception staff were always very friendly and pleasant.

Only strange thing...he asked if we took any water from the room.

Didn't think I needed to report to hotel what I took from mini-bar, assumed we would automatically be charged for these items (as my experience with other hotels). But that was my only negative on my stay there. If ever in NYC again I would definitely consider staying here again.

I perused the usual search engines and websites and all the 5 star and most 4star properties showed no availability. I then went on Priceline.com (which I usually never do because of not having control over where you end up staying) I requested a 4 star property with a max fee of $500. I was surprised that my criteria was accepted and I was set up with San Carlos Hotel. We arrived at the property at 10:30am. Someone very polite answered the phone and provided us with the room early (plus). When asked, he said there wasn't valet parking at the property and they have an ""arrangement"" with a public garage 3 1/2 blocks away for a $15 discount (from the usual fare of $45) Mind you, it was 16 degrees outside so this was a major disappointment that we had to park ourselves and walk close to 4 blocks in the midst of a frigid day. (minus) We checked in the room. The furniture looked like it was picked up from a Howard Johnson's going out of business garage sale. the decor was very depressing. I sat on one end of the bed and the other end of the bed propped up (minus)I went to the hotel manager right away and explained our situation to them. I explained that I had signed up for a 4 star property and even though everyone has been super nice (very true actually) the property is not even close to being 4 stars in terms of its facilities or amenities. I returned the room keys and found a last minute availability at the Plaza (review to come) I ended up losing the $500 I spent because of Priceline's policies. Let this serve notice that I think Priceline is a scam organization that takes advantage of non-standardized hotel ratings system and can get away with it. So, if travelers enjoy their experiences at this hotel, by all means they should acknowledge it on these review sites. HOWEVER, most often reviewers misrepresent their experiences by artificially elevating the star rating of the hotel (which is meant to represent the facility, amenities and service). Yes in my limited time of 30 minutes at this property, I could tell the staff had a super pleasing attitude.

Of special mention is The door attendant, who was especially friendly and helpful each time we passed him. If you can afford it, stay at this hotel. You won't be disappointed.

Travelling with two adult children I did my research beforehand looking for larger room ( not easy in NYC) included Wifi & breakfast. This hotel provided all along with decent location within walking distance off most places of interest. This was our second visit to the city, last time we stayed at Doubletree in Times Square. This is also a good suite hotel but this time we wanted to be away from the tourist madness. We booked the elite 1 bedroom suite which gave us a bedroom with two queen beds separate living area with sofa bed & kitchen area with fridge microwave & sink. The room was located on the 6th floor. The space was massive, breakfast ( served between 7 & 10am) although quite basic was sufficient to kick off our day. We ate in hotel 3 of 6 mornings there, the other days went across street to the New York Luncheonette which offered good hot options ( pancakes were yummy) we were able to walk to Times Square in 15 mins & found the area surrounding the hotel really nice, safe & with lots of choice of eating places. Never had any issues with wait times for lifts & although we didn't interact much with reception staff..preferring to do our own thing..they appeared friendly & approachable. It was very hot during our visit & air con although noisy worked efficiently. The only negative for us was noise. Although this is to be expected in centre of any city we felt soundproofing was not very good. We were woken in the early hours every night by bin lorries which came anytime between midnight & 5am. Some reviewers recommend rooms at rear of the hotel as being quieter potential visitors should be aware that there is a construction site adjacent to hotel where they commenced work at 8am. Not a problem for us as we were out most of the day but might be an issue if you like to sleep late.On a separate note we travelled to New York via Dublin with Aer Lingus & I would definately recommend this. American immigration is done here & 4 of us were processed within 10 minutes. It meant we were able to sail through JFK when we arrived & not have the usual frustrating 2/3 hours it has taken us in past visits.","Aberdeen, United Kingdom","anniem15</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aberdeen, United Kingdom</strong>",48,4.0

We ate at Sarabeth's Kitchen on Central Park South one morning which was good but not worth the $100 for the three of us.

We then used the metro cards for the rest of the week as it was so convenient to get from the hotel to all the sights via Subway.The room was great for a family of five with two double beds in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the living room (which was ultra easy to make up!). Wifi wasn't the fasted in the world but was very reliable and was never once unavailable. The breakfast room is fairly small but everything is set up to take away if necessary - coffee cups with lids and disposable plates.

We usually stay across the street at The Benjamin, but wanted to try a different hotel in the same area. Upon check-in, we were brought to our One Bedroom Suite and found it had two double beds that could not be pushed together. My confirmation (booked 2 months earlier DIRECTLY at the hotel website) specified the room type as ""One Bedroom Suite- Elite, One King or Queen Bed.) I called the front desk and asked to be changed into the correct room. However I was told that no suites with king beds were available and that the hotel does not guarantee bed size. This is contrary to the fact that they actually specify bed size in their room confirmation email. I went down to the front desk to ask for a manager and was referred to an ""assistant manager"" who told me the same thing. My response was that this was unacceptable to me and that I expected to be compensated, or moved to a different room. After disappearing for five minutes, the ""assistant manager"" came back and said very begrudgingly that he would put us in the penthouse suite for the night- but only since we were staying just that one night. He was not friendly or apologetic in the least. He sulked the entire time. Also to note is that there is no valet parking. You must park in the garage next door and tell them you are parking for your stay at the San Carlos hotel, or you could be turned away since they fill up quickly. If you stay more than 24 hours, you'll pay for an extra day at the discounted hotel rate, regardless of how many hours you're over. With the negative aspect of the trip out of the way, allow me to state the positive ones. The penthouse suite was beautiful! There are two of them on the top floor, and we had the smaller of the two. There was a dining room area, kitchenette, living room, and a separate bedroom. The other had a fireplace, but ours did not. Both rooms shared an outdoor terrace facing the Waldorf and the RCA building, with a table, chairs, etc. We were extremely lucky that it was an unusually warm day in December. So we got to enjoy this beautiful terrace in the midst of December in NYC! It made up for the original debacle with the reservation. I'm giving the hotel three stars solely due to the customer service I received at the front desk. The room I ended up in was beautiful and I would highly recommend it. However, you should be careful when making reservations and not assume that you'll get what's actually stated in your email confirmation. The one other positive to note is that the bellman, Michael, was the nicest, most helpful person I met at this hotel.",NY,"WineCPA1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NY</strong>",20,3.0

It was Easter weekend and the hotel was full, so breakfast was served in the Indian restaurant adjoining.The coffee was poor, orange juice was from a dubious looking orange plastic container, there were green apples and red apples, yogurts if you knew who to ask, Rice Krispies, presliced bread, bagels, croissants etc all served in the Indian restaurant on plastic plates with plastic cutlery and paper cups. The lighting and music were poor and service nowhere near as attentive and friendly as the staff in the main hotel. We resorted to going out and finding our own breakfasts after 3 days of this, only to find that on the last day the hotels breakfast area was open and serving breakfast.

The bathrooms often tell the tale in hotels, and this bathroom tells a good one! The granite vanity was large enough for cosmetics, etc.--and the whole bath was clean, clean.

We were a little leery about this location because we had read how ""corporate"" it was. We actually loved the location--close to subways and with many restaurants within a short walking distance.

The first impression of the hotel was the warmth and friendliness of the staff, from the bell hop to front desk! Check in quick and easy. Walking distance to Rockefeller plaza, subway and more. The maid service was wonderful and the hotel (not just our room) was impeccably clean at all times. there were a couple of times when we requested extra soap or towels, within 3-4 minutes of calling down to front desk, we had what we requested. The rooms are a bit larger than a standard hotel room and two queen beds makingit feel a little more roomy. Fridge and microwave in room and everything in good working order and very clean. Breakfast was continental and included mostly breads, and breakfast pastries, cereals, apple or bananas and yogurt. Also bagels on just a couple of days, simple and quick breakfast option. My favorite was the hot milk in the carafe each morning. I put a lot of milk in my coffee and tea and most hotels only have the chilled milk for cereals, not hot milk so this was a pleasant bonus. A couple of days the breakfast room was full, but you didnt have to wait more than a few minutes for a table we usually got there befor 8 and no wait, but after 8:30-9, it got very busy. There is also a nice breakfast diner directly across the hotel, but it is a bit pricey as is most everything in the city! But convenient if you want to have eggs or pancakes or more substantial breakfast. Did I mention how nice and courteous the staff were? The Aveda shampoo and conditioner were sooo nice and shower was very hot and wonderful in the cold weather. The hotel car service is convenient and prompt in picking up and dropping at airport.

Stayed for five nights the week before Christmas in one of the one bedroom suites--which was larger than most New York apts. The small kitchen actually had usable utensils, plates and wine glasses with a small refrigerator. The bed was comfortable and the bathrooms well appointed. The free breakfast was not extensive but had juice, yogurt, fruit, coffee and breads. If you wanted someplace more there was a great diner across the street. The lobby is well appointed and there is a nice, free, business center. The staff were all friendly and helpful. The only downside, and the reason I did not give a ""five"" was because the in room wifi was totally unreliable. You could get a signal only about half the time and even then you would get bumped off. I had work I needed to do and I lost quite a bit one night because the wifi went down. The signals from the surrounding hotels were much stronger and always available (if of course you had the access code which you don't). The front desk didn't do anything or seem concerned when I twice raised the issue.The location is perfect. Easy walking distance to everything but off the main drags so you don't have the noise etc. There is a subway station a block away and it's only about 4 blocks to Grand Central. There are a number of close by restaurants ranging from a diner to high end--including several with takeout. There is a Duane Reade around the corner and a Starbucks a block away. I will definitely stay here again--as long as I can figure out a different option for wifi.","Portland, Oregon","murphykds</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",110,4.0

This sixteen floor hotel is located strategically at East 50th street between Third and Lexington Avenues, so conveniently situated close to the many wonderful tourist sites and stores that New York City has to offer. The greatest thing this hotel offers is service. The staff goes out of its way to fulfill the every want of its guests wherever possible. It all starts with the friendly and efficient bellboys and the magnificent staff at the registration desk who never fail to greet the customer effusively and are glad to oblige whenever their assistance is needed. Repeat guests are always recognized because there is rarely any turnover of staff at this hotel and the staff is amazingly able to recognize return guests, often even remembering the guests name even a year later. The rooms are very spacious (I always choose the room with two queen beds), offers great heat in the winter and superb air conditioning in the summer, has fine bathroom amenities including (thank goodness) more than enough towels, and very comfortable beds. The rooms are spotlessly clean and the maids very quickly clean the rooms so you can return to your room at any time of the day you choose and the beds will be remade and the bathroom supplies replenished. On the floor above the lobby there are six computers for your free use (wi-fi is also free) and these computers are always very well maintained. Free breakfast is also supplied to guests (continental type breakfast with bread, rolls, fruit, coffee, tea, juice, and yogurt available). While the view from some rooms is not spectacular you will never notice for you will be bowled over by the friendliness of the staff. I am perhaps a little reluctant to write this great review for fear that every Tom, Dick, and Harry will learn this best kept secret in New York and some day I will find it difficult to obtain a reservation when I want but all kidding aside, this is a magnificent place to stay whether you are in New York on business or for pleasure.","Hallandale Beach, Florida","philipmillermd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hallandale Beach, Florida</strong>",194,5.0

The bell hop was out in the road attempting to hail a cab. They all wanted airport runs and we were just going to the theater. He snagged a town car and negotiated a reduced price for us. Beyond the call of duty I would say. Every time we came in and out we were greeted warmly, with a sincere desire to help out in any way they could.Great location A couple of blocks from major subway lines, around the corner from a bus line. Away from the mania of Times square, and yet accessible to wherever you want to go.Fabulous suites We splurged on a two queen bed suite. The bedroom was roomy by NYC standards, with space to move around. There were three of us, and we had two closets to hang things, as well as drawers. (in the interest of clarity, we all could not have unpacked our suitcases into drawers, but there was a very generous number of ""normal"" hangers, not the secure ones that are such a pain to get in and out.) Loved having the sitting area and small kitchenette. We were out and about, didn't spend a lot of time in the room, but if we had had bad weather we would have been very comfortable inside. Our bathroom felt spacious, with room for the three of us to spread our stuff out. We enjoyed having a window in the shower to open for fresh air, but the fan seemed to take care of steam needs. The room was very quiet, and even the air conditioner noise was not a bother. I really enjoyed the bed, with a variety of coverings, to fit the warmth needs of any guest. I truly look forward to using the San Carlos Hotel in the future, whenever I have the pleasure of visiting NYC. An added tip, if you plan to use the bus/subway system I strongly recommend getting the $30/7 day pass. You get unlimited rides.

The m50 crosstown bus left on the San Carlos' block corner and took us straight to the Intrepid museum. Room was huge! Separate bedroom, two closet spaces, a small kitchen with enough cutlery/appliances to tide you over each day.Breakfast was well stocked and good quality (eg. Pastries looked appetising/apples weren't damaged unlike some places we have stayed). Members of our family often missed breakfast due to ill health/jet lag, and it was nice that staff were happy for me to take breakfast for them back to our room.Wi fi was good, no problems with speed or dropping out. Also liked the free newspapers.Premises were very clean and staff were lovely.We requested a quiet room and that's what we got. A whisper quiet room on level 16 facing away from the street, we didn't hear any other guests.The less good?As previous posters have mentioned, the AC is loud and the box is big. The size of the machine doesn't matter (aesthetics aside), but we did find it too noisy in our bedroom at night but having two rooms, we just left the door open, turned the AC off in the bedroom and cranked the living room AC up a little to compensate.Again as previous posters have said, the curtains are not block out. Our 2 year old was exhausted and lacking in sleep, but still woke up at the crack of dawn because of light in our room.A email before we arrived asking a question was never responded to, this is very poor customer service but is in stark contrast to all the staff we encountered once we arrived.Overall though, we really enjoyed our stay. the san carlos is not trendy but it's very clean, comfortable and and it felt like leaving an old friend when we left.",Sydney,"ajax79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",32,4.0

In New York City.Oy vey.In doing my research before our trip, I probably spent more time in hotel research than anything else. There’s SO many things to consider when choosing a hotel – such as location, price, size, quality, etc – and this is especially true when choosing a hotel in Manhattan.Take location, for instance…do you want to stay in the heart of Times Square? That’s great if you want to be within walking distance of a lot of the “touristy” stuff – but it could be horrible when it comes to noise…or cost. So – if having a quiet, peaceful night’s sleep is important to you – you may choose to NOT be in the heart of Times Square.So…I researched. And researched. And researched again. I like my sleep. I like peace and quiet. I also like space – and we had three people to fit into a room. A lot of hotel rooms in Manhattan are about the size of a person’s closet – so this was disconcerting to someone who is a bit claustrophobic. I finally discovered the San Carlos Hotel – located at 150 East 50th Street…in the Midtown East location in Manhattan. Tripadvisor.com had it ranked #32 out of 435 hotels in New York City – which is pretty darn good. As far as location, it was excellent…it was one block away from a subway line, and it was just a few blocks away from Times Square and Broadway. However – it was FAR enough away to afford us a bit of peace and quiet when we retired for the night. We were in Room #701 - a corner suite - that was high enough to give us some cushion from street noise. The price…was adequate. It wasn’t the cheapest – nor the most expensive – but for what we got (a suite), it was reasonable. Speaking of a suite, we had plenty of space. We had a small kitchen area, a dining table with two chairs, a pull-out sofa bed that Daughter used, and two good-sized closets. And quality? Wow. It was always clean; the concierge and doorman were always attentive; we had turn-down service every night (including chocolates on our pillows); free internet; and free continental breakfast. On a rainy day, the staff kindly lent us each an umbrella to use throughout the day - which was very much appreciated. Again, the staff were always attentive and helpful. On our last morning, we weren't getting picked up until 1:00 pm, and management kindly let us stay in our room until our car arrived.I will recommend this hotel to any family and friends who are visiting Manhattan, and will be sure to use it again myself when visiting.

The front desk staff were quite friendly, helpful, and made us feel like VIP's. They chatted with us about where we were from, what we planned to do, and offered advice on exploring the city. What a wonderful 'first impression' of the City!The room was nice and clean, with a microwave, coffee maker, mini fridge, and place settings for 2. The beds were luxurious.The room was on the 5th floor with an alley view but this was small price to pay for the luxury of not hearing traffic noise at night. After all, we spent very little time in our room awake. The complimentary breakfast was very much appreciated. The staff greeted us each time we left and returned to the hotel. Since this was our first time in NYC we relied on the staff to help us plan our mode of transportation; subway, taxi or walking; depending an the day's activity.On our last day, our flight wasn't until 5:45. We went ahead and checked out around 10 AM. The staff stored our suitcases while we did our last exploration of the city and suggested using a car service to the airport for little more than a taxi would cost. This removed the task of hailing a taxi, provided a much nicer ride to the airport, and guaranteed we leave the hotel on time and arrive at the airport on time.We will definitely stay at the San Carlos hotel on future visits to the Big Apple.","Fleming Island, Florida","telogiatrisha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fleming Island, Florida</strong>",0,5.0

What I love is the clean rooms, the attentive and friendly staff, the location, the price and the simple yet ample breakfast choices.Room cleanliness & housekeeping staff: it's rare for a room to not only appear AND be so clean but they must use some special deodorizer because the entire hotel smells fresh yet not overly perfumed - just clean. The towels are thick and luxurious, the bedding is crisp and the bath amenities are Aveda. Even if we didn't need more products, they housekeeping staff stocked us new each day. When we needed extra pillows or towels they were at our door within minutes.Lobby staff: forever and always friendly. We ran into the owner in the breakfast room and he was incredibly gracious and friendly as are the bellhops and front desk staff. Speaking of the breakfast room, there's an assortment of bread items such as pastries and bagels as well as a toaster. Good coffee, hot chocolate, hot milk, juice and teas. There's cold cereal and a fresh fruit every day. What I really love is the cottage cheese and yogurt assortment for those of us who don't want bread for breakfast.Location: why go to NYC if you don't plan on walking? We love where this hotel is - very close yet far enough to Central Park and Times Square. We even take a day to venture by foot to Chinatown, Soho and the village. Very easy and pleasant walk not to mention the area itself is about the safest place I've ever been. We're comfortable walking outside at night to get a bite or do some more shopping.Décor & room: the hotel is luxuriously decorated without being gaudy or old-vintage. The rooms are incredibly large for NYC standards. I always take one of my children with me along with my business partner and there's plenty of room. The staff is VERY welcoming to children, too.

There were no bacon or eggs, but that was for us no matter.The position of San Carlos Hotel is very good, just few steps from the metro station and bus stops. 5 minutes walk and you get to the Rockfeller Center and 10 minutes walk you get to MOMA museum.We would choose this Hotel again, no doubts.",Italy,"lunamonda</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Italy</strong>",48,5.0

Checking in was efficient and the room on the 8th floor was spacious with 2 comfortable and clean double beds,(pillows nice and soft). The bathroom was also clean and the shower hot and powerful. There was a TV, coffee/tea making facilities, mini-bar, fridge and free safe – WI-FI was also free. The batteries needed changing in the TV remote and we couldn’t re-open the safe, but this was resolved within minutes - fantastic service. Breakfast in the dining room included a variety of breads, bagels, cakes, cereals, yoghurts, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and orange juice. Extra appreciative touches included free newspaper in the morning and a square of chocolate on the bed at night. Free use of computers and printer on the 2nd floor was a bonus. What can I say about the staff – amazing: helpful, knowledgeable and really pleasant – they couldn’t do enough for us, especially on the last day when we left our suitcases all day – at no extra charge (some hotels apparently charge)! The position of the hotel was within walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Times Square, 5th Avenue, Grand Central Station and Central Park (where we enjoyed a glass of wine, soaking up the sun). My only advice would be to take a good map (street signs to attractions are not very good) and a pair of really comfortable walking shoes - together with a can of muscle spray (for the end of the day)!! Also pre-print timed tickets to visit Ground Zero – the queues are very long and ticket holders go in first! The queues to buy tickets to see a Broadway show were also quite long, but once the ticket booths had opened at 3.00 pm, it was quite quick to book tickets. We went to see ‘Nice Work if you can get it’ which was a Gershwin musical comedy (very enjoyable). You can buy tickets for Hop-on, Hop-off bus tours, which take you to the main attractions and there’s also an underground sub-way. There are cafes and restaurants near the hotel (differing in price), as well as bars, although wine seems to be quite expensive. The only negative comment I have of the hotel is the view of another tall brick building from our hotel room, but it didn’t spoil our stay, as we were out all day every day. Also be aware that additional taxes are added on to the hotel bill (14.75% tax and 10.5% City Tax) – otherwise an amazing hotel, visit and experience.","Sheffield, United Kingdom","margaret_swift10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sheffield, United Kingdom</strong>",43,5.0

A Metro Station only one block away and one block from the Tour Buses route which went to Times Square and Ground Zero. There are many restaurants in the area which is safe at night and never felt uncomfortable.We did use the Open Top Tour Buses and went on most routes, a fairly fast way to see most areas. We bought our tickets in advance online which may not have been the best idea. Having talked to some of the many Ticket Touts they have room to bargain and give you 4 day passes for the price of 2 days, you also don't have to queue at Madame Tussauds for an hour for your tickets.Be careful in New York, as with all big cities you need to watch your belongings, one of my party lost her purse, pick pocketed on the Staton Island Ferry, which is free by the way and passes close to Liberty Statue.

Any noise we did hear were from other guests in the adjoining room. The complimentary wifi was superb. Those who dont bring their own laptop can access the 3 pcs and printer in on the first floor. The hall ways look like there had been re carpeted recently.The location of the hotel was fantastic nice safe neighbourhood with absolutely everything on your door step and easy walk to Time Square, 5th Avenue and we walked back to our hotel from Central Park after the New Year Celebrations. Lots of shops on lexington and close to Bloomingdales and main subway lines. Many people have criticised the breakfast - well sorry I am afraid your really can't complain it is included in the room rate and provides the basics to get you going in the morning (juice, tea, coffee, hot choc, pastries, cheese, bagel, yoghurt, fruit). The hotel between Christmas and New Year as you would expect was full and this did prove a little challenging in the dining room. Guests (including us) took their breakfast back to their suite which worked out fine - the only feedback for the hotel here is provide some trays for use by guest carrying hot liquids. Another tip - there is an indian bar / restaurant next door (actually joined onto the hotel), They do great happy hour - well 3 hrs! try it, it was just fine after a day of sightseeing. We got a take away one night and took it back to our room also ok, this can be delivered also. (see my separate review)The doormen we polite and helpful and gave you an umbrella for the rainy day we had They organised a hotel car to take us back to the airport and it was swift and reasonably priced. All in all an extremely comfortable, family friendly, couple of business hotel would suit all. In a safe located close to everything. Will definitely return here.

There is nothing wrong with rooms, cleanliness, breakfast is adequate even with plastic plates and cutlery, porters are extremely helpful. It is not the cheapest and for the price, I think they had opportunities to do better and didn't. I booked through Booking.com and emailed a few days before arrival just to confirm all was ok. There followed a few emails looking for my credit card details on an unsecure email as booking.com did not appear to have sent them. If that was the case, this should have been taken up with them. I also requested a front facing room - we got a back facing one with no explanation. I had also pointed out it was a 20 year surprise wedding anniversary holiday for my family. EXCELLENT hotels would have handled the booking better, said to me that the requested room was not available and, for the price we paid, a SMALL acknowledgement of the occasion would have been made- it wasn't mentioned. There is nothing wrong with the hotel - our experience was fine but we paid alot of money for our stay. They had chances to shine and didn't. Would we stay again? Possibly, but in a big city like NY, there must be places trying harder to do everything they can for their guests.

The San Carlos is family owned and we even met the friendly owner himself in the lobby one morning. He went out of his way to ask if we were comfortable and well-cared for at his hotel, and then he gave us some of his personal sightseeing tips. We had a suite with a king size bed and sitting area with fold-out sofa where the kids (ages 10 and 12) slept well, and a small kitchen area. The room was extremely clean, quiet and the A/C worked well -- very much appreciated after long, hot days of summer sightseeing on the streets of NYC. I also really appreciated the computers and printers on the second floor. Use these to book and print advance tickets to the major attractions like the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, and skip the lines. The location was close to several subway stations and an easy walk to Rockefellar Center. The breakfast was OK, nothing to write home about, but the kids liked it and filled up. There were many other choices near the hotel for a quick bite to eat so the breakfast quality didn't concern me. I definitely wouldn't let it affect your choice to stay here, nor will it stop me from booking a room here next time we're in NYC.

We are a family of 4 and we stayed in 2 rooms. For the price you pay, the room is a good size and the location is good. You can take the subway from the left of the hotel or right of the hotel. But there are 2 major cons:- Breakfast buffet - we were shocked by how mediocre the buffet was. Soggy looking pastries that looked old, cereal from packets ... sorry, we ate out after that every single day and did not bother with the buffet. For NYC, i would expect better food but then again, for the price we paid, perhaps that is what was served. - My husband came to join us in NYC after 2 days and i had to book an extra room for him. I spoke to Canute at the front desk and he was really really confused about making a reservation. I spent 30 mins in front of him at the front desk on the 2nd night just to book for 1 more extra room (what was so tough about that) and he lost his temper at me. He asked me why we have to confuse things and not book in the beginning. WELL, IF I KNEW THEN THAT WE NEED AN EXTRA ROOM, WE WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY BOOKED ONLINE INSTEAD OF DEALING WITH YOU!! He definitely could not handle being on his own on the night shift and was very frantic, confused and kept messing the dates up himself.

I can say that we were very happy with our choice to stay here, and after staying in other hotels on different trips, this is the only one we would come back to. It isn't a fancy hotel with a huge lobby or restaurants, etc., but the location can't be beat and the room was huge. We had a suite with two queen beds in the bedroom and a pullout sofa. It was by far the largest room I have ever stayed in while visiting NYC. It was perfect for four women to spread out and relax after long days walking the city. We had a very quiet room, and didn't hear any street noise, and although there wasn't much of a view, we didn't really care about that. The beds were a tiny bit hard for me, and the sofa bed was a little thin (to be expected), but some really nice housekeepers brought a mattress topper for that which definitely helped. All of the employees were so friendly and helpful. The breakfast was fine - nothing special and not much of a selection, but it's free, and we weren't picky. We did eat at Ess-A-Bagel around the corner one morning.The location was excellent for our needs. We had a first-time NYC visitor with us, so we wanted to do some of then normal touristy stuff, and this hotel was within easy walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music Hall, 5th Avenue shopping, etc. We used the subway for anything that wasn't in walking distance, and the E train is literally one block away (I used the Embark NYC app to navigate the subway). The hotel staff were helpful in confirming directions and helping us get to where we needed to go if we had questions. We have stayed near Penn Station before and near Times Square, but we preferred this location as it is not nearly as crowded, although there aren't really as many restaurants or shops to choose from right outside of the hotel (or at least we didn't find them!). Overall, I would recommend this hotel. If you don't care about bars and restaurants right in your hotel, and if you are looking for a clean, affordable (for NYC!), comfortable, convenient, relaxing place to stay while you enjoy the city, this is a fantastic option.

Overall, the stay was completely hassle-free. I travelled with two friends, staying in a room with a sofa bed in the separate living room. We found the whole property very clean and staff generally friendly (happy to suggest bars - very good ones, at that). Things to note:- Sofa beds are perfectly adequate, but don't expect superior comfort. I was told that the bed provided very good sleep quality however. Sofa beds may be better suited for families with children. Also note that once the sofa bed has been set up as a bed, morning room service will not convert it back into a sofa unless you request it. Since they have evening turndown service, I found this a little surprising.- Breakfast is included, which in itself is rare for NY. It's not spectacular (neither is the breakfast room) but what they do provide is good quality, and it does give you a good start of the day.- Location. Now for us, hell on earth would be living on Times Square and we much prefer this slightly more quiet East Midtown location. There are a number of brilliant wine bars nearby with a more local clientele, and you can still walk to most places. Thumbs up. Overall, this is a very good place to stay.

There were 2 separate rooms, one with a king bed and one with a sofa bed. The sofa bed was a queen bed, so it was big enough to fit two people, but for our convenience, they brought in an extra roll-in bed for us. One of the best things about this hotel was that its room service almost immediately brought you whatever you wanted. For example, I asked for more towels and shampoo before I showered, and they delivered them in less than two minutes. The breakfast was rather simple, but the quality was still good. Sometimes it got so crowded that you had to wait in a line to get in. The breakwast was also light, hence the name ""continental breakfast,"" with a wide variety of pastries, breads, yogurts, etc. The hotel's location was very good, right next to the Waldorf Astoria and a short walk to Saks Fifth Avenue. One negative of this hotel was that the dining portion of the room service was not 24/7, and it was only Indian food. The staff was also extremely kind and welcoming.

My husband I took our sons, age 3 and 1, to NYC for a weekend trip. We truly enjoyed the hotel from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. There are three main reason why we love it, the room size, hotel amenity and the most important part, staff. My husband and I had stayed in several other hotels in the area in the past, (Affinia, Waldorf Astoria, Hilton New York and Hilton Time Square), but we found this hotel worth returning to. First of all, the size of the room is beyond expected. It felt more like a ""home"" than a hotel room. For the average price of a mid-town Manhattan hotel, we had a true one-bedroom suite with two queen size beds. The bed room was equipped with a standard size desk and a large flat screen TV. The beds were soft yet supportive. The living room had a sofa bed, two chairs, a large TV, a dining area and a kitchenette. After sitting in the stroller all afternoon waiting for us, my boys were ready for some stretching. The room provided plenty of space for them. If there is any downside to the room, that would be the view out of the window. We didn't care, since we spent most of the time exploring the city. The amenities of the room were great, especially the kitchenette. It has a small refrigerator, sink, microwave, and some basic dinnerware like bowls, plates, glasses and silverware. Don't worry about bringing a cork opener, they got that, too. We brought in dinner for Sat. night, and all the items in the kitchenette made it so much easier. The breakfast was simply, yet every item was delicious. Even coffee was better than Starbucks! Finally, and most importantly, I truly enjoy the people that work at San Carlos. The front desk staff were very helpful and paid special attention to each guest. The captain was very accommodating to our requests. The house keeping staff were very friendly. We truly felt welcomed at the hotel. On Sunday morning, my 3-year-old didn't want to go home and wanted to stay in NYC. The whole family found this experience beyond our expectations.

Housekeeping is efficient. Free internet access, I could use two devices simultaneously under the same login. No room service.The suite is large is disposes of kitchenette with microwave and fridge, although a toaster would have come in handy. It is quite comfortable for two people, with plenty of drawers and storing space, sofa and a small dining table with two chairs. Beware of the touch-sensitive mini-bar, unless you really want to pick up something. There are 2 large flat screen TV sets, but the program grid is limited to US channels: no French, German or Italian channel, which could add an international flair to the property. The bathroom has magnifying mirror, towels of good standard, satisfactory but not high-end toiletries. Bed is comfortable, there is a good choice of pillows, but sleep quality was greatly disturbed by persistent air-borne noise. The windows are definitely not soundproof (the site call them ""double-glazed""), and every kind of street noise seemed to pour into the room, from shouts and whistles late at night, to police and fire sirens all night long and delivery trucks early in the morning.Breakfast was better than I had expected from previous reviews. It is the usual continental type, and one would not pay less than 13 euros for it in a Parisian hotel; we would complement it upstairs with some fresh fruit bought the evening before. The breakfast room is really cramped, although that is a minor problem if you are on vacation and can manage your time schedule avoiding breakfast at peak times.The San Carlos is a nice and affordable hotel in NY, adequate for a short stay and particularly suited for families with children.","Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Gabriel C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</strong>",31,4.0

I'm sure our stay would have been great somewhere else as well, but I'm sure it would not have been as personal. When we left they told us not to leave as they had enjoyed our stay sooo much.

I was very disappointed and it wasn't like this the last time I stayed at the hotel. Plastic disposable cutlery and plates are not what I expected for a self-described 'boutique hotel'. Plastic picnicware is not something I have ever seen at hotels (maybe hostels?). It's also environmentally very unfriendly! Bins full of plastic plates, cups, knives and forks.

It had been a few years since our last stay and apparently it had become more popular since then because of all the good reviews. I guess it is a hidden gem no more! My grown daughters say that they will stay no where else when they are in New York City. Once again, the San Carlos did not disappoint.When we arrived, Gabriel (I think-no name tags) at the desk immediately greeted us with humor. Since it was my husband with me and our two daughters, he referred to my husband as ""Charlie"" the entire time and we were the ""angels"". We had booked a standard two queen bed room but Gabriel said that we were in a king room suite with a small kitchen at the same rate. I asked about the bed situation and he said that if my daughters were unhappy with the sofabed that we could switch. He assured them that the matresses were new and comfortable. Our suite was very spacious and we loved the kitchen area. We seemed to be facing out to a street but it was very quiet in our room. Besides the kitchen space, we had a little table and chairs area, two closets, a desk, two comfortable cushy chairs and a big screen TV plus the king bed! So nice for NYC. And my daughters never had a single complaint about the sofabed. I always especially like the real plants in the room and the roman shades. It seems to give such a homey touch. The bathroom was also spacious with robes, toiletries, plenty of towels and a makeup mirror, etc. We couldn't think of anything they didn't provide. Everyone as usual was very pleasant and friendly, always greeting us when we came and went. My husband was especially pleased with how quick the bellman got our luggage up to our room-even before we left the front desk. He had to track him down to give him his tip. We saw the umbrellas lined up as usual on a rainy day but we had our own. Everyone always provided help with our questions when asked. My husband enjoys the fact that he can set up transportation to and from the airport through the San Carlos before our trip. I love the scale in the lobby to weigh your suitcases before your flight-which they do for you if you want! I travel a lot and don't see a scale very often in a hotel lobby. A nice touch since I always want to know what mine weigh before I get to the airport.We love the San Carlos for its amenities and spaciousness but also for its location to 5th Ave. (a few blocks walk straight up) and the subway lines (right on the corner). We also found a great Mexican restaurant on the next block behind the hotel. Yes, the breakfast is a little lacking in variety but that doesn't bother us because we are getting FREE breakfast in NYC!!When we left, Gabriel joked with us once more and gave us free pens to take. We noticed a small boy coming in after us and he immediately started to show him a magic trick. We had to laugh! The San Carlos always makes us feel welcome and like we are part of the family returning for a visit.

The room is huge and has a mini kitchenette too. Super clean and comfortable. Parking is self park right next door with a discounted rate of $30 per night-even with our SUV! The gym is small but did the trick and there is a Starbucks less then a 5 minute walk away! The free continental breakfast is simple but did the trick. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We had brunch at Madison Restaurant after we arrived-a huge diner that was delicious and the wait staff very nice. We got cupcakes at Buttercup Bakery on the way back to the hotel. We saw Cirque du Soleil our first night and ordered a pizza and salad from Albitino's which is a 5 minute walk. Our last night there we ate at Chop A Steakhouse (a 10 minute walk) and took advantage of their Restaurant Week menu. A fabulous experience.During check out the manager did a magic trick for my daughter! I have stayed at the Affinia chain and much prefer this hotel for traveling with teens/tweens. There is no restaurant or bar so if you're looking for the trendy/nightlife scene this is not for you. My husband and I have stayed at the W right around the corner and I would go there if you are looking for that vibe.

It was quite clean and had good space, a nice sized closet, including a nook with a fridge for my own groceries as well as a mini bar. The bed was comfortable. A clock radio that will charge your iphone with plenty of plugs to recharge your electronics. I liked my room quite a bit. The front desk staff was kind and very helpful. They allowed me to check in early, and store my luggage on the day of departure. The doormen did a wonderful job helping with taxis and offering advice. However, they can not overcome everything.I had 2 significant problems during my stay. One was the noise in the hotel. Two was the lack of any civilized dining, as well as no room service at all.The doors in the hotel slam. So between rowdy guests coming and going at all hours and the morning housekeeping staff hollering down the halls, sleeping at 10 pm or 8 am was just not possible. The walls are thin and I could hear the televisions of neighboring rooms. Believe me, I am accustomed to NYC noise and not much gets to me. The noise at the San Carlos was just overwhelming, not just annoying. I was there 5 nights, and guests cam and went, but the noise level did not change. Such a disappointment.However, the thing I hated more was the breakfast service in a cramped dark hot room. Breakfast, which was limited to bad bagels, toast, a couple of varieties of cereal and coffee was a chaotic mess. Tiny paper plates, cheap plastic knives that break, and tiny coffee cups that are too hot to carry was a horrible way to begin my day. Everything was disposable and unpleasant. Honestly, the airlines do better. I stayed there five days and not one morning could I easily grab a cup of coffee and take a seat. Just a mess. Don't even think about requesting a coffee service to be delivered to your room either. Other midtown hotels have self serve breakfast, and it works. The key is space, good variety, and enough staff to keep the place clean, well stocked, and to provide assistance. Actual glassware, plates, and utensils would be nice. This just is the worst.The San Carlos has the potential to be a good hotel. I wish I wanted to return. I wanted to like it very much.

With so many choices, it should be easy to find a myriad of properties that suit any number of requirements. But for me, it was a struggle to find the perfect location, level of amenities, and acceptable price point for a recent 4-day trip w/ my hubby. I ruled out the overpriced hipster boutiques, the stuffy landmarks, the dinosaur properties, the tourist-laden chains, and the too-good-to-be true rates in less desirable parts of town. After that, I wasn't left with nearly as many options as you'd think.Then I found the listing for the San Carlos. I loved that they're one of the very last independently owned hotels in NYC, catered to a European clientele (which usually means non-fussy rooms, immaculately clean spaces, and competent staff), and the Manhattan East location; the area was convenient to RCMH where we were seeing 2 nights of concerts. The fact the rooms looked large vs the price and came w/ mini fridges and microwaves (somewhat unusual for Manhattan) sealed the deal. But looking good on paper doesn't mean in reality it will pan out.I'd made my reservation months in advance, over the phone, for a certain room type that the young lady I spoke to had 100% guaranteed. When I called week-of to confirm my reservation, I was told there was a possibility I might not be able to get the room type I'd been promised. Irked, I referenced the original reservation but they explained sometimes these things happen. True, but I hung up the phone and considered rebooking elsewhere; the phone rang back moments later and the young lady I originally spoke to apologized, said they would upgrade me at no fee and get me what I needed no matter what, and really acted as if she valued my business. I'd expect this from a 5 star property, but at a under $300 a night spot, it was refreshing. Customer service is a dying art. The staff at the San Carlos is old school, in the best possible, most refreshing way. Upon arrival, an easy cab ride from Penn Station, the lobby was sparkling, the bellman exceptional, and the check-in flawless. It's not the fanciest place, more suited for the upscale business traveler (though I spied many families too) but the cleanliness, a huge factor for me, absolutely perfect. And my room, a King, was HUGE. Not huge just by NYC standards, huge by any hotel standard. The view from our particular room wasn't much to see, but windows that actually open in both the room and bathroom were a bonus. The amenities were lovely, towels and robe divinely soft, the bed linens super comfy, and a pant press a blast from the past. The room was modern, simple, understated, private, quiet, and cozy. Everything worked too. Which should go without saying but unfortunately is often not the case in any class of hotel. The real silverware, plates, and glasses provided were a great compliment to the microwave and fridge. Did I mention that housekeeping is outstanding? In my years of travel, I've never seen more competent housecleaning. My interaction with the staff was easy peasy. Items I needed were sent up immediately, dinner spots/phone numbers provided, and I was always greeted with a smile. I dreaded check out because it meant our experience was over. I literally had zero complaints during my entire stay except that the Indian restaurant next door (that serves as the San Carlos' complimentary breakfast serving area and then offers their own menu for limited room service too), is simply not up to par with the rest of the hotel.  If 24 hour American cuisine room service is a make it or break it deal for you, that's about the only reason I'd consider finding a different hotel. Seeing as Manhattan has every food conceivable, most of it deliverable, I easily overlook this.Quiet rooms, pleasant interiors/halls, a great business center/overflow lobby, elevators that were kept constantly cleaned (check the Ritz for smudges, lol), and staff that valued my business means that next I'm in NYC I'm making a beeline right back here. Sure, there's more glamorous or hip spots, but for the level of service vs price and comfort, there's a reason this is a hidden gem amongst your hundreds of NYC hotels. Part of me doesn't want the secret to get out.  ","Dallas, Texas","Ella K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",17,5.0

The staff is enormously friendly and accommodating, courteous and fun. During what is a very hectic time in the City, the staff continued their excellent service, and the prices were entirely reasonable. The location, in midtown East is ideal, near to metro service and within easy walking distance of lots of excellent restaurants, diners, and attractions.In addition to the warmth of the staff, the San Carlos did a great job this year of getting us all into the holiday spirit with their tasteful and clearly upscale decorations throughout the lobby and waiting areas.

Will definitely stay there again. Hotels in New York are outrageously priced during the Christmas season. The San Carlos was a bargain. It is older, but nicely furnished. Similiar to a Marriott. Free breakfast in the morning(fresh pastries and bagels, yogurt), refrigerator in room, free wifi, business center and Aveda products in the bathroom. Beds were nice and comfortable and the room was much larger than ones at the W on Lexington. Nice diner across the street for quick meals; breakfast and afternoon snacks. Right near the Waldorf for drinks and easy subway access. Bellman made limo reservations for us to take us to and from the airport; otherwise 2 cabs were needed. Arranged a car service for us at night. Suites were $100 per night higher and had a full living room and kitchenette. Plenty of places nearby to get a drink. Staff was friendly and helpful. Have stayed at the Omni Berkshire and the Kimberly in the past which have more ambience but cost a lot more. Will stay here in the future for the price. Another reviewer complained about the poor lighting, plumbing rattle, view of wall and inadequate breakfast. Yes the backside faces a wall about 25 feet away but you don't hear the horns blasting away in the morning on 50th. If he paid more, he could have had a room that faced the street. The bathroom is small but adequate and no plumbing rattle. Breakfast is better than Hampton Inn or Courtyard, and it is free in NYC. My lighting was fine, not inadequate. If you want luxury, stay across the street at the Benjamin or the New York Palace. This is a nice hotel, just not a fabulous hotel.","West University Place, Texas","lonestartravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West University Place, Texas</strong>",55,5.0

We were on the 17th floor w/ not much of a view and some minor street noise, but never anything disruptive. The staff were always smiling, helpful, and competent. And to top it off, the location cannot be beat--close to every thing we wanted to see and do: Rockefeller Center, the 5th Ave shops, hansom cab rides, tea at The Plaza, etc. If you're looking for 24 hour room service and a grand lobby, this is not the place for you. But if you want a nice, clean, convenient place to relax between outings, this place more than fits the bill.

We got an extremely reasonable price for a family suite and kept wondering after that why should we ever bother with the unreliable AIRBNB service ever again...We felt so pampered at the hotel!!The suite was spacious. There's a bedroom with very comfortable bed, TV and closet. The living room has a foldout double sofa, with a very thick and comfortable mattress. Since we are 5 people they brought in another single bed, and the room still felt spacious. The living room area also has a TV, two armchairs, a small dining area with 4 chairs and a real kitchenette with microwave, small but real refrigerator and plenty of dishes. For breakfast, though, we used the hotel dining room downstairs. No cooked food, but still enough to get you started in the morning.The only reservation we have about the room is the fact you can't really open the windows for fresh air (2nd floor) because the cooking fumes and odors you get from the restaurant next door. However, ventilation system is rather efficient.Staff were very helpful and kind. They make you feel very much ""at home"" and as if each visitor is ""a regular"". Last but not least: Location! Initially we wanted to go for the village, but we actually found this location to be even better: easy access to all parts of the city and important destinations - central park and the museums, the MOMA is within minutes walk, Times Sq is close enough to walk and yet far enough... 5th avenue shopping area is really close.

We could hear a little bit of street noise, but it is NYC after all. The hotel itself was very quiet--I never heard any noise from other rooms. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Be sure to pick up a map! We also loved the bowls of fun size candy bars at the front desk. I'm not sure if that was leftover from Halloween or if they're always there, but my friends and I always made a quick stop to pick up a Hershey bar on the way in or out. One guy at the front desk was particularly helpful by arranging for a limo to take the 6 of us to our dinner destination one evening. We saved a bit on cab fare that evening and enjoyed the ride in the limo! The hotel is very convenient (1 block) to the subway on 51st and Lexington. There is also a great bagel place, Ess-A-Bagel on 3rd at about 49th or so.

While the service and amenities are not up to the same standard as a 5 star hotel, I had a very nice stay and would go again. Having two rooms plus a small kitchen counter and sink is a plus. If you are traveling and prefer to buy take-out and eat in your room it is a good set-up. Plus if you are on a business with your spouse one person can work, talk on the phone or watch TV while the other sleeps in the bedroom.

From the minute we arrived we were treated like old friends. The front desk (Evelyn & Gabriel) were helpful and tried their best to get an early check in into our suite beacuse we arrived at about 9 a.m., but nothing was availble. While we waited, the front desk staff entertained our kids with magic tricks! When they did get us in (still a few hours earlier than official check in time) they gave us a beautiful suite on the 16th floor (quiet, spacious, good air conditioner-we were there during a heat wave). . The bell staff (Bobby, Johan and Matthew) were friendly and knowledgable, and gave us good suggestions for families since we were tourists traveling with a 10- & 11-year-old. During our stay there were thunderstorms and the hotel had ""loaner"" umbrellas near the door for our use as we cruised around the city, which was great.I've read complaints from others about the conteniental breakfast, but we thought it was plenty of food and choices. Since it was included in the room price for the four of us, it was a terrific value (you can't beat free). The breakfast consisted of rolls, assorted pastries, bagels, (the little chocolate croissants were especially yummy), tea, coffee, hot chocolate, milk, orange juice, assorted yogurts, cottage cheese, whole apples, assorted jams, cream cheese, Rice Krispies and Corn Flakes. The nice lady working at the breakfast kept everything well stocked throughout the morning (7-10 a.m.)Our suite was clean and well appointed and roomy (we couln't believe we had that much space in mid-town Manhattan). The housekeeping staff was wonderful too. They were available the minute we requested anything. Returning from our daily adventures, the place was always spotless and my dirty dishes were the all done. What a luxury! The kitchenette came with a microwave, refridgerator, sink, dishes/service for 4 +. The Hotel location is also wonderful. It's walking distance to many attractions and a variety of restaurants (although there is a subway station not too far away). The front door staff is on top of it when you need a cab hailed (although much of the time we just tried to walk off the great Italian food we'd eaten in the neighborhood).The staff of the hotel went well above our expectations.

I am beyond particular and Gabriel was attentive to the requests that I had made when making the reservation. He actually let me look at a couple of rooms to make sure that my preferences were met. The room that I chose was not yet available (it was very early) so I shopped for a while. When I returned to the hotel, Gabriel said that the owner of the hotel wanted to meet me. I travel at least 80 days a year and have for several years--I've never met the hotel owner. The owner was charming and lovely and was clearly interested in making sure I had a good stay. My room was lovely--a beautiful upgrade. The experience at the San Carlos was very much like staying at a friend's beautiful apartment. Everything was clean and fresh. The bed and linens were a good quality. The location of the San Carlos is excellent with subway and bus lines within steps. I prefer midtown east--so this location is really perfect.

This enabled us to order groceries on line for delivery on arrival (see The Food Emporium on the web) so that we had easy meals and snacks in the room when the kids ran out of steam.

We usually stay at Berkshire Place or The Benjamin, in a suite, but neither hotel was available, so based on recommendations from hotel.com (which Delta connected us to), and the high ranking on Tripadvisor, we chose The San Carlos Hotel. It is in the same block as The Benjamin and The Waldorf Towers, a couple of blocks down 50th from Saks, and a straight route to Rockefeller Center, if you need to get your bearings. Hotels.com had a good rate, but the San Carlos website had an even better non-refundable rate.We arrived at 9.30 am, checked our bags and were shown to the breakfast room for a complimentary breakfast. Our room was great...a king executive suite on the 9th floor. It was one very large room, with a kitchen (true coffeepot, microwave, refrigerator, etc) and dining alcove and a sofa bed. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the room was very large and quiet. We never once waited in line at the desk or for our bags and when we requested something for our room, it arrived instantaneously. One plus or minus is that there was no hassle waiting on assistance getting our bags to our room..we had carry-ons and took them ourselves. The hotel is pretty casual in that way, but leaves out no necessities and handles everything expeditiously.The business center never had a wait for the computers, and thre is no charge for printing or use of the computers.Breakfast was a little hectic, but it was nice to have yogurt, toast, pastries, juice, etc. without leaving the hotel.One of my favorite restaurants, Mint, is next door and owned by the hotel. Mint is a fabulous Indian restaurant with great ambience. Also, on the food topic, just around the corner is Pax, where you can get perfect salads and other items for your room.When I checked out, the manager brought the owner out to meet me, and if I had not already planned to write a rave review, I would have after meeting him. He is extremely personable and wants to be sure that his guests intend to return.We took the hotel car to the airport for about $10 more than a cab and it was perfect...quiet, clean, on time, and hassle free. I do not believe there is any room service, but there are enough good choices for dining out or for bringing gourmet foods back to your own kitchen.

We usually stay right in Time Square, but bid on a two-night stay at San Carlos Hotel at a charity event to try something different. We were very pleasantly surprised and will stay here again! It is away from the crowds, but is within easy walking , subway or taxi distance from everything. Parking is right next door with discounts for hotel patrons. It was $30 for 24 hours, but we have an SUV so we had to pay an extra $10 for an over-sized vehicle. Still less than parking in Time Square. On our last day, the doorman had us park in front of the hotel after checking out so that we wouldn't have to pay extra in the parking garage. The staff was fantastic and had great suggestions for restaurants, transportation, and sight-seeing. We stayed in an executive suite which I would suggest if you have grown children. There was a king bed and a large sitting area with a pull out sofa-bed. The sitting area had two other chairs so there was plenty of room for all of us. We brought an inflatable twin mattress so our two kids had their own sleeping space and even with the sofa-bed out and mattress inflated, there was room to walk around. We entered the room to see a brand new 42"" flat screen still in the box in the living room. They installed it while were hit the town! The suite had a kitchenette area with a breakfast bar and two chairs which was nice. It was separated from the sleeping area a little bit so any early risers could have coffee without tiptoeing around the sleepers. There was also a small refrigerator and microwave. The kitchen was stocked with utensils and plates, and no dishwasher since housekeeping would do the dished every day :) The bathroom was adequate, but not overly large and we had two good-sized closets. This was a very roomy space for NYC! Only downfall for some travelers might be the nightclub across the street. There was a line outside starting at about 11:30 to midnight and we could barely hear them talking, but we really couldn't hear the music inside. We were on the 6th floor so if you go higher, you might not hear anything. We did hear some people singing happy birthday outside the club at around 2 a.m., but we just went back to sleep. The club patrons were not rowdy. They seemed very classy and definitely drove nice cars and showed up in limos.

Everything is spotless, very well maintained and it obvious they must replace immediately anything that gets worn out.It is a good feeling to stay there...WE had a one bedroom suite, consisting of a bedroom with a king bed, a large bathroom, a living room with a sofa bed, a second smaller bathroom and a small kitchenette area with a micro, a sink and dishes and cutlery and a small fridge.There is also a mini bar and a table with two chairs. There was an iron board and iron and a pant presser. Two flat big TVS. Actually everything that we needed was there. They also have FREE wi fi, and also a free breakfast that it is simple, yet comes very handy. IT consisted of coffee, good juice, tea, chocolate, all kind of breads and Danish , cream cheese, butter marmalade and organic yogurts.Breakfast is self service and in paper cups but nevertheless it was done with some flare.Location is very good in 50 between Lexington and Third, the 49-50 crosstown bus makes it very convenient , also a block away is the 6 Subway convenient to go to places like Soho, and one more block the E line good for Greenwich Villages and the Meatpacking district.May be the best thing was that all the people that work there are very pleasant and helpful. Sheets were changed , either every day or every other day, I am not sure, but they were of very good quality and impeccable.WE got a very good rate taking advantage of a 20% discount if pre paying.Never in New York I got all this in one hotel. It was indeed a lovely stay. We had with us one of our grandchildren sleeping in the the living room;s sofa bed while his parents and siblings stayed in separate suite.I highly recommend this very well kept property.

We knew we could get as far as New York, so on our last night in Mexico we went onto tripadvisor and found the San Carlos in NYC (we had stayed in NYC on our outward journey and knew the area we wanted to be in). After reading the positive reviews we went to the website and got a room for 2 nights that could accommodate the four of us. Yes it was pricey, but all good midtown New York hotels are pricey when you're booking them the night before arriving.Check in took about 30 seconds, and the room was great. Had a fridge (separate to the mini-bar) and a microwave, and bowls/plates/cutlery. Very practical. The hotel has no room service but links to a number of restaurants that will deliver to the hotel and allow you to eat in the room (and charge it to your room as well). Much better quality room than the midtown Omni Berkshire where we had stayed for 4 nights on our outward journey en route to Mexico.Complimentary buffet breakfast was included at the San Carlos, which was a real bonus for New York. The breakfast seems to be the main source of complaint on the tripadvisor reviews. Get over it, it's free, what do you expect? And, we thought it was fine. Toast, good quality orange juice, fruit, yoghurt, tea/coffee - our kids were happy, and we saved ourselves a fortune over our extended stay. I'm sure that the Walfdorf Astoria around the corner would quite happily welcome the moaners in for breakfast at $30-$50 per head! We originally booked for 2 nights, but European airspace remained closed and we had to extend our stay. The hotel was extremely accommodating and at short notice let us extend the room. We were then told by British Airways that we could not get a flight back for another 8 nights (!!!). Unfortunately the San Carlos said that they did not have that same room available for that length of time, but gave us a 15% discount on a suite, which meant we got a room that was twice as big, extra TV, sofa, armchairs, dining area, kitchen sink, fridge , microwave etc for about $25 per night more, for our extended stay. It was a fantastic room (actually 2 rooms and a bathroom) for midtown new york - much like an aparthotel. In fact it was similar to rooms at the Affinia 50 aparthotel, right across the street, but cheaper....and available, which the Affinia wasn't.The hotel had a business/internet lounge with 6 fast PCs and printers, all free of charge. These were frequented most of the time by me and the other stranded European guests looking for flights home! The internet access was great as it enabled us to see that flights were becoming available, which we then phoned up and booked. It meant that we didn't need the full eight nights and our total length of stay was 5 nights. The desk staff were very accommodating and said ""no problem"" and still gave us the 15% discount.Also should mention are eating options. No restaurant directly in the hotel, but in the lobby there is an adjoining door to the Mint Indian restaurant next door. Fantastic food, and most notable was that it was full of Indian guests, always a good indicator. We ate there on 3 of our 5 nights. Our 2 children 13 and 9 ate everything presented at them - no burgers , nuggets or fries in sight. Hotel had a great location - 1 block from 51st/Lex Subway and 3 blocks from 53rd/Lex Subway which gives you a choice of 3 subway lines. For cheaper options for food (to take back to the room) turn right out of the hotel and then go north one/two blocks on either 3rd or 2nd avenues. Plenty of delis and supermarkets, which you don't tend to see on Lexington, Park or Madison aves (the other direction).So in summary, a great hotel - we would definitely stay there again if we go back to New York. Staff very welcoming and helpful, particularly Bobby on the door/concierge duty. I've stayed in New York 4 times, twice for business, twice for pleasure. By far the best hotel, and not the most expensive.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","AfricanWanderer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",12,5.0

Most of the 4 & 5-star hotels in the Midtown/Upper East had no Q/Q this week, I guess because of Spring Break & Easter, so I was pleased to find one at the San Carlos & booked it thinking it could be a backup plan. Nothing else emerged, so I was hesitant but I was completely satisfied. I know a 4-star experience often comes with constant concierge, doorman, more happening lobby, on-site restaurant, but I require none of those (sometimes find them annoying, frankly), and the San Carlos has a small but perfectly clean and nice lobby and the concierge wasn't always around. But the rooms are HUGE and very clean, very decent linens, soft towels, and one of the quickest elevators ever. When we checked in, we were upgraded to a suite, which concerned me at first because bed-sharing wasn't an option and it meant I was on a sofa bed. She said, ""Don't worry, it's very comfortable."" I was skeptical, but she was right. It's a foam mattress and I requested a duvet and extra pillows, and they were promptly brought to the room. I slept well and only heard any noise from another room inside the hotel one time in 4 days. There was some expected street noise, but we were on the 12th floor, and it certainly didn't affect any sleep. And the suite had the sofa, 2 chairs, a desk, a huge dresser, a kitchenette with a fridge, microwave & sink, 2 barstools, and TWO closets with ample hangers. I had a very good experience with all the staff I worked with and would recommend a stay here for a low-frills, very nice experience.","Chapel Hill, NC","alitris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chapel Hill, NC</strong>",2,5.0

Every wall, the floors, window curtains and shower curtain are all very blah beige. There is limited room service provided by the Indian restaurant in the building.","Friendship Heights, Maryland","hibye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Friendship Heights, Maryland</strong>",2,4.0

This time, we stayed 4 nights in a suite. Not cheap, of course, but we needed two beds and a couch, and having a separate living room is a real plus. The service is, I would guess, as good as you would get spending $900 a night rather than $275 plus tax. The rooms are spacious, the ambience is quiet, and the owner (who is there every morning, I think) is a joy to talk to.The service at the hotel is first-rate. It *can* be a problem getting a cab at a busy time, but they try hard for you, at the door. (In a pinch, you could sneak over to the Waldorf and pretend to be a customer). And if you are going to the airport, they'll have a cab at the door, if you ask. I'll add to the chorus, though: For such a superb hotel, the breakfast really is subpar. I believe they have plans to upgrade it.For many a tourist, the location really can' t be beat. The Waldorf is just out the back door, and it's worth the money to splurge for tea or a cocktail there. St. Patrick's and Rockefeller Center are an easy walk, and on a nice day there is nothing nicer than to take a cab or the subway up to the Metropolitan Museum, and walk back through the Park or down Madison Avenue. And for a Broadway show, if you've got legs, its close enough to walk back from a Broadway play if you can't get a cab.And while we didn't go to a play, we *did*, some of us, stroll down to Grand Central to eat at the Oyster Bar.","Santa Rosa, California","srca</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Rosa, California</strong>",100,4.0

The San Marcos offers a two QUEEN bedded suite with a pull out sofa which was a perfect sleeping set up for this trip without having to get two rooms. The room and common areas are very nice for a 3 star. This smaller property is a 3.5 and could be higher except that it is more an apartment rental than a large full service hotel.

It does however offer 24 hour front desk and doormen, internet, and a small cardio gym, InnCom, flatscreens and usual inroom amens. The room and common areas are up to date, pretty well maintained, and clean. The rate for our room was reasonable for 3 nights, 4 people, at 1048.US.

The hotel itself is in a great spot- handy to the subway station one block up and the Rockefeller centre and 5th Ave shops.As some of the other reviews have stated the continental breakfast was poor and let this hotel down. The plastic plates, paper cups and plastic cutlery made this hotel seem cheap.It is not hard to put on a simple but nice breakfast. Also all the disposable cutlery and plates etc is not really good for the environment- especially in light of the global drive to go green. Surely some proper knives and forks and china plates and a dishwasher would be more environmentally friendly??Suggestion for breakfast food:bowls of fruit freshchoice of 3 stewed/canned fruit with a choice of cereals/muesli and yougurtsa good selection of bread to make toast- some pastriesplatters of sliced cheese, tomatoes, hamselcetion of spreads eg jams, peanut butter, marmiteteas and coffeeThis is easy and cost effective.We choose to go to Pret a Manger for breakfast after expericencing the first morning's food on offer!Other than the breakfast we really enjoyed our stay here, the complimentary use of the computers on level 2 was excellent.We would probably stay here again if the breakfast improved.","Auckland, New Zealand","littlemssunshine16</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",17,4.0

We checked in and were told we ""were upgraded to a better room"", whatever that meant - but we were pleased. We arrived on the 4th floor and immediately all you could smell was stale smoke. We overlooked this assuming our room would be fine, but it too also smelled badly of stale smoke. I thought rooms in NYC were non-smoking, but apparently I was wrong given the air purifier functioning in our room, as well as an ashtray in the top drawer of the nightsand. After trying to deal with it for about an hour, we finally we down and asked for a new room. We were told the bell captain would be right up to move us. After 20 minutes of packing, and still no bell captain, I finally went downstairs asked for our keys to our new room, and headed back up sans the bell captain to help us. My spouse and I relocated to what was promised to be a ""comparable room"" on the 6th floor. Unfortunately we got downgraded from a King to a Queen, and also had a handicapped room with a disgusting tile bathroom floor with visible dirt in the cracks. To make matters worse, I opened the toilet and found someone else's waste there - unflushed! I flushed once, and quickly realized the issue, it was clogged. Immediately water started running over the top and on to the floor - so we called the front desk. Staff showed up with a wet/dry vac and got rid of the water, but not the feeling in the back of our head that we would now be using a bathroom where fecies had spilled over and on to the floor. One of the perks was that after about 10 minutes after this fiasco we did receive a platter of wine and other snacks as an apology from the hotel. Other positive notes of the hotel included the location, free wireless, and a second floor business center/lounge area with 6 working computers. In hotels much larger than the San Carlos, I have seen just one or two computers that the hotel expects all guests to share.

I don't recall seeing a doorman/doorwoman to greet us (not a biggie) at the time. We had no problems with check-in, though we did detect a bit of a ""stuffy"" attitude from one of the front desk clerks. Not sure what that was all about.

The room size was decent, I must say (I heard some hotel rooms are really small in NYC; we reserved a room with a king-size bed). OK, there were some, how do I put this, ""housekeeping"" issues that needed to be addressed. I will preface the following by saying this: I'm kind of ""anal retentive"" when it comes to bath towels, bathrobes, etc. There were some dark stains on the rug (perhaps a carpet cleaning would do the trick). Also, when I got into bed that evening, our bed sheet had a rip in it. When I was hanging up some of my clothes in the closet, there were two San Carlos hotel bathrobes hanging up that clearly needed to be thrown out. They had stains on them and were ripped. Finally, the next morning when I went to get into the shower, I found one of the towels had a bar of soap stuck to it. Ew! I called housekeeping, and someone promptly brought me fresh, warm towels to replace all of the ones that were in our room. Before we left to go sight-seeing that morning, I left a couple of notes, asking for new bathrobes to use (I wound up not using them, but thought perhaps the next guests might want ones that weren't nasty) as well as a bed sheet that wasn't torn. When we got back that evening, not only were my requests honored, we were given extra Aveda amenities and mints on our pillows. Well done!The bed was VERY comfortable and the shower was great! We slept like a rock (room was pretty quiet). Loved the Aveda products! I didn't realize they make mouthwash, too.The complimentary breakfast was pretty good (OK, so they didn't have a hot breakfast, but muffins, pastries, yogurt, cottage cheese, bagels, fruit, juice and coffee..what more do you want?!). There was one morning we didn't make breakfast; we wound up going to the Morningstar Tavern for breakfast (as well as a couple of other meals...their menu is enormous, and the prices are fairly reasonable). The hotel is also conveniently located near the subway and lots of attractions. When it was time to leave, Luis, the bellman/doorman, was very helpful.

Chose it because of a special deal that gave 3rd night free for a 3 day suite booking and of course because of the positive views here in the Tripadvisor. However, I must say San Carlos didn't meet the high expectations set by those positive views. It is a very typical boutique hotel that there are even 5 in the 50 meter radius from the hotel (in fact stayed at Affinia50 opposite San Carlos last year and preferred it more). San Carlos is not bad but there is nothing really special for the price you are paying. Yes, there is a complimentary continental breakfast included but it is in a windowless corner room and with a very limited offering that can be beaten by any basic 2 star airport hotel. Maybe the worst disappointment was for the service. It wasn't overly friendly and you had to ask for everything rather than the service being offered. It was also disappointing that during the first day the receptionist was selling us a helicopter tour and his only reason was ""You should really do it because we get a commission for it. You should help us make our living"". I hate it when the service people see customers being there just to make their living rather than them being there making the customer happy. Left a really bad taste about the whole place which was a shame.

I am in New York every other month or so, to visit famliy, and none of us had ever heard of the San Carlos before! I usually like to stay in midtown, and the location, at the intersection of 50th and Lexington ,is central to many NY attractions (although it is about a $13 cab fare to downtown). Check-in was a breeze. The lobby is small, but simple, elegant and quiet. I booked a Corner Superior Room for $399 a night (mid week) and found out I had been upgraded to a Corner One Bed Room Suite! Sweet!!!!! Our room (701) was on the 7th floor. It had a mini kitchenette (microwave, sink, table, chairs, coffeemaker, plates, glasses, etc.), a very generous size sitting room, a nice size bedroom with a large queen bed (maybe a small king, we couldn't quite tell), a full bath (large by NY standards) and 2 generous closets. In addition, we had 2 flat screen TVs, fully stocked mini-bar and Aveda bath products. Our views of 50th St. and Lex. were great. You can hear a bit of street noise from the 7th floor, but I am a very light sleeper, and it did not disturb me.The bedding was very soft and comfortable, but the bed was a little harder than I like it. As I was getting ready for bed, I noticed a little sign on the nightstand that said that housekeeping will has various pillows and bed toppers to chose from. I was too tired at that point to see if they has a pillow top for my mattress.The room and bathroom were spotless, as were all common areas. I never had to wait for more than a minute or so for an elevator. My room rate included a continental breakfast, which was served in a room off the lobby. The breakfast was adequate. All tables were taken, so I took my cottage cheese, yogurt and pastry up to my suite, and enjoyed it there. All of the staff I encountered was super friendly and helpful. Someone at the front desk got my husband and I a dinner reservation at Avra for that evening, after we had called ourselves, and were told they were all booked. I don't even think she was a conceirge, but like I said, the staff was wonderful!There is an Indian restaurant on-site, but the room service menu was very limited. If room service is very important to you, this is the one area that this hotel seems lacking in.As a veteran NYC traveler, I 100% recommend the San Carlos hotel.","Atlanta, Georgia","Gwenn W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",60,4.0

We booked an Executive suite which as well as the usual huge double bed contained a sofa bed, armchairs, separate dining area and kitchenette. The suite was extremely well kept and provided a very comfortable base for the six day holiday. The hotel is two blocks away from the major shops on Fifth Avenue and a block away from the nearest subway station. Concierge services seemed to be more of a team effort than other hotels and I believe the guests benefit from this approach. In particular Matthew, Quron and Jamal were excellent.We didn't hang around for breakfast at the hotel, but went instead to the Morning Star Cafe on 2nd Avenue.

With its address on E. 50th between Third and Lexington Avenues, the San Carlos is an ideal location. The Lexington Ave subway is around the corner, Rockefeller Center and Fifth Ave shopping is three blocks west, and the Times Square area is several blocks west. If you wish to avoid the craziness but still feel close to Times Square and the theater district, this hotel is an excellent choice. On the second floor overlooking the lobby, the San Carlos provides three computers 24/7. There is also a printer which is helpful for “e-ticket” boarding passes. If you simply can’t leave the lap-top at home, there is wireless access throughout the hotel. Breakfast at San Carlos consists of a variety of breads (including raisin bread), rolls and bagels for toasting, as well as pastries, yogurt and cottage cheese. The dark chocolate pastry roll was particularly good! There was a fruit basket with the usual suspects, too. Beverages included coffee, tea, orange juice and a pitcher of water. Overall, I would say the San Carlos is a good choice for location and accommodation.

Booked this without seeing the mainly excellent reviews, based on a friend's recommendation, who I was going to NY with. My friend had stayed here loads of times so I kind of went along with it to avoid having to think where else to stay. I have seen this hotel described by some as a boutique hotel. Still not 100% certain what that really means, as I have also seen the Hudson described as boutique but in terms of design they are chalk and cheese with Hudson as hip, cutting edge and San Carlos very traditional new york.Stayed for 3 nights in September '07. Found nothing wrong with this hotel but at the end of my stay, I asked myself if I would stay here again. My answer was really no. Having now read all the excellent reviews on this hotel I cannot disagree with anything that has been written and my reasons for not wanting to return may not be valid to all people. I felt that the hotel was more of a business orientated hotel. You could walk in to the lobby, go up the lift to your room without seeing another guest. Those occasions you did see a guest - was usually corporate businessmen. Some people like the fact that its quiet but i felt it lacked atmosphere and character.We had a 1 bed suite which was not cheap. $600 a night. But even the standard rooms are $400 a night. The decor was ok. Inoffensive but not luxurious by any means and was certainly not hip or cutting edge. The size of the room was good with a leage seating lounge separate to the bedroom. Air con was a bit noisy but you got used to it. Bathroom was very small and could have done with updating.The location is good, central to Lexington and 5th. The lobby staff were good and helpful.Therefore in summary there was nothing I didn't like about this hotel. but there was nothing really i loved about it either....and for the price (which is not so much in the Top price range, but seems to be the Deluxe price range) i think i expected something a bit more.Not for me then, but would suit others. If you want a hotel with a buzz, good atmosphere, somewhere to hang out in the lobby and do a bit of people watching, I would look elsewhere. But if you're happy with a quiet sanctuary from the bustle of NYC, with a good location, using the hotel purely as a base it may well suit.","Edgware, United Kingdom","NWLondontraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edgware, United Kingdom</strong>",130,4.0

It was the smallest hotel room I've ever been in. We were really unimpressed having read other reviews and viewing pictures online. I went back to reception and explained that we booked the hotel because the rooms looked spacious and comfortable but our bed was hard and our room was tiny! The receptionist apologised and told us he would move us the following day, he couldn't have been nicer about it. The following day we were moved to a room on the 15th floor, it was at least three times the size of the original room and the bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on! We were delighted. Lots of TV stations to choose from after a hard day shopping and great shower and bathroom!The location of the hotel is perfect. We walked most places as the main shopping areas are within walking distance. It was my second time in NY and my boyfriends first but he couldn't get over how well laid out the streets are. The breakfast is quite good in the hotel. We had toast and yoghurts most mornings although one morning we decided to treat ourselves and went across the road to the diner and had sausages and eggs. Quite reasonable and the food is very tasty. It's across the road to the left, beside Kimberly Suites.We didn't try the room service. I would also recommend the steak house across on 3rd Avenue, Smith & Wollensky - best steaks we've ever had. Quite pricey but the food is amazing!The staff in the hotel were exceptional! One of the doormen in particular. I didn't catch his name but he comes out and opens the cab door for you when it pulls up, offered us an umbrella when it was raining, he was just a really nice guy.

All the staff we met are a credit to the Hotel, and are always very pleasant and helpful. My sister and I stayed in a spacious and very comfortable one bedroom suite on the 5th floor, with 2 double beds, 2 tvs, bathroom and separate living area with fridge, microwave, coffee machine, etc. We had a street view, and yes it can be noisy but it is New York...you don't go there for the peace and quiet! You get used to the noise very quickly and it didn't stop me from sleeping well. There was only two of us staying in this suite but it would probably suit up to 4 adults, as there is a pull out sofa bed in the living area also. The hotel also has a fitness room and lounge on the second floor with internet access available, if you have the time or inclination during your stay. They serve a great free continental breakfast each morning in a room off the lobby with things like oj, coffee, yoghurt, toast, pastries, which get topped up regularly. If you prefer a hot breakfast, recommend you try the deli across the road, which is open 24hrs. It was always full in the morning, and a lot of locals seem to use it. They also do take out as well. The hotel doesn't have it's own restaurant, but ""Mint"" is well worth a visit. A top class Indian restaurant with a fantastic atmosphere. The room service at the hotel is delivered from ""Mint"" and is well worth a try if you don't feel like going out. Also try ""Lilys"" on Lexington Ave for a lovely Sunday brunch. The hotel itself is in a great location, with a subway stop round the corner in 51st Street, you can get around Manhattan quite easily. Buy a Metro card , even if you are only there for a few days, it's well worth the money. The hotel is within comfortable walking distance to most sights, approx 15 minutes to Times square and Central Park, less than 10 to Rockerfeller. Although if your want to give your feet a rest, then try one of the many city bus tours about. For the second year we got a Grayline 48hr hop on hop off ticket, which covers uptown, downtown, Brooklyn and night tours for $49. It's a great deal, and although their main pick up point is at Times Square, the uptown tour stops outside the Waldorf on 49th Street, so you can join it there. Recommend the night tour, which will take you over to Brooklyn, worth it to see the Manhattan skyline alone. You can purchase tours like this and other attractions from the hotel reception, but it may come in the form of a voucher/coupon which you will need to exchange at the tour starting point/attraction for a ticket. Shopping wise, Woodbury Common is worth a visit, with a number of designer outlet stores, selling clothes, shoes, luggage, etc. There are regular buses to Woodbury Common from the Port Authority bus station. If shopping in Manhattan, remember to get your discount card at Macy's to get 11% of most goods there, although be warned you do pay tax on goods bought in Manhattan. To get back to the hotel itself, you won't go wrong if you book to stay here. I have recommended this hotel to many people since my first visit. The location of the hotel, standard of service and accomodation is excellent, and we felt really at home here, it was a wrench to leave. It certainly makes the New York experience one to remember.","Dumbarton, United Kingdom","Loulou72</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dumbarton, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

For those who are feeling energetic there is a great gym and on the 2nd floor computers with free internet. The bedrooms were spacious and kept very clean and we really appreciated the breakfast which was ideal for us. There was lots of different kinds of bread, croissants, muffins, yoghurts, butter, jams and cheese, a great way to start the day.

I can't say enough good things about this hotel. We are avid travelers and have stayed in many, many hotels. I always thoroughly research a hotel from the travel books I read but I base my decision on the public's opinion of the hotel (from reading the reviews). I always find that the people who stayed there are the most honest about the accommodations. My husband was hesitant to trust my judgement because he likes to be safe with name chain hotels, but now he can't say enough about how great a choice I made. We choose a hotel for the space, amenities and location. We had a very spacious room for NYC standards with two double beds, two nice windows with controllable roman shades, a comfortable sitting chair and ottoman with a table, a desk area with chair, an armoire with a flat TV and real plants in our room! The furniture was not jammed against each other either- there was lots of space to walk around. We loved the refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker in the room which is one of the main reasons why we chose it. The rooms are decorated in a modern, clean homey atmosphere with bathrobes too. It was extremely quiet in our room (we requested a quiet area of the hotel) with no street noise and we didn't even know there was a family next to us until we saw them leaving their room. We didn't have a view of anything but a building but I'll go to the beach for that. We weren't in the room most of the time anyway. The location was perfect, central to Fifth Ave, Rockefeller Center and the subway, etc. We actually were going to stay at the Waldorf Astoria (which was right on our corner) for $20 more a night but we read the reviews that said the rooms were small and not worth the price. So true! The service was wonderful. When we checked in, we were told about the gym, breakfast times and given coupons during our stay for shopping. Any question I asked of the staff was answered pleasantly. I got directions and a map for the subway and was shown a store around the corner I could go to for snacks and groceries. The doorman went to the corner for us to locate a taxi and set up a car service for us to get to the airport. It was ready and waiting for us when we left! My daughter (18) was most impressed that when she got in the elevator alone, a male employee stepped out and let her ride up by herself. She was also offered an umbrella when we left one night when it was raining and when she tried to return it was told to keep it. Umbrellas were lined up at the door for guests! What service! I did read the reviews about the breakfast just being yogurt, fruit and pastries, but my husband skips breakfast and my teenagers are happy with just a muffin so it worked for us. The assortment of pastries was very diverse and it was free so who's complaining. The only negative thing I could say about the San Carlos was the beds could be queen instead of double because my husband is rather tall and we weren't used to a double bed. But everything else made up for this. We are already talking about our next trip to NYC and staying again at the San Carlos. We loved it!

You can have as much or as little as you want. The staff were superb very helpful and made our stay much easier. Will be coming back and staying here again. A big hello to Virginia a voluntary member of an organisation called the Big Apple Greeters. New Yorkers who give up a few hours of their time to take you around a neighbourhood in New York, we would never have seen as much of Greenwich Village as we did so once again thanks for that. The hop on, hop off buses are good but can take a good hour/hour and half to do the loop so if you want to see a couple of attractions far apart this can be a little time consuming. Ice skating at the Wolfman ice rink and the buggy ride in central park are a must. For Shoppaholics Woodbury Common in New Jersey is a must you can go on a grayline coach for about $40.

It is in a good area and we felt quite safe walking about. An added bonus was the delicious buffet style continental breakfast. The staff were extremely polite and helpful - booking taxis, advising on restaurants, giving directions- even provided brollies for the sudden downpour of rain! Nothing was too much bother.

Ticket agents on most street corners with bright yellow jackets! We paid 49 dollars each for a 48 hour pass but this gave us an Uptown tour, downtown tour, Brooklyn Tour (don't miss that one - the guide is a legend!!) free cruise to see Statue of Liberty (75 mins)tickets to the museum. All the tour guides were great and informative (leave a tip if you want to!) Saved on shoe leather and aching feet too!! One tip though - you can be on the bus a while especially due to the volume of traffic so a visit to the restroom before boarding is advisable!! There was scaffolding outside the hotel so the front was a bit obscured but looking around other buildings in the city - this was not unusual! Certainly didn't spoil our enjoyment!

Plenty of bagels, croissants, Danish Pastries etc. One suggestion would be go earlier at about 7:30. At this time we fund there was plenty of room to sit down and plenty of food to choose from.

The breakfast, which is included, was adequate. It is nice to have coffee and juice, etc. available for a quick start to the day. There were sweets and bread items, but very little fruit (apples?) and no eggs, cheese, or meat. There also was a small refrigerator full of Stonyfield Farms yogurts.We contacted the hotel directly to make the reservation because we wanted a one bedroom suite with two double beds, and I didn't see any available online. Even by calling the hotel, we were only able to get a one bedroom with a queen bed. When we checked in we were upgraded to a room I had not seen online, a one bedroom suite with a king bed and an additional half bath. It was a great room, and the extra half bath made a big difference for five of us getting ready in the morning!The staff was very responsive. When we called to have a rollaway bed delivered, it took less than 5 minutes to arrive. Also, we called the front desk pretty late a night (10 pm?) because we found that the window locks on three of our windows were not secure. The repairman was at our door in just a couple of minutes, and he fixed the one that was broken (and helped us lock the ones that we apparently weren't strong enough to lock our selves!).The location is great too.

The Deluxe rooms that I have stayed in previously are very nice, and compared to The W Hotel next door on Lexington, cavernous!

AND - it's free!Only two gripes about the San Carlos; one was the seemingly random restocking of the amenities (3 days without mouthwash!), and because they're only a small hotel I couldn't claim any reward points for the stay (which would have amounted to at least a free night with Marriott Rewards etc)..

(Housekeeping was very generous, leaving us over a dozen little bottles of Aveda shampoo, etc.) One of the two air conditioners in the room didn't seem to function properly, but we only noticed on the last day and reported it at check out. We were comfortable enough with the one working fine. We were at the back of the building on the 16th floor, so street noise was not a concern. The location of the hotel is excellent, and the subway (6 train) is just a block away. The continental breakfast was plentiful and fresh, but pretty standard fare. We did appreciate the convenience of a self-serve breakfast in the hotel, though -- we were able to eat and run, rather than go to a diner and wait for service, etc. The San Carlos staff was always very professional, polite, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.

The third room contained a king size bed, a nice dresser, two nightstands, a pants press (which I used to press shirts and skirts as well), and TWO closets. The bathroom had a tub and shower and a full length mirror. The air conditioning worked great and had a thermostat for better control (not just off all night so you are hot or on all night so you freeze). I could have stayed there indefinitely. The hotel had an excellent location in heart of Midtown East, one block from subway and an easy walk to excellent restaurants. They even had complimentary continental breakfast which is exceedingly rare in New York City. The price was $30 per night less than the horrible W Hotel.

We found the front desk staff to be very helpful upon check-in, but were extremely disappointed in another front desk staff person who failed to act or react when I called to vehemently complain about a peeping mini-bar employee. (Management made it right, but I had to actually appear at the front desk and tell my story.) No one offered any information, although they answered questions readily, and no one explained how the breakfast worked (hours, location, or even that it existed), or the fact that there are public computers and a printer on the second floor. I was glad I had learned everything I knew on this site! The breakfast was actually perfect for our individual tastes - I enjoyed the yogurts and cottage cheese, my daughter loved the hot milk to make her hot chocolate and pastries and my husband enjoyed the coffee and a variety of food each morning.BE WARNED: We reserved a ""2-room suite"", and had the opportunity to experience 2 very different configurations - unfortunately - since we requested to be moved after our first night. The street NOISE was horrendous...voices, music, traffic noise, honking, sirens - and ALL NIGHT, every night we were there. We were on the 5th floor the first night, and after hardly sleeping due to voices, music, and never-ending honking and sirens, requested to be moved to the back of the hotel. We were told that the 2-room suites all face the street ... They moved us to the 11th (of 18) floor, which didn't help at all. - we actually didn't sleep well a single night we were there. Don't know why they don't invest in sound-proof windows in those rooms? The master bed was comfortable, but my daughter's pull-out was horrible - sagging middle and very thin. She didn't seem to mind, for what that's worth.The location was excellent, just enough of a walk to all the outlying places we went (Central Park, theaters, shopping, restaurants, landmarks). We did miss having an official concierge - although the front desk staff tries, they made a couple of just so-so recommendations.

The breakfast was more than fine and we returned to the hotel for breakfast for the duration of our stay.Another small but pleasing benefit was the free internet and PCs with printer on the 2nd floor. Very handing as we checked into our return flights on line and received extra leg room exit seats!!!For the $290 we paid per room per night I have already recommended to others and will continue to do so.

Paid $269/night on quickbook.com. I loved this hotel. The rooms were large and included a fridge, microwave, utensils, and coffee maker. The bathroom was large with a large counter. We were on the backside of the hotel so we had minimal street noise...(except for the car alarm that continued to go off for 30 minutes Saturday night!) The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Umbrellas were available during the rain. Complimentary breakfast was great. They had toast, muffins, danishes, yogurt, cottage cheese, etc. I recommend choosing this option as we went across the street to a diner for breakfast today and spent over $60 including tip! There were only 2 adults and 2 children. They have no children's menu, so my 5 year old got 2 scrambled eggs, pancakes, and bacon for $11.95! He wanted all of that and there was no way to make the combination at a cheaper price. The hotel is in a great location. Very close to the American Girl Doll store and Build a Bear for those of you with kids. There is a sub station very close (#6) to take you to other parts of NY. My only complaint is unfortunately big enough that I don't know if we'll stay there again. The bed was extremely firm. Now, I know that some people like that, but my husband and I do not! I'm curious to know if other posters felt the same. The second complaint is that the walls are rather thin. There was a family with children staying beside us and we could hear everything at 7:00 am when they chose to get up. We could hear their kids bouncing on the beds. We could even hear the kids pushing the light switches that are over the bed on and off...over and over again. We could hear their alarm clock go off and also heard it go off again after they had already left the room. I had to call the front desk to get them to turn it off. These may not seem like a big deal to some, but I'd sacrifice some of the space from a big room for a comfortable bed. After all that walking...you just want to sleep good at night! :)",South Carolina,"klmr11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Carolina</strong>",5,4.0

(Fortunately there was a luncheonette across the street.)  Ask for a room on the back side and away from the housekeeping closet.

One of my biggest ""must haves"" in a hotel is that it be very clean with updated decor and furnishings. This hotel had both. I was very impressed. We took advantaged of an ""off season"" promotion...stay two nights get the third free, I think we paid $260 a night?? This deal scored us a one bedroom suite with a king sized bed. It was plenty big for my husband and I and I would actually say it was be large enough for a family of four or for a girls trip of 4. We actually didn't really even take advantage of all the space. There is a full bath and a half bath which made getting ready great. The staff was friendly and the continental breakfast was a nice perk. Location was good. A subway station was close by and it seemed the walk to Central Park / 5th Avenue Shopping and Times Square were pretty much equal in time..give or take. The elevators were super fast for a smaller hotel. Maid service and turn down service was great. My only complaints would be the bed was very firm (which some people like), however the linens were very comfortable. Also, the street noise was distracting (mainly the horns coming from the nearby intersection), but we were on the front side of the hotel on the 10th floor. The rooms on the back may have been less noisy. On my last visit to NYC, a year earlier, on a girls trip we stayed at the Doubletree Suites located in Times Square. While I would recommend that hotel as well, I wanted to stay out of the Times Square crowd this visit. I enjoyed the location of the San Carlos Hotel, I felt a little less like a tourist. I will say that at the Doubletree, because our hotel room was so high and I assume because the building was newer and more sound proof, we heard NO noise from the street... and the beds were way more comfortable.

Also juice, coffee and milk. Last time I checked this IS a continental breakfast. And they are consisent and clean which as a frequent business traveler, this is what is most important. Rooms - The rooms are aged, as it is a boutique hotel in an old building, but I have yet to ever get a dirty room and the decor is very modern. Oh, and they tuck every night with chocolates every seems not to be mentioned, which is definately not something you will get at the Marriott, or some of the nearby hotels. Also, it they are generous with their toiletries (Aveda hair products, mouthwash, ear cleaner, hair cap, cotton balls, etc.) which is in line with a 4 star hotel. Also, bathrooms & linens are always clean with decent decor. Last, most rooms are pretty roomy and about 50% or more now have flat screen LCD TVs or an flat screen TV. There is a mini bar and all the basics like most decent hotels (coffee maker, blow dryer, robes, etc.). Security - They have security cameras EVERYWHERE, not because it is a bad place, but to make sure their guests feel and are always safe. I think this is super important. Gym - Although MOST hotels do not have gyms like the Leows hotel in Philly like a gym club, they do have a roomy gym with decent cardio equipment and water, towels and a bathroom. Noise - This is true, noise cannot be avoided, heck you are in between Lexington and 3rd, I choose this hotel for location and unfortunately, there will be lots of traffic & noise here. For me it is ok, b/c when I want to get out for a coffee or snack at 1 in the morning, there are always people around, so for me, safety overrules noise, but I admit it does not work for all. Service - I have yet to have any bad service, or any of the numerous collegues that I have recommended to stay there. Most of the time, they are super friendly and the door men, boy they can get you a taxi or give directions anytime. Computers - they have 3 computers and a printer on the 2nd floor for use for free. They also have free high speed broadband in all rooms. And the couple times I have a project crunch, the front guys have helped me by holding or sending off packages and faxing for me, which I do not abuse this, but it is nice to have in an emergency. Location - OK, within minutes you can be anywhere worth visiting in NYC. And for the business traveler, there is fed ex kinkos 3 blocks down on 3rd and also another on Lexington and 2 blocks up on Lexington a Staples. Also, there are several subways near by, like 1-2 short NY blocks away that can get you virtually anywhere in NYC. Shopping & restaurants galor, need I say more!!!I agree, there are much nicer hotels, at a heftier price, like the Waldorf, but for $300'ish a night this is a great deal and not less for any of the comparable hotels like the Benjamin or Affinia 50 (trust me, been there, they are pretty much the same!). What has won me over from San Carlos is how they treat their loyal customers, which is something I am seeing less of these days in this economy. I stay there every 2-3 weeks and I now have the owner's email to let him know when I am coming, what other hotel in the 300'ish range is going to care about one person????

We say NO. This hotel is quite less than what it and others says about it.First, the property is neither elegant nor charming and defnitely not sophisticated. The reality is that the property is nothing more than a bit above a Holiday Inn Express or similar hotels that you may find on any airport strip,Second, while the Hotel trumpets its offering of a free continental breakfast one would be well advised to brace themselves before viewing the selection and confines of the offering. A closed and spartan room with tables and chairs accompanied by an orange juice dispenser and toaster does not, a continental breakfast make. Third, previous commentary on Trip Advisor laud the staff for their friendliness and desire to accommodate. That was not our experience. On our arrival, we were confronted with ATTITUDE and plenty of it from the front desk representative who in a pre-emptory fashion dictated that one of the two rooms that we had booked was to be changed. No discussion or advance advisement. We challenged the representative and only when asking to speak to the Manager, were we able to arrive at a compromise.The room(s) were not elegant nor sophisticated but rather what would you expect from a hotel that is definitely not a 4 star hotel. The interior of our rooms on the 10th floor ( Junior Suite and Exec King) were well worn with the bathroom showing distinct signs of use and needing a good painting,Finally, previous writers on Trip Advisor have referenced the street noise. We agree and there was plenty of it. For a hotel that has spent a significant amount of money on refurbishment ( their words) and notwithstanding that New York is and can be a noisy city, the noise from the street at all hours is quite incredible.For our money ( and the hotel is not cheap) we say that the San Carlos is not what it seems nor says and to that extent, we say exercise caution in choosing the San Carlos Hotel.

We previously had reservations at the Avalon hotel, but the reviews of the Avalon started getting worse, so I took advantage of Tripadvisor's review and found the San Carlos. The San Carlos is PERFECT. We traveled with our two grandchildren (age 10 and 7 years) and they loved the hotel too. We took advantage of the business center on the 2nd floor to ""play"" on the internet during the evenings and the kids used the workout room a lot (always with our supervision). We enjoyed having the continental breakfast available...it was nice to have a quick bite to eat before we journeyed out in the morning. Gabriel at the front desk taught our grandson magic tricks (that was a hit!) and Matthew on the door was wonderful. Housekeeping staff are friendly and do a fabulous job. We also saw quite a bit of the hotel owner, whom we found to be charming. The kids were really impressed that the HOTEL OWNER knew them! You don't get that kind of attention in the chain hotels.We adored the rooms (we had a one bedroom suite), and appreciated having two televisions. The refrigerator and microwave both came in handy as we were able to bring leftovers home from restaurants and enjoy them later. The hotel is very quiet, and in a great neighborhood. We are from Seattle and we felt a lot safer walking around NYC after dark than we do in our city. It's also extremely close to a subway entrance.We were lucky enough to have Arlene Dunn as our Big Apple greeter (this is a great thing to schedule... you'll learn so much and it's free!). She felt like family to us. We took the all day Royal tour of New York and it was wonderful. Steve, the owner, was very informative and made us feel like he was an old friend who was showing us around his home town. His tour costs a little more than the others, but I think it is well worth it. He doesn't book a lot of people on each tour so you don't spend half your time waiting for someone to show up so you can go on to the next stop. We did most of the things that tourists do in NYC, and thought that the Top of the Rock was a better view than the Empire State building. Highlights:Tony and Tina's wedding (an interactive play). We all loved this! The Statue of LibertyTrinity Church, where the rescuers went on and after 9-11 (be prepared to cry).St. Patrick's CathedralA New York Yankee gameBronx ZooConey Island (everyone needs to go there once)Canal Street in Chinatown...you get to barter there, and believe me, it's very addicting.A cruise around all of Manhattan with Circle Line tours (we had a very informative and dapper narrator).

Located across the street from the comparable Kimberly and Affinia 50, we ike it better than either of those. The San Carlos offers a lobby with ample & comfy seating (unlike the Kimberly); a very well equipped, sunny ""fitness center"" with individual TV screens at each of the treatdmills, the recumbent bike, and stepper ( this workout room isn't huge, but this isn't a large hotel, I had the place to myself on more than one occasion); an attractive breakfast room; and a computer center on the mezzanine with 4 PC's which have high speed internet service and a laser printer for which there are absolutely no charges (also WiFi).The high-ceilinged rooms are generously proportioned, airy and serene with windows you can open (always a plus in my book) covered by both semi-sheer draperies to the marble sills and ""blackout"" Roman shades which operate smoothly. The climate controls in both the bedroom and LR & the variety of lighting throughout -- little ""downlights"" over framed artwork in both the living room and bedroom (we had a 1-bedroom suite), wall sconces, table lamps, overhead lighting and a good desk lamp -- are notable. And the contemporary furnishings are tasteful, comfortable and more upscale than those we found in our rooms at the Affinia or the Kimberly. In addition to the well-stocked ""honor bar"" (with less outrageous prices for its contents than at many Manhattan hotels), there is an under-the-counter refrigerator, a microwave, and small sink in the kitchenette/wet bar area whose cupboards and drawers hold glassware, dishware & flatware. The two closets and a number of deep drawers gave us more than enough storage space for our clothes & luggage. There are no drawers or cupboards in the bathroom, but the counter is wide and runs the length of the room, so we found it perfectly acceptable & the Aveda toiletries are a nice touch. Lastly, everything was scrupulously clean & well-maintained; we never heard any noise from fellow guests in the hallways or the rooms around/above us; and our sleep was not disrupted by street noise as is often the case in Manhattan.The free breakfast isn't the spread you'll find at the Embassy Suites, but it doesn't pretend to be more than a continental breakfast: the pastries were skippable, the coffee & OJ were above average. And since there are a number of eateries just outside the door and most hotels don't offer anything to their guests, I'm not going to knock the SC on this score. We did experience a few intermittent problems with the in-room internet access, but they were short-lived, and with the computer center on the 2nd floor, you'll never be ""stranded"".Where the San Carlos falls a bit short is on its front-end service. With the exception of Gabriel (who I think is the manager and seemed topnotch), the desk clerks and doormen were quite young... very pleasant, but not super polished, could use a bit more training & level of information about what's in the neighborhood. Check-in/check-out, however, was efficient and there were no errors in our billing.In short, given its location, the quality of accommodations and the amenities, the San Carlos is an exceptional value.

Well I know that's not what I look for in a hotel...I stayed at the San Carlos with two other relatives for a week in September and we all thought the experience was wonderful. The hotel has a very friendly and homely feel to it as I guess it's relatively small compared to some of the other hotels around the city. It was our first time to New York and all the staff were really helpful in advising us in what was worth seeing during our stay. There was always someone waiting outside the hotel to open the door for you when you came back to the hotel and the staff always said hello; nothing seemed to much trouble.I guess it was lacking in facilities compared to some of the giant firms, there is no pool or hotel bar/restaurant, but in New York you only have to step outside the hotel to find whatever you are looking for so we were not bothered at all by this. The gym was small but I thought it was brilliant, each station is equipt with a tv so you can watch while you work out. The cyber lounge is a brilliant idea and was really useful; there is even a printer if you need to print anything off.The rooms have such comfortable beds and are kept immaculately clean everyday by the wonderful housekeeping staff; the Aveda bath products are a great addition. The TV is fab too - a pretty big flatscreen - wonderful! You get a complimentary newspaper every morning and complimentary breakfast. Some people have complained about the breakfast but I found it pretty fine. It is basically just coffee, orange juice, yoghurts, bread, pastries and toast; we all found this wonderful though because we weren't interested in having anything too heavy for breakfast.Definitely worth the money and definitely worth staying in again.

For example, I called the hotel before coming down to ask how far away Bloomingdales and Central Park was. Not only were they nice about the phone call they obviously had some kind of map which they could reference saying how far these things were from the hotel. When the maid saw us going into the room she offered us more towels. The hotel is beautiful and has a great location. From the hotel we walked to Bloomingdales, Central park zoo, St.Patrick's cathedral and Times Square easily. I thought the decor in the hotel rooms was very classy and the rooms were immaculate.

My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our Valentine's day weekend thanks to the San Carlos Hotel. I booked an executive suite weekend special through the hotel's website about 2-3 weeks in advance and was excited to have a beautifully appointed and newly renovated room. On Friday, we parked the car next to the hotel, checked in and got upgraded to a one bedroom suite, then quickly made our way to the 14th floor (out of 18.) When we walked in we were amazed--closet and bar area to your left and bathroom (with a full length mirror on the door) to your right and straight ahead was the living room with new couches, chairs, endtables, a glass table (magazines included) and a 2 person eating area (with a lovely bamboo plant for decoration!) There was also an entertainment center which had the flat screen tv and N64 control (just in case) and next to that was the desk with complimentary high speed internet access (a huge plus--my boyfriend brought his laptop.) The door to the bedroom was just past the bar area on the left. The bed was a queen size, but we weren't complaining since there was the mini-bar in the room (which was adequately stocked--best bottled water ever, and the liquor/beer selection was great too) as well as another flat screen tv, alarm/cd player, a corby press pants, chair and closet. The bathroom didn't have a huge bathtub, but it was definitely up to par (be sure to make use of their bathrobes and aveda products.) Also to be noted was the separate air/heat controls between the bedroom and the living room. The suite was beautifully decorated with paintings and pictures and the bedding/furniture was modern yet had a homey feel to it. We thought ""if only there was a kitchen"" that we'd ask how much the rent was, we wanted to move in! Once we settled in, we made use of their delivery menus. Since there is no restaurant in the hotel yet, they supply you with 5 or 6 different types of restaurants that deliver--from Japanese to Italian. Ordering the food was a piece of cake and the bill gets added to your hotel account. The service at the hotel was excellent--they promptly brought up our food along with a bucket of ice, which we asked for. There was also alot of good on-demand movies to choose from, so we watched one later that evening. Saturday morning we woke up on our own (no maids knocking--they take the Do Not Disturb sign very literally) and ordered breakfast, although there is also a comlimentary continental breakfast between 7-10. When we had to leave the suite the doorman was ready to hail a cab for us. We were always greeted when we came back to the hotel. Check-out was also a breeze and was asked if we enjoyed our stay and if we were taken care of, which we were. All in all, we had a fantastic time at the San Carlos. We've stayed at many other hotels in the city, but this newly renovated gem on the east side is ranked #1 on our list so far, so we'll definitely come back in the future.",Suburb of New York,"TrailBlazer1011</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Suburb of New York</strong>",1,5.0
