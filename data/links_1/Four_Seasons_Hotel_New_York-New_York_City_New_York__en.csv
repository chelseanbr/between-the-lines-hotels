But the rooms have been brought forward. Plenty of plugs for charging, his/her separate clothes alcoves, good minibar, small sitting area with sofa table, separate desk. We asked for an additional small fridge for our yogurts, drinks etc., as they seemed reluctant to just empty the mini bar fridge, and they promptly provided the extra small fridge. Good bathroom, though unlike many Four Season properties, there is only one sink in the vanity and no separate WC. Although on 8th floor facing 57th Street, it was not noisy and sleep quality (including, especially the beds, linens, pillows) were excellent.

But, there a serious problems here.THE GOODThe location is terrific and the lobby is stunning. The room redesign is deceptively simple in muted tones. I had a corner Park Avenue Suite which was huge and airy with lovely high quality furniture and a residential feel. Nice the way the set up has a walk in closet, bar and spacious bathroom (odd it doesn’t have two sinks). The room service laundry and shoeshine were very fast and friendly. The concierge was good. That’s it for the good stuff.THE BADThe food is average but priced higher than London or Hong Kong. You can’t charge the prices they do and serve uninspired not so great food. Over five days, I had one dish I loved and would eat again - an Arctic char special. The Cobb salad is weird, the açaí bowl tastes bland, the omelette had no flavor, the croissants weren’t top notch, the kale salad was something I could get at Tender Greens, the Asian tuna salad wasn’t ahi as advertised and drowning in soy sauce. The list goes on and on. I love good food and will pay for it. But, I don’t care where I am - I won’t pay $250 for lunch for two without alcohol again and have an average meal. The receptionist who checked me was very harried and almost nervous. She forgot to give me the mini bar key. No fresh flowers in a $1,700 a night room, just fake orchids. Oh and the famous acacia trees in the lobby’s Garden restaurant are all fake. The servers are well intentioned but um shall we say not very polished.THE UGLYThere’s one reason I probably will never stay at this hotel again - ELEVATOR NOISE. I was on the 36th floor with only three or four other rooms and expecting a tranquil escape every evening. But NO given the structure of the building every room is adjacent to the old elevator shafts and all your hear is swooshing and cables rattling and the shaft creaking. I felt like I was in Blade Runner with jets flying over all night and had to sleep with ear plugs. Most of the staff is cold in personality. Also what is up with two loose sheets around a comforter. Why is there no duvet cover? Why do you have to ask for an espresso machine? Why is the shower water pressure so weak with no rain shower? Why do I hear the super loud suction toilets in other rooms? And why oh why can’t you have a proper dinner in a nice restraint at a hotel of this supposed caliber? It’s bar food or room service. That is ridiculous. Joel Robuchon left over 5 years ago and there’s yet to be a replacement.

My bags arrived in my room in a reasonable amount of time. the room was very nice. I went downstairs and spoke to the concierge to organise my dinner reservations. It took nearly an hour for them to confirm. On leaving the room there were flower peddles on the floor I told the desk on the way out. We came back from dinner at 11pm and they were still there. Check out was fast and efficent and breakfast was fantastic. Overall this is a very good hotel and Iwill consider it when I return to New York.,Monaco,"Lechiffre1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monaco</strong>",1086,4.0

The hotel sent up a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary, which was a nice surprise.

The food itself is tired last century midtown. Front desk is also great. Service in the room is bad. I can’t believe that they don’t automatically leave bottles of water by the bedside at turn down. I had to beg for water virtually every night. The internet service requires a pay upgrade to get anything useful....seriously in a very expensive room. Also they turn on all of the lights after servicing the room and leave them on all day. Then there is no switch to turn them all off. So i was a slave to their need to have all the lights on all the time. The bar area “ty” is frumpy and old. The service at the tables is good but ham fisted. The bar tenders lack any creativity. The ambiance is “waiting room”.... bar tenders are semi retired. For a hotel this expensive they are just checking the blocks all around. There are far better hotels in NYC.

I have very high standards and very high expectations when I am staying at a 5-star hotel and paying 5-star prices. That being said, I was extremely pleased with my most recent stay at the hotel. My room (a Gotham Junior Suite) was spacious and comfortable. The bathroom was huge with a large “dressing room” area. There is even a large shelf for your luggage in the dressing room so you do not need a luggage rack. The hotel manager, Michal Dedera, was always available to provide personal attention if needed and extremely responsive to one’s needs. You can always tell that a hotel cares about its guests by the responses on TripAdvisor. I always consult TripAdvisor before choosing a hotel and was extremely impressed that the hotel General Manager, Rudy Tauscher, took the time to respond to all the complaints in an extremely caring and sincere manner. For all the above reasons, the Four Seasons is my “go to” hotel in any city, and the Four Seasons Midtown did not disappoint. P.S.

I requested many things since I needed to store, sterilize and pump during my stay. Between the sterilizer, fridge (yes an extra freezer), microwave - I knew I asked for many things and they were absolutely helpful. Never saying no - always we will do our best, or simply yes. No problems.The incident was during the stay; I needed to store my breastmilk in their freezer (when it was full in the room), and to have them packed up with dry ice etc otw back to Indonesia. Thats a solid 24-26 hrs of travel time. I know how to do this, what I need etc. Now from all of the ones I sent down, quite a large amount in one pile was not stored properly by them. So they melted and I had to throw them away. Believe me when I say for most mothers out there - these are liquid gold. And the most precious thing we can give. So in sadness I told them about what happened. The concierge immediately apologized, immediately tried to ask what can they do, or help with. I said nothing, I cannot refreeze them. No joke, i had about 50oz worth thats damaged.Now - they sent me after that an email apologizing again. They gave me a voucher worth significant enough to stay for a night in any FS or to use it against room and food. But what made it more actionable for me was asking, do I remember who I gave the milk to and when - because they want to ensure it never happened again to anyone.

The location is nice, on the east side midtown, you can get to everything. The Room Service is PHENOMENAL. The bath is fantastic - water pressure to die for. The staff helpful.

This is one that will not seriously disappoint you, and if you're having a great time in the city it will not get in the way in any fashion.

They apologized and offered us complimentary drinks at the bar while we waited. When we checked into our room we noticed it had a cigarette smell. I was also very disappointed that my white coat had gotten pen on it while it was transported by the bellmen. Additionally our supposed ""quiet room"" was across from the housekeeping closet. We had limited time to get ready for our evening so we notified the staff about my coat and hoped the smell would go away. When we returned that night we were pleased that my coat had been taken away and we received an amenity of fruit and wine. The next day the cigarette smell remained in our room. We notified the front desk and were provided with an air purifier machine. We kept the machine running for the remainder of our trip but the smell continued. It was very unusual to stay in a five star hotel and have a Honeywell air purifier machine going the whole time. No one checked on us about the smell. My coat did return cleaned.

I have stayed at the one in Central Park and Battery Park. I wanted to switch it up for once. The interior of the hotel was very nice. My junior suite was very beautiful. However, they definitely want to rob you for every penny you're worth, though you're already paying $1200 a night. So, at every Ritz I have ever stayed at, they give you a bunch of little water bottles. Here, every time you ORDER bottled water, they charge you $8 for one that contains 3-4 sips or $11 for one that contained 9-10 sips. Maybe the water was made of gold? I must've been missing something. Also, we got breakfast: an omelette, some egg combo, and a pot of coffee. $150. Two pieces of cheesecake that had maybe four bites to them each and some water: $85. Normally, when you stay at a hotel that charges these kinds of prices, they are very accommodating. Also, we got tickets for a broadway show on the wrong night and the concierge helped us get ones for the right night. However, we still had to pay for the other tickets. When we talked to the box office, they said that through ticketmaster (which is where the tickets were purchased), you can easily just exchange your tickets in about three easy steps. They even gave us a piece of paper with the basic details of how to go about this. The concierge told us that the only guarantee we could have would be buying new tickets and then trying to get a refund from the box office. Well, that wasn't the case, and we wished we had known that before having to purchase totally brand new tickets. Overall, the staff was friendly and the hotel was nice, but there are much better, more accommodating places to stay in New York. The best part is that most other places don't charge for water!

The location is the best location you can find in Mid Town, the service is impeccable, the staff are amazing, and the room size and furniture is great. Great room service, and great attention to details. The above has mostly not changed, however, since the hotel changed ownership a year or two ago, the room categories has now changed, and the new policy is to call every room category now a ""suite"". this has led the hotel to increase their rates on pretty much identical rooms, and not be able to offer their regulars simple preferences such as high floor or balcony/terrace. I used to always get the same room with a balcony, but now have been told that this is a higher category (although the same size if not smaller than a normal room). I think this is unfair, and somewhat greedy, and in a way has changed my whole experience to what used to be the finest hotel in NYC. I would still recommend this hotel for its location, its great service and staff, but definitely no longer for their personalization of the experience, nor is it the same value for money it used to be.",,dehays2018,6,3.0

No bed dress down service, no chocolate, nothing. Even the toiletries were rationed out as if there was a shortage. The beds and the bed linen were, however, fabulous. Ditto the water pressure in the showers.The food at breakfast couldn’t be faulted either; but again, no extras, no buffet and just a single course with a cup of coffee for two produced a bill that was $130+.The bar was lively and always full but very few bar snacks worth having so in the evenings we were reduced to looking for elsewhere to eat when in fact, after a day trawling through New York streets sightseeing, we were ready for an early night in the hotel.The staff were excellent and couldn't be faulted.All in all, a disappointment.

The staff at the front door met us warmly (the same could not be said of one of the front desk staff) and the lobby looked grand.However, once you step into your room, it is like stepping into a budget hotel. To give it credit, the room was huge by NYC standards, but the room was unbelievably sparse and cheaply furnished - it felt like one had stepped into Comfort Suites. The only thing nice was the big plasma TV.There was a tasteless cheap sofa and just two magazines - not even a Time Out or similar kind of publication for things to do. And we were actually in a junior suite.There was no kettle, no coffee machine, no bottled water. For the price of their rooms, this is surely not too much to ask for. I asked for an iron and ironing board when I checked in and it only arrived 90 mins later - after about 5 phone calls frantically chasing for it as I was late for an appointment. I walk into my bathroom to find used toiletries. After complaining, I was replenished with two bigger bottles that also looked a fifth used! The same thing happened with my other travel companions in their respective rooms. The more we brought this up with them, the more bottles arrived - but always with some that weren't full. Another travel companion had green water coming out of the pipes when she tried to fill her bath. We also tried the spa, which had one tiny shower and not much facilities working. The jacuzzi was empty. When I tried to give the therapist a tip, I was told they had no change and I had to go to the reception to get my own change - not the service standards I expect from a Four Seasons!When I mentioned the problems at check out, the front desk staff took note and said they would get back to me. It's been several days now, not even an email of apology.Obviously they do not pride themselves on their service standards at this Four Seasons.

We flew in for the weekend from DFW specifically for my birthday present to see Bette Midler in Hello Dolly. The room and amenities (we have two kids) were excellent as always. However, I must point out the BEST that this hotel has to offer. ""Milton"" at the Tree Restaurant. We had lunch and breakfast. He was a gem. We brought our two tween daughters and he not only engaged them, but also told them the interpretation of their names from his ethnicity. He got to know us very well in the short time we had at lunch. The next morning at breakfast, he called us each by the correct name and remembered what we were going to do that day. He had the two tables next to ours and obviously was just as endearing with them. He engaged us with the table next to us (they had seen Hello Dolly the day before). What a wonderful person you have! He deserves a promotion and huge bonus. You have an incredible ambassador for your brand.

To the right is their all day restaurant with waiters there for 24 years or longer just waiting to make your experience the best. Certainly you pay for it but breakfast here truly is a treat.Rooms are newly renovated in the Four Seasons motif. I had a junior suite with enough closet space and drawers to stay a month. You know the bed is fab and one reason to stay here. The only thing missing in the room was complimentary water. Service is as you would expect-anything at anytime. I checked out the spa and fitness center in the lower basement (5 levels below ground level). Fitness center well equipped and spacious. Spa is on the small side. Treatments rooms very small and a bit noisy (I think due to the plumbing in the ceiling) but my massage therapist was in the top 10 percentile (Annie).

First, the positive: They have at last upgraded the rooms, which are lovely but for three things. One, there is no chair with an ottoman so the only place to put your feet up is to sit on the bed. Two, they have put artificial flowers for n the rooms (and in the restaurant), something I cannot image Isadore Sharp ever allowing. Three, the toilets have never cleared on one flush and they still don't. Another flaw is that the bathrooms have only one sink. That's always been true, but they didn't change it. The other positive is the staff that have been there for years. They are like family, and they know us and take great care of us. The biggest negative for me is Ty's Bar. In the past the main bar was on 58th Street. That was closed maybe two years ago to be turned into banquet space. The old Ty's, which was a great quiet space with a terrific light dinner menu, was heaven. You could actually talk to people there. And you could come in from a late flight and get a great light meal with a great glass of wine. Perfect. The new Ty's Bar was first done with bright red seats and as many chrome with black tops tables as they could cram in. A nightmare. Loud, raucous music. And, a Bites menu, not a light dinner menu. You can't even get a burger. I've noticed that it's mostly empty when I've been there. And I know why. Also, some staff who were great were let go when the change was made. There is no evening option for a meal other than room service. The Garden is still open for breakfast and lunch, and it is still good with the staff I've known so long. I noticed, though, that the cords for the lights on the trees are hanging loose, another thing Isadore Sharp never would have countenanced. And there are artificial flowers in the big arrangements. At a Four Seasons?!?!?! The other thing that grates is the total commercializations of all the spaces. High-end hotels do display the wares of fine shops in the area. But this takes it to a new level. Every space is an ad or a shop. The jewelry shop at the top of the 58th Street entrance has been closed at least since we were there in April. A great painting used to hang there. The handbags on sale in the lobby didn't seem to be there this weekend. The hotel is owned by Ty Warner who made his money on Beanie Babies. I have no animus toward Beanie Babies, but displaying them in the lobby of a Four Seasons just seems way off key. Overall, the place just feels like something is off. I hate to say it because I have loved the place. But, like many things, it has changed. We just checked in to the Four Seasons in Georgetown, and, blissfully, the lobby isn't full of ads. There is art and good taste, and I feel like I'm in a Four Seasons again. ","Irvine, California","Roberta A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Irvine, California</strong>",39,3.0

Beautiful updating of this lovely hotel with rich but soothing fabrics and a very clean line throughout the room. For those who have stayed here in the past you will notice that the bathrooms have remained the same which feels particularly dated given the room refresh, but not a big deal.I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the staff. Unfortunately no refresh here. The Four Seasons New York has always had a staff that was comfortable being indifferent to its guests. You will notice the same now. Yes there are always exceptions. But pay attention to the door staff on their mobile phones who open the door for you 50% of the time because they are too busy with the screens to notice. If you have bags that you don't wish to carry yourself, the door staff will have their hand out when you step out of the taxi and then somebody new will have their hand out when they bring the bags to your room. Same in reverse when you leave. The front desk staff is uneven--some nice, some act like you are inconveniencing them with your request. Is it tolerable? Probably, for the rooms alone, at least once. Can anything be done about the indifferent service? With great effort. New York is not a place that attracts those really interested in serving. One will find similar attitudes at the Loews and the Palace and the Mandarin. The Ritz Central Park and downtown somehow have managed to attract or create staff with a service ethos. When it comes to service you don't get what you pay for at the Four Seasons New York.

More recently I've become acclimatised to a more conveniently located, slightly less expensive, 5 star mid town hotel which has a nice friendly and busy vibe, but on my most recent trip this was full for my dates so I was happy to revisit 4 seasons. I have to say, though, I was underwhelmed. Staff friendly, accommodating, and solicitous but the hotel seemed to me to lack a certain warmth. There's been work done to the interior entrance, restaurant and bar. But It feels dark impersonal and foreboding, like a Tim Burton Batman movie. I had to use my iPhone torch to select a glass of wine from the menu. My secretary made a booking via a booking agency, so not directly, and on arrival I distinctly felt treated like a second class citizen in terms of room allocation, being assigned to a perfectly ok room on a lower floor but with no obvious view (one of the pluses of staying at the hotel). Breakfast Menu poorly configured and expensive, gym disappointing. And a last bugbear of mine , 5 star hotels with air conditioning in the summer really should provide plenty of free bottled water as a matter of course. This was grudging.

Of course, you are at the flagship property for the Four Seasons, so it may not be entirely unexpected to pay high prices. The best thing about the Four Seasons, New York is, well most everything. The standouts were the service and the interior design of the hotel public areas and the rooms. We were in a Junior Suite priced at $870 per night (not including all of those NYC taxes).

There was a construction going on while I was there but no staff ever told me about it, I woke up due to the noise for 2 days before I called and found out what was going on. PLUS there was a renovation or something going on right outside my room, and I can smell the paint. Yet they didn't bother to let me know before I called them.  They managed to change the room for me to a upper level and apologized. But it is too late for that. I literally don't think they just ""forgot"" to tell me. Plus the old room looks right into an office in another building, you can literally see each other's face. If you want natural light then forget about privacy.

The front desk staff were outstanding; very friendly, efficient and professional. It was nice of the Four Seasons to upgrade my room...it is funny how those little things can really make your day! For NYC I found The hotel to be very elegant and modern. There are a lot of great names in NYC and I have had the pleasure to stay at quite a number of them but most have simply seen better days and, while full of character, need to renovated. Not the case with this property. The suite I had was spacious (especially for NYC), clean and generally well laid out. Lots of automation built into the room which was nice. The bedroom area was tastefully appointed and there was a very large flat panel tv that was perfect.The thing about a great hotel isn't really the rooms (I believe that a nice, clean, bright room with a top notch bathroom should be at every 4 or 5 star property)...it is the staff. Here is where this property excelled and stands out as a 5 star property in my opinion.I pay a lot of attention to how staff interact and treat guests during my stays...every person I encountered made eye contact and greeted me (sometimes by name) and it wasn't a fake corporate 'hello' it felt genuine. Also, the staff were always so helpful. From the doorman who lent me an umbrella, to the room service staff who got my meal to me in 25 min (I was running late) to the entire staff at their outstanding spa...everyone was friendly, helpful and seemed to really care that I was a guest...just outstanding!The only suggestion I would make is that I think a four season (or any 4/5 star property) should have a keurig type coffee machine in the room along with a few bottles of complimentary water. These tiny things were noticeable absent at this property.All in all, This property is a must stay if you are headed to NYC!Keep up the great work!","Morton Grove, Illinois","AlanH1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morton Grove, Illinois</strong>",111,5.0

As time has gone on, I've watched the hotel become dated and less and less compelling relative to the other high end options in NYC. The service was still great and the location cannot be beat, but other elements were really showing their age: furniture, bathrooms, room technology, room service food options. Also the absence of a real restaurant that serves dinner is a big negative. What five star hotel doesn't have a restaurant or a proper bar? The only thing open at night is a sports lounge that is frequently loud and unwelcoming. Not that the hotel became bad, it just wasn't worth the $700-800/night that it charged, particularly relative to the new Park Hyatt next door or the new Four Seasons Downtown. Once the hotel began renovating, I stayed away from the noise, but had very high hopes for a renaissance.Having come back to the hotel post renovation, I am quite disappointed. To truly appreciate it, I booked the Gotham Junior Suite to see what the hotel was really like. I was in for a rude awakening. The hotel used the renovation as an excuse to relabel all their rooms. My ""Gotham suite"" was no different than a regular deluxe room from before. Same room, fancier name, but now a much higher price! This is deceit pure and simple. Moreover, the renovation is extremely underwhelming -- purely cosmetic. They changed carpets, furniture, wallpaper, and mirrors, and may be the TV. They didn't change any technology in the room (still can't open curtains from bed, for instance, or turn off the lights), and they didn't upgrade anything of substance. They didn't put double vanities even in their higher end ""junior suites"" -- this is pretty standard at this price range. Bathrooms are actually entirely untouched -- same as they looked 15 years ago. They also didn't reopen any restaurants or improve their room service menus. Other than a cosmetic revamp of the rooms, they changed very little. Even cosmetically they didn't get it right -- they kept a lot of the old wood trim, which now clashes with the new panels they installed. Very clear that they were pinching pennies in this ""renovation"" and doing as little as possible to claim that the hotel was renovated.So what do we have? A somewhat renovated hotel, with good service, bad food, still very much behind the times. And now at $1100 to $1400 per night. I don't mind paying for the best. But this simply isn't.","San Francisco, California","SFTraveller101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",149,2.0

The floor is not sloped towards the drain, so shower water floods the entire bathroom and even gets to the edge of the room's carpeted floor. Water pools around the toilet and elsewhere, making it slippery to make your way around after a shower. Exactly what you don't need in an accessible bathroom. The hotel is aware of the problem. It appears that their renovation contractor botched the floors in all their accessible rooms. They tried to patch the issue by adding a lip at the shower entrance, but that was useless in our room. The best we could do was to arrange 4-5 towels like sand bags around the shower. Until they pull up the bathroom floors and grind them down to drain properly, I will not return to this property if I need an accessible room again.Other than this issue with the room, the hotel was great. Staff is phenomenal. Location is great. Would not hesitate to stay here if I needed a normal room.","Dana Point, California","JoeA272</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dana Point, California</strong>",6,1.0

Look, I've stayed in a bunch of NYC hotels but somehow never stayed in this hotel. From now on, despite being a fairly loyal Ritz Carlton frequenter, I will stay at this hotel.When you walk into the lobby, you don't have any of the dissonance you find at the Ritz Carlton Central Park (although the Battery Park location is better). It is quiet and more subdued.One of the only drawbacks of the Four Seasons is walking up the steps as soon as you enter the lobby, but that's really the only negative of the place.The staff is very friendly, very accommodating. Can't do enough for you. The Concierge desk is excellent, and I must applaud Tina particularly for her help in ever-changing restaurant reservations.The room is flawless. Clean, spacious (in NYC!) and quiet. The HVAC system is quiet, the noise from the street subdued because the streets aren't that busy. Sure, I had some noisy people next door playing some kind of music but even that was manageable.Location is terrific. Very well situated.

At first we were offered a suite of a lower category - without a terrace, though the latter was of primary importance. We were a party of 3 people so for a night we were placed in 2 standart terrace rooms on a lower floor with no view (one room couldn't accomodate all of us). I worte a complaint to our agency and to the general director of the hotel. The next day we were offered to choose (free of charge) suites of the same category in different 5 star hotels but after checking the options we have decided to remain in Four Seasons. As a compensation we got substantial discount on both rooms + breakfast inclusion + limousine for saturday night and numerous minor gifts. Overall this was a satisfactory compensation fot the mistake made. About the hotel - location is perfect - in the very heart of Manhattan, very convenient. Concierge service - perfect. All requests were handled immediately and very effectively. It was a pity not to have the planned suite, since the view should have been just amazing. Will be happy to come again to live there. From the negative side - extremely expensive breakfast with horrible service. If not included in the room, better not to go there. One of the worst breakfasts I ever had.
