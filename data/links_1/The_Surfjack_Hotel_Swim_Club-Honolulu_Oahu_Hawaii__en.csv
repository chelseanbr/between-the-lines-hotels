Because we live in Hawaii, we got free upgrades so each stay was in a suite instead of just a room. The decor is retro surf which makes it infinitely instagrammable and the bottom of the pool even looks like a retro postcard saying ""Wish you were here!"" The restaurant is truly a gem and you won't want to miss breakfast. There is an adobo pork egg dish that we had to get every morning and even at night, the food was amazing. The bartenders and staff are very helpful and attentive but not overbearing. Our friend booked one of the penthouses and let me tell you, THOSE are the rooms you want if you can afford it.

We selected it because it seemed like for what you get, the price point was amazing. The location was also extremely walkable, and close enough to Waikiki beach.Everyone who works here is really friendly, so service is top notch. Loved getting to know Karissa and Hideki (2 of the bartenders) – and they made me some amazing off-menu cocktails when I needed them. Yes, Mahina & Suns can be a bit pricey, but pretty comparable for hotels in the area. The rooms are nice, and the bed comfortable. I loved the decor and vibe the hotel brought - and of course that pool is super insta-famous. My husband was able to work out of the couches/cabanas adjacent to the pool, and the free coffee in the morning was nice. Suggestions on other amenities that would add some extra vibes: bathrobes, body lotion (I never use it, but of course the one time I needed it), laundry machines/or laundry service. My ONLY real gripe was that our room was situated next to a corner suite on the 4th floor. You literally could hear every word that was coming out of someones mouth if they were the room next to the adjoining door. The 1st family next to us started their day at 4-5AM, had 2 young children who were constantly getting yelled a, and a noisy alarm. The next family had a very young baby, who cried every couple of hours. Oh....and there was a group of girls on the other side of us, who partied until 2am, and when someone called security, they knocked on OUR room, and I had to get out of bed to answer it and point them in the other direction. Then I spent the next hour trying to fall back asleep ... and the girls didn't even shut up :( I wear earplugs for all of these reasons, but they didn't help much because it's just the nature of the restored motel rooms.","San Francisco, California","karyssamidori</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",0,4.0

Honolulu can be one of the best places in the world to see that old blue Hawaii feeling! The Surfjack did not disappoint in anyway. The staff were lovely the swimming pool fantastic the whole look and feel of the place is exactly what I was expecting! Be sure to rent the free bicycles and also take the mid century modern walking tour it is self guided but the map is great. This hotel is right in the mix of things downtown you were just a few minutes walk from Waikiki Beach! There is lots of great shopping and good food locations nearby. They also provide some great recommendations in the booklet in your room. I found the staff to be helpful and friendly. I wish the valet parking was explained better on the website that was a bit of a surprise. I think $35 a night for people who are staying there is a little steep.

From the minute I walked into Surfjack, I wished we could have stayed there, and once I looked at my final Airbnb bill with all the charges, I realized that Surfjack would have cost the same or less. So, we booked our next business trip with Surfjack for three nights. Love the friendly staff, the pool courtyard, the shaded areas for informal meetings, the restaurant.

After reviewing the rooms on line, we opted for the penthouse. here is what we liked and what could improve:1. the lobby and the service of all of the amenities in the public spaces are exactly what we liked about the property. not overly crowded; plenty of nooks and hideaways in the surrounding lanai areas; wonderful food in the restaurant; live music; movies by the pool, etc. Our only negative about this part of the review was that the pool should be heated in the winter months. It was very chilly. 2. the penthouse was sized appropriately and the view from the over-sized terrace was terrific. However, we both felt that they need to do some maintenance here. the terrace wood slats are in need of replacement as they have weathered and broken in places. The two chaise lounges both are in need of replacement as they did not function well and were broken in their ability to recline properly. The room itself was decorated quite attractively - in the mid-century style of the property, but a couple of pieces of the furniture were in need of repair. The room was musty smelly, buy my spouse went and bought a candle at the ABC store on the corner and that helped out quite a bit.And, the bathroom sink would not drain without an extended period of time given, which was a challenge when you were brushing your teeth.However, in spite of the challenges with their maintenance and replacement of older pieces, the room was sized appropriately and furnished with enough amenities to be rated ok.There is a property amenity fee, but we felt that it was a reasonable price for what you received. However, my view on amenity fees is that they should go away and be incorporated into the room price. They are an annoyance that does not engender warm wishes. I would rather have a posted price $29 higher and know that whatever i needed to use from the resort was included. My opinion of this hotel is that it is charming in a bohemian, gypset way - especially the first floor public space, but that the room we stayed in had the feel of too many parties without the necessary refreshing of the space. It might be that our experiences in other types of properties around the world of similar design and vibe have skewed us here, but we enjoyed our stay even though we wished the room had inspired us more.",,Travel42790049309,1,4.0

I did not feel the warmth and willingness to help from the staff. If anything, they seemed quite indifferent. We asked for recommendations a couple of times and the staff on duty could not come up with much. When we arrived, we were struggling to get our bags our of the car and the staff member just sat there and looked at us and did not offer to help. On many occasions, we would enter or leave the hotel without even a greeting for the exception of Sai. Thank you Sai for your warm welcome. The room was big enough for our family of 4 with plenty of storage. It was though extremely dusty. Not sure when our room was last dusted. We checked the same areas every day and the same dust balls were there .Quite alarming considering we were there for 10 days. The shower recess was disgusting. The glass needed a good clean and the floor inside the shower recess needed a good scrub. Also, quite concerning. It was mentioned to reception and it was cleaned once. The leaking tap on the sink was also mentioned to reception. Someone came up and tightened it but did not fix the leak which made a big mess on the sink every day.The location of the hotel is fantastic as it is within walking distance from the centre and a short walk to the beach. We ate at the restaurant once and the food was extremely delicious. Hotel management might want to install some soft closing fixtures on its doors as the doors to the rooms slam shut every time someone comes in or goes out. Not enjoyable when you are on holidays and might want the occasional sleep in. Please do something about that strong smell coming out of the bottom toilets. It is intoxicating in a bad way. The lemon water in the lobby was very enjoyable. The $25 per night resort fee (ex tax) is pure highway robbery. The only thing of value to this resort fee is the $10 per night restaurant credit, Everything else that they are offering for the $25, would be offered for free at other hotels.

A special shout out to Sai on the front desk who made us feel extra welcome and gave us tips for not paying too much for a cab and other great advice. We splurged and booked a suite which had a separate living room which was fabulous and we would highly recommend this for some extra space. There is heaps of cupboard space and the bed was really comfortable. A favourite for us was the handy little garment steamer - so much better than an iron! The bathroom was retro and really nice with just enough lighting. Housekeeping (especially Charie) was lovely, leaving us little notes every day wishing us a good day. The poolside bar and restaurant was superb. We ate there one night and the Ahi dish and the pasta dish were both super yummy! The property is located a few streets back from the beach which was great as far as we were concerned as it was less busy. They let you take the pool towels with you when you go out each day which was handy. There is an ABC store (convenience store) on the corner and a bus stop across the road so it's really convenient. They have live music every evening, and a film night once a week using the big screen above the pool. The property is family friendly, but kids aren't allowed in the pool after 5:30pm when it becomes adults only which was nice. Overall we really liked this property and will definitely stay here when we go back to Oahu/Hawaii.One thing to note is the system where the daily amenities charge (a USA thing) is not charged at the time of booking, but put onto your credit card on arrival along with a pre-authorisation of $300 for incidentals. We were staying 7 nights so this totaled $550 which maxed out our debit card.

It’s not huge. Staff people are friendly. The lobby is open to the street, pool and bar area.

I like that they have fresh brewed coffee in the bar area in the morning. You can sit near the pool or take it to your room. I am big in to saving the environment so really appreciate the big bottles of shampoo, conditioner and body soap in the bathrooms. I LOVE that the hotel provides reef safe sunscreen by the pool. I wish more places would do that. We were in a two bedroom unit. It is spacious but our bedroom has a door that can connect to the room next door to make it a three bedroom. The door is not thick enough to keep the noise out. We could hear all conversations, television, alarms going off, papers shuffling - everything. It sounds like it’s only one door. It needs two and maybe some sound damper in between. I spoke to the desk upon check out. They said they are working on sound dampening.

Away from the hustle and bustle of beach front life our lovely room was quiet, clean and modern. There is a relaxed home away from home vibe which we really loved. The bed was so big and comfortable. Personally we would not choose The Surfjack if I we were staying with children - it has more of an adults only vibe.Loved the AC and ceiling fans, lots of power outlets including built in USB ports. The bathroom was very spacious with a huge shower. We requested a kettle and found this to be fantastic as we were able to enjoy a cuppa in our PJs. If you are a coffee or hot chocolate person then Olive and Oliver is the place to go. We were not fans of Mahina and Sun's - wait staff didn't really impress and a bit too high end for our liking. You do get a daily $10 dinner only credit for Mahina and Sun's. We saved ours up until the last night and had dinner for two at no charge.Laundry was a challenge. We used the iDo Laundry on Kaʻiulani Ave. A small drying rack in the room would have been so helpful.The hotel staff were lovely and housekeeping looked after us so well. We always left a tip if we had our room made up and in return got a lovely handwritten note of thanks. We would have found an envelope marked ""For Housekeeping"" helpful to leave a tip in as we had to write a note telling them the money was for them.The Surfjack was the icing on the cake as far as we were concerned and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.",,Jamd1,0,5.0

The only issue I have with the hotel is that the housekeeping staff is SO loud. They are literally shouting at each other from across the halls. It’s just irritating if you want to rest quietly in your room. The one other downside is the waitress at the restaurant who needs a lesson on hospitality and service.

At the SurfJack you can get a perfectly cooked risotto or seared Ahi Tuna fillet all fresh and not smothered in salt and butter. Each night they have a local musician playing by the pool and they have a big screen above the pool where they play classic old surf movies, you can sit there with a cocktail and watch Elvis surfing.

We needed an overnight, so I chose the Surfjack. It was perfect. Small, low-key yet hip with a fun personality that wasn't serious and pretentious, like some other recent Honolulu stays (I'm looking at you, Modern!) The Surfjack has a postcard perfect retro pool at the heart of its outdoor living room. This is not the mega-waterfall tiki-torched pools of big resort hotels but a friendly intimate hangout with cool music and a great happy hour menu from 2PM. The Surfjack isn't trying to wow you with expensive crazy over the top decor. The Surfjack inspires you to chill the heck out.

The staff was amazing, every step of our trip was seamless and easy. The valet team was especially helpful, I really will miss them. They provided tips for where to go and what to do. Some of their suggestions ended up being the highlights of our days. We enjoyed the adjacent coffee shop and restaurant; the baristas and bartenders were quick and very friendly and the drinks were delicious.Overall, you can tell the hotel has old bones and is a bit creaky, but the recent renovations are really beautiful. You feel like you're in a trendy, tropical oasis, perfectly instagrammable in every way. The pool was clean, well-sized and never too crowded; we spent a lot of time there. We were lucky to get a balcony overlooking the pool and enjoyed nightly snacks and drinks there while people-watching—the silent disco was especially entertaining. Nightly local musicians really added a nice ambience to the evenings.Mahina & Suns had delicious fries and cocktails at very reasonable happy-hour prices and was conveniently located near the pool. Their dinner was expensive, but with our $10/night credits we got a good meal with some drool-worthy pizza and a tasty sampler of their more popular menu items. I definitely suggest the pizza...and the fries. I do wish we had tried brunch.Olive & Oliver is really trendy—those little illustrated coffee cups!!!—and I loved looking at all the beautiful things they sell. Everything was a bit too expensive for me, but fun to look at while waiting for my espresso to extract. The pastries at the coffee shop were amazing—the banana bread in particular. I did wish they had some Hawaiian-grown and roasted coffee on tap. Some gently suggested improvements (because overall we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and these were minor things we noticed that would have put our experien over the top):-Serve coffee earlier; ideally at 5:30 to get the early-risers trying to catch the sunrise.-Consider adding white noise machines? (Lots of stomping in the room above.)-Hangers / storage for wet towels, clothes, and sandy beach stuff outside-A full-length mirror in the room-Allow kids to swim later. We definitely would have enjoyed many drinks (and fries) by the pool in the evening while our daughter swam.-Recycling in the room / facility-Beach toys for rent (big plus for sustainability.)Lastly, if you meet the zebra dove with only one toe on each foot, his name is Deuce and he likes the fries.",,imapiggy,3,5.0

I expected a hip-retro vibe and that’s what Surfjack delivers. Unfortunately, it’s only done fairly and some opportunities are missed along the way. The one bedroom suite is smaller than many standard hotel rooms. Frustratingly, the layout is so strange that the door to the closet doesn’t open all the way because it hits the day-bed.The bathroom is located in the bedroom, literally right next to the bed..awkward even for couples who are close. Service is a little indifferent -had to ask for help with 2 large suitcases. And our one trip to the bar determined that there’s no blender for a pina colada or similar. I guess they’re too hip.Small pool with only a few lounge chairs...so good luck there..for a place billed as a “swim club” we managed to never make it to the pool.Location is excellent and the value is superior. It really is a boutique hotel that seems to want to give off that retro-cool feeling.And the “resort fee” of $20 is super annoying. It isn’t a resort. There are no facilities to speak of. Dear management—please just add the ridiculous fee to the room rate so we know what we have to pay and do t feel nickel and dimes..OR provide some amenities to make it feel like there’s actually something received for said fee. It’s nkt fair to Surfjack—all hotels seem to do it, I just couldn’t figure out what it was for other than use of the pool which seems as though it should be included in the rate.Didn’t try the restaurant. No room service either although they’ll bring some continental thing to you on the morning.4stars for location, effort and value.","Vancouver, Canada","jeffreylowy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

The shower had a good waterfall-like spray and there was enough room for the two of us. When we got to the hotel, we were a bit early and the room wasn’t ready but the staff were very nice and it gave us a chance to wander around Waikiki for an hour. The Mahina and Sons restaurant was really great - expensive but the food was good quality. Meals are generally so much bigger than in Australia so I was happy to have the smaller meals at the restaurant some mornings and nights. The bar and wait staff were very lovely! And the Olive and Oliver cafe adjacent to the hotel had the best coffee in Honolulu! The hotel was a few streets back from the beaches and I think that’s a plus - there are interesting shops and restaurants around it and a convenient ABC Shop two doors down. There’s also a gay bar next door which was a cool surprise. The staff helped us rent a car, and the valet dude were also really nice and very quick.

The magazines, macadamia cookies, handwritten note, tote bag, lime infused cold water to refill your drink bottles, delicious smelling toiletries, all make you appreciate the effort made in making this feel like your home away from home. The restaurant on-site serves delicious fresh food that we struggled to find anything better. However it is in a great location of lots of local amenities.

We emailed the hotel direct and queried the best room and deal they could get us and they did not disappoint. Definitely recommend dealing with them direct! We arrived at the hotel very early in the morning after an overnight flight from Auckland looking very tired but excited, the team were amazing from then onward - letting us rest on their couch, getting us cookies and coffee, and sorting out an early check in. The stay was amazing, such a warm, friendly, relaxing environment. We loved the vibes from just the feel of the hotel, to the staff who were always so friendly and helpful, for example they always went out of their way to answer our queries or sort issues, our swipe key stopped working one day and it was no issue, had a new one in a few seconds. Housekeeping also left us a welcome note on our arrival and a goodbye and thank you note on our last day. The room was a perfect mixture of modern and vintage, I had heard stories before of some of the very old hotels in Honolulu looking alright outside but worn down inside with bad bathrooms. This is 100% not the case here, the rooms feel very modern with modern bathrooms and fittings. The downstairs restaurant and pool area was wonderful, with drinks and bar snacks that can be purchased in the pool area. For some people they might not like the pool being in such a public area (the restaurant, pool, lobby are all in one area and it is the ground floor which does have doors that open out onto the road) but I never even noticed or thought about it. I thought the whole layout was nice and a real cool vibe. The other highlights were the store and coffee shop Olive and Oliver, we went for drinks there almost every day the staff were friendly and the coffee good. There was also free coffee available in the pool area every morning that we enjoyed every morning. The location is great, a quick walk to the beach and loads of shops, restaurants and bars. We didn't want to leave! I would 100% recommend this spot for anyone young wanting a relaxed, unique hotel to stay at in Waikiki. It is definitely a boutique hotel, so don't go expecting one of those big massive chain hotels - expect amazing friendly staff, live music every night, great coffee, and the perfect location and pool for your instagram story.","Auckland, New Zealand","hannahjulieh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",0,5.0

The building and location are great; really close to the beach, restaurants, and shopping. The rates for what the rooms are cannot be beat. If you sign up for their insider rewards, you save even more. What really makes this place stand above and beyond any other hotel we've ever stayed at (on the island and on the mainland) is the staff. They embody the spirit of aloha and are always there to help with a smile on their face.Sai at the front desk is the always the first smiling face we see when we visit. He's always helpful, efficient, and has the BEST cookies for our boys. No matter where we were in the lobby, Mahina & Suns or Olive & Oliver (amazing coffee), he never failed to say good morning. Tiki and Whitney also went out of their way to make sure that we got to stay in the same room when we decided to extend our stay for another night.This last stay really reinforced why we stay at the Surfjack. It was after this visit, we decided we will never stay in any other hotel in Waikiki; all in thanks to two valets: Keola and Michael. My husband parked our rental car on a street that was a tow zone for a block of three hours (he did not read any signage). When we walked to the car to start our day, we found it was missing. When we got back to the hotel, we asked if Keola knew the number to call, he expressed his genuine shock and sympathy to our situation. I was sitting in the lobby with my two boys (4 and 1) while my husband called the tow company. Keola came to find us and volunteered to bring us to the tow yard to retrieve our vehicle. And that is exactly what he did. Michael would have brought us, but I think it was his turn to man the valet counter. They did not have to offer such a kindness, nor do they do it for everyone. My family and I cannot express the gratitude that we have for Kealoha and Michael for saving our day and turning it into one of the best days we had in Hawaii.Thank you Surfjack for the amazing stay. Thank you Sai, Tiki and Whitney for your graciousness. Thank you Kealoha and Michael for your kindness and generosity.

We don't naturally gravitate towards luxury, because in the end we prefer a space with good vibes amid equal parts interesting design and comfort. Oh and we are suckers for mid-century modern aesthetics. The Surfjack did not disappoint on any of those fronts. The room decor is impeccable. In some ways it is more like a old-school motel in its layout. However unlike a motel, the restaurant and poolside areas are true amenities. Mahina and Sons has a full breakfast/brunch menu, a menu for poolside bites, and a superb dinner menu. Everything we ordered was really good. We let the hotel staff know that we were on our honeymoon, and they generously upgraded our room to one with a huge balcony plus sent up a bottle of bubbly. No coffeemakers in the rooms, but the complimentary coffee by the pool was worth the trip down. Olive and Oliver is a cute boutique and coffee bar. Perfect for a high-end souvenirs. Lewers Street is quiet and doesn't get all the extreme foot traffic of Kuhio or Kalkaua, but plenty is within walking distance.

For the $425 per night price we paid, it was absolutely not worth the cost. It's fun and trendy if that's your bag, but even breakfast had poor service and they charged $2 extra to get regular syrup for the pancakes for my son, because he didn't want the butter/banana syrup.

Surfjack is a perfectly fine hotel and my experience might have been much better given different circumstances. The review rating of this hotel is mainly a result of comparing with our first hotel.Surfjack's location is good, it's in a quiet neighbourhood of the town centre and easy to walk to Waikiki beach, restaurants and shops. I chose Surfjack because I wanted a more local Hawaiian and surfer's feel and I expected a cool, laid back, friendly vibe.When we checked in, the front desk person ran through the list of things point by point without much of a smile. That wasn't a good start. Overall during our 2 nights' stay I didn't feel much of the friendliness of the hotel staff. The best experience of service I had at Surfjack was the security guard which took care of the Saturday evening performance. I had a good chat with him, he explained how the music performance is conducted (it's not a regular setting of singing band or DJ, you'd have to see it for yourself) and why that came about. He was personable, friendly and always had a smile.

A welcome drink- choice of fresh juices or coffee. We opted for the iced coffee. It is a cute hotel a couple blocks from the main Waikiki drag. Seriously the location was perfect as it was far enough from the noise but within walking distance of the turquoise blue sea. We were lucky enough to receive a complimentary upgrade to a 2 bedroom suite ob the corner of the 3 rd floor. I felt like we had our own little apartment in the middle of honolulu. With a pool view, that the tile on the pool floor reads “ wish you were here” was beyond beautiful. We each had our own king size bed and were very comfortable. The balcony had chairs so we could sit and relax. It was my friends birthday which was noted when reservation was made that this thoughtful hotel delivered a bottle of champagne on ice, and a hand written note. We enjoyed Happy Hour in the bar and Lilly was super friendly and helpful. She was a great bartender. The Naked Pig Pizza was a perfect snack. They have complimentary coffee in the morning served poolside. A peaceful, laid back funky with character and a positive surfer vibe. We were satisfied and would return.

We were also surprised by a $25/day facility fre upon check out. We ate in the restaurant for breakfast but they didn't have enough servers for all the tables which meant we had to order take out despite being in the restaurant. This meant we wasted a ton of packaging but also the food was cold when it arrived (again we were sitting in the restaurant waiting). We charged the bill to the room but upon paying found they had added a ln extra $15 to the meal, either automatically giving themselves a 33% tip for refusing to serve our table or miss charging.

I have to admit I was expecting more of an Ace Hotel style vibe (but obvi smaller & island style) ... just because of its mid century swank & instagramable cuteness! What we got was, I think, a pretty good value for a place in Waikiki, AMAZING STAFF (literally everyone was delightful!) and a few things I didn’t bargain for that I’m throwing out just in case they matter to you. 1. The room was small and the bed was too. Bed was full size, I believe and we could feel the springs in it. Room was decorated well and we had a great view of the pool! The small room and bed didn’t suck- but it wasn’t a wow either. 2. There are loads of families and kids. During our stay, it seems almost exclusively families and kids in the pool! Everyone was great and kiddos were fine. But I think I had expected a bit more of a chic adult vibe. 3. Parking is $35 a day and there is an additional $25 a day mandatory to use their bag, towels, and if you eat at their bar or restaurant - a $10 credit back. So, it’s $15 or $25... however you want to splice it. Whatever - it’s a resort fee! We brought our own beach towels and bags so their cute totes & towels felt less like an amenity and more like a non optional fee. We were on our babymoon and are also very laid back so none of this was a deal breaker AT ALL! The hotel is designed beautifully, truly ALL the staff was great and for a couple nights - it’s really worth it. I just wouldn’t advise a long stay if you’re looking for a grown & sexy vibe. It was a good experience but lacked for us in some key areas. I’d go back but I’d have different expectations for it.

We appreciated the one-on-one approach, where a staff member sat down with you to review all of the hotel's amenitities and the surrounding area. People staying at the hotel receive a $10 a day discount from the restaurant, which is a nice touch (more if you stay for 3 nights or more).Our room was comfortable. It was a decent size with a very cozy bed and pillows. We liked having the option to choose air conditioning, the ceiling fan, or opening the door to our lanai to ventilate and cool the room (it can get a bit noisy outside, making these options all the more important). The bathroom was clean, and the shower had great water pressure. The hotel uses high-quality shampoo, conditioner, and soap, and these little touches elevate the experience. WiFi worked well in the room and in the lobby. The location is excellent, where one can easily stroll along the canal, head towards the beaches, or shop at the many stores in the area. We did have dinner at Mahina & Suns, and a seperate review has been prepared for it.

We have stayed here several times and I always like to say that I am the oldest person on property, inclusive of guests and employees.

Alas my Gen X, Y, Z and Millenial traveler friends, you need not fret. Despite last weekend's influx of two Baby Boomer couples, The Surfjack remains an urban oasis of good vibes, great tunes, aromatic yumminess and a super chill retreat in the midst of buzzing Waikiki. Really nice cocktails and ono grinds, poolside lounges with a music playlist that encourages and induces dreamy alpha state power naps between plunges into the Instagrammable Wish You Were Here pool. Plenty of hotels talk the talk about their unique vibe and their experiential offerings, but few deliver. The Surfjack was well conceived, is well-run, and does what it does exceptionally. It eschews any notion of being cookie-cutter and has done a wonderful job of carving out a unique niche among the many choices one has in this market. Location is wonderful and easier to escape than the big box brands and some other locations. Walkable to everywhere you want to visit in Waikiki. We have stayed at Moana, Royal Hawaiian, Sheraton, Halekulani, Marriott, Lotus, Prince and The Modern to name just a few, and I can honestly say we prefer the cool and breezy super easy feel of the Surfjack. My wife loves the intimacy of the property in the midst of the bustle of the city, my kid digs the fact he doesn't feel like an alien if he walks in barefoot, wearing board shorts and looking surly, and I am partial to their tequila cocktails with just the right tunes for poolside unwinding. All good in the Surfjack 'hood. Keep up the great and fun work Lynette and team.","Lahaina, Hawaii","Scott O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lahaina, Hawaii</strong>",4,5.0

We needed a place to stay while the authorities processed the death and we could have her cremated before flying back to the mainland with her ashes.Under the circumstances, all we really wanted from a hotel was a clean place that would afford us privacy and from where we could make phone calls and such. I also thought it might be a good idea to be somewhat near a beach, in case we wanted to get some fresh air in the evenings, after what were bound to be long and trying days. Also, not knowing how long we might have to stay in Honolulu, we wanted a hotel that would be flexible in case we needed to check out a day or two early.So we found Surfjack Hotel, based on their reviews and rating on Yelp. Initially we booked two rooms, one for my father-in-law and one for my wife and me. We hoped to have the two rooms right next to each other, in case my wife or I needed to help my father-in-law with something. And we booked ourselves in for 4 nights, again not really sure how long the Honolulu authorities might take with my mother-in-law’s remains.At check-in, we mentioned our circumstances to the hotel staff. They were very kind and offered us water and coffee. They also immediately upgraded one of our rooms to a 2-bedroom suite! When we got to the suite, we realized that all three of us could stay in it and we didn’t really need the second room. So we called up the front desk and they were again very happy to accomodate our request to cancel the second room without any hassle.Of course, we realized that we had inadvertently shortchanged the hotel in the process so I went down to the front desk a couple hours later and offered to make up the difference — basically, we were happy to stay in just the suite, but we also wanted to make sure we were paying the hotel a fair price for it. Well, I spoke with three people there, and each of them told me the same thing: not to worry about it and just tell them if we needed anything from them — what incredible generosity!In a very difficult time for our family, Surfjack really went above and beyond in their hospitality. The room was well-equipped, the beds were very comfortable, and though we didn't use it, the pool setting looked very relaxing. The location was a short walk from the beach and the major Waikiki spots. And not only was the staff kind and generous, but they were also very responsive to our requests. If we ever find ourselves in Waikiki again, we know where we’ll be staying.","San Jose, California, United States","Shaunak K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California, United States</strong>",1,5.0

Due to unforseen circumstances our 10 day stay turned into 29 days. The entire Surfjack staff took such great care of us during an extremely stressful time! 1. The hotel itself is super cute! As an interior designer visuals are a major thing for me. The mid-century modern vibe is great and the whole hotel is super instagrammable. I was a witness to several photo shoots while I was there. 2. The front desk staff was extremely helpful as we had to extend our reservation twice while we were there. There was a point in which they were almost booked up when we needed to extend and Crystal worked her magic so we wouldn't have to move to a different hotel.3.The valets are promp and super friendly! Several of them would greet my dog everyday after his walk. 4. When they say they're dog friendly they mean it! The entire staff constantly loved on my dog. The hotel is also located close to a nice park with a canal which is perfect for dog walking. 5. Mahina and Suns is the restaurant in the hotel. It's not only delicious, but again, the staff is amazing! The outdoors portion is dog friendly and sometines they'll even give your pup a little snack. Elan, Jayda, and Alison, amongst the rest of the staff were totally accommodating. I was often downstairs working by the cabanas and they would check on me and also make sure I had food if I wanted it. Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to skip out on the huge resort experience and enjoy a more intimate experience. They truly treated us like family and I'll never forget our time there! Sry...long review, but they deserve it. ",,jacquelynw726,4,5.0

We had the event catered by the local restaurant onsite Mahina & Sun's and it was truly a magnificent event. I loved the laid back vibe of the Suarfjack and the gorgeous pool and surrounds.

We were told we paid online prior to arriving but when we got there we were surprised to find out that we “hadn’t yet paid,” and that the price, which we were told was ~$270 a night, would actually be $400+ for the first night and then $270 a night after that (for what exactly? A view of other buildings or parking garages?!)!! At this point we were too tired to argue, so we grudgingly paid, got our keys, and went upstairs. When we got to our room there was dried (what looked like) vomit on the floor in the bedroom, a dirty shower, and urine on the tile around the toilet!!! All of this, ESPECIALLY for the price, was COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. THEN when you leave they charge you an ADDITIONAL $40+ for parking- for 2 days!!!!!!! We stay in a beautiful place on The Big Island for $217 a night (which is two bedroom, 2 1/2 bathroom, full kitchen and a washer and dryer and free parking), and with staff that genuinely cares about your experience!

Honolulu was an awesome city to explore with great restaurants, cool bars, lots of craft beer, art, and while the beach was also beautiful, we spend maybe a few hours on it given the other spots/resorts we stayed at. We chilled at the pool most mornings, found great brunches/lunches and explored the city in the afternoons.

The food and service at the restaurant downstairs was enjoyed by us and our 2 teenage daughters. I will add a specific restaurant review on Trip Adviser also. We booked 2 double beds and were given a lovely sized corner room with a wrap around balcony. No ocean views, but we went to the beach for that! As the hotel is set back about a block from the main strip of Waikiki, it was certainly more quiet and peaceful than what we have experienced in the past at some of the major hotels. It was an easy walk to everywhere, including the beach (10 minutes walk). The towels and other facilities available for your use were great to have also (included in the facilities tax you pay at the end of your stay by the way - around USD$25 per day- that's the norm in Hawaii). As is the required tipping of at least 15% when dining out, on tours, drivers of cabs and transport etc. and the cleaning of your room in the US. Our room was cleaned beautifully when we requested it (as we were happy to reuse towels etc rather than have the room cleaned daily). We left USD $5.00 for the cleaner each time. Nice to do.The gorgeous staff made us feel so welcome, and nothing was ever a problem for them if we needed any assistance. They were great with local knowledge and advice.NOTE: Budget the tipping into your spending money as it is expected in the USA.I work for an Airline in Australia and have stayed at many hotels, and have been to Hawaii several times over the years, and this experience at the Surfjack was one of the absolute best! Accomodation in Hawaii is expensive, especially due to our AUD, so we also used some frequent flyer points to take a decent amount off our 10 night stay. Be careful when booking to read the reviews, as some older hotels have issue with their showers, hot water, cleaners not cleaning properly, bugs etc. You will find NONE of these issues at the Surfjack. In fact, the shower / water pressure/ bathroom was exceptional and the room cleanliness was fantastic (newer renovated helps too). The rooms have great soundproofing, as we did not hear any noise at all from surrounding rooms.The facilities and pool were great, and the free coffee downstairs at the bar area each morning was excellent (not the weak coffee I was expecting in the US thank goodness!). There was lemon/ lime/ pineapple ice water on tap (and sunscreen dispenser too) downstairs, as well as a HOT WATER dispenser for the occasional Noodle Cup or herbal tea to have in your room if you wanted. The ABC shop and Whalers general store on the corner were so handy too! We could keep a few items in our room fridge for easy snacks so as to save a little money on eating out. The I-Hop family restaurant was convenient for brekky, lunch, dinner or take-out and it was around the corner and inexpensive.We would certainly recommend this lovely little hotel to anyone staying in Hawaii, and thank the staff for making our stay such a fantastic experience. I can see why they receive a 4 1/2 star out of 5 average rating on Trip Adviser!

We chose Surfjacks because it had good reviews but was pretty cost-effective for a two bedroom suite (#635). One bedroom has a king bed, the other has a queen bed and the living room has a comfy couch that also has a fold-out bed.If you've gotten this far, you'll know that Surfjacks is not on the beach, and it is a walk to the beach. It's a very easy walk that takes 5-10 minutes. In the morning, we'd get coffee from Oliver + Oliver downstairs (although, there is free coffee at the restaurant, Mahina & Sun's, I prefer espresso) and bring it upstairs to the room to get ready. Walk down to Cheeseburgers for breakfast (e.g. fruitbowl, eggs on toast and mimosas - simple stuff) then head to the beach - easy.Surfjacks is also a ""retro-fitted"" motel - so all entrances to rooms are from the outside. The rooms are slightly tighter than I was expecting, but really, you don't spend a lot of time in the rooms - so they're great for sleeping, getting ready and unwinding. Each room is lent a canvas beach bag which is handy. Our room had two small private balconies, which was nice, but looked into the apartments across the way. However, we used this area to dry our flower crowns, bathing suits, etc as most of the time, we were either by the pool or out and about.The motel has a great, relaxed vibe. The entry is open air and goes freely into the pool area, cafe, restaurant and lounging areas. The pool is absolutely iconic. It is not heated so can be chilly if it's been in the shade. It's more refreshing than off-putting. On Saturday nights, they play movies above the pool which is great atmosphere for drinks and a chat. During other times, they have heaps of live music that sets the tone. These don't go too late as the bar closes at 9:30pm.The staff are super-friendly and helpful.

The building wraps around a courtyard, and once you enter the premises you are sheltered from the busy city. There's an interesting restaurant and bar on the premises as well as a coffee house and gift store, free fruit-infused water, reef-safe sunscreen, and mellow live music many nights. The pool is lovely and a great place to swim or lounge around in the heat of the day. The room itself was quiet and cool, with a small balcony where you can sit outside or dry your swimsuit. I especially appreciated the staff, who are genuinely friendly and personable as well as helpful. My only complaint would be that sometimes there were too many kids in the pool, splashing and screaming, which made adult lounging less pleasant.

Bikes could use a little maintenance but served our purposes just fine. Staff were knowledgeable and friendly and very accommodating on every level. Great location right in downtown Waikiki, walking distance from beach and shops and food. Everything is expensive in Oahu this time of year so it wasn't cheap, but it was good value. Also liked the consciousness about minimizing waste and protecting the environment and they could do more by adding refillable dispensers in the showers for body wash, shampoo and conditioner.

I equate the quality to a freeway side Hotel 6. Staff were attentive and helpful but things fall down from there. I booked based on pix of the room with all the windows, massive outdoor deck and reviews. The one bedroom penthouse we got did not have the corner windows/sliders as in the pix- one slider with a narrow walkway to patio. Patio did deliver. Room was moldy/musty smelling (bringing back smelly Hotel 6 memories from my college days). Carpet in bedroom was wet so perhaps they had just shampooed, but add the poorly functioning ac and we decided within 15 mins we were moving. Credit to the staff who tried to fix ac right away and once we made our decision, made the cancellation of remaining 4 nights easy (we thought it was fair to stay one night, now I think we shoulda' just left).After picking up rental car called to inquire about parking and could barely hear because of blaring music. At arrival desk staff informed me they blast concert loud music in the pool every fricking day from 12-4. The front desk lady and I had to yell in each others' ears to hear each other during check in - cannot imagine how anyone finds this acceptable, including staff. It sounded like a frat party; surprisingly there were some 40+ folks hanging around so we thought there must be something more and agreed to go upstairs. Beware elevator does not go to penthouse floor, but staff will help, which of course costs a couple bucks for the tip. The pictures make this place look amazing. As we walked down the hallways and looked around a bit, I couldn't help but think this was a poorly executed flip done by some novice flippers. Done correctly with more $, they could have knocked it out of the park.  Note, I usually stay at the Trump (or like properties) so my bar may be too high for the surfjack. The Trump hotel is where I called and for $100 more a night I got a oceanfront view from the 23rd floor..with double the square footage, modern, clean and top notch service. If you have low expectations and can get rooms close to 200 or less a night, you may be satisfied. If you are a frequent traveler and appreciate Hyatt Place or higher standards you should avoid the surfjack.","Fountain Hills, Arizona","shastaball</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fountain Hills, Arizona</strong>",103,2.0

We arrived in Honolulu on our Anniversary late around 1030 due to our flight running behind. Therefore, everyone was gone for the night. I checked into our room and noticed the heat and major rust all over the frig! The tv’s look like monitors, our bed was sinking in the middle, the internet was so bad I had to shut off our WiFi on our phones and The room and blankets smelled terrible really old and stale. It was 74 degrees on the thermostat! I turned it as low as possible, no change! I call for help and I get “we are closed for the evening” please called back. My wife and I are from Alaska, 74degree is like a 100 to us! All night we were miserable no sleep at all and we cannot open the windows or curtains because our bed was facing the walkway to the elevator. I did not want anyone to see up sleeping and plus it was just as hot outside. Got up that Morning before nine to keep from getting my car towed (no parking). After leaving voicemails the night before we left the hotel and made a few calls, no answer so we made another call finally someone called us back and said they were going to send a maintenance guy he showed up two hours later still didn’t fix the problem then came while we were out and plugged in AAC portable unit . We returned and it was off so I turned it on and left again for another hour driving around enjoying the AC. Came back to the condominium and it was 73 degrees this time. I called the person listed again. Keep in mind I am speaking with different people each time. I said this is not what I paid for please refund me or prorate the room so I can find another hotel. The employee said let me check with management. Two hours go by so I send an email to the company asking the same thing. Couple of hours later I get an email reply back saying we are going to refund you for your entire stay, which was 14 days and I would have to wait 10 days. I then call the Surfjack Hotel and spoke with a remarkable young woman called Tasi. She was very helpful and quick! She understood our situation and provided my wife and me with an out. Therefore, we booked one of her beautiful rooms that had a large flat screen tv in the bed room and an even larger tv in the living room. The room was so cold that we felt like we were back home in Alaska. We did not want to leave the room it was so nice. Nevertheless, we did on occasion in order to enjoy the great food downstairs in the restaurant, great drinks at the bar downstairs and a dip in the pool located in the center of the hotel. Not to mention the valet and the front desk, greeted my wife and I every single time we came or left the hotel with a wonderful “aloha spirit”! I was so pleased with their superb customer service that I tipped the valet, bartenders, waiters, and the sweet woman who cleaned our room each morning “every time” I saw them. We love Surfjack hotel and now it is our new spot. As a matter fact, I will bring my three kids, my granddaughter and my wife in August for an important assembly.

The manager had the attitude of a dive bar bouncer rather than a hospitality manager. They also do not allow guests to take food or beverage out of their rooms so that they can force guests to patronize their bar at the hotel pool. Drinks were about $12 each which is fine for Waikiki but they are served in a small paper coffee cup that was no more that 10 oz. The room was not clean: there was rust and soap residue on the shower door, mildew in shower, and dried food particle caked to the sink counter. The hotel vibe is very hip and charming but management seems to be more in the business of running a bar than providing good guest experience. I would never stay at the Surfjack again and I would recommend that others choose a more modern hotel near the beach that is hospitality focused.

And sent a bottle of champagne to the room for us enjoy. Everything was explained to us. The hotel has a resort fee but here you feel like are actually getting something for it. WiFi, beach towels/umbrellas, bike hireand sun protection and a bag. Free tea and coffee from the bar (as it’s not in the room) and a $10 credit for the restaurant for each night stay(that you can accumulate). The hotel is a short walk from the beach and posh shops in the center of town. So it’s very convenient. We walked to the Aloha Moana Mall (30Mins) and used their bikes to cycle to Diamond Head. We had a bungalow (odd description for a high rise room) which had a lounge and bedroom. I choose Surfjack because I didn’t want to stay as a generic hotel. The design of the hotel rooms and the rest of the hotel as so unique giving it great personality. The amenities where top quality and the room was spotless. I loved the signature scent. Such attention to details. The service doesn’t let it down either be it the staff serving breakfast who where fun and informative giving us ideas on what to do. Or the guy who issued us with our bikes to the chap that looked after our luggage. They were all so happy to help and so natural about it too. They are a credit to you. The hotel is part of the community which I do like (see their Facebook page) as we saw some yoga classes taking place, and live music by the pool. Which may put some guests off, as it’s not too big around the pool so can seem to take over. So if you are looking for a carefree stay in Honolulu with unique atmosphere and vibe stay here you won’t be disappointed. Thanks for making our stay such a memorable one. We hope to return one day.

A great restaurant on property----and tons more in walking distance. They had room to store our surfboards so did not have to take them up to our room.

This hotel has charm by the bucket loads and is very modern inside. I had a two bedroom suite and was on the 9th floor with two Lanias. These were great to sit outside and read or just watch the city go by. Central location a few blocks from the beach. Pros: 1: The staff are awesome and were always on hand to help with anything you needed. Tiki was one of the funniest guys I have ever met and even when he wasn't working always chatted to me when I ran into him. Thanks also to Darian, Sai , Krys and Kai for help with different things. 2: I really liked the room and the furniture. Again it's a boutique style hotel so not your standard Marriot but there was charm to all the pieces. The AC was good, the bed was comfortable and the sheets crisp and clean. The outlets have USB ports as well as the lamps so no hassle charging all your gear. 3: I loved the shower in my room, the cobbled floor in the shower great water pressure and really loved the bath products. 4: The coffee is excellent and there are plenty of shared spaces by the pool to sit and work if you need or just read a book. Always had water on hand day and night if needed. Cons: 1: Elevators are a bit small sometimes you can be in there looking for your card and the door opens again. You can walk down the stairs but not up to them. 2: One of my bedrooms had a door to the adjoining room and someone from the other side tried it a few times in the middle of the night and it scared the bejesus out of me. The door didn't open and I'm sure it was a mistake on the other person's side but might be good to put a sign saying this is not your room and don't try the door.

Everything else that was recommend to us was very expensive or daggy and outdated. We settled on the Surfjack for two reasons: the reviews on the beds (I really needed a comfy soft bed and it was pretty good!) and the photos and decor. We were not disappointed - it’s a very photogenic hotel and has the most laidback, coolest vibe. I loved the projected surf movies and the live music of an evening.The staff are really nice and chilled and were happy to answer our questions when we needed. Virginia in housekeeping was very friendly and efficient.In terms of location, it’s pretty good - about 10 mins walk to the heart of Waikiki and around 15 mins to the beach. It got a bit intense walking in the heat for lunch etc but at times I was grateful to be away from the hustle and bustle. The resort fee includes a beach towel, a loan of a beach bag, chairs around the pool (which we got easily and I liked not having to pay for those like at other hotels!) and a few other things like free sunscreen and ice for your room.Room for improvements would be the valet charge ($35 US per night, very expensive when I converted back into my home currency) and tea and coffee facilities in the room.The advertised free daily coffee is a bit misleading - in the photos it shows the coffee machine at the hotel’s gift store/shop, but the free coffee is actually more like instant coffee as opposed to a freshly made latte or cappuccino with frothed milk from a barista. Coming from Melbourne, Australia, I’m a bit of a coffee snob, so maybe my expectations were too high there. The instant blend is drinkable though and some days we did buy lattes from the store to give us our stronger caffeine kick. Overall, this is a great hotel and I’d recommend it and would probably stay here again. It’s authentic and has personality!

We decided to stay at The Surfjack Hotel until we found a house. As soon as we arrived, I felt so happy. The staff is very welcoming and accommodating to my family of four (2 adult & 2 kids). I prefer the relaxing and calm atmosphere of a small, boutique hotel vs. the commotion of a big, crowded hotel. We stayed in the 1-bedroom suite. One room, what you walk into, had a pull out bed, TV, small fridge and closet and the1-bedroom has the bathroom with a wonderful shower, TV, King bed and plenty of space to walk around. The coffee in the morning was my favorite part of the day. I woke early to walk downstairs and get coffee. Sometimes I sat by the calm pool and people-watched or just gathered my thoughts. The hotel is in a convenient location. Many restaurants are within walking distance. My one ""con"". The pool closes at 5:30p to all kids. This was tough for my two kids (9 & 6).

Our shower was really really small, but others had bigger. If you are a bigger person, ask for a bigger shower. With a smaller shower, we got a bigger room. So it is a trade off. We loved that they provided sunscreen and refreshing water at the lobby. Good coffee was served every morning. The bus stop is just outside the hotel and it'll take you anywhere on the island.

We got some great recommendations from desk staff for local restaurants that were a little less touristy (like Maguro's-which we loved!).

We are 4 of us, so I booked a 2 bedroom suite, but they said that it was overbooked, so they gave us 2 separate rooms for a night.Even though the manager explained why they gave us the different rooms and even though they gave us a refund for the first night, the fact that we were not able to stay in the reserved room disappointed us very much. We were able to move to the reserved room the next day, but it was a hassle for us to switch rooms. As for the hotel and the rooms, the hotel has no laundry service and no washer and dryer in the building. I found the young staff to be quite variable -- some were eager to serve the guests properly but others were looking at their iPhones and not serving their guests, especially those manning the valet parking desk. Since the size of the pool is small, it looked crowded. The noise level at times was high well into the late evening. This hotel appears to be popular with young families with small children but probably not appropriate for older guests. I booked this hotel because we needed large rooms, and their reputation on trip advisor is pretty good, but we were happy to move to another hotel in Waikiki after the three days.","New York City, New York","mimicoco7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",38,2.0

I chose this hotel from the outstanding reviews it had on line. We were traveling with a 4 month old baby and the service we had was terrific. The hotel is in a great position only 5 minutes from fantastic shopping and choice of restaurants. Walking with our granddaughter in the pram to beach was about 10 minutes and having a small child was no problem at all getting round Waikiki. We booked a three bedroom suite for our son and his family of 6 and we had a one bedroom studio room. The three bedroom suite was excellent for a large family consisting of separate lounge area where we could hang out together, 3 bedrooms and two bathrooms. The staff were so relaxed and friendly and a special mention to Sai who was so attentive and warm. The hotel was fully booked but never seemed crowded even the pool was never crowded like in most resort pools around Waikiki.I really liked the check in procedure which is not rushed and they made you feel so welcomed. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and I will definitely return to this hotel as I adore Hawaii it and was our 4th visit to this magnificent island. The only comment I could add where they could improve is I travel a lot and do like the convenience of being able to make a tea or coffee in your room when ever you feel like it but the Surfjack does not have a kettle or cups in your room for this. They do provide a service where you can get it from bar in hotel in the morning but it’s not always convenient to do that. I also thought for young families the menu in the hotel for breakfast was very limited for choice but just down the road there are plenty of other options which we enjoyed with our young family. The decor in the rooms and hotel is really refreshing and the beds very comfortable and I loved the cool music they played down by the pool.

First, plan on valet parking and paying the high fee. There is no place to park. There is generally no place at first to leave the car for valet. So you end up driving around the block several times. The staff were generally too busy trying mingle with the young singles to help anyone else. There is one gentlemen who worked there, a bigger guy, who was very friendly and who deserves special attention. I wish I would have caught his name. Generally, though, the staff want little to do with guests except for receiving tips. The restaurant staff was the worst and they generally didn't even acknowledge people. The pool is small but nice. It was closed on one evening for a ""pool party."" Consisted with a band, speakers, and drinks. Ended right at 10 so no problem there. However, the nonguests who came for the party stayed very late, pulled the fire alarm, and generally made noise well into the next morning. The staff did nothing about this. The entire event made it uncomfortable to get to the rooms.The room was clean. Our ""three bedroom"" was really two different rooms. The setup was akward. No microwave, coffee pot, etc, in the room despite advertising that there was. We had a view of nothing. The hotel is surrounded by bigger buildings so don't expect much in that regard. The hotel is centrally located, which is nice. Generally, if you are young and looking to party it is a great place. If you are anyone else, probably want to stay elsewhere. The day after we checked out and traveled to Maui, we realized that the hotel put a charge onto our credit card for over a thousand dollars. The amount made no sense. We paid for the rooms as far back as October. I called three times, spoke to three different people, who did nothing to help. The charge went away after 5 days, but why does this place think it is ok to control over a grand of someone's else's money? No explanation was ever given. I always had to call back to speak the manager who apparently is never there.","Citrus Heights, California","bgpappa25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Citrus Heights, California</strong>",25,3.0

I can see now why the pool rule exists. The pool IS THE LOBBY. This area supports the bar and restaurant at night and it would be a bit distracting if their were a lot of kids in the pool. That being said, the staff and amenities more than made up for the pool restriction. The hotel really works hard to provide everything one would need for a beach vacation. There is a tote bag in each room that you can use during your stay. You can check out towels and camping style beach chairs when heading to the beach. They even have sunscreen dispensers in the lobby. The staff was very helpful. Jordan at the desk was great in helping us plan less touristy excursions.

Comfortable bed and great tv. Staff were all friendly. The food at Mahina and Suns is excellent and staff very helpful. The coffee at Olive and Oliver was the best we had in Honolulu. Now the negatives : Walls are very thin and corridors can be noisy at times. The pool area is great but when all lounge chairs are out there is not a lot of room to walk around the edge (where the concrete with grip is). The concrete is polished in the majority of areas and hence my title ‘accident waiting to happen’ . Upon our arrival our room was not ready so I chose to go for a swim in the pool whilst waiting. Upon getting out of the pool I chose to walk at a path behind the pool and unfortunately as I had wet feet I slipped on a ramp area , landing heavily and hitting my head. Staff and a guest did immediately rush to my aid and I was offered medical assistance. After about 10 minutes I did decide it would be best to seek medical advice as my head had hit the concrete quite heavily. An ambulance was called and I was taken to hospital. I was lucky nothing was broken and I am thankful that it was not worse, it has been a week today and I have a huge black bruise on my bottom that is getting bigger not smaller. I had multiple bruises come out on my arms , legs and toes. My head is still tender to touch. Even today I cannot walk without pain in my foot and I have pulled a muscle in one arm. The guest who was first to get to me commented that she had slipped in the same spot the day before but caught herself before falling. Accidents happen but it is annoying when they can be prevented. I have just read reviews on this site from over a year ago that warn the same thing . I am hugely disappointed that a simple fix has not been done to reduce the likelihood of these accidents happening . Grind the concrete and make a rough finish rather than polished. I am now on the second leg of my trip about to hop on a cruise and I won’t let these injuries stop me but it is frustrating that it is hampering my enjoyment of a trip I have been planning for quite some time. I am also disappointed that in the whole time I was in the hotel that nobody from management ever enquired how I was and in fact until I went to thank staff for their help no one even approached me to ask how I went at the hospital. It was also interesting that a cleaning lady asked my husband how I was a few days after the fall so all staff clearly knew about me.Just to add to my trip, on one of the last nights we were there we got take away from Mahina and Suns. About 2 hours later I got a call from someone in accounts saying they needed my credit card again and he knew the amount I had spent, my name and the time I was at the restaurant. I figured this to be a scam and reported it to the front desk and after they had a chance to investigate that night, I was offered to swap rooms the next day which I declined. After hearing no more, the next day I enquired what the result was and was assured that it was a scam that had been happening in the area and they were changing how they handled calls to the hotel. An unlucky coincidence that I was the one getting scammed.We had a late night flight out, so I enquired about a late checkout and mentioned I was happy to pay. As they were booked out we were offered a hospitality suite for the time we needed (5hrs) . The next day when I called to confirm I was told there was no record of that request even though I saw it written in their book. The girl noted it for me again and then when it came time for checkout we were told it was only available b/n 5 and 6pm. Don’t get me wrong,it was a courtesy I very much appreciated but why all the stories and added to the list of things that had happened to me that week it was another frustration.In closing would I recommend staying here? Yes, but be very careful around the pool area and indeed the concreted area as there is always areas with water from people getting out of the pool (even the lifts).","Melbourne, Australia","AussieBenean</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",30,2.0

We travel all over the world and I can say bar none, this hotel across the board has the nicest, most courteous yet professional employees we have ever experienced. Congratulations to management for hiring and training the BEST people in hospitality. Every interaction we has was a pleasure! When you interact with Surfjack employees you can tell that they truly care- they look you in the eye, they listen and they respond helpfully and with a smile. We will stay here every time we go to Waikiki. My only issue is the basic rooms are very small-so we will definitely pay extra to stay in a larger room on our next visit.

We love this gem of a hotel and can’t wait to come back. I was very skeptical of the hotel before arriving – how could this little boutique hotel several blocks from the beach be either the #1 or #2 hotel on TripAdvisor? Soon after arriving, it all made sense. In a city full of anonymous mega-hotels, the Surfjack manages to create a personal experience with strong attention to detail. It’s an experience unlike any other in Honolulu. What the hotel does right:- Service. They’re genuine, gracious, welcoming, caring, warm…the best comparison is Four Seasons level of service. My wife and I have stayed at nearly all the major Honolulu hotels, and nearly all of them have terrible service. The only hotel with comparable service is the Kahala, but it’s an old-school hotel for old rich people. The doormen went out of their way for us, and almost seemed surprised when we tipped them. The waitresses at Mahina & Sun’s were hard-working and incredibly hospitable. My wife and I are very uncool mid-30s parents with a rambunctious toddler in tow – we aren’t nearly as cool as many of the young pretty people staying here, yet the hotel still treated us like VIPs. - Awesome design. It’s trendy, timeless, cool and comfortable. It feels like staying at a very stylish friend’s beach house. There are several other new “boutique” hotels in Waikiki that are all trying to achieve a similar vibe, but they all feel corporate and lack the authentic ambiance of the Surfjack. The strong design point of view is carried through with a high attention to detail throughout the hotel. This will never be confused for a 5-star luxury hotel, but we still appreciated the high-quality materials in the bathroom, the extremely comfortable and stylish sofa in the 1-bedroom suites, the unique lighting fixtures, and interesting art. Everything feels very purposeful.- Mahina & Sun’s. We really liked the restaurant. This is the sort of food-focused restaurant that you always want in your hotel. In our experience, Waikiki hotels generally have bad food options, so we really appreciated this restaurant. Folks who complained about the price have clearly never eaten in Hawaii – we think it’s very well priced for the quality. We enjoyed everything we ate, and with the exception of one bar-tender on a busy Saturday night, everyone couldn’t have been any friendlier to us. Good to know:- This is not a high-end luxury hotel, nor is it trying to be one. Rather, it’s a genuinely comfortable boutique hotel that focuses on the basics and gets them all right. The elevator is not exactly shiny and polished, and all the corridors are open-air. Half the hotel looks onto some “urban” views of surrounding high-rises….but even with all that, it’s a super comfortable and enjoyable place to stay. - Location. We were initially a little put off with being several blocks from the beach and Kalakaua, but we quickly grew to appreciate the location. The location isn’t nearly as congested as Kalakaua and Kuhio, yet everything you need or want is generally only a 5-10 minute walk away. There’s an ABC store 20 steps away. And if you’re going to the beach, it’s super convenient to walk to Fort Derussy Beach, which is a better beach than Waikiki. Bottom Line: The Surfjack is our new go-to home away from home in Waikiki. We’ve stayed at the Kahala, Hyatt, Moana Surfrider, Hilton Hawaiian Village and many others, but no other hotel in Waikiki provides the total experience like the Surfjack.","San Francisco, California","nelsonjj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",79,5.0

After a long flight, we seem to have been given an upgrade (originally booked a bungalow with two beds and were upgraded to a room with two bedrooms!) The room itself was very nice and spacious. The bathroom was large as well (minus the shower- it was very small). I loved the pool, although didn’t have a chance to go in it. Liked all the small details like the free sunblock, water etc. Had breakfast at Mahina & Sons and it was excellent (highly recommend!). The front desk was very accommodating too. Location wise, right around the corner was an ABC convenience store, there were some bars in the area and about a block away you hit the main strip, starting with Louis Vuitton. The beach was a little bit further but totally walkable.All in all, my time at the Surfjack was short-lived but I enjoyed myself. If I’m being honest, I ended up staying at one of the chain hotels right on Waikiki Beach after my cruise and I enjoyed being beachfront more BUT from a monetary perspective, Surfjack when I booked it was a great deal so if you are staying for an extended period, it might make sense to stay here.",Canada,"ilovedgreece</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",365,4.0

Skyscrapers, restaurants, and tchotchke shops line Waikiki Beach. It reminds me more of New York City or Miami than the remote port towns and resort communities that line the beaches of Maui or The Big Island. The Surfjack Hotel & Swim Club is a welcomed reprieve from the hustling Honolulu.The boutique hotel recently opened (formerly the Hokele Suites) and greets guests with a 1960s retro beach vibe. Think Elvis' Blue Hawaii meets Don Draper. It's hard not to feel effortlessly cool and relaxed upon walking into the main atrium where guests casually sunbathe by the iconic ""Wish You Were Here"" pool or share a meal outside of the Mahina & Sun's. Bloggers and Instagrammers aren't hard to find. Between the iconic pool, local art, and coffee/botique Olive & Oliver, the property is highly #instagrammable. The PenthouseAfter a few days in an Airbnb on The Big Island, I knew my family and I would prefer to have a little wiggle room for our two days in Oahu. Most hotels offer a two double/queen bed suite with a mini fridge and a couch for $400-$550 a night (avg. Waikiki weekend rates). Compare this to our private, 2BD/2BR Kona condo costing $275 a night! We landed on The Surfjack, because of the non-traditional hotel experience it promised. For $400 a night, we stayed in a one bedroom suite penthouse at The Surfjack, and the experience didn't disappoint. We had a private, oversized lanai that wrapped around the corner of the room. The lanai had a table, two chaise lounges, and great views of the city center (A.K.A people's apartments and offices next door). It was so comfortable, in fact, that I fell asleep on the lanai after a filling meal at Roy's Waikiki. The one-bedroom penthouse featured a main living room with ample closet and drawer storage. There was a wet-bar with a safe and mini-fridge. The living room sofa was very comfortable, and converted into a pull out bed. Both the living room and the master bedroom had access to the wrap around lanai. And I can't forget to mention the bathroom. The shower was divine with a pressurized rain shower and a black stone floor. The bath products were locally sourced and smelled...like Hawaii.The AmenitiesThere's a $25.00 a day fee that includes a $10 dinner credit at Mahina & Sun’s, a beach cruiser bicycle rental for up to 4 hours, Morning Surfjack blend coffee at Mahina & Sun’s, daily local newspaper, local snack basket, usage of a Swim Club Tote, Towels, Beach Chairs to use during stay, and WiFi. If you fall in love with you Swim Club tote (like I did) you can purchase yours for $25.00 at the front desk.The ExperienceThe Surfjack has a calendar of events each month that range from yoga, pop-up shops, live music, etc. I personally loved that they featured movies by the pool each night.The Location412 Lewers St. is an easy walk to the beach. Along the way you'll find lots of cute boutiques to slip into for a novelty t-shirt or pair of pineapple sunglasses. While some travelers might overlook The Surfjack because it's not directly on the beach, I found this to be one of the best reasons to stay here. It's effortlessly quiet, chic, and super cool, without the bustle of nearby Waikiki. AB","Dallas, Texas","Ann B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",28,5.0

The Surfjack has a lovely vibe, very relaxing and nice touches such as the cucumber water dispensers and sunblock by the pool. Enjoyed lounging by and swimming in the pool and the little boutique coffee shop was great to get a proper coffee . I've noted that other reviewers have mentioned that the regular rooms are small and our suite experience has probably influenced my gushing review but regardless the Surfjack was a friendly welcoming little haven.

It is located just away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but close enough to easily walk to anything. The best part was sitting at the bar in the evenings. The menu has some different style cocktails which were all amazing and made using local ingredients. We even planned our day around making time for a couple cocktails at this bar. My only negative would be that there was a very loud party happening at the pool (which is right in the lobby) for cinco de mayo when we checked in. It made it very hard to hear the check in staff and I panicked a bit that we had unknowingly picked a party style hotel (I was there with my mom and partner).

My husband and I are not big nightlife people (instead we were up and out early), so we enjoyed getting a cocktail from Mahina and Sun's and sitting by the pool at night to watch old movies (like South Pacific) on the big screen.The overall vibe of the Surfjack fit in with what we look for in a hotel: the rooms are clean, the amenities are useful, and the decor is themed and attractive (as a photographer, I find this important!).

The pool was fine but situated right at the front of the property so you were swimming/lounging a couple of metres front the footpath. Strange. Our room was quiet, but the hotel had functions on every night we were there so we had to push our way through milling crowds in order to get to the lift to our room.

The rooms could use manuals to explain how things work such as the lights, the fan and the alarm clock. Noise insulation is fine. Safes in each room. Coffee and wifi are included as part of the $25/day resort fee (it's a shame that they charge a resort fee on top of the room rate). The bed was very comfortable. Curtains provide sufficient darkening of the room.The bathroom design is in keeping with the funky vibe. And it has hooks! I repeat, women need hooks. Plenty of hot water.The restaurant didn't offer much that I could eat (allergies) but the food looked quite good and it was always busy. Drinks are discounted during happy hour. Live entertainment nightly.Your room key gets you free admission to the Bishop Museum and the Honolulu Museum of Art. Fair warning, the Bishop is a $30 cab ride away.

We stayed in the one bedroom suite, and it was great to have the living room space and small deck for lounging. Speaking of lounging, the several outdoor spaces around the center pool made it feel really cozy when enjoying the island breeze. The Surfjack is only a couple of blocks from the main drag -- so it's quiet and convenient. We had breakfast here every day and everything on the brekkie menu (granola, local fruit and yogurt; breakfast burrito; homemade scones; and best of all, pork adobo fried rice) was delicious. They serve free coffee until 11:30 and for our afternoon jolt, the connected Olive and Oliver makes great Americanos.If you're looking for a low-key modern-vibe in the heart of the Waikiki, stay at the Surfjack.

This was the perfect place. The hotel has around 50 rooms and is a boutique beach-inspired small hotel. From the moment we arrived until we checked out a week later, we enjoyed the hotel very much. The hotel is on Lewers St, so its only a few minutes’ walk to some great restaurants and to Waikiki Beach.On arrival, we instantly felt relaxed with the beach-vibe. We were offered a welcome drink on the outdoor sofa area overlooking the pool, where we were told about the hotel and what is on. We were taken to our room by one of the porters and were happy that we had booked a one-bedroom suite. I can’t comment on the other rooms but the one-bedroom suite has a separate living room and it was ideal for us with two children.The living room has a small fridge, which is restocked with water daily. The sofa converts into a double bed, which we used for our children. The hotel can provide an additional fold-down bed and a baby cot but they charge USD 25 each, which I think is a bit much. There is a large tv in the living room and bedroom with a good selection of channels. Both the living room and bedroom have direct access to a long balcony with a table and 2 chairs.The bedroom was a good size with two double wardrobes for storage. The bed was very comfortable.The shower room is off the living room and we liked the toiletries. Natural products, and again they were restocked daily.Downstairs, we ate at the restaurant a few times and really enjoyed it. Staff were very friendly and accommodating with the children. Breakfast was fantastic. Try the “egg sammie” – the best egg, bacon and avocado sandwich I’ve ever had. It was around USD 15, while coffee is free until 10.30am as part of the USD 25 per day, per room resort fee. Dinner was also very good. Sunday breakfast was the best for us – they had a singer and guitar player playing really good, relaxed music. Perfect beach-style.The pool is just outside the restaurant on the ground floor. While its not big, it does have a few loungers around it and towels are provided by the hotel. The poolt gets sun until around 4 or 5pm. As the hotel isn’t huge, I think it would be easy enough to get a lounger.As part of our room booking, car hire was included, which was good value even with the extras that we had to pay for the hire. We used the valet parking daily at USD 25 (or maybe 35), which seems like a typical fee for hotels.Every member of staff was very friendly and very good with our children too. I would happily stay there again and would recommend it for those looking for a more personal touch than some of the mega-hotels overlooking the beach.",Scotland,"TrueHotelReview</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scotland</strong>",61,5.0

The other one bedroom penthouse suite has a smaller deck but it's a one bedroom and sleeps less. We could fit 5 comfortably in the suite (king bed, queen fold out and another couch). Outside on the roof deck patio you have a round table, 4 chairs, bar cart, 2 loungers, and another 2-3 lounge sofas/chairs and a coffee table. Even had some awesome overhead string lights out there! About 1/3 of the patio is covered if in case it rains which in our case it did. But we didn't mind, it was quite an oasis up there. Room came with fridge, wet bar, and cookies and snacks. Bathroom amenities were the bomb- loved the lavender soap.The clock radio/music system was nice and we connected our iphones to play the music but wished it went higher. To be honest, the outdoor deck is the really the show stopper for this room. It was fun to have drinks and pupus out there; even invited some last minute friends to come check out. It would be well worth it just to rent the room to have a party up top. Great view of their signature pool and the Waikiki noise was minimal since the Surjack is a bit set back. The only cons to the room is that there is no coffee maker (you do get complimentary coffee in the morning down at the bar) but since the penthouse are walkups, it's a bit of a pain to hike down then come back up. It would be nice to just make a few cups as you get up in the morning on the lanai. Also the ice machine is down at the pool area-same thing, might be nice to have one closer to the penthouse (maybe even on that floor!)But it was an awesome stay at the iconic Surfjack!

Waikiki is a hot crowded touristy mess and this affordable boutique hotel is the antidote. BEST OF ALL are the staff and hospitality. Warm welcoming friendly Sai who works front desk/valet is the best. Everyone else, just as awesome and attentive and personable. During this stay, we asked for a late check out and when we explained that our flight wasn't until 7:30 PM, they offered us a wonderful one-bedroom suite as a hospitality room to use until we depart. This is way cool and even cooler is that my other stays here have been just as comfy and delightful. Also very important, the mattresses are firm, the pillows plump, and the bedding crisp and comfy. The hip design is 60's and the look from wallpaper to furniture delivers kitsch without being gauche.They have adults-only pool hours and an exciting list of nightly events ranging from wine tastings to bossa nova to print block workshops. There's plenty of little luxuries that come with one's stay including nice soaps, free bottled water, great lighting and window dressings, etc. This place is super special.",,jo_lt2018,0,5.0

From the moment we stepped foot onto the property, I felt like we were the most important people staying there. Check in was so simple and the staff was friendly. They immediately brought us both a glass of water and cookies. We were already amazed by the customer service that we couldn't wait to see what our room was like. We got a One Bedroom Suite which was an excellent choice. It comes with a living room in addition to a separated bedroom and bathroom. The TV was much larger then most in other hotel rooms in the living room. All of the lights are dimmable, even the ones in the bathroom which is a great feature. One thing we loved was that there are two entrances to the bathroom. One from the living room with a normal door and another from the bedroom with a sliding door that also locks. This way, we could easily use the bathroom without having to walk all the way into the living room. The shower is one to die for! We also really enjoyed the complimentary toiletries they provide. The location is great as you're not in the craziness of the strip, but you're close enough to everything that it makes it amazing. It's almost like you're escaping the busy Waikiki Strip even through you're only a few blocks away.As i've said before, the best thing about this hotel is the customer service. Especially if you're from Hawaii, you'll love the staff. It seemed like everyone was local and you'd find them at your next party. Sometimes I feel disconnected from hotel staff when they're Japanese as many are in Waikiki because of the large Japanese tourist population. The only downfall of the hotel is that their pool is not heated which makes morning and nighttime swimming pretty difficult unless you like swimming in freeing cold water. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a fun, welcoming, and contemporary vacation!",,connorm217,0,5.0

While not waterfront the beach was a 5 minute walk away - with the hotel providing towers and a bag - so no big deal. The breakfast was a treat. Some minor points - the internal connecting door in the second bedroom to the unit next door unit leaked both light and sound - luckily our neighbors turned in early, and the shower tap did not have a locking nut in place.

Amazing! I have never had a hotel do that before. When we did arrive a day later, we instantly knew we had picked the right hotel. Quirky cool and very friendly reception. An outdoor pool beautifully done was right in front of us and the restaurant was to the right. Not a big place, but it felt very roomy. Great location only about a ten minute walk to the beach. Our family of five stayed in a two bedroom suite and again, not big but very cool and functional. I would describe the style as Hawaii meets art deco meets mid century modern. There were some nice Hawaiian snacks, free of charge-a lovely touch. We were tired from the trip so ended up eating at the hotel. It was so good we came back for lunch and breakfast over the next two days. The staff had a real family culture going on and it showed with exceptional laid back personable service.

My recent stay over the 2017 Christmas / New Years holiday was an absolute pleasure - I am so glad I found this hotel. The other reviews are spot-on.The Surfjack is an incredible escape nestled within the bustling city-life of Waikīkī and allows for a unique blend of Hawaiian spirit, chill / relaxing vibes, amazing location, great food, friendly staff, awesome amenities, and clean, updated rooms.Some of the particulars, I'll try not to spoil everything:- The pool is as fun as it looks - it is the center point of the main floor and very easy to access. It was never crowded, nor empty, seemingly always having a perfect blend of young and old, families and couples. All having a great time.- The daily dose of Caffe Luxxe Surfjack Blend every morning was an incredible surprise and made for an easy morning routine combined with a run down the breezy Canal (1 block north) - bonus points as Caffe Luxxe this is one of our local boutique coffee breweries back home in LA.- There is all-natural Zinc Oxide sunscreen provided on the main floor which was a subtle but nice convenience. Trying to travel with large bottles of sunscreen in carry-on baggage is annoying and it's clear they are aware of this. - Ed Kenney's Mahina & Sun's restaurant was a huge hit. As of the time of this writing, the Surfjack bundles a little extra restaurant-bucks into your stay to spend at Mahina & Sun's. The morning pastries, which are made in-house, are particularly delicious; Especially the cardamom mango breakfast bread.- The Surfjack sits on Lewers St., one of the most exciting streets in Waikīkī. It is perfectly located 1 block from all the madness which is just far enough for some peace & quiet but close enough to walk only a few minutes to literally everything downtown Waikīkī has to offer. As a first-timer to O'ahu, this was a special privilege! I can't remember wanting to walk this much on any other trip I've ever been on outside NYC.- While the hotel rooms themselves are not large, they are kept clean, well-stocked (alongside Davines MOMO accoutrements), and full of nicely-appointed Hawaiian decor. The beds are very comfortable and I enjoyed the large sofa in the Suite. The balcony offered large sliding glass sound-proof doors which made it easy to catch the O'ahu breeze.I am excited to book another trip at the Surfjack. The staff made my vacation effortless and their politeness and willingness to help was noticed and greatly appreciated.","Los Angeles, California","gerbs87</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,5.0

We usually stay at another hotel every winter when we come to Oahu to visit family; but for a number of reasons that usual plan didn’t work out for this year so we sought an alternate. Wow - we really scored booking here at The Surfjack!The hotel is smaller, and in a refreshed Art Deco/ Moderne Building off the Waikiki strip a few blocks. This location is actually a big plus, at nights it’s quieter for sleep and avoids much of the Waikiki traffic as you drive in and out. The staff is professional, friendly, helpful, and genuinely warm. Our room is great, good sized, well furnished, very comfortable bed, and decorated with local art; all with a retro beach flair - quite fun and attractive. Easy to recharge electronic devices, even the lamps and clock have USB ports - fantastic planning! The bathroom is large with a walk in shower, wonderful bath products provided, even a good quality hair dryer. Water bottles and local snacks are provided as a welcome. The public areas of the hotel are attractive and welcoming, a great place to relax, read, or catch up on correspondence.Another plus, there are lots of small local restaurants and shops right outside; and the house restaurant, Mahina and Suns, is one of Ed Kenney’s places (others include Town, Kaimuki Superette, and Mud Hen Water). He’s an innovative chef, combining the best of local ingredients into delectable dishes. The hotel provides free bicycle use, towels, live music in the evenings, really good coffee, and lots of other good options; we are enjoying ourselves and are thinking The Surfjack may be our regular Hotel in the future when we visit Honolulu.","San Jose, California","BethS979</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",24,5.0

The check in and lounge area is decorated very nicely and very clean. The entire hotel is decorated exquisitely with such attention to detail. It's truly a work of art.The room was very spacious and laid out very nice. In most chain hotels your room is just one cramped boring room. However, my room had a separate living room and bedroom. It felt as if I was home. The bathroom was also very nice with Davines-brand shampoo and body wash, which was a huge plus. The pool area was beautiful and smelled divine. Later I found that you could purchase their signature scent sticks for a fee. There were reading areas around the pool which created a relaxing environment to rewind from a day of exploring Oahu. I was very impressed with the high level of simple customer service the staff gives at this hotel. They allowed me to check out late and even relax around the lobby and pool area until I was ready to leave to the airport. They greeted me and bid me farewell as if they had known me as a friend and made me not want to leave. I really feel the spirit of aloha at this hotel and that is the most important thing I look for in a place to stay. The Surfjack is now my go-to hotel for my stays to Honolulu.

Without giving too much away, let’s just say that I had a last minute request and the hotel accommodated without any questions asked, even though my request was financially detrimental to the hotel. I travel often and have never received that level of service - they truly care about you having a good time and doing everything they can to make your stay enjoyable.My only two gripes would probably be that valet parking is a tad expensive, and the surrounding streets can get pretty shady late at night (like after 11p), but honestly, the former is just the going rate for Honolulu and the latter isn’t the hotel’s fault. That’s not to say or can’t have fun or stay safe late at night in the area, just keep your eyes and ears open and don’t be an idiot. In fact, as long as you’re smart, you’ll have a great time.The room was nice, super clean and well maintained. 3.5 stars is about right, with 5-Star service.Definitely try the restaurant - the drinks and food are fantastic (I’m vegetarian and the vegetarian options were superb). Also get some coffee at the cafe, the latte was probably the best that I had throughout my Hawaiian getaway!The staff just “gets it” and they’ll work with you to have a great stay whether you’re with your family, with friends, or just running solo (as I was).Thanks for everything, guys!","Denver, Colorado","joshuad802</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",8,5.0

Valet service was terrible. Check-in staff was “so-so”- meaning just going through the motions. Pool was way too cold, there were a couple of other families with children and all of us were not willing to let our kids swim. Pool staff completely ignored us. We waited to order food and he didn’t even acknowledge us or say “hello, I will be right with you!” We really wanted to try the kale salad and poke bowl, but decided to take our money elsewhere since we weren’t getting any kind of service. Valet service was terrible and unprofessional. They were too busy engaging in their own conversations to know what was going on. We were told to call valet 15min prior for our car. So we did exactly that, and not once was our car ready. We waited 10-15min downstairs with our two young children for our car to finally arrive. And to top it off they even forgot that we called for our car and we waited even longer. I was even more annoyed that my husband kept “tipping” them because he’s such a kind and generous man.

Where it goes for the casual vintage Hawaiian look, the hotel has obviously invested heavily in a high spec refurb, with great design features, right down to the drains in the shower. The morning coffee was very communally welcoming and despite eating at most of the iconic Waikiki restaurants I think the best meal we actually had was at the Surfjack itself.The only draw back is it's a 5 to 10 min walk to the beach, but we actually enjoyed the area and compared to Australia, the beach is nothing to write home about anyway (no offence to Honolulu). All in all would definitely choose Surfjack again, which is the real test. It has recently been taken over by a Japanese hotel chain though, so let's hope they don't change anything, as there are already enough Japanese style run hotels in Waikiki (boooring!)

For our first two nights we stayed at The Surfjack Hotel & Swim Club. We had such a fantastic time at this hotel, it was an awesome way to start our vacation! Before we even began our stay, I had contacted the hotel to inquire about a price for a bottle of champagne to surprise my husband on our first night. They promptly sent me a reply stating congratulations and how they were honored that we chose their hotel for the first couple nights of our trip. They gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne and upgraded us to a suite!! . The valet parking was very accommodating the the check-in was informative and quick, which was wonderful as we had just spent an entire day travelling and were exhausted. We ate at the restaurant both mornings for breakfast which was seriously the best decision!! We even ventured out in Wakiki one morning, as we thought it would be nice to try another spot for breakfast-only venturing right back to Mahini and Suns to have another delicious breakfast. Their complimentary coffee is great and YOU MUST TRY THE BANANA BREAD!!!!. Seriously the best banana bread I have ever tasted. The staff at both the restaurant and the front desk/valet were extremely helpful with giving us fun ideas for our night out to dinner and area attractions. I have never met staff that was so eager to help and enthusiastic about the adventures we were about to embark on. Our one server during Breakfast was so sweet, she kept stopping by our table each time she thought of a new activity/ area to explore!! She genuinely wanted us to have an amazing first day!The hotel decor is spot-on and is so inviting and cozy, and of course the pool is fantastic!!! That was the main reason I had chosen the property was for the pool!!My husband and I are usually not the type that like to ""hang and relax"" in our hotel room or by a hotel pool but something about this property led us to be so attracted to just hanging out in the atmosphere they have created, it really is a one of a kind experience! My only regret, is that I did not spend one extra night at this property, we ran out of time to try out the bikes.I just have two questions...where do we go to purchase one of those awesome alarm clocks that were in the room and where do we find the Christmas tree that was in the lobby!?

I am just in a really good mood because of your hotel! I am beyond impressed - blown away to be honest with the hospitality and every detail of this hotel. I have previously worked at the St.Regis Princeville Resort on Kaua’i and felt hotel stays would always disappoint after being in the industry. First I have to say thank you to the GM or reservations department, whoever allowed the rate to be low insanely low for a one night treat I would never normally be able to afford. ($90 on Expedia, $116 -$138 Kama'aina Rate) You’re hotel has surpassed my expectations. From the friendly Valet, the adorable check-in agent (Crystal I believe); How she had me have a seat and made our interaction personal as she explained everything at check-in. The room credit, although a small fee behind the scenes went a long way. I felt like I was getting something free and that always feels great to anyone. The lobby vibe itself seemed boutique-is and trendy at the same time. I felt comfortable and loved the live music. Although traveling alone I didn’t feel alone. I felt like I could hang out at the bar or by the pool and be very comfortable. I added security feature to get up the elevator is a feature was SUCH a positive- especially as a young single woman traveling alone.The details: The snacks in the room, (I mean really, what hotel anymore has COMPLIMENTARY local snacks?) just took it up a notch even more. The cold water in the fridge and the and amenities (love the bar soap and all of the custom toiletries) made me feel like I was at a high end hotel (which I am).I did something I told myself I wouldn’t do and extended my stay another night. I don’t think I have ever spent over $200 a night on just myself knowing I have a place just an hour away on the north and I don’t know if I will ever again anywhere else but I have to say I splurged, I extended my stay until tomorrow and couldn’t be happier. I let housekeeping know (room 744, ps thank you for the amazing upgrade even though its just me, I made sure not to touch the second bedroom so they wouldn’t have to clean it for no reason tomorrow) that I was fine and my room didn’t need service and she loaded me up on water and a refill of lotion and thanked me for telling her. She was beyond kind. I am blown away that this hotel doesn’t just ‘look cute and trendy’ on instagram but it also made me feel the way I feel. As someone who checked in people for years and sometimes swore hotel stays would forever be tainted -I truly never thought a Waikiki experience would exceed all of my expectations. Keep up everything you are doing! I absolutely love this place. And thank you again for having these pop-up deals come up on Expedia and your Kama’aina rates.

This was our first time there. I was planning to book a 2 bedroom for my family, but the rate for the penthouse was not much more for the night. Upon our arrival, a manager came to the desk to check us in and very politely told us there was a mistake and we would not be able to get a penthouse. As compensation for their error, they comped us our stay for the night in a 2 bedroom, plus they provided us with a $100 food voucher. This was beyond necessary, but a fantastic gesture upon their part.

So, I hope, there's a little bit of credibility in this review.The Surfjack is easily the best boutique hotel I've ever visited. The team is amazing: incredibly warm--they knew my entire party by name before we arrived (we were 3 rooms and 5 guests); they were incredible on the phone; and genuinely seemed stoked that we'd be staying with them. Over the course of my 7 days, I found myself drifting to the front desk just to talk for a minute. I feel bad that I haven't called to say hello, or sent a card. They are really that good. All of our rooms were immaculate, and returned to that state every day. And, even more, they look exactly like the photos on their website. Beds are comfortable, bathrooms are spacious, and the rooms just feel lovely. We stayed in suites and loved them. I, for one, loved my time in O'ahu, and largely account that to our time at The Surfjack. I often find myself sighing and thinking ""I want to go back home to the Surfjack"".Waikiki is lovely, and it is the easiest gateway to beautiful O'ahu, but it is also flush with tourists like Florence in August. The Surfjack is positioned beautifully in Waikiki: you can be in the middle of it with a 5 minute walk, yet easily escape to the big city of Honolulu and the reset of the island. It is a place to take a breath and enjoy your vacation.Marina & Sun's is great: essential dining in Waikiki right downstairs. I ate 2/3 of my meals with them. Not a touch of regret: they were consistently the best meals of my trip. One night I walked around for 2 hours looking for a quiet and civilized place for a cocktail. I returned back to the hotel to realize that I'd been walking around looking for Mahina & Sun's--this is no hyperbole. The cocktail program is great, the team at M&S treated us like old friends, and always seemed legitimately happy to see us. And this is really what makes the Surfjack so great: the entire place is open to you. The entire team wants you there: not just some guest, not your money--You. They want you to be there. They want to host you, and greet you. This is embodied in the openness of the hotel's design; the cabanas that don't need reservations; the blurring between inside & outside; the seamless flow between lobby, pool, cocktail area and restaurant; the onsite/offsite programs; the dining & art recommendations that extend beyond the tourist monster that is Waikiki; and the $10.00 per day dining credit. The entire hotel welcomes you to participate in the swell little happening that is the Surfjack. And you should.","San Diego, California","RevSantos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",0,5.0

However, the valet parking is possibly the worst experience of my life as they lost my car key 2 hrs before my flight. As per their records it was as though I had not given them the keys the night before. Additionally they showed zero concern and was doing very little about the situation until I got hotel employees involved. Finally they found the car but without the key so they asked whether we wanted them to break into the car for the things we had left in the car the night before (would break my insurance or if any claims made by rental company). Eventually when I was at the airport and about to board I was informed that they found the keys and would return the car to the rental, the guy on the phone also assured that he would mail the stuff I left in the car - never mailed anything.

We knew there was not a kettle or microwave in the rooms so we asked if we could have the same, he said most certainly and they would be with us in five mins - at no extra cost! Wow that was a surprise as in the US you are normally charge for any ""extra"".The rooms were clean and fit for purpose, everything worked and the rooms were serviced every day.Downstairs there was a swimming pool, bar, coffee shop and restaurant which all worked well.There was a $25 per day amenities charge which was new to us as being English, apparently this is custom and practice in this part of the world. So for the $25 you get Wifi, pool towels and $10 per day towards your restaurant bill.Adjacent to the hotel entrance there are stores that you can get almost anything day or night such as food and drink. turn left as you come out of the hotel you have the 123 store 30 seconds away, take care you can easily walk straight past it and if you turn right you have the ABC again less the a minuet away.The bus service is excellent and not too expensive, you can get 24 hour hop on hop off tickets, for example if you’re going to Pearl Harbour it works well.In conclusion it is a very friendly quiet and well place hotel and I would recommend it to one and all.

The restuarant served delicious food, but we ordered entree and main and whilst eating the entree portion the main arrived so we had to hold the entree plates in our hands to eat it so the main could be sat on the table to go cold, shame really as it was my birthday dinner.

Originally we were only booked into The Surfjack for a few nights and then were moving to another hotel, but we quickly changed this and stayed at The Surfjack the entire time. The aesthetics of the hotel was what first struck us when walking in, it was so funky and modern with some well thought out spots for guests to relax around the pool.

We were really lucky to find ourselves at this place and have been really happy with our stay. The hotel is a cross between very upmarket youth hostel, hipster boutique hotel and funky bar and restaurant. The staff are super friendly and helpful. The reception staff volunteered to send my postcards when they saw me writing them at the pool. They also apologised that the bar had closed when we arrived late at night but immediately suggested how to find a cosy nightcap. I was a little surprised by the ""Resort Charge"" (a mandatory additional charge levied by almost all hotels on the island to cover, pool towels, etc) when we arrived, but over the course of our stay the $25 dollar a night charge turned out to be by far the best value on the island covering lots more stuff than the other hotels do. At the Surfjack it includes:Wi-Fi.Pool towels (as many as wanted).Towels to take to the beech.Use of the super cool hipster push bikes (with locks and helmets).Snacks in your room.Daily bottles of water.Bottomless amounts of the really good Surfjack coffee all morning.Most relevant a $10 REBATE daily on any food and drink purchases (which is a round of drinks or a homemade scones and banana cakes breakfast for two). The rebate on daily food charges encouraged us to try the food at the hotel which we might not have otherwise done. It was some of the best food we tried in wakiki and reasonably priced in comparison to other hotel food. the poached egg and avocado breakfast is delicious and the salads offered at lunch are really good too.The bar staff are great and a bad influence! I can recommend at afternoon sipping cocktails poolside, as long as you aren't busy later on!It was our honeymoon and the staff upgraded us to a small suite which was very clean, well appointed, well decorated in a slightly hipster/surf style with 2 cable TV's and very effective air-con. Like many local hotel rooms it had what is called a ""city view"", in our case we faced the multi storey car park next door. Initially this was a shock but we quickly realised it meant a really quiet, not over looked, room and patio. With the windows open you could take a lazy afternoon nap and not hear a squeek from the road or the weekend DJ playing in the pool area. The Surfjack is partnered with a close by hotel for tour and concierge service, William arranged a hire car upgrade and discount for us, very friendly. This hotel also has a self service laundry. Located on the top end of Lewer street several bars are in striking distance it was a 5 minute walk to the main strip. Turn left at the end of the street for cheaper eats including a really great noodle bar (the permanent line is worth the ten min wait) and some good Mexican food. For a really fun time off the strip (much cheaper eats and drinks) try Tiki bar Cookoo Coconut 333 Royal Hawaiian Ave.It looks a bit 80's and run down from the street but it's really friendly and fun. You don't find a lot of bars offering cocktails in hollowed out pineapples and coconuts served by German guys with a dry wit.  The surfjack represented really good value for money in the area, the rooms are very nice but the value is mostly realised in the mellow vibes of the pool area with its great food, drink and superb friendly service. If your looking for a hotel in waikiki look no father. If you are on a budget trip and are looking to treat yourself for a night or two this is a great choice. If you have gotten this far down the review thanks for sticking with me. I hope you have a great time where ever you visit.","Leicester, United Kingdom","si431</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leicester, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

This is a small boutique hotel with big style and personality. This hotel is very unique to Waikiki. While other larger chain hotels try to mimic the sort of surfer beach cottage vintage feel infused with modern finesse, the Surfjack hits it on the mark. As soon as you walk through the entry way you are transported to what feels like 1950s Hawaii, not that I was in Hawaii in the 1950s...but this hotel has beautiful mid-century elements along with Hawaiian vintage inspired themes. I love it all!All of the staff we encountered during our stay showed us so much aloha, specifically Tiki the bellman and I think his name was Johnathan at the front desk. Our room was a 1 bedroom suite with a king bed and sofa bed. Spacious enough for the two of us, but could have probably fit another 2 people in living room area. The structure was an existing hotel that had been heavily renovated. The renovation was beautifully done. Given the location, we didn't expect much for the view. Our room was facing ""mauka"" (towards the mountains) and was surprising quiet for Waikiki. We didn't encounter any issues with the room during our stay. The restaurant downstairs, Mahina and Suns is one of my favorite, so naturally, there are no complaints here. Staff was always pleasant and we never had to wait for a table. If I did have to point out any downsides to this hotel it is that they didn't have a laundry room available, but they do offer laundry service. There is a pool in the center of the lobby which is really interesting and falls into the ""swim club"" theme, but they do not have a Jacuzzi unfortunately and the pool does close quite early, but I can imagine that's is so the noise doesn't affect guests in the rooms facing the pool. Lastly, the hotel only offers valet parking, which is pretty standard throughout Waikiki. Only the larger hotel properties offer guest self-parking.This is the type of hotel I sought out and the experience had far exceeded my expectations. The Surfjack hotel is my number one choice for hotels in Waikiki.","Kaneohe, Hawaii","sleepysaurus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",1,5.0

Would have loved a bit more choice in food but then again just head outside and you have so much choice!

With mid-century furniture interspersed, along with artwork curated from local artists and designers, the hotel is intentional in its retro Hawaiian décor with historic flair. The most Instagrammed hotel in Hawai’i lives at the Surfjack. Four little words at the bottom of the pool, “Wish You Were Here.” 10 Minute walk from Waikiki Beach. You can use the Surfjacks’ bikes for 3 hours and they provide locks you can utilize. ABC store on the corner, one block from the Surfjack. Incredible gay bar two doors down, Bacchus Waikiki. Within 5 Blocks of the Hyatt Centric and Laylow if you want nightlife later in the evening. Benji at the front desk is incredible and should get a raise. Reason for a 4-Star: Very slow wait time at Mahina & Suns for drinks. I understand it was the weekend and all bars are busy but there is no reason to wait 15 minutes to pay your tab. I would recommend having more than two bartenders on staff for a Saturday Evening.Room: I stayed in the One Bedroom Suite and it can comfortably fit Two Adults and 2 Children. The sofa bed is very comfortable and no child would complain about sleeping on it. Sliding door for the bathroom and large balcony. Make sure you look at the list of artists that contributed to the hotel in their Hotel Book on the table or TV stand. Included in the Resort Fee is complimentary 3-Hour Access to their bikes, admission to the Honolulu Museum of Art, and a daily $10 Food and Beverage Hotel Credit. Also included is use of a beach/tote bag during your stay. AND coffee in the morning, even if it’s not Hawaiian.Food/Dining: Mahina & Suns is their restaurant and bar. High quality food run by Honolulu chef Ed Kenney. Elevated home cooking featuring produce and ingredients from local farms and markets. Shout out to Kuala Ranch for the Oysters. I dined here for Brunch and Dinner, cannot say anything but great things. The Malted Waffle was incredible and a Bloody Mary with okra, how could you go wrong? On the weekend, expect longer waits for drinks. Con: No coffee from Hawaii at the coffee shop? For supporting local artists and Hawai’i, I would’ve hoped you served local coffee as well. Especially since it’s the only state in the U.S. that can grow coffee commercially. The coffee shop is a third party and technically not related to the hotel.Tip: Stay in tuned with the Events that they host at the Surfjack. They’re not always included for being a guest but they’re always fascinating and innovative. Yoga on the Penthouse Lanai occurs semi-regularly.

Cons:- street noise: an issue not unique to this hotel, as this is a very busy and touristic area and this hotel is right in the middle of the action (in a good way). We probably didn’t get a full nights sleep in the 4 nights we stayed - but I strongly doubt that would have been any different at other Waikiki hotels.

The shower looked great and had two shower heads (a fixed one up top and a handheld one) which was great. The pool area was really cool. I felt the hotel would be best suited to 20 - 35 year olds, with the laid back atmosphere. Though I didn't feel uncomfortable being there. If you took small children you could feel like you should keep them quiet as to not disturb the other guests. I was annoyed when a bar staff forgot the pizza I ordered then offered me a glass of wine to make up for the inconvenience only to forget that as well (I did get the pizza eventually but I never got the wine). The staff at reception were fantastic, my son left his cell phone in a cab and the girl on the desk did all she could to try to retrieve it.

Our first impressions were that it was a unique and compact hotel with staff that were genuinely pleased to see you. The pool was visible right away and people were relaxing around it. You can get an idea of the size from photos on this site. The bar and restaurant were just a few steps away too. We registered with the friendly guys on reception and then went to our room. Our cases were there already, waiting for us. The room was of a decent size with two large beds and all the usual hotel room stuff. There was a balcony that overlooked the pool where music was playing. Each evening, they played an old movie on an outdoor screen (no sound) which reflected the surfing era years ago. It all added to the atmosphere and vibe around the place.The hotel is a short walk from the beach and we were very happy with the location. There are ABC food stores nearby.The bathroom was compact and had everything required. The hair drier was robust and worked well. The towels were of a decent quality.There was a small empty fridge for our use which contained two bottles of water which were replenished each day. There were three packs of snacks also. Dried Mango, butter popcorn and some savoury nibbles. These were a welcome complimentary gesture.Virginia, our housekeeper was a delight with her little notes wishing us a good day. She carried out her duties with a smile and great efficiency, making sure everything was perfect.The aircon was efficient.We ate in the restaurant twice and both meals were extremely good. The waitresses were knowledgeable about the dishes and explained anything that was not clear. The complimentary coffee which you could collect from the restaurant on a morning was welcome.The resort tax of $25 included the water in the fridge each day, beach towels to take out, bikes to ride if desired, Wi-Fi (excellent signal) and $10 against the restaurant for food and drink.We enjoyed having drinks at the bar and the staff treated us as friends with their easy chat.Whenever we came back from a day out, it felt like coming home – always a genuine smile and welcome.One day I fell over at the pool (no, not in an alcoholic stupor). I think a bather may have spilt some sun cream. Within seconds there were at least three members of staff there to help me. They got there before my hubby even. They looked after me and Dexter was particularly concerned and kind.What was apparent to us is that these people really care about their guests and the services they offer and this is not something you often get in the larger impersonal hotels.Unfortunately, when we travelled on to our next holiday destination, we discovered that we had left two of our wallets containing a considerable amount of cash on the bed in the hotel room in the hustle and bustle of preparing to leave. It was late evening in Oahu. We phoned the hotel from San Francisco and they confirmed that they had the wallets and they sent them to us immediately via UPS and we received them two days later every dollar accounted for. At no point were we worried that there would be cash missing. There are not many hotels where you would have that service and honesty. Thank you Virginia. You are a star.To summarise, this is a fantastic hotel with lovely people and I have no hesitation to recommend it. If you want a hotel that is big, impersonal, without character and could be anywhere in the world because of its blandness, then this is not the one for you.","Northampton, United Kingdom","HelenNorthants</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northampton, United Kingdom</strong>",47,5.0

My first impression of this hotel was soured when my partner and I were given a room with two double beds instead of one queen. When we went to the desk to query this we were told that we needed to request one bed, however at no point was that indicated throughout the booking process (be aware that you need to request this in the notes). We were offered to pay to upgrade however chose not to as we had chosen this hotel partly based on the price, otherwise we would have stayed closer to the beach, which I will do next time we visit. The next day we were informed that our room had been upgraded which was lovely and much appreciated as two double beds really doesn't have the same feel for a couple. The next thing that effected the stay was the cleaners vacuuming the halls at 8:30am, if you like to sleep in this may also effect you. One of the cleaners actually walked into our room at 9am when we were in the bed. This was unusual to me as I have stayed in many hotels and nothing like this has never happened before. The final thing that made me decide to write a review was the service at the front desk. We asked for some tips on where to go as we had hired a car for the day. The girl at the desk seemed completely uninterested in offering any tips on where good beaches were or where we could snorkel. She acted as though she knew nothing about the island which to me isn't really acceptable if you work at the front desk of a hotel! This completely contrasted the reviews about wonderful staff as this was the worst service experienced in my whole time in Hawaii. The positives are that the hotel design is cute, the artwork and furniture is lovely and the live music was fantastic, however I wouldn't stay here again based on the above. ",,LaniCabani,3,3.0

It is so welcoming. The Surfjack's guest service is exceptional - all the staff were so kind & go above and beyond to make sure our needs were met during our 10 day stay (7/25-8/3) there. They always greeted us with ""Welcome back family!"" when we returned to the hotel after a long day at the beach or shopping. It made us happy and put a smile on our face. They took their time to explain whatever we needed or made sure our stay is pleasant. They made us feel like part of their family. Thank you!Hotel amenities were fabulous as well - they are from Davine's and We enjoyed Momo shampoo and conditioner. I was going to bring my own but I'm glad I listened to my husband - anyone who is planning to stay at the Surfjack, don't pack shampoo, conditioner, lotion and soap - you won't need it! The hotel got you covered!Groovy chill music and island music play all day long while you enjoy delicious food by the pool. Live music during dinner time - simply a great atmosphere and we enjoyed every minute of it. We would like to thank Dexter and Robbie, the guest managers who made our stay possible and pleasurable. And the crew - Jordyn, Philip, Krystle, Ken, Ben, Channy, Sai and Tiki- thank you so much for being so wonderful and helpful. Your smile and kindness made our children happy and we felt welcomed every time we stepped into the hotel. We appreciate each one of you for treating us with respect and love. For this reason, we will come back to this hotel because there's no other place like it. We were so sad to say goodbyes.We highly recommend this hotel because of the hospitality that you can't get anywhere else. Looking forward to next summer!",,Makiko F,2,5.0

We booked a two bedroom room and it was spacious for two adults and two teens (one teen had the second bedroom, the other had the living room with pull out). We appreciated the beach chairs for our beach days, the fresh towels for beach and pool and the great service. We only had to walk to the corner street for some snack and refreshments we wanted and it was a 7-10 minutes walk to the beach, and what a beach, so blue, soft sand, just beautiful.The hotel pool is great, we all enjoyed it!

We arrived at 7.00am and were fortunate enough to be given immediate access to our room which was very lucky and for which we were very grateful after an overnight 10 hour flight from Melbourne. The check in was quick and efficient. Jordyn was a delight to deal with. Our immediate first impressions were exactly what we expected - a warm, inviting, funky hotel with a calm but vibrant vibe. The scent throughout the lobby which is their signature scent was divine. I couldn't get enough of that smell the whole 12 days we were there. The decor, new and stylish in a mid century relaxed styling which I immersed myself into easily. I loved the decor and the furniture and everything about it. The room (we were again very lucky to be upgraded from a bungalow to a 1 bedroom) was beautiful in its decor and styling and a great size. There was loads of storage which was great. A lot more than we have seem in many hotels. The linen was beautiful. Our two girls, 13 and 8 said the sofa bed was the most comfortable they have ever slept in - ever. Our bed was also very comfortable and we slept very well. The view of the pool was gorgeous. The bathroom was stylish and a good size. The bathroom amenities were MOMO - very high quality. The free coffee in the morning was appreciated by all although I chose to have the coffee at the coffee shop on site which was delicious. The restaraunt Mahina and Sons on site was top quality serving amazing quality food. I thoroughly enjoyed the food and the kids loved the waffles in the morning. The pizza was as good as you get in Italy. The spicy tuna poke bowl delicious. The service was fantastic and the decor and open air style was gorgeous. The pool was a great temperature where I could stay in for ages and not get cold. I loved the music which the played during the day and LOVED the on site DJ on weekends. The music was fantastic. We enjoyed the low rise nature of the building and the fact that everything was within quick and easy reach - the elevators, the room, the pool, the restaraunt, the coffee shop and the street. I'm not sure how people say its 5 minutes walk to main street - we found it to be 2 minutes to walk to Kalakau and another minutes or so to the beach. The location is brilliant. We have never stayed at a property which isn't beach front but we found the location of Surfjack to be just as good albeit the tiniest bit longer to get to the water. We stayed for 5 nights at the Sheraton after the Surfjack to give kids access to the multiple pools etc. All of us, including the kids preferred the Surfjack by a mile. The Sheraton was huge, dated, and it took a long long while to get anywhere due to its sheer size. There were huge amount of people at lifts and it took minutes to walk from the lifts to our room, from lifts to street etc. But mostly it was impersonal. We were merely a number. Anoynomous. Noone knew us. Noone really cared about us and that's OK but having come from the Surfjack where we hugged and kissed the staff when we left and felt immediate sadness on departure - it was very noticeable how much the big hotels such as the Sheraton are lacking in this area. I cannot speak highly enough of ALL the staff at the Surfjack, the day staff, the night staff, reception, the porters, the bell boys. All were BEAUTIFUL kind souls. They became and now are our friends for life. They were helpful with directions and advice and always happy to have a chat but not to the point of encroaching on our space. Even the cleaner would leave us notes every day saying hello and wishing us a good day. The beautiful grace and nature of the Surfjack staff was genuine (even though they have to do it every day) and heart warming. We thank each and every one of them from the bottom of our hearts for an amazing stay. We loved it and we adored you all. In hindsight we wish we hadn't gone to the Sheraton for the last portion of our trip (5 nights there cost us more than 11 nights at the Surfjack). But we wont do that again. Whilst I like to try different places if I return to a destination, I would not consider this with Waikiki.; We would 100% return to the Surfjack. My youngest made me walk her to the Surjack after we left to go to the Sheraton, to show Jordyn her hair braids. That is what made this holiday special - the people at the Surjack. It also didn't hurt that the place is gorgeous! Mahalo Surfjack - we miss you so much! Until next time.

Fantastic staff, super warm and friendly. We stayed 3 nights and felt like family upon leaving. The small boutique atmosphere was an awesome change from the huge poolside experiences at other large hotels. We never had any trouble finding a comfy spot around the pool for all 4 of us. When faced with, what I consider a big issue (the one and only reason this is not a 5 star review), Dexter accommodated us perfectly and made our issue become a small deal. Upon check out Dexter and Channy surprised us with one more gesture of kindness and made our goodbye a perfect one. Dining at Mahina & Sun's was enjoyed by all.

Would definitely stay here again and recommend to clients. Excellent value for money given the cost of the beachfront properties on Waikiki. Probably not suited to families with young children as the pool area is small and it's not a resort-style property so there wouldn't be much for them do to.

My husband and I always liked to spend a night in Waikiki and play tourist. Our usual go to hotel was asking $600 per night. So I choose Surf Jack due to its cute pool and the restaurant Mahina & Suns in the hotel.The hotel is tucked away in Lewer's street. As we drove up we gave our car to the valet. Nothing really special to the entrance, but when you walked in it opened up to this secret mid century oasis. The reception guys quickly greeted us. There were ppl a head of us at check in so Robbie lead us to the sitting area. We admired the thought out decor. He came back quickly and checked us in while we comfortably sat in the lobby. He was super nice and I seriously felt like I was VIP! We got the 1 bedroom. The room was super adorable! Mid century feel, great tile work in the bathroom, carefully chosen decor and art work. In the room is a folder that gave you ideas on places to eat and drink, beaches to visit, etc... They even gave credit to all the artist and collaborators that help make Surf Jack so amazing! The pool is just adorable. We were greeted with a warm smile every time we saw hotel staff. We didn't even leave the hotel during our stay. Now for the restaurant... For lunch we had the pork pizza. Add arugula on it. Paired with a beer at pool side. So good! Dinner: make reservations ahead of time. We met up with some friends. My husband and I split the shrimp and grits and the rib eye. Paired with wine. Both dishes were amazing! I love their farm to table concept. I wished they had more wines from west coast rather then European wines. Breakfast: My only restaurant regret was asking for bailey's for my coffee. $10 a shot. I ordered the adobo pork fried rice. Yes! It was magical.Surf Jack was one of my favorite hotel stays.

They were so close to the beach so was a little nervous about the location of the Surf Jack Hotel in relation to the beach and the main 'strip'. I had read fantastic reviews prior to booking so I knew that this hotel had to offer something great. It certainly lived up to the reviews and my expectations. If you want a room in a concrete block then this hotel is not for you. It has such a great vibe about it that you just loved being there. It is away from the beach by about a block and a half - about a 7 to 10 minute walk away depending on how quick you are. But it is in fact in a fantastic location close to everything. I was travelling with family and we loved it. The hotel doesn't look much from the outside but once you get in, it is lovely. From the lounge room area that forms part of the reception and flows out to the pool it is just a cool place. The pool is a good size. If I was being picky, I would say that the pool area is on the small side, but it seemed to cope well with the volume of people. I would also suggest perhaps having a few more umbrellas or shade cloths being made available as it could get very hot under the sun. There is also music playing by the pool a lot of the time. They in fact have a DJ a couple of afternoons a week which made it quite a loud place to be, definitely not a place if you want to have a snooze by the pool. We loved it but it may not be for everyone. The hotel rooms are lovely and plenty of room for what we required. We spent very little time in the actual room but they were very comfortable. The bathroom is small, but adequate. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Nothing seems too much trouble. We booked one tour and it was done efficiently without any hassle.We ate in the restaurant only once for dinner and it was very lovely.My only real gripe is the resort fee which is $25 per day plus text and that annoys me somewhat but it seems to be part of the set up in Hawaii. It is not enough though of a gripe for me not to stay here again! Loved every minute of it and would definitely stay here again!","Melbourne, Australia","nel-10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",16,5.0

We were upgraded to a one bedroom suite and don't know why,but it was a great room, very comfortable with very high end bath products from Italy and ample fresh towels.We immediately went down to the pool for some sun and swim, the pool temp was PERFECT and in the afternoon a DJ showed up making pool time party time. We ate lunch at Mohina and Sun , the on site restaurant, which was utterly delicious and service with a smile!!!! The set up of the hotel is cozy and warm with fabulous decor and very comfortable chairs!!! We also ate dinner at the hotel as we had an early bus tour in the morning and we just wanted to stay at home, thats what it felt like, home sweet home, with everything you need at hand. Our dinner was amazing, drinks are detailed and special, ahi app and fried avocado tacos to die for. The Mong Chong and Ragu were both dish licking good!!! Just a great meal!!! Every time we dealt with staff they could not have been sweeter and more helpful, from renting bikes, calling a taxi for the airport , giving us information, directions or advise.. Channey and Benjamin we miss you ! And the rest of the desk staff whose names I sadly cant recall all deserve a big shout out!!!

The people who work at the Surfjack are the nicest people imaginable. Check-in was easy and pleasant. We got the 2 bedroom suite and stayed for a week in April with our elementary aged kids. On our first morning there, we got up early to go to Pearl Harbor, and when we got downstairs we were greeted by the front desk staff - we were still a little jet lagged and weren't expecting such a personable and warm welcome to the day. The restaurant was delicious - a bit expensive but you have to at least try it for a dinner and a breakfast, and they do make a very tasty, reasonably priced pasta meal for kids for dinner. If you're a serious foodie, there are plenty of menu options for returning multiple times. For a more budget friendly full breakfast or other meals, IHOP and Starbucks and other good restaurants are a short walk. The burrito shop a block away is good. The suite only had a mini-fridge, no microwave or dishes, so plan accordingly. ABC store is next door if you need water float toys, flip flops, sunscreen, etc. Parking was expensive but not more than what you'd pay anywhere else in the area, and there really aren't any better options in street parking or private garages - just park onsite and enjoy the time not spent looking for other parking. The beds were comfortable and the blackout curtains work great. Cool retro environment - I loved seeing surf movies every night from our balcony while the live music at the restaurant played - just lovely. My son and I played some games we borrowed from the front desk one morning at a table by the pool, while we enjoyed tasty scones from the restaurant and I had an awesome cup of coffee. We encountered the 4th floor housekeeper several times and she was delightful. Same with the maintenance staff, a nice fellow who helped get a game piece out of the pool for us that one morning.

It was and we were grateful for the early check in.The Surfjack is - I'm guessing - a 1960s hotel that has had a complete refurbishment. We liked it. It had a good vibe, a nice pool area and the rooms were very pleasant. The double bed was comfortable, the air con worked super well and the TV screen was enormous (not that we felt the need to watch much TV when there is so much else to do). The bathroom was a good size and the shower had plenty of room. The controls took a little bit of working out but once sorted it was straightforward.The restaurant is right near the pool and has a good vibe to it as well.

It's promoted as retro, hip, boutique hotel so I didn't imagine it would be inundated with young families - but it is. It's a very small pool and probably 2/3 of the day it is dominated by running, squealing, splashing, small kids with their parents claiming the lounges in the sun but then setting up camp at pool's edge on opposite side to watch their kids. There is no quiet. They do have adult swim in evening which is nice but without the benefit of sun, the unheated pool is just too cold to enjoy. Plus, the young families hover at poolside, having their kids put their feet in the water, so its awkward. All of this is, of course, just fine if that's the ambience you seek but if you're an empty nester looking for relaxation or a couple looking for romance, forget it. I would suggest the hotel finds some space somewhere for an adults only sundeck with cool down shower, for reading and relaxation. Now, if you don't care about outdoor spaces or quiet by the pool or you'll mostly be out and about, it will be just fine. The service is excellent (warm, accommodating), the restaurant/bar is great, the room is clean and the retro decor is spot on. They even had available a hospitality room that I was able use until my check in time. It's convenient to main shopping, there's an ABC Store next door so you can stock up on snacks and beverages for your mini fridge. We are not mega resort travelers, so we were attracted to this property for its smaller size and competitive room rate by Honolulu standards. We had a good sized room facing the pool with balcony, it is small but useful to sit and have a drink, get some warm night air. And, it was pretty close (15 minute walk) to the convention center.","Montclair, New Jersey","GirlyFeminist</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montclair, New Jersey</strong>",3,4.0

The Royal Hawaiian and the Moana Surfrider have been my long time faves. They are both in historic buildings, both have beautiful grounds with picture perfect sea views and an authentic Hawaiian vibe that keeps me coming back. Now, I have a new favorite to add to the list, The Suarfjack Hotel & Swim Club. Except for the sea views it ticks all of the before mentioned boxes and a few more. It has a cool aloha energy that is youthful and refreshing. It's not right on the beach, tucked away in a little neighborhood near the Ala Wai Canal, and that makes it special. You can be on the beach in 5 mins but don't have to experience the very crowded Kalakaua Avenue. From the moment I stepped onto the property I felt at home, even thought it was my first stay. The Suarfjack is delivering what Waikiki had been missing, a colorful, playful alternative to the predictable chains that dominate the Honolulu hotel market. The staff in all departments are exceptional, make running the hotel look effortless. We especially enjoyed breakfast each morning at Mahina & Sons, recounting the previous night's adventures with the staff and having a laugh. The hotel offers poolside DJs in the afternoon and live entertainment at night, free coffee in the morning and refreshing fruit infused iced waters throughout the day. There are bikes available, but we didn't use. The rooms are thoughtfully laid out, with a comfy bed & pillows, fab bath products, small fridge and expansive balconies with a small table and chairs. There is also a cute gift ship on site to pick up a souvenir.I highly recommend this property. We just got home this week and having major Suarfjack withdrawals. We will be beak in October!

I was not proatively told about this prior to arriving... but worse... I went on to the website just before arriving to read about the hotel activities for the week and saw a notice about pool maintenance. I panicked and spoke to their website chat person who specifically told me the pool was reopened. While this was very upsetting (why else do you stay in Hawaii) to be fair the staff were very apologetic and upgraded our room. - But then I was charged again for my room even though it was prepaid. I'm yet to receive a refund.- And then I was kindly told that we would receive a bottle of wine for my fiance's birthday. A lovely gesture that never arrived even though i ensured we were in our room early each evening. - Shower in room 247 does not get very hot. Once lukewarm it also gets intermittently cold when you are showering. Cold tap on the sink doesn't work either. - They cant store a bag for us while we are in Maui even though we are returning to the hotel. These things combined really impacted on my enjoyment of the stay. The good? The beds are comfy and the staff are friendly. I just found the communication to be warm but a bit misleading. Was even told the pool would reopen on Monday so restructured our plans. It's Tuesday and it is not looking good for our return trip. Perhaps just a series of unfortunate events.

There aren't as many amenities as in some of the bigger hotels, but was perfect for what we needed.The restaurant is not someplace I would describe as a kid friendly place, and had mostly upper end, fusion type cuisine and wasn't friendly for vegetarians or gluten-free (which both us were one or the other & had her child with us) either, so we didn't eat on site. That was probably one of the only downsides as it made it less convenient to have to walk around for food before our event. The rooms were cute and also tastefully decorated in retro themes and vintage pieces. The price was just OK for the value, but I would give it a try again and I expect it will only become more affordable as it ages.

On arrival we were greeted by Dexter the Manager and a number of his team. We were extremely lucky to be upgraded to a Suite due to our 8 night stay being for a special 30th birthday. The Room: super spacious, all essentials included. A pool view balcony would have been only thing that would have improved it for a little extra sunbathing at the end of the day. The bed had the most wonderful mattress topper on, perfect nights sleep. Great sound proofing as we think our floor was busy with families etc and we didn't ever get disturbed. Also if you have a late flight or are sticking around past the 12pm check out they offer a hospitality suite with full bed, shower etc which you just need to book a time.The Facilities: the pool is such a spectical that it does get popular and the beds/seats are limited but gets sun a lot of the day and is a nice break away from hectic Waikiki beach. Complementary water bottles in room and water coolers at the pool. Plenty of comfy sofa areas on the ground floor if you just want to sit and chill. WIFI always great signal and no complicated sign in process. We rented the bikes (free for 3 hours) and rode to Moana Falls, beware though, no breaks or gears so a bit basic! Wouldn't consider the beach front hotel's as this location was perfect for us as a little boutique retreat with walking distance to everything.The Restaurant (Mahina & Sons): Both guests and non-guests can use it so watch out if there is a special holiday/event on as you don't get preference if you want a table for any meal. We experienced Mother's day which has already happened in the UK so we were unaware and had to make breakfast at 7.30am to ensure we got a table as no reservations left. We had breakfast here everyday as you receive a $10 per day food/drink credit which you lose if unused. Free refillable coffee and tea :-) after that I can definitely recommend the Granola, plentiful and the varied fresh fruit was delicious. Next the scones (well they're not exactly British scones but we'll let that go!) tried all 3 and the Bacon and Cheddar is super yummy!The Staff: this is what makes the place so special. Big shout out to Nehu for our fantastic breakfast and advice almost daily. Everyone welcomes you back every time you enter the door.

The minute you stroll into this open air entryway and pool courtyard you feel invited into this community and welcomed into their modus vivendi: beautiful roomy accommodations; delicious quality drink and foods (from the espresso in Olive & Oliver shop to everything served at chef Ed Kenney's Mahina and Suns restaurant); local arts and music (a calendar full of events); and of course the laid back surf culture. Whether you’re here for business or pleasure, you can accomplish it all from right within the Surfjack experience. And it’s so centrally located, when you do venture out, you wouldn’t need a car, as you can easily walk (Uber or grab public transportation) to anything in town – including of course the beach just blocks away. Surfjack employees embody the aloha spirit and make sure it's infused in everyone's experience.

The one downside was the hidden charges. Expect to pay a compulsory USD25 a night for a 'Hospitality fee' which covers a packet of chips in your room on arrival, two small water bottles a day, a newspaper that you can pick up from the lobby daily and pool towels. In addition to this you should also budget for an additional USD20 for taxes they add on to the bill. These are called Transenet Accommodation Tax and General Excise Tax. All in all an additional USD45 a night which doesn't make it cheaper than the all inclusive resorts. This is not a resort, the pool is lovely but small compared to the resorts. Tips for booking rooms. The advertised 'bungalow' room is not a bungalow but a standard hotel room with beds and small balcony. We paid for an upgrade on arrival to the suite which is really lovely and has a small lounge room, separate bed and bath room. The whole place has been immaculately designed. For families, kids are not allowed in the pool after 5:30pm which isn't ideal. The restaurant food was delicious and they have live music most nights. Great for couples.

Three blocks to the beach and an ABC just on the corner. A boutique hotel with so much more. Rooms are decorated with that surf and beach type theme and is very comfortable. Amenities in the room include a few snacks and two small bottles of water - perfect to get you started. The lotion and bath rinse smell great! There is a sturdy cotton tote that you can use while you are there (and you can buy it if you want to take it home) which was very handy so you weren't walking around with an ABC bag to the beach. They have a steamer in the room vs. an iron - worked just fine. The property isn't large but it gives you the best ""I'm home"" feel. The pool isn't large and my only suggestion would be to improve the lounge chairs (the top umbrella could not be adjusted when in the total recline position) and area for sun time - there are maybe 12-15 loungers and if there was a way to expand that area it wouldn't feel as if those in the restaurant aren't sitting right in ""your space"" per se' while you enjoy the sun. They have a great scent piped in throughout the property- they need to bottle it and sell it. They provide a calendar of events, surfing, learning about the aina', lei making, taste tests, yoga and live music several times a week. Those that play are good and add to the ambiance by the pool and bar area. There is a resort fee, but they provide a daily credit that will be deducted upon checkout when you dine/drink at Mahina and Son's - fabulous idea as I don't think many, if any, hotels do that! Every person I ran into at the property was friendly and full of Aloha - front desk, bell staff, Mahina and Son's, housekeeping and facility staff.

I wanted something authentic, hip, intimate, and centrally located, and was excited to come across The Surfjack. The moment I walked into the inviting and tranquil courtyard, I was greeted by Dexter and Robbie, who took the time to ensure my check-in was efficient while exchanging some fun stories about our favorite sports teams. These guys instantly felt like family, and whereas I could imagine feeling like a small fish in a giant sea guests checking into one of the mega resorts down the street, The Surfjack's atmosphere felt like home. This sentiment became literal when I was graciously offered an upgrade to a rooftop suite, and WOW - I was in heaven. The moment I walked into the room, I called my college friends to let them know that there would be no need to have our reunion at a bar...sunset drinks on the spacious outdoor patio would definitely do the trick. The room perfectly balanced modern, sleek, minimalist designs with beautiful colorful art (which I was told features local artists) and really nice details - like high-end bath products and complimentary snacks (the local potato chips were delicious!) Also - can we talk about the ""Wish you were here"" pool, and how it's quite possibly the most genius pool design? Such a fun and quirky element of the property, and a fun photo opp from the birds eye view of my balcony above. I found the food at the restaurant to be fresh, healthy, and precisely what I craved after a run along Waikiki, just a mere couple blocks away.

There are bicycles to borrow if you want to get about town quickly, there's an ABC store on the corner (and a Whaler's across the road if you want something different), and the pool is gorgeous all afternoon long. Because it's a smaller hotel they treat you as individuals and our teen/tween daughters thought they were in hog heaven. Staff knew their names, they could head down to the restaurant or just hang out near the pool without a care in the world.Every day some camera crew/film crew/TV interview/model shoot was using the hotel as a backdrop (but never enough to get in the way) which is a sign of its stylishness.We had a two-bedroom unit and while it was small it was perfectly suited. There is a small refrigerator and good-sized balconies on all the rooms and while there is no tea or coffee making facility in the room you do get free access to the restaurant's supply.If you do want real tea though (which requires hot water) you can get a kettle from reception - it's a well-kept secret though as none of the literature mentions it.Next time we go to Honolulu we'll be staying at Surfjack and not just because it's close to everything but because of the people.

The service through out was excellent, in particular Channy on reception. The cafe and Mahini and Sons at the bottom were also excellent and basically remove any need to risk going to any of the tourist traps around Waikiki. The down side to the hotel is the fact it isn't on the beach. Its physical location is good in terms of access to things but if you want convenience to go out on to the beach it wouldn't be a good option compared to many of the other hotels. However the price reflects this and therefore it is good value in Waikiki, even if it is very expensive. Only negative point was that I left my chromecast in the back of the TV and called up a day later and it wasn't there.

When planning the trip, we had the typical concerns of first time tourists and spent many hours looking through reviews and pictures of most other Waikiki hotels. In the end, we chose the Surfjack due to a combination of location/room quality/price, and we were very satisfied and will make it our go-to hotel for future visits!1. Location: We liked how it wasn't right by the beach and therefore had relatively less foot traffic. Yet, not too far away from all the touristy shopping to make walking out at night more exciting than it should be. The beach is just a short walk away. It is quite close to many malls with delicious food courts and other restaurants. Really, Waikiki is really not that big and everything is walkable.2. Rooms: Comfortable and clean. We had no issues or complaints. We are typically quite picky with our hotel rooms and especially the bathroom, and the Surfjack passes. We were on the 2nd level but did not have any noise issues. Our balcony basically is adjacent to a parking garage and I can probably converse easily with someone parking their car, so we didn't have the curtains open nor did we ever venture to the balcony. But really, we didn't select the Surfjack for view anyway.3. Amenities: The central focus of the hotel is the pool which is well kept. There are also many lounge areas for one to sit, to do work or just read/converse. It was quite comfortable just sitting in the lounge areas, and it was quiet at night and I was able to get some work done on the computer, while enjoying a light breeze. The restaurant on site was decent and there's free coffee in the am. There is also water by the lounge area to fill up your bottles. 4. Service: This is the area that the Surfjack excels at more than any others. From the moment you check in, when they take you to the lounge to sit you down to go over things, you realize that you will be looked after. The hotel is also not that big, so we never had to wait in line to ask for anything. We had late flights out of HNL and we initially inquired about paying for a late checkout. We were told to wait and see. In the end, they were able to give us 2 hospitality rooms on our last day till late evening at no charge. While this is obviously dependent on availability, I really appreciated how they told us not to just fork out the cash when we asked initially. Other hotels likely wouldn't hesitate.

We usually stay at one of the bigger luxury hotels (Royal Hawaiian, Kahala Resort, The Modern), but thought we'd give SurfJack a try. It's now our go-to, and will definitely be back. The small property was charming, and very ""un-corporate"" - little design details and art displays really set it apart. The complimentary Cafe Luxxe coffee layout each morning was stellar - probably the best cup of coffee you'll have on the island. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, going above and beyond for even the littlest detail. Our room (we were able to upgrade to a one bedroom suite upon check-in for a mere $25/night) was spacious, spotless and had all the amenities you'd expect. The bed was probably the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in.

Although it is tiny compared to other resort-style hotels in Honolulu, the rooms are clean and well-stocked, the staff is attentive and well-trained, and the amenities are plentiful.

Our room was large, immaculate, and featured nice conveniences like USB charging stations and a huge balcony with deck chairs, although it looked directly onto the neighboring apartment building. The bathroom was small but had an excellent shower with great water pressure and regularly refilled bath products. Big props to the wonderful housekeeping staff. The Surfjack is located a few blocks from the busier, more touristy beachfront areas. This was great since we wanted to explore the city and not simply plant ourselves in the sand. There were convenience stores, shops, bars and restaurants just steps away. The onsite restaurant and bar, Mahina and Sun's, was also great, with a locally-sourced menu. It was also often busy, so make reservations in advance. The only minor issue I had with the Surfjack was the various unforeseen charges added to our bill.

The poke dish with the spicy tuna is one of the best food I've had in my life. I've been craving for it since we left. The dish was so excellent and so well-balanced. Every forkful had just the right amount of balance of flavor.My wife gave me some of her food to try (she got the vegetarian poke dish), but it threw the balance off my plate. What I'm trying to say is the dish was already well-balanced, that I didn't need to add anything else to my plate and ruin the palate the chef already designed in that dish. I hope that makes sense.I especially loved that all of the ingredients are fresh, organic, and locally sourced right there. Zack, our server, was SO helpful. My wife and I just got off our early flight, feeling sleepy and hungry at the same time. We were up since 4am PST. He served us promptly, and we felt so relaxed for our lunch.He talked with us, and gave us SO many helpful tips on exploring Waikiki, he answered all of my questions with confidence and helpfulness.It was my first time in Hawaii (my wife's fourth or fifth time), and Zack was the best person to welcome me to Hawaii for the first time.We liked the food so much that when the rest of our family flew in the next day, we invited them to join us at Mahina & Sun's. I had the same dish (poke with spicy tuna).We considered other food options in Waikiki, but they seemed either too expensive or didn't feel authentic for what we were looking for. Which was a more of a local flavor and dish, not something like P.F. Chang that we can eat back at home.Okay, enough about the food.The hotel itself was a real pleasure to stay in. We couldn’t afford of any of the high-end hotels near the beach, but you know what, we really liked the Surfjack. The Surfjack felt like a real treasure to find in the middle of Waikiki, where you have all of these high-end resort hotels to chose from. It felt more low-key, the ambiance and decor was fresh and new. It felt more dynamic. We would’ve missed out on that if we went to a more polished and scrubbed high end hotel. The lounging furniture is a real nice touch. You can order drinks and food from there tool. The interior decor of the rooms are pleasant, fresh, and laid-back. In fact, my wife and want to design our living room now like the room we stayed in. We loved it that much.My wife and I would highly recommend this place to anyone we know that will be visiting Waikiki in the future, even if they don't end up staying at the Surfjack.And we'll definitely want to come back to Mahina & Sun's.","Garden Grove, California","Mokuahi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Garden Grove, California</strong>",3,5.0

You walk by the ""wish you were here"" pool to the elevator. 50's beach decor. Dimmer and auto lights on each switch. Even in the closets. All the drawers in the room were soft close. The mini fridge is stocked daily with complimentary bottles of water. I've taken notes of the bathroom finishes for our own renovation. As close to natural light for a vanity as any makeup artist can ask for since my bathroom did not have a window. The river stone floored shower massages weary feet while the perfect temperature and pressure of the stream soothes away a day's work. Davine products!

We did some research and spoke to some people who had travelled to Hawaii and decided on Oahu and Maui. Our trip started in Oahu at the Surfjack Hotel. Our flight arrived late in the evening so we did not get to the hotel until approximately midnight. There were staff on hand that greeted us with a smile and got us settled. The Hotel itself is very cool and our 1 bdrm suite was awesome! Very clean and unique. We overlooked the pool, such a great view. They told us at check in that coffee was free until 11am each day and that it was the best coffee in town. They weren't wrong. It was literally THE best coffee I've had in my life and that says a lot! We spent some time on Waikiki Beach and shopping in the district, all of which is walking distance to the Surf Jack Hotel. The beach is beautiful and the shops are plentiful. A lot of luxury shopping and the food was pricey. We found Waikiki in general to be pretty commercialised. We rented a car one day and drove up to the North Shore which we HIGHLY recommend. Here you will get a true sense of the beauty of Oahu. We stumbled upon a little macadamia nut farm, stopped at a number of surf beaches to watch the surfers and of course hit Giovanni's shrimp truck! This is a MUST do. Best shrimp ever. We also did the Oahu Falls hike which was pretty cool with all the bamboo trees. We flew Island Air over to Maui after 3 days in Oahu. Although we enjoyed our time at Waikiki beach, Maui is hands down more our speed.

The hotel's just 2-3 blocks away from the beach & we're so glad we didn't stay in the heavy tourist area on the beach. The price is very reasonable considering location, amenities, and rooms (which were always clean with a note left by the staff everyday). We rented a car for two days out of our seven day stay to go to the North Shore and south of Honolulu. Everything else we did was within walking distance or an Uber/Lyft ride away. The hotel's very retro chic and becoming popular quickly, even with the locals. There weren't too many kids so it's great for couples. We ate at Mahina and Suns twice, and my husband said the Ahi was the best meal he had on our vacation.

First, a major hand to the staff. Every single staff member we interacted with was incredibly friendly and helpful. Notably our flight was around midnight the day we checked out so we planned to spend the day wondering around the city - we asked staff about keeping our bags, of course no problem, but they also offered us free use of a hospitality suite that evening from 7-10pm before we had to leave for the airport. It was completely unexpected, but so appreciated - a perfect way to clean up and get everything sorted before heading out.The hotel itself was also great. Good location, cool (and comfortable) modern rooms, beautiful common areas, nice pool, good restaurant on site. We took advantage of a few of the hotel perks - free admission to the Honolulu Museum of Art, free bike rentals (which we used to get to the museum and to explore Chinatown). The Surfjack also provides a great list of local shops, restaurants and bars - many were already on our list to check out, but nice touch and helped us confirm plans to explore Chinatown (highly recommended).

The first night we arrived quite late and the check in was no problem. We were starving and very happy to see the welcome snacks in our room...The rooms and the whole hotel has a laid back retro vibe - the rooms have a walking tour map in them which would lead you to other mid 20th century buildings in the area. One evening the big screen above the open air pool was playing Elvis' Blue Hawaii which sums up the atmosphere. The decor is beautifully designed throughout the hotel, with locally derived quirky artworks, always on theme.We stayed in a one bedroom suite, first on the 6th floor, then on the 4th (higher floor was nicer though neither had a view per se). The beds were the most comfortable we slept on in two weeks, the showers had loads of water and the bathroom amenities were top notch.We didn't use the pool but many did - it's quite small but it was never crowded. The hotel isn't really geared for children though they're welcome of course.The location is central to everything, we walked all over Waikiki and up to Ala Moana mall. Buses are plentiful, we never needed a car though we didn't have time to venture past Honolulu.Highly recommend the Diamond Head hike, the Honolulu Art Museum (which you get into for free by showing your Surfjack room key), the Iolani Palace (go on the tour) and the hotel's restaurant (Mahina & Sun's).Our departing flight was very late so the hotel was very accommodating by providing us with access to a hospitality room where we could relax and freshen up for an hour before leaving for the airport.All in all, the service, location and amenities were excellent at the Surfjack - unreservedly recommended.","Calgary, Canada","OotyKate</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",18,5.0

Every morning you can make your way down to the bar at Mahina & Sun's for a free cup of the best coffee we had in all of Hawaii (and we didn't just stay on Oahu). For those of us that need an actual flat white to get going in the morning, there is also a barista on the other side of the pool ready to make your wish come true (although this one is not free).#2 STYLE: this place has a very cool, chic and chilled out vibe. The styling is amazing, modern and artistic with great little quirky statement pieces all over the place (i.e. the infamous painted mural on the bottom of the pool). The communal hang out areas make you feel like you are sipping cocktails in a hip urban jungle, which personally was right up my ally. The wi-fi throughout the hotel was also excellent.#3 ROOMS: we stayed here twice - 3 days at the beginning of our holiday and 3 days at the end of our holiday. The first day our flight arrived at 6am and we were at the Surfjack by 7am (just a few hours short of check in time...) but the lovely Jordyn was more than happy to accommodate us. She organised for us to upgrade our room (for a decent price) so that we could check in straight away and get some much needed sleep. The big king beds are super comfy and plush and the couch also passed the nap test. My favourite part of the rooms though were the bathrooms - that shower is sooooo good. #4 FOOD: the restaurant downstairs (Mahina & Sun's) is definitely worth a visit, not sure if it's a usual thing but both times we were there we were given a credit to spend at the restaurant which was a nice perk. They have different types of live music every night (e.g. jazz, bossanova etc) which was lovely - we enjoyed sitting on our balcony listening to it as well.#5 LOCATION: for those of you worried about not being close to the beach, it is literally at the end of the street. There is shopping, beaches, restaurants, bars & activities right at Surfjack's door. We loved walking out and exploring each day (hot tip: you can also borrow bikes from Surfjack to cruise around on).#6 STAFF: the staff were so welcoming, friendly and super helpful. They are so gracious about our lack of tipping know how as well... (if you google ""how to tip"" it takes you to some seriously conflicting and confusing places). Shout out to Benjamin at the front desk who was also always ready with some witty banter.In a nutshell, we would definitely recommend this place to anyone and we'll be back again for sure!","Canberra, Australia","amcateade</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",18,5.0

They are best known for their iconic pool, so we got there early so we could enjoy it Saturday during the day. They told us our room wasn't ready yet (we were prepared for that), so we just grabbed some seats by the pool and ordered lunch. They told us that as soon as our room was ready they would notify us. At 5:45PM when we still weren't notified, we went over to the front desk to see what was going on. They seemed super flustered, but felt so awful that no one had come to let us know the room was ready hours ago. A shift change I think impacted this, but they gave us a dining credit at Mahina & Sun's to ""make up"" for it. It really wasn't that big of a deal since we wanted to be by the pool anyhow, but I thought it was a really nice gesture. The rooms are spacious and clean, the servers are friendly and helpful and the coffee shop attached (Olive & Oliver) is adorable.

From the specialty coffee, to the decor, the staff, amenities and location. I'm off to big island today and I can't imagine my next hotel living up to Surfjack. Coffee - being Australian - I love my coffee. Sorted. Great coffee at Olive and Oliver. Rooms - small but very clean and stylish. It's classy to go to a hotel with free hanging hangers and a hairdryer not attached to the wall! Comfortable and beautifully serviced. I was impressed with the two free bottles of water per day included in the amenity fee. As well as welcome snacks (including locally made taro root chips which I now love!) Note that these are a welcome pack and not an everyday pack. Decor - I took many photos because I plan to steal their ideas. I love mid century modern. Clearly the designers respected the origins of the building and worked with it and not against it. Last night when I passed a duo playing bossa nova at the restaurant- I felt as though my MCM dreams were coming true - I may or may have not time-travelled back to the 60s - I can't be sure. (Please note time travel is not offered to all guests ;-). Pool/lounge - great to hang out in. Lovely setting with my favourite Elephant Ear taro plants. Knowing that Michelle and Barack Obama had eaten there the week before did give it that added sparkle. I walked the same steps they walked. Whenever I told locals I was staying at the Surfjack - everyone knew it - they do cool things there... the list goes on. I do suspect it's the coolest hotel in Waikiki. Location - close to the canal, the beach and high end shopping. Loved the location. In the thick of it without being in shopping central which I wouldn't have liked. Staff - I've left the staff till last because they were the best. Every person I met was fun, helpful, informative and nice without being ""too nice"" if you know what I mean. Other stuff: we borrowed the bikes a few times - available in three hour slots which was most helpful. I suspect that when word gets round this place will be hard to book.

But the surfjack staff really knocked it out of the park.Our stay was full of pleasant surprises. Upon check in I mentioned that we were celebrating my girlfriends birthday.They sent a special treat up to the room - without even being asked - free of charge.They had upgraded us from a regular bedroom to a 1bd suite - without being asked - free of charge (2 TVs! one tv in the living area to watch while we painted our nails before dinner...and one in the bedroom to watch while we ate candy and fell asleep - awesome.)Our dinner at their restaurant was accompanied by live soul/jazz singer Maryanne Ito.Next morning, we received fresh cups of Kona coffee delivered to our room while still in our pajamas. Also free, included with our stay.We went down to their restaurant for breakfast and grabbed a complimentary Sunday paper and did crosswords by the pool while sipping a Bloody Mary. A perfect morning.They gladly accommodated my request for a late check-out, and then even stored our luggage for us so we could go for a bike ride on their beach cruisers, and follow the ""mid-century architectural tour of Waikiki"" route map found in each room.I'm not even going to start on the gorgeous room or the delicious food we ate during our stay. Suffice to say every detail of this place is very considered - and will delight you. (Davines® organic shampoo and lotion in the bathrooms? made with carrot, arugula, and milk thistle? of course)To be honest even though WE LIVE IN HONOLULU we have found an excuse to come back - they have a Pau Hana happy hour, pizza and two beers for $20 (and their pizza is surprisingly good) - where we hope to catch one of their screenings of old movies above the pool.I love you surfjack!

There is a communal sitting and work area in the back and a library type setting near the front. There is an espresso bar and a clothing shop as well.

The bellman should always show the guest how lights (not easy to figure out BTW) a/c tv etc work. It is valet parking only and the valet should always close your door. Never happened.

The rooms are uniquely decorated with large bathrooms and the whole place smells like orchids. Our only complaint is that the walls are poorly insulated as this is a renovated old building and accordingly, the sound is easily heard from adjacent rooms. There were two babies in the room next to us and we were welcomed to the sounds of screams throughout the night and morning (and I sleep with earplugs). While I cannot blame the children this was somewhat of a surprise as we travel once per month and have never had this occur before. However, the staff moved us rooms and we were thereafter so happy that we extended our stay by 2 extra nights. Most of the time there were few to no kids in the hotel and the place was more directed to adults only. In this regard, the hotel would do well to simply convert into adults only as even one screamer ruins a lovely chill pool day.

What stood out most, is that from the moment we arrived, every member of the team showed and shared this enormously positive vibe and hospitality just seems to come naturally. Sai, Robbie, Kenny, Khrystal and Benjamin at the front desk are always up for a chat, with smiles all around and always ready to help or give some local advice. Our check-in coincided with a private dinner that the Obamas (OMG!) hosted there. Lots of security measures obviously, yet the place kept on running quite efficiently. Especially during hectic times like that, you could see that the team rallies together and around the GM Lynette, who stayed surprisingly levelheaded and upbeat during the whole process. We found the rooms tastefully decorated in a fresh and understated style. The bathrooms and showers are clean, spacious and have a great selection of soaps and shampoo. We also had the good fortune to stay at one of the suites on the 10th floor that have a private deck with wonderful views of both the ocean and the mountains. Dinner at Mahini and Sun's is excellent (of course, since even the president took his wife and friends to dinner there) and has a menu packed with locally sourced and organic ingredients. We loved the mahi mahi, the pizza, and the guys at the bar made this wonderful Agricola rum, ginger and lime cocktail that's off the menu. For breakfast the waffle with malted caramel, and the pork adobo stand out as clear winners. We decided to celebrate New Years there too, and they hosted a very lively party!A fresh pot of complementary coffee stands on the bar in the morning making it easy to sit down around the pool, or cabana area and slowly wake up to another beautiful Honolulu morning. Restaurants and shops are conveniently close by, and the beach is within easy reach with a short stroll ...or borrow the hotel bikes; a lot of fun too.

I really don't know what else to say but if ever you are thinking of going to Waikiki, I highly recommend the The Surfjack. Kids had a ball in the pool during the their allocated swimming times. The idea of allocating a specific swimming time frame for the kids is an excellent idea because it gives the adults the opportunity to swim at a time where their is less noise if that is their preference.

It was great to have a suite with a separate sitting area with a couch, coffee table, television, chest of drawers,closets, frig, and safe. It was especially helpful to have two free bottles of drinking water in our refrigerator everyday, as well as snacks upon arrival. My husband also appreciated the free cup of morning coffee and the daily newspaper. The beds were comfy, and I am picky about my pillows, but they were just soft enough for me. At first, I had a little difficulty figuring out how to make the water hotter for my showers, but after two times, I soon figured out how to adjust the temp...a little tricky. The light switches were kind of unusual too, but we soon learned which switches turned on particular lamps.

A light bulb was burned out when we arrived, but the maintenance personnel was very friendly and acted quickly to replace it. All of the housekeeping staff were excellent and made sure we had lots of clean towels throughout our stay. We had read to reserve a room on a higher level, and that was good advice, because it might have been too noisy to have a room directly over the pool area. Our room was on the ninth floor and was quiet, and we were able to sleep well at night. We were pleasantly surprised at the quickness and availability of the elevators; we never really had to wait for one, which was nice. The lobby was very inviting, and there was always some type of entertainment at night. We ate breakfast three times at the small restaurant in the lobby, and each time, we felt the menu was rather limited, and the service was extremely slow. We liked the casual, old Hawaii vibe and decorations of the hotel, and especially the fragrant, floral scent that always wafted through the lobby. The front staff was friendly and helpful, and were always quick to give us our complimentary towels as we headed out to the beach each day. My favorite spot on Waikiki Beach has always been directly across from McDonalds (In past years, I went there as a UH student.), so the walk from the Surfjack was a little longer. That was not really a problem, since it gave us a chance to work off extra calories. Make sure to try the Siam Square Thai restaurant next door to the hotel above the ABC store; the food was excellent with generous portions. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Surfjack and would recommend it to other travellers.","Valdez, Alaska","Kubina</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Valdez, Alaska</strong>",44,5.0

The location is wonderful - allowing easy access to Waikiki and main roads to get out of town. The restaurant, Mahina and Sons was very delicious - and the staff was friendly and efficient. Every day started with a stop at the coffee counter inside of Olive and Oliver (the cutest hotel boutique EVER) for a delicious (and well priced) cold brew. And I love how open aired the entire property was always allowing for the island breeze to flow through hallways and public spaces. The front staff was extremely friendly and helpful - especially Crystle who checked us in. She invited us to sit in the lobby and she came to us to finish the check in process. Sai - who greets you upon entry and can assist was luggage, cabs, valet, etc - was so charming and friendly - everyday he just was a pure reflection of the aloha spirit.

Total chill, away from the busy shopping crowds but perfectly walkable to beach, restaurants, & luxury stores. Saying that, we ate at their hotel restaurant Mahina & Suns for Thanksgiving & a few times more for breakfast/lunch/dinner. Really good homemade style meals (ex. Pork adobo fried rice bowl, poke bowls). Live music at night! Service is impeccable for both hotel (front desk, bell service, housekeeping, engineering staff) & restaurant (excellent wait/bartenders)! Even the staff at Olive & Oliver - baristas & sales clerks were super helpful/friendly. As for the room, great clean beautiful design as they use furnishings/art work from local artisans. We got a free upgrade to a 1 bedroom suite, thanks to Robbie during our checkin. Amenities included water bottles in room, free use of bikes---I do wish they had a spot for a gym but it's Hawaii so best spent outdoors.

The waitress was apologetic.

This by far is our favorite place.My wife and I showed up without a reservation after a long flight from New Jersey on Sat Sept. 24th. We were greeted by Robbie at the front desk and asked about rates and availability. He was extremely friendly and welcoming. He allowed us to see the room which gave us a chance to absorb the Aloha Vibe the Surfjack was giving off. We quickly booked a 9 night stay and could not have been happier with our decision. The entire staff was genuinely and sincerely friendly, no phony pre-programmed greetings. I can't say enough good things about the staff. They are just wonderful people with Aloha spirit. My compliments to whomever is doing the hiring.It's rare that a hotel restaurant has really good food, most of the time it's just convenient. Not Mahina & Sun's, it is both excellent and convenient. This is now our favorite restaurant on the island, every meal was delicious. We had breakfast everyday there and I tried everything on the menu, not to mention how good the complimentary coffee was. We had dinner there 3 times and even turned some locals to it and have been there many times since.To top it all off, there's a band there that plays every Sunday named ""Men in Grey Suits"" that complete the Aloha vibe with their Surf-Rock sounds. These guys were so talented. I bought a CD from Robbin with all originals tracks and I've listened to it every single day since.To summarize;Surfjack=Best Hotel....I want to live thereMahina & Sun's=Best Restuarant...possibly anywhereMen In Grey Suits=Best band in Oahu.....and beyond",New Jersey,"Ring23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Jersey</strong>",50,5.0

The Surfjack, however, comes very close! There were many things about it we liked. It has a very inviting open-air lobby/pool area with a cool mid-century modern/nautical aesthetic that is pretty well maintained throughout the entire hotel. The bar/restaurant area is nice and the food is actually pretty good and not crazy expensive. The pool is on the smaller side, but totally appropriate for the space. The room was clean, stylish, and comfortable. We ended up upgrading to a small suite (more on that later) and we were happy with it. The staff was also incredibly friendly, honest, and helpful.The only caution I would say is watch out if you book through a third party vendor/website if you are particular about the room type you want. We booked through a popular website where we specifically indicated a room with a King bed at the time of the reservation. On the day we checked in (we were flying from another island), we called to relay that we were arriving late that night and that we had a king room and all seemed in order. However, when we checked in around 10 PM, we were told that they were putting us in a room with 2 double beds. Apparently the website we booked through did not specify room type to Surfjack when they transmitted the reservation to them (they never do apparently) even though we specifically reserved a King. And of course they were out of king rooms by that evening. The front desk staff offered us a larger room at a reduced upgrade rate, but it was still money we didn't necessarily want to spend and really shouldn't have had to. Honestly, I can't really confirm if it was the website or hotel that pulled the switchero, but I'm assuming this isn't an issue if you book directly with the hotel. It would be worth confirming though in my opinion.All in all, I would definitely recommend the Surfjack!","Saint Louis, Missouri","wlfmn77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",47,5.0

Morning coffee is free at the cafe for all guests and we had a $10 credit so had an early breakfast before going to the airport. The waffle was huge, so was my spinach panino which tasted great.

Based on the reviews, we decided to chose Surfjack. I booked the one bedroom suite since we had our two toddlers with us and when we arrived we were so surprised to get a room that looked identical to the pictures on the website. It was so spacious and clean, decorated very chill, nice white clean bedding, and those most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. The shower was awesome as well, even had a hand held attachment which was great for the kids. The hotel itself was extremely clean, the pool is in the center of the hotel surrounded by the bar, lounge area, etc which was a little awkward with young kids in the evening time surrounded by adults just trying to relax lol but during the day it was very nice and relaxing. Ihop, a general store, and mcdonalds were less than 2 minutes from the lobby which was great. The beach wasn't far according to maps but we didn't end up going. The valet service was also very very convenient, I was a little irritated that it was an added cost, but parking is normally a huge headache and often not very safe so it was more than worth it. Bottom line, if you're looking for a place that is clean, comfortable, and relaxing and not looking to spending 300-400 per night....this is definitely the place to book.","Wahiawa, Hawaii","kgjlittlemonkey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wahiawa, Hawaii</strong>",0,5.0

Its a smallish, nicely decorated hotel with a good pool & a restaurant (which we never had time to use, but it looked enticing). We got off to a bad start as we weren't forewarned about the 'resort fee' of $25/day, which amounted to $25 for two small bottles of water & use of wifi for us, so quite pricey. (We could have offset $10/day of that with restaurant purchases but as we were eating elsewhere with friends that was no use to us.) We were given a disability room on the 2nd floor, no idea why as I thought they would keep that for disabled guests, & being so low down there was no air circulation on the balcony, which felt like a sauna. The room itself was more modern than the other place we stayed in Hawaii, which was nice, bed was comfy, good safe, not a huge amount of space, but perfectly fine. The shower leaked all over the bathroom floor because it had wheelchair access, but they supply about 350 towels, so there was plenty to clean up with.

The pull-up to the valet area can get a little crowded and confusing at peak times, but the super friendly and accommodating vale staff made up for this ""manini"" con.Heard about Surfjack by word-of-mouth and when my girlfriends and I came up with the idea of a last-minute girls' stay-cation, we decided to try Surfjack mainly because we wanted a quieter hotel away from the main part of Waikiki yet still within walking distance. Everything about the hotel and our stay was amazing. Check-In: Benjamin at the Front Desk made us feel immediately welcome and at ease and sent complimentary champagne to our room (probably because he could tell we were stressed-out moms/wives in need of a vacation =) ). Benjamin made our check-in easy and stress-free. Room: We booked a 2-bedroom suite for 3 of us (we were initially going to have 5 of us but 2 of our friends had to cancel). The room was SO cute--spacious but not overwhelming. The decor was very clever and unique. We had a fun time just hanging out and relaxing in the living room without feeling cramped. There was no ""hotel feel"" about the room and it was perfect. Having multiple private balconies was also a nice touch. Food: Mahina & Sun's is AMAZING. EVERYTHING TASTES AMAZING! Service and the Little Touches: The housekeeping staff wrote a thank you note to us for the tip we left in the room for their housecleaning services. That's NEVER happened to us before. A thank you note from them was not expected or necessary. I mean, they're the ones doing the hard work and they're thanking us! But every single member of the hotel staff that we encountered was engaging, friendly and helpful.

The hotel is very cool without being fussy.As nice as the spaces are, the staff here is actually the best part. Sai carried our bags to our room, but he did much more than the literally heavy lifting. He offered some great suggestions of things to do and just generally took care of us from start to finish. A really kind guy who is more than happy to share local knowledge — that's tough to beat.It's obviously not for the budget traveler, and like many hotels in urban spaces has a daily valet parking fee.

He was very respectful, understanding, informative not only to his guests but his co-workers as well. Even the valet service we received was great.

They provide seat pads for those who would just like to dip their feet in! Third, The food from the restaurant was delicious! The avocado tacos, Kailua pig pizza, and burger were to die for! We would make reservations for that restaurant even if we weren't staying at the hotel! Last but not least, the location. The location is priceless! It is right in the middle of Waikiki! Every day we walked in a different direction to adventure and see new things. We actually began playing Pokemon Go and if you really want some awesome Pokemon, Surfjack is the place to stay!

Think 70's Motel, which has been given a makeover !! Positives - Friendly service, Clean rooms and Great location - only a short walk away from Waikiki beach and away from the crowds.Negatives - location of pool. The pool is small and situated at the entrance of the hotel. It is open to views of the street, arriving guests and trades, and with restaurant seating placed around the pool it isn't an ideal environment to relax. Small rooms - Whilst the rooms were clean and nicely decorated, if you have more than one suitcase space becomes an issue. My husband and I were travelling with two large suitcases and a couple of bags and we struggled to move around the room due to a lack of storage and floor space. Overall, this hotel is reasonably priced for Honolulu and is fine for a short stay due to a lack of space and places to relax. However, even though it has had a recent upgrade, my husband and I agree that it has been achieved cheaply (on a shoe string)... and I doubt that this hotel will look good in 6months - 1 years time.","Sydney, Australia","NA_and_Gl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

The hotel is within walking distance of many restaurants, the beach, stores, and bus stops. Unlike many hotels, the Surfjack does have two and three bedroom suites.The food at the hotel’s restaurant was imaginative and flavorful. The free morning coffee was much better than what I have experienced at most other hotels.What I didn't expect during our stay at the Surfjack was the sincerity of Aloha from the staff. That level of Aloha was magnified by those staff members who knew the circumstances of our trip Hawai'i.

When we arrived, the place was a dump, no ac and miserable!!! We immediately went on a search engine to find another place to stay immediately. That's when we found The Surf Jack. Very modern and updated. Right away it was a plus because we needed a place with a private bedroom. We had my husband and I, our 1 yr old and our 2 pre-teen kids. It was amazing, because not only did they have a suite available, but the sofa bed pulled out into a queen bed, not just that, there also was a twin-sized side of the couch as well. Each of my older kids had so much space to sleep! The bedroom had a king sized bed. Our toddler slept with us, but they did have cribs available! Super comfy beds. Great sleeping arrangements for our family. They had so much closet/storage space. I loved how the closets had automatic lights when you open and shut them, super handy. The shower was perfect with the two shower heads! (The handheld was great for my toddler.) it took a while for the hot water to become hot. Free coffee every morning. They had a mini fridge which was awesome. There was no microwave in the room, so we had to eat cold left-overs, however, when we checked out we mentioned the microwave to the front desk and she was so apologetic saying we could've requested one!!! Oh well, such a super tiny set back, it didn't affect us at all! Now we know for next time. The cleaning staff was great: came at a timely manner, did a great job cleaning. They were doing a little maintenance on and off with loud noises, nothing too bothersome. The hotel is only 3 months old so it was expected! The pool area was nice, very cold pool, it was nice during the sunny/hot days for a quick refresher, I don't think it was to temperature enough to relax in- the kids liked it tho! At dusk they start to play old movies on a projector over the pool, which was nice! Such as: blue Hawaii and Endless Summer to name a couple. I wish they had sound for it tho. They played nightly music at a louder volume, but quickly subsided around 10pm. The restaurant menu: kind of too limited in my opinion . Only two choices for the kids menu, on top of limited selections for breakfast,lunch, pupus, and dinner. (Think 1-3 items per section) Good quality, but I'd like to see it with a little more variety. We had to pay $35 a day for the valet. There's no hotel self parking. I guess their parking situation is limited. Eh. For $35 a day I'd expect a lot faster car service, but the Waikiki area is very limited on parking already so they have to make up for it somewhere. I kind of understand but I wish parking was included. I wish at the end of the stay there was a place to add gratuity for the valet folk, we didn't carry enough cash on us everyday to tip, especially since if we took the car out a few times a day. The staff is AMAZING. They really gave us such a pleasant experience. They really are the ones who made our stay! I've never been treated so well at a hotel. Sai, Jordyn, and Benjamin were always happy to see us!!! They always made us feel welcome and gave is great tips for our stay. There was a few things I changed but with the overal experience, I won't be staying anywhere else when I visit Waikiki! Loved it.

Another reviewer likened it to retro cool in a Frank-and-Dean Palm Springs in its heyday kind of cool. I couldn't agree more. Surfjack is dwarfed by the surrounding high rise structures that are modern Waikiki. Given that, I am so glad they kept true to the building's original “bones”. This is a relatively low rise hotel (ten stories, I believe). The interior design is in keeping with the retro theme but updated and fresh - much of which was done in collaboration with various artists. The U-shaped hotel was built around a small swimming pool with a “Wish You Were Here” mosaic graphic on the bottom. Some evenings during my stay they projected surf movies onto a blank wall space. Another night there was an amazing, impromptu music performance. Weekends the place was pumping with youth and vitality...clearly “THE” place to be. From check-in to check-out every single member of the staff was amazing. My room on the 8th floor was an unexpectedly large space with a sitting room separate from the bedroom. In my opinion, more akin to a mini suite than a standard hotel room. Lots of attention to detail (the 'throw-away' cups were compost-able) and more art work (I really liked the pendent lights made from plastic liter bottles). As for the artwork, I was amazed to see none of it screwed to the walls. Super comfy bed and temperature control made for some of the best sleep I've had in a hotel setting. My room was super quiet...amazing given the usual level of noise in Waikiki. Although there was no accommodation for coffee in the room, they served their own blend down in the lobby/restaurant area each morning. The room rates were super reasonable. Parking is a horror show, but that's the nature of Waikiki. No matter where you stay, if you're driving a car, you'll need to factor parking into the cost. Surfjack is working on getting their parking garage squared away. I'm not sure how that will affect the price but during my stay parking ran $35/day. As for the restaurant, Mahina & Sun's....wow. I'm surprised the restaurant doesn't have it's own listing on Tripadvisor. Chef Ed Kenney has something special here. The only bad meal I had during my entire stay on Oahu was the one I didn't have at Mahina & Sun's. I commented on and asked about the very unusual wine selection; it is not your usual Chardonnay/Cabernet type list. My understanding was the chef, together with the staff, came up with the selections. Every wine I tried was different and paired well with the food (thank you Alicia!). I wish I could say more about the different menu items but I landed on a favorite and found it hard to switch. My first night I had the butter lettuce salad (it was late and I wanted something light) and the banana pudding for dessert. After that, I landed on the Ahi Palaha. Perfectly seared ahi topped with a limu 'salsa' verde on a 12 grain rice salad. Amazing dish. Very reasonable price.I could go on and on (and have, sort of). It's not easy being away from home for work, but this place and their staff made me feel I as though I was staying with family. I am smitten.","Captain Cook, Hawaii, United States","Nancy Z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Captain Cook, Hawaii, United States</strong>",51,5.0

It was so good that we went back after we made a trip to the Big Island. The staff are just so nice and helpful. Got a really relaxed vibe from the place. The lobby is a pool area with a bar, very different to the usual hotel lobby. It's newly renovated and is retro surf themed. Studio apartment was prefect, had everything we needed and was great to have a separate bedroom. We ate in the restaurant one night. It was average for the price. Location isn't beach side but it's only a 7 min walk to Waikiki beach. Would stay here again for sure.

They remembered my name every time they saw me. The lobby and pool area have a fresh retro feel with some eye catching art dotted about the place. The pool is a vibrant inviting blue and a work of art in itself. The rooms are fresh and beachy feeling with an extremely comfortable bed, eye catching bathroom tiles and a balcony off the bedroom and lounge. Its a short easy 2 block walk to the beach and shopping, so a fantastic location. There is a restaurant just off the lobby area and the food is amazing! I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and look forward to visiting again.","Burleigh Heads, Australia","jkmackintosh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burleigh Heads, Australia</strong>",0,5.0

Everything is new and fresh, none of that gross hotel smell. We stayed in a one room suite, the couch was amazing and felt very homey. Great for a family with lots of room for 4. Off the beaten path (above Kuhio) on Lewers, you will have to walk to the beach. Not the resort feel, but comes with friendly staff and boutique feel for a better price. For now, free wi-fi all over the hotel. Great fun for a stay/vacation in Waikiki.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Lily B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",3,5.0

There are plenty of restaurant close by. Rooms are very clean, they have just been renovated, so all the furnishings are brand new. The pool is great but a bit cold as is shaded for 1/2 the day. The staff are all excellent, and special thanks to the manager for helping us extend the booking for 2 more days. The staff at the desk are all only too willing to help with directions or advice. Food and drinks are slightly dearer than other locals, but is probably on par with the other hotels.","Newcastle, Australia","Greg R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, Australia</strong>",8,4.0

It is embodied as if it were in their DNA, such a refreshing oasis in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. The remodeled rooms are reminiscent of plantation style homes with the big couch for everyone to sit on and 'talk story'. The showers are very spacious with great water flow and easily controlled temperature, since I like my showers more on the 'hot' side than most. The restaurant Mahina & Suns creates a culinary journey that is very memorable. The he'e (octopus) salad is intriguing and the pizzas, fish, and oysters are titillating to every corner of your palette. I would highly recommend this hotel for a vacation or staycation, either way, you can't go wrong.",Waikiki,"BullaE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waikiki</strong>",0,5.0

We decided to book here based on their great opening specials. We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite for our family of four which provided us with plenty of space. We must've been one of the first families through as the building is still undergoing renovation and rooms are still being completed. Everything was new and clean which we love and the decor is fresh and vintage. We think this hotel would be great for couples or families with older children. We had two small ones and it was a bit far for them to walk to the main strip and beach. There were a couple of things which we wanted to point out. There was a door in one of the bedrooms which i am guessing can open for an interconnecting room. This door is not sound proof at all. We could hear talking very clearly in the next room and these people were not loud at all. This needs to be fixed as there is absolutely no privacy at all. Also, one of the work men knocked on the door to come inside and fix something. They knocked once and then let themselves in, without giving us a chance to even walk to the door to open it. It would be nice if they could wait a little bit in case someone in our family was not presentable! Other than that though as i said a nice, new refurbished hotel. Other than that, a great hotel overall!","Sydney, Australia","iheartaloha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",2,4.0

Did a staycation here with the wife this past weekend. Actually, we had initially wanted to dine at Chef Ed Kenney's newest restaurant in the hotel: Mahina and Suns (more on that meal later) But since the Surfjack Hotel was offering ""sneak peak"" overnight stays, we decided to kill two birds with one stone. Like I said in my title above, it was an AWESOME stay.The hotel is a refurbished low rise on bustling Lewers street (the quieter end). I'm always interested to see how these hotels get refurbished and the new Surfjack does not disappoint and definitely impresses! If you want cookie cutter Waikiki hotel resort, the Surfjack is not. Think retro chic from maybe the cool 60's era. But it's not slick like the Modern Hotel, it's more of a laid-back island feel retro. Reminds me of the old school Palm Springs hotels of the hipster bygone era. The hotel surrounds the pool (great graphics at the bottom!) and all rooms come with a lanai. We were upgraded to a 1 bedroom with living room and it was great. Nice bamboo ceilings, cool furniture, wet bar with fridge, and we even had some nice local snacks waiting for us. Big shout out for the ""local"" bathroom amenities; always great to see a hotel supporting local island products! The fan was a cool retro dark wood design and even the Soundfeak alarm clock/speaker with bluetooth was great to have in the room. Super friendly hotel staff from the front desk to housekeeping. We really liked the tile in bathroom and dual use showerheads! Big lanai was fun use outside with the morning coffee included (compliments of Mahina and Suns) and our favorite was the ""new"" room smell but not paint but of the quality furniture they had in the room (my wife wants to sofa bed in our house!), Our favorite was all the lounge areas by the pool, the little cut out rooms that you could hang out and watch the swimmers in the pool and have snacks and drinks poolside. Even the different pool and lounging furniture are way cool. Some people may not like the outdoor open-air lobby reception but then go stay at a Marriott! I can already tell that. Love that they show outdoor movies by the pool every night, even had a DJ Saturday night but not ""thumping"" music; cool retro lounge. Such a great feel by the pool (by the way we had a room in the back and was super quiet and didn't hear a peep from outside. To be honest, this review does not do it any justice. You just need to book a stay here to really enjoy this new hotel and all of the cool touches and design it has to offer; I can already tell this hotel will be constantly sold out. As for Mahina and Suns Restaurant: Ed Kenney has hit another home run with his newest addition to Honolulu. Like the way the restaurant is laid out, airy, cool and fun. We wanted to really try the menu so we had the avocado tacos, chicken, burger, ahi, rigatoni and the pizza (who knows when we will get another reservation??!!! LOLIt was all great but the chicken was the standout- the green harissa sauce was the best! Had a great, friendly , knowledgeable server: Sonda. You should ask for her to get awesome table service! Way too full for dessert so maybe next time. Mahina and Suns is a great addition to Waikiki especially as the prices are great for the area (no gouging like other restaurants in the area do. Mahina and Suns definitely gives a great value for quality food!BTW, wife spent A LOT of time at the on-site boutique Olive and Oliver. Super dangerous, if I didn't yank her out we could have spent a fortune with the cool items in there. Kudos to Courtney and Courtney working in there; super friendly and passing on lots of tips to us! And you need to buy Parker's record; cool tunes!Overall, a big thumbs up for awesome experience at the Surfjack; the room, the meals, and the overall vibe of the place. We'll be back for sure!","Honolulu, Hawaii","extravelagent</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",153,5.0

It's one of those older hotel that has completely been remodeled, it's like new and with a beautiful design throughout. It's vintage and very tasteful. the attention to details is visible not only in the decor but in everything else, from the little pool ""membership card"" to the various instructions and menus in the room. It's so nice to see these little details, at least for me, it matters. The staff was very friendly from our arrival to our departure and they made an effort to know us, our needs and be there to help with recommendations on places to go and eat around the hotel.The hotel is centrally located in Waikiki but yet very quiet, the room was very nice and the bed very comfy. I'm still in love with the decor of our room! The pool area is very nice and trendy and the coffee shop & store attached to it has some awesome design oriented objects, clothes and various articles. I couldn't resist and bought an awesome t-shirt from them!I've researched dozens of hotels in Waikiki and The Modern was my ""go to"" choice...
