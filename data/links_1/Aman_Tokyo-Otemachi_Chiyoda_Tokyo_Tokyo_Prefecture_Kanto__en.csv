The high ceiling design is just so beautiful. Checking-in on a Sunday afternoon, the hotel looks like full of people in the lobby lounge having strawberries sweets. It was kind of loud and felt the hotel has become very commercial like other hotels in Japan trying to bring customers in with special promotion. When they first opened, the restaurant and lounge were more quite and relax.Anyhow I checked into my deluxe room. It was very spacious, much nicer than I expected. Very modern style Japanese which I liked. Long lounge chair, king size bed and a big bath tub. Then I went straight to the pool and swam for an hour. The pool was nice as expected. But they didn't have any magazines to read which was disappointed to be in the day bed. The pool was empty which was good for me. I also tried their o-furo (big Japanese bath area) also quite nice.At night, I didn't want to sleep yet so I went down to the bar and this is where the biggest disappointment came in. Although the afternoon crowd was gone, the bar was quite but the bartender wasn't friendly at all. I order a glass of wine, i guess he got pissed off that I didn't like the taste of it and asked for another one. When he was making a cocktail, I said to him that it looks good, he just returned with a bitter smile. A normal person will say what he is making or tried to talk to a customer when she si alone. Then I heard him using language to his colleague that it was not something a customers should hear. Anyhow, i took my wine and left because I didn't feel I was welcomed there. Hotel Amenities: No brand name items but the smell of the products were good.They should put an espresso machine or tea set in the room.

The concierge had great recommendations arranging dinners and a tour. Front desk, dining and bellmen were great as well. Enjoyed them being fluent in English as well.

Our view looked out to Mt. Fuji....and over the Imperial Palace.......and it felt like we were floating on air. I loved the whole look of the hotel from the height of the lobby ceiling to the clean lines of our room.  In a city as busy and crowded as Tokyo ...the Aman hotel was the perfect escape....a real serene oasis . I actually had a hard time even leaving the hotel to go out.....it was so inviting and relaxing that I just wanted to hang out and enjoy it. The hotel checked all the boxes in so many ways......cleaniless, cool bar and lobby, good food at the Italian restaurant , nice spa , fantastic views from our room, a very comfortable bed. .....etc... But, there was something missing that I have to mention if order for this to be an even better hotel. The missing link....was the concierge . We were really surprised at how little information they gave us when we went to get some help. We have travelled all over the world at the best hotels and always found the concierge to be top notch. There were three people working the concierge table and yet none were able to give us much help on questions about train travel, shopping, or restaurants. We were sent to a restaurant and not told that it was on a second floor......no signs written in English .....and it took us an extra 20 minutes to even find it. . No one explained much about the train to Kyoto and since there is not anything written in English it is important that the guests at the Aman be able to get more information from the concierges. The concierges at the Aman need a lot more training.....we stayed a the Peninsula too and their concierges were first rate. If the Aman could fix this issue....they could have one of the most incredible city hotels in Asia. And, there was one other small issue but it needs to be addressed too....the staff in the restaurants were nice ; but very slow even when the restaurant was almost empty. We asked for water three times and waited ten minutes for it to be brought to the table....both at dinner and at breakfast....it was almost comical; but not right for such a high end hotel. I don't usually write anything negative;but I truly loved this hotel and would like these problems to be fixed to make it really as high end as it looks.... great service is important.","Chicago, Illinois","luckylindy0707</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",57,5.0

Situated on levels 33-38 of Otemachi Tower in Tokyo's financial district and minutes away from both Otemachi and Tokyo Station, the 84-room hotel brands itself as a sanctuary and a serene escape from the bustle of the metropolis, and you could not find descriptors more apt.I made this booking under Mr & Mrs Smith and was entitled to breakfast for two at Arva, the hotel's Italian restaurant, as a Smith Extra.AMAN TOKYOAs you exit the elevator on the 33rd floor, you are greeted by an unforgettable, breathtaking visual: a 30-metre tall ""lantern"" - a hollow roof wallpapered with seemingly glowing white washi paper rising six floors through the centre of the lobby atrium - suspends over a zen garden comprising a seasonal ikebana flower arrangement (during my winter visit, the floral centrepiece played it all Tilda Swinton in its glacial drama) in the middle of a water pond along with two rock gardens.The very minimalist proceedings limits itself to Japanese traditional textures of wood, paper and stone. A lady in a kimono, seated along a verandah-like raised walkway, plays the koto (Japanese zither) with a sense of affected urgency. Tall partitions loosely separate the dining concepts on the lobby level - Italian concept Arva as well as the hotel's Lounge and Bar - which are all gloriously illuminated by floor-to-ceiling windows with spectacular views of the Tokyo skyline.The cold stone walls, impossibly high ceilings and ethereal grandeur of the lobby experience alone makes the premises feel like the celestial fortress of a demi-god rather than simply ultra-luxurious accommodation for mere mortals like myself.Other concepts on the lobby floor include cigar lounge Fumoir as well as the hotel's Boutique, which stocks both partner retail products as well as Aman-branded merchandise and selections from the Aman skincare range.PREMIER ROOMThe airy and spacious 80sqm Premier Room plays it all traditional Japanese home meets rustic ryokan inn, with light woods, sliding shoji doors, earthy ceramics and traditional calligraphy. (Do not mistake the quaint proceedings for backwardness - a hidden flatscreen TV emerges from the table-top at the press of a remote control button like magic, and the room is equipped with a Bose sound system as well as controls for your lights, blinds and curtains.) The king-sized bed directly faces the floor-to-ceiling windows, which present a panoramic view of Tokyo Skytree and the East Tokyo skyline. Steps on both sides of the bed lead down to the minibar, a dining table and a window-side daybed which is perfect for red wine-fuelled and pensive Lost in Translation-esque moments staring into the red and white light-specked distance after night falls.The mini-bar stocks canned beverages, wines and juices as well as bottles of traditional Japanese crackers. Tea and coffee-making facilities, as well as a Nespresso coffee machine, are also available.One of the Premier Room’s key features is its traditional stone bath, which is modelled after the traditional Japanese furo deep-soak bath. The bath experience comes equipped with generous quantities of woody - almost whisky-esque - Japanese cypress bath salts as well as a paper manual with instructions on bathing and Japanese bathing etiquette (“Disrobe...rinse your body, start with the feet and shins, then onto your legs…”). The hot bath is intended for warmth, relaxation, improving blood circulation as well as healing the body from tension and fatigue. Any soaping and removal of shameful bodily filth is meant to be done separately, using either the Oke wood bucket whilst sitting naked on a stool or the available modern shower facilities, with double vanities and Aman’s house range of bath amenities at your disposal.As the hotel was informed prior to my arrival that my stay coincides with my birthday week, the staff thoughtfully prepared for me a platter of chocolates as well as a bottle of red wine for the occasion.WELLNESS AND AMAN SPAThe 2,500sqm zen-like Aman Spa spans two entire floors, comprising a Japanese bath, steam room and eight treatment rooms. Their signature treatments, ranging from body scrubs and acupressure facials to hot stone massages and herbal foot baths, incorporate kampo (Japanese traditional medicine), seasonal herbs and local oils.On the wellness front, guests have access to a fitness centre, yoga and pilates studios, changing rooms with steam rooms and a traditional onsen-style stone bath, as well as a sleek 30-metre indoor pool, most of which offer breathtaking views of urban Tokyo.The swimming pool is all sorts of magnificent, resembling a celestial fortress of a demi-god in the day and transforming into a futuristic J-RPG final boss dungeon at night, with the formidably soaring pillars seemingly penetrating the white heavenly skies above. I was advised by the staff that a magical glimpse of Mt. Fuji might be possible from the pool at 6.30am every morning if the skies feel particularly charitable that day.Elsewhere, unlike international business hotels like Conrad Tokyo, the hotel is firm about its onsen nudity policies, so I had to strip away all modesties before I could revel in the red-faced, sweaty and deep breathing aquatic proceedings. Fortunately, like your in-room Japanese furo deep-soak bath, there are shower stalls available post-onsen such that it is not necessary to go through the (very public) traditional bucket-and-stool bathing ritual.DININGBreakfast at the hotel is served at Arva, the Italian restaurant on the lobby floor which plays it all clean-lined wood partitions and magnificent floor-to-ceiling windows which extend beyond 98 feet in height. Guests can opt for either a traditional Japanese breakfast (think baked seasonal fish, Japanese rolled omelet with grated radish, marinated seasonal vegetable and steamed rice or congee, with seasonal fruit) or an American-style breakfast comprising your choice of three pieces of side meat (I opted for crispy bacon, black pepper bacon and Canadian bacon) along with a bread basket and fruit plate. Arva prides itself on its use of locally-sourced ingredients rooted in Italian family-style techniques, and sample offerings include wild boar ragout with truffle, grilled barracuda with roasted cauliflower and anchovy, ravioli with sparkling enope squid (i.e. firefly squid) with fava beans.Just next door is the Lounge by Aman, the hotel's lounge and bar which overlooks the Imperial Palace Gardens. The lounge is a popular destination for their picturesque Black Afternoon Tea, which dramatically juxtaposes the lounge's monochromatic sensibilities with the bright, eye-popping colours of the sweet and savoury afternoon tea offerings - think berry and plain scones, mixed berry soup with champagne espuma, truffle quiche, celeriac mont blanc, snow crab sandwich, chicken fricassée, colourful petit sweets (your choice of four from a selection presented within a travel trunk) and a Christmas Ball encasing pastille surprises. Not since Peacock Alley at Waldorf Astoria Bangkok has an afternoon tea experience so tantalised my senses, both visual and gustatory.The adjacent Bar area sees mixologists serving tipples with a decidedly Japanese slant. Bar counter seats directly face the Tokyo skyline, and the glorious view is best exploited in the evening when guests can partake in confessional whispers over seasonal cocktails - I have come across both strawberry as well as black-themed cocktail menus - while appreciating the splendid transitional sunset experience. Savoury bites are also available for the peckish.Located on the ground floor, The Café by Aman offers casual French cuisine by an ""Otemachi Forest"" lush setting at the base of the office tower, while the latest concept to join the property, Musashi by Aman, serves exquisite sushi over a Hinoki wooden counter.CONCLUDING THOUGHTSThe hotel offers a revelatory, game-changing, ultra-luxurious sanctuary experience which would likely redefine and recalibrate one's expectations towards luxury hotel accommodation. I simply cannot wait to experience another Aman property.","Singapore, Singapore","secretlifeoffatbacks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",215,5.0

We realised that we left a pair of snow shoes we have purchased at a Shibuya ramen restaurant. We called Miki and she contacted the restaurant and got the new shoes from them.

I've read reviews that the service has been slightly subpar for a hotel of this price tag - can't really say much on that as we didn't interact with the staff much other than to book a shuttle back to the airport, which worked out without any issue. Check-in/checkout was also fine. I also read the food was not that great either - that at least I can attest to. the breakfast was fine since it came included when I booked through my card, but I sincerely don't want to know how much it actually cost because it was not worth a remark or even a photo on my insta story. The cocktails at the lounge were phenomenal. Didn't have any food, but enjoyed the live music. The pool and hot tub in the spa area were true highlights.

We booked multiple suites for our family getaway months in advance. Looked forward to it with a great anticipation as we’ve been wanting to stay at Aman Tokyo for a while. Pretty much on night one, we knew it was going to be a letdown, and what a shame. The check in process was not perfect. The staff started talking with one person in our group and then in the middle moved over to talk to another person to give the rest of the information about our stay. Annoying.The concierge was pretty great before we checked in making a bunch of arrangements for our family. But they made some mistakes. They don’t even know when their own restraints are open and closed. They told us their sushi restaurant is closed and we had to book another place just to find out their restaurant is indeed open that day. Even the restaurant receptionist couldn’t believe it. You can tell they are inexperienced. The phone lines are always busy. Some nights no one picks up the phone. They promise to have someone call you back. Never happened. Extremely annoying. Should this happen at a place like Aman?The worst. The food. Room service and the breakfast are so extraordinarily mediocre, it’s actually mind boggling. With all the resources they have at their disposal, this is what they came up with? Even their Japanese food is not so great. How can this be?It says call Laundry for shoe shine in their guide. When I call, they ask “do you want to clean your own shoes?” Um...no. “Let me find out and call you back”. Really?!?!My young child was sick. Can you get us something to help the fever? The first thing they say to you every time is “this will cost you this much and that will cost you this much”. We missed the last hotel we stayed where one of us got sick and they brought in a whole kit and caboodle of medicine and amenities to help you get better without any concern for recovering cost. They actually cared for their guests’ health. How about that for a concept?! We are spending tens of thousands of dollars at this place and this is all you get? Sure the rooms and nice and the view is great. But little things go a long way when it comes to luxury hotels. Aman tragically falls short....even after some heart to heart talk with their manager on duty. Not much improvement. Stay at many other luxury hotels in Tokyo at half the price.

This review is a little late as I stayed for the first time in August 2017, but the quality has remained consistently excellent. I don't think there is a single item that I can fault about the property.Let's start with the rooms. I stayed in a Premier. The room is beautiful, bright and spacious: an example of clean Japanese design, with every comfort. The bed is slightly raised from the lounging area, thus affording beautiful views over the city. The bathroom features a very nice deep-soak bathtub and enjoys the same views over the city.The lobby, restaurant, bar and communal areas on the reception floor are stunning. Every corner enjoys gorgeous views. I particularly appreciated the cigar lounge (the Fumoir); it seems that Japan doesn't have a big smoking culture, so having a nice ambience to enjoy cigars is a rare treat for Tokyo. The whisky selection is outstanding and reasonably priced considering the level of the establishment. Service impeccable.The pool is another masterpiece of design. It offers incredible views (have a swim at sunrise or sunset!) and is a very serene environment. You can order drinks and nibbles there, which is a plus.What really stood out for me was the level of service from the Concierge team. In a city that might be somehow difficult to navigate for a foreigner, the Concierge at Aman made the real difference throughout my stay. They were able to book the hardest-to-get restaurants and, more importantly, recommend places that would have been impossible to find for a foreigner. Truly impeccable.Overall, an outstanding experience and certainly one of the very best city hotels in the world.",London,"eleph4nt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",52,5.0

I realize the price of the room is higher but not that much more than other hotels I've be in...but the level of service is disproportionately higher than most. As an employee, regardless of how much I am paid, one would think you would want to be on top of your game and do the best you can...but apparently other hotels didn't get that memo. But with the Aman Tokyo, they clearly did and whatever the company culture is or training they provide, it certainly works! They did not disappoint. This would be a great case study for hotel managers world wide.Property is as luxurious and perfect as expected. Luxury without being ostentatious, every details has been thoughtfully designed and executed. I appreciate the balance of both traditional and contemporary Japanese architecture throughout...from the common areas to the rooms to the spa to the gym...etc. Everything positive I have to say is reflected on the other reviews here and other publications. It is truly as magical as people say it is (despite being in the center of Tokyo FiDi). I was fortunate that they upgraded me to a suite (which was a real treat) but I understand even the regular rooms are sufficiently sized and has the same level of detail in design.As much travel as I do for work, and as many hotels as I stay (high end and low end), it all comes down to the staff and the service. It was perfect. It was understated, personable and flexible. Luxury does not mean over the top and overt display of brown nosing but rather considerate but personalized service that is not based on a check list. Staff are given a lot of trust and leeway to exercise discretion with management support. That is what works and why it works. From the 2 guys (from Ghana and Uganda) on arrival, to all the check in staff, supervisor Yuko, the concierge team, housekeeping team, room service, spa, etc...it was consistent throughout. They remember you by name and greet you regardless when they bump into you in the hallways. Really felt like ""home"" as that's important when traveling on long business trips. They are constantly ahead of you and anticipating what you might need. As you approach the elevator, they ask if you need a taxi so you don't have to wait. They coil up your charging cords in your room (I know small detail). They noticed I took a bath the night before, so during turn down the next night, housekeeping automatically lit the ""candle"" in the bathroom anticipating I would want to do the same that night. It's as if they kept thinking ""how would I like to be treated or would expect if I was staying here?"" while doing their work. I give a lot of credit to the staff because as much training as you can give, it only works if the staff put their heart into it. And they certainly did (despite being a job). Highly recommended! And would recommend to hotel managers worldwide to stay at Aman properties (incognito) to experience and learn from their staff.","New York City, New York","CLGT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",16,5.0

Make sure to grab a cocktail as the sun sets along the towering glass windows before heading out to dinner. The colors that fill the space are spectacular. So it comes as a shock that you are even more WOWED by views from the glamorous, enormous suites. Ours was a corner suite on the 37th floor and arguably the nicest hotel room we've ever stayed in. The room is split into two sides with two bathrooms, one work space, dining room, kitchenette and living room area. The master that resides on the other side is same in size; however, it's peppered with the perfect amount of storage space, sitting areas, and the most 'wow' factored master bath, which includes a bathtub that kisses the side of the building and feels like an out-of-body infinity pool experience hovering over the city. You will feel the need to take a million photos of the space, as it is jaw dropping.

It is, without a doubt, the most stunning city hotel I've had the pleasure to visit. The soaring lobby has to be seen to be believed; amazing, panoramic views from the restaurant and lounge, a beautiful spa, pool, and gym. The guest rooms are also stupendous with similar panoramic views over much of Tokyo. I felt like I was in my own private, luxurious cocoon, with all the expected five star amenities one could want. Sleep was deep and uninterrupted by noise, light, or temperature. Fantastic air-conditioning, the lack of which is deal-breaker for me.I ate an included breakfast daily - the same set menu items but quite generous including juice, fruit, yogurt, a choice of a couple of egg entrees, meat, and various breads. There is also a Japanese breakfast option which I did not try. I had two meals in the lounge and both were tasty and reasonably priced. Together these choices seemed a bit limited, but the property sits on top of the Otemashi station and there were a number of excellent small restaurants (as well as a gourmet market) on the lowest level to choose from.The service from Aman staff ranged from excellent to very good, with one snooty lounge employee. They were unfailingly polite, deferential, and helpful. The wait staff in the restaurant and lounge were young and seemed a bit inexperienced; they forgot a couple of requests and were not as attentive as one might like. What seemed to be lacking was an overall personal touch. For example, I expect five star properties to reach out to me before the stay to inquire about transportation, spa, or restaurant reservations. I heard nothing from the Aman, although I did email them and there was a prompt response. I was not greeted by name and only the concierge seemed to remember me. No one asked if I was enjoying my stay or if there was anything I needed. It is unclear to me if the seeming lack of warmth is cultural, Aman-based, a combination of the two. Or maybe my expectations were unreasonable. One final comment about relative price. The hard product was worth every penny/yen spent. But would I return? Probably not, when there are so many other luxury options in Tokyo that provide more all-around value for comfort, service, and luxury.","St Paul, MN","Spacrawler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St Paul, MN</strong>",232,5.0

However, it is located in the business district so it is not interesting as far a restaurants or other services for travelers. If you like jogging, it is close by the Imperial Palace, a great place for jogging. Common areas:The lobby is huge and beautifully decorated. It's very spacious for Tokyo. The pool and gym are world class. Room:One of the largest rooms I have stayed in. And the view of the Imperial Palace is pretty amazing too. I love the simple minimal esthetic. The bathroom is spacious and definitely love the heated floor. It's super in everyway. Service:There is room for improvement. Like most of high end hotels, front desk leads you to a seat while they take care of the check-in and registration. Unlike other high end hotels that I have been to in that no drinks were offered while waiting. A simple glass of water would suffice. Some sort of cold juice even better. There were too many non-guests using the restaurants so there is no seat for lunch other than the bars. That is a real disappointment. There should be some seats allotted for guests. Shouldn't that be one of the perks of staying there? Service at the pool was very nice. Pool people promptly bring out water, menu, and goggles. Food was more than adequate. Love the fries that came with the sliders. Cocktails could be better. They lack that oomph. But I am picky. Of the many cocktails I have tried (from the Ritz in Paris to Sukhothai in Bangkok), very few standout such as the mojito and margarita at the Ritz in Laguna Beach. Had a few rounds but none amazing or memorable. Being a picky person that I am, this hotel definitely worth staying when in Tokyo.","San Diego, California","SDWanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",125,5.0

I would have given a 4.5 stars if was possible.The location of the hotel is great and the lobby is spectacular, the views of the city are unparalleled.We usually book through Fine Hotels and Resorts and most of the times we get upgraded.The hotel was full and there were no upgrades available, however at check in, they mentioned that because my room was the highest level before a Suite, I would not have been able to been upgraded as upgrades are within same room category.This might be true for certain hotels, but when you stay at an Aman hotel and pay close to $2000/night, usually you are upgraded even if you are in a different category room like a suite. This is what differentiates a true luxury hotel, regardless of their official policy.I imagine the upgrade would have been done to a Suite if rooms were available, but I thought that was something had never heard in any Aman.The room was spacious, nicely decorated and beautiful with spectacular views over the city.We were a little disappointed about the welcome gifts as they were a few strawberries and crackers. No chocolate or anything for turn down service.We did have the traditional Japanese breakfast, which I did like and was very nicely presented.The pool is spectacular overlooking the city.After staying at the Hoshinoya and the Aman, I did enjoy more the stay at Hoshinoya, however the views, architecture and rooms are spectacular at the Aman.

It is, though. A hotel that much like the cuisine that shines because of simplicity and not unnecessary addition. Clean lines, high ceilings, nods everywhere to Shintoism and nature, the hotel is breathtaking in it's clean lines, space and quiet. The hotel sits on the top floors of the Otemachi Tower close to the East Gate of The Imperial Palace. The Aman is perfectly situated in the financial district of Tokyo, close to subways and an easy walk to the Imperial Palace. You can easily explore Tokyo without needing a taxi. The lobby of the hotel is an open, high-cielinged homage to modern and sleek design. With no clutter or unneeded accessories, the giant plume of cherry blossoms erupting from the reflecting pool in the middle of the lobby was captivating. Do yourself a favor and have a final evening drink after your night out, the music, the lighting, and the mood of the place will transport you to another state of mind. The hallways to the rooms are beautifully lit, wide and totally unpopulated. Sconces containing sprigs of greenery dot the hallway which you will be tempted to take in but once the door to your room enters will you will be drawn to floor to the ceiling windows laying Tokyo and its maze of possibility before you.Your hotel room is beautifully decorated with simple decorations and nothing that pulls you from the amazing view. The shower and tub also have the same amazing view of the city (I am hoping the glass was not see through because I could not bear to close the blinds as the city is the ultimate night light).Finally, what catapults this hotel into the GREATEST category are the individuals that work there. Without exception, they are lovely. Truly, lovely. They really do care. It's not hospitality, they are kind and helpful and gracious (as were all the locals I met). Please look up Mikki at the front desk who is exceptional. A beautiful person inside and out, I will never forget her kindness and help.Make good use of the concierge- as with all Aman's they have the excursion program down!

Even as the ""smallest"" room, it was so spacious as to echo! I definitely don't think a larger room was necessary for our family. The room itself consisted of a loft type area, featuring a King bed (and requested, fluffy cot for our son), TV stand separator and a step down, followed by a sitting/eating area against window seats and floor-to-ceiling windows. The bathroom features sliding doors and gorgeous decor. The separate toilet room was a nice feature, as someone could be getting ready at the double sinks or bathing at the shower or tub and not worry about a privacy issue. The floors were always warm. What impressed me the most about the suite was the large soaking tub (ofuro). It came with fresh salts and herbs, and overlooked the Imperial Palace. Wow, what a view! The Aman takes up the top few floors of this Otomachi building, so you go through other areas to get upstairs. But the entire time you are attended to like royalty. We used concierage several times both prior to and during the trip and found them to be extremely helpful and patient. Our package included breakfast for three, which was very nice as the expansive spread would have been out of our budget otherwise. My husband felt so pampered by the breakfast; additionally, when we arrived we receive ""immune boosting shots"" of some sort of juice. Hubby was VERY sick, so he definitely appreciated this. The management sent him bonus fruit and get well wishes too. We had one hitch in the trip, but it was resolved with care by management. Our son's cot was changed one morning and housekeeping hadn't noticed his stuffed animals rolled up into the bedding. When we returned in the evening, he was very upset to find them missing. Housekeeping and management took time late at night to find his stuffed animals, and also sent us gifts the next day as well in apology for the trouble. I can't say enough about the experience of staying here. It is an event in itself. The building is a work of art. The pool/spa floor has amazing views of everything you'd possibly want to see in Tokyo. And the experience of swimming ABOVE the city was something. Hubby and I got very bad sunburns climbing Mt. Fuji the day prior, so we appreciated all the pampering the spa had to offer. The ladies spa featured an enormous soaking tub overlooking the city, and huge, private showers. The locker room had individual vanities with spa lotions and necessities. I'm not sure what the lotions were, but they were the only thing I tried in Tokyo that soothed my painfully sunburned face. Additionally, I am big on cleanliness and this place was spotless. It even smelled different than any other hotel I have visited: some sort of sweet citrus that I couldn't get enough of.If our budget ever allows, we will definitely be back!","Strongsville, Ohio","jlhttravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Strongsville, Ohio</strong>",43,5.0

I adore minimalist design and the lobby of this hotel just blew my mind. I’ve never seen a more gorgeous space in my life - worth visiting if only for the lobby. I arrived early in the morning and the room was ready by 9am and I’d been upgraded to a premier room. Rooms are huge, perfectly designed and maintained. Note the whole hotel is very crisp, clean and somewhat simple in design so may not suit everyone’s tastes. However the quality of the design is of the highest standard. Views are stunning - even on a bad day. I loved everything in the room from the bathtub at the window, the lounge area and the out of this world bed. Best bed ever. Tokyo struggles to compete with your room I promise you.The one area I’ve heard AMAN hotels excel in is service. Whilst they certainly exceeded in quality of the hotel I did not find the service to be exceptionally good - I did not find it as good as the Mandarin Oriental Tokyo for example. Everyone was friendly and the early check in was much appreciated but nothing memorable happened to make the service stand out - I wasn’t greeted by name, given a complimentary drink on check-in or asked how my stay was going. First world problems but if I compare this to say Claridges, London, they should do better.On to the amenities. The pool WOW. That’s all. WOW. I had a hot stone massage which was perfection and the gym was great too. The breakfast was fab! The American breakfast is vast and high quality. Aside from that my dining experiences at the hotel were quite poor. I had lunch in the lounge but the host would not offer me a window seat despite there being several available. Twice I went to the bar and had champagne and twice the glass was only half-filled (this truly annoyed me) and dinner at Arva was well below standard.Realize i’m moaning a lot here but this is the most expensive hotel in Tokyo and AMAN has an incredible reputation so my expectations were high.I would still highly recommend this hotel and gladly come back.

I did not know what to expect and wondered how Aman could be translated in a bustling city. Aman is a special destination within unfettered landscapes. Aman Tokyo seems to transcend conventional luxury city hotels. Taking the top floors of a high rise office building allows for spectacular views. The design is effortless and calming incorporating natural elements of stone wood and metal. The natural design is seamlessly found throughout the whole hotel. You enter on the street level and whisked up in an express elevator to the 40 something floor. You are greeted by gracious staff members and enter a soaring common space that blows you away. The floor to ceiling glass walls offer spectacular views of tokyo. The bar, lounge and restaurants fill the perimeter, while a sunken in common living room offers comfortable lounge seating with beautiful zen rock installation. The center of the room features a beautiful water feature with a seasonal grand arrangement. Rooms are simple, spacious and beautifully designed that allows the million dollar views of Tokyo. The best feature in the suite is the Onsen style bath. Come on! The views, the views, the views!Service exemplifies the Aman philosophy. I changed hotels when my mother arrived (she like the Peninsula Hotels) and it was night and day in the feel and service. One cannot explain, but rather have to experience. Spa was one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had in my life. I love to spa wherever I go in the world and this one is bar none the best. I selected a “journey” experience that was truly heavenly. The facilities are insanely beautiful and well appointed. Food was great at breakfast, dinner was a bit disappointing. Service was amazing. The bar and lounge is a wonderful experience at night. It is a very Sexy ambiance.

From the start, the concierge, particularly, Yuriko, were super helpful in landing some difficult restaurant reservations: including the highlight of my trip, a personally prepared meal by a famous yakiniku chef at his restaurant counter. The facilities are stunning. The lobby is an architectural wonder. The rooms are by far the biggest and sleekest of Tokyo. Beautiful views, amazing dual vanity bathroom with rain shower and relaxing japanese bath (I used it daily!). Bed and layout were classic Aman. Housekeeping was consistent and discrete, and rarely bumped into them or were bothered in the morning.Finally, definitely take advantage of the pool in the spa area. I would exercise, work up a good sweat and then dip in the pool, come out and relax on the day-bed where a cold towel and fresh berries awaited. Simply zen!Breakfast was a-la-carte, which i personally prefer, but if you prefer buffets as is the standard in tokyo then you might be dissapointed.

My partner and I have returned to the property five times this year alone, and every time we go back I'm reminded of how truly exceptional their hard product is. If I could replicate one of their palace-view rooms in my own home, I would. As other reviewers have noted, the Aman Tokyo doesn't always meet the Aman standard for superlative hospitality, but they are improving. Breakfast service, which we'd found to be slow and disorganized on prior visits, was efficient, friendly, and on point this time. For instance, there was an American guest one table over from us who put in a very complicated breakfast order (he also nattered on his phone the whole time, but that's a whole other story), and the staff handled it with grace and accuracy. Also special kudos to Kei, who remembered my breakfast order *from five months ago* when we went downstairs the first morning. He's lovely and professional, exactly what an Aman employee should be. Likewise, the uneven concierge services seem to be improving. We had numerous requests on this trip (dinners, concert tickets, various appointments, etc.) and they handled all of them with aplomb. One critique: when we first checked in, we requested a late check-out on our departure day because we had a nighttime flight at Narita. The front desk staff approved our request, and we went upstairs happy. Five minutes later, the front desk phoned our room to say no, actually, they'd extended the late checkout offer to us in error and we would have to pay a half-day rate (which is over $500) to stay late. I called them back and said I was extremely disappointed that they could not extend the courtesy of a late checkout to us, especially since 1) they'd promised it to us already and 2) we visit the resort 5+ times a year (our first stay of 2018 is already booked, mind you). The on-duty manager (Ken, I believe) eventually granted us a complimentary late check out but he was quite rude about it, and the entire exchange left us feeling annoyed. If you mistakenly offer a benefit to a guest, don't renege on it and attempt to make the guest feel bad, especially if they are returning clients! Again, it was one of those unfortunate instances at the Aman where blind adherence to rules trumped basic principles of hospitality. So the Aman still has some considerable work to do here. We noticed that they have a new GM (seems the hotel has been through a few since it opened), and we wish her much luck in the role. We'd still rather stay at the Aman than anywhere else in Tokyo, but a hotel like this should always be striving continuously for improvement.","Long Island City, New York","ValeP36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island City, New York</strong>",21,5.0

We checked into Aman after a 4 night stellar stay at the Peninsula Tokyo, where we were upgraded from a room to a mid-tier suite and treated to to/from transportation in the hotel's Rolls - a lot to live up to, right?We were greeted on the ground floor and escorted up to the 33rd floor for check-in. We arrived at roughly 2:15 pm, so our room was not ready - although we were on the Amex FHR program, no worries, because I thought they might be reading me for an upgrade. Nope, not the case. I moved from a fabulous suite in my previous hotel to the highest level room (that I booked), no upgrade. So, as the check-in staff is singing me the praises of the room that I booked, I'm silently stewing and wanting to run back to my previous accommodations. How are we to survive in this room for 2 nights, I wondered?No withstanding the fact that I didn't get an upgrade, I did discover some pleasures and comforts. The view from the room was majestic - from the 37th floor, you could view Tokyo in a whole new perspective. The shower was incredible, spacious, great water pressure, and had its own stunning view of the city. I loved the bath toiletries (Aman brand) and the welcome chocolates, and min-fridge sodas (we didn't have any, but loved having the option). The bath robe was extremely comfortable and I used it throughout the day. The bed however, was exceptionally uncomfortable and I probably couldn't have tolerated it beyond the 2 nights. There was nothing really special about the room besides the view and the shower (which gets the highest awards). The heated bathroom floor made the room temp uncomfortable in July). On night 2, I realized that our room wasn't totally ready when we checked in because we received new stuff at turn down - herbs for the bath, good night message card in bamboo sleeve, etc. wish I had the herbs on night 1, could have made use of them - oh well.Throughout our visit, I felt like we were being watched in the creepiest kind of way. We didn't make a move without someone stumbling over us to ask, ""can I help you"" or my interpretation of ""where do you think you are going/doing"". At Peninsula, I felt cared for, here I felt the property was king, it was cared for.What I did enjoy was the food. Although the reviews on food have been mediocre, I found the offerings fabulous. Breakfast was delicious each morning - the freshest fruit I've ever had. Service needs some attention as previously reported, but the food was great and thoughtfully presented. We tried the ""Black Bar"" one evening, but it fell short because the menu of cocktails lacked description. Paying $26+ for a drink titled Black Magic without any idea of its constituents is not my idea of a good time or way to spen my money. The bartender kindly described each of the 15+ drinks for me, but that is just nonsense - when I wanted to reorder, I couldn't remember any of that and just decided not too - ending the evening frustrated versus enlightened.I also found the common spaces very attractive and easy to relax in - this was a plus for Aman. The gym was quite nice, spacious, with great equipment. Yet, the gym refreshments didn't show up until I was leaving on the last morning. The Japanese blueberry was a delicious and refreshing post work-out treat- wish I'd had that on my first morning. Oh well, lot's of wishes.I arranged transportation services from the hotel to the airport and the cost was well beyond that quoted from other luxury properties in the area - no Rolls on this trip, just your regular old taxi...at a Rolls fee.There are elements of Aman Tokyo that I adored, public spaces, the dining room, breakfast offerings and prep, the gym equipment and space, the spa appearance (canceled appointment when I discovered I was getting what I paid for, nothing more), my shower, and the view. But I didn't depart with that ""cared for"" feeling, something that makes a property truly exclusive, not the price tag. A property with an ethos around wellness should do this better than anyone else and this property doesn't.","New York City, New York","Advourner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",72,3.0

Fortunately, Aman Tokyo did not disappoint! In fact, it exceeded our high expectations. As we were traveling with a large family group of seven, we asked for three contiguous rooms on a non-smoking floor. Fortunately, the Aman was able to oblige. Although we booked the rooms through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts, this constraint meant they weren’t able to accommodate an upgrade. No matter - the rooms were incredibly spacious and well-designed. The decor of the Aman Tokyo is modern Japanese. It’s very muted, serene - done in slate and natural woods. Everything is well designed and ergonomic. The layout of the room is really genius: a desk area at the “top” of the room, the bedding and side tables in the middle, and at the “foot” of the room a seating area and banquette / daybed along the windows. It really works and provides “micro-environments” that optimize the space. The view we had (over-looking the Imperial Gardens) was spectacular, especially on the clear nights. The desk design was great, and the audio-visual worked flawlessly (I used both a Chromecast through the HDMI input, and also used the in-room Bose speaker via Bluetooth.) The controls by the nightstands at the head of the bed were well designed, well-labeled and operated the rooms lighting, blackout curtains and temperature controls. (And the blackout curtains worked exceptionally well - crucial since the sun rose at around 4:30am this time of year.) One slight complaint - the remote control for the TV was strictly Japanese and complicated. Took some trial and error to figure it out. The Wifi was free and fast.  The bed and bedding was comfortable, although it was clear that the king-sized bed was actually two mattresses with a seam between them. As seams go, it was tolerable. The bathroom too was well designed. The Neorest washlet was amazing - the toilet raised and lowered its lid (and flushed) automatically. There was a two-headed shower, with both wand and “rain” showerheads. Floors were heated and there was a great set of shampoos and amenities, as well a great towels and robes. The Japanese soaking tub was a welcome relief at the end of long days. The FHR benefits included breakfast, which we utilized every day. Breakfast was fantastic, and options included a Japanese set breakfast, or varieties of western options including pancakes, waffles, eggs, bagels, yogurt, etc. The waitstaff were efficient and kind, and the food was delicious. We utilized room service several times, and it was also fast, hot, and delicious.  We didn’t utilize the lobby much, but it was always a delight to re-enter that serene space after a busy day in the Tokyo streets and subways. We occasionally used the Library (which is a great space) as a gathering point. The pool is truly amazing - on the 33 Floor with panoramic views of the Tokyo skyline. The pool room was quite hot and the water quite warm - both of which suit me - but possibly too intense for some. My wife used the yoga room several times, which she said was amongst the best spaces she’d seen in a hotel.We began using the concierge services well before our visit and the team certainly worked hard on our behalf. In addition to restaurant reservations, they helped us with a tour of Kamakura and an outing to a local baseball game. They were efficient and able to arrange all of this via email, which was our preferred means of communication. We found the location of the hotel (literally on top of underground access to both Tokyo Station and Otemachi Station) to be ideal. After a week in the Aman Tokyo, I can say it’s surely amongst our favorite hotels in the world. It’s really well designed, thoughtful, balanced, appropriate and understated.

The facilities (beautiful lobby, oversized lap pool, gym, spa, Japanese bath, library, restaurants...) and rooms (ours was facing the imperial gardens) are super beautiful and the Aman Tokyo could potentially play at the top of the Tokyo luxury hotels league......However: 1- In our room, the electric shades stoped working on day 2 and we had to spend a night without windows black-out. 2- At the restaurant, I waited 35mn the first day at breakfast for a white omelette and no one would offer me coffee refill. On the second day, I asked for one hard boiled egg and one soft boiled egg and the waiter said it was not possible. Even at classic business 4* hotels I was able to get this. Unbelievable. Also the restaurant staff is clearly untrained as they seem to go around inefficiently (the staff outnumbers the guests yet no one is there to clear the table or offer water or coffee refills). 3- Finally, in a very strange fashion, when you enter or exit the hotel, sometimes the staff is there to greet you with a cheer or assist you, and other time they ignore you perfectly - almost as if you were transparent. Very inconsistent.We were just at the 4 seasons Kyoto before staying at the Aman Tokyo, and clearly the Aman has a lot of work and training to do in order to catch up with the seamless, perfect service at a four seasons.Will not stay there again.","Paris, France","chayato</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",120,4.0

It was one of the anticipated highlights of our trip being able to stay at one of the most revered properties in the city. It did not disappoint. Located on the 33rd floor of the Otemachi Tower, we exited the elevator into a grand space that was created to give a sense of spacial openness while also showcasing the views of Tokyo through it's panoramic floor to ceiling glass windows. The checkin process was very smooth and easy. Our rooms were beautifully appointed showcasing the heights of corporate hotel/resort design. The showers and baths overlooking the city through a floor to ceiling glass view was nothing shy of amazing. The staff was amongst the best we encountered during our stay, and graciously helped us with every request and need. Our only dings on the property were some mild scuffs on the walls of our room, which upon reporting this to the manager, was immediately cleaned up. The breakfast was also disappointing, feeling very skimpy on the items ordered. For the hefty cost of our breakfast, they easily could have provided a better experience here. And we were shocked to see that in today's age (2017), the Aman Tokyo actually offered an entire smoking floor?! Seriously? That in our view was an extremely bad decision on their part, and showed very poor judgement when the majority of ""exclusive high end"" resorts and hotels in most developed countries now ban smoking entirely from the premises. There's simply no up-side to offering smoking rooms no days. Smokers can go outside to do something that's offensive to most and leaves a lasting smell in the walls and rooms. But other than those few complaints, the staff and the management went out of their way to make sure our stay was the best it could be, and the design and architecture of the property is by far the best you can find in Tokyo (we've previously stayed at the Ritz Tokyo among others, and this bested them all). We would happily return and would recommend this property to anyone who wants to have spectacular views of Tokyo during their stay matched with an incredibly designed experience.","San Francisco, California","SFtravelgeek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",32,4.0

You'd never know you're in the city -- and never heard anyone in the hallway.I've stayed in every good and great hotel in Tokyo over years of doing business here, and this is not worth double or triple or quadruple the price of those places. Great location however. Food, again, is average but certainly not great. I would stick with Western food. The Japan food was mediocre -- go to the restaurants in the basement of the building for MUCH better food. The 33rd floor lobby is spectacular, but more suited to the public using it, than to hotel guests feeling cocooned and feeling specially treated.I've stayed in many Amans around the world (for 25 years!) and loved them.

Tokyo is always a tricky place for high end hotels. Places like Park Hyatt, Ritz Carlton and Palace Imperial seem like staying behind of the new trend of hotel standard. Their rooms stink of old cigarettes. The Lobbies are tiny and look a bit reserved. The service is more the feeling of yes this is obligatory rather than personal.Aman Tokyo is one of a few city hotels in their collection. It is not really a business hotel. During my stay I could hardly see one's portfolio discussed over the table, nor some deal making dinners. People here seem relaxed, casual yet stylish. It is, however, not a resort hideaway like most of other Amens. The facilities here, tough all of top quality, are not self sufficient enough for guests to stay in the hotel during the stay. For example, while the library contains a good selection of books, one could hardly enjoy quietly the offerings as food and drinks are provided there as well. There are 2 restaurants- one in the Lobby area where breakfast and Italian food is served. The Aman Cafe near the entrance on the ground level offers casual French bistro food and crepe. Mind you, there will be many outside guests- we had to wait to be seated several times. The room design, with the emphasis on wood, paper and stone, is a great bland of contemporary and Japanese tradition. The writing desk, the bed, and the sitting area are all facing the same direction that is looking over the palace. The pool is really the highlight of the hotel. I am not a big fan of some hotels' choice of putting standard pools with swimming lanes, as however ok I am as a swimmer, I am usually not planning to improve my swimming gestures, nor my speed for a lap, during my stay in hotels. I prefer somewhere I could relax, somewhere I could swim a bit, while enjoying the good surrounding. The pool here ticks all the boxes. It is long enough to have a good lap. It is well designed so that your mind is calmed once you stepped into the pool area. You have a great view for the sunset. The only slight complain is the training of the staff in the main restaurant during breakfast. Coffee was served without sugar. We ordered twice a latte, the first time came a regular coffee with milk on the side, the second a more normal latte with mixed scotched milk and coffee. One may decide on its house style of latte, but be consistent and don't serve different things under the same name. Also first day bread was served with jams, the second without. These are really small things which don't affect your enjoyment of the meal, but it is an initial alarm for the management to better implement its service standard.I think this hotel is outstanding in the limited luxury Hotel offering in Tokyo andI will definitely come back to Aman Tokyo.

A note to the families considering the Aman Tokyo, if you have young children (under 12), I would suggest another hotel in the area.

Wow. My partner and I can be jaded travelers- I formerly worked in operations for one of the world's top tour companies, so I've seen it all when it comes to fine hotels, and the two of us have racked up stays in countless luxury properties around the globe. But the Aman Tokyo truly sets a new standard for hospitality, room design, and effortless elegance and comfort. The property is stunning, from the dramatic lobby to the serene pool to the plushly-stocked spa area. Service is gracious and warm, with staff members who welcome you ""home"" each time you return to the hotel. And it indeed feels like home from the moment you check in- the rooms are modern and luxuriously spare, with ingenious decor features like a compartment that disguises the TV (is there anything more foul than a widescreen marring an otherwise chic room?), heated floors in the bathroom (essential) and a built-in window seat that beckons you to lounge and gaze at the Tokyo skyline for hours. Oh, and the rooms are lit so impeccably that they'd make Quasimodo look like Ryan Gosling. The basalt tub in our Premier Room was a major highlight of our stay- we spent hours looking at the city lights and drinking tea while immersed in the yuzu-scented bathwater. We also appreciated touches like nightly snack deliveries of fresh rice crackers and yummy Japanese sweets. We didn't eat dinner or lunch at the restaurant, but courtesy of jet lag we stopped by the Bar on our first night at the hotel and my partner had a delectable green tea cocktail (my milk tea cocktail was solid though less impressive). We also enjoyed full Japanese breakfast at the Restaurant- it was beautifully presented and delicious, and the server kindly honored my request for no fish by substituting a spread of vegetables. One tiny quibble with an otherwise extraordinary experience: we found the service at the Aman to be somewhat less efficient than the service at comparable Tokyo hotels (such as the Park Hyatt). Breakfast service, for instance, can be somewhat slow and inconsistent, and I can see the the check-in/check-out service feeling slow if you are accustomed to the rapid-fire pace of a more business-oriented hotel (though as leisure travelers, we enjoyed the process and thought the staff were excellent). I also found the Concierge to be not quite on par with the rest of the service. Even the simple request of a surprise gift of chocolates for my partner took numerous exchanges and calls and felt more complicated than it should have (not to mention that they ruined the surprise by bringing the chocolates to the door and handing them directly to him, instead of leaving the box at turndown as we'd agreed). But if the Aman Tokyo adjusts their few service quirks, and perhaps improves their concierge staff, they will be unstoppable. In any case, they have made us into lifetime devotees. We're returning to Tokyo in a few months and we'll definitely be booking a few nights at our new ""home""- the Aman.","Long Island City, New York","ValeP36</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island City, New York</strong>",21,5.0

This year, we have decided to pamper ourselves by staying at Aman Tokyo, the first Aman that we've ever stay.With high anticipation, we arrived the hotel around 3pm, was shown to the 33rd floor lobby and served the welcome drink by a very polite receptionist. As am avid architecture fan, I must say this Kerry Hill's design is stunning and the epitome of understating luxury.Time passing by quickly while we were enjoying the lobby and we realised that it was almost 45 minutes already pass 3pm, and we were still didn't being checked in. It was quite an disappointing experience especially it is an Aman, during your birthday and also the first Aman stay. The staff sensed our unhappiness and about 10 minutes later, a lady staff came to us very apologically and brought us to our room at Level 35, the have upgraded our room to the palace viewing side. Upon entering our room, we were stunned by the view, the size and the detailing of the room, it was truly top norch. The lady also offered us coffee due to the delayed in checked in. Our unhappiness was all gone with the politeness and nice gesture of the lady.Against other reviews, we weren't offer a champagne, cake or greeting card eventhough it was booked under my wife's name, and it was her birthday. And the fact that they saw us bringing a cake with us. All the amenities in Aman Tokyo are top notch. The heated pool is stunning, the gym is so well equipped and the Japanese bath is very nice with a view of Tokyo Skytree. And the detailings of the design are impeccable, such as the heated floor at the Bath room.We had a truly enjoyable one night stay and it was the first time we swum in Tokyo! And looking forward to stay in other Aman's properties.","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","chunchongbeh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</strong>",127,4.0

We communicated with the concierge team at Aman for a month prior to our arrival, and they assisted in making reservations at three restaurants, including a three-star Michelin restaurant that was rumored to be very hard to get in to. We arrived earlier than their check-in time, so after completing check-in procedures, we went out for lunch. When we came back, a staff member escorted us to the room, explaining all facilities in detail -- we were pleased to find that our suitcases had been delivered to our room already. We came back from a day walking/eating our way around the city, to find that the Front Office staff had arranged a bottle of wine, chocolates, and a birthday greeting card for me in the room -- very nice touch, especially since I had not mentioned to them that it was my birthday (they must have noticed the date on my passport when checking in). Check out was also pleasant, as we requested late check out to 3:30 and were given it with no problem.

That said, I would have rather experienced this short stay, than not go at all.I've stayed at many Amans and the top luxury hotels around the world, but honestly nothing in recent memory has impressed me this much. I truly felt like I was in heaven! We were upgraded to a corner suite, and from the moment we walked into the room, we didn't want to leave. That is saying a lot, since Tokyo is our favorite city, and there is so much to do and see! The decor was a modern take of traditional Japanese, with blonde wood everywhere, sliding doors, and floor to ceiling windows with views of Tokyo Tower, Mt. Fuji, and the Imperial Palace... And the bathroom - Oh my god! It had heated floors, and a large room with both a shower and soaking tub overlooking the city. We watched sunset over Mt. Fuji in our room, and it was one of the most incredible moments we've had in Tokyo to date. The pool is also magical, flanked with daybeds and the same fantastic view. The service everywhere was impeccable, but I wouldn't expect any less from an Aman. The front desk staff and General Manager were incredibly attentive, especially since we were hoping to extend our stay. While we were unlucky in that we couldn't extend, I wouldn't have changed anything about our stay. I write about food and travel, and while this was a destination on my personal bucket list, I would tell anyone thinking of staying here that it's worth completely it. I've stayed at many of the top Tokyo hotels, but this is an experience above and beyond your wildest Tokyo dreams! It is the most relaxing, beautiful retreat in the middle of a busy, bustling, and fun city. I hope to return to this Aman, and because of my wonderful stay here, I'm looking to change my Bali trip to include stays at the Amans there as well.

This was our first Aman experience and we're already officially ""junkies"". Everything is of course so well designed and engineered in Tokyo. The Aman takes this perfection and infuses it into every aspect of their first urban property - the spa, pool, lobby, room design, flawless service, exquisite food... I can't say enough good things. All of the spaces are ethereal. From the moment you walk into the cavernous lobby, you truly feel like you're experiencing a realm of heaven. And I've never experienced more intention or care given to the design of a guest room. We stayed in the Premier Room and enjoyed stunning views of the Tokyo skyline. Every member of the staff that we interacted with (before, during and after our stay) was so incredibly kind and helpful. Everyone genuinely wanted to see you happy and was interested in you. As if they saw your request or question, not as a task, but as a chance to learn from a friend or engage on a human level. As mentioned, the food was absolutely delicious. In a city like Tokyo with more michelin starred options than nearly anywhere else, choosing where to eat can be tricky. Every meal we had in Tokyo was sublime, and that includes the two meals (one breakfast in the restuarant and one room-service dinner) that we had at the Aman. If you're not won over by the Aman Tokyo website, I don't know what else could convince you. Almost once a month my partner or I will stop what we're doing and just say, ""I wish we were back at the Aman Tokyo."" That is usually followed by 10-15 minutes of reliving every beautiful detail that we can remember. Until next time, we have the exquisite memories to hold us over.","Chicago, Illinois","matthiaspierce</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",61,5.0

I didn't fully get why this was more expensive than those hotels except for newness.The gym was nice and open for 24 hours was a traveler friendly, which most of hotels in Tokyo won't offer this kind of service. Bath at the fitness center was outstanding to see the skyline. Swimming pool was beautiful. In room, it was calm and zen mood- very quiet, which was awesome. Additionally, slippers were very comfy, but amenity was too simple. TV set was awesome to rise when needed and hide when not in use in order not to interrupt the wonderful view. The bath salt was soothing... Yet, still I don't find a significant reason of this price difference. Good service but not as thorough as some of other hotels. The worst thing was in room dining. It was horrible. My order, chicken and egg Oyako -don was easy to cook and simple soul food - delicious and soothing; this was my very first time to be served such a yucky, hard chicken in rubber like omelette on top of rice (rice was delicious). I highly recommend that the hotel manager should review what chef cooks. This thumbs down dinner didn't meet a 5 star hotel ranking or luxury hotel name. Honestly, I had never eaten such a disgusting oyako-don throughout Japan - very shocking to be served this level of food at this hotel.Aside from that, the restaurant at the lobby was decent.

While the experience is different than other Aman experiences, it is, nonetheless, every bit as ideal. The staff, particularly the concierge, is flawless. (They delivered on EVERYTHING!!) We will never forget the kindness shown by Aman's longtime driver. We requested to be taken by the the home of our friends who used to live in Tokyo (but left immediately after the earthquake that occurred several years ago) for a quick picture. The hotel was gracious enough to accommodate our request, but, more impressive and so appreciated, was that the driver used the return trip to the hotel to give us a quick tour of some of Tokyo's highlights. My daughter and I got more out of that 30 minute unexpected tour (and had more fun and made a ton of fantastic memories...we are still dreaming of those donuts and rice crackers) than I can ever say. We even have the best pictures in front of Tomyo Tower!! We had a guide for 4 days and it was the Aman driver (and the concierge and the most friendly and gracious bellmen ANYWHERE) who really made the strongest impression on our beautiful and special time in Tokyo. We are a family of three and stayed in a suite and had another room. Obviously, the space was more than adequate. For us, we like having a table to eat breakfast, a desk to for my daughter to continue her homework or play and a living room to relax while trying to recover from that long flight. The views of the city are terrific and while I didn't love being up at the crack of dawn because of jet lag, I sure adored watching the sunrises. As usual, Aman knows how to get the rooms super dark, which is paramount to our sleeping. The rooms were also very, very quiet. We loved the location. While it is located in the financial district, we appreciated the quietness yet the very close proximity to everything. My daughter walked with me to Starbucks or shopping every day. (Although once the person in room service found out I was sneaking off to Starbucks, they made it their mission to deliver the perfect latte each morning and they certainly did!!). We also found all the restaurants we wanted to go just a short cab ride away. I would be remiss if I didn't give a shout out to the unsung, highly trained stealth Aman housekeepers who provide unparalleled service compared to any other 5 or 6 star hotels. Aman Tokyo met the already high bar.It do not recall meeting the manager during our stay, which seems common practice when staying with Aman, but the staff we did meet made us feel very welcome, were extremely helpful and made our stay flow seamlessly.

What I've found with the Peninsula in the last couple of years is that service seem to have dropped a bit.Note: The location of the Aman is not as good as the Peninsula, but it made us venture out of our comfort zone a bit.

The pool is nicely heated up despite the cold and chilling winter climate outdoor. The Onsen by the swimming pool has a huge bath with equally great view. I suppose this is the luxury about Aman Tokyo; i.e. an urban resort located at 33/F of Otemachi Tower right at the heart of Tokyo business district. The hotel is connected to Exit B2 of the Otemachi subway Station; exclusive yet convenient.I booked a deluxe junior suite, which is the standard-size room, with great view over the Palace and Mt Fuji. Room is huge by Tokyo standard, even bigger than that of the Peninsular at Ginza. The bathroom is provided with heated floor, which is great for the cold winter, with a purpose-built onsen tub with equally great view. The living area is great with a huge day-bed by the window. The design of the room is sleek and very zen.Hardware is perfect; no complaints at all. The service is not up to the other Aman resorts offered in the other parts of the world. Service at the pool is great but that at the restaurant could have been improved.Breakfast selection is limited, they only offer American, continental and Japanese breakfast at Yen42,000 ++. The had dinner at the restaurant once; food quality is average but the service at the restaurant for both the breakfast and dinner could have been more attentive, bearing in mind the rate of the standard room is 3 times that of the Peninsular, i.e. almost US$1,500 per night. I would have expected more attentive services at the restaurant. The next question is: would I recommend Aman Tokyo to anyone. Yes and no. If you have time to spend enjoying a relaxing afternoon or evening at the heated pool and onsen; I would highly recommend Aman Tokyo, as there isn't any hotel in Tokyo which offers similar facilities; i.e an oasis in the heart of busy Tokyo. But if one is going to Tokyo to sight -see or shopping and doesn't have the time to relax and enjoy the facilities, the rates at US$15,000 per night is not value for the money.",Hong Kong,"HKG_Traveller2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",69,4.0

The design was interesting and the views, including Mt.Fuji were superb6) the spa is good but again not outstanding , the library , which is usually a place of reflection at Aman properties , is next to the lobby with the disco music7) as a business hotel ( which seemed to be the case for many) it is too expensive , as a destination hotel - perhaps a unique visit for the local clientele , but as an Aman ( the word means peaceful) it misses the mark.I conclude that Aman Tokyo is trying to be all things to all people and not completely satisfying any of them.

Housekeeping very responsive as well as room service. However do not expect the same welcome and recognition that is present in all the other Amanresorts we have stayed in. You are not personally greeted by the resident manager or GM but do receive the usual greeting drink. No one remembers your name, other then one door man. Apart from the library which is limited for guest use, the public areas are crowded with non resident visitors. The ambience is more like the public areas at the Oriental in Bangkok or MO in Tokyo. There is no complimentary afternoon tea or drinks with a cultural performance. Concierge is not as savvy as say at MO, Capital Hotel Tokyu or FS.

It is located in a block in a rather exclusive area of Tokyo and it occupies only the top 2 or 3 floors. The ground level though is efficiently manned by the Aman staff which means checking in is no problem. Unlike most of the other Aman's world wide, this is one Aman that lacks the gorgeous or interesting surroundings that usually signify the Aman identity. BUT all is not lost. In the main area of the building Aman has this magnificent view of Tokyo - a wonderful panorama of Tokyo covering a wide area from the Tokyo tower to the gardens of the Palace. As can be expected, this is a popular area and we suspect that non-hotel guests were amongst those who sat there for many hours day and night to enjoy the view. The Aman serves a high tea (Japanese style - which is less 'rich' than regular high tea's anywhere else) for guests which means there is a good reason to be there.We arrived rather early but to our delight, we were given our room immediately - because it was available! none of that pretending most hotels do to discourage early check-ins. And the room was a delight - frankly - so clean and so 'big' unlike most Japanese hotels. Cleaning services were excellent - efficient and 'quiet'. And our room had this magnificent view of Tokyo as well.My only complaint was the mattress. Strangely, i found it very lumpy. In the centre it was so soft and uneven i had trouble sleeping well. But because i loved the place so much i only commented on it when we left. I think i did that because knowing the reactions of the Japanese, they would be distraught that i had a problem and would have fussed over it. My fault!! Just a comment over the swimming pool- lovely long pool but because of the sombre grey tones in the tiles etc, it was not very inviting. It would be good though for serious swimmers doing laps.

It's not everyday that you are given the opportunity to receive such high-level therapeutic body work!Unfortunately on the last night of my stay I had a very negative and so ""un-Aman"" experience in The Restaurant by Aman where I had dinner. The service and the food was not up to the Aman Standards I am accustomed to. When I tried to find solutions to the issues with the Restaurant Manager, it just made things worse. She expressed clear irritation in having to deal with me and I felt totally under-valued as a Guest. The energy was so tense that I decided to leave and order from in-room dining in my room. A very sad end to an unforgettable stay.The next day I addressed a long letter to the F & B Manager expressing my disappointment and regrets from my experience the night before. It has now been over 6 weeks and I have not received a response even though the Front Office staff confirmed that it was received and that my letter was being examined by top management in the hotel.

The design of the hotel is absolutely magnificent while remaining Japanese minimalist. It's extremely Kerry Hill. Rooms are spacious with the best view in Tokyo. Actually the lowest category rooms are pretty much twice the size of the rooms in other luxury hotels in Tokyo. I received an upgrade to a suite. I came to Tokyo by myself that time and it was too lavish for a solo traveler..... Although opened last year, some parts of the room is already wearing down such as the leather on the shelves.Concierge was disappointing and does need improvement. Aman is used to resorts and probably not a city hotel especially for a city like Tokyo with its own rules. I booked the hotel about a month in advance and communicated with the concierge regarding restaurant arrangements. For each email I had to wait a day to get a response.It is common knowledge that restaurant slots fill in a sec in Tokyo and I do expect faster responses. Below is the story:There was a guest stayed at Aman before and booked a restaurant via Aman. However, he didn't show up or something. Eventually Aman was held responsible for the incident and the restaurant owner/chef was punishing Aman by banning it from booking the restaurant again. It turned out that I couldn't book the restaurant and didn't give me explanation but simply""Aman Tokyo's reservation inquiry is not accepted with them"" which was more than official. However, my later emails received feedback that they could book the restaurant I originally wanted, which caused a huge confusion. After I emailed them asking the the reason angrily, Aman was honest with me. I understand that Aman wanted to save its face instead of letting its customers feel it is incapable. However, confusions and conflicts come from the lack of transparency. The perfect concierge in Tokyo is definitely Ritz Carlton. When I stayed at Ritz Carlton, the concierge actually booked the restaurant before returning my email to secure the space. For every email I sent, I received a response in hours instead of days. Aman Tokyo should really work on their concierge service to satisfy global foodie amanjunkies' needs in Tokyo. Check in time is 3PM. The hotel doesn't allow early check in at all, which is not very Aman. Japanese tradition is strictly follow the rules however I do believe there are no rules for Aman? Cookies are delicious as always. Overall Aman Tokyo is definitely best of the best in Tokyo. However it is not surprisingly good as you receive good service everywhere in Tokyo.

I am not sending this review for any potential irrationality but more to help management realize more can be done to make this hotel become ranked as one of the best in the world .Part of a city hotel experience (which aman is now vying to enter into as opposed to their usual far off resort locale ) is to ensure that that management and staff need to understand the nuances of dealing with a faster pace city location and the it's customers who may have different priorities and requirements and time constraints. What is extremely important is that concierge staff should really know the ins and outs of their city ( even at different times - concierge duties end at 8pm ??) I struggled to find a venue on a few occasions and some of the venue suggested I would not really recommend - tokyo has a lot to offer and it changes . When the morning staff are there they are extremely polite and kind but you need staff with confidence and can give you direction and quick honest opinions and recommendations . furthermore if you change ( not skip) a restaurant venue you may be subject to a 100usd cancellation per person if you change or cancel which the hotel would keep ( there is always a first I guess ) the rationale and reason is things are done differently in Tokyo but at 2000 usd a night for a room you would expect staff to make a difference or be more accomadative ) . If you call the restaurant directly they would never ask you for a credit card and you can cancel in advance accordingly. The Aman concierge team need to develop much better working relationships and understanding of global traveler demands. Things do change and a hotel has to work towards working with the guest on the change (the first comment I got when I arrived jet lagged and requested to change my lunch reservation to an evening time is we may have to charge you ! - how transactional and it really took me off guardOn a very minor note , one needs to also be extremely cognizant of the service fee and taxes that aman charges above and beyond the rack rate if you book directly with them - again something I have not been really used to on my many travels and travails across the globe including other aman assets . The reference ""may be subjected "" means you will be 100 percent subjected , I am not one to fuss but it is close is 22 percent above and beyond the usual rack rate charges ( tax is only 8 percent) why don't you just include everything in one rate ? At least one would not really need to read the fine print ...

The other 2 Aman experiences we had were a bit underwhelming.We love the design of Aman Tokyo, which is traditional Japanese yet very chic. The lobby is stunning. We had the Premier Twin Room and the layout was like a Japanese house. There was even a genkan which is a Japanese style foyer. The bed was facing the floor to ceiling windows and the skyline of Tokyo with the view of Skytree was amazing day and night.They have excellent therapists at the Spa. We booked a second treatment right after we had our first. The pool looks very inviting but we did not have time to use. We had dinner one night at the Restaurant. Food was fusion of Japanese and Italian and everything was delicious. Service was outstanding. We tried the famous Black Afternoon Tea at the lounge. Their afternoon tea is so popular, they serve it from 11:30am to 9:30pm. However, if you are not staying at the hotel, do not expect to get a table without reservation.When we stayed at the other 2 Aman hotels, there was no need to sign for anything. At Aman Tokyo, we were asked to sign the bill at the lounge but not at the restaurant, the Spa or for the room service. We dined at the lounge twice and both times we made reservation with our room number, so they knew we were in house guests.

And YES, I was right...For their first urban property (not so first if we count the ex-Aman in New Delhi and Aman Summer Palace), Aman has opened THE hotel, every urban travelers are dreaming about. Perched at the top of the Otemachi Tower in the elegant district of Marunouchi, not far from the top end shopping area of Ginza, this is the most stunning city hotel I've seen in my entire life.Everything starts with the entrance, discreet (as always with Aman), and so beautifully designed. Staff greets you with a generous smile and this sense of service Japanese have the secret for before escorting you in what is truly the most impressive hotel lobby ever, a piece of art in itself, like a Zen garden and the soaring lobby rises 30 meters like the sky over this breathtaking architecture. Delightful traditional japanese music played by a traditionally dressed woman and straight in front of view, extensive windows overlooking the skyscrapers of Tokyo and the Fuji-san background... It is probably the most amazing view I've seen from an hotel and it gives you the feeling like floating over Tokyo.But even if this view took all your attention, you can't forget how wonderfully, the Aman japanese family welcomes you. With style, extreme kindness, unparalleled elegance, you will be escorted to your ""home"" because we can't talk about rooms or suites at Aman Tokyo but this kind of space where you will feel immediately at home.If possible, pick a Suite for having truly the impression to live in Tokyo. It's huge but intimate, designed in a modern Japanese style extending the comfort to the highest level you can expect. Views from Corner suites are so gorgeous and it's almost impossible to stop at looking the beauty of Tokyo. Beds are heavenly just like the bathroom looking like your own Onsen. All the materials used for the design are just exceptional (superb clear wood for the bedroom, solid black stone for the bathroom, wash paper to divide the areas...) and create a true well being sanctuary from where it will be hard to leave.But Aman has even more to offer... A fantastic spa providing probably the best treatments of Japan (at a cost for sure...); an incredible pool overlooking Tokyo simply breathtaking; lounges, library where to relax is one of these precious moments in a life; probably the most delicious afternoon tea ever with both savory and sweet delicacies so yummy and a couple of restaurants but not offering Japanese cuisine which is probably the only downside I've been able to notice. Both restaurants are beautifully designed, both with a great atmosphere but it is quite surprising there is not a place where to enjoy a traditional Kaiseki dinner because Aman tries usually to be in complete harmony with the country and not having a Japanese restaurant surprised me.However, how not to feel very special when staying at Aman Tokyo with such an interior design, with such a family looking at the smallest detail which can make happy the guests, with so many faces having a permanent smile...

In my opinion, nothing else in Tokyo compares. Superb, warm and welcoming service, breathtaking architecture and incredibly beautiful rooms. It was like being at the world's most elegant ryokan, it was a wonderful oasis to which to return at the end of a busy day in a busy city.

The predominant colors are gray slate and light woods, in sleek, ultra contemporary designs that display dramatic whimsy with extraordinarily effective restraint. It's a novel salute to Japanese aesthetics by people with erudite tastes who are not Japanese, so it feels creative, despite the often dead-end sukiyazukuri minimalism inherent in much Japanese design. There appears little is visible that is not functional, but it nonetheless strikes one as utterly gorgeous, due to its restrained design and unabashedly lavish usage of what may be Japan's most valuable commodity: space. The guest room was elegantly uncluttered in appearance but richly appointed; the bath simple yet heavenly. The sinfully spacious, visually engaging corridors impress, as does the lobby. But it's the views from walls of windows that save the interiors from being merely svelte and contemporary. It's Japan From Foreign Eyes, not at all authentic, but fresh. The floral arrangements in the room were simply bits of bushes plopped into a frogless container inside a handsome fake basket. Not ikebana but who cares? They made you reexamine little sprigs of nature. Aman Tokyo has a few big failures, the first being the food in a city famous for go-for-broke eating out. The staff uniforms are humorous redeployments of local traditional clothing. And many of the staff, many of whom were not Japanese but in menial jobs, seem untrained so service is uneven, and therefore sometimes shockingly uncharacteristic of Japanese standards. But with such a quietly opulent interior and those endless views of glittering Tokyo, and a pool made on high, the flaws seem minimal and forgivable. But bring money and be prepared not to whimper when you get your bills. Business executives will not stay here, and it probably isn't a good location for first hand encounters with Japanese life, but if you can afford it once or twice, it's a very beautiful, interesting spot to stay.

Only thing that I would like them to take note is probably the quality of room service. The food was alright but not great. I would expect something very delicious if staying in such a nice hotel.

Once we arrived at the 33rd floor and walk into the lobby, we were overwhelmed by the beauty and design! It's a 5 story atrium, with the upper levels made up of rice paper. The design of our room was pretty amazing, and considering the small spaces you always hear Tokyo is famous for, it was pretty massive, with the main bedroom, the large bathroom, and an entire adjoining living room/second half bathroom. Throughout, the design was a modern / contemporary mixed in with the traditional, and the quality was just wonderful.The service and attentiveness of the staff throughout our entire stay was phenomenal, the amenities were wonderful, the pool is one of the most beautiful I've seen, and the spa was great.

There was the public bath (onsen) available at the Spa for guest to use and the large pool which was most of the time unused. Love that the water was warm in winter unlike other 5 star hotels I've stayed at in Tokyo.Limousine bus from Narita airport would alight you straight at the hotel which is a plus(we had a lot of baggages) a taxi wouldn't even be enough to accommodate all our luggage.What made my trip most memorable at Aman is the breathtaking views from almost every corner of the hotel. Right from the lobby, to the Spa, the pool, the bathroom and my own deluxe room. It is probably one of the most quiet hotel in the city I've stayed at which is a plus.

It is nicely decorated as a resort room. Unfortunately the room is not kid or elderly friendly. The are corners on many furnitures and it is easy to hit one's head on something. There are three steps in the middle if the room, which I think is designed to separate the sleeping area and living area.The area is very quiet at night as it is in the business district.

The woman from Hong Kong who claims ""no-one"" in the restaurant understands English - I didn't have that problem with a single staff member, and I am - as it happens - English. They all spoke English perfectly fine. And yes, they understood the word ""milk"". Duh. The guy from Kuwait who says the Japanese are ""just the way they are"" with service - no, guy from Kuwait, Japan has the best service on the planet and no, they don't need training from Americans, who these days have some of the worst. You just have to adapt a little bit, maybe, but not very much. The location you can *research* before you arrive, so if the ten minute walk to the ""shopping streets"" ( whatever that means in Tokyo ) is too much, you can factor that in. Most Tokyo shopping is spread out over an area larger than the Emirates, so it's a meaningless complaint anyway. Otemachi is in the north end of Ginza, smack in the middle of the world's largest metropolis. So no, you don't get to go walkies everywhere because it's a city of 35 million people. Got that? As for the hotel, it's pretty much faultless unless you're a walking zombie. True, you get to eat much cheaper at thousands of other places in the gastronomic capital of the world, but then you don't get to look at Mount Fuji fading into the dusk and flop into your room directly afterwards. It's this thing called *hotel prices* which you already know about. If you are fazed by hotel prices, then you eat outside the hotel : voila! How simple it is! As for rooms not being ready at 9am, well, if they're full they're full - are they going to turf people out into the street because you have an early flight? Yes, frustrating, but there you are. It's the same everywhere unless the hotel has an empty room. Boom. As for the Aman : fantastic rooms with private stone onsets, gorgeous public onsen ( largely empty because the foreigners don't know what an onsen is ), soaring lobby made of traditional paper, amazing city views ( and the aforementioned Fuji ) and impeccable service.

Every detail is designed carefully, and the rooms are very spacious according to Tokyo Standards. The room and the bathroom are extremely modern. The floors are heated, and the toilet seat is state of art. The window drapes would make the room absolutely dark. The view from the high floor room is exceptional. It is not a child friendly room though, as all of the furniture edges are little sharp.The restaurant and room service food are excellent, but overpriced. It is a pity that the room rate does not include breakfast too.The hotel staff are working to their potentials, and trying their best to assist us. The problem with Japanese people is that they are not very well accustomed with any other culture. Also most of them don't speak any language besides Japanese. They are very friendly, and they try to help you anywhere, anytime, and anyhow. The hotel staff seems to have memorized the manual very well, but they can't interact accordingly. If I ever want to change something from the menu, they would panic and would not do it correctly. I can't complain, because I know that this is their potential, and that this is the way they are! I recommend to get an outside training company (preferably American) and train all of the staff in a very intensified training course. It would really make a big difference. I like the idea of making a separate hotel entrance with specialized staff at the Ground level of the Otemachi Building. I also liked the direct non-stop elevator to the Hotel lobby on the 33rd floor.I didn't like the way the front desk is designed. It is right in front of the elevator, and looks like an office reception. I recommend moving it to another location away from the elevator, and redesigning it to more hotel-like reception check in area. Also the concierge is located in a very far secluded corner, and I suggest keeping both Reception and concierge close to each other.I had an incident with the hotel that I didn't like. My long 8 hours overnight flight arrived at Narita airport early in the morning. I have sent several emails to the hotel prior to my arrival stating that I would like my room to be ready by 9 a.m. The hotel informed me that they are at full capacity, and they will try their best to accommodate my room. When I arrived with my family, they said that the room won't be ready until 12 p.m. I was frustrated provided that I have given them a notice. The manager gave me the model room. It was a quick solution, but I was expecting a better service for staying at a very pricey high end hotel! They would not have done anything if I have not been upset. My point is that these basic mistakes should not happen in a resort like The Aman Chain.I believe by now you see the need for my training recommendation.The hotel location is a bit secluded, and far from the main shopping areas. Some people may want that seclusion, but as for my family, it is a far walk. The taxis are available everywhere though, and the Otemachi tower has its own restaurants and shops too.Overall, Aman is very overpriced for the service level they have.

Others have rightly described the soaring lobby, the huge (for Tokyo) rooms with their Japanese screens and Japanese soaking tubs with views high above Tokyo. But it was the staff who confirmed to us that Aman can bring their magic to city tower blocks, as for example they accompanied us downstairs to ensure we chose gifts appropriate for the Japanese friends we were dining with that night. We had to leave early next morning for our flight, but not until we had enjoyed through room service - at 5:30 am - the best breakfast (think continental meets kaiseki) I have ever tasted.

During my travels for both pleasure and business i stayed in the best hotels and ryokans around the country and truly nothing comes close to the Aman in Tokyo: it is like an urban oasis in the middle of a bustling city, a combination of the best ryokan with the all the amenities of a contemporary hotel. When you enter into the lobby you are in awe of the height and the sense of space which is so rare in Japan. You are basically in a cocoon up in the sky and the rooms are all in the 4 floors above the lobby. The views are sensational, the ever changing ikebana center piece of the lobby mesmerizing, the attention to detail typical Aman. We stayed in a suite which was more like an apartment, with a seperate living room, kitchenette, office and toilette and it was the perfect room to be able to entertain and have a private dinner with friends / business associates. The actual bedroom (which i understand is the standard room) is so spacious and so comfortable with ample living and closet space, and a lovely bathroom which included a shower and a traditional Japanese ofuro. The Spa and the gym are sublime and the swimming pool up in the sky is like no other (albeit the water is a bit too warm if you want to swim laps). Loved the Japanese traditional baths in the changing rooms as well as all the little amenities. My only complaint was that there was no in house shiatsu therapist and during the 4 days i was there it was not possible to schedule a shiatsu with the visiting therapist. Overall it was an unfortgettable experience and if i have to find a flaw, that would the slow service in the dinning areas (during all times).Hospitality in Tokyo is now on a completely different level, and i dare say, that although the hotel is pricy, it is really worth the price you pay. Wether for business or pleasure, the Aman Tokyo is by far the best place to stay in town.

Among them, Aman Tokyo definitely definitely offers one of the best, if not the best experience for those who want to stay with a style. In the first place, the building is amazing. You might have a little difficulties identifying its entrance at the ground level. But once you go to the lobby at 33rd floor, you find gorgeous lobby with breathtaking views. Rooms are designed with a good integration of Japanese and western style. I must say that it is improvised style with more emphasis on comtemporary which offers maximum funcionality and not at all the same as Ryokan, which offers more traditional Japanese atmosphere. But if you are not Japanese, you would find this a good balance. Staffs are very friendly and well trained. They care each guest very much and quite attentive. Sports gym is nice. But you really need to check indoor pool, sauna and large bath. Those facilities are by itself offers the reason to stay this hotel. Breakfast is very nice. It is flavorful and very healthy.

Immaculate service and attention to detail. Great laundry service. The hostess in her traditional dress spoke perfect English and was most helpful as was the concierge. A wonderful guide was arranged for us who took us on 2 half day tours of Tokyo by train taxi and walking. an experience well worth while as you glean a lot of information and stop at out of the way coffee houses and see some great architectural pieces. The hotel sits above a train station which makes it all easy. We also walked to the Ginza and the Imperial gardens are nearby. There is a beautiful spa and I thoroughly enjoyed my massage but it was not cheap. I would not agree with another reviewer as to service. We got the usual friendly and efficient Aman 6 star service.As a result of this being the newest hotel in Tokyo it is very popular with groups of local women coming for high tea and when we had friends for drinks before dinner at 6pm it was hard to get a table near the bar as the customers did not want to move.As this is a city hotel we paid for all meals but did enjoy 2 dinners in the restaurant. good waiters and a knowledgable sommelier.

Having stayed at other Aman locations in Asia and Europe, we had high expectation of the premise. The interior/decor is impeccable, subtle but a low key luxurious modern Japanese style. However, we all found the services are abit rusty, considering the cost and usual Aman standard. Upon arrival (arrived at 2.40pm) they insisted on sitting us at the lobby until 3pm as it is the official check in time. At 3.10pm the room is ready, I was being guided to my room, however it was only until 20mins my luggages arrived. For my usual 5-stars hotel experiences, the luggages are often in room already prior entering, not to mention we had to wait for 30mins at the lobby for the room to be ready. The rest of stay we have received regular greeting letter and welcoming snacks in room from the hotel. But they seemed to be given out of formality. One morning we approached the concierge desk to ask if we would need a reservation for breakfast for a group of 6 as some local friends will be joining us in the morning after. She said yes, however instead of helping us making the reservation on the spot, she had made us to walk all the way to the breakfast restaurant to make the booking ourselves where it could be just one phone call away for her)During one meal spent in the hotel, we kindly asked the hotel to prepare a slice of a cake as our friend happened to be spending her birthday in Tokyo. We were refused at first, claiming that they do not have any cake they can offer. We went back and asked about the cake options on the in room dining menu, we also expressed that we are happy to cover all costs, and at last we got our cake.If all the above happened in a 4 star or a generic 5 star hotel, we probably wouldn't feel as disappointed. Also, in Japan where they usually have the most superb retail and hospitality services, and not to mention having paid more than 1000usd one night, we expect the usual ""Aman standard"" where they would take an extra effort to make sure a pleasant stay for their guests.Comparing other options, I would probably recommend Peninsula or Grand Hyatt for a comfortable stay in Tokyo.","Taipei, Taiwan","pamplemousssy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",25,3.0

At Aman, you don't sign bills in the restaurants as the hosts are expected to know your name and anticipate your needs.

Despite being in a business area, we found the hotel conveniently located for tourists. Our suite was on the corner of the building with beautiful views out over Akihabara to the north and the Imperial Gardens/Shinjuku to the West--the highlight was watching the sun rise and Mt. Fuji come into view behind the buildings. As always, Aman's decor (minimalist south Asian style) was elegant, though the Tokyo hotel was more ""Ikea-ish"" than other Aman's at which we've stayed.The food was generally good (breakfast every day plus one late night dinner in the restaurant), but nothing was particularly memorable and service was generally impersonal in the restaurant. The highlight there, however, was Japanese whiskey at the lobby bar. Their bartenders were expert, engaging, and interesting people, and we spent ~90 min learning about the whiskeys and talking to the bartenders.In terms of service, there was one big, humongous, unable-to-ignore miss: the hotel knew we had a 9-month old well in advance (60-days-plus; I'd spoken with the concierge) of our visit, but failed to reserve a crib, and one was not available for our stay. One staff member apologized, but did nothing to 'recover' from the mistake.

This hotel in the Chiyoda district opened in December 2014 in a tower block that overlooks the Imperial Palace; the moat of the palace is a five minute walk from the hotel. The immediate area around the hotel is populated mainly by offices, though the hotel has a smart cafe at the ground floor next to the entrance, and the building is not far from the Ginza (about a mile). Just to the side of the hotel, down an escalator, is a mini shopping mall. This has a few restaurants and cafes, a convenience store, pharmacist and a florist, which may come in useful during your stay. It also has access to the Otemachi metro station. If you are coming from the airport then the hotel is a very short taxi ride, or indeed a walk, from Tokyo station. The ground floor reception has a bank of lifts that whisk you to the 33rd floor to a vast, airy lobby with a massive picture window looking out over the city; on a clear day you can see Mount Fuji in the distance.The rooms are huge by Tokyo standards, without clutter (the TV is tucked discreetly away in a wooden cabinet at the foot of the bed and emerges from its home on request via a bank of high tech controls at the bedside. There are chairs, table and chaise longue by the picture window, and a tastefully lit single plant pot on display to one side. The bathroom is generously sized, with excellent shower and a computerised toilet of the kind that the Japanese love; this one lifts its lid as you approach, and flushes automatically. It could probably beat you at Scrabble if it put its mind to it. The Internet in the room is ultra fast, with download speed of 85 MBps and upload speed only a touch less, which to put into context is over six times faster than current European average broadband speed. One feature that I like but so rarely encounter is the provision of ample electrical sockets at easily reachable height, a bank of them via a discrete wooden panel at the head of the bed. There are large closets with sliding shoji doors. This is one of the best designed hotel rooms that I have stayed in anywhere. My only caveat is that, for those with delicate backs, the mattress is at the firm end of the softness spectrum. The hotel has a spectacular swimming pool and well equipped spa/fitness facility accessible from the the 34th floor, with the restaurant at the lobby level looking out over the panoramic view over the city. Staff are attentive, helpful and plentiful. There are lots of little touches that elude most luxury hotels. If you plug some electrical device in then when you next check back into your room you will find the cable neatly tied. The laundry is returned in a box so elegantly wrapped that it looks like a birthday gift. The concierge staff are helpful and diligent, and the staff on the door greeted me by name from the second day onwards, The Aman is a spectacular modern hotel and a well located haven to stay in this vibrant city.

That is what you buy into. Tricky here, because this is a big city hotel. To replicate that fine Aman experience outside of the Aman resort scenario is not easy. Aman Tokyo succeeds - mostly. It is an absolutely breathtaking hotel. The Lobby is utterly gorgeous. The restaurant beautiful (more about that later), and the Spa a knockout (more later).Check in was swift and exemplary. My suite, a Deluxe King, was very spacious and beautifully appointed, in a classic, Japanese style. Incredibly comfortable bed and an amazing bathroom with heated stone floors and a gorgeous stone tub at the window for traditional Japanese bathing. It was a daily ritual for me and unbelievably relaxing. The Spa with it's pre-treatment bathing areas and steam room was wonderful. The body scrub, massage and facial I had were all top-notch. The heated indoor pool is the best and most dramatic in Tokyo.Service in the hotel was excellent throughout my stay. It was a little disconcerting at times though to be asked my room number on so many occasions. This is where the Aman touch was put to the test. Being a larger property for them I have no doubt it's not easy to remember every guest by name, but it is what is expected of an Aman property.I had great conversations with the GM and F&B Manager whose level of expertise and service really shone through. Here is where I felt the true Aman hospitality.The food in the restaurant was excellent. I had a delicious dinner - a very innovative and well constructed menu. Breakfast was fantastic - you could tell the quality of the ingredients. Really very good.I was a little disappointed not to receive a room upgrade, both through my Amex FHR benefits and also considering I have stayed at so many Aman properties. This was the first time I have not been upgraded at an Aman. It doesn't sit that well with me. I know the next category room was available as I checked. Duly noted for future reservations.Check out was a little cold - another area where it was let down. Checking and paying the bill in a crowded lobby while a junior member of staff hovered over me was a little unpleasant. No wave off here by the senior staff or personal goodbye from the GM. This also differentiated this property from Amanresorts.Small quips though - I loved my stay here. It is still young and I have no doubt there will be further improvement. It just didn't have that ""over and above"" Aman sheen. The little extra touches were missing. It's probably close to the very best hotel in Tokyo right now. I would think it will definitely be at the top of that tree soon.","Sydney, Australia","bluebotty</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",150,5.0

This is the 6th property of theirs that we have stayed at. Aman properties are synonymous with personalized service, a sense of exclusivity, exceeding expectations and a customized experience. The reason we chose Aman over other 5 star hotels is because we were looking not just for a luxurious experience but for the AMAN experience. It has been the standard that at all the other Amans we have been to, we were greeted and constantly addressed by our name. Staff went over and beyond to make sure we felt special (arranging popcorn on the beach, upgrades to beach villas, champagne on arrival). Like Ninjas, you don’t feel that they are there but they show up, anticipating your needs even before you open your mouth. They are eager to make sure your needs are attended to and are having a wonderful stay. We also look forward to the small exclusive touches like bag tags with our names on them, token Aman gifts (that represent that specific country –examples : a painted frog in Amandari, a capiz looking turtle in Amanpulo etc) on the bed right after turn down service and doing all possible instead if saying “no” or “we can’t.” When we got to this hotel we were welcomed like any other five star hotel (but not the AMAN way). This was a special occasion so we were hoping for an upgrade (our reservation said complimentary upgrade when available) but of course no upgrade. The letter of welcome in the room said “Dear guest”. In all the other AMANs they usually have our names on the welcome letter. When we had drinks at the bar with a friend in the evening, we experienced neglected service. We were sitting on the couch away from the bar and it was pretty much empty and it was so difficult to flag a waiter down to order and reorder drinks. When a waiter did take our order not only was he not friendly at all but it seemed as if we bothered him. Once a guest feels like they are bothering a waitstaff – that is not good. For breakfast we advised the waitstaff that we were rushing to bring out the food all together as soon as possible – sadly the kitchen lost our order so we missed the main breakfast. However, there were several AMAN worthy staff that made us realise that the hotel has AMAN potential. Kumiko the concierge was very warm, personable, always called us by our names and truly took care of our requests and reservations. Flordian who did the simple kind act of insisting and bringing my coffee for me from the dining room to the library and refuse to allow me to carry it myself (very kind and impressive). It was raining pretty strong so we had to walk underground to get to our dinner destination and Daichi went beyond the call of duty to help us find our way as it was pretty complicated. He did not leave us (even if we kept on telling him we were fine – super service) until he was confident that we would not get lost. When I was paying the bill, Yusuke (I hope this is the correct spelling of his name and I am guessing he is a senior manager) came over and apologised for the delay in the breakfast we had earlier in the morning (we did not end up eating the main dish because it took too long and we were in a rush). He said that there was no excuse for that and so he offered to comp our evening drinks. He gave me an Aman umbrella as a souvenir (which I originally wanted to purchase). We were on our way out and he had the hotel car take my husband and I to the train station because he could see we were rushing and pressed for time. Those gestures saved the experience for us. All the staff who took care of us from him onward started to call us by our names and finally we felt the Aman touch during the last few hours of our stay.We loved the location as it was centrally located and had 3 major subway lines right under the building. It is walking distance to Tokyo Station so very convenient if you are coming in on the Narita Express train. The room was spacious, modern and had a wonderful huge sofa by the window which is the part we liked most. We would have preferred the city view as the palace view had so many construction cranes breaking the view. We also appreciated the heated floors in the bathroom as well as the Ofuro tub. The room colors reminded us of Amankora. The breakfast at the restaurant was actually very good. The ingredients they used were fresh and well chosen. The fresh juices and pastries were also noteworthy. If only they can speed up the service as it takes too long in between courses. The hotel has only been open a couple of months so I am hoping that even if they are a city Aman they can still go back to being the Aman that we know in a non city setting. Go back to the heart of Aman – know your guests and make them feel at home. I know they can get there if they just go back to the true spirit of what makes an Aman property what it is.","Manila, Philippines","DharmaHMC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",91,4.0

It was famed as urban resort and it is.We reserved on its official website and the process was smooth. Few days before our arrival, we received email confirming the reservation and offered concierge service and transport advice. We started our vacation….Arrival was a bit of problem. We took Narita Express to Tokyo station and got on a taxi. The driver has not heard of Aman Hotel, not even the exact address that we provided. Google map and calling to the hotel could not help also. We went around the Otemachi area for 10 minutes without reaching the hotel lobby.The frustration was totally wiped away when we reached the hotel lobby on 33/F. It was just gorgeous. We have stayed in many upscale hotels in Tokyo but this one was just WOW. The lobby was spacious and zen, in Japanese style. Check-in process was a breeze and we were shown to our room and the bell staff was waiting for us with our luggage in front of our room. The front desk staff explained switches and services patiently.The suite was spacious, beautifully decorated and well appointed. It was about the biggest room we had stayed in Tokyo. Much of the nice things about the room was said by other contributors and I am not going to repeat.There is one restaurant on lobby level serving breakfast, lunch and dinner. We decided to try dinner there. When we arrived, we had to wait for a while. It was because a table by the window became available just before we arrived and the staff thoughtfully moved us to the window table. Overall food quality was good. They used fresh ingredients from around the country. The chef took effort to create delicious dishes. Service staff was well mannered but they were not experienced. I am sure given more training, it would be a good restaurant.We had breakfast there too. Again, food quality was excellent and service was so so. Can you imagine the staff clear the plates and scrape the left-over food from one plate to the other in front of the guest before bringing the plates away?I see that the staff were polite and passionate. They just need more training and experience to make the hotel to full 5 star.After all the praises to this hotel, I would like to recommend the hotel to improve in environment consciousness. The normal shower gel/shampoo/conditioner in other hotels are around 30 - 40 ml each. Aman's is 150 ml each. If the guest stays for 1 night and he is not bringing the bottles home to use, quite a lot was wasted.","Hong Kong, China","Madeleinekam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",67,4.0

This is hands down the best hotel in Tokyo right now and we have stayed at them all.Stepping off the whisper quiet elevator into the lobby you're faced with the welcoming faces of the staff who live to make sure you are having an amazing time while you stay.Check-in is a smooth comfortable experience which takes place in the lobby along with your hot towel and welcome drink. The lobby is spectacular. Soaring ceilings of paper and walls of stone anchored by a large reflecting pool.The bar and lounge area as well as the fine dining restaurant are all located within and butt up against windows supplying amazing views of The Imperial Gardens and Tokyo.A tour of the facility is offered, though we chose to go right to the room.THE ROOM!...and what a room it is. The first part of our eight days (we checked out for Kyoto and back in for another four) we had a suite, which can only be described as Heaven. Sparse, well designed and brimming with the WOW factor I so appreciate. A touch of a button (bedside) releases two sets of electric shades which revel HUGE, huge windows overlooking the city. A very comfortable day bed sits underneath. A reading lamp and round table and chairs complemented this area. Next to this and working towards the opposite end of the room is the console which houses your TV, fridge, coffee ect. The TV is hidden within and raises from view at the touch of a remote button.Following is the bed area. The bed itself is a massive size and provides plenty of individual sleeping space. Each side of the bed includes a panel of buttons that control lighting for the room as well as temperature and house keeping calls.Ample closets space are seperated with a drawer system between. The closet also includes a safe and a basket for laundry and/or dry cleaning. We used both and were very satisfied. The bathroom is a large area including double stone sinks and depending on your room size a large or VERY large stone tub. This area also has an open rain shower. Floors are heated stone.The toilet is behind a sliding door and of course has a high end model TOTO. The suite included a large entrance area with door and the room was larger with a much larger bath area. Both this room and standard which he had the second check-in are beautiful.You will NOT be unhappy.THE POOL is so over the top its insane. I keep using the word HUGE, but it's HUGE. The surrounding deck area is equipped with large ""beds"" to relax on. There is a lifeguard and water bottles ect are available. The temperature is just right.THE GYM is not huge but is bigger than others and has every piece of equipment you could want for your workout. There are also Pilates and Yoga studios if you so need. We did not use the SPA areas but they looked great.FOOD. The main restaurant is located just off the lobby. Again large, large windows provide ample views.The food is very good. Breakfast everyday was yummy.There are ""set"" menus for both American and Japanese breakfasts as well as a la cart choices.The staff is so capable and loving.There is also a small second restaurant located off the hotel entrance outside.I really want to take the time to address other reviews of this hotel...The hotel is anything but Goth. If you even have a slight idea of what Goth represents it's not the AMAN.The design is Japanese. High end, MODERN, sparse, very placed. It is not about rugs and upholstered chairs or gold leaf accents. If that's what you're looking for than you can look elsewhere.To be disappointed in the design of a hotel or room which is clearly visible in every photo online prior to your trip is just bad planning on the travelers part.The toilet area of the room has a door which is also behind a sliding shoji screen wall.The staff ALL speak English. I had no problem communicating with anyone. My concierge emails were returned in clear and conscience writing concerning many lunch and dinner reservations.The general manager, Jeffrey Seward introduced himself to us and was very welcoming and helpful.Obviously we loved our stay here. On two separate occasions we brought Japanese friends who live in Tokyo to view the hotel. All were blown away. One is a very famous cosmetics mogul and can be the pickiest of the pickiest. She actually is booking a room for herself she was so impressed.One thing to note. If you are taking the N'EX from the airport and walk over it can be hard to find the entrance The main entrance where you depart your bus, car, cab is on the opposite side from where you would walk in coming from that direction.Go stay here. You will love it.","New York City, New York","Steve A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",16,5.0

English is a big problem here and it shouldn't be. The hotel generic email person doesn't type very well and couldn't tell me the predicted dates for the Cherry Blossom season. Waiters should understand English and not need to be told twice or three times in slow halting English. We're in an Aman here.The food produce is stellar. They use the best of the best ingredients and you get what you pay for. The rooms are spartan or what they call sophisticated Zen. They're really quite bare for what you're paying. Some of the furniture looks like it came from Misato IKEA. None of the oriental opulence found at the Mandarin Oriental or Shangri-la. I wish they had a door separating the bathroom from the bedroom because without it, you do end up hearing everything from the bathroom. The bathtub is a wonder though. Very deep and with a flowing spout.There's none of the name recognition and no bills signature necessary that is common at their warm weather resorts either.

The airy, spacious and absolutely stunning inner-roof and the overall serene feeling of the lobby despite the vastness of it all. Aman has arrived in Tokyo. Big time. And as a guest you really feel ""I have arrived!"".The room is probably the best/coolest designed hotel room we have ever stayed in. The lay-out of the room is similar to Amansara which is natural as Kerry Hill designed both. Light woods apart from the black stone bathroom and the black bathtub (almost like a plunge pool) from where you can enjoy the fabulous urban vista. And the hotel may be my overall winner in terms of design and looks. The halls, the pool, the spa - everything looks amazing.The service is very friendly and efficient but I would say that Peninsula in Tokyo still has the upper edge in terms of service. Aman Tokyo is only 6 months old though.Breakfast was very good but not fantastic. I would have preferred more to choose from. Views are great from all sides of the building. I'm not sure which view I would choose from my room. Maybe west side towards Imperial Palace and Shinjuku skyline in the distance is cooler but the bar and restaurant have that side so maybe you should go for a room on the other side - then you get a Tokyo view from most angles (the pool is to the South)All in all - one of the best hotel stays of all time for us.

Ok, maybe that’s a little extreme but the design is exceptional. The soaring ceiling of the lobby mixed with the quite of the bar and the hospitality of the reception makes your arrival both awe inspiring and personal; a combination rarely achieved. Pool is a stand out with glass windows that seem to go on forever and views 35 stories up over the imperial palace; swimming is a great way to get over jet lag btw. Rooms are large and the sunken granite tub in the bathroom was truly special. Breakfast was amazing, especially the Japanese breakfast. Been to many top Ryokan’s would say breakfast was on par (though maybe not as good as some). Anyway, I think most travelers staying at this small hotels are too hip to write tripadvisor reviews so I think its getting a bit unfairly treated and I wanted to have my say.

First of it is peaceful liked ryokan, it reminds me of Gora Kadan in peacefulness and exclusivity. The rooms are beautiful and very Japanese, I love the kimono option provided, the Japanese bath, the attention to details, not to mentioned the breakfast is so beautifully as well this presented in a seating arrangement in front of a full hight window with views of the city and so good it is clearly the best we have had in Tokyo and likely the best we have had in Japan. Also the pool is a complete retreat, the gym is small but state of the art both with great view, th lobby bar and lounge is peaceful, beautiful and very private. We where a little bit astounded By the restaurant, it would have been completely perfect with it to be fairly traditional Japanese so some sort of Mediterranean Japanese seemed such a strange presentation for a hotel that otherwise has refined what Japan is all about down to an art.To other reviewers and future guests I would say if you like to have a peaceful and private retreat from the madness of Tokyo you are going to love Aman however if you prefer happening and buzzling go elsewhere.The only setbacks I have are the fact that despite making no bookings with benefits of late check out and such, these benefits where extremely hard forr Aman to accommodate which was quit irritating taking into account we checked in at midnight!Also we at first felt concierge could have been a little more experienced, we used to have a hotel concierge in Tokyo with magic abilities however we ended up being extremely happy with that part of the hotel to. As we are a little tired of the whole Michelin star craze, been there done that and feel that in a city like Tokyo with so much great sushi it is a bit of a joke about the hype of certain places. There was just one restaurant we would have loved to try and when that was not possible asked to get some good no reservation required places for wagyu, sushi and izakaya and in regards to sushi the concierge was spot on with her recommendations, we could not have been happier and close to the hotel as well. Perhaps a little out of the way from Ebisu, Daikanyama, Nakameguro as well as Omotesando but close enough to Ginza. The fact that the metro is in the basement is great and ther are also som e restaurants there too.

But this is part of the AMAN experience, exclusivity, or in this case more exclusivity than other places, but less than the aman resorts. I need to disclose that I love the AMAN resorts. So, an AMAN hotel was an experiment that I wanted to be part of it. The elevators take you up to the 33rd floor, where you enter a different world. The lobby space, which also includes the bar and the restaurant, is really great with a ceiling reaching several stories up and an amazing view of the city. The surrounding is minimal and Japanese. Our room had the same great view. We were at the side of the building that you wake up in the morning and you see Mt. Fuji, if the weather permits. This was a nice treat! The room and the facilities are great. The spa and the pool are top notch. We had a chance to use both. At the spa, I explained an injury I had and they really personalized the “treatment”. The staff overall was extremely polite, and accommodating. One day in the early morning, like 6 am, I went out running, by the time I was back, they made sure that there was water and a towel right at the entrance of the hotel. I know that they have always water available, but it appeared that they made sure that this day was in place by the time I came back as it was not there when I left. The food at the restaurant both for dinner and breakfast were very good quality and with good variety. So, overall, we had a great stay and we would go back again. If I had to compare it with other hotel, it is right there on the top. If I had to compare it with other AMAN resorts, like the AMANs in Bali for example, there is a feeling of exclusivity and extreme pampering that you get in the resorts than is not there in the AMAN hotel.","Baltimore, Maryland","nikosstephanietasos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",63,5.0

Usually, I stay at the Peninsula as I love it's location and service. This year, when I heard the Aman had opened, I decided to split my time between the two hotels. I'm torn as to which one I like better as each one has it's strong and weak points.The Peninsula's location can't be beat. It's right by the Imperial Palace. Since I run every morning during my stay, being near the park is essential. After my 4:30 am run, I usually stop by the gym. The hotel has figured out how to allow 24 hour access to the gym with no extra effort and has a small moderately equipped gym that is always way to hot but it is well stocked with cold water and fruit. The Aman also allows 24 hour access to the gym but, in order to access the gym, you have to go to the front desk on the 33rd floor, ask for access, go back to the 34th floor, wait for them to unlock the gate then take another elevator back down to the 33rd floor. Way too much work at 4:30 am!Breakfast at the Peninsula is fine. With the breakfast package, you get a juice, coffee/tea, eggs and meat and pastries. At the Aman, breakfast is a feast! Three shots of juice (their green juice is amazing- the best I have ever had), fruit juice, coffee/tea, fruit platter, yogurt, pastry basket, eggs and meat! I was stuffed.The rooms are nice at both hotels, though different in decor. The separate dressing room and bedroom door at the Peninsula are helpful as is the master controller that includes a clock (essential) and temperature. They also have nice touches like plastic bags for your wet clothes and terry robes and yukatas (lightweight cotton kimono like robes). Fresh fruit and water is given every day.The Aman has fabulous views from their rooms and an amazing Japanese bathtub. The complimentary water and sodas are much appreciated and a standard amenity at all Amans.Customer service is unparalleled at The Aman. After I checked in (which takes a little time as they made me wait 10 minutes before someone came to check me in), all of the staff knew my name and would greet me as they saw me. At The Aman, breakfast service was fast and efficient. I was seated immediately and served shortly after. They were extremely accommodating and, at my request, made a few changes to their set menu. Upon check out, they had a taxi waiting for me and the bell staff waited until I pulled away to wave goodbye.At The Peninsula, the service is pleasant but more impersonal . Every morning, I had to wait for several minutes before I was acknowledged and seated. Once my order was taken and breakfast served, my server disappeared.

You come here for secluded luxury in the heart of one of the world's biggest cities. Don't come for buzz or crowds or gold fittings and crystal chandeliers. The main lobby on the 33rd floor is just simply breath taking. Five story high atrium, Japanese zen gardens in the middle, black volcanic stone on the walls, spectacular views of the city.Our room was amazing. Corner suite. Huge size. Incredible views of the imperial palace grounds and looking south towards Tokyo station. The hotel is brand new - rooms are in perfect condition. Electronic blinds and curtains, electronic lighting controls everywhere. Lots of storage space. Desk/study area. Two toilets. Spectacular walk in shower and bath, with views of the city.We had breakfast in our room every morning. The food was excellent and delivered EXACTLY at the time requested, every time.Service is outstanding. Staff were very friendly and attentive and went out of their way to help, without being overbearing or intrusive. Concierge arranged all of our restaurant reservations for our whole stay in Tokyo.

We took the Express train from Narita Int'l Airport to Tokyo Station. We only had carry-on luggage, so we walked to the hotel, as it is only 5 minutes on foot via Tokyo Station. The staff were all pleasant and fluent in English. The lobby is spacious and filled with (super) dressed-up people sipping tea, which was sort of intimidating for us hayseeds in our Nikes. The rooms were superb--blond chestnut flooring, ridiculously massive bed (it had to be larger than a standard king), and dark stone bathroom equipped with $7,000 USD toilets--heated seats, customizable bidet action, dual flush, automatic sensors that lift the seat when you walk in during the middle of the night, the whole nine yards. We would learn that these toilets are not uncommon in Tokyo, but they blew my mind.The only meal we ate at the Aman Tokyo was a breakfast, which was high quality and reasonably priced. The fruit platter was excellent. The coffee was pretty good, but there is also a Dean & Deluca next door to the hotel.The location of the hotel was great. We were worried that we would be stuck in a business-centric part of town, and while the nearby streets were definitely filled with suits, there were many activities for tourists in the surrounding area (including shopping and dining options). I don't know what else to say beyond that. It checks off every box on the list: it is cool and exciting while still being calm and quiet, it is really, really fancy without being stuffy. it would be ideal for business travelers, as it is centrally located and very modern with many amenities. It is also perfect for leisure travelers (couples, families, or otherwise), and the rooms are decorated in a distinctively Japanese way, which made it way more fun than staying in the rooms at the Ritz or Mandarin, which looked sterile and unimaginative in comparison (on internet photos, at least). this was our 2nd stay at an Aman and my family and I are completely sold","Hickman, Nebraska, United States","Chip K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hickman, Nebraska, United States</strong>",10,5.0

The Aman concierge did not reply for a week - we sent repeated emails and finally got a reply after an email of complaint. Once we made contact with the concierge the overall tone of the exchange was warm and very enjoyable, so we requested they look in to some Sumo tickets for us. Tickets could only be secured for a day we were staying at another hotel - so they recommended we ask that concierge! Not as accommodating as we expected, and a bit of a disappointment given the price point.

The first reception downstairs was a helpful addition and made us feel welcome even before we entered the magnificent lobby. My wife is rarely overwhelmed by hotel design but the enormous lantern ceiling and interior garden to compliment the full length windows running along 3 sides both impressed and gave a sense of intense well-being. We were ushered smoothly to the spa for a treatment before relaxing beside the pool, and what a pool! I believe it to be the longest hotel pool in Tokyo and the beds flanking the water were a delightful spot to rest before we completed check in. The staff remained constantly smiling and helpful at the slightest bidding, and never made us feel demanding.Our entry level room was no less magnificent for not being a suite, and had expansive views of the imperial gardens from both bed area and the bathroom. The use of dark stone throughout the hotel and room is extremely consistent, and the camphor wood and bath evoke the traditional qualities of Japan in a luxurious setting. Every aspect of the room has been thought through with great care and attention including global plug sockets by the bed, room for a desk both behind the bed and at the window where you have a separate sitting and reclining area. The TV has been cleverly hidden to leave unobstructed views, while the sliding screens afford complete intimacy when your partner is in the bathroom. Light streams into every corner of the bedroom and mirrors are also artfully placed. Breakfast both continental and Japanese was delicious and prettily presented, and the waiters/waitresses were disarmingly sweet and hospitable with a genuine desire to help in every way. We encountered the same experience at lunch and dinner, and were impressed by our one italian dish tasted in Tokyo (my wife is italian hence picky) and the excellent choice of wines from the sommelier. I was hoping to try a number of exclusive and difficult to access restaurants in Tokyo and the senior concierge Cullen Ozaki and his team were of great assistance in making the trip special. No task was too great including the organisation of a private Iaido sword class, the perfect sushi experience at Sushi Tokami in Ginza and the booking of the train tickets for our next leg.We will without a doubt revisit the Aman, and it is one of the best romantic hotel experiences we have ever had.",London,"Austin A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",86,5.0

The experience was so wonderful that while we were there we booked another stay for October. The design is otherworldly. When we first saw the lobby, we were left without words. I thought perhaps we had died on the shinkansen and were in the lobby of heaven. The 25 meter high volume is a giant glowing paper lantern. The rest of the hotel is clad in black basalt. There is a small zen garden in the middle. There was even someone playing the koto. Rarely, am I so moved by design. There are only about 85 rooms. Our corner suite was beautiful--understated and airy, with a large bathroom and soaking tub all in the same basalt, shoji screens, perfect bed, the list goes on. We had a killer view of Mt. Fuji. Even the hallways are perfectly done. We never saw a single outlet, cord, cleaning cart, etc. The spa and pool are fantastic. The service was impeccable. Shimizu-san, the lobby manager, is a gem. She'll help you with anything you need, and make you feel as if you're the only guests in the hotel. The only nit we had is that the bar staff was a little confused by simple drinks (Kettle One up with a twist was, for some reason, difficult).

I thought I might be disappointed, but walking into the lobby the first time (and each time after) was very impressive. We were given a quick tour by the lobby manager before being shown to our room, and you will be awestruck by the view from your room as well as the elegance and simplicity of the decor. All the shoji doors were shut at first, but then opening up the doors reveals a fantastic bath/wet area in the bedroom and then a hidden work desk and half bath behind the shoji doors in the living area. We were first given a room facing north (view of Sky Tree) which was a little noisy due to nearby construction (serious earth-drilling activity) but were comfortably moved to a south facing room with views of Tokyo Tower, Palace, Rainbow Bridge/Tokyo Bay, Odaiba, Haneda and Mt Fuji. Our room had much of a city apartment living feel, including a dishwasher. The room has very effective blackout drapes, but an issue I have with many hotels with all the fancy control buttons is the bright lights that stay illuminated on the buttons all night.The hotel is a short walk from Tokyo Station and can be accessed completely underground. There is a bit of construction but we went towards B1 exit and Ootemori signs to get to the hotel via underground. Hotel signage is not that obvious from street level. There are maps around that mark Otemachi Tower and Mizuho, and seeing pictures of the building helps identify too.There isn't much that is eco about the hotel. Some tree-huggers might be upset by that. Used towels were replaced twice a day, soap was replaced every other day it seemed. Breakfast set menus are enormous. There is western and Jpns options with ingredients sourced throughout Japan. The pool is beautiful, towering ceilings. It is 30m long and 25m long from stair entry to stair entry (so there is one end to swim 30m lengths). The pool is about 31deg C (88deg F) which is a tad warm for laps. One of my biggest pet peeves is when people don't rinse before entering the pool, so there were a few times where I could taste people's perfume in the water when they entered. Disgusting. There is a shower poolside, please rinse thoroughly before entering the pool. The gym has standard hotel cardio and machines, plus a rower and pullup cage, studios for yoga and pilates (most equipment except the Cadillac). Swim and exercise gear can be borrowed from locker room attendant. The spa has great bath facilities including steam, hot bath and cold water rinse. The first day I asked about a swimsuit spin/dryer and a couple days later they had one installed! The spa treatments are very nice (and expensive) and in a room with natural light, so they're not in a dark corner like most typical treatment rooms. There were some very minor kinks before and during our stay which is probably just part of getting started. There were staff from different Aman properties during our visit to help with the soft opening. We bounce around to different hotels each time we visit Tokyo, but it might be hard to top Aman, even with the upcoming St Regis and Hoshinoya properties. The hotel lobby was never really busy or buzzing at the bar. I'm not sure if that's the intent, but it definitely has a remote resort feeling. We didn't really leave the hotel much except for lunch and dinner. It's a very relaxing and pampering setting.","New York, NY","trippyNYC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",137,5.0

An absolute MUST DO is the journey to the Tsukiji Fish Market with Chef Oba + dinner at his sushi restaurant. It was the best meal either of us have ever had, and Chef Oba is a delight to spend time with. We were a little disappointed with the lack of Japanese food on their menu -- though I'm sure that's something they'll likely sort out in due time. The swimming pool is great, as is the spa.

I've been to the Aman resorts in Bali so I was naturally curious to see how they'd pull off a hotel in the most urban setting possible. Well it's stunning and the execution of the staff is nearly perfect in spite of only being open to the public for 6 weeks. The hotel did an excellent job of getting my arrival details arranged but I was traveling lightly wanted to walk from Tokyo Station (having arrived from Narita) to the hotel. They suggested, with good reason, that a taxi would have been the preferred mode, for arriving in the evening. The hotel itself is difficult to find in the dark even though it's a 3 block walk. The signage is much more visible in the daylight. Having found the building, Aman took over and escorted me every step of the way through the checkin process. The lobby on the 33rd floor is a jaw-dropper and photographs do nothing to describe what it's like in person. The ceiling opens up several floors, covered in japanese paper in a huge space. The whole effect is dark stone, white paper and abundant wood. I had booked the deluxe room (entry level) because of the view towards the Imperial Palace. The room was very large by any standard (70+ sq m) and the space was put to excellent use. Like the lobby, the room is stone, wood and white paper. The Aman Tokyo design concepts are sparse and have been called zen-like. For me this was flawlessly executed. For others, if this style doesn't resonate, then this is NOT the hotel to stay in. The minimal design ethic is implemented throughout the room, the bath and the sitting area facing the window. Everything is automated, including the toilet (as is standard in Japan.) I had breakfast twice in the lobby, once western-style and once Japanese style. Again the execution of the staff was perfect and the meals were excellent. On checkout, I was heading to Kyoto via Shinkansen and the staff arranged transport back to the Tokyo Station and had an assistant help me purchase tickets. My bags had custom Aman luggage tags with my name printed, a very nice touch. Hotel quality in Tokyo is very, very high indeed and having stayed at the Four Seasons, The Ritz Carlton, and the Park Hyatt, I would certainly put the Aman at the top of that list; not only in Tokyo but world-wide.","San Francisco, California","ebaypoet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",25,5.0
