They are a happy and very accommodating group and will do everything they can to make your stay memorable. We are definitely staying only here on our next trip to NYC. This is a perfect hotel for people travelling with kidsPros1. 5 mins walk to Times square and empire state building/macy's 2. Kitchen and utensils in your room if you dont want to eat out. They have everything you need (1 non stick and 2 normal pots and pans, cutlery, knife, plates, bowls, glasses etc and a stove top and a full fridge, dishwasher, washing liquid)3. Breakfast in morning and to go boxes for kids. Good variety, but can do more for vegetarians given a lot of people are converting now to vegan and vegetarian4. Excellent service from staff. They provide all the comfort they can. I had an issue with my room rate, they resolved it at check in. I needed a taxi they ran to the corner of st and got me one. Needed a box for my child to take some food for the day, and it was not a problem.5. Free teas and coffee throughout the day. Not a big consumer myself but it makes lot of difference to some people. Areas of improvement1. More variety in breakfast for vegetarians. Mix it up a little as when someone is staying 3-4 days or a week it is good to have some variety. I know they changed 2 items mostly but with the price and how much people love breakfast here I think the team can do much better. A live omlette bar/pancakes bar will be a dream come true :)","London, United Kingdom","Travellove18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",43,5.0

We reserved our stay online using the Hilton HHonors website. Although we are Diamond members, we did not receive any kind of an upgrade (such as to a higher floor; in fact, we could not have been on any lower of a floor!). The Manhattan Homewood Suites property is located on West 37th Street in Chelsea. We chose this property because it was located between Port Authority (where we parked our car) and Madison Square Garden (where we had tickets to see the Eagles Hotel California tour). Many shops and restaurants are located just steps from the hotel, although the shops are more of the souvenir variety and the restaurants are more functional than destination dining. (We ate at the full-service Houndstooth Irish Pub nearby, which was better-than-expected; see our separate review. We also had some food at Doylers Irish Pub at the Hilton Garden Inn just a few doors away; see our separate review.)Public spaces include a high-ceilinged lobby, with areas for the front desk/pantry store, overflow breakfast seating at regular-height tables, one high-top communal table with charging ports, a two-sided gas fireplace, a wall with a lovely glass waterfall feature, and some comfy lounge seating. Three elevators whisk guests to the floors above. There is some narrow outdoor space through the rear of the building, as well as an area that overlooks the basement-level fitness center. A buffet breakfast area that can be closed off doubles as luggage storage in the afternoon and evening. The hotel offers a rooftop terrace in warmer weather. Our studio suite was located on the second floor, which has a sort of atrium feature because it is open to the lobby below. Our room overlooked West 37th Street, and although initially we wished that we had been assigned a higher floor, the second floor proved interesting because we could watch the pedestrian and vehicle traffic on the street below from our own private floor-to-ceiling window. We entered our room near the bathroom, which was an acceptable size for one person at a time, including a small sink vanity, toilet, and a long but narrow standing shower (no bathtub). An adjacent closet offered plenty of storage space, including a hang bar and shelving unit as well as space to hold our suitcase on a luggage rack so that we could then close everything away behind doors; the closet even had a light as well as a large safe, iron, and tabletop ironing board. The main room contained a small kitchenette at one end (with an apartment-sized refrigerator/freezer, small sink, microwave, two-burner stovetop, and tiny dishwasher, as well as the cups, plates, utensils, and cookware necessary to prepare a simple meal). A king-size bed occupied the middle of the room (across from which was the wall-mounted TV), small chest of drawers, desk (with a roll-out extension below it), with an end table and small sofa with ottoman (which unfolded to expand the surface) near the windows. We liked the layout of this studio suite because of the extra space and comfort it provided. (Note that there is no door between the living and sleeping areas in the junior suite.)We enjoyed our stay at the Homewood Suites Midtown Manhattan Times Square South, and we would stay there again.",Pennsylvania,"fluffnfold</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>",920,4.0

I had to cancel my upcoming trip due to the Covid-19 virus. I booked through a third-party service and could not get through due to the high call volume. I called the hotel directly on told them what was happening. Per the third-party agreement the hotel did not have to work with me, but I spoke with Jeanette who went out of her way to talk with management. Both management and Jeanette understood the situation and agreed to refund my money even though they did not have to. This is an honest, friendly business. I will be rescheduling my trip and I will absolutely stay in this hotel. This is a time when businesses could take advantage of others, but this business did the socially responsible thing. I am very grateful. I have spent a lot of time in NYC and know that this is a great location. I look forward to rescheduling soon.

I think 3 things are critical to a hotel stay so always prioritize reviewing the property location, a good night's rest, and a good morning shower:LOCATION: 4.5/5. Located in the garment district (lost of clothes re-sellers), about a 10 minute walk from either Times Square or Penn Station - exactly perfect for not having to drag your bags very far while also being close to the action and good subway stations.GOOD SLEEP: 5/5 Comfortable bedding, room was quiet, and no issues at all.SHOWER: 4.5/5 Hot water and good pressure. Average toiletries. Nice sized walk in shower with door.....but the door didn't close all the way and the seal was cracked in a few places which resulted in some water leaking out after every shower that needed to be cleaned up.....but I forgot to tell them about the problem, so some of that is my fault too. Other Comments:- FREE coffee and tea and water in the lobby- 2 FREE bottles of water on arrival for our HH status- We arrived VERY early at 9:45 AM for our evening stay and were expecting to just leave our bags BUT they surprised us by going ahead and checking us in AND invited us to grab a bite of what was left at breakfast.- Speaking of breakfast - it is GREAT and FREE. Much more comprehensive and nice than average hotel continental - they had juices, coffees, teas, fruit, oatmeal, pastries, muffins, hot eggs, hot sausage/ meat, potatoes, and some kind of (varied by day) waffle/ pancake/ french toast. This is a huge convenient value in NYC and probably saves you $10-$15 per person. - Complimentary newspaper- Staff were all friendly and helpful.- The hotel lobby is very nice and inviting with nice spaces to hang out and relax near the fireplace. The rooms was fairly modern and in good shape.We had previously stayed right next to Times Square at hotels that probably charge 40% more per night AND now have started charging an extremely insulting $30 per day resort charge for things that are free or unnecessary (land line phone, WIFI, etc).....so this place is a gem. Particularly if you want to split being close to Penn Station and Times Square. We will definitely be back - nice place!!","Baltimore, Maryland","usflyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Baltimore, Maryland</strong>",754,5.0

This was new to me! We left our luggage behind at the hotel, went sightseeing, and returned later in the afternoon to complete our check in process. This is very bad PR. It would have been better to simply say that no rooms were available.We were looking forward to their complimentary evening social hour (advertised on their website) prior to attending a Broadway play, only to find that it does not exist. This is false advertising. We left the hotel and found a happy hour elsewhere.Our hotel room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom had limited vanity space, in that there is no where to place your personal items. We were told that our room had "" a nice city view"". We overlooked an office building, which blocked out any daylight.There was a kitchenette in our room, which is of value if you are using it. We were staying for one overnight, so did not use it. Breakfast the following morning was busy, and the offerings were so/so. The workers were courteous and were trying to replenish items quickly.The location of this hotel is conviently located between Penn Station and the theater district. For us, this is well positioned. However, there are several hotels in this area, and for us, we will probably look elsewhere on our next visit to NYC. Homewood Suites is on the higher end costwise of hotels in that area.

The first morning, I woke up at 10:00 am only to realize I would miss breakfast if I didn't hurry and get downstairs. My brother and I left the safe open with our items inside, including my wallet. I came back 30 minutes later to realize that someone (cleaning staff) had come into the room to make the bed. An extra blanket was left on-top not folded at all and no clean towels were left. My brother and I thought this was strange that only the bed was made and nothing else cleaned or tidied all within 30 minutes. Fast forward to checking out the following day. We do a thorough check of the room to make sure nothing is left behind, literally nothing. I arrive at the airport to leave and for some reason I cannot find my wallet. I panic and search all my things. I call the hotel and ask them to do another check of the room. I'm told they have found it... in the safe, which is totally not accurate. I'm then told I will need to fill out an online form, which will need to include a photo of my passport and visa so the wallet can be sent back to me in Toronto. The form allows you to select how fast you would like the delivery to be. I ask for two days. The lost and found contact for the hotel however, doesn't work on this particular Saturday and therefore doesn't see my request until Monday.

We enjoyed an extended stay, and, the staff was unfailingly friendly and helpful. Our experience in that regard was well above average. The Hilton brand is well represented here and we have enjoyed staying at many of their hotels. The quality of accommodations is good. Guests are offered a buffet breakfast bar. Food was OK but not equal to Hilton's best breakfast offerings. The rooms generally are spacious, clean and comfortable. We liked having a kitchenette including full size fridge, sink, small stove top, and, a dishwasher in the room. Bathrooms have ample space and include a walk-in shower. Bedding was just right. Heating and air worked well. WiFi was excellent. Elevators are busy and require a room key to get to any floor except the lobby level. The key detectors in the elevators did not work consistently. That can slow down the process and has almost no security benefit as tail gating is prevalent. But overall ride times were not excessive. Many guests expressed some frustration with having to use keys to run the elevators. Since the system is so simply defeated, it is just a nuisance. The TV was flat screen with one premium channel. Some channels suffered from buffering due we assume to network issues. There is a small laundry on site where guests can wash and dry their clothes for $3.50 per load. The hotel needs to install a clothes rack for hanging up wrinkle free garments. There is a folding table. The fitness center is very nice.We enjoyed being centrally located in the garment district, not far from Times Square, the theater district, Hudson Yard, Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. With The Port Authority terminal and multiple subway stations nearby we found getting around the city pretty easy. There are Uber, Lyft and taxi rides for portal to portal travel although we like Dial 7 car service which is about as cheap or cheaper depending on the time of day, and, more reliably available.. There is a Brooklyn Fare grocery store close by as well as both Duane Reade and CVS pharmacies. Several banks have walk-in locations within a short walk. CityMD, a walk-in clinic, faces 8th Av between 33rd and 34th St, within easy walking distance. There are lots of restaurants nearby. We found the most visitor friendly place was the Essen Slow Fast Food restaurant on 8th Av and 36th St where you serve yourself buffet style just the kinds and amounts of food you want, then pay by the pound. Their selection of freshly prepared food was impressive. They have a some seating but we usually brought our food back to the room as Essen was only a short walk away from the hotel. We will definitely stay at Homewood Suites again on a future visit.

Those reviews probably helped reduce any potential disappointment I could have faced. I was impressed with the free flow of coffee, tea and hot water in the lobby that guests can help themselves to throughout the day. The breakfast spread was limited however, it was helpful to kick start the day with some food before exploring the city. The hotel also does provide boxes for guest to take out their breakfast, and I suppose it is because of the limited seats they have (that unfortunately cannot cater for the hotel's capacity). The rooms did not feel as small as I thought it might be. The cooking area felt a bit awkward and the size of the sink was quite small so food preparation was a bit tough and we ended up only cooking breakfast on certain days. Around the corner of the hotel was a 7-11 store and the hotel has its own ""mini-mart"" in the event you might want to get something from there. There are food places near by as well. The hotel was a short walk (about 5 min) to the subway (34st-penn station) or about 7 min walk to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. It was convenient as the subway lines (A, C, E) that pass the station that served the purpose of our travel destinations and only on occasions did we need to change lines. One thing about the area the hotel was located in - the streets in this area smelt more (i.e. of weed and cigarettes) as compared to some of the other areas of NYC. The subway station also had homeless people taking shelter. It took a while to get used to it and it helped that most times, the station had other commuters entering and exiting. My friend did not like the hotel as much because of the area that it was in. There was a front desk staff in the hotel that was observed to try and make the stay pleasant through their smiles and hospitality. As the title says - It was a place I started to be comfortable with even finding my favourite coffee place at the next street. There were many things that could have been better, however every hotel would have its limitations, and for this hotel, it's familiarity after the long stay, its convenience to the subway, and different parts of the city, the one staff that was friendly, the room that I could rest comfortably in, and the memories I built in my trip while staying there has left fond memories.","Singapore, Singapore","Hwieeee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",19,3.0

I am very happy with my decision. We got there a couple of hours before check in, but because I am a Hilton Honors member I was allowed to check in early for free. I even got to pick what floor I wanted out of the available rooms, which I thought was very nice. The room was spacious and very clean. Everything looked new, nothing was rundown or worn out. The furniture and bed were very comfortable. The view was of offices, but I wasn’t expecting a spectacular view, so it was ok. There is a loveseat, office chair for the desk, and ottoman. There is also a tray that unfolds so you can eat at the loveseat, or pull it over to the bed if you need to, which I appreciated. The ottoman was so nice to have to put your feet up after walking all day. The room was very quiet, we never heard any outside noise while we were there, which is unusual for a busy hotel. The shower had good water pressure, and water (I think we’ve all stayed in hotels where you feel like it takes forever to get shampoo out of your hair). The bathroom was a little small, but very nice. The breakfast had a lot of options, we really enjoyed it. There were eggs, potatoes, meat, and pancakes at the hot station. There was another station with toast and bagels. The third station was drinks, milk, cereal, fruit, yogurt and oatmeal. The staff was so friendly. There is one gentleman, I don’t know his name, that was so pleasant to everyone. I think he said he was from Florida, he was cleaning off the tables each morning we went down, his kindness to every guest stood out to me. Check out time is noon, which is basically unheard of in most hotels. We loved that because we had a later flight and were exhausted from walking. I would definitely stay here again.

It was completely sold out and they did a magnificent job! We stayed in a large suite with two beds and a couch as we're a family of five. We checked our bags and went off exploring. Some complain that their rooms aren't ready earlier than check in but seriously, I'd rather check my bags and get a later check out time. All staff from kitchen help to management were amazing. I don't know how they do it with the crowds but they were the most friendly and efficient I've ever seen. I read a complaint about the breakfasts but seriously, what a well oiled machine they run at this hotel. I was there on sold out days and yes, maybe you had to wait for a few people to get your food but it wasn't anything to cry over. There were plenty of tables and again, maybe you had to wait a few minutes but we never did. There was one kitchen helper who directed you to where there was an empty table. Another complaint I read was there was no bacon or sausage. The breakfasts meat seems to change daily. We had sausages one day and corned beef hash another. Sorry but Ewwww.. to corn beefed hash but there were plenty of other alternatives to eat. Most surprising were the to go boxes provided and the trays to take your food up to your room. There were many guests packing up tons of fruit and pastries, which I found ridiculous. Even though the hoarders were taking large amounts of food, there was ALWAYS plenty available. They didn't run out. One lady checking out had several apples and bananas on the top of her bag! Most places put out a certain amount of fruit on a first come, first serve. Not the Homewood Suites! Very efficient, plenty of food and much faster than going to a local diner in the city. Well done Homewood Suites! Best place to stay if you're a family of five!","Birmingham, Alabama","ilymom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",59,5.0

(They did call 911 but nothing beyond that) Our last morning, we went to breakfast in the very crowded lobby. Upon entering the breakfast area, there was a guest unconscious and struggling to breathe in the position he was in. Two Homewood suites employees stared at him while having a discussion with another guest. Very casual considering the circumstances. I mentioned that the gentleman needed to be positioned differently to open his airway. The staff told me I was not allowed to touch him. I was not going to stand by and do nothing or let this poor guy die with no one helping him. When I moved him to a flat surface I noticed he didn’t have a pulse. My husband then requested the portable defibrillator and they refused to give it to him because “the ambulance was on the way”. I’m just a mom, wife, daughter.....not a nurse or doctor but I knew something needed to be done THEN and we couldn’t wait for the ambulance. I started CPR at that point but feel that if the hotel had someone trained in first aid (or at least how to use the portable defibrillator) this situation would not have become so dire for this gentleman. I pray that the EMT was able to stabilize him. Definitely a traumatic experience for everyone in the lobby (which they never cleared people out of...even after EMS started working on the gentleman) To make a long story longer, my recommendation is that this location needs major management changes.",,O4863DZamyc,0,3.0

Do you rely on Trip Advisor, Travel Agency, Friends and Family or just stick a pin in the map and hope. First off, decide the location you want to be in, secondly decide upon your budget and thirdly, look at what other travellers are saying on this or similar sights. For me it was a mixture of all of these. The location was the primary, then the reviews. The layout of New York means that most attractions in Manhattan and Lower Central Park are easily walkable from this hotel, with time and good shoes you can easily stroll to Chelsea, and at a push Downtown. The hotel was clean and the staff inviting, The rooms are clean and airy, even a double, although smaller than other American hotels I had stayed in, but I guess that is New York. It has all you would need for a comfotable stay, my only criticism was the Fridge was quite noisy but after the third day I got used to it. We had a room at the back of the hotel, that was super quiet athough I did feel that I was intruding into other peoples' lives, but I guess that it city living. We had a bed and breakfast option, and the breakfasts, whilst simple set you up for the day and the 24 hour tea and coffee was most welcome. All in all a pleasant stay and I would certainly be back. The hotel also has the benefit of a roof terrace for night-time views.","Leicester, United Kingdom","Simon512</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leicester, United Kingdom</strong>",16,4.0

I have tried 6 hotels in the area of W. 36th Street to W. 38th Street and the Homewood Suites is definitely one of the best, if not the best hotel, in the area.The hotel is new, the rooms are spacious, and is an outstanding value for the area.The rooms are great. They are spacious by New York standards - there is a king size bed, a desk, a couch and a small kitchenette (microwave, 2 burner stove, refrigerator, dishes). I don't cook much on the road, but the kitchen allows me to reheat leftovers from a prior evening's dinner. The bathroom is also new, neat clean and relatively spacious. Unlike other nearby hotels, the closet is actually well designed. The floors have a nice hardwood look and the overall room appears new and modern.One big advantage to the Homewood Suites is the included breakfast buffet, unlike many of the other mid-market hotels in the immediate area. It's a solid buffet - typically consisting of cereals, breads, scrambled eggs, potatoes, yogurts, etc. The quality of the food is pretty good - they add a gourmet touch when they can (e.g., green onions sprinkled on the eggs).The hotel is convenient - there is an Orange Theory across the street, a dry cleaner practically next door and a 7-11, CVS and Duane Reed within a 5 minute walk. The hotel is useful for the business traveler, but offers an even better value proposition for small families with young children. Having a kitchenette and breakfast buffet will really help keep the family fed and going.","Huntington Beach, California","vikast_11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach, California</strong>",49,5.0

We didn't really know what to do in the meantime as it was pouring rain outside but we made our way to a nearby restaurant.

We liked our room location and the layout of the room.Beds were very comfortable, room was clean, good shower pressure & temperature, great room lighting.We really enjoyed the breakfast each morning.

I was there for an especially rainy stretch and it was easy to get dry and deal with raincoat and umbrella without making a mess in the room. The windows were effective and blocking out street noise although it's NYC so some sound gets through.The staff at the breakfast in the morning were especially friendly and helpful and the breakfast was generally good with many cold and hot options although I wouldn't describe it as fancy.My only real negatives on this stay were an unusually long wait to get a key in the evening when I arrived (only one desk staff and a very confused foreign guest with many questions in front of me) and somewhat dim bulbs in the various lamps in the room. 37th Street is not the greatest as it's dark and perpetually covered by scaffolding on adjacent buildings, but I never felt specifically at risk. About two blocks West from the hotel is a large grocery store, Brooklyn Fare, and a few blocks away in several directions are various subway stops as well as a short walk to either the Port Authority Bus terminal or Penn Station for longer-distance travel. A little over one block to the East is 7th Ave which is lined with decent casual restaurants and a few blocks south closer to 6th Ave is Herald Square with the famous Macy's store and a collection of other shops and restaurants.I ended up here as my usual stop closer to my office was fully booked, but I'll be returning often in the weeks and months ahead as I really found this Homewood Suites comfortable and convenient.","Los Angeles, California","cb4444</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",36,5.0

We stayed at this property at the beginning of our trip and at the end (total of 10 nights). Facilities - Whilst not a 5 star hotel, it has everything that you could want in a hotel in the middle of NYC. Well appointed rooms, Laundry facilities, Comfortable small lounge area, Breakfast, Ice Machine, Free Coffee/tea/hot chocolate. It was a super busy hotel when we were there but it didn't really affect our use of these facilities. The 3 elevators worked hard but no longer than 1-2 minute wait. Only suggestion I can make, is for the size of the hotel, they might need 1-2 more washer/dryer machines in their laundry room - This to account for people who don't keep an eye on washing/drying times.Room - We had a room with 2 queen beds and a kitchen. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Room was spacious and (personal choice) I liked that it didn't have carpet on the floors. Kitchen has a full sized fridge, hot plates, dishwasher, microwave, sink and the essential utensils. Whilst we didn't fully utilise the kitchen, it was so convenient to have it there. Rooms were clean, bright and airy. We found it reasonably quiet given its location, only street noise we heard were the fire engine or police car sirens. Good air-conditioning - not too noisy. Only minor issue we had with our second room (1905) was that the refrigerator was noisy and the smoke alarm would light up intermittently. This room is also right in front of the elevator which can be noisy depending on the guests.Location - Loved the location and one of the best things about this property. Located in the Garment District, it was central to everything and minutes away from Time Square, Penn station, other subway stations, Hell's Kitchen, Hudson Yards etc. Streets felt safe even later in the evening. Staff - Front desk/Concierge were generally friendly. Stand out staff for us, was Jackson who worked the breakfast shift. Super friendly and helpful. He really made an effort with the guests (not just us) and made us all feel welcome. JL (duty manager) was also fantastic. We watched him interacting with the guests and helping where he could. Both are a credit to the Hilton brand.Only issue we had was with house keeping who regularly gave us 2-3 bath towels instead of the 4 we needed. This happened irrespective of whether we left a tip or not for house keeping. Breakfast - During the time we stayed there, we found that there was enough variety to satisfy both hot and cold options. The food choice isn't extensive but given it was free (or part of our booking), we couldn't complain. Breakfast gets busy from about 8.30 am onwards. You need to be an early bird to avoid the crowd.Would I stay here again? Definitely! We really could not fault our stay.","Cockburn, Australia","88jazzy88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cockburn, Australia</strong>",11,5.0

Security is well done, with key access to floors necessary in the elevators. We found the bed somewhat soft, but not uncomfortable. Air conditioning quiet and powerful. Large TV with multiple channels, but almost exclusively in English. Excellent elevators, which is necessary given the number of floors (22). Although this was the smallest Homewood suite we've ever been in, room size (we had the King efficiency with sofa) was reasonable for NYC. Unusual for Homewood, lighting for reading was marginal. As well, the room could have used some light maintenance - squeaky hinges on bathroom door and dresser. The breakfast area is somewhat undersized, but the hotel makes up for this by having several friendly folks cleaning tables, and when the weather cooperates, there's a pleasant outside area for breakfast. For a quiet room, request an even numbered room. This will have you facing apartments, so not much of a view, but you'll escape any street noise. All in all, we'd recommend this place for a first stay in New York.","Vancouver, Canada","Larry M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",64,5.0

The shower didn’t drain after each use. It took a full half hour to drain between showers. Since we didn’t notice this until the morning we were leaving we had no choice but to deal with it.

It was a much smaller room than what I had paid for...only two queen beds and a very small bathroom, and add to that the A/C was barely working.Mind you, when I checked in, no one informed me I wasn't getting the room I paid for. So, I went downstairs and informed them, wrong room. They informed me that the hotel was full and I could move tomorrow. Nothing was offered to me at all to reimburse me for the difference in the room.Next day, packed up our bags, brought them down...and when we returned to the hotel around 5pm, guess what? Room wasn't ready. So, we sat in the lobby for 25 minutes waiting for them to get their act together.I really don't ask much, I just wanted the room I paid for, and would have appreciated them informing me on check in and at least apologizing.Pretty sure if I hadn't said something they would have just left me in that smaller room.Just not great service from Hilton...","Cleveland, Ohio","Lissa F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cleveland, Ohio</strong>",5,3.0

The Hotel DOES NOT offer roll away beds. Our room had two large double beds which were small and a desk with a chair. There is no carpeting so it feels cold and awkward and does not feel inviting in any way. We asked for extra pillows and blankets and got sheets after our first night, the next day after we called again (we stayed two nights.) It is not the typical welcoming feeling of a Homewood suite and that is that. The breakfast was okay. Very typically hectic and busy but fine. The hotel is fine.

Not going back and not impressed. The lack of any other sitting area in the room other than sitting on a bed or an uncomfortable office chair and the fact that there is no carpeting in the rooms made it uncomfortable. The kitchenette was VERY small and don't plan on cooking anything other than using the microwave for a mac and cheese.

I had to put in 3 reminders to the front desk and waited for a good 1 1/2 hour in the night before somebody found the time to come up and help me. This was despite being promised that help is right on its way....Also when I was checking out, the guy at the front desk seemed disinterested in knowing how my stay was ( I booked the room for a good 6 night stay)...So much for basic courtesy to a guest !!Still a positive experience overall!!Thx ","Mumbai, India","VJ_0280</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mumbai, India</strong>",10,4.0

After a very long flight I was greeted at reception by Pranay who provided a big smile and a genuine welcome. I cannot speak highly enough of the way Pranay set the positive tone for my stay. The staff at some of the New York stores (eg Kate Spade) could learn a lot by sitting in the reception area at this hotel and seeing how Pranay and his colleagues interact and relate to their customers. The room was spotless and housekeeping continued to do an outstanding job. The breakfast area is very busy and, whilst the range is not extensive, it is still of good quality and once again the breakfast staff with Jackson do a great job. The downstairs hotel common area, breakfast area and my room seemed to have recently been renovated so everything is very contemporary and clean. My room had a very good sized balcony area which is “bare bones” with a café style table, 4 chairs and a few pavers – with a little more expenditure in paving the whole area and putting in some plant boxes this balcony could become a very nice area and really set this hotel apart. The hotel is well located and a reasonably easy walking distance (with suitcase) from Penn station.

Traveling with three adults and two children with nine bags made us unlikely to be favorites among staff at any facility, but every staff member acted as if we were favorite family members. I would especially like to compliment the employees at the breakfast rooms. In a 22 story hotel the free breakfast accommodating many, many cultural differences and expectations would be really hard. But, they were so very friendly and happy to make sure each and every person had what they needed and began their day on a positive note. WELL DONE. The young women who checked our bags on our last day not only did not flinch at the special attention needed by the back packs of young girls ( American Girl dolls’ heads sticking out so that new hairdos would be preserved) they assured the girls that the dolls would receive special attention.

This room was perfect. Two double beds and a sofa bed meant that there was no arguing over sleeping arrangements. The room was fitted with a small kitchenette including a large fridge\freezer. Breakfast was plentiful and adequate. Its a free breakfast but the choice is OK. Don't expect too much but there's enough to choose from to suit most tastes. Tea and coffee was available in reception 24/7 which was very welcomed. Why cant more places do that? On check in my daughter sneezed and the helpful man immediately handed her a box of tissues. A small thing but a welcoming gesture appreciated on arrival. As you'd expect in New York there is so much to see and do that we didn't spend hours on end in the hotel but it was comforting to know that had we needed to spend more time there than all our needs would have been catered for, Highly recommend this hotel for families and couples.","Birmingham, United Kingdom","MrBlue38</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

We cannot use the toaster due to cross contamination. It has most of the usual utensils (no spatula this time). There is not much room to store groceries so that gets tricky.The breakfast provided by the hotel is hit or miss. We had an EXCELLENT experience on March 26, 2019 when Paul and Jackson were working. Paul was so accommodating about informing about they type of gf bread (Udi’s) and making sure it was not cross contaminated. Jackson checked up to make sure my son liked it which made him feel included. Normally, we don’t risk it because people don’t pay attention. The rest of the days were just ok... We tried again for the toast and the staff for that day did not take the allergy seriously at all. One day the signs labeling the hot food items did not match - bacon was a sausage broccoli mixture, the egg patty was a undercooked French toast bake, etc. The hot beverage bar is always available with office style coffee, tea, and hot cocoa packets. There are always a few pieces of fruit available to grab which we love!The room is nice with a desk, dresser, bed, pullout bed, and wardrobe. It’s NYC so everything is smaller but it works out great!

I chose this hotel because it was the most reasonable rate for the kind of room we needed, and boy was I surprised! We arrived on Friday around 6 pm and were greeted by the kindest, friendliest man at check-in (I’m sorry I don’t remember his name!). Check-in took less than 4 minutes, he apologized about our room being on a lower floor but that’s nothing he could control. We booked a one bedroom king suite and I was pleased with the size of this room! Huge, especially for NYC. Spotlessly clean, nicely decorated, and well situated. There’s a large living room area with a double pull out couch and TV, a separate bedroom with king bed and TV, decent closet and storage space, small kitchenette with large fridge and freezer, sink, cooktop, microwave, dishwasher, toaster, small coffeemaker, and basic cooking necessities (pots,pans, silverware, plates, bowls, glasses, mugs, etc.) Would be great for families staying for extended vacations as you could save a good bit of money by preparing meals in the room. Large windows with blackout shades overlooking the street in the bedroom and sitting room. There’s a safe in the room also. Bathroom is HUMONGOUS. Large sink area with plenty of space to store your toiletries, plenty of towels, hairdryer and a standard sized walk-in shower. Again, spotlessly clean. Neutrogena soap, shampoo, conditioner and lotion are all provided. The girls thought the pullout bed was comfortable enough and the king bed was super comfy. My suggestion would be to add a few more pillows for the pullout. There was only one with the sheet/blanket set. The lobby is beautiful with a fireplace, 24 hour coffee,tea, hot water, creamer, flavored creamers, etc. Coffee is quite good. Breakfast is a nice touch. There are plenty of options to choose from: scrambled eggs, turkey sausage, French toast, potatoes, oatmeal, cereals, yogurt, fresh fruit, all kinds of breads, bagels, and pastries. The employees keep everything replenished and clean. There’s also a rooftop observation deck, business center, laundry and free WiFi. I couldn’t figure out where the self-parking area is, I was on a time crunch, and it was rush hour so I just parked in a small valet garage down the street instead of taking another 30 minute drive around the block.I come to NYC about once a month and I’m happy to say I’ve found my new go-to hotel in the area. 12 minute walk to Broadway theatres and Times Square.

We stayed several nights and the staff was unfailingly friendly and helpful. Our experience in that regard was well above average. The Hilton brand is well represented here. The quality of accommodations is good and includes a buffet breakfast bar. Food was OK but not on par with Hilton's very best offerings. The rooms are not spacious, but they are clean and comfortable. We liked having a kitchenette including full size fridge, sink, small stove top, and, a dishwasher in the room. Bathrooms have ample space and include a walk-in shower. Bedding was just right. Heating and air worked well. WiFi was excellent although users are forced to log on to the network multiple times per day- perhaps for better security. Elevators are busy and require a room key to get to any floor except the lobby level. That can slow down the process and has almost no security benefit but overall ride times were not excessive. The TV was flat screen with a large number of channels. Some channels suffered from buffering due we assume to network issues and one channel had voice over for the visually impaired that could not be muted. There is a small laundry on site where guests can wash and dry their clothes for $2.50 per load. They need a clothes rack for hanging up wrinkle free garments. There is a folding table. The fitness center is very nice.We enjoyed being centrally located in the garment district, not far from Times Square, the theater district, Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. With The Port Authority terminal and multiple subway stations nearby we found getting around the city pretty easy. There are Uber, Lyft and taxi rides for portal to portal travel although we like Dial 7 car service which is about as cheap or cheaper depending on the time of day, and, more reliably available.. There is a Brooklyn Fare grocery store close by as well as both Duane Reade and CVS pharmacies. Several banks have walk-in locations within a short walk. CityMD, a walk-in clinic, faces 8th Av between 33rd and 34th St, within easy walking distance. There are lots of restaurants nearby. We found the most visitor friendly place was the Essen Slow Fast Food restaurant on 8th Av and 36th St where you serve yourself buffet style just the kinds and amounts of food you want, then pay by the pound ($10.99). Their selection of freshly prepared food was impressive. They have a some seating but we usually brought our food back to the room as Essen was only a short walk away from the hotel.

Laundry room very convenient and free coffee, tea and hot chocolate available 24/7 in the foyer is a nice touch.

The Homewood Suites fit the bill perfectly. Our room was quite large and easily accommodated two queen size beds and our luggage. We did not feel cramped in the least. It also had an efficient, well stocked kitchen. The service was also excellent. Nicolas reached out to us via text shortly after our arrival to check our satisfaction with the room. We did express our concerns regarding the room's location which was directly across from the elevator. Nicholas was very understanding and offered to find another room for us if the noise level was unsatisfactory. Stephanie followed up with us the next morning to see how things went. As it turned out, our concerns were unfounded. Noise from the elevator or the accompanying traffic was non existent. A word of caution though. Our room did have a door to an adjacent connecting room. Through the door, we could clearly hear the occupants next door conversing in normal volume voices. This could have been an issue if the conversations continued late into the evening or were raucous. Fortunately for us, that was not the case. The location of this property was also excellent.

Even Mike the post man come odd job man. Thank you all so much, You all made our time there feel so at home. So helpful, friendly and they all had a bubbly sense of humour. Nothing was too much trouble. The hotel roof top was such a lovely place to sit and chill out with a drink. What a view. Our apartment was always so clean and restocked with toiletries and linen. The apartments were so well equipped, the laundry room was such a good asset and very cheap. The hot breakfast was perfect, as it gave us a good early start to the day and enabled us to save time and money by not stopping for lunch. The hot free tea/coffee and chocolate in the foyer to enjoy after a full day or evening out was such a lovely gesture too. This hotel may only be a 3* but it should be a 4* plus. It may not have been the poshest hotel that we have ever stayed in, but it was by far the nicest and one of the cleanest. Most certainly the best staff we have ever had.

FROZEN on Broadway and a Night at the Homewood Suites in Manhattan. Times Square South. They had an excellent time. They can't stop raving about it. From the time they arrived at the Front Desk to the time they departed they said all of the staff they met were so welcoming / warm / kind. The first person they met at the front Desk was Nicole. The room wasn't ready yet so Nicole took my mom's cell phone # and texted her once the room was ready. When they arrived back to the hotel, Nicole gave them a big welcome back, a Happy Anniversary and two bottles of complimentary water.When they got up to their room on the 15th floor there was a bottle of sparkling cider / popcorn / Hershey Kisses waiting for them in their room with a note. "" True Love is Spending one Day getting married and the rest of your life feeling glad you did."" When they texted me thanking me for the items in the room I said ""I wasn't aware there was anything specific / special in the room"" I believe the staff of the hotel put those items together for their arrival which was very kind / unexpected. The room itself was a good size for them. It was a King Studio Efficiency suite. I was worried it was going to be to small for them but they said it was the perfect size. Their room didn't have a spectacular view just views of other buildings / roof tops / etc... However when they went up to the 22nd floor they were able to see part of the Hudson River and other landmarks; they couldn't stop talking about the views from the roof. Breakfast: They did eat breakfast at the hotel. I believe they said it was busy so they had to wait a little bit until a table opened up. They also mentioned that the food could have been a little warmer but overall the food was good and definitely did not complain about a Complimentary Breakfast which I believe is not standard in a lot of hotels in bigger cities. Overall they give the hotel and their stay a 10/10. If they or anyone in our family / friends need a place to stay in NYC we will definitely recommend this hotel.

The staff was very courteous, friendly and always eager to help. They greeted us by name and pleasant smiles whenever we walked by in the lobby. Speaking of the lobby, it was very clean and attractive, as were all areas of the hotel, even the elevators and stairwells. We originally booked a king suite with sofa bed. We were waiting for an upgrade to two queen beds but decided to stick with our original room because it was ready on arrival whereas the double queen wasn't available yet and we had to get over to Comic-Con. Our room was nice and clean and spacious enough to accommodate our party of two parents and two teens. The room was equipped with a full kitchen which included a sink, dishwasher, stove/oven, refrigerator, microwave and coffee maker. Although the stove and refrigerator aren't full size, they're not mini and are sufficiently large enough for the majority of guests. There were also cooking utensils, dishes and cutlery. As far as amenities it felt more like staying in a timeshare room than a hotel suite. The king bed was comfortable but the twin sofa sleeper was very uncomfortable. The mattress was very thin and hard as a rock. Thankfully, I was the only one who had to suffer sleeping on it as my wife and two daughters slept in the king bed. The room also had a desk, very nice 55-inch LED television and a balcony overlooking 37th Street. Our room was generally quiet but we did clearly hear housekeeping and a few guests in the hallway on a few occasions. The hotel serves hot breakfast each morning but it's pretty bland and generic. If you just want some food for energy to get started, it's fine but if you go expecting a nice steaming hot delicious breakfast, you may want to catch one of the nearby restaurants instead. The hotel is within walking distance of the Javits Center and Times Square which are both are several blocks away. Penn Station is also nearby and was very convenient for traveling to Citi-Field in Brooklyn for the concert. Thanks to the close proximity to Times Square, the Javits Center and Penn Station, the Times Square Homewood Suites is about as centrally located as it gets. It's also a short ride to and from the Lincoln Tunnel. We really enjoyed our stay at the Times Square Homewood Suites and send thanks to the front desk staff for being so polite, helpful and courteous during our stay.

This trip there was one exception. We were moving our daughter into college, so we chose this location due to its proximity to Macy’s, Kmart, Duane Reed & Target & we also appreciated the courteous front desk associates receiving packages for us.The evening of 8/21/18 we returned to our hotel at 11pm. I was waiting for a package & my husband & daughter headed up to our room. Once I had the box, I proceeded to the elevator. A man who appeared to be homeless was waiting for the elevator. He waited for a car to close & when I pushed the button up, he wanted to follow me into the next empty elevator. I declined & said I forgot I had some laundry in the basement. Then he pressed the down button and when I tried to get in, he attempted to follow me, so I actually pushed passed him & approached the front desk. He stayed by the elevators. Several landed & he wasn’t getting in. When the front desk woman (I didn’t get her name but it appeared that next to her a shift change was happening where another clerk was leaving and a man was coming in)...anyway, she asked how she could help me and I said that I was just waiting for that man to get in his own elevator. She laughed and said “oh he’s harmless. I mean, he’s homeless but he’s harmless. His family pays for him to stay here. He’s been here for three months.” She said it loud enough for him to hear...I didn’t want to lodge a complaint, I just wanted to feel safe. She walked away, making me feel even more uncomfortable.I tried to call my husband, but he had his phone on silent. I lingered in the lobby until he eventually got on his own car.This behavior is not acceptable. We live in Orlando. I actually founded a charity in 2012 for homeless school children.

The only reason I didn’t rate the hotel 5 Stars was the glass shower door was missing the stripping at the bottom, so there was major leaks every time we showered and did not ever see maintenance come by to fix it even though we notified them.

Both lived up to expectations. When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a friendly staff. I knew my room was not ready because I used the digital key option but I was given the opportunity to store my luggage and start my journey around the city. When I returned later in the afternoon my room was still not ready but was offered the same corner room one floor lower. It was perfect. I was given room 1601. It was a 1 KING BED PREMIUM EFF CLEAN AIR STUDIO. I was met with a variety of complimentary beverages and snacks in room and fridge. The room had a full-size fridge, a two burner electric stove, a dishwasher, a full complement of kitchen supplies. This room was ideal for the traveler who is staying an extended time in the city and wanted to prepare his/her meals. Due to an early flight home, I was only able to advantage of their breakfast selection. It is the standard breakfast selection you find at most if not all Hiltons that offer a free breakfast, which I find is more than adequate to start your day. This one had a nice selection of food and a good size dining room. Location-This hotel is easy to find on W. 37th Street and 8th Avenue. You can easily see the sign from the corner and is extremely helpful if you forget which street it is on. It is only 3-4 blocks from Madison Square Garden. I was lucky enough to purchase tickets to two nights of the Radiohead concert in NYC and this hotel was ideal for it. It was so nice to be able to leave for the concert and be there. I didn't have to take the subway or a taxi. When it comes to the subway, this hotel is ideally located within walking distance of the majority of NYC's subway lines. Rooftop terrace- After the first concert I decided to utilize the terrace offered. It was ideal after a long day and night in the city. Located on the 22nd floor, I was given the opportunity to relax high above all the noise of the city. The cool breeze of the evening made for a perfect night with a really nice view of the city's skyline. Overall- Many hotel rooms in NYC can be quite small, but this one was ideal. It was perfect for my needs and well worth every Hilton Honors Point.","Erath, Louisiana","609seand</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Erath, Louisiana</strong>",11,5.0

The FO guy was ok, not too friendly but not rude either, just ok.Around 1.30PM the kids start become cranky so I approach FO staff again to asked whether the room is ready. This time I served by Tiara; FO staff and she is very very helpful and friendly. After checking in the system she apologized and said that the room still in cleaning progress and she will informed me once it's ready and it's should not be long.So I wait again then after 5-10min I saw that she was looking for us then she walked to us and said this is your room key as i promised 15min ago. I was very happy and thanked her for her quick actionMy reservation was divided into 2 reservation as I can't book 1 room straight for 4nights. For this issue she also very helpful and check every morning to see whether I can stay in the same room for the whole 4nightsThe third day in the morning I met her again and she sorry that apparently room is fully booked so I had to change room but she asked me to pack everything and leave our 5big luggages and 3cabin luggages in the room. She'll asked porter to move all of them to the new roomSo when we back to the room around 4PM I collect the new key; served by Junior; FO staff. He was also very helpful during our stay. We went to the new room and all my 8 luggages already in the new room without any drama.The 2 rooms category that I stay is excellent. Quite spacious and clean. It's not luxury but more that adequate for family to stay for more that 1-2 weeks. Homewood suites is not a luxury hotel but also not a basic apartment hotel. It's a normal hotel but its room is more like a small apartment; spacious and equipped with kitchen, full size fridge, microwave etc. They also have big laundromat room in the basementLocation is perfect. It's not in the middle of Times Square but only 10-15min walk to TS. It's surrounded by many restaurants and pizza counter. So food is not an issue.  Overall I very recommend this hotel for family.

The hotel location was amazing on a quiet street between Time Square and Maddison Square Garden, close to a subway station and within walking distance of so many attractions, shops, bars and restaurants. The room was fabulous, so well equipped, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The reception has a 24 hour coffee station which meant we did not use the facilities in the room which included a fridge freezer, hob and microwave! Breakfast was amazing! Before traveling, we had read reviews saying it was crowded and busy - we easily found a table every morning and found breakfast a relaxed experience. Delicious food, which was different each morning with an amazing choice to suit even the fussiest traveller. On our last morning we took coffee and cake up to the 22nd floor roof terrace, which was a really tranquil spot above all the hustle and bustle below. We spent a relaxing hour up there and loved it. As I said the staff are amazing - as 1st timers we had lots of questions for the concierge - who from start to finish was so helpful. The reception staff wishes you a good day as you left and a warm welcome back every time - usually a friendly wave as we came and went.We cannot recommend this hotel enough and are hoping to return in September.

Our room was very clean, it didn't have everything it was supposed to have, as far as, the extra snacks I'd paid for but they were sent right up. Coffee was only decaf, never refilled with regular. This is minor. Poor cell phone and internet reception required us to move to another room. Service was better but not great. Seemed to be consistent no matter what part of the hotel we were in.

He came in multiple times, helped himself to the coffee and tea and would ride the elevator upstairs and disappear for a while.

This time I wanted a suite and was so pleased that I chose here. Had 2 x 1 bedroom premium suites which came with snacks and sodas every day. Larger than ave rooms, good size bathroom. Sofa and table useful for takeouts. Microwave and full size fridge is great. Great location and could not hear any sound from the street which is rare in NYC. Staff were amazing. 7 Eleven at the end of the block where you get snacks, beverages, beer, pizza slices etc. Omy on front desk made our stay perfect. From ordering dinner for us from our fav local restaurant to making sure we had water for the journey to JFK and the anniversary card and bottle form the hotel. The hot breakfast every day was great and real good choice-and rare in Manhattan.The grab and go breakfast every day was great for early starts. Short Walking distance to Time square, Penn st, Macy’s etc and 2 4 min walk to 34th street subway. Highly recommend and will be staying here all the time going forward.

Convenient, quiet, safe location. Just a short walk to so many choices of things to see, do or eat. I was especially interested in it's location in the garment district. As a Project Runway fan, the fact that we were only about 2 blocks from Mood Fabrics, it was like a visit to Disney for some! Our room was adequate for 3. (Unfortunately there were 4 of us. More on that in a minute.) It was very nice to have a small kitchenette with fridge, microwave, stovetop, sink and accompanying utensils. Everything was well done including a pretty extensive included morning breakfast. There is also an area with tables in the lobby with 24 hr coffee, hot chocolate and a fireplace. Now to the Nightmare. My friend booked this hotel via Expedia. At first, there were 3 of us going. Then we needed to add a fourth person. She called Expedia and was able to re-book to a larger room that was to sleep 4. She paid the resulting increase and thought all was well. Until we arrived at the hotel. Expedia had supposedly re-booked us 4 into this hotel in a room configuration that we now found does not even exist in the hotel. Our room had beds for 3, NOT 4. The staff was very gracious in trying to help us through this nightmare while we spent THREE HOURS on the phone with Expedia trying to work this out. It was Spring Break week and besides the room for 3 that we were booked into, there was only 1 other unsold room in the hotel, a King. Expedia refused to help us in the only reasonable way, by paying for the King for us as well. They promised and charged us for a room that slept 4. They even called and spoke to the hotel staff about their booking error and confirmed that the configuration that we were sold did not exist in this hotel. They ultimately refused to pay for the second room and grudingly refunded the upcharge from our 3 person to 4 person reservation. This seriously took the first 3 hours of our short 2 day trip to NYC. All throughout our phone ordeal with Expedia, the hotel staff was gracious, helpful and empathetic to our situation. They could not change or comp our room situation since the error was on Expedia's part. They ultimately provided an air mattress to accommodate the necessity to sleep 4 in the original room. It was a very tight squeeze. But luckily, the 4 of us are the best of friends. Shame on Expedia, but Kudos to Homewood Suites Midtown. They helped us make the best of what was a rotten start to our trip. We had a wonderful trip and we'd definitely stay there again.","keystone heights, fl","gtrtravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>keystone heights, fl</strong>",67,5.0

I’ve been there many times, and I’ve stayed in many hotels. Everything from The Marriott Marquis to the Club Quarter brands. I’ve loved each and every hotel, but this was a shocker. I walked in to check in, and was greeted by wonderful people. They were chatty and helpful. They got me into a room, which was supposed to be a Queen and Sofa bed. I went up the elevator and to the room. I opened the door to see two double beds and a sofa bed, more than I asked for. The room was huge, even by outside of NYC standards. It was clean and smelled wonderful. The kitchenette would be great for a longer stay. The bathroom had so much more room than any other hotel. The ceiling fan was a wonderful addition as well. Never would I think New York had a gem like this. We also got to get a later check out, without charge. Didn’t see the breakfast, as we slept a bit late and we just ordered from my favorite diner. Checkout was quick and they made sure we wanted to charge we had, for drinks, to go to the account. My only complaint is I can’t find a room with this many beds for October.

It’s functional, and is a good base if you’re looking to be close to the heart of Manhattan without being right in the thick of it. Let’s talk pros and cons.Cons: 1) Water pressure is awful. While I applaud being eco friendly and am all for water conservation, of t did make for a difficult shower.2) Breakfast. This actually surprised me a bit because usually the Hilton family nails it on breakfast. I got sick my first afternoon there after eating the breakfast so I didn’t go back. The sausage tasted weird, and the egg “omelette” with a kraft single in the middle wasn’t appetizing. If I was F&B, I’d shoot for a little better ingredients. My suggestion: skip breakfast and go to Brooklyn Bagel and Coffee down the street.The pros: 1) Check in process. Service is friendly and efficient. I think the entire check in process took three minutes, if that. Nick helped us at check in, and Michael V. totally saved me when I needed a late night florist at midnight.2) Location. HWS is tucked down a side street and is easily accessible to Times Square and all subway lines. Overall, I would return again.

You can even eat your take away in the lobby area or take your food up to the roof terrace. It was unusually cold for NY in April when we visited but we did go up to the roof terrace. It was a lovely place to sit outdoors in a very busy area of the city. The self service hot drinks in the lobby were fantastic. The inclusive buffet breakfast was good but crowded (as other reviewers mentioned). It was useful that they didn’t mind you taking it up to your room. I loved the delicious little bagels. We did happen to be in the lobby one afternoon and had a couple of the complimentary cookies which were tasty. There were greedy guests sitting in the lobby with their takeaway food who grabbed all the cookies every time they were brought out, but that’s not the hotel’s fault. The room and bathroom were very clean and the shower was good. My only gripe is that they provide soap bars instead of shower gel, which I prefer. The hotel is walking distance to many sights including Times Square. The subway is easily reached at Penn Station (which is only a few blocks away). We didn’t get a chance to use the gym as hoped but it had a good selection of equipment and was very clean.

The room is NOT a ""traditional"" suite (with a bedroom separate from a living room) however was perfect for my daughter and me. I read extensive reviews about the hotel and set my expectations but was pleasantly surprised with the hotel and would definitely stay here again!GREAT SERVICE - We arrived in the city on Monday morning and were extremely lucky as we were allowed to check in early to our room. We found the front desk clerks to be very friendly and professional throughout our stay - always greeting us when we walked into the lobby and very helpful with directions, etc.HOT BREAKFAST - I read reviews about the breakfast area getting crowded, however since I filled a few plates and took the food back to eat in our room this was not an issue for me. Suggest getting an early start to beat the crowds - we also slept in most of the trip so only made it to the hot breakfast twice during our stay.ADEQUATE ELEVATORS - I read reviews about the long elevator wait times however again, we lucked out and got a room on the third floor. I was prepared to take the stairs in the event the elevator wait was too long however since we never had an issue with waiting we never took the stairs during our stay. NO SOUND ISSUES - Our room was located right behind the elevators (room 306). I had concerns about possible noise from the elevator mechanism and foot traffic but did not experience any problems. Our room was towards the back of the hotel (facing office buildings) so we did not experience significant street noise (however we are very heavy sleepers so snooze through anything!).HOTEL AMENITIES - We used the printer in the business center a few times and did a load of laundry as well. We used the gym once during our stay and found the equipment perfectly acceptable (but we admittedly are NOT ""gym rats"" so unqualified to opine on this subject). I am a coffee fanatic, so absolutely LOVED the coffee/tea/hot cocoa station set up in the lobby 24/7! The room also had a coffee maker so I was well caffeinated! We are Hilton Honors members so had free wi-fi in the room, which was also a great perk.ROOFTOP LOUNGE - The rooftop area is really nice to get some fresh air and probably lovely during the warmer months. It snowed during our stay so my daughter and I had a snowball fight and she made snow angels on the rooftop lounge!OK NEIGHBORHOOD - For the most part we felt safe but it is New York City so there will be ""characters"" on the streets late at night. It didn't bother us however if you are very sensitive to homeless people, then I'd suggest taking an Uber or taxi back to the hotel if returning after 9pm. Before that, there is enough ""legitimate"" foot traffic from the neighboring businesses, restaurants and stores.CONVENIENT LOCATION - We were able to walk to so many locations: Highline/Chelsea, Bryant Park, Times Square, Broadway, Midtown/5th Avenue. The hotel is very close to major subway stations (Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens) so we found it to be a very central location. There's a Dunkin Donuts, 7-Eleven and 2 Bros Pizza located closeby if you are hit with a late night snack attack.SMALL GRIPES - The dishwasher is pretty noisy; don't plan to run it right before bedtime. There is a small setup near the front desk selling toiletries, detergent, snacks, etc. however the prices are high (you're paying for convenience!).In summary, a fantastic trip and GREAT hotel! Don't expect the Taj Mahal or fancy-schmancy services since IS a limited service hotel. However I found it to be a great value so we could splurge on other fun things while in New York. We had an amazing vacation and this hotel was a wonderful ""home base"" for us.","Honolulu, Hawaii","K808_coffee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",2,5.0

The shower door had a slight gap and water leaked all over floor, so we used the bath towel toabsorb the excess water. The fridge was a tad noisy but with earplugs, it wasn’t an issue. We loved having a ceiling fan! Our room was away from street and very quiet except for the next door guests’ constant door slamming, which I did directly and politely address - this isn’t the hotel’s fault, but I’ve seen other hotels with signs asking guests to softly close their doors. Perhaps this would be a good solution for people who need a gentle reminder :). Fortunately these folks did quiet down after I asked them. Unlike other reviews complaining about the slow elevators, the lifts were not a problem on the 12th floor. I’m not sure why, but Housekeeping consistently stored their cart outside our room overnight.Breakfast was meh. The “Hot” food was usually cold (3 days in a row, even at 7:30) and the cut up fruit didn’t taste very fresh. If patrons expect a hot breakfast, my recommendation would be to stick with the hotel’s yogurt, cereal and other similar provided fare, or find a nearby diner with cooked to order food. The staff at breakfast were very genial. Guests may want to dine on the early side as the breakfast area gets crowded and tables are a premium. The Homewood Suites is in a great location and has good rates for Manhattan. We were able to walk to many sites including Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and the High Line at Hudson Yards.

Typically I love Homewood Suites because they have a separate room I where I can close the door and let my child go to sleep around 7pm. Then I can stay up later and watch a movie. Even though I booked the ""king bed studio suite"" there was no door separation to the living area. I was told 'studio' implies a single room. I'm not a linguist but the whole reason I booked a room in an all suite hotel was to I could have a separation between the bedroom and the living space. Combined with the following many small issues, the experience was the WORST for any Homewood Suite I've ever stayed in.- The refrigerator made a crazy high pitched noise so no one could sleep. The hotel's solution the following day? Unplug it. Great, thanks now my child's milk is spoiled. (Not kidding.)- The restroom next to the gym is absolutely foul with no working fans.- Soap, but no sponges to wash dishes. - Cleaning staff did not replace towels repeatedly. - Overall the breakfast was far lacking compared to other Homewood Suites I've stayed in. Breakfast egg omelette was filled with what seemed to be nacho cheese. All in all this particular Homewood Suites experience was what I would expect from a two star hotel, and not a Hilton branded property.

It is always a challenge to find a hotel that is friendly, clean, convenient, and reasonable. Yet Homewood managed to be all this and more. We booked two rooms for a long weekend stay and we couldn't be happier. First of all, the location is fantastic, just two blocks from the 35th st. subway stop and easy walk to the heart of Times Square yet tucked far enough that it is not chaotic. We arrived at 2 pm intending to just drop off our bags and were pleasantly surprised to be told that one of our rooms was already available. Our rooms were immaculate, compact but very complete. Everything is so modern, love the frameless shower doors! So nice to have a full-size fridge and mini-kitchen, which meant we had a place to store the goodies we were buying from all over the city! The breakfast is delicious, and served in their spacious lobby dining area using real plates and silverware! :-) Lots of nearby restaurants and shopping. Best part of this hotel is the staff, no matter what time of day there are at least 3-4 staff members behind the desk who are nice and cheerful and willing to help in every way. There is rarely a long line to check-in or out because someone else jumps in whenever it gets busy. Our search for the perfect NYC hotel is over.

My room was a king efficiency that had a large mini fridge with freezer, stove top, microwave & mini-dishwasher. The bathroom was a little too small for my preference as there was hardly any counter space & the shower stall was small as well. I slept extremely well both nights. I loved the ceiling fan!

This was based on the kitchen in the room (our son is a fussy eater), the included breakfast, the location and good reviews.Check-in was straightforward. We had asked for a room on a high floor away from the elevators and were given a room on the 17th floor (of 22) but surprised to find it was close to the elevators. However, this wasn’t a problem and we didn’t experience any noise whatsoever with the exception of a noisy neighbour on the first night. In fact being at the rear of the hotel meant it was a very quiet room.The room was very clean with a wood floor, comfortable king size bed and foldaway bed. It had a high ceiling with ceiling fan (3 settings) which we found useful for circulating the air. A good sized Samsung TV and plenty of electrical sockets with one being next to a full length mirror, very handy. A hairdryer is supplied as a well as an ironing board and iron. Also a bedside clock radio. The kitchen consisted of a very large clean microwave oven, a good sized fridge freezer, 2 burner halogen hob, sink and dishwasher. A coffee maker and coffee and tea bags (no kettle). All of the pans, plates, bowls, cutlery etc. was very clean and looked almost new. There was a small bottle of washing up liquid supplied and a detergent sachet for the dishwasher. The only downside with the fridge freezer was that it was quite noisy and being just a few feet from the bed meant we regularly heard it during the night.The bathroom had a tiled floor and was very clean with large shower but no bath which wasn’t a problem for us. Towels supplied were incredibly soft and very welcome and the toiletries were neutrogena.We were early risers for the breakfast buffet and found the choices available suited our needs and set us up for the days sightseeing. It included a choice of hot turkey patty, scrambled eggs and potato. Toast, bagels, fresh fruit salad, yoghurts, fruit and muffins/cookies as well as juice drinks and tea & coffee. In fact you could help yourself to tea and coffee all day and was a real plus. For those who like to keep on eye on the news/sport, there is a wall of 4 large tv screens where you can sit for breakfast or anytime during the day. Don’t miss the cookies available in the afternoons, they are delicious.Times Square is a short distance away but it was great to be just out of the hustle and bustle and sometimes a relief to get back to the hotel and out of the busy hoards! There is a handy 7-11 store a few doors away on the corner of 37th and 8th, Dunkin Donuts as well as “2 Bros Pizza” where you could buy a basic margherita pizza slice for $1 (or better choice of flavours for more $) and a wok to walk are nearby. We had planned to use the gym but simply didn’t find the time. It did however look well equipped. We found the small business room was useful for checking in online for our flight home and printing boarding passes.Check out is 12 midday but the hotel will store your luggage for you if you have a later flight.Overall, a good hotel. Generally, the staff were friendly particularly the tall lady in the breakfast room (we didn’t catch her name) and the maintenance guy in the light grey jacket. The only sour point being the rather cold and unfriendly lady on reception during checkout who made us feel like we were an inconvenience.",Gloucestershire,"Iabud67</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gloucestershire</strong>",41,4.0

The biggest let down was the cleaning staff who repeatedly failed to clean our rooms and when we returned from a day of activities to clean up for dinner, we found our rooms still not cleaned. Then the cleaner would knock on the door to tell us she was finishing her shift and if we wanted our rooms cleaned we need to pay her to work overtime. We reported this to management but nothing changed. And we also had a bad experience with the security deposit the hotel holds on checking in. This was not released by the hotel until over 1 month following our stay, and not after multiple international phone calls chasing it. They explained that it can take some time for money to be released with overseas credit cards, but funnily every other hotel we stayed in on the trip managed to release the funds within about 48 hours of check out.

They claimed to have offered me compensation, but that was actually credit card discount extended by the bank. I was supposed to be in a twin room, but they didn’t bother to put me back on a similar room type, claiming that there’s a sofa bed. Yes, there was a sofa bed that was squeaking with the slightest movement and mattress so thin, sleeping on it for 8 nights just ain’t comfortable. If I were to upgrade to a twin room, I had to top up $50 per night, which Agoda didn’t compensate. There are only very few hotels with kitchenette near Times Square, so I was left with limited choice.Think twice before you book on Agoda, they’re slow, inefficient, insincere. My booking was cancelled days before the check-in date when I was already in US, which left me in distress.

The location was perfect; the rooms are large by NYC standards and came equipped with a large screen tv, a full size refrigerator, microwave and should I have needed it - a two burner stovetop. The coffee bar was well stocked with coffee and tea. I liked the wood flooring as opposed to carpet because it is cleaner; the bathroom had class doors which is so much nicer than curtains. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the heating/cooling worked perfectly unlike some hotels where I'm either always cold or hot. There was a very nice desk, which I chose to use as a vanity so as not to take up the bathroom while my husband showered. My only complaint is that there is no where to put your personal toiletries in the bathroom ... there is literally no counter space and the cupboards under the sink held towels and the hairdryer. I cleaned them out - stuffed the towels into one cubby and used the rest for my things. I wall towel rack would eliminate this and allow the shelving to be used for personal items. The lobby is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a fireplace which was great as we were there during the 'great freeze' and they provide complimentary hot chocolate, coffee and tea. The buffet breakfast was quite limited - no Danish or pastries and the eggs were tiny squares of very dry egg; there was no bacon - it was really not very appealing but for those in a hurry - it served its purpose.

However, it's not as good as last time. We were there from late December to mid January and clearly the hotel couldn't cope with it being full. The difference over that time was huge.- Getting to breakfast at 10.15 was a huge mistake as the food was basically almost all gone and not replenished even though service was to be until 10.30. Don't even thing about trying to find a seat in the dining room- there are 3 lifts for all guests plus staff. One day it took me 15 minutes to get to the ground floor whilst I waited for a lift that stopped and/or wasn't full- the lobby area looked like a train station waiting room, and at breakfast it was full of people eating and the dining area was full.Once the hoards had left it was much easier to get to breakfast, have use of lifts and general amenities. However, other things have changed e.g. no buffet dinner included but daily rate hasn't changed and facilities in the room such as toilet paper and tea/coffee are the cheapest on the market. And please fix the room doors - they all self close with a slam and I got tired of being woken by slamming doors (especially the store room doors).When you are paying this much per night I expect better.Having said all of this, the location is still great and the rooms are very comfortable but I'd avoid peak times to stay again.","Melbourne, Australia","smacka21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",54,3.0

We had found a great weekend special. The hotel is 22 stories tall and has about 15 rooms per floor. It is a short distance to Penn Station and Times Square. The rooms are very modern and utilitarian, but designed with all the essentials. There is a small kitchen unit with two burners, microwave, dishwasher, and refrigerator. The room had a king size bed, a small couch, a desk, and a closet. It was quiet. The hotel appears busy with a quick turnover of patrons. The bathroom was clean, but had a somewhat well used look. Breakfast was included with the price of the room. It was buffet style and more than adequate. We were there at 6 AM, so there was no line and plenty of food. The only complaint was that the food in the chaffing dishes was not hot. We stayed at the Homewood Suites during the severe cold. The lobby is not designed for this kind of weather and each time the automatic sliding door opened, there was a blast of very cold air that penetrated through the whole first floor. You really needed a coat if you were going to sit long in the lobby. The key card system was not working and staff had to let us back into our room each time we both went out.

The hotel itself was everything we wanted - the room was sufficiently sized so that we could both easily fit our very large suitcases, with plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe and an all-important full length mirror too. The bathroom and shower were spacious and the room was always impeccably made up when we returned home after a big day of exploring NYC.

Sometimes there were some colourful people hanging around the street near the entrance to the hotel, but they were generally harmless. A great little coffee spot down the road (Madman Espresso) was my husband's first stop of the day, occasionally bringing a takeaway back to the hotel to enjoy with his breakfast, which was also a highlight for me - granola with fresh yoghurt, turkey patties (very foreign to us Australians but very delicious!), 'tater tots' and fruit to go.

So our 2 person room was very uncomfortable.Breakfast was included and the food is not bad but there are simply not enough tables which means you are hanging around for a while waiting to grab a table, This is never too easy when there are 5 of you. They have 3 lifts - you'd think that was enough? You'd be wrong over the 4 days we were there we always squashed into a lift with at least 6 others.

When I made a last minute decision to spend the night in the city following a show, I was happy to see this available again at such an inexpensive rate! ($91AAA). Love the hardwood floors, quiet halls, beautiful lobby and quick and friendly check-in. We requested a higher floor away from the elevator, which were both granted (17th floor, corner room). We had a king sized bed with a single sofa bed that we didn’t utilize this trip. Even though we didn’t use it, we love the little kitchen. Everything was sparkling clean in the bathroom, with a good pressured hot shower to start the day. Appreciated the non-flimsy towels!The closet was of a good size, with a small safe inside. Nice flat screen television and two small tables at either side of the bed with outlets and a small lamp. About a ten minute walk to time square as well as Penn Station. The plentiful free breakfast was ready at 6am, which included scrambled eggs, potatoes and sausages, fruit, various bagels/bread, yogurt and juices. And coffee always available in the lobby.

At first, I was disappointed with my stay at Times Square HWS, but I took them up on their offer and now I am completely satisfied. I am here on business and if you are coming for the same, I recommend that you not ""upgrade"" to a room with a balcony (especially if it is too cold to be outside anyway!). This eats up the space in your room, eliminates the couch + couch table, and blocks your view to outside (the balcony wall is pretty high, and balcony rooms are only on level 8 so you're walled off by neighboring buildings as well). When my fridge started making a high pitched sound in the night, I decided I would go ahead and ask to move . . . SO GLAD I DID! I have a ""downgraded"" room which doesn't include a balcony, but I am on the 16th floor and have a couch and couch table, and a much more open view! Tiara at the front desk made this an easy switch. Junior is another friendly and helpful force up front. Speaking of upfront, the lobby space is fairly large and cozy with a fireplace. It can get REALLY crowded down there at peek times, so it is great that they have a fairly large space. For as big as the hotel is, it is fairly quiet in the halls and rooms. Noise from neighboring guests is fairly minimal. Breakfast has more options that other HWS locations (or Hampton Inns, etc.) but less complimentaries in the rooms. Not a deal breaker, just notable difference within the chain. I would definitely stay here again, and recommend to others as well.","Beverly Hills, California","angieprim27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beverly Hills, California</strong>",7,5.0

The reception staff were efficient and friendly. The room was so clean, i usually take a pack of flash wipes with me to go over the bathroom etc but there was no need here and the room was thoroughly cleaned every day. The buffet breakfast was great and saved us a fortune. The dining hall area does get busy but it is fast moving and we always found a table even if it took a lap of the hall. The breakfast included an egg dish (sometimes scrambled, sometimes omelette), a sausage patty and potato dish. There were a variety of cereals, toast, bagels, fruit and pastries. The coffee was lovely and i really love the coffee mate creamer (we don't have that variety in the UK and i wished we did). The location is just off 8th Ave, probably not the most desirable end of town but we didn't have any issues and the streets were so busy we didn't ever feel vulnerable. You are also near to a Starbucks, 7-11 and a Dunkin Donuts so plenty of places to grab a snack. I think the walk to Times Square took about 15-20 mins.On our last day Reception ordered our car back to the airport and he was reasonable and on time. We stayed in the reception area drinking coffee and watching the TV by the fire, it was so relaxing.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel especially if you are a family and i hope to return soon.","London, United Kingdom","Jools1000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",10,5.0

The person who decided to put a refrigerator/freezer about 4.5 feet from the head of the bed should be fired immediately. I requested a room where the fridge is across the room, as I saw in some pics, but was unable to get one. That was partially offset by getting one of the patio rooms, but I STRONGLY suggest you do not book a room here if you're a light sleeper, and having that right by your ear would keep you up all night long.I think the garment district is a decent part of town to stay in, assuming you realize that from the 30s, getting to the east side isn't overly convenient. I personally enjoy this area, but to each his own. The hotel itself, well, it's a Homewood. You know what you're getting. Functional, but nothing exciting. The rooms did look newly furnished and the lobby was quite clean at all hours. My room, however, had obviously not been swept upon arrival, because I removed my socks before taking a shower, and could feel tons of junk under my feet. Not the best way to start a trip. Also, the washcloth waiting on the sink at arrival was not clean, as it had some form of makeup on it (picture attached.)The patio attached to the room was tremendous though. Perfect October weather for having bagels in the morning and drinks at night on it.

This trip was a tiny bit less satisfying, since it seems someone was in my bathroom before I checked in and left a rather substantial box cutter behind (I searched under the bed and in the closets after I found THAT), and also, every piece of furniture faced AWAY from the TV, which made it really awkward to watch it -- especially with another person. Also, may I just add that you should probably build in extra time for the elevators, since there are only three and there are a LOT of floors and rooms. I was almost late to a meeting waiting for the elevator (and I was on the 19th floor -- the stairs weren't really an option).But all these complaints are so MINOR.

The suites are located smack in the middle of the Garment district. From the moment we arrived at 11.00am, we found the staff to be really helpful and welcoming. Our luggage was stored until a room was available, at which time we were texted. Hot and cold drinks were available in the small but pleasant lobby, as were cookies mid afternoon. We could also have taken advantage of the patio area at lobby level or the roof top patio.We booked a queen suite and asked for a quiet room. I wasn't disappointed. We were on the 5th floor overlooking the street but the noise insulation was so good that I never had a disturbed night for our whole stay. The room itself was absolutely adequate for our needs. Two very comfortable beds, plus a bed settee, a well equipped kitchenette (which we didn't use), and a comfortable bathroom with Neutrogena toiletries. The only disadvantage was the small wardrobe which was located in the bathroom but as we were only there for 4 nights it wasn't an issue for us.The breakfast room was situated adjacent to the lobby and again we found the fare met our needs. Cereals, fresh fruit, yoghurt, muffins, a minimal hot selection, toast, bagels and various toppings for the latter. Again, very friendly support staff, and the area was kept clean.With regards to location, I loved browsing the material shops in the Garment district. It felt safe to walk around during day or evening. We were close to some great mid range restaurants and any number of takeaway outlets, and we were comfortably within walking distance of the lights and noise of times Square and Broadway.All in all, would we stay again? Definitely, and a big thank you to all of the staff-you do a great job and it was a pleasure to meet such friendly folk.","Barnsley, United Kingdom","KaraokeSue7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barnsley, United Kingdom</strong>",123,5.0

With the size of the room it can feel rather claustrophobic. A huge downfall of the room was the air quality, I would compare it to that of a hotel casino. It was awful and extremely hard to breathe, the bathroom reeked of stale cigarette, like it was in the wall. (we were in a NO smoking room btw)The hotel is is a perfect location, with time square only being within blocks, Penn station being maybe two blocks away that can connect to all major subway lines, tons of restaurant and fast grab food places in a close proximity. PERF. location for a tourist that wants to be central to everythingalmost forgot, theres a beautiful roof top terrace that offers awesome views of the city!

The room was very comfortable and easily accommodated my husband, myself and our three boys. Our teenager was quite happy to sleep on the pull out sofa bed. The kitchenette was a nice feature to have in the room. We didn't do any cooking, but there was a full size fridge that we utilized a lot. The only thing that the room was lacking was a dining table. Even just a small table with a couple of chairs would have been helpful. The hotel is in a great location. It is within walking distance to Times Square, Madison Square Gardens and other attractions. Penn Station was only a five minute walk from the hotel so it was easy to access the subway. There are also plenty of restaurants and bars close by. There is also a 7-11 just around the corner, which was convenient for buying drinks and snacks to keep in the room.The rooftop terrace was a nice feature. There is a great view with ample seating and people are allowed to take drinks up there. The complimentary breakfast was also great. The quality of the food wasn't the greatest, but it was decent. We got a great deal for the room and for the price we were paying we more than happy with the food offerings. There was always a choice of a type of egg, sausage and potato in addition to cereals, bagels, oatmeal, pastries and fruit. It was a great way to fuel up in the mornings before going to explore NYC. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would definitely stay here again. It was great value for the price that we paid, which was much lower than other hotels in the area.",,654annaj,0,5.0

We chose to stay in a Hilton chain hotel that is centrally located in NYC. Check in at the hotel was very smooth. We were assigned a room on the 21st floor. The bed was comfortable,the bathroom was rather of modest size, with or enough space to place our toilet articles. Storage space was Insufficient for a 10 day stay. One tiny cupboard and one drawer cabinet. The kitchen corner (in fact, not even a corner but an integral part of the room, with no separation at all from the sleep area) was over-equipped, with everything needed to operate a household kitchen - except for one problem - there was no room to place items next to the sink, and there was no kitchen or dinner table. So we could not really make use of the kitchen and resorted to having lunch and dinning daily in restaurants. This is a faulty design of the kitchen which did not allocate work space at all. The morning breakfast was OK but nothing more. Luckily, we are not big eaters or gourmets. The 22nd floor consisted of a terrace with comfortable seats/couches, but nothing more. The hotel was crowded with families with a number of children each and was therefore quite noisy. We had not expected that many children and so much noise in this level of hotel. The staff were very nice and courteous. The elevators were always a problem, always busy with a fairly long waiting time. Too few active elevators for this size hotel. Business room was very functional and helpful.Overall, when we booked a room at this hotel, we expected a fairly high level hotel. What we found was a loud, noisy and crowded family hotel - which is not what we had been looking for. The daily price which we paid for our room should have gotten us much better than what we did. The very nice staff, the cleanliness of the hotel and the excellent location compensated somewhat for our disappointment.so if you are a family with children, yes- this is a hotel to go to.

We informed the hotel about this a few months prior and requested a balcony room.We arrived at the hotel around 3pm, I thoroughly recommend as a low cost option transfer from JFK to Manhattan that you take the Air Train to Jamaica, then the LIRR to Manhattan. At $14 each return it really is a superb option. The hotel is a few blocks from 34th/Penn Station which makes it an easy walk to the subway and its super close to times square. The room was ready and was exactly the same as what was requested. It was immaculately clean and had all the amenities that you would ever need. We we're extremely impressed with room. We loved the free breakfast in the morning, good selection of yogurts, fruit juices, savories and a hot selection it saved us from having to hunt down breakfast in NYC before a days sightseeing. I did have an issue is that when we booked the hotel we we're promised a managers reception, and this has been the case with other homewood suites we had stayed at previously was suddenly withdrawn which was a major disappointment. This was replaced with cookies and warm milk, which was welcome after the freezing temperatures of NYC but no where near as good as the full managers receptions we had experienced previously. This stopped me giving the property a 5 star.Property is in a quiet sidestreet, never felt unsafe during our stay at the hotel.

Normally now I tend to rent an apartment as you get far more space and you can really relax but for my last trip I was travelling alone and renting an apartment alone can be VERY expensive.So, for all my searching online and comparing sites for the best deal for a solo traveller I found Homewood Suites by Hilton. It was good price considering what would be included - king-size bed, plus sofa bed, a kitchenette, full bathroom with shower unit, work desk, air-conditioning, free Wi-Fi in the room for up to 2 devices, free local phone calls and breakfast. I was staying in NYC for 10 days so I wanted a hotel room that I could be comfortable in, and this sounded like it did the job.I arrived on a Saturday evening and it was very busy in the lobby but I was soon being checked in and went straight to my room - on the 12th Floor at the back of the hotel. The window had no views of the city to speak of, only a block of offices opposite - so keep your blinds down during the weekdays as you never know who might be looking in! However being at the back of the hotel means that you get none of the noise of the traffic coming from 8th Avenue!The room was indeed spacious for my requirements; the king-size bed really was king-size (I've been caught out before with that one). There was a reasonably comfortable sofa bed although it was never used as a bed, just a sofa. The kitchenette was very well designed with a two-ring electric hob, a microwave, full-sized fridge/freezer, dishwasher, small sink and all utensils including cutlery, plates, bowls, glasses, mugs etc. The bathroom was a good size with sink, toilet and large shower cubicle with sliding doors and came with plenty of assorted towels.A large flat-screen TV with remote control was also in the room and standard free WIFI was also available. I was able to make free local calls from the hotel room phone - although I would check with Reception first to see if the number is local before making the call!So far, so good - I was impressed with the overall standard the hotel offered however I do have a few small complaints. Firstly, the fridge/freezer was quite noisy. I'm a light sleeper so that was a problem for me. In the end I had to unplug it for most of my stay, rendering it useless if I wanted to buy food and keep it fresh. Secondly, the water pressure for the shower was rubbish, making it difficult to get clean after applying shampoo etc. The TV reception was also very bad at times and the signal kept getting lost - quite infuriating.Now, did I complain about these issues? No, to be honest I didn't. I didn't believe there was much that could be done with the fridge/freezer or the TV signal and if the shower had become worse I think the only thing they could have done would have been to move me. I think my 'list' of complaints is quite small and fairly irrelevant considering the bed was comfortable, the air-conditioning worked, the WIFI worked and was FREE (although you did have to re-log in every 24 hours but that only takes a minute) and the room was spacious - something that is SO rare in an NYC hotel these days.There is a laundry room and small gym located in the basement - although I did not use these facilities during my stay. As for the FREE breakfast, I did not end up using this as I had to leave the hotel very early every morning - although after reading other peoples reviews about how bad it was, perhaps that was for the best. However, I cannot judge something that I did not try, so I cannot comment further on that.I found the Reception staff very helpful to me and when I requested a late check-out on my day of departure. They gave me one and a half hours extra without charging me; I was therefore able to stay in the room until 1.30pm.The location of the hotel is quite superb. Located on West 37th Street, just off 8th Avenue, it is ideally located for Broadway, Times Square, Penn Station/Madison Square Garden and Macys Department Store. The nearest subways are at Penn Station or 42nd Street - 4 blocks in either direction. There is a good bus service right on the corner of West 37th Street (the M20 which goes up to Lincoln Centre at West 66th Street), but check the timetable first before using it.Overall, I really liked this hotel. I feel it offers more than most hotels in NYC, unless you are prepared to spend large sums of money, which most people aren't. For me whether its a hotel, restaurant, attraction or flight, the question I always ask myself is, would I stay or do that again? If its yes, then it must be good... and this hotel is good!","Reading, United Kingdom","SarahEJT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reading, United Kingdom</strong>",37,4.0

Both times I've been here, rooms are quiet, but I stay on upper floors - have heard from other guests that lower floors on the 37th St. side are noisy. Staff is nice and helpful.The problem? 1) Breakfast is just disgusting. I've seen better food from military ration cans. Now I can't say this is JUST this Homewood - the entire chain has gone to inedible garbage, but this one was particularly foul. 2) (and this is what put me over the line) this location has discontinued the evening reception. This is one of the main reasons I choose Homewood or Embassy Suites properties. This is just ridiculous. I don't know if this was a local management decision or a corporate one, but it's unacceptable.So...next time I will stay at another Manhattan hotel.

But 3 days of our stay there was water delivery interruptedto the hotel from 8am to 3pm. It is crazy - it's not like by Hilton but more like service in North Korean Hotel. You can't clean your face, take a shower, clean the teeth or use the toilet in the morning. Terrible. In the reception it was possible to ask for 2 small bottles of water - comfort = 0. And the rest 2 days when watter was not interrupted, it was announced by in-hotel radio at 8am - they waked us up by the announcement from radio in the room in the 8am - horrible. If they have been informed us a few days before our arrival that there is problem with water in the area where hotel is located we could rebook to any other hotel in NYC - maybe to any other Hilton. But when we were there we couldn't do anything.We have chosen that hotel because its location near to Times Square. Location of the hotel is really great - on the 37st street just a few steps from 8th Avenue where you can taste during the day-time the real rush of NYC with shopping, all various fast-foods and then enjoy night. During the night 8th Avenue is really fantastic. You can walk to the real heart of NYC - Times Square - within 5 minutes. Subway station on 8th Ave and 34the street is just around the corner, you can walk to Macy's, Madison Square Garden or take a bus in Penn Station and travel for instance to New Jersey - everything is 5-10 minutes by walk from the hotel. Really great location.I have to appreciate very kind staff of hotel - all staff - receptionist, breakfast staff, room service, upkeepers - everybody were very professional and kind.Our room in the 16th floor was relatively spacious, very nice and modern, perfectly clean and well equiped - TV, table, safe, fitted kitchen with fridge and nice bathroom with shower. I really like the large window and view to the street was also not bad. Good is that you can fully dark the window. I missed any USB charger in teh room so I had to go buy adapter immediately. Air-condition was blowing the cold air directly on our heads in the bed so we had to stop it and open the window with all the noise of NYC. The hotel has 3 elevators but sometimes in rush-hours you need to wait a few minutes for any if you are accomodated in higher floors. But this I don't find out as fundamental problem.We had problem with the TV in our room. The broadcast was not fluent and all channels was every a few seconds interrupted. What bad surprise in such modern hotel.Breakfasts are included what is great. But the choice is very limited and the taste boring. 1st day it was good, but 2nd day the same and 3rd it was better to go for breakfast out. No vegetable. Scrambled eggs - but from dried eggs. Everything is served on paper plates and in plastic cups so it produces unbelievably lot of rubbish every breakfast - the ecology = zero. You can take a coffee in lobby all the day for free but the quality is poor - as well as at breakfast. I recommend to go to Starbucks or Donut Dumpkin which are a few steps from hotel.Overall good location and kind staff. The price seemed to be fair regarding location. But with not running water and some other problems it is not adequate. It was crazy.","Pilsen, Czech Republic","JanB855</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pilsen, Czech Republic</strong>",57,3.0

However, we were able to leave our luggage with no trouble and no extra fees. I want to give credit to Michael who arranged a taxi for us to the airport. He was able to combine the trip with a few other guests so we paid less than half the fee to the airport. Since taxis are so expensive, we really saved a lot! The taxi was late and it was a bit stressful at the time, but he did a great job. Thank you!",,deejbim,0,4.0

I travelled with my sisters-in-law and we had booked the suite with 2 beds and a pullout sofa bed so that everyone could have their own bed. The challenge in NYC is a hotel with 3 beds for this type of situation....so the hotel room worked perfectly. I volunteered for the sofa bed and it was surprisingly comfortable. We had a kitchen complete with microwave, dishwasher, cook top and a full size fridge. The staff were fantastic and very accommodating. Nothing but positive feedback for the staff. The included breakfast is a great way to start the day. Yes the area for sitting and eating was generally full, however we decided to plan our morning a bit ahead of the peak breakfast time, which seemed to be around 830a-930a and we had no problems getting a spot. Close proximity to all the sights, we loved the location. Short walk to the subway which is never really that far away from any point. A 7-11 is about a half block away on 8th avenue if you are looking to grab some things. We were about a 10min walk to MSG if you are attending an event. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.

I just checked out today May 23rd, and I accidentally left my wallet in the room. It's the hotel staffs/front desk job to call the housekeeping immediately from walkie talkie and inform them so they can get the item and keep it at the front desk so I can come back to get it in a few, yet I called them several times and they kept transferring me to housekeeping but nobody answered the phone. I called again and one of the guys told me I need to leave them a voicemail. I was like you must be joking, its my freaking wallet with credit card, ID and cash in there. I need someone go up there ASAP, I don't care if that person is a front desk or housekeeping before they check a new guest into that room, that'd create even more complications. I travel frequently and all over the US. And usually if I just checked out and no guest has checked into that room yet and I forgot an item by accident (my shoes for example), all I had to do was told the front desk to make a temporary key for me to go up to my room so I can get it. All the hotels I've stayed at in the past would never had a problem with that, doesn't matter if it's Marriott or Hilton properties because it was still my room and the housekeeping hasn't even cleaned the room yet. But the front desk girl, I don't know her name, she's African American, told me she was not allowed to do that. She did use her walkie talkie to call the housekeeping and they found my wallet. Thank you for that.That was around 4 pm, I hung out in the lobby for little bit then I asked the same front desk lady if she could store the luggage for me because I haven't eaten anything all day and I'm starving, I needed to go to a restaurant nearby because there's no restaurant on site. And she has the audacity to ask me if I'm staying at the hotel another night. I said no, and then she said then we won't be able to store your luggage. I was like are you out of your mind, do you really expect me to drag these two heavy luggages out onto the street and to a restaurant when I'm a guest here and was just staying at the hotel and just checked out barely 2-3 hours ago. That was extremely rude and unprofessional of her on so many levels. I've stayed at plenty of hotels and I swear to Jesus none of the front desk people would said such a nonsense like that to me. This is NYC, my flight won't be til later in the evening, does she really expect me to go shopping around Time Square with a big 28"" luggage with me? Haha I swear I was so close to make a scene at the hotel but since I haven't eaten anything I didn't have energy, or else I'd personally ask to speak to the manager already. That was ridiculous. Who does that? The manager at this property seriously needs to train these front desk more, not just this young African American lady and tell them to smile and have more energetic/friendly/helpful attitude. And last but not least, the Internet service here is awful like it's not even funny. My 4G barely works on 12th floor. I love Hilton properties, I've stayed at plenty of Hilton Garden Inn, Homewood Suites, Hampton Inn, etc. But I'll not be returning to this one for sure. ",,Thai T,1,1.0

This time I stayed from around 15-20th of the month and was not impressed at all. To start with, there was no water in the hotel after 8 am till the evening. I get it, this wasn't due to some civil work being done but at least they could have informed me about it prior to my booking. The person at the reception said that they had sent texts out but we never received a text and apparently neither did many of the other guests. This was by far the most annoying thing since we had to get up really early and couldn't sleep properly. Also, which hotel does not have water tankers to keep a stock of basic running water in the sink and toilets for these kind of issues?Coming to the service, it was just about average. The housekeeping did not clean the room well. On one occasion they forgot to empty the trash bin in the room. Also, they never put garbage bags in the trash cans and then didn't wash the bin well resulting in a mildly foul smell. Furthermore, they forgot to replace the soap in the bathroom a few times and we had to tell them again.The room did not have a laundry bag which they had last time. I went to the lobby to ask for one and they said they were out of those and instead gave me flimsy plastic bags which couldnt hold the clothes and kept tearing so we had to carry laundry around in our backpack.The hot water in the lobby for tea/cocoa was often lukewarm and thus not fit for purpose. Several times I just had to take the tea bag and then heat the water in the room. The spread of the breakfast also has been drastically reduced and is quite repetitive. Sorry if this seemed like a rant, aside from these issues the rooms are still good and decent in size and the staff is polite. On the bright side, they used to keep orange and cucumber water by the lobby which made for a good refreshment after those crowded walks in Times Square.","New Delhi, India","Varun G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Delhi, India</strong>",0,3.0

It was easy to walk from Penn Station, just about three blocks. Check-in was smooth and we were informed of city waterworks that were going to happen Saturday morning. The water would be shut off from 8am and could be for most of the day. We were given bottles of water and more water when we asked for some later the next day. It didn't bother us too much because we were out by the shut off time. Even with this unforeseen hiccup, our stay was great. We had a room on the 19th floor and had a great view of Garment District buildings. Lobby was busy at all times, but clean and modern with coffee available 24/7. Three elevators up to the rooms, which can be slowish at peak times (like when breakfast is served). There is a small rooftop patio on floor 22 (just seating, no bar or food served up there) and a gym in the basement. No pool. The room was a great size for two adults and a 6yr old. King sized bed, a full sized sofa/sofa bed, good sized fridge and full freezer, microwave, two ring stove, dishes for four, a toaster, small coffee pot, desk with a slide out table to eat on, roomy shower stall and bathroom. Really surprised by the generous size of the room, even when the sofa bed was out for the night there was still room to get around to the fridge. The room was also quite by NYC standards, helped by the hotel being off a main street and surrounded by offices/businesses that operate M-F. We cooked for ourselves, taking a Lyft to Whole Foods to buy groceries. I can't vouch for the places nearby to the hotel to eat, but for quick snacks and drinks there is a 7-11 on the corner. Restaurants and fast food galore are near the hotel if you are inclined to eat out. Breakfast is served, included with your stay, with the usual hotel breakfast foods (toast, breakfast meat, eggs, oatmeal, cold cereal, yogurt, fruit, coffee/tea, and juice). The breakfast area was swarming with people, but there was plenty of food. If your are interested in tourist trips or shows, there is a concierge at the hotel who can help with bookings, as well as all the open top bus tour people hawking tickets on 8th Avenue. Subway stops are also nearby, but we mainly walked or used Lyft. We will definitely be back at this hotel in the future.

While I was unfortunately alerted by the hotel a few days before our stay that there wouldn't be water from 8-3 for a few days during our stay (due to the city doing water maintenance), they did everything to make it right. Check-in online was a breeze and when we arrived the first thing the front desk staff did was acknowledge the inconvenience and supply us with several bottles of water. The water issues caused housekeeping to delay their room-cleaning efforts so when we got back to our room around 5 p.m. one day and saw them still cleaning, they were very apologetic. No issue for us as we understood what they were dealing with earlier when having no water. A couple hours later, we received a knock at the door with an apology and a bag of goodies, including additional Hilton Honors points. So unexpected yet so very appreciated!

The lodging more than met expectations. The room was clean, neat and quiet. The bed was comfortable and the amenities were solid. My only disappointment was the bathtub which did not have a functioning drain stopper for taking a bath (or soaking tired feet from miles of walking). Homewood suites provided hot, cooked breakfast every morning and the food was good. Hot coffee was available 24/7. The desk staff were very helpful in providing information and transportation as requested. The only thing missing at Homewood Suites was a bar. There was a rooftop patio that was very inviting and would have been a good place to relax at the end of the day.

Very close to NY Penn Station and Times Square venues. Looks like recent renovation, surrounded by businesses. Check in fast and efficient. Room not ready, so we left our bags and the hotel texted us when ready. About 30 min ahead of normal check in time. Hotel down a side street off 8th Ave, so was quiet at night. First floor was lobby, and dining area, which after breakfast is mostly closed to access. Except for a high top table by the door, some seating/table around a fire place and a few small tables, not much of a lobby. We had a two full-size bed studio. Advertised as queen beds, but definitely full size - even called the front desk and was told this was a Hilton standard, either two full-size ""queen"" beds or one king bed. By Manhattan standards, room was huge. Had a fold out twin sofa bed, plus full kitchen (electric stovetop, microwave, fridge/freezer and sink - plenty of dishes/glasses and kitchenware to reheat leftovers/etc. Bathroom was small, no countertop to speak off, to place cosmetics, glasses, toothbrush or even the supplied hair dryer. Only closet in bathroom, with a safe. No cabinets. Just three drawers on a desk unit. But spacious to put luggage along wall. Bathroom, except for being small, was fine. Very hot shower. Ceiling fan in bedroom was nice touch. Kept air circulating. AC/heater was a bit noisy at night, and thermostat not very accurate or sensitive, as I got up during the night to adjust the temperature - too cold or too hot.Three elevators, but were extremely slow. Avoid a high floor in case you want to walk down stairs. We ended up walking often, as the elevator is used by staff as well.Breakfast was typical, okay if you are in a hurry, and need some food to get started, but all precooked packaged items, scrambled eggs, sausage, french toast, waffles, juices, bagels, oatmeal, fruit. Coffee was bad, but plentiful. Seating gets taken fast, so if you come late, expect to be split up as a group, or take food back to your room. Plenty of restaurants, coffee shops nearby, so save the calories for something worth it.Location, location, location. Across the street was a Courtyard by Marriott property. Expensive though, $300+ a night.

It's a hike to get to Central Park or for sure a bus or train ride to lower Manhattan. As for being up to Homewood Suites standards, the rooms are clean and the beds are comfortable. They are not big rooms by any stretch of the imagination. TV had a large scratch on the front (Rm 1401). Breakfast was very repetitive though and rather lacking for a Homewood Suites. Had no variety at all over 4 days...just alternated the eggs back and forth, and the other item was the same except one day. Lacking in muffins and bagel options with only mini apple strudels 4 days in a row and plain mini-bagels daily. French toast and waffles in steamer tray were not fresh tasting. No waffle maker. No Robust version of coffee and only sweetened creamer options. No plain half and half. Also...no manager's reception whatsoever on the weekdays like EVERY OTHER HOMEWOOD SUITES EVERYWHERE. This caps it off as to not returning. For what they charge, it should be included. Lastly, elevators took forever and even on 2 of 4 days were one elevator down at times. Programming seems off...wait forever while an elevator sits motionless several floors above or below and others dart around and often skip the floor while the other one doesn't move. Was not during housekeeping hours either. Parking...well, it's independent and $45/day....and just 1/2 block past the hotel entry...where there is no drop-off space. Expect to walk with your luggage in-hand. Just beware that on 2 evenings, if you go to pay to get out, there was a chicken-scrawled note that the credit card machine was ""down"" mysteriously so you'll have to pony up cash or find an ATM. Seems to me that's just too odd this happens only during evenings...is the parking staff skimming? Hmmm....not sure...but just something to note. I did try to contact the hotel several times to get parking info ahead and it was inconsistent on the info I got. Given the above, I will stay elsewhere next time.

They were accommodating last time, but I got a room that faced the interior alley and office building; however, I was just thankful then. This time I arrived early, but since no room available we did not come back until 9 pm. Instead of having a room for me based on my original arrival time it appears that I received the last room - another interior facing room. The Sunday EVENING staff (lady) was abrupt telling me there were no other rooms when I called down. I texted the hotel the next morning. They apologized and asked what they could do, but what could they do at that point? It was too late. They said that I should have asked for a particular kind of room when I arrived in the morning, but I just thought that would be common sense. I know better now for this hotel. I will keep it in mind when I come back to NYC later this year. This particular stay has impressed on me how important it is to get a room with a view.

This is in New York;s fashion district and is within a few minutes walk of Time Square or Empire State building. Like most well located city centre hotels staying here is quite expensive, but I would say by New York standards reasonable value.Check-in was efficient. Our 10th floor room, although not as spacious as other Homewood Suites we have stayed in, was perfectly adequate with the available space cleverly used. Everything was clean and comfortable and the room was freshly made up on each day of our three day stay.The room had a large TV, good wi-fi, bathroom with shower. There was a kitchen area built into the room with a two burner stove, combination microwave oven, dishwasher, fridge with small freezer and a few pans. Although we had originally planned to cook our own evening meals we ended up buying food from a nearby deli and warming it in the microwave.In the basement of the hotel there is a fitness suite and a guest laundry with washers $2.50 and dryers again $2.50. There is a small store in the lobby which sells washing powder.In the lobby coffee is available (I guess 24/7) and mid afternoon cookies appear. Unlike some Homewood Suites there is no evening reception. Breakfast served from 600 to 10 30 was OK with a choice of hot or cold food.A bonus on a fine day is the rooftop terrace on 22nd floor.There are three elevators serving the needs of both guests and staff so at busy times there can be a sort wit until a lift arrives at your floor.In summary a very convenient place to stay when visiting New York City. It offers a good compromise between the budget and luxury ends of the market.

I booked the hotel before we knew which theatre shows we would attend, and it was fate that one theatre was several blocks south and the other several blocks north of the hotel, with it in the middle. (There are a good number of Off-Broadway theatres in this area.) While the subway line isn't all that close compared to other hotels in NYC, we did use it, as well as walking a lot, including over to MOMA and up Broadway and the distances were tolerable. The staff were nice and the room was clean and a good size for NYC. Having a kitchenette with refrigerator was great. However, as other guests have mentioned, though, the #1 problem with this hotel is the elevators. In the morning it was difficult to get an elevator because they serve not only guests, but a staff member told me they don't have a freight/staff elevator so it's both guests and staff jockeying for elevators. This is especially difficult because if staff are on the elevators, they tend to stop at many more intermediate floors than they would if it were simply guests going to the lobby. Also, they turned the far right elevator off at night so there were only two working. We went up to the roof deck which must be nice in summer, but even on a warm-ish for February day, it wasn't much of a view. We were on the 17th floor and were not bothered by light or sound so we slept well (which can be hard to do in the city). There isn't much on the short block the hotel is on (food or otherwise), but there is a cheap pizza place on the corner and a really good burger place just a block or so away. The best thing about the hotel is it is near Times Square, but not actually in it, so it's not that crowded or blindingly bright. Breakfast was a bit of craziness as it was crowded and hard to find a table each morning. The parking garage the hotel partners with is a bit down the street and was being renovated when we checked out, so retrieving my car was a bit of a challenge. There was also very limited parking in front of the hotel for loading/unloading, so be aware of that as well. Overall we'd stay here again, but be aware of the elevator issues - apparently it's an ongoing concern from reading other comments.","Boston, MA","Bloomchen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, MA</strong>",23,5.0

We were a party of 5 split between 2 rooms.One of the receptionists was very professional and seemed to know what she was doing, whilst the other one had to ask a manager for assistance as she wanted to put the 5 of us in one room, then wanted to give us 3 rooms, at an extra expense?? Luckily i had my hotel voucher which proved we had paid for 2 rooms. The room for the 2 friends was ready, so we piled the cases into that room, had a natter whilst they unpacked. The room was large with a double wardrobe, a full kitchen area and a nice bathroom.We hit NYC and didn't get back to the hotel until after 8pm. We got the key to our room. It was smaller than our friends room, a single wardrobe and less floor space? The bed settee wasn't made up and the light under the microwave wouldn't turn off. To start swapping rooms just seemed too much hard work as we were very tired. One of my friends went down to ask for the bed settee to be made up and also asked why the light under the microwave wouldn't turn off. We were told an engineer would sort the light out the following morning. Was that tired just agreed.Have to say the mattress was very comfy and had a good nights sleep even with the jet lag. Breakfast was good. On our way out asked about the engineers visit, to be informed that it was a switch on the microwave that turned the light out, by the professional receptionist. Breakfast on the Monday morning was erratic and took more than 40 minutes before we finally managed to get a seat. It would make sense if someone, kept an eye on people eating. Several tables had finished eating but were obviously discussing their plans for the day, which could have been conducted in the soft seating area.Also, more notices about clearing your own table, would help as you weren't always sure whether a table was empty or whether they'd gone back to replenish their breakfast!On the whole the hotel was good, the view of the ESB on the roof terrace was great. Its a little out of the main stretch, but does give you a quieter nights sleep. The maid service was great and the majority of staff were polite and helpful.

Given NYC prices, we felt the suites were good value for money.The negatives - the property was extremely busy, hosting several tour parties as well as independent guests. This meant long delays in hailing the lifts, repeated difficulties finding a table at breakfast and queues at the reception desk and the breakfast offerings. We also suspect it was why we didn't secure a suite on a higher floor with a view, despite having requested this in advance, being a member of the Honors club, and staying 10 nights (we noted the tour party guests were mostly on the high floors).

Nice touch with 24 hour hot drinks, went down a treat after a long day site seeing.Our room was on the 17th floor, never had a problem waiting for the lifts. One day on new year we waited a while.

It is a ten minute walk from Times Square, which was actually a bonus as Times Square was filled with hordes of people and the summer temps, humidity and smells were unpleasant, so we avoided the area like the plague. The Homewood Suites is a short walk to the subway, which we used to get around Manhattan. There is a Subway sandwich shop and a Chipotles nearby. Outside the hotel was not the nicest area, but I felt safe and walked all over with my 13 y.o. son, even at night. The lobby was modern, clean, welcoming and safe. We stayed in a 295 sq. ft. efficiency studio with a king size bed. The kitchenette included a tiny sink, 2 burners, microwave, toaster, little dishwasher and a small but full size refrigerator/freezer. Under the desk was a pull out table we used with the desk chair and little love seat for our dining area. There was plenty of storage for our clothes and luggage, and the bed and shower were both comfortable. The AC/heat worked well. The room was quite clean, except for the wood floors. They looked clean, but dark wood hides dirt. We took our shoes off upon entering the room and when my son sat on the bed, the dust bunnies and dirt from the wood floor transferred from his socks to the bed spread. I mopped the floor with a wet towel, which was filthy when I finished. The staff at the front desk apologized and offered us a small discount on one of our nights. We stayed on the 10th and 12th floors away from the elevator and never heard other guests. We never had trouble getting an elevator. The free breakfast was just ok, but included a lot of choices - some combination of hot foods (turkey bacon or sausage, eggs, potatoes), oatmeal, cereal, bread, pastries and bagels, fresh fruit (apples, oranges, bananas and sometimes melon), yogurt, juice and milk. There were cookies and appetizers some evenings in the lobby and a gym in the basement which we did not use. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely chose the Homewood Suites Midtown Manhattan South again. We booked just a month in advance. Had we booked earlier we may have gotten a lower rate, but our average price for 4 nights was $250 a night, which is still a deal for a place with a kitchen and free breakfast in the heart of NYC.","Beaverton, Oregon","Chabelita545</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Beaverton, Oregon</strong>",3,4.0

Great value and only 10 min max walking to Times Square (and you're only about 5 minutes walking to a CVS/Kmart) The hotel has such an amazing staff, honestly, the kindest and most helpful people I met in New York. They were always so kind to us and I do believe that if there would have been any problems, they would have sorted them out immediately. The room we had was very nice except the sofa bed is a bit worn out (that's why sleep quality only gets 4*) The room itself wasn't really large but hey, you're in NYC. There was a large fridge there and a microwave, which was very nice and convenient. The breakfast was lovely and super busy!

I had originally booked a Hilton in the FiDi for four nights but when our plans changed, I could not get the same rate but found a slightly better rate at the Homewood Suites Times Square South. Frankly, I was a bit less enthusiastic because of the location, which has historically not been a top one for tourists (though safe). It has not been known for good dining, for example.I need not have worried. The hotel, itself, is newer and the rooms exhibit an ingenious use of space and give the impression of being larger than they are. We had a king room with a twin sofabed that sat two, as well as a desk and chair, a small sofa table which could be used for snacks and another ingenious feature--a rolling table, stored under the desk, at which three people could sit and eat. There is a real closet and set of drawers and a nice bath with shower. There is also a kitchenette in each room with a two burner stovetop, full refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher and enough utensils, tableware and cookware to satisfy anyone! While the hotel does include breakfast in the rate (some hot and cold options such as cereals, prepared eggs and meats, toast, bagels and several healthy options such as fruit, yogurt and oatmeal), the kitchenette is handy if you would rather prepare breakfast and eat in the room, buy and prepare lunch and dinner provisions or leftovers or just have snacks! Our room was on the 17th floor facing West 37th Street and we were not bothered by noise. The double shades ensured that lighting was blocked so we slept well.Location-wise, the hotel is convenient to Penn Station and Port Authority Bus terminal, both of which we used during our stay. But it is also far enough from each that one is not bothered by their congestion. It is in walking distance to Grand Central Station, from which we took a train up the Hudson Valley for a day trip AND it is within walking distance to great dining options on 9th Avenue and the upper West 30s. FINALLY, the staff is fantastic: friendly and service-oriented. Despite the crowds over the holidays, checkin was fast and courteous, the breakfast dining area was constantly cleaned and food replenished, the housekeeping very good. Kudos especially to the front-desk staff who noticed I had left my IPad behind and retrieved it for me.

I knew that hotels in NY tend to have smaller rooms. We had a suite with a king bed and a pull out sofa. This is not like most of the Homewood Suites that I've stayed at. The king bed and the sofa bed were side by side. This was not a suite. It was a room with a king bed and a sofa bed (twin size). The room was quite small and difficult for 3 of us to move around in. There was very little storage, so we all pretty much lived out of our suitcases. The rooms were clean and well maintained. The complimentary breakfast was good. I would caution everyone to choose a room higher up because the lobby noise was definitely audible from the 2nd floor. One night, there was a large and noisy group still going at 12:45 AM and keeping us awake. I am a Hilton Honors diamond member, so I have pretty high expectations of the higher tier hotels.

Room was very clean, modern and updated. During 17 degree weather the lobby was toasty warm as was the staff. Very efficient check-in with plenty of people at the front desk. I called downstairs once and within minutes someone was at my room to assist me with something I couldn't figure out. Everyone was very helpful and courteous. I never eat the free hotel breakfast, but I saw many families eating during my stay, and they seemed to be enjoying it. There's a very good grocery store Brooklyn Fare a couple of blocks away. They have everything you need to stock your refrigerator, plus toiletries, etc. The room size was easily double what I had when I stayed one week at a Hampton Inn at Times Square. I would never stay there again after staying at the Homewood Suites. The walk to Penn Station is more like 3/10 of a mile than 6/10 like another reviewer wrote. You need to exit on the 8th avenue side of the station. I took the train from the airport both ways pulling a suitcase, my large tote bag and a yoga mat easily. The walk was less than 10 minutes even on the crowded streets, and waiting for lights to change.The only recommendation I have is there are thousands of people coming through this hotel daily and I never saw a hand sanitizing station. I kept looking for them. People all around me were coughing and sneezing in fairly close quarters and bathroom access is limited. Plus, a lot of people don't wash their hands even with access to a sink. I would love to see more places do what my Whole Foods in Coral Gables did. They have sinks inside and outside the bathroom specifically for people to wash their hands prior to eating along with hand sanitizers. Other than that, this hotel is a winner.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Kellyexcursions</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",61,5.0

We took a cab over and it cost about $50 from LaGuardia and about 30 minutes (traffic was good). We got there super early (around 9am) and they let us check in and held our bags until the room was ready. The customer service was exceptional and they called us by 11am with a room ready.We were on the second floor which I was worried about at first because of street noise. Truthfully it wasn't a problem except the trash and laundry pickup a couple nights around 11pm and mornings early. Other than rush hour, traffic on 37th wasn't bad so it was actually pretty quiet. The advantage to the low floor like that is that the wait for elevators seemed long most days at busy times so we actually used it only 3 times in 6 days.Breakfast was okay. Don't expect any pork but there was always some eggs and turkey sausage/bacon, and other things like hash browns or waffles. We stocked up on coffee each morning and also on the way back through the lobby every day. Overall we didn't pay for breakfast a single day which allowed us to fit some better options in for lunch and dinner each day. To us, that was a great deal.The location is 2 blocks north of the 34th street station entrance to pick up the A,C, E trains. Or you can walk another block and get to 1,2,3 train or 2 more (in the other direction or continuing down the island) to get to a bunch of other lines.One of the absolute best things about this hotel is the location. You are a few blocks from Times Square, Bryant Park, Macy's, and the Empire State Building. However you are tucked away off of 8th instead of stuck right in the middle of all the noise and confusion. We were in the subway within 2 minutes of the hotel or Times Square/Macy's/MSG within 5. The bed was SUPER comfortable, pillow was superb, and there were plenty of channels on the TV. We didn't have any issues and the room was way cleaner than many I have stayed in larger cities. Service was outstanding!!! However... Let me say this... We were super nice to the front desk and they were beyond kind in return. We witnessed a couple being rude to the front desk and they got less than desirable service in return. But that has been my experience everywhere in NYC other than the poshest joints. If you are nice to New Yorkers, they will be nice right back. If you are a jerk... Well...Overall I would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling for pleasure. You can get downtown, Central Park, Brook, Times Square, the Village, etc. very conveniently! Nice rooms, nice people, and a wonderful stay.","Dorchester, South Carolina","alistair_connor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dorchester, South Carolina</strong>",95,5.0

The rooms have a fridge, a microwave and a stove, which could be useful for some. Also, if you have a big family and are budget minded, they do offer very basic complimentary breakfast in the morning.I had a pretty awful experience with housekeeping. My girlfriend and I left the room at 9am (made sure the ""shhhh"" sign was off), and when we got back at 2:15pm the room still was not made! I figured ""ok, this happens"", called housekeeping and asked to bring new towels. After the towels came, my girlfriend and I took a little nap, only to be woken up 20 minutes into-it by another housekeeping person who disregarded the ""do not disturb"" sign and brought more towels. When I asked her why would she disturb us despite the sign, she simply said ""I have your towels"" - not even an apology. Also, the immediate neighborhood is pretty sketchy, and the rooms are definitely on a small side. So, we stayed there two nights, our room was never made, and the housekeeping was outright rude or inconsiderate - you pick.

For each of these stays, I have taken advantage of the check in option promoted and provided by Hilton via their app. NEVER once did I encounter the issue I encountered at this property.This property DECIDES to put a hold on your card when you use the check in option PRIOR TO CHECK IN, SO, if you decide to use a different card, other than the one which is attached to your Hilton account, you cannot without having two holds on two different accounts. At no other Hilton properties has this occurred BEFORE I arrive to check in.I am not naive or uneducated about the use of holds, however, I was NOT told that my card attached to my Hilton account had had a hold placed upon it when I checked in and requested a different card be used.When I contacted the front desk prior to departure and then again afterward via the online survey and comments, I was sent an email by the Assistant Manager of the Front Desk that said, ""we apologize the old if the hold of funds trumped your experience in NYC . . . "" Word choice aside, I then contacted Hilton Corporate offices and was told that this property's staff lied and said they told me about the hold upon check in. Common sense strongly opposes this claim of theirs because what customers would agree to two holds on two separate cards at the same time tying up hundreds of dollars?? And my cousin, who was with me at check in, can verify that this information was not given to me as ""claimed"" by the staff.The Asst. Manager ended the email with ""We hope this instance does not deter you from returning to our property once more in the future."" This is a joke, right?

Check in was pretty good - not sure why and I find this in most of the hotels we stay in that no matter how early I make the reservation and request to be put on a higher floor in a quiet room away from the elevators it never happens. And again with this hotel, we were put on the 5th floor although it was a room away from the elevators. If there is a secret to getting on one of the higher floors would love to know what it is. Doesn't matter if your a rewards member or not, we just cannot seem to get that request honored. The rooms there are really nice, the small kitchen area with the stainless steel and granite and wood or laminate flooring instead of dirty rugs are really nice. Everything is very modern in the rooms. The rooms are pretty quiet to outside noise of the streets also. Now onto the bad - we always completely check the beds when we first check in and one of the beds in our room definitely needed to be replaced as did the sheet on it. While it was apparently washed and clean everywhere else, there was a stain looked like coffee or tea on it at the end of the bed and the bed itself was in pretty rough shape. I wanted to change rooms because of it but we were heading out to eat and a basketball game and did not have the time. Also, the breakfast was bad. I know it's free but the waffles were cold and just tasted weird. The eggs were bad and we have never come across this at a hotel, but they had no regular half and half just a bunch of flavored/sweetened creamers which neither my husband or I like. So we didn't have any coffee and seeing as we drink that first thing in the morning especially after our late night, it was disappointing.

There is a coin operated laundry with 4 washers & 4 dryers as well as a business centre with 2 computers/printers etc. There were power points by the bed and on the desk as well as in the kitchenette to recharge batteries etc and a safe & microwave. Several places to eat around the corner on 8th Ave and Times Square is about 10-15 minutes walk. 7/11 around the corner as well. We travelled with our 7yr old so being close to everything was great.

Can't recommend this place enough! The staff is extremely friendly and helpful and allowed us to leave our bags with them free of charge while we went to walk around Times Square. The hotel is extremely close to everything, close enough that you could pretty much walk to wherever without having to call fur a taxi/Uber. The atmosphere was amazing, our room was nice, beds are extremely comfy. Breakfast is free, but I suggest getting there as soon as it opens as it can get packed pretty fast. Coffee/tea/hot chocolate is served all day for free as well which was a plus for us as it was a little cold when we visited. I do want to add that some comments have said the elevators are slow, but my guess is because the hotel has 22 floors. :) They did seem fast to us whenever we needed it, and if we did have to wait it was only for about a minute or two, but nothing more than that.I can't recommend Homewood Suites enough, and will definitely make this my go to hotel for future trips to New York.

I like beer!Our room was a studio with view, (well we saw the road and street from the window) and in reality if it were an inward facing i would have been totally uncomfortable as it was too dark however the room was a good size with fridge, sink and the microwave that we didn't use, in fact I think it would have been a nicer space if these were removed for us as we would never use them and the fridge whistled when it turned on automatically at night which was annoying and it wasn't a friendly whistle, more of a high pitched weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee if the description is of use....?The bed was a good UK King Size and the sofa bed was a UK Double Bed size itself however my 8 yr old son did highlight it was a little 'springy' in his back so not a great nights sleep if you are staying on it long-term. Little tip for the aircon, override the auto button and select the temp with fan on low as the vent blows in your face like a gale if your bed, (like ours) had the head-end directly opposite. My other half moaned that it was a regular 'ice blast' when the temp got too warm which was fine for me as I was on the other side and used her as a windbreak!Bathroom was shower only and perfectly clean, can't really think of more to say than that... Oh it was a little cold...The team on reception were very friendly and we booked a car back to JFK for $65 (plus tip) which is way below what was quoted on here before and comparable with a yellow cab and we got a Lincoln Town Car (but the driver drove like we were on fire which woke me up nicely for check-in...)Breakfast was the real bonus, the waffles were great and I over-ate these making me feel like an overweight mule wandering around Manhattan, there was also fruit salad, bagels, french toast, small selection of cereals and toast which for me was fine however you may want more from a breakfast but then in NYC breakfast is usually an additional charge so 'lap it up it' was great. Free coffee in reception was really nice and useful with my usual slow awakening although I think it was a little weak which is saying something for a Londoner! Try the hot chocolate sachets though they were really nice.... This should so be a 5 Star place and I WOULD come back no problem but I have dropped a star because I just found the place very claustrophobic due mainly to decor but I would recommend staying here without a shadow of a doubt!",London,"Jimbles</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",33,4.0

For example, I came in just as they were cleaning up after breakfast and someone saw I was looking for milk for my coffee. Even though breakfast had been all put away, he went to the kitchen and brought me a cup of milk for my coffee. I really appreciated it because they had plenty of creamer available (I don't like creamer) and they could have left me to that. The breakfast was much better than expected. There was waffles, potatoes, turkey sausage or bacon, and something else hot every day. There was also pastries, cereals, yogurt, fruit, fruit salad, bagels, and toast. The only problem was that it was a zoo during breakfast. We made it down to the lobby when it was relatively quiet one morning, but the other five mornings the lobby was filled with noisy kids.

Prior to our booking we became members of Hilton honors and we received the best offer.Reception, housekeeping and generally the staff exceeded our expectations and were friendly and accommodating. It’s nice to hear welcome back after you are out the whole day. Also their restaurant list and specially the tip for the best burger was an extra bonus.Although we did not care about evening reception which is not common in Europe still others complained but for us was not an issue. What was a nice touch though is that 24/7 you could enjoy a hot coffee tea and fresh fruits.Room was pretty spacious around 29 m2 with a nice bathroom (only drawback that as most NY hotels have a shower screwed on the wall. Second day we went to close pharmacy which is open 24/7 and bought a sponge.) The closet was big enough for couple of people that travel with light luggage. Of course they had a 3 drawer furniture were most of our cloths were fitted.Housekeeping and cleanliness was excellent and they never bothered us.You cannot get wrong by choosing to stay here and value for money it’s a fact!The neighborhood was ok and although we walked a lot and most of the times returned by foot even late at night (i.e. after a night show at Maddison square garden which is very close) we never felt any threat whatsoever.

Unfortunately when we arrived, we were told they were unable to accommodate our request (after we asked why our rooms were on different floors) and when we asked why after confirmation were they not able to?

The service was great all the way through. From the time we got to the hotel (about 5 hours before their scheduled check in time), the staff was helpful and allowed us to stow our bags safely while we went out to explore the city. I've been to some hotels that leave your bag in the entrance/lobby, and I've never had an issue, but am always worried about the possibility that someone could potentially steal something has always been in the back of my mind. The Homewood Suites moved our luggage to their storage space for this, and gave me luggage tickets for when we returned so I felt much better.After check in, the staff said they would bring our luggage up right away. It did take about 15-20 minutes for them to do this, for some reason. We weren't in a rush, but we were surprised at the amount of time. The man came to our room with the luggage and apologized so many times for the wait. It wasn't an issue it all, he kept saying ""so sorry for the wait"" and we assured him that it was fine.We could change the temperature very easily, and it worked very quickly to heat or cool our room down (probably because it's a small area - but not in a bad way, I've definitely seen smaller hotel rooms in NYC, this was very roomy). The fridge, dishwasher and sink worked perfectly (we didn't use the microwave or anything else, but I'm sure they were more than fine). The view was just of the street and the building across from us, not sure what people are really expecting from a New York hotel room, but this was more than fine.The location is close to Times Square, yes of course it is a bit of a walk (maybe 10 minutes?) but 5 blocks away is very close when you're talking about New York. There is so much within walking distance, and it's close to the Port Authority Bus Terminal (we took a shuttle bus from Newark Airport to the Port Authority) so it was a quick walk.The room was always clean and has a very modern look to it. We booked this hotel also because of the free breakfast included. We loved it! No, it's not a gourmet meal, if that's what you're looking for, then go somewhere else and pay a lot of money for it. I've stayed at other hotels and the ""free breakfast"" was a sad excuse, but I still didn't complain because it was free. In this case, there was so much variety and the food was hot, there's not much else you can ask for. Coffee and other hot drinks were always available in the lobby (I believe 24 hours) and the breakfast room was never too crowded. It was busy and sometimes you had to wait for a seat for maybe a minute or so, but mostly because someone chose to leave a mess when they left the table. The staff did come and clean up for those people rather quickly, but there are bins to put your plates and cutlery, and garbages for anything else, it's not hard to clean up your own mess when all you have to do is put the items in a bin!Also, the TV in the room was great, I think it was a SmartTV, although I didn't really use it for that function. It did lose signal quite a bit, maybe every 5-10 minutes or so there would be a few seconds of delay, so that was kind of annoying. But, we weren't in the room/ watching TV long enough to be bothered by that.I will definitely stay at this hotel again. The service was wonderful and everything about it made my stay so great. I really enjoyed it.",,Laura T,0,5.0

Arriving at the hotel, I told the girl at the front desk that, besides my previous request, my husband was not felling well, and, as a Hilton Honor member, kindly ask for a room. To make long story short. We had to wait four hours. Yes, 4 hours! During my stay, I had to ask twice for the housekeeping service. Another thing that me and many others guests complained is that the hotel is not offering the social evening any more. It is a pitty. It was good to meet new people, to hear different experiences.

Homewood Suites is new-ish (opened 2014?) and I appreciate the rooms (true to website), amenities like free wi-fi for Hilton Members and 24/7 coffee/tea/hot chocolate in the lobby. I have stayed in Marriott's Residence Inns and this is Hilton answer to the ""suite"" hotel with a hot breakfast. Did not use the gym but it looked like the website photos. There are also laundry facilities on site so it would be great for families. All staff encountered was pleasant, and housekeeping did not disappoint. Breakfast was bountiful but be sure to go before 9am or you will have a hard time finding a table. If weather is good a nice outdoor patio is available, and worst case, you can spill into the lobby seating. One plea to hotel management, I appreciated the hot breakfast but any way to improve the scrambled eggs? It had a custard like consistency so wondering if they started out as powdered? Great Points - This is a great hotel for conferences at Javitz. Walking straight down West 37th brings you to the front door of Javitz which is the big plus for this hotel, a 10 minute walk for me. Another big plus is the proximity to 2 major transport hubs, Port Authority bus terminal and Penn Station for Amtrak. If coming in to NYC it would be great, I flew in to NYC so not helpful for me. Notable Issues - I used to live in Manhattan for about 7 years for grad school and first job post graduation so I feel I know Manhattan well enough. This location is basically the garment district and nestled between Penn Station and Port Authority it is not quite Chelsea, Time Square or Hells Kitchen. If pushed, it is lower Time Square but not quite the Theater District. Yes, it is an odd neighborhood and my main issue is the lack of restaurants that are not fast food in the ""immediate"" surroundings. Don't get me wrong there are some (Tavola Italian) and some pubs but I counted THREE Dunkin Donuts, a 7-11, and a pizza slice place within a block of the hotel for context. For a classic NYC Diner I went to the Skylight Dinner on 34th and even the hotel's in-room compendium lists Ellen's Stardust Diner and that is on 51st and 7th. Bottom line, Homewood is fabulous for conferences at Javitz. However, make plans for evening entertainment/meals elsewhere if you don't just want a slice of pizza or a take away.

The staff is wonderful. The hotel is modern and top-notch. The rooms are spacious and comfortable.

Penn Street Station is only 3 blocks away and the Empire State Building and Times Square are within easy walking distance.We thought the hotel was good value for money and would definitely recommend this hotel to others it would be our first choice if we return to New York, nothing was too much trouble and it was very clean.Thank you for making us feel so welcome, we've stayed in a few hotels on our trip and this was definitely one of the best.","Rugby, United Kingdom","Hetthepet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rugby, United Kingdom</strong>",62,5.0

This I thought, was a lovely touch. The room itself was very modern. We had a small kitchen area which had a fridge, dishwasher, microwave and all utensils. The bathroom was spacious and clean. We had a great view looking over the city ahead. We had free breakfast each morning which I thought was enough. I didn't want a big pancake or breakfast anywhere. So here you could work away at hot food such as eggs, bacon etc. Or you could have cereals, porridge, toast, yogurts, fruit. What more do people want for breakfast? I had seen to many reviews about people complaining about this. They also offered free tea/coffee/hot chocolate all day.

The room was a good size for NYC, there was a hot breakfast every morning, and the hotel is new so everything was in nice condition and looked good. A perk, there is a nice rooftop patio and nobody uses it because every time we were up there, we were alone. So a bit of outdoor space, plus a mini kitchen in the room, made me think this hotel would be good for long stays too. Being in midtown made it easy to get to everywhere we were visiting in Manhattan. This is plenty close to Times Square, you only have to walk up a few short blocks. I would choose staying here vs a Times Square hotel to avoid the crowds of Times Square. Was very happy it was easy and free to check bags at the front desk as we had to check out at noon but didn't have to go to the airport til 7pm on our last day. The hotel staff was pretty helpful but we did ask for a switch to a room with a tub and they were not able to or didn't try very hard to do that. And we asked for a late checkout as my husband wasn't feeling very good and we only got an extra half hour. So nothing bad at all, but don't expect them to be super accommodating.

The daytime offerings of coffee and cookies were a nice touch and whilst we didn't try the salad bar offerings between 5pm and 7pm it looked alright if that's what you want. Facilities such as a gym and guest laundry are also available and I would recommend the rooftop seating area if you just want to 'chill' !Where it fell down for us ?.....we booked in the knowledge that there was a 'Happy Hour' serving beer and wine between 5pm and 7pm. Since making our booking this had been stopped and the hotel no longer even offers alcohol to purchase. What kind of hotel in NYC doesn't offer alcohol ??.......We purchased bottles of water from the lobby shop on our first day and got charged $7 !! The feeling of being ripped off is not a nice one and whilst I acknowledge businesses having to make a margin this was excessive. If you want water there is a 7 Eleven around the corner that has water at reasonable prices. The street the hotel is on appears to attract some 'odd' characters and I couldn't get to the bottom of why this was.

The room was quiet but one of the smallest in the hotel with an exceptionally small bathroom (4"" on one side of the wash bowl 3"" on the other). We asked to have a private car for 9am the next morning. It didn't arrive so the hailed a taxi ""to save us money""? House keeping seems to forget a few things each day and does not vacuum the floors. Much to our surprise this Homewood Suites hotel has a salad bar for its 5 to 7 evening get together but no snacks, beer or wine on Mondays through Thursday PM. I believe this is a test market for urban areas so before you book a Homeroom Suites hotel you might want to inquire if they are also taking away this special perk from your hotel which makes Homewood more like a Hampton inn or their competition. The strongest part of this hotel is the front desk that go out of their way to make you feel special. Assistant Mgr. Nafeesa Brent, Tiarra and Michael V were the highlight of our visit.

Rooms are huge and some comes with a nice skyscraper views like mine did including:---Huge bathroom for New York standards---A sofa with a small cushioned table---Long desk table with leather rolling computer chair---Lobby area has adequate areas for group gatherings including several sports TV---22nd floor is their rooftop view which at night has partial view of NYC.Shortcomings:---Handicap bathroom lacks counter space---No place to put clean towels and instead, they use the Handicap shower chair.---Very small closet. This can be a deal breaker if you are staying for a longer duration.Closet also cannot accommodate long dress or even hanging pants straight down from the hanger.--Table top ironing board instead of stand alone---Breakfast was just okay. And for the size of the property, I experience no place to sit due to the lack of tables and chairs during peak breakfast hours.---Elevators can be slow especially during peak time.Personal experience:1. I think one of my biggest disappointment was when I first checked in. I informed the guest service gentleman that I am a Hilton HHonors member and that if he wouldn't mind adding my membership for this property. I also requested nicely if I could please have a bottle water as I was extremely thirsty after a long flight from San Francisco. I was requested to purchase the water instead. 2. I called Hilton HHonors once I got in my room and they were able to add my membership over the phone with no problem. Laura from Hilton HHonors customer service also said I should have no problem now getting my complimentary bottled water. Not a big deal, but I travel almost every week for work and my company is exclusive with Hilton properties, and this is the first time I've experienced this type of inconvenience.While the gentlemen who checked me in said I wasn't able to use my Hilton HHonors membership, but interestingly enough, my coworker who checked in an hour after me, had no problem. Here's another interesting fact, we work for the same company who made the same booking. Maybe, the gentlemen who checked me in was having an off day. Either way, it left a very bad experience. I wrote down his name but I am leaving it out from this review and hope he will consider spending a few more seconds to provide a better customer experience. My advise to management is to please have a ONE communication with your staff so that extra few seconds with their customer interaction can be resolved quickly, without having to call Hilton HHonors. I do share my experience with my company, and they take note not just my experience, but my whole team's experience for future bookings which by the way, our whole team stayed at this property, and we were a large group.Cheers!","San Francisco, California","edwin_sfbay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",148,2.0

The breakfast was hot but barely palatable, and there is very limited room to sit unless you come early, as we did. By the time we finished our breakfast, people were clamoring for every available space in the front lounge area, by the elevators, etc. The building is also underserved by three elevators - the wait was always long, and elevators invariably crowded.

First of all, our room was kind of small -- and YES, I know we're talking NYC -- been staying in hotels there for years -- but was still surprised at the lack of space for a Homewood Suites. We were in town for 4 nights this time so had a small carry on with us. But there wasn't even enough room to be able to set up the luggage rack without it being in the middle of the ""walkway"" area of the room!However, after seeing some of the other traveler photos of similar rooms, I think we might have just had a ""bad luck of the draw"" based on our room's location possibly. Our room was located around the corner from the elevator kind of in a ""corner"" -- so maybe it was ""gypped"" a bit on space...??? I THOUGHT when I made the reservation I picked one with more square footage (vs. others that were listed)...so maybe we even ended up with the wrong room?? There was a nice desk area -- but then a large TV took up alot of space on it!! Would be nice if they'd consider mounting the TV on the wall! We did however love a little table that was in front of the couch that folded out into a larger table space -- which we used quite a bit.We had a wonderful, large window -- however it looked directly at a factory. We could see into the factory, so figured the workers could probably see into our room -- thus our blinds ended up being down ALL the time!! There was a wonderful rooftop deck area which we utilized and enjoyed! The lobby is beautiful -- but tended to be extremely crowded any time we came through. The breakfast area was nice as well but is long and narrow -- thus is not conducive to the large crowds that were present usually. The location of this hotel wasn't bad -- although we've stayed in better locations in NYC as far as subway access goes (but I knew this when we booked this hotel). The biggest issue though with this particular Homewood Suites was the lack of cleanliness!! There was dirt on the bathroom floor when we checked in, the frig door was filthy on the outside, and there was noticeable dust on the arms of the couch as well as on the light/fan (see pics). While I'd rate this hotel as ""very good"", and I'd consider staying here again, I'd definitely check into staying at the Hampton Inn Times Square North again FIRST -- the rooms were MUCH larger and multiple train lines were literally across the street!","Columbus, OH","traveler591</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, OH</strong>",33,4.0

It is located in a busy Manhattan high rise. The building is old, but the interior seems to be brand new. Our room was clean and all the furnishing and appliances were better than other Homewood Suites (slightly upgraded in my opinion). It has a roof top terrace and an indoor pool. Our room was smaller than other Homewood Suites, but it is still pretty large compared with other Manhattan hotels that we've stayed in the past. The breakfast area is quite hectic as there were a lot of guests when we stayed there, the food was refilled quickly (but not the cut fruits, which ran out both mornings that we had breakfasts there), but hard to find a place to sit. It is really not a big deal since this is Manhattan, space is always at a premium. The location is convenient if you are a tourist visiting NYC, but at the same time, it can be difficult to get around by a car due to the high volume of traffic. Again, this is not the hotel's fault, just something as a guest, you will need to decide if you want to be close to the action. The gym was small but functional and the roof top terrace was nice, but it was too hot for us to stay more than 5 minutes (there was a heat wave in NYC when we visited). All in all, we had a real good stay as the staff was very friendly (a nice change of pace from some of the other hotels in NYC). I would definitely recommend this place for a family (probably not that good for business travelers unless you are doing business in the NY Garment District, which is where this property is located at).","Rowland Heights, California","Albert C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rowland Heights, California</strong>",150,4.0

The rooms are small, but nicely arranged so they use space wisely. I think the bed and pillows were some of the most comfortable I've slept on in a hotel. The little compact kitchen area is a bonus and add to that their free breakfast as well as an evening meal during week nights and it really is a wonderful deal. The staff is nice, the hotel very clean and modern. It's not in the best area, but it's close to Penn Station which I found the easiest to navigate to and from different locations. Also, around the corner there's Sergimmo Salumeria for yummy sandwiches, Madman Espresso and Gregory's Coffee, also Capizzi's Pizza which we liked. I never heard any street noise during the night which is a bonus in a busy area. It's a short walk to Times Square, but luckily not right in it, which is a good thing.

Either the warmer doesn't work or it is kept at room temp until it is placed in the warmer. Evening (Monday-Thursday) - BIG disclaimer missing on website, hotel check in and in hotel room info. There is NO wine or beer at this location. This was the only asset to the evening events at this location since the food doesn't make sense and doesn't match what is listed on the calendar in the hotel rooms. We can say this because this is the second year we have stayed at this location. The first Monday no staff member could explain why there was no beer or wine for adults. All adults around our table stated that was the sole reason they booked this location as they enjoy it at other Homewood locations and were repeat customers at this location. On to the food selections and presentation. It would appear that either the person purchasing and/or deciding what food is purchased and served is either on a very strict budget and/or has no idea what foods grouped together would work well together. One example, HUGE bins of pulled pork not kept warm with nothing to flavor the dry shredded mass of meat, mostly left sitting full. You could either use the mayo packets or the blue cheese dressing single serve containers next to the veggies. Hint here, barbque sauce for the pulled pork AND Ranch dressing would be the most normal choice for the one solitary choice for veggies. And if budget is the reason for the mismatch, consider buying ranch dressing in bulk instead of single servings of Blue Cheese dressing. Minestrone soup and tortillnd a soup on Asian night? Hamburger sliders, but no buns or condiments? Nothing else to go with the sliders? Fries? A salad? The only drinks available all four nights were water, lemonade and apple juice. If you removed the adult beverages could you not spring for a small can of coke, coke zero.or sprite? Not in the budget? By Tuesday evening there was less than 15 people there. People looked and left with nothing, the hotel was nearly sold out. Why bother advertising and opening the room if you can't do it well. The Element owned by Westin two blocks over on 39th does it well and we'll be there again next year apologizing for not staying the last two years.","Houston, United States","Joe K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, United States</strong>",2,3.0

I could see why. The room was spotless. It was huge. We had a king size bed and a twin size pull-out couch. A full fridge, a desk, a table, an ottoman, tons of lights, a decent closet and bureau, and a fantastic kitchenette with a stove, sink, microwave, fridge, and dishwasher. Oh, and there were like 16 outlets in the room - enough for all of our electronics - ha ha. The hotel served an awesome free hot breakfast (and a happy hour each day M-Th where I was able to get a side salad.). While there were a lot of guests, the staff made sure the food was flowing and it was hot and delicious too. The cleaning staff made the room sparkle and were extremely polite. There wasn't a long wait for the elevators (there were 3) and they were fast, too. Although you didn't need a key card to get between floors, I wish it did - it's a security thing with me as far as safety. Dio the manager took care of us - he found a second room for us - we needed another room for just 2 nights due an unexpected friend who had to come into town due to a family emergency. The business center was busy but it was fabulous. You could send your documents over the internet to print (nothing sensitive of course). The workout center was full of clean machines and the laundry machines were quick and reasonable. I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat. The only complaint I had about the hotel was out of their control. At the corner of 8th and 37th street is a free WIFI station and the homeless/druggies hung out there to catch some free WIFI. It got difficult at times when they blocked the sidewalk or got a little boisterous. I found that crossing the street to avoid them did the trick. It's not something anyone could control, and these little WIFI spots are now stationed all over the city so the problem is not an isolated one.

Typically when we visit we stay in 4-star hotels right around Times Square, though we have also tried hotels in midtown. This time, though, given the very short stay, I wanted to find a less expensive hotel that was still good quality and walkable to the theater. I am pleased to report that Homewood Suites met and exceeded those objectives.This was my husband and my first time staying in a Homewood Suites property, and the New York location represents the brand very well. I tried it out because we have Hilton HHonors gold status, so I wanted to stay at a Hilton-family property if I could find a sufficiently good deal. This property's very high TripAdvisor ranking, really positive reviews, great location, sleek design, and surprisingly affordable rate caught my eye. The room was clean and attractive, and the bed was more comfortable than those I've experienced in a number of 4-star hotels in NYC and elsewhere. The sheets were luxuriously smooth -- they seemed to be a high thread count cotton sateen -- and the pillows were good quality. The self-serve breakfast was good, with nice touches like eggs scrambled with veggies (fresh broccoli and tomatoes or red peppers), red-skinned potatoes, beef sausage, and Sunkist raspberry lemonade, in addition to the more typical bagels, toast, cereal, fruit salad, etc. The hotel might consider adding protein-rich Greek yogurt (non-Greek light yogurt was available) and a self-serve waffle maker (though admittedly those can get a bit messy).The hotel personnel were so service-oriented that at checkout, with no prompting, they apologized and sought to make amends for a fire alarm that required displacement of guests the prior evening. I'm glad to have discovered this wonderful property and will stay there again. Thanks, TripAdvisor community, for the detailed and accurate positive reviews that prompted me to try it out. Thanks also to the Homewood Suites staff and management for making this hotel such a great value.",,Coastal184279,0,5.0

You have proximity to the theater scene, Times Square, the Hudson River, and lots more depending on how much you like to walk. Alternatives are taxis and, of course, the subway, which you'll have to walk to a few blocks away (not too bad, but the streets are crowded). The rooms are modern, very nice, and a good size by NYC standards. Considering you get a nice kitchen with a full fridge and microwave, it's really pretty rare in my NYC visiting experience. We had, I believe, a king bed and a pullout couch. Once the couch is expanded, it really takes up a lot of space, but still you could maneuver around pretty well and use the desk/chair with space and ease. Wifi was free. The TV was large. The detached closet was kind of small/cramped, with a rather unwieldy luggage rack stuffed in there. Our view was of a neighboring office building/alley, so while it wasn't exactly thrilling, it kept things very quiet. There were some ""next door neighbor"" type noises, but during our 8-night stay it wasn't too noticeable. The bathroom was a good size with room for our stuff and good water pressure in the shower. The perks include a full breakfast buffet (great for kids) with lots of options and a manager's reception that could double as dinner if you're lazy. That's pretty good for NYC. The exercise facility was top notch, though there's no pool. As far as customer service, I read a couple of complaints on here, but in eight days we had several very minor requests and all were handled expeditiously and very well, with one exception. One family member has a gluten allergy. This seemed to throw the food staff for a bit of a loop (odd considering it's fairly common these days). In the end they did try to accommodate, heading out to get some GF bagels and then providing info on GF options among the prepared food. So in the end everything was fine, though clearly the level of compliance varied depending on which staff member you talked to. No real surprise there. So all in all I would say the pros outweigh any minor cons in such a way that I would highly recommend this hotel, especially for a longer than normal stay.","State College, Pennsylvania","mdcawa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>State College, Pennsylvania</strong>",58,5.0

The only bakery items were bread and bagels. The bananas were all bruised. No waffles and no oatmeal to be found anywhere. The bacon looked unnatural and disgusting.2) The elevators appeared dysfunctional. We stayed on the 21st floor and lifts would come up to about floor 15 and then go down again.3) The noise in the room made sleep prohibitive. It wasn't the noise of New York, but their air system that constantly blows air through the vents, whether you have air conditioning on or not.4) The sofa bed was not even made up for our arrival, despite the fact we had a reservation for 3.As a HHonnors member, this was a clear 'fail' for this place.

It was a good size for a New York Hotel. Location is quite close to 34th street (Macys) and walking distance to the Empire State Building. Not a very desirable location. Expect lots of homeless near the hotel. They did not disturb us but a disturbing sight compared to those hotels nearby Times Square.Homewood Suites had a late check in at 4pm and difficult to get an early check in if you are arriving early. They will acomodate to store your luggage while you can go out shopping. Being a Hilton honors member does not make much difference to the treatment you will get if you are to request a late checkout. Late check out are available to 4pm with a fee of US$150.00. The staff are friendly but I found the Supervisors very strict about their late check out conditions despite we stayed for 4 nights and arrived late on the day of check-in. They were not prepared to extend our late checkout despite we booked the Airport transfers through the Hotel and we had a late long flight back home. I felt the Supervisors were trained to refuse late check out despite whatever circumstances. I did not find this same problem if I had stayed at Accor hotel or IHG group where complimentary late checkout were ready offered. Even offering to pay US$150 I was only given the option for late checkout maximum till 4pm. The Supervisors were not ready to budge with the timing even though the front desk at earlier offered till 6pm. Benefits of staying at this Hotel was a complimentary breakfast till 10.30am and free coffee, tea and hot chocolate offered all day at the Lobby. Room comes a full equipped kitchen but did not use it. The Hotel did not offer much view eventhough they had up to 20+ storey. The Double bed rooms were only offered till 6 storey. Our room faced the main street and it was not a great sight. Opposite were residential and office building. Laundry room available at basement level. It was not occupied and you could do Laundry for US$5.00 for both washer and drying separately. The use of the Computer and printer was useful for printing boarding pass. Overall good experience staying at the Homewood Suites if only the Supervisors can communicate the rules on the late check out in a better manner than giving an excuse that they do not have any cleaners after 4pm so we need to pay for a full rate if we decide to extend anytime after 4pm. I guess this is my 1st time hearing this reason to deter customers from late checkout. I would not stay in a Hotel next time when I have a late flight which does not accomodate late check out even with the option of storing luggage. I definitely need a shower before leaving to the Airport after last minute shopping. I made a mistake and should have booked for 5 nights instead of 4 nights and the additional night rate would have been US$200.00 or lower depending on the period. I thought I would be given the late check out option but it was frustrating negotiating with staff who refuse to give guest the flexibility for a late checkout.","Singapore, Singapore","theresasg17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",4,3.0

Powdered eggs, some hot plate items and cold plate selections. Guests even come down in their pajamas. Seating inside and in the lobby area for the overflow.

So be careful of your time, if you are departing the hotel with more than one piece of luggage.Suite had a modern design with parquet flooring. Our room faced the street and the lux condos.

Location was great - a short walk to Bryant Park, Penn Station, Times Square and the theaters. But the staff and the service was even greater!From the moment I walked through the doors I was greeted by the friendly front desk agent. He checked me in quickly so that I could get to my room and make it to my dinner that I was running late for. Breakfast was busy with guests but it was always fully stocked with food and the fruit was fresh (not brusied or overripe) on both days I was there. My room was quiet, nicely decorated and clean. I love the floor to ceiling windows! How they fit a kitchenette, a pull out couch, foot rest, desk, armoire and bed into a NYC hotel room and still make it feel like you have so much space is amazing. Front desk was attentive and helpful with directions. Housekeeping did a great job cleaning my room and stocking me with amenities and the public areas always looked clean.

The location for public transport is great, not far from penn st station and the port authority. That has its downside as there are a lot of homeless people and people with mental health issues nearby. We never had a problem with them but it could be off putting for some. Check in was very efficient and we had a very clean room on the 21st floor complete with mini kitchen which was great forange supplies for the room. Elevators were fast and breakfast good, they even end put snacks on Monday to Thursday with free beer and wine. I paticulary liked the 24/7 tea and coffee in the lobby. All public spaces were spotless and staff friendly and efficient. I've heard a lot how people in NYC can be rude but that wasn't the case here or anywhere else in the city.

We were disappointed when we walked in the room and saw how small it was. We stay in Manhattan about 1x a year and this was the smallest room we've stayed in. The was no bath & no sofa that you see in many of the pictures. There really wasn't a space to put your bags. There is a luggage rack provided but using it would block entrance to/from the room & bathroom. There was a desk, 3 large drawers & an armoire, however this was where the iron/board is stored. There is a little space to put coats in. There's a small shower. The seal on the shower was bad & each morning there was a puddle on the bathroom floor. There was no fan to turn on in the bathroom. There was a white powder on the bed that got on our clothes. The people that worked in housekeeping were very nice, always friendly. Continental breakfast of small bagels, fruit, cereal, potatoes & quiche with spinach and meat were provided each morning & Monday through Thursday from 5-7 P.M. a small dinner buffet was available for no additional cost. This includes 2 wine & 2 beer options. I thought the kitchenette would be nice to have but we didn't end up using it at all. I had brought a few food items but there wasn't much room in the cabinets to place them. They are filled with plates & cutlery. The fridge is empty with a lot of room. There is a nice roof deck & you can take food & drinks (including alcohol) up to. I did use the laundry. You need $5 in quarters ($2.50 washer/$2.50 dryer) and your own detergent which could be purchased at the front desk for $3.75/load. You need your room key to access the laundry area.Overall the room/accommodations were sufficient/fine but I would not have spent $300./night + $185. in fees + $40./day for parking had I not thought it would be an excellent stay.",New York,"Colleen_QZ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",16,3.0

Manca solo lo scolapasta. Evitate di portarvi la pasta dall'Italia perchè a 5 minuti a piedi c'è un grosso market pieno di prodotti italiani, dalla Barilla alla Levissima, trovate tutto a prezzi modici. Posizione fantastica a 2 passi dalla metro e da Time Square, si raggiunge tutto a piedi. Se desiderate il taxi per JFK vi consiglio di prenotarlo il gg prima per evitare inutili attese (costo fisso 65$). In un letto possono dormire tranquillamente 2 persone. Bagno ampio. Ottima pulizia. C'è tutto dal phon alla sveglia. Consigliatissimo specie per noi italiani. 3 ascensori veloci. Colazione inclusa. le camere vengono fatte verso le 14, tenetelo presente. Ampia fornitura di asciugamani puliti tutti i giorni. Wifi gratuito veloce e sempre disponibile. Ottimo soggiorno, ci torneremo. Great hotel at 5 minutes walk from Times Square .

Do not bring the pasta from Italy because at 5-minute walk there is a big market full of Italian products, from Barilla to Levissima , you find everything at reasonable prices . Fantastic location, just 2 steps from the metro and from Time Square , you can reach everything on foot . If you want the taxi to JFK I recommend you book it the day before to avoid unnecessary waiting time (fixed cost $ 65) . In a bed 2 people can sleep peacefully . Large bathroom . Good cleaning. There is everything from hairdryer to the alarm . Highly recommended especially for us Italians . 3 fast lifts . Breakfast included. The rooms are cleaned at 2 p.m., keep this in mind .

I searched for a Homewoods, mostly because that's the only hotel myself and family usually stay in. It's a go to because they accommodate you and really make you feel like you're at home. At this particular location, the staff was on top of everything. They were very helpful, courteous, and greeted you with a smile on their face. They even asked did me and my brother need a taxi or an uber called for our night out. We booked an efficiency and even though it was a small space, they worked their magic and made it look so spacious. The decor was amazing, very modern looking; and the room was very clean...top to bottom. And the location! It wasn't that far from Times Square, Penn Station, Hell's Kitchen and the theater district.

I suppose our trip (pre cruise for 3 days) was blighted by bad weather from the off, but I have tried to be objective in my views.One of our reasons for preferring the Homewood (and in general - Hilton brands) is the comfort of the beds, which in this case didn't live up to expectations, so a slight de-merit there.Other than the beds, not much to complain about as long as you don't want to do anything but cardio or dumbells in the ""fitness centre"". The free breakfast is pretty standard fare but as a heavily booked hotel, finding seating and getting at the food on offer is chaotic, although the staff do work hard at clearing tables and replenishing the food, so other guest and not the staff are the cause of the chaos.The evening manager's reception is worth a swerve unless you like salty nibbles and free beer or wine - don't expect it to be your evening meal.Housekeeping are on the ball, with no cause for complaint. The room (a twin bed studio was not well blessed with storage, so we lived pretty much out of a suitcase - and wardrobe (as such) in the bathroom? Where did that idea come from?Location is a little hard to categorise - calling it ""Times Square"" is being a bit free with geography, and because of the weather, getting about on foot wasn't very pleasant.

For those on a budget or tired after a long day of meetings or sightseeing, the free dinner is a nice touch.I enjoyed heading up to the rooftop deck on the 22nd floor. It was nice to sit outside, read, soak up some sun and enjoy the views of the city.Service was friendly, professional and helpful. Whenever I ran into staff in the hallways or elevator, they made it a point to say hello and smile.

This is a very nice, new, clean property. As with any NYC hotel, the rooms are much smaller than other properties in the chain. Our room had a king bed, love seat, large ottoman, desk with chair, and a kitchenette that ran about 4 feet along one wall. The bathroom had a large shower (no tub) and a sink with very limited counter space to spread out toiletries. Most Homewood Suites have a table near the kitchenette big enough for two people to eat at. Here the ""table"" was between the love seat and ottoman and folded out to perhaps 18""x24"". So this is bigger than a typical NYC hotel room and okay for one person, but it's not really designed for a couple to stay in and eat in longer term. The small size compared to other Homewood properties is the only reason I'm bumping my rating down to 4 stars.The lobby area is large and comfortable by NYC hotel standards, with comfy seating and a gas-burning fireplace. You can be comfortable here if your room isn't ready when you arrive. The complementary breakfast has a nice selection of hot and cold items. We did not participate in the manager's reception, but it was popular and offered a light meal.The staff was very friendly and helpful. There's a ""pantry"" next to the reception desk selling a variety of snacks and beverages. There's also a 7-11 around the corner.The location is great--about a 6-minute walk to Madison Square Garden/Penn Station (and the closest subway stop is there) and about a 10-15-minute walk to the Theater District, depending on exactly where you're headed there. It's in the middle of the Fashion District, and it's always fun to window shop while you're walking by. There are plenty of restaurants within a couple of blocks.

The quality of the food was good and we had not known this was going to be available so was a very nice surprise!! The only downside which was not the fault of the hotel but the concierge which is not run by the Hilton - we went to buy theatre tickets through them and paid $40 each ticket over the original ticket price but I had specifically said I would not want side seats as have a problem with my neck and those seats affect me. The girl on concierge phoned the agency, explained the situation and was assured that would be fine. I must have repeated 6 times I would not be prepared to pay an extra 50% over and above the ticket price for side seats and she assured me this would not be a problem but when we went to collect the tickets at 7pm needless to say they were side seats and I was gutted!! The concierge girl said the following day this has happened a few times where requested tickets were not fulfilled so just beware if you book as they only confirm as best available and they won't do anything about it afterwards. I really wouldn't recommend this facility unless you are happy to pay over the odds and sit absolutely anywhere in the theatre.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","Brenda A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",85,4.0

We had a King EFF STUDIO-CTY VW and we were on the 20th floor I was travelling with a 12 year old. Our room was extremely comfortable and roomy enough that we were able to unpack our cases and live out of the cupboard and drawer space provided. We stored our suitcases under the workstation which meant we didn't lose floor space due to luggage. Being on the 20th floor meant we had no issue getting an elevator however during the breakfast peak we often stopped at 10 floors even though we were full and no one else could fit. The hotel has 3 elevators which are used by staff and guests. There was some street noise but certainly none that caused us any problems. Our room was right next to the lifts and once again this didn't cause us any problems. Breakfast is provided complimentary each day. With a choice of 4 cereals and oatmeal, toast, bagels, yoghurt, fruit, apple and orange juice and a selection of something hot. They had different selection each day sometimes scrambled eggs, omelets, bacon, French toast, turkey sausages or egg and cheese muffins. The rooms are serviced each day and they use Neutrogena products. There is no turn down service, not that we would have used it anyway but some people do like that. We found the staff very pleasant and helpful and we would definitely stay again if we were to return to New York. We did have one problem and it did put a fairly major negative on our final day. Because of the hotels policy of putting multiple holds on your cards during your stay I was left with no money on my prepaid card and unable to access cash. The hotel had been informed that I was using a prepaid card and given the details of a credit card they could use for holding funds. An option they chose not to use so left me in a predicament on the last day. I was extremely vigilant and queried the practice a number of times, each time being advised by staff that it really would not be a problem. Until it was and it became my problem.

This was my first stay at the Homewood Suites. It's in a great location half-way between Penn Station and Times Square. The rooms are quite spacious for Manhattan. I loved that they aren't carpeted (they have those vinyl planks that look like hardwood). I also appreciated the walk-in shower and the desk with a separate table that rolled out and was the perfect height for using a laptop. I paid extra for a city view room; I don't think it was worth the extra money because all you see are the buildings across the street - not much of a view.I would have given the hotel an excellent rating, but a couple of things stopped me. One was the free meals. Breakfast was OK, but every morning, the hot items were empty. Fortunately, the oatmeal is very good. One evening, they served pork bratwurst with no other options. That's OK if you eat pork and meat, but it not, your only option was soup (which had meat) or a basic salad bar. The other thing I didn't like about the hotel was the scratchy towels. I mean really rough. I've been to lower end hotels that had better towels. Maybe they need to find a new laundry or use some fabric softener?I'm on the fence as to whether or not I'll be back.

Then just a 3 block walk.The hotel lobby is stylish and spacious, the welcome was gracious, I wish I had noted the ladies name as she was by far the best member of staff we encountered over the week. It made a great start to the holiday.People have complained about the size of the rooms, however being New York, rooms are smaller. That being said, our room on the 15th floor was spacious and well equipped. The bed was comfy, the duvet was lacking somewhat and extremely small not even covering the whole bed which was pretty poor. There was enough storage space for two people to unpack their luggage and store it without getting in the way which was great. Both the kitchenette and bathroom were clean and well appointed. The only 'dirty' thing in the room was the sofa which was extremely dusty as I found out after sitting on it! The room, at the front of the hotel, had a fantastic view of the street which made the room feel light with the full size window. Air con and heating both worked well. A real bonus of the hotel was the food, breakfast I can not understand how people can say it is limited as for an included breakfast there was both a great selection as well as variety in what was offered each day. It was busy each morning but there was always a table available. Additionally the evening food on Monday to Thursday evenings was good for a bite to eat to keep you going until supper or for as a light dinner. We took this up to our room to eat whilst getting ready to go out for the evening.The staff, although we didn't really have much to do with them, were hit and miss, two were absolutely brilliant I wish I remembered their names whereas one lady was pretty abrupt/rude even going by what is standard for New York. However that being said I wouldn't hesitate staying at the hotel again it was a fantastic base for New York and I would throughly recommend asking for a high room, it often seemed that the lower floor people (below floor 10) struggled for the lifts as they were full by the time they reached their floors on the way down.

She likes it when breakfast is handy, better if it's in the hotel and it's included. We all know how expensive hotel breakfasts can be. The room also comes equipped with a fridge and mini-kitchen set up - perfect if you're staying several days.We got a great price booking directly with Hilton (I'm a gold member) and using AAA discount. We paid around $217. However, this week when the car show was in, it was showing $280/nt. So watch for that.I have to give the hotel kudos for it's breakfast. For someone like me who travels and generally stays in the chains, especially for their quickie easy to access breakfasts, they get tiring fast. By day 2 I'm usually onto cereal only. However, they changed the menu each day, enough so that there was a variety.On the whole it was very good.To add to this, Mon-Thursday, they offer free wine and beer along with a light meal. We used it twice and it is a really nice touch and very popular.The hotel is easy to get to via subway, Penn Station is your best route and more importantly it is near Time Square but not next to it. The glaring lights and activity is fun to experience but not so much when you want a bit of R&R and some shut eye. Also a short walk to the theatre district.The rooms are a bit small (who cares when you're in NYC) and nicely designed. Plugs for all those nice electronic gizmos we carry are plentiful and easy to reach (desk level, not hands and knee level). There is a walk in shower, not tub which I much prefer. It was a hit with my wife, so I guess it's a hit with me (to be honest, I liked it too).","Fredericton, Canada","coachboon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fredericton, Canada</strong>",59,5.0

We were not disappointed! The staff on arrival were friendly and helpful which was a positive start. Our room 513 was very spacious with 2 queen beds and small kitchen and seating area. It was nicely furnished and more importantly immaculately clean. The housekeeping staff were excellent. It was also quiet and we slept soundly each night. There were 3 elevators to service all floors but we never waited more than a few minutes. The breakfast in the morning set us off nicely for the day. Some reviews I read said it wasn't a great choice of breakfast but it's free and we found it to be ample choice. There was cereal, fruit, yogurt, croissants and cooked breakfast options changed daily but always included eggs, sausage, potatoes or hash browns etc. Something for everyone and coffee/tea/hot chocolate was available 24 hours in the lobby. It was difficult to get a table to eat breakfast one morning but I think as it was Easter Sunday everyone decided to go to breakfast at the same time. The terrace on the 22nd floor provided some great views so worth trying out. The location was fantastic with Times Square, Empire State, Rockefeller Centre, Bryant Park, Madison Square Garden, Grand Central Station all within 10 minutes walking distance. 34th street also provides great shopping with the world largest Maceys store as well as others. We took the AirTrain from JFK to Jamaica Station then the Long Island Railroad train to Penn Station which is a couple of blocks from the hotel and 5-10 minutes to walk to the hotel from the station. There's also a couple of nice supermarkets to stock up on essentials just found the corner although the hotel had a little shop for anything you might need. We would have no hesitation recommending this hotel to friends and family visiting NYC and will definitely be back.

The room itself was relatively spacious and had a nice kitchenette; there were four of us in the room (2 adults, 2 teens) so after a week it felt a bit cramped with all of our luggage. We had some problems with the staff though; every time I called in the evening for extra towels because they hadn't replaced the number we'd used, I would get a recording and have to leave a message. Then I would call the front desk and they'd have someone come up, but they were never particularly friendly. More to the point, I was expecting a FedEx package with valuable contents, and had given the staff at the desk a heads up, but no one called to let us know when it arrived and it wasn't until I called the next day to inquire that they finally realized they had it, and that was only after a long search. As for the food, the free afternoon happy hour was ok but limited in terms of food, and the breakfasts, though included with the room rate, got boring after a while and the room was mobbed with people. I didn't think the layout of the space was conducive to handling crowds. Tip: We bought cases of drinks from a wholesaler we discovered by chance down the street and kept them in the fridge since we were out and about a lot during the day and didn't want to pay NYC prices for single bottles.

I am a very light sleeper, too!! However, I will say our neighbors (connecting door) were loud and on different time zone!! Next time I will call ahead and try not to get a room with connecting door if possible. I complained to front desk around midnight when my husband and I notice cigarette smoke smell! Front desk responsive and followed up on issue right away. They offered to move our room if we wanted the next day. That night we placed a towel at the bottom of the the connecting door...since we could see lights were on and there is an inch gap from floor to bottom of door. Would be good if they put a rubber door sweep at the bottom of all the connecting doors. Elevators were not as slow as the previous reviews I had read which is why I choice a room on 4th floor (worried about elevator). My girls often wanted to go up to the 22nd floor roof top and we never had issue with long wait. Workout area is nice and clean. The laundry next door to work out and it looked very clean; you could work out and be close to your laundry if needed. Front desk staff always responsive and professional!!

Located on 37th between 8th and 9th, it's a great venue for a number of the key sightseeing locations being only a short walk from Times Square, the Empire State Building. Madison Square Garden and Broadway and Penn subway station. The room we were assigned (1004) was modern and spacious and included a king size bed plus a kitchenette, dish washer and large fridge-freezer and a desk plus a small settee and foot stool. The bed was comfortable. The room had aircon plus an overhead fan,The view was over the street. Not sure if there were any better views from other rooms.The staff were always friendly and helpful.Breakfast is available from 6 to 1030am each day. We were able to get a table for breakfast with ease between 7 and 8am though it was very busy at weekends between 9am and 10am. The food and drink is on a buffet basis. As a result, and has been our experience in a number of countries, the ""hot"" food was often only lukewarm. The hot food was usually: 1 tray egg based - always with cheese; 1 tray - bacon or sausage or corn beef hash; 1 tray - potato based - often hash browns.On Monday to Thursdays between 5pm and 7pm, the hotel provided complimentary beer and wine with some complimentary snacks (pretzels, nuts etc) and 3 ""hot"" trays. Each evening had a theme for the hot food eg pasta 1 evening; sliders on another evening; oriental on another evening. The above comment re the temperature of the hot food was again our only criticism.Complimentary coffee and hot water (with a variety of tea bags) is available adjacent to the restaurant 24x7. Complimentary wifi was available in the room and in the public areas we visited in the hotel and was consistently a good strength.We were able to agree a complimentary check out time of 1pm. It would have been USD50 up to 230pm and USD150 after that.

I wouldn't say I didn't like it, but there are a couple things I'd want to point out to future guests. There are definitely some good things, mixed in with a few things I didn't particularly care for.The hotel and our room was very clean. That is a major plus! Even with heavy traffic through the lobby, they really kept it nice! The free coffee bar in the lobby was a great plus! The coffee was very good and they had a variety of creamers and such. A nice touch. Our bed was so comfy! It was terrific to lay down after 4 full days of walking, walking and more walking around the city. The hotel was located in great proximity to Times Square, Madison Sq Garden, Penn Station and the subway. There are a few NY Gift stores located on the corner of the street. We also really liked the floor to ceiling windows in our room! A few of the things I didn't particularly care for was that the food (both breakfast and dinner reception) wasn't very good. Unfortunately, I would have to say below average. It was great they offered these free dining options for their guests, but with the food being sub par, I didn't care to go get some. It was nice they did offer 2 beers on tap and wine with the evening reception. The food didn't have much taste, the vegetables were very old looking and my husband saw some mold on the cheese platter. In our room, I was disappointed we didn't get a small couch as shown in all the photos. I was very happy with the kitchenette, but having the couch would have been nice for a seating area and we could have used the unfolding table. One last thing that really bothered my husband, more than myself is that the vent in the wall for the heating/cooling blew right on top of us when we were sleeping all night. I usually like sleeping with a fan, but that can easily be turned on and off. This was constant blowing.Overall, it's a nice place, but personally I wouldn't count on having full meals here. It was a great price for NY and was very nice to have the kitchenette, coffee bar and friendly staff. I would say a 7 out of 10.

This property was about a half mile away and had great ratings on tripadvisor so that made it an easy decision.I'm a Hilton guy and tend to be a fan of Homewood Suites. I find they typically provide excellent service with nice amenities in the rooms. This property delivered and met my expectations of the typical Homewood Suites experience.The only thing that was abnormal was that we booked a double queen room. About a week and a half out from our stay I checked our reservations on hilton.com and noticed that we were issued a wheelchair accessible room. Since my business partner and I are both over 6'3 we don't typically like these rooms because the showers usually have a bench (that takes up room) and the showerhead is usually very low. So I requested that we be put in a regular room and not an accessible one. I was instantly told ""no"" and that's basically it. Seems kind of odd that we were automatically assigned an accessibility room with no hope of a room adjustment when I'm calling a few weeks before the event. To be fair, it may have something to do with the New York Toy Fair room block that we purchased in. I wasn't told of anything specific, but since I didn't book on hilton.com like I usually do, maybe that's why I got the cold shoulder.The breakfasts were good and I would advise not waiting until the last 20-30 minutes before breakfast ends. Because it was a madhouse with people all over the place. It's NYC and something you deal with, but wow.. pretty chaotic. Food was pretty well stocked and staff provided good service.I would stay at this hotel again if I return for New York Toy Fair. It's nice having the kitchenette with the large fridge and etc... The rooms had relatively new furnishings and were pretty trendy for Homewood Suites.Give this a look if you're going to be around TImes Square or need to be close to the Javits Center.","Mattawan, Michigan","TheGameCrafter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mattawan, Michigan</strong>",58,5.0

As luck would have it (or maybe it happens a lot), I chose a room, only to receive an email the next day that I could not have that room and another was chosen for me. While they did assign a room with my special request to not be near the elevators, it was a waste of time to try to pick myself. Granted, there is a caveat that you may not get the room, but they tease you with the ability to do so.Likes - great value for NYC, clean and comfortable room, courteous and professional staffDislikes - the free breakfast is mediocre at best and tough to find seating at the peak hours (although this is no different than most chain hotels), the room doors are extremely loud when closing (even when being careful), and the ice machine is smack dab in the middle of the hallway. If you are like our family, and don't stay out too late/go to bed early, the last two may be problematic for you. You can't close the doors softly, even if you try. It's the way the locks are. As such, you may wake to your neighbors door. Also, apparently to save space for revenue generating rooms, the ice machine is in the middle of the hallway, built into a wall, near the elevators. In most hotels, it is placed within a room with perhaps vending machines to alleviate potential noise. Although we were at the end of the hallway, which is not very long, we could still hear people using the ice machine. We were on the third floor, and I assume that every floor is set-up the same.Recommendations for those liking quiet - to best stay away from the elevators, ice machine and most used stairwell, I recommend you staying at the end of the hall with the numbers ending in 14 or 16, or the odd numbers across the way. There is a stairwell there, but that leads to the outside, so won't be used as much as the other end, which leads to the lobby (rooms ending in 02 or 04, or the odd rooms across the way). If you have your choice, choose the rooms ending with 14 or 16. Just be advised that the early check-in with a room selection is probably a gimmick only. So make a request for those rooms ending with 14 or 16, or the odd numbers across the way. The second best is rooms ending in 02 or 04 or the odd rooms across the way.On another note - the garage is located conveniently across the street, but be aware that this is not an easy in or out of the garage - the vehicle is parked by a valet and buried in the abyss with other cars. If you want to retrieve something from your vehicle, expect to dole out some doe to tip they guy to bring you to the car, and when you want the car, you'll wait with others while the valet gets same, resulting in a wait and more doe. I also abhor handing my keys over to a valet, not knowing how the vehicle is being jammed in somewhere.All in all you can't go terribly wrong here, but it's not worthy of an excellent rating in my opinion.","Manchester, NH","NCHS80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, NH</strong>",77,4.0

We've just woken up on our second morning and feel abnormally ill and blocked up. It's clearly down to the room as we have been fine when we're out but this room leaves you incredibly blocked up. I've had to take tablets to decongest myself, not what you want first thing every morning!We booked a family room, we were obviously able to choose our room; however, if there is a small child in the room it should be noted that when the pull out sofa bed is made, the room is very very small. It doesn't look this small online and I think the pictures are very deceptive. It was also not made up on our arrival and when it was made up we were made to wait until 11pm until we had any bedding sent to the room. There is also no bath tub so bear this in mind when travelling here with small children.The room is beautifully decorated whilst very compact and also very clean (our maid is fantastic), staff very helpful, free breakfast is useful.Without a shadow of a doubt this is worth 5 stars on tripAdvisor, but when you are ill when in your room and when you can barely get out of bed because of the sofabed it does knock off some points! Customers should be informed that if the sofabed is being used its not practical to be classified as a family room.Such a shame as really could be perfect.

I stayed at Homewood Suites for four nights in February on a business trip, and found the location to be very convenient - it was walking distance to the Javitts Center (took about 10 - 15 minutes), as well as Times Square, Penn Station, the subway, etc. The room on the larger side for New York hotel room standards, and was clean and very comfortable. It had a large flat screen TV, comfy king bed, desk, sofa, and came with a kitchenette area with a good-sized fridge, stove top, microwave, dishwasher, sink, coffeemaker and was well stocked with plates, utensils, glassware, cookware, etc. As a Hilton Gold member, I was given free bottled water and cookies upon arrival. Breakfast is included 7 days a week, and dinner is included M - Th in the hotel's lobby restaurant area. The food was pretty basic, but I appreciated the convenience of not to having to venture out into the cold to get something to eat. There is also a coffee/tea/hot chocolate bar available in the lobby 24/7, and free wi-fi. All of the employees I came into contact with were extremely pleasant, helpful and polite. The lobby area has a modern feel with a fireplace and a giant waterfall feature on the wall. I heard that there is a rooftop terrace, but considering how cold it was in NY while I was there, I never checked it out. The only issue I had was that the heat/air system in the room was a little too loud, but at least it was a consistent, steady sound (like loud white noise). However, it was nothing that earplugs couldn't fix. Overall, I really liked this hotel, and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to New York City.

I spoke to the manager and he had the same attitude. Very cold hearted people. I have traveled often and know what hospitality is. Anyway, the staff at this location (37th and 8th) was VERY rude. Every single person, not just one, had a sentiment of hostility when you approached the person. From the manager to the common front desk worker. I was paying for the room. It wasn't a gift or for free. My company did not pay for it. I paid for it myself with my own money. If these people really hate their jobs, they should quit. I have no clue who is managing that branch but corporate needs to go there incognito and witness the anger they hold inside and how they talk to their guests with the attitude they carry. Too bad they represent a premier brand. This is not a corner joint hotel/shack. There were other problems with the hotel. It was clean which is a good thing but the blanket was way too thin and too narrow in its width for two people to share. The room also had heating problems as the hvac did not work properly.

The refrigerator in our room made a terrible noise, but the staff immediately responded when notified and was willing to remove and replace it right away. We stayed on the 17th floor and only had issues with crowded elevator 1 time and that was Sunday during peak breakfast time. All other times it was not an issue at all.

It's very close to the time square area and within walking distance of the Empire State, Rockefeller, Central Park (probs 30 mins) and more. Arrived at hotel at 3pm and was able to check in straight away. Good size room, huge bed and massive TV. All amenities in room, apart from a kettle so was unable to make tea, although I'm sure they could have provided one if I'd asked. Made great use of the complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby which you help yourself to. I wasn't expecting much from breakfast after reading previous reviews and thought we'd maybe only have it a couple of times but ended up having it every day as it was great. Always meat, egg and potato options, bagels, muffins, cereal etc. Great choice. Only had difficulty getting a seat on one occasion so ended up taking it to our room. Was able to avoid high data roaming charges by using the free wifi which was very fast.

First, they were running an hour late for check in due to housekeeping. The guys at the desk were very nice and offered drinks to us and the kids while we waited. That said, there was A LOT of people waiting, many people standing. My room on the 5th floor wasn't ready so they moved me to the 4th floor. I prefer higher when in NY due to street traffic. Luckily, it's not on a main road so we only heard honking once or twice. We get to our room and the keys won't work. So I have to go back and get another set of keys made. Finally get in the room and it's nice. It has a ceiling fan, which earns big points with me. The AC is working great, another good sign. Actually it was freezing my friend and her daughter because it blows on the bed closest to the window. They are used to it being warmer so I didn't sleep well. I'm not a fan of the closet being inside the bathroom. Who thought that was a good use of space? I don't mind bringing my clothes into the bathroom if I want privacy. The thing I really didn't like was the bathroom door slides shut, but does not latch or lock! And is not close to being soundproof. :-P Seriously think of a hanging door just closing over the opening. The vent fan in the bathroom wasn't working that we could tell. I forgot to tell management about that now that I think of it. There is very little space in the bathroom for your toiletries. There are buttons on the top of the toilet tank to use to flush so forget sitting anything there. The sink area is very narrow and the only other shelving is the area where the medicine cabinet would be has narrow shelves. They could have done a little better I think with that. The room is meant for up to 4 people, but they only had towels for 3. Had to request more towels. Next day they took the used towels even thought they were not on the floor. Breakfast was crazy, no seating available at 9am (breakfast ends at 10am). We stood to eat, which I have never had to do in a hotel. For 45 minutes there were no seats available. Granted it was a holiday weekend, but so not worth a free meal. I thought they had a waffle maker and they did not so the kids were disappointed. Next day we were leaving and stopped for breakfast on the way home. Again, the hotel was nice, but we've stayed at nicer in the city. It was close to the train, which is why I booked there, but then we ended up driving and I was unable to change my reservation by then. There is a parking lot just up the street since the hotel does not have valet parking. You might get lucky and find street parking. What was nice is how centrally located the hotel was. Usually we stay closer to Times Square and it takes longer to get places. This was a little closer to the areas we wanted to go. Also, I'm a Hilton Honors member so I had free Wi-Fi.","Warrenton, Virginia","JenCinVA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warrenton, Virginia</strong>",44,3.0

From JFK it was 45 mins by train costing all of $13 each to Penn Station (Madison Square Garden), far better than an expensive taxi. Less than a 5 minute walk we were at the hotel. We were greeted with a smile which always helps by Nafeesa who after a few mins conversation realised it was my 40th Birthday the next day. She didn't have to but kindly gave us an upgrade to a room with a balcony. She explained where everything was in the hotel so we felt at ease. Getting to the room (805 8th floor) we were presented with an immaculately cleaned room with kitchenette. Then we noticed the balcony, how nice was this to have our own patio. Was like sitting in our own garden back at home. We then decided to leave and venture around Times Square which was between 5-10mins away. The highlight of the stay was when we got back from our day out on my birthday to find a bottle of wine, 2 cakes, decoration on the window, a card and some other treats on the table. Nafeesa had made the effort to put this into our room and I have to honestly say, the service we receive on our Vegas trips in 5 star hotels hadn't matched up to this so was appreciative of the gesture. So a massive thank you to all staff especially Nafeesa for making my 40th birthday something we will not forget, secondly the staff in the breakfast area, constantly tidying up which we felt mean leaving our plates so we put these away ourselves each time. Just a bit annoyed we never got to say bye to Nafeesa.

So I have visited to Homes2 by Hilton (Long Island City), Residence Inn by Marriott (Central Park and Eastside), Staybridges Suites Times Square and Dumont hotel.This Homewood Suites Times Square is my least favorite of them all.Cons: The kitchenette is not separated from the sleeping area so it is very odd.The room is smaller than all the hotels previously mentioned. The cleanliness is just ok (hair from previous customers on towels and around sink, bathroom,shower, kinda gross!) ...I even had to request another room from the previously allocated one because the floor was dirty,dusty and full of hair.The towels were worn out, ""beige""-ish and some torn...really at a Hilton?Pros: Nice and understanding staff. Modern room. Fully equipped kitchen. Safe and busy location. Request a higher floor though (above floor 15) or you'll get zero view or a view inside the apartment right across the window!Free Breakfast AND dinner (yessss!). Great for families or long stays.In this style of hotel, I would choose the Residence Inn Central Park (brand new) or Staybridges Suites TSquare over this one. Period.

The check in process at 2.00am in the morning was quick and welcoming. The highlight of the stay was the play area. It helped our two year old son to acclimatize to the new environment. He met and played with many new friends his age from all over the world. This simple feature made parenting during the trip so much easier and more enjoyable. We strongly recommend that the hotel keeps a play area as a part of its year round offerings. The other features we deeply appreciated included the 24 hour laundry, the extremely quick internet service, the built in kitchen (even though we didn't cook) the windows that could open and the evening dinners provided by the Hotel. The Hotel is centrally located major all the conveniences and within walking distance of the major transportation options. It was so easy to walk or even travel by taxi, bus or train. The rooms are sound proof so you don’t hear the external sounds and heating and the a/c works well. Homewood Suites has earned the right to include the word ""Home"" in its name. The staff were instrumental to the fantastic experience we had and we deeply appreciate it.

The location is great because it is close to Times Square, close to Madison Square Garden, and two blocks from two different subway stations. We traversed much of Manhattan during our visit and this hotel/location was excellent. I wish I could say more about the staff but without a doubt it was the best hotel staff I've ever encountered. They must have been under enormous stress given the hotel was fully occupied during Christmas. Tons of people but the staff repeatedly attended to our every need in a timely manner with a gracious smile. This speaks volumes for the their training program. The staff was highly motivated and trained to make their guests have a wonderful experience. Our room was great, all of these are suites with a kitchenette, again, great for traveling. I will repeat this visit at my earliest opportunity. My only suggestion is choose a room on a lower floor. When they are crowded there is a signficant wait for elevators (they have 3). Had we been on the 3rd or 4th floor we would have used the stairs exclusively. I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this hotel. Enjoy!",,OBXfan1964,52,5.0

This was a poor choice. I had called a week in advance to request a room on a high floor, but when we checked in, we were put in a room on the 8th floor facing another brick building. I found it hard to believe this was the only room available as the associate said when we checked in. Just a few minutes after us, there were crowds of people checking in, I'm sure they were well accommodated. It was horrible for the price we paid. I had also requested a crib in the room. The associate said she would be up in 15 minutes after we checked in, but never showed. It took 2 phone calls to get the crib and it was after our long night out that we had to come back and deal with this. The room is tiny and very crowded with the ottoman, table, rolling chair, crib etc. There was no space for the baby to crawl around even if he wanted to. I felt like we were sleeping on a set of blankets, the mattress was very uncomfortable. When we checked out, the associate was rude and would barely look at me when we asked if we could wheel our luggage to the car which is parked in the $50 garage. So my husband had to bring the car around as I waited in a crowded lobby with a baby and luggage for 20 minutes. We also waited almost 30 minutes for a tiny elevator to get downstairs. It was so heavily used in the morning.The only perk was the free breakfast, which was convenient to grab some bagels as we couldn't get out of the hotel fast enough the next morning. I would not stay here again.","Boston, Massachusetts","tdont1014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",3,2.0

This one features oversized suite-like rooms with contemporary furnishings and a large bathroom. (See photos.)The location is a few blocks from Madison Square Garden/Penn Station and a fairly easy walk to Times Square and Broadway theaters. Quite convenient if you are flying into Newark and taking the train into Penn Station.

We couldn't have been happier with the rooms - clean, comfortable and well-appointed. Although we were only there for one night, the kitchenettes came in handy - especially because we took full advantage of the balconies. Each balcony was enclosed, affording a measure of privacy. Due the unseasonably warm weather, there's was still grass on the balcony, along with a table and four chairs. It was perfect for hanging out, snacking and drinking. We could hear the hum of the city and enjoy fresh air in the room (which had a ceiling fan - a really nice touch). We liked the wood floors and not having to worry about the cleanliness of the carpeting. The beds were comfortable, and the linens smelled and felt nice and fresh. The kitchenettes had all the supplies/equipment we needed (including a bottle opener). The bathrooms were spotless. The showers had good water pressure and we appreciated the Neutrogena body care products. The sink/vanity area was a little small, but we managed. Our only other (minor) complaint concerned the elevators. There were only three, so we wound up waiting up to five minutes to go up or down, but that was to be expected in mid-December when the hotel was completely sold-out. Last but not least, every single staff member we interacted with was genuinely friendly and helpful. They actually seemed to enjoy working as a team to make their guests happy. I can't remember the last time I formed that impression at a Manhattan hotel...Consensus among our group was that we will absolutely stay at the Homewood Suites Midtown for all of our future trips to New York.

BROOKLYN.I don't know how familiar you are with NYC, but Manhattan and Brooklyn are incredibly different. It's Like telling someone booked in San Diego that they've found room for them in Orange County.So, besides being ""walked"" to a different hotel, which is lousy enough, I was told it would be in Brooklyn. Obviously, this was not OK, since my meetings for the next two days were in Midtown ManhattanAfter arguing with the absurdly useless manager on duty -- who kept encouraging me to go to Brooklyn and seemed to think it was a totally logical and acceptable solution -- I canceled the reservation and booked elsewhere. Here's the best part: the hotel manager was willing to pay for my cab ride to the hotel in Brooklyn, but when I told him that I instead booked a hotel 10 blocks away, he wasn't willing to cough up a dime. I've only had great experiences at Hilton hotels up to this point.

While we enjoyed the room and hotel in general, pay close attention to the location and make certain it suits your needs/purpose for the trip, more to come later in the review on location.Rooms:The entry level room type (Efficiency Studio) rooms are standard in size and include a kitchenette, pillowtop mattress, modern bathroom with stand up glass shower stall and hard wood (faux) surface flooring. We were upgraded to a city view Studio room types on a higher floor which afforded a bit more space than the Efficiency Studio along with high ceilings and a limited city view. This room types is particularly nice for couples as it's generously sized and much larger than most NYC hotel rooms. The beds were very comfortable and we enjoyed having a stand up glass shower. The room included a kitchenette, fully stocked with dishes. There aren't many room per floor, however the elevators were slow during peak times.The Experience:Service was pleasant throughout the property, and staff were always available to help. I personally like smaller hotels of this genre in NYC as they are easy to get in/out of, especially compared to the hotel giants you'll find in Times Square.The Location:This neighborhood adjacent to Penn. Station is transitional. Yes, it's convenient to Times Square, Hell's Kitchen and MSG/Penn. Station, however I felt like the neighborhood was a bit ""sketchy"" at times. I didn't necessarily feel unsafe, but for Manhattan standards this area was dirty and full of interesting characters to say the least. That said, it was centrally located and easy to get from Newark airport as it was close to the tunnel.All in all, Homewood Suites Midtown offered a solid hotel experience in the middle of Manhattan. The hotel itself was impressive for a limited service property and had all the comforts you would anticipate at a four star property. Inclusions such as popcorn in the room, morning breakfast service and mid week evening wine / appetizers make it a great value. I would choose this property at the right price.","Los Angeles, California","ocGlobetraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",156,4.0

When I booked I requested a quiet room with a crib. I was very unimpressed with the attitude of reception staff at check in. We arrived at 9am after travelling for 30+ hours from Australia with our one-year-old daughter and were told our room was not ready. This was understandable, however the clerk then told me the room would not be available until 4pm, despite my printed confirmation stating that check-in time was 3pm. When I pointed this out, she grudgingly agreed to honour this and ensure the room would be ready by 3pm. We were not offered the use of any hotel facilities to freshen up or change our daughter, and when I asked where we could do this we were directed to a basement restroom that did not even have a changing table, so I was forced to change her on the floor. The whole attitude was dismissive and unhelpful. We left the hotel for a few hours, returning around 1pm because we were simply too exhausted to do anything but sit and wait. Upon asking again whether our room was ready, a different clerk rudely informed me it wouldn't be available until 4pm - not 3pm as had been assured upon our arrival. When I asked whether there was anything we could do to expedite the process, even offering to pay an early check-in fee, I was coldly informed that the hotel uses an external housekeeping company and it was not possible to instruct them to prioritise the preparation of one room over another. I find this extremely hard to believe (after all, one staff member had already demonstrated that it was possible to have the room ready by 3pm instead of 4pm) and if it is indeed true I would advise them to use a different company! I told the clerk that we would remain in the lobby until check-in, and to please let me know as soon as the room was available. An hour later, my husband asked again whether the room was ready and was told, 'Oh yeah, it's been ready for a while, we thought you'd left.' This was despite remaining in full view of the reception desk the entire time.Why does the hotel bother to ask for an estimated time of arrival upon booking if not to prioritise the preparation of rooms for guests who will be arriving early? I understand that check-in times are set for a reason, however the dismissive and downright rude attitude of the staff towards a clearly exhausted family with a distressed young child was really appalling. When we finally got to our room, it was on the second floor at the front of the building, which was unbearably noisy. Having booked more than six months in advance and specifically requested a quiet suite, this was such a disappointment. There was also no crib, despite having requested one at the time of booking, so we had to call housekeeping and ask for one to be sent up.We were also forced to leave a day early after our airline rescheduled our departing flight. When my husband went to the reception desk the night before to make sure there would be someone on hand to check us out at 6am, the clerk snapped at him, 'What are you asking me?'While the accommodation itself was very nice, the attitude of staff and indifferent service were not acceptable and I would not stay at this hotel again.","Sydney, Australia","NomadGirlSydney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,2.0

The room was small, not tiny, but had a very boxy feel with the laminate flooring. The bed was comfy, but the kitchen not really realistic for use, we didn't use it at all during the stay.The big issue we had however was the sound of the fridge, which every 30mins would click on and make an almighty drone so loud that it woke us up all through the night. I told hotel staff about this as soon as I heard the first time on arrival, they said they would send a maintenance guy to have a look - this never happened, or certainly not while we were in (which we were that night). The next evening I flagged the problem again with staff who told me quite rudely that I was simply not used to the sound of a fridge (you'll see from my reviews I stay in apartment hotels quite regularly, so am quite used to the associated noise). In the end we pushed two towels above the freezer unit which seemed to help the rattling and drone. I was surprised we were not better looked after, taken seriously or offered a room change, having spent over $1000 on our stay.Wouldn't recommend.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Loran_88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",7,2.0

Even the basic rooms are very spacious. I arrived close to check in time at 4pm. The lobby was a bit of a madhouse. I give the hotel credit for having 4 people checking in customers. I've been in similar situations with just 1 or 2 people staffed at that time and I appreciated the extra people working at this busy time. Homewood Suites - do not change this. You are one of the few hotels smart enough to have extra staff at check in and it is a big difference. The lobby is not very big, and there were a few groups waiting for their rooms and an enormous amount of luggage. Unfortunately, there are not enough elevators to service busy periods and I did wait in line in the lobby a few times for an elevator, and also had to skip a few elevator cars trying to leave my room. I have seen worse situations in other NYC hotels, but it was still a bit annoying. LI had a normal room with king bed. It is large by NYC standards. I liked the wood floors instead of hotel carpet. My impression is that it is easier to keep clean. My room was very clean and the bed was comfortable. There was a small couch and a desk area as well. The kitchen was clean and what you would expect in an efficiency hotel situation. In my room, the refrigerator was very close to the bed and the compressor was pretty loud and woke me up a few times.The breakfast was pretty standard and staffed by more than one person, which was nice. The space was kept clean and the food was restocked as needed. However, the space is not nearly big enough to handle the nearly 300 rooms at this hotel, but the staff has done a great job organizing the space to accommodate as many people as possible. It is actually quite impressive how many people they did fit, but do not plan on finding seats right away at busy times. This is a good example of something the hotel can't really change (amount of first floor space) but clear evidence of a lot of thought being put into how to make the best of the situation.Overall, this is a great hotel if you want to be in this area. It is convenient for tourism, although the area directly around the hotel is not the most exciting or my favorite in NYC.

It's like a home from home apparently. Which I suppose it is; if you sleep within arms length from a full blown fridge-freezer. The rooms are, shall we say, compact...then again it is New York and I'm not a millionaire. Compared to other hotels within similar budgets Homewood does have tight room space. Breakfast was included - as long as you are not on a super tight budget I really wouldn't bother! Nowhere near enough seats for the hotel occupancy which led to people sitting in the breakfast room, reception, the lobby, the lifts and presumably their rooms as well. The food was not worth fighting through the stampede of flooding tourists - no proper queuing etiquette!! There is a ""suite"" (see what they did there?) shop located at the front desk. It's a bit like a high end designer boutique, there's no prices so assume you can't afford it. A stash of munchies (1 nights worth) cost us the best part of $50 in room charges. 7/11 located round the corner. The staff were lovely and the rooms were spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable and the shower had a good bit of force behind it as well. The walls between rooms are relatively thin but as long as your neighbours aren't in the middle of a domestic it's not drastic. Overall, the hotel just didn't do it for us. Also, there isn't a bar?! It seemed to be a massive hit for families with young children. I think it's more suited for the family market.","Livingston, United Kingdom","Notexactlyhemmingway</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Livingston, United Kingdom</strong>",0,3.0

However, the staff could not accommodate us for early check-in (we were kind of ready for it). Though, he offered us breakfast for that day even at 10:15AM. We were also offered to store our luggage till check-in time.Our room was ready when we came for check-in around 5PM. The room was nice, well-kept and clean. Bed was quite comfortable. However, the bed sheet was torn from a lot of places. We didn't housekeeping to change it as we didn't stay in the room during the day. The room offered a street view but there was nothing like a good view. Everything (coffee/sugar/MW pop corns/etc.) was well stocked up. There's a microwave, dishwasher and lot of utensils being an extended stay hotel. However, we never used any of these.Bathroom was small but nice. It had a standing shower area and Neutrogena brand toiletries. The only thing we didn't like was the door separating the shower area and the rest of the bathroom as the door didn't close properly which lead to water flowing outside. Housekeeping staff did a good job in cleaning the room.Breakfast was decent enough and offered good variety of food. Timings ranged from 6:30 in the morning to 10:30AM. Coffee/chocolate drinks were offered 24/7.We also had a chance to attend evening reception one day. It was far below our expectations. There were some items which ran out within 45mins of opening hours. They do offer wine and beer along with few snacks. But the quality and quantity was an issue. We reached out to the hotel about these small issues but the response was like they don’t care about it.Overall a nice hotel. The price is not worth it though considering we paid $650 for staying just 2 nights.

The room isn't really a suite but it does have a refrigerator and a microwave. The room, including the bathroom, was much smaller than i expected.The view was terrible, just an empty buidling being remodeled.The staff was quite friendly and helpful. I used their business center frequently and when i need some things not in that center, they made every effort to find them for me.There was a little vending area near the check-in desk but the prices were quite high. One BEWARE: they offered limousine services to the airports but the rates were much higher than are found in tourist magazines. The concierge was very friendly and really tried to get tickets for popular musical but it was just impossible.All in all, I felt it was good for a short stay but small rooms and too pricey.There is a buffet breakfast but it's a zoo with many people. More than once, I would leave something on a table, get my food, then come back to see someone had taken my table and moved my food.They did have a dinner as well but I usually got back too late to try it.","Sacramento, California","John W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento, California</strong>",96,4.0

The floor was laminate, which I really liked and the color scheme was blue, which was relaxing. Plenty of plugs for all our devices, which is a must for this digital family.When our TV wouldn't work we called the front desk and someone came right away and fixed it. The elevators were quick and we never waited very long for one. The lobby was modern looking with a tv, fireplace, and comfy sofa to relax on.

The location is good for tourists as it is close to time square, and also located near 8th Ave. and 9th Ave , which are good North-South streets to get you around town via cab. There are plenty of good places to eat within a few blocks of this location. I also found a bike rental place on 38th which was a great way to rent a bike for hours and explore the city. Riding in the streets is not as bad as it sounds, there are bike lanes on many streets. Anyway, the hotel was very clean, and very quiet. It has a very new a fresh feel to it.

The breakfast was a bit of a let down. I would have liked to have seen more options and perhaps having someone monitor the tables and direct people to a table to suit their group size. It was just a free for all and extremely difficult to get a table to sit down to eat.At check out I was given my invoice which showed I was charged an extra 200 dollars which would be reimbursed into my account within 2-3 weeks. I was really disappointed as I was not informed upon check in that this would happen. I can understand taking a deposit (if made aware) but I was more annoyed that I would not receive this back into my account for some time. After querying this at reception I was told that this was policy. I can understand that this may be a policy but I should have been made aware of this at check in and been asked to sign to authorise that this was ok to be taken from my card - I did not.

I'm guessing hotels only need to check certain boxes of random amenities to get 4 stars. This hotel is a very nice corporate studio style hotel. The fixtures are all very new (cabinets, flooring, kitchenette) and stylish. This string or apartment hotels around the high 30s on the west side all cost a bit more because they've got a small kitchenette. Personally I'd say that's good for anything over 5 days. Under and you're not really going to use it. The gym is well equipped for a hotel gym. I appreciate the self laundry in the basement. The staff is great. They seem very busy but they're also very efficient. Check in was very fast and professional. They also had my room ready 3 hours early. My gripe would have been that a 4 pm check in time for a hotel room is far too late. I prefer 2pm and 3pm is the norm in NYC. I was thankful I was able to check in early and easily. Great front desk staff! Breakfast isn't spectacular but it's free and definitely more than the average free pastry.The bed linens do feel a bit cheap and corporate. My only issue isn't really the hotel's issue. The crowd of people staying here always seem to be congregating in the lobby. It's constantly packed with very... ""non-city"" travelers and families. It's a bit odd I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was only during my stay. Still compared to other hotels I've stayed in in Manhattan I do think I'd say this is a 4 star quality.If like me you can get a deal rate on hotels tonight id say it's worth it. If you can't I'd say the 300+ price tag it was before is overpriced. Overall a nice experience and great hotel!

The hotel itself is really nicely appointed with large rooms (for NYC) and is very clean and well kept. Breakfast was great if a little crowded - nice selection for our whole family. Now the staff - Junior was there to greet us and get us into our room and he was there to keep our luggage on the last day so that we could take in a play before we left. He answered all of our questions and had great customer service skills. Aneta and Yvette from housekeeping helped us muddle through getting our forgotten items back - great communication, very quick to respond! I wish I could say the same for Leslie at the front desk. She was rude and condescending. We decided to take in an afternoon performance and start part of the way home on our check out day and called down to the desk to make sure it was okay given the short notice. The gentleman that I spoke to ensured us that there would be no charge imposed for the early departure - something we double checked when we got to the lobby on our way out in the morning. Flash forward to check out time where Leslie printed my receipt and when I questioned the fact that it did not have the name of the hotel on the letterhead she quite disdainfully remarked that if she reprinted it that would make no difference. Then she asked for the receipt back - I complied thinking that she was going to make an effort to reprint it as I required that the hotel information be on the receipt but no! She told me that she would have to redo the bill because we would have to pay for the evening's stay as we did not provide the required notice. When I told her that we had spoken to some one she was very condescending, her attitude was in stark contrast to what we had experienced so I would still recommend this hotel but this was not the best way to end our trip. Oh and I had to call when I got home to request a new copy of the bill on letterhead - really Leslie, it would have been so much easier if you had just done it when I asked you to.

There was a kitchen with a microwave, full size refrigerator, and a dish washer. Complimentary microwave popcorn was waiting for us when we arrived, and when I asked the desk if we could have an additional bag, they sent up several.The hotel is located in the Garment District, which is about a 10 minute walk to Times Square and a 20 minute train ride to Battery Park. Penn Station is located right around the corner, so it is easy to travel anywhere in the city.Besides how clean and nicely decorated this hotel is, my favorite aspect was the complimentary evening meals this hotel provides Monday - Thursday from 5:00 PM -7:00 PM and breakfast every morning. Every evening, the meal had a different theme and we ate well while we were there. Not having to look for somewhere to eat and spend our money on food, proved to be a huge bonus to us. Also, there were always healthy options available and the quality of food was much better than most hotels that I have stayed in (Including other Hiltons).We stayed on the third level (I think that the 2 Queen beds are limited to the first 6 floors or so) and we never heard a sound from the street. There is a small but beautiful garden located on the rooftop, where we would retire in the evenings to call our families. I originally preferred a higher room (I think the hotel is about 24 stories high), but I was grateful for the lower room because the elevators were slow and we were able to easily take the stairs.

Cons: very few, however, very limited closet space and some wear showing on bathroom mirrors. The sofa bed was concave and although staff brought in an additional pad, was basically not useable for sleep. Nonetheless, we had a wonderful stay at this very nice hotel! Would stay there again.","Portland, Oregon","lluckylab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",8,5.0

Very happy to have the buffet breakfast available, which is a significant time and money saver. Room and hotel were in great shape. Staff was unfailingly friendly and helpful.A couple of things to be aware of: • We were next to a ""hearing accessible"" room, which has a doorbell button outside. This button not only triggers a flashing light in the suite (which makes sense, to alert a hearing impaired guest) but also buzzes very loudly. One night, late night visitors to our neighbour woke us up with this loud buzzing periodically until 2:30 am. No problem on other nights. I would not want to be next to one of these buzzer rooms again.• Our room — all rooms with 2 queen beds, we were told — had the bathroom sink, vanity, mirror, closet AND safe, all together inside the bathroom with the toilet and the shower. i.e. if someone is on the toilet or in the shower, anyone else who wants to get something out of the closet or safe, or wants to shave, apply makeup, brush their teeth, etc, is inhibited from doing so. This is an inconvenient design for the very group that would be most interested in having the two bed suite.I would definitely stay in this hotel again, due to its value, quality and convenience, as long as I was not next to a buzzer room.","Toronto, Canada","nxnw18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

Location of the hotel is excellent in a few blocks you are right in the heart of time square other direction a few blocks down Madison square garden hotel is a perfect location to be away from all the city noise but you are not too far either. Breakfast was included every morning which was excellent only problem was the area where the food was laid out got very crowded at peak times(Be sure to get down before peak time) and there was no one way system or anything so was everyman for himself.The lifts also get very busy at the peak times so you could be waiting longer than normal for the lift. Not a big deal. On certain nights they have complimentary drinks laid out this was such a nice touch to have cause after a long day walking around the city it was nice to pick up a glass and relax in the room.There is a rooftop area where you can go and sit and enjoy This is really nice as you don’t find many NYC hotels with a rooftop area. However I think there is a lot more potential for this area to include more tables /chairs/lounge area and maybe have certain nights where food / drinks where located on the roof.Room:The rooms are a great size it had everything you could need including a full Kitchenette e.g Full sized fridge, coffee machine. There was also a sofa bed in the room with a table even with all this there was still plenty of room to walk about the room.Lobby:In some hotels the lobby is just a passing by area for people coming and going however they appear to have put a lot of thought into the lobby it has a Fireplace, Waterfall feature, cosy sitting area with plug outlets/USB ports.Nice area to relax and wind down If you are looking for a good Mexican close to get some food/drink ‘Lucy's Cantina Royale’ has a nice rooftop area and is right beside penn station about 10 minute walk from hotel. The hotel also arranged transport for us to the airport on day of leaving.Would recommend this to anyone looking for a relaxing no fuss stay in New York.Thank you for a great stay will look forward to another stay ","Dublin, Ireland","Emma D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",3,5.0

From the minute we walked in until we left they were the most congenial, courteous and friendly staff, always smiling, helping with any questions we had. We were in room 601, a kingsize bed and nice kitchenette no bathroom, actually found the room very spacious and quiet tho the window faced the street. Really I can't say anything negative about the room. Oh wait....the pillows, it's time to invest in some quality pillows and ditch the ones in the room. That's the only minus and it's not like it was a make or break deal. Loved the included in room, complimentary wi-fi, speed was fine for us, didn't feel a need to upgrade the speed.Location is a 10-15 minute walk from Times Square and many theaters. While we're not impressed with NYC, the hotel was convenient enough for the time we spent in the city and I'd definitely recommend it.Breakfast was OK, the usual cereals, yogurts, fruits, scrambled eggs and some type of breakfast meat, bagels, juice and pastries, plenty of choices. It was redundant but a nice inclusive meal so one doesn't have to head out early for breakfast unless they choose to.The weather was really hot so it was nice to return in time for a glass or two of wine during the evening reception, M-Th, 5-7 pm. We actually had a light bite a few nights at the buffet rather than heading back out, having eaten lunch out.I just can't share enough positive comments on Homewood Suites. Having read some of the comments on TA and several other websites I felt the negatives were unwarranted but that's only my opinion. Yes there are only 3 elevators for 22 floors but it was never a problem, you just wait a few minutes, no big deal. The wine at the reception was Sutter Home, but hey, there's no charge. Redundant breakfast and so-so food at the reception buffet, these are great perks and offered by few hotels in the city, again, if you don't like what's served its easy enough to dine elsewhere.Thanks for a great stay Homewood Suites.

The breakfast was very good and well stocked and the staff were excellent in their interactions. I will stay again here. My rating of 4/5 is only because of a minor glitch which I hope they will remedy soon. I booked a handicap access - mobility queen 2 bed room and I called ahead to let the front desk now that we will be checking in late. We arrived at 11pm. The property is easy to find and the front staff showed us the nearest parking which is within 25 feet of the entrance. Despite the phone call the handicap room was not available. The staff were very apologetic of this error. The fact that I could not take a shower the first night or next morning was made up by the manager and the front staff waiving the first night charges and helping us move to a handicap room the next day when we were exploring NY city. As a very nice gesture, I found an apology letter from the manager with some fruits, snacks and a free movie pass in the new room. I have to say that the staff handled the error very well and I found the rest of the hotel fantastic.

It is close to attractions and when exiting the city, it is only 1/2 block from the Lincoln Tunnel. The room I had was not as large as other Homewood Suites (it was a studio with a kitchen area), but you have to keep in perspective that this is New York City; so, it was probably still larger than a typical NYC room with the extra amenities expected at a Homewood Suites. There are select rooms with private balconies, but I did not stay in one of those rooms. The rooftop patio (an open area, not a bar) was OK, but I think it allows smoking. It is on the 37th Street side, and you can look up and down the street and slightly see the Hudson River to the west, but I wouldn't call it a view. This property is not as tall as other buildings around it; hence, it does not have views from any of the rooms as far as I could tell. I stayed on the ""back side"" of the hotel opposite of 37th Street, and it was quiet. The only thing I could hear was my neighbor's door opening and closing. If selecting your room online, you may want to consider a room where the next room's door is not immediately adjacent to yours.I enjoyed the patio off of the lobby to relax at the end of the night. Again, no views, but there is comfortable furniture, and you can bring your own refreshments.My largest issue at this property was check-in. They were busy; so, after checking in and not receiving my two bottles of complementary water with my Hilton Honors, I figured it was an honest, understandable oversight, and politely asked the staff member for them (they were on the floor less than 5 feet away from her). What I received was as best incorrect instructions on how my online profile/preferences were wrong, and I need to change them so that she can see that I want water and to choose receiving it instead of points. At worst, I could consider it a lecture. Who lectures their guest when checking in? I have stayed at over a dozen Hilton Honors properties, including three Homewood Suites in 2015, and never had this happen once. At the time I politely said I would look into it and went on my way, but since I have confirmed that the staff member was incorrect. The above interaction is probably minor and did not ruin my experience (it is after all only two bottles of water), but what is bothersome to me is that the morning of check out, I received a letter on my door from a manager thanking me for my stay, and if I could not rate them 9 or 10, I should contact her at the email address provided. Since I would not rate my check-in experience a 9 or 10, I emailed her, but I have not received a response one-week later (I will amend this review if I receive one in the future). I know it was a standard form letter, but don't go through the exercise if you do not want to be contacted.In summary, a quiet property in a good location. Rooms were the typical down-sized NYC versions for hotel chains compared to their properties outside the city, but it was very nice (but don't book if a view is important to you). I did not have any issues with breakfast or waiting for the elevators like other reviewers. You see I still give this property 4 out of 5 dots, as I do realize my issue may be individual in nature that most other guests will not have. Personally, however, I will need to think about if I will stay here again.","Jessup, Pennsylvania","docamadeus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jessup, Pennsylvania</strong>",8,4.0

On the 17th floor and didn't suffer any noise issues at all despite being near the lifts.WiFi is good but it seems you have to log back in every time you re-enter the building.You are very close to Times Square, Macy's etc etc only a short walk away.Bad points:The lobby offers free coffee 24hrs but I have to say that each time I tried to get a cup all of the four containers were empty with no effort made by staff to refill them even when they saw that was the case.The breakfast is a complete shambles, and probably best described as a 'free for all'. The serving area is far too small for the number of guests and we just gave up and went elsewhere during our four nights there.There is a roof terrace advertised but a bit of a let down its just a few chairs and a couple of tables with not a lot to see other than surrounding apartments. Seemed to me to be the place that people gathered to smoke.Could be better and I expected more for what I paid for, I think I would try somewhere else next time.","Isle of Man, United Kingdom","cgt180</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Isle of Man, United Kingdom</strong>",83,3.0

When we arrived, the staff was great and let us know about the free breakfast and managers reception. I was not expecting free wine and beer in Manhattan. The room was very functional; all of the furniture was made to overlap each other so you could easily maneuver it to make more room if you needed it. My son sleep in the single pull out couch so it was the perfect size for the three of us. I loved the kitchenette, full size microwave and a midsize fridge. There was even free popcorn in the room which was a big hit with my son. We were directly adjacent to the elevator so I expected to hear noise as it moved between floors and when people exited.

And as what the reviews have said, its awesome, efficient and friendly staff are the real superstars.I honestly don't like it when clients/hotel visitors treat hotel staff as servants and act like divas and expect them to cater to their every whim. As such, I also don't expect hotel staff to act servile, subservient and overly people-pleasing.I just expect them to act normal, warm and simply be efficient in their jobs, which are expected of all of us anyway.What stood out to me about the staff was how constantly they checked in on the guests in the hotel, without being fake or irritating. They give you space but they do take the initiative to check in on you or at least say Hi.From the person who washes the windows, to Jennifer (Fire Safety Director) who we met at the rooftop lounge and said Hi and checked if we were doing ok and to the best first impression I've ever had of a front desk person, Nafeesa (hope I am spelling this correctly), who checked me in when I arrived. Jennifer and Nafeesa should be given a raise.Also worthy of a raise were the guy and the girl who were assigned at the front desk at night (that single night I stayed), sorry I forgot to take note of their names. They were so helpful to suggest a nearby place to eat that was still open that late. And, they even helped me with my photo project by advising the best place at Times Square that will fulfill the pic I needed to take.Overall, it's one of the best hotels I've stayed in in New York. I've been to hotels that are more expensive than Homewood Suites in the U.S. and overseas but this hotel managed to bring the heart along with the fancy. I was so impressed that I plan to stay here again (and again).PS.Free breakfast. Free drinks I think during the work week nights, too bad I checked in on Sunday. And definitely free tea and coffee at lobby any time of the day.","Quezon City, Philippines","kristian_cruz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Quezon City, Philippines</strong>",30,5.0

The property is not in my preferred location when staying in the city as it is a highly congested area but for this week it served us well. It is 3 blocks to port authority (we took the bus into the city) and to the subway. Our suite was small but efficient; a king bed (although it was more like a queen) and a sofa that converted to a sleeper; it faced the interior of the building and was very quiet. A kitchenette (2 burner stove / toaster / microwave w/ all of the pots/pans etc you need) with a full size fridge. The room was clean and modern. Lighting was good; I worked in the room for 3 days with solid wifi connectivity - there are also many outlets in the room - including bedside for your chargers. Breakfast was simple - hot items (eggs/omelets etc) were OK - but there was plenty of cereal / yogurt / bakery items. There is an evening reception Mon-Thurs that includes beer / wine which was great after a long day. Dinner is also offered - which again was OK. But it did allow us to get a snack after a long day (veggies / chips & dip) and take away some food (e.g. chinese / salad - the menu varied each day) for my daughter who had even longer days in the event she wanted a late night dinner. The servers were gracious to offer take away containers. Coffee and tea are always available in the lobby. There is a lovely roof top deck - on the 22nd floor, which we enjoyed each night. Overall, the staff was very accommodating for our needs and extremely pleasant and cheerful. There are many restaurants that are quite good along 9th and 10th avenue if you head north (Hell's Kitchen) so you don't need to go far for a good meal. Overall, a great property and would stay here again.","Allentown, Pennsylvania","bellaverona</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Allentown, Pennsylvania</strong>",12,4.0

Let me start with the positives. The hotel's location is excellent and the fact that it is located between 8th and 9th Aves means access to great restaurants, transportation, near Madison Square Garden etc. It is central enough without being subjected to crowds. The breakfast is decent and coffee throughout the day is always a plus.That being said, having stayed at other homewood suites, I expected a similar configuration. I was expecting too much. This hotel is good for two persons per room and no more. It was three of us and the room with the king bed and sofa bed was way too small for three persons with luggage!When I arrived there, the front desk rep was not very friendly and when I asked if a bigger room was possible as I was trying for months to access one online, I was told impossible. No visible attempts were made to see what was happening. I tried to call a Manager the following day and I was put on hold and I am still waiting. I made that call on Sunday and today is Wednesday!I was subsequently advised that they were booked to capacity and that their one bedroom suites were almost never available as they were permanently booked out. What was very telling about the service was that I cut a 28 day stay to 4/days and not one manager or supervisor called to find out why the drastic change. That said something to me. I think they need to review the reservations requirements such as number of persons per room etc. I realized for a few dollars more, there are aparthotels in NYC which are roomier and more comfortable to rival this one.","Port of Spain, Trinidad","ttonna78</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port of Spain, Trinidad</strong>",2,2.0

I originally booked three nights but I had to change our stay to one night. Even though I booked the hotel months ahead of time, when I changed the number of nights we were staying, the rate was changed to a higher rate, so my original rate did not lock in. My one night stay costs me $415.00 which is outrageous. I made the mistake of not canceling my entire stay and moving to a different hotel. We stayed in a suite, which all suites are located on the 2nd floor. You can hear the noise on the street, so if you are a light sleeper, you cannot stay in a suite. Our suite was nice. The hotel is located a few blocks from Times Square and we were able to walk to most venues and did not have a problem catching the subway to the 911 Memorial. We were encourage to have the front desk call a car service for transportation to the airport, as you never know what a taxi cab will charge. We were told, and I asked one other time about the cost of the car to LaGuardia and were told $55. The driver charged us $60. Not sure if that is the fault of the hotel or the fault of the car company. For the cost of a one night stay in NYC, I would stay elsewhere, because there are hundreds of hotels out there which are just as nice, and cost a lot less.","St. Louis, United States","Tom M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Louis, United States</strong>",1,3.0

The breakfast includes orange juice, apple juice, lemonade, ice cold water, coffee, tea and hot chocolate for beverages. You can choose between sugar frosted cornflakes, granola with dried berries, honeyloops or you can taste them all ;-). Everyday they have yoghurt and berries (fresh and dried) with sliced almonds. They also offer a different plate with eggs (omelette with vegetables, with cheese, with pork, scrambled, ...) and some kind of meat (pork sausages, pork hash with white sauce, turkey burger, ...). Different kinds of bread and breakfast cakes/cookies are included, also sweet jelly, butter and cream cheese (diet and original).At evening (between 5 and 7 p.m.) you can go to the dining room for diner. The staff calls it that way, but I honestly think of it as 'snacks' because there isn't enough choice to really enjoy it like you should for diner. Most of the time the dishes were really salted and totally not healthy (hotdogs, burgers, ...). But I enjoyed the baby spinach salad on Wednesday.Now some advice for the staff and complaints about the hotel... Every area in the hotel is very cold. It's nice to enter a cold place when you've just had a long and exhausting walk in Manhattan, but when you're sitting in the lobby or dining room to enjoy a cup of tea, you definately need a cardigan or sweater. It is really that cold! The housekeeping also needs to check the drawers in the bedside cupboards, because there was a dirty handkerchief in there when we arrived. It was still there when we left the room before check-out. They also didn't clean the shower that well. I find hygiene very important and I don't want anything in my room from the previous visitor and definately no used handkerchiefs...Also one little thing. The refrigerator in our room made a really annoying noise at night. It often jumps on when we were asleep and then we couldn't sleep anymore without ear plugs. We enjoyed the location of the hotel. It is close to Penn Station, where you easily can take the train to anywhere in New York. With these little adjustments our stay in this hotel would be perfect.

The location of this hotel is not the best. The streets are not clean, they smell and there's a lot of construction. There's no parking either. We had to park in a public parking next door, and I did not feel safe there because it is a valet-style parking. You MUST give your car key to the attendants there to park it for you. It cost us $50 for 24H.As for the hotel itself, the lobby is quite small, but clean. The staff at the reception were nice and welcoming. The room was small (what do you expect from NY?), but it was clean. The only dirt that I found was on the bed sheets. It looked like someone had done some mechanic work on a car, and it did not wash off the sheets very well. The kitchenette was a nice addition, but we did not use it. There was free coffee and tea in the room. There was free coffee in the lobby available all the time as well.The biggest complaint I have was the free breakfast that came with the room. It was meh. Holiday Inn has better breakfasts. There weren't many options, and no eggs! They served mini bagels, too. Why not serve regular sized for adults and mini for kids or something? I know it was included with the room rate, but it's not like the room was cheap either. For $350 a night, we'd expect better breakfast, at least.Another complaint that I have were the elevators. You have to wait a long time to get into one which were very small and only fit a few people at a time. If you have big luggage and many family members, you'd probably have to go up in groups.Would I stay here again?

Kitchenette was very beneficial when warming up leftovers and hosting friends on patio for lunch. The roof top terrace is great for lounging with friends before heading out. The rooftop views are limited but still nice. Breakfast was a little lack luster, but since its free I guess I can really complain.

It was a weekday so we enjoyed the free dinner buffet, that started an hour after check in (perfect timing after the subway trip). The wine and beer were also a delicious treat and great starter to a gorgeous night. The view from the rooftop, especially at night is great.

Bathroom, clean and well stocked with designer soaps and lotions which I am thankful for. Having a kitchen in the room was great cuz I got to heat up the food we brought up from the dinner buffet, as well as cook food we picked up on our way. The king bed was like sleeping on a cloud. Hubby knocked out at the end of the night almost immediately and slept deeper than his has in a long long time; we both did. Having a 12pm check out time was perfect too.

The tv is a late model smart tv and there were enough channels for me. They allowed us to check out late which was great as our flight is at 5pm. The walk to Times Square was under 10 minutes. That was a plus. I would come again.","Pearland, Texas","jacksonjetsetter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pearland, Texas</strong>",4,5.0

He had us checked in, in no time and offered us hot chocolate and coffee before we were shown to our rooms.We were extremely happy with our stay here. The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. The reception staff were all extremely helpful and kind. They always greeted with genuine smiles and offered friendly advice. We enjoyed the simple breakfast in the mornings...bagels, eggs and coffee was sufficient for us until lunch. We didn't have dinner, although also complimentary during weekdays. I also made use of the washing machines and dryers which were very useful and can take huge loads. We found the location very convenient and walked to Time Square and Fifth Ave every day. The complimentary beverages are really great especially when you return from a walk and you are freezing. My kids were addicted to the hot chocolate. I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else because Homewood Suites ticked all the right boxes for me and offers family friendly spacious accommodation.","Durban, South Africa","KwazuluNatalSunshine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durban, South Africa</strong>",94,5.0

I was planning to attend BookExpo America and selected the hotel because it is so centrally located to the Javits Center, Times Square and Penn Station (fantastic travel hub in the city). This hotel is no more than a 10 minute walk from any of those things, plus the hotel is less than a year old and gorgeous.I actually arranged for a block of rooms for myself and my friends as we were all attending the same event from all across the country and wanted to be near each other. Both Marina and Natalia worked with me to give us a wonderful discount to make the trip more affordable for everyone. Not only that, but they also let us invite a few friends over and have a get-together on their gorgeous rooftop lounge area. The rooftop has a spectacular view of the city and the Hudson River. My friends not staying in the same hotel as us were jealous (rightfully so).My entire stay the staff was more than amazing. If I needed more towels they were delivered promptly. If I wanted to order pizza and wasn't sure what place was best, the front desk guys told us their favorite place to order from (they were right - it was amazing). Marina and Natalia personally came out to greet me, and I heard from all my friends staying in the hotel that they loved the hotel and their rooms.I slept on the pullout sofa in our room and was surprised to find I actually slept better on it than my king size mattress at home. Like, really? Even a pullout sleeper sofa is amazing here, too?!The dining area is large and comfortable and includes and outdoor space that is enclosed and shaded giving you privacy and fresh air without blinding sunlight. I cannot say enough about this hotel and the staff. Every hotel should aspire to be this clean, courteous, and hospitable.

I contacted the hotel to find out which of this type of room did not have the fridge right next to the bed as I was afraid of the noise from previous reports I had read. I then checked us in on line and chose a room on the 19th floor at the back of the hotel. We heard no outside noise at all except the odd siren. The room was spotless, bed comfy and perfect amount of space for two people. The breakfast was ok it got us going in the morning.

At one point, when we walked in, there was about 20 baggage kept on the floor at the lobby area.The elevators are small and sometimes the wait is long.Bathroom for the one king bed non smoking room was rather small. I am very short and thin and even for me , I could not shower well as the my hands were constantly hitting the walls.The good things :Location : This is right where you want to be if you stay in Manhattan. Walkable distance to Times square, Penn station etc and easy metro access to get to anywhere you want to go in the city.Rooms: I stay in a lot of Hilton brand hotels and this one is a little different from the ones I have seen and in a good way. It is modern and contemporary design which you don't find in other Hilton hotels I have seen. Part of that is also because, this place is relatively new. Liked the wooden floors which is better than stinky carpets at other places. Room had good flat led tv, full size fridge, full size microwave, locker, lot of crockery/utensils, full size dish washer etc. Beds and pillows were very comfortable.Housekeeping did a good job everyday we were there.Breakfast : Again modern and clean sitting area for the breakfast. Free cofee 24 hrs near the lobby area. Breakfast was nothing stellar, but decent enough.In general, for the price, we thought it was worth it and would stay there again if we go again.

Twin (2 x queen) rooms hard to come by.....book early.This is not a hotel so don't expected a mini bar, restaurant, bar or room service. If you want these features go else where. If you want a wonderful central location, (we walked nearly everywhere), close to subway (& Penn station), room to move & kitchen facilities just in case u are in the mood to cook or at least heat something in your microwave (& keep icecream in a freezer!) then stay here! Breakfast is included - toast, bagels, cereal, juice, various hot options that change daily but include oatmeal (we ate a couple of times but only some looked palatable!) Tea, coffe, hot chocolate free 24hrs in lobby.Mon- Thurs 5-7pm there is a FREE evening meal with wine & beer!! No choice of food but it's free. A monthly planner of the meals is on your room fridge, so if it's something you don't like, then you won't bother coming back in time to eat, but the option is there. A really wonderful bonus to have even if u just have a drink on your way in or out! The free wifi states that it is for 3 devices only, but whether this is flexible I'm not sure.Level 22 has a roof top terrace if you want to sit & view the skyline.Never used the gym....walked enough about the city!Laundry was $2.50 per load for washer & same for dryer. (Change available at reception)Mini mart of food & sundries in lobby. A 7-11 is around the corner on 8th for more choice. There are other supermarkets with cheaper food but more of a distance. Sometimes you are happy to pay for convenience.9th ave has great restaurants & cheaper than than the very busy 8th ave.8th ave (near Port Authority bus terminal) is a bit seedy especially at night.Great cheap pizza one block up on 38th & 8th - $1 slices!!We had a king efficiency room. Large bed plus sofa. Bathroom small with inadequate bench space for toiletries bags. Room at back of hotel so view into another building but quiet.Requested (numerous times before & after our arrival) & were eventually moved to the preferred double room! Thank you!! This was on a lower level (6) at the front of the hotel, but there was no noise that bothered us. Perhaps a very light sleeper may have issues. This room had a shower over the bath with a shower curtain....not a nice as the previous rooms shower with glass sliding doors, but still fine. This bathroom had the much needed shelf space for toiletries. I mention this to make people aware that not all rooms/bathrooms are the same layout, so don't make a decision based upon one review alone (- or +)The double room was very spacious. 2 queen beds plus a sofa; desk with chair & roll under table that can be used for meals; free standing sofa side table that folds open to create a table to use on the sofa or with the 2 foot rest stools. There was also shelf space on the wall under the TV to store your bits & pieces.Our first room on level 14 had a half height window where as on level 6 we had a full length window with one small opening window (it only opens a few inches, but it's enough to help gauge the weather outside!)The bedside tables & desk have plenty of power points so all the phones, cameras etc can be recharged at the same time.The kitchenettes in both rooms were the same: microwave, full fridge/freezer, 2 burner cook top, crockery, glassware, toaster, and plenty of cookware.Rooms have a ceiling fan as well as own air conditioning. There are reading lamps & good lighting throughout.The decore is fresh and modern....floor boards and wallpaper with cute decorative touches, full length mirror & silk flowers. Our only negative was with the concierge. We enquired about Broadway tickets on our first night, but didn't realize how much of a mark up on the face value of the tickets there would be!!! ($149 each for tickets that had $88 printed on them!!!) Book your own shows! Try 'rush' tickets through the theatre or TKTS in Times Square if you have time. (Lower Manhattan location easier as not as busy) We got $30 rush tickets for Gigi & $37 rush lottery tickets for Kinky Boots. (Google Broadway rush tickets to learn more) We felt the concierge should have suggested options to us rather just just selling us expensive tickets where he was obviously getting a commission. The show we went to was on offer every day at 50% off at TKTS, so we paid $300 for a show we could have seen for $90 :-(I was under the impression a concierge is there to be helpful, not make a profit out of guests. If you are after clean, apartment style accommodation, close to transport, Broadway & Times Square then consider these suites, especially if booking early & getting a good rate.","Perth, Australia","Sandytravels_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",91,4.0

The bathroom was a comfortable size; it had a large shower -- no tub (no problem for us, but bath lovers beware!).This location looks pretty new -- everything seems to be in good shape. The room rate included a full breakfast, which lived up to the standard of other Homewood locations that we've experienced.The street was rather quiet -- not sure if this is true all the time.

Good: daily breakfast had hot items. The first morning, there was scrambled eggs, bacon, and hash browns. My son liked the eggs and asked for more. The second morning, there was a cheese filled premade omelettes w pieces of bell peppers, pork sausage patties. We got the last items in the tray so they were cold. The sausage patties were flavorful but too spicy for my kid. French toast sticks available one morning, too.There was the usual cereal, oatmeal, toppings for oatmeal, yogurt (and toppings), bagels, pastry, etc. each morning. The room was clean and the kitchen items were adequate. As compared to other Homewood Suites, this was a very, very small suite. The two-seater love seat was in the back of the room so it was hard to get to. Kitchen appliances worked just fine.Staff was friendly and cordial. I had a few minor issues w booking the room online but they resolved it just fine. The coffee and drinks were always available and stocked. My son spilled a full cup of hot chocolate and the front desk called for a cleaner w a gracious attitude, not an annoyed attitude like some hotels would display. Five stars for attitude!Needs improvement: the dining area was tight as was the breakfast buffet area. On the second morning, I just couldn't fight the crowd and sent my friend in. The love seat pulled out into a twin size bed. The foam mattress was one of the cheapest I've seen, not representative of a Hilton chain. An adult would have a problem sleeping on this. Recommend that management figure out a way to handle breakfast traffic. Maybe add a few round tables to the lobby which can be used for guests who want to sit in the lobby after dinner.

It was great to have a full size refridgerator to use. My only real complaint (and what kept it from being a perfect stay) is that the rooms have this very loud air filter that can't be turned off or quieted.

She is an aspiring actress and our plan was to attend several Broadway plays.First, the price for this location was pretty good considering location to Times Square and Broadway play houses. We could have been slightly farther north, but the rate would have been considerably higher.Second, the lobby had a nice feel and the staff was very warm, friendly and helpful. As we arrived on our upper floor, the hallways and room felt somewhat cramped for a suites hotel. My guess is that this was a remodel of a former hotel. Second generation space had the dimensions and feel of a much older hotel. Third - the room was well appointed and the bathroom was OK for two occupants, but not what I would call generous. My bed was a queen, but my daughters bed was a fold out love seat. The size was fine for her, but it was separated from my bed by about 6 inches. If you are looking for a suite with room separation (like an Embassy Suite), this room would be disappointing.Fourth - the ACE subway, which runs north /south under 7th Street, was our access to Broadway. Unfortunately, the closest 2 stations were three blocks south (34th St) at Penn Station and 5 blocks north (42 St) a block west of Times Square. This made it fairly useless from a choice perspective and we ended up walking the five blocks north instead of using the train. However, the 34th St station is a useful station if traveling elsewhere in Manhattan. Penn station is also convenient if traveling in from another city.Overall, It was a fairly good stay, better than average location and a pretty good overall value.","Charleston, South Carolina, United States","Randy578</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charleston, South Carolina, United States</strong>",1,3.0

Sofabed is as uncomfortable as you would expect (has ANYBODY figured out how to make those comfortable yet? How about an electric inflatable mattress ?)Second, the interconnecting room door is in the bedroom instead of the living room. The neighbors were talking in normal voices and i could still hear every word they were saying.The free buffet was average/good but crowded. Only 3 very busy elevators, lots of waiting morning and evening. Recommendations: don't stay there if you are planning on using the sofabed, and ask for a non-interconnecting room. Also, if you can ask for a room the 2nd floor, you can take the stairs and avoid the elevator.

The roof terrace is a lovely place to have a drink and eat goodies from Chelsea Market while watching the sun go down.A few problems - our first room on the fourth floor but had an interconnecting door and the family in the next room were very loud till very late. It sounded like they were in the room with us. We asked to move but they didn't have another twin bed room that night so suggested we ask again in the morning. The next day the front desk staff confirmed they would move us so we packed everything apart from the clothes on hangers, as we were promised that they could be moved as they were. We came home late that evening to find the move had not taken place and it appeared we'd been forgotten, however the tip we'd left for the porter had been taken. The Duty Manager Melissa was extremely apologetic but again couldn't get us a twin room so we opted to move to a King with a guarantee of a move to a twin the following day. Melissa also arranged for a complimentary car to take us to the airport when we left. Our third move went as planned and the room was perfect apart from the toilet blocking on two occasions however this was dealt with fairly swiftly.Noise levels from the street, air con, refrigerator and other guests is intrusive so if you are sensitive like me, I suggest ear plugs. They have them on reception ready so I presume they are used to complaints.We felt a bit unlucky having the issues we experienced but Melissa was a star and we felt she did all she could to resolve things for us.

Although some reviewers here state that the rooms are small, for midtown Manhattan these rooms are *well* above standard size...even the Studio Suites. Even the most basic of rooms have almost all the luxuries of an upscale condominium. The rooms are modern and trendy, and the design is incredibly thoughtful. Kitchens are fully equipped and you can do everything just short of baking cookies. The appliances are new and spotless, and include a large fridge. I can't tell you how lovely it is to have a freezer full of ice, real glasses, and the ability to have evening drinks in the comfort of your room.The beds are plush with crisp white sheets and multiple pillows. There is a desk with a comfortable chair. The wifi is free, strong and reliable, with an option to purchase premium internet access if you desire. In my studio there was an abundance of storage with a built in closet (which had shelves), 3 large drawers, a luggage rack as well as a digital safe.The room has easily accessible power outlets for charging multiple devices, and they are thoughtfully located. You have so many lighting options in the room that you can set the mood you'd like...something unavailable in most properties! There are bedside lamps, an under-cabinet kitchen light, a ceiling light, a desk light, living room lamp as well as hallway lighting....even the bathroom has the vanity light as well a recessed and nicely diffused shower light. The bathroom itself is spacious with upgraded fixtures, toilets with single and double-flush options as well as the absolute best water pressure I've ever experienced in a Manhattan hotel. I felt like I was at the spa everyday.There are also small touches to the room that truly make the space feel like your own. A series of wall shelves invite you to customize them.... and as my trips usually involve seeing many Broadway shows I add a Playbill to my shelf every night of my stay.The business center is well equipped with 2 lighting-fast computers, a printer, office supplies in a comfortable setting. The adjacent laundry room is convenient and a wonderful thing to have on site. The fitness facility is large and clean, with premium equipment, televisions and everything you need to keep active.Breakfast is free and has a nice selection of items. Dinner is also free (Monday through Thursday evenings) with varied offerings each night. For my stay I was treated to dishes such as chicken and shrimp stir-fry, pasta with meatballs and grated cheese, and artichoke dip with flat-breads. Your alcoholic beverage is also complimentary with your dinner (beer or wine).I will say that this property has spent a great deal of money on their common areas and accommodation, and it shows. Even details like the well-appointed hallways on the guest floors and the public areas on the lower lever remind you of this.Finally, I have to say that the staff are wonderful and accommodating. Nafeesa at the front desk was always there to make my stay right and is a tremendous front desk employee.Thank you Nafeesa, for everything! The rest of the front desk team was warm and welcoming, the restaurant staff were pleasant and my housekeeping attendant was fantastic. This hotel has become my favorite property in New York CIty, and come to think of it I've actually never had a hotel surpass my satisfaction and expectations as much as this one did (and continues to do).Skip the ""full-service"" hotels and book the Homewood for your next stay in Manhattan.

They were eager to assist at check-in or at any time when I had a question or needed something. My room was very modern and included everything I needed. There were a significant number of conveniently placed outlets for my electronics, the wifi in the room was very good, the bed was comfortable, the room itself was very clean and housekeeping did a nice job of cleaning the room.The breakfast was good...the food was fresh and plentiful. There were not a lot of choices in terms of hot items, but sometimes keeping it simple is how you maintain quality. The same could be said for the evening meal. I did not eat the evening meal...though I did want an appetizer before going out to dinner. A true appetizer was not available so I improvised from the dinner offering which is OK, but a true appetizer offering might be a place they could improve.I needed to do a bit of laundry while I was there. It is great that they have coin operated machines (and I believe that there are at least 4 sets of washers and dryers. That said, I found them to be very expensive. $5.00 to wash and dry...and an additional $3.99 for detergent for one load. I guess they want you to use their laundry service so they make this quite expensive. $9.00 a load seems pretty darn high to me. They have to be making a profit here, but making this a service and reducing the price, it is possible that they would get greater benefit in terms of customer satisfaction scores.

As many have stated, this hotel is fairly new (1 yr old) and so everything is in good shape. I stayed for two nights and only experienced a few minor issues. The rooms are small, and after checking in I realized the room I was given was actually slightly smaller than what I had booked (1 Bedroom Studio vs. 1 Bedroom with Sofa Bed). It seems there are actually at least 4 levels and sizes of rooms, but when booking it's not clear what you will get. For the price I paid, I did feel the room was a bit small and claustrophobic. The other issue was that my room was on the 9th floor and the floor below had outdoor decks which meant they could see right into my room at night! I quickly learned the need to keep the shades drawn at all times. Overall I felt the stay was good, but didn't jump out as exceptional. I think I would stay again if the price was a bit less, but otherwise might look for other options.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","Chris20874</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",57,3.0

The hotel is located a short walking distance to Penn Station, and Times Square. Very easy to get around town. Many food options around including Hells Kitchen which is just around the corner, with its blocks and blocks of ethnic restaurants. The evening managers reception/dinner is a nice touch. The breakfast was typical, nothing fancy but still somewhere to grab a quick bite if needed. If anyone is worried about outside noise, I will say that I had no complaints whatsoever. I stayed in room 1106, right next to the elevator. Never heard a sound. As for all the negative reviews, yes the elevators can get busy during peak time, yes the breakfast area can get crowded during peak time. But if you manage your time correctly you will never notice.

The rooms are large and clean, the breakfast is pretty good, and the staff are very pleasant...However, we had a big issue with their credit card hold policies, which meant that we were overcharged around $650 for the duration of the stay. On check-in (rooms weren't available for over two hours after the 3 pm opening time-slot, but that is another matter), we switched the credit card that held the two rooms for the booking, to other cards (one for each room) that would be used to pay for it. Despite this switch happening straight away at check-in, the hotel put a hold on the original card for the first night of both rooms (about $230 each), then put a hold on the new cards for the total amount, plus an additional $200.I understand that hotels need to cover themselves in case people book and don't show, but we did show, and were double charged for the experience. On speaking to the duty manager, we were told that it would be five days before it could be reversed, meaning that we are out of pocket $650 in the meantime.I'd recommend the hotel, but after this experience, I don't think we will be back.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","iain_scott81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",2,2.0

The balcony was a real preference as we love to sit outside first thing in the morning with a coffee and breakfast so when we found the Homewood suites we thought we had found everything we wanted from a hotel. Sadly for some bizarre reason the balcony has water sprinklers placed either side of the patio door which are on a timer...from 6.00am until 7.30am every morning. There are no plants or grass to water so all that is watered are the windows the fencing and most annoyingly the terrace furniture which is then rendered useless to use for breakfast time. The first morning we were totally unaware of the sprinklers but we were soon in for a rude awakening as we got soaked whilst on the balcony. Have asked at reception if there was anything they could do to turn them off and was assured the company who deals with them would have it sorted by this morning...guess what.. 6am woken to the sound of water hammering on the windows again...not impressed we paid extra for a balcony we can't use at a time that suits.

I tried this Homewood Suites because of ots location in Midtown and close walk to B'way shows. 37 Street & 8th Avenue - in the garment district which os a kick with the speciality stores and galleries featuring fashions and sewing crafts. Interesting neigborhood. The hotel is Hilton's idea of a new millenium minimalist hotel room. Small - I had to go into the hallway to change my mind! The room fits a full kitchen [fridge, freezer, dish wash, microwave, stove top and prep sink - all in a 6' space, directly adjacent to the bed, which is adjacent to the 2-person divan. Tat's not too bad - abot the size of a cruise ship cabin. BUT...the closet is 12"" wide! and half of that was taken up by the ironing board and iron mount [we had Housekeeping take ours out]. We travel for casual and dressy in NYC...the closet is important - this one sucks! we have clothes all over the room because there is no closet room - BAD feature. Also, I like privacy on the potty - do yo? well, the bathroom is less than tiny, the shower very narrow, and so is sink. the worse art however, is a slider door to close the bathroom off from the rooom - doesn't work because the dooor does not 'seat' closed; the door hangs outside the bathroom wall, so if you pass gas inside it is easily heard outside. Imagine the embarrassment or the lack of privacy in the potty! This is terrible choice as is the fact the small bathroom is not user friendly - no hooks, no place to put your toiletries, no place for anything! This is not the way I travel. We like the convenience of a full and private bath, and a room large enough to relax withoout falling over eachother. It may be fine for the saleman or single traveller, or the young couple on a spree - but at nearly $400 per night it leaves omething to be desired in a full room. We got lucky and reserved a room on the 8th floor with a patio - really, with grass and a table and chairs overlooking 37th street - at least we could escape the confines of the room [even with the construction on the highrise bldg across the street so I got to know some of the construction workers when I went out to smoke a cigar!] - One other GOOD thing they serve a fairly good breakfast everymorning for free [egg somethings, meat and potatoes, some fruit and lots of pastries - none gluten-free however] and on Monday-to-Thurday they serve a 'dinner' from 5-7 also free with dishes such as hamburger night, pastas and salad...a real nice touch + coffee/tea/hot chocolate 24/7, and sell booze from a cart. In all a very mixed bag - good locale, nice property & staff, and free food [well you pay for it in the room rate] - but hate the room, bathroom and the fact the room lacks convenience and storage. It obviously appeals to foreigner & their families who were over 60% of the guest the week we stayed [everything is smaller in Europe]..You make the call based on this - I will pass next time!","South Lake Tahoe, California","Neal S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Lake Tahoe, California</strong>",246,4.0

I can affirm that by my many stays in that city. This Homewood Suites was surprisingly liveable and clean -- a rare find in a city with some of the most awful hotels in the country.. I was upgraded, so I hope my room was typical of the others. I did indeed have a modern two room suite, with a large living room/dining room/kitchen area and a separate bedroom -- all nicely appointed. The kitchen, in fact, had a full size refrigerator -- a true rarity! Both rooms had large-screen HD televisions. Unfortunately the TV reception was spotty and needs to be investigated and repaired. The reception desk was very friendly and helpful. All staff were friendly and helpful. Another positive surprise was the late afternoon cocktail hour/dinner service with real food, complimentary! A full and fine buffet breakfast was also included. Coffee and beverages seem available all day. The main ""but"" is that my upgraded suite was on the second floor -- above the noisy atrium lobby. The noise in my room was often deafening and tailed off somewhat late night. Being New York, there was lots and lots of street noise as well. In short, be sure to book a high floor to avoid the noise. The atrium rises only to the second floor. The neighborhood, off shabby 8th Avenue, is also a bit dark late at night, but should be ok. On the plus side, it's not far from Times Square and Madison Square Garden. All in all, this hotel could be a real find if you avoid the second floor.

Fantastic hotel, staff were friendly, professional and very helpful. (Loved how the reception desk staff always welcomed us back into the hotel on our return from a days sightseeing). Hotel was very busy but check in was quick and room as was ready before 2pm. Room itself (613) exceeded my expectations (NY hotel rooms are notoriously small); this was large, modern and very clean. 2 queen size beds, floor to ceiling windows, work area with large chair and pull out desk, separate sofa and seating area, mini kitchen with fridge, hob, dishwasher, microwave, crockery/cutlery etc. Large modern bathroom with shower over bath, great lighting, good storage space, plenty of towels and toiletries. HD tv and free, fast & efficient wifi. Breakfast was included (as was evening meal & wine/beer on the 4 nights we were there - an added bonus as this saved us a fortune on eating out at night) Breakfast, fruit juices, choice of cereals, fresh fruit, toast, bagels, pastries, muffins, scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes. Free tea and coffee in reception area 24 hours a day. I agree with some of the comments about the breakfast area being busy but we never had to wait for a table, any queues for food were no longer than 4 or 5 people, the main problem at meal times is some people's inability to queue or to take ages as they were piling their plates so high you'd think they hadn't eaten for a week. Not the staff's fault at all, they were superb, constantly bringing out fresh food and clearing away tables after the people who obviously thought this was beneath them (this did wind me up as it was set up so that it was easy to clear away after yourself and meant new diners were coming into clear tables rather than having to wait for someone else to clear it away) Not much of a view from the room but this didn't bother us, the building is only 22 floors high and in a highly built up area you're not going to get much of a view. But the roof terrace is lovely and there are some great views from up there. Made use of the gym area, this was well equipped - treadmills, bikes, cross trainers, weights etc, water machine and plenty of towels. There's a free guest laundry too which is open 24 hrs. We also made use of the business centre facility, great for checking in online and printing boarding cards before our return journey. Great location, 5 minute walk from Macys, 10-15 min walk from Times Square.

However, if you are located on one of the top floors, be prepared to wait a while for the lifts as they would often take their time.

My intentions were to get this done several weeks early but I'm glad I didn't. FIrst I used Booking.com for my hotels with Trip advisor as my backup check. I'll tell you that you have to keep checking because room rates change within hours. I was able to snag this property for under 175/night. And that is for a king efficiency, complete with a fridge, freezer, 2 burner stove, sink, great shower and a totally updated room....the room had knotted pine floors for gods sake....yes the room is small, and we didn't have a view, but it's mid town in one of the most incredible cities in the world. There were three of us (wife, son (8) and me..and oh, did I mention that we had a pull out sofa bed as well?? Being from NY, i was leary of a room so close to Penn Sta or the bus terminal...But not a problem at all. Was quiet, the front desk people were absolutely great and service was super friendly. Every morning, there was a full on breakfast....hot scrambled eggs, sausage, some sort of potatoes and the reg, breads, oatmeals, ceraels, yogurts.....All inclusive of the room rate....and if you're there mon-thurs, there's a complimentary cocktail reception and food as well......totally impressed. Room was done up in modern decor. Really nice and looked recently refurbished...Fresh complimentary coffee throughout the day and close by places to eat.....Even more importantly, and i did feel guilty about not taking advantage of the bkfst, but when i'm in nyc i HAVE to have a Bacon, egg and cheese sandwich to start my am off! and there was a place right around the corner on 8th called the international kitchen that delivered...all 3 of us ate each morning for under 9 dlrs!! 2 eggs, cheese and bacon on a fresh hard roll.....People may point you to an italian place, amalfis or something like that but it was a bit more expensive than the international kitchen, plus they had a build your own salad bar as well....Clientele were really diverse, lots of europeans and south americans which is always great, makes for meeting lots of interesting people, families as well but not so many that it was jamming with kids running all over the place...So in conclusion, great place, use tripadvisor or booking.com for your room rate, stay here, eat breakfast here or go to the place i mentioned.....There's also a 7 11 around the corner so you can pick up some libations and other perfect with a beer processed food snacks!

Bed is comfy and room has all the usual offerings so...Onto those little things...LED light on the front door light panel so even if it's pitch black, you know exactly where the switch is (no more miming along the wall to find it).Fan...when was the last time you had a room with a ceiling fan in it?! Righteous.Foot rest in the shower...FTW! Sounds like nothing but so useful in a smallish shower stall...ladies are gonna love this, trust me.Pull out desk...I've started to see this featured in more & more rooms and it's great for business travelers who want to work and watch TV at the same time, but not face into the wall.HDTV: yes 99.78% of hotels have flat panel TV's now but I still find soooo many don't bother to actually give you HD channels! They do here, killer picture & channels including HBO.Wifi: zippy and free.Elevator numbers: floor numbers are listed for each bank so you know exactly how fast (or slow) an elevator is coming. Only a couple negatives to report, but one's a biggie...I would have given this property 4 stars but had to take one away as I left a portable speaker behind in my room and after several calls & attempts to retrieve it, I didn't even get the courtesy of a response from staff!! #EpicFail One other thing to know, the compact elevators are very, very crowded during the morning rush...it typically took me 3 or 4 different attempts (or about 10 mins) just to get one with room!

We did not hear street noise at night. Food: The breakfast offered decent options to get us started - eggs, sausage/bacon, potatoes; cold cereals and oatmeal; fresh fruit; yogurt; beverages. The area does get busy but we never waited long and we never waited for food to be replenished. Service: The front desk staff were very professional, prompt and helpful. Location: A couple of blocks from subways and Penn Station. Access to taxis is plentiful. Not the prettiest neighborhood in NYC, but busy and safe. All in all, this is a solid go-to hotel if you want a comfortable, clean, and convenient hotel in midtown.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina","EHolly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chapel Hill, North Carolina</strong>",22,5.0

Our room was nicely decorated, the beds were comfortable, the kitchenette was well equipped and the bathroom was very clean. We had everything we needed and there was no noise problem. OK the room wasn't huge and our view was of another building, but we certainly weren't cramped and as we were out everyday, the lack of view didn't bother us. There's a good view from the roof on 22nd floor though. The complimentary hot drinks in the lobby are a nice touch, breakfasts were good, and the complementary supper (Mon-Thurs) including wine/beer was a welcome bonus when we were too exhausted to go out after a hard days' shopping and sightseeing. The staff were always pleasant and helpful and although we didn't use them, I believe there was a laundry and gym in the basement, available to guests.

We had both always wanted to go to New York and obviously wanted to make sure the whole holiday was perfect, so we had spent a lot of time hunting for the best hotel and this hotel couldn't have been more perfect! We arrived and were greeted by a very friendly bunch of reception staff. My partner had emailed to ask for a room with a view, unfortunately this was not put through, but that was our fault more than theirs really. After checking in we went straight up to our room and we were so impressed! The room was fantastic - Modern, clean, bright room, massive bed, lovely bathroom, full size fridge freezer, tea, coffee, hot chocolate and microwave popcorn. We were over the moon! We arrived around 4pm so by the time we had settled in, it was time for Dinner. Reading some of the reviews before we went we weren't expecting much - it was complimentary after all - however the food was lovely. The only downside if that you have to eat off of polystyrene plates and with plastic cutlery... but that isn't the end of the world. We were also able to keep some stuff in the fridge in our room so this kept the cost of food down. There is also tea, coffee and hot chocolate available by the reception area (I believe this is 24 hours). Give one of the hot chocolates a go - I preferred it over the Starbucks hot choc! The breakfast was also lovely, just your typical american sausage, scrambled egg, potato hash, toast that kind of thing; as well as cereal, porridge, fruit etc.The rooms were cleaned daily, linen changed and restock of supplies. Reading some of the reviews before we went, we were a bit worried about the lift waiting times as this had been mentioned by quite a few people. This was not a problem for us at all. Over the 6 nights we were there, we did not wait anymore than 1 minute, so this was not a problem. The hotel also has free WiFi, a gym, computer room, laundry room and small shop.It is in a perfect location, not far from the heart of time square but was far enough away for us to not be kept awake by the New Year Celebrations. They have their own taxi service, which was much nicer than to travel in rather one of the crazy yellow cabs! The drivers in the yellow cabs drive like they want to kill themselves, so I would definitely recommend using the hotel taxi service. Its also only about $5 more to go in one of their lovely, comfy taxis.

The lobby, room and bathroom were all very well presented with current, modern furnishings. The room we had included a King bed and a twin size pullout sofa with a small kitchenette with stainless steel appliances. Though we did not use the kitchen other than to make tea, it was nice to have the extra sink while we were getting ready. Coffee, tea and microwave popcorn were provided in the room. Coffee and tea are always available in the Lobby and breakfast is served each morning and consisted of eggs, breakfast meat, potatoes, cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, some fruit and several bread items and juices. Being situated between 8th and 9th Avenue, the street noise was not unbearable. It is New York after all and you will hear sirens and horns no matter where you are. We did not interact with the staff much; however, when passing them in hall or on elevator, they always spoke. There is not a doorman and taxis are not waiting outside the hotel so you have to walk to one of the Avenues to catch a taxi. Times Square is a few blocks away as is Macy's. Walk to Rockefeller Plaza and Theatre District is 20 minutes. Walk to Chelsea is 25 - 30 minutes. This is my fourth stay in NYC and each time has been at a different hotel.

We usually stay downtown, but we had tickets to an event at Madison Square Garden, and this hotel was walking distance. Everything about the hotel was great from the moment we arrived. The staff said our room was not ready yet (we arrived about an hour after the check-in time) but this is not unusual for busy NYC hotels. What WAS unusual, was the great attitude of the front desk personnel. It was about 10 minutes (with free coffee and hot chocolate) later that we were given our room keys. Pretty quick, in my experience. The room itself was specious, not just by NYC standards, and not only had a full kitchenette (burners and everything) but also service for 4, pots and pans, and even storage containers. Small details, but I have stayed in other places with a ""kitchenette"" that had no way to cook anything. Nothing in this hotel is an afterthought. The room was clean, the bed comfy, the bathroom up to date and comfortable. There was a sofabed near the window that could have been used by a 3rd person.Also offered, M-TH, was a ""reception"" that included not only beer, wine, and soft drinks, but basically a full dinner. We had hamburgers and salad, and it was quite good (in addition to saving us at least $30-50 that evening, as we had planned to just keep it simple anyway). Breakfast was very good, too. The eggs did not seem artificial (like in many hotel breakfast buffets) and there was fruit, yogurt, cereal, and an assortment of breads. Also, the juice was fresh. ***A big Thank You here, to Carmen, who was working at the breakfast and got me ""To Go"" containers so that I could bring food up for my still-sleeping son. I stupidly spilled orange juice because I was trying to balance it, and Carmen got me a tray, and suggested that I use the coffee cups that had lids. She did this all with a smile. AWESOME employee among awesome employees*** There was free, fast Wi-Fi, too. And all of this was included in the very good price we paid. I highly recommend this hotel, especially for people who need to be around Midtown. It was far enough away from Times Square to be calm, but close enough that if you want to go there, it takes about 5 minutes walking. It is about 15 minutes walk to Penn Station, less, depending on which part you need. I will stay here again. My only wish is that it were farther downtown, as that is where we usually like to stay-do things. Still, it is worth the short cab or Subway ride by a long-shot to stay in this Hotel. Everyone was great, the facility was great, and the value was excellent.

There was a full kitchenette with a two-burner stove, a medium-sized refrigerator/freezer, a small (but nice) dishwasher, sink, and microwave. They also provided pots, pans, plates, bowls, and utensils so that was a great thing. If you want to save money and/or cook healthy, these rooms can be a bargain. There are a few grocery stores and drug stores in the area, so it is easy to get food should you wish to cook in your room. The complimentary full breakfast was also nice; they had a variety of hot and cold foods. I, however, suggest going to breakfast first thing in the morning because it can get very crowded if you go later. The lobby is beautiful with a surround fireplace, a large wall fountain, and an overall welcoming atmosphere. The staff is always eager to help in anyway they can.

We heard no street noise; none. King size bed plus a sofa (pulls out for another bed), desk, kitchenette, nicely appointed bathroom. Nothing in the room not to like. Breakfast in the morning was cramped and rushed. The breakfast area is just not large enough and it is understaffed. There were insufficient utensils and buffet items were not replenished.

There are two small tables and including the sofa the necessary seatings for three.There is daily cleaning.Coffee, tea etc is available in the studio, but we used the free coffee station in the lobby - 24/7 fresh coffee incl. decaf and Robusta plus tea and coco.There is a nice free gym in the basement.Breakfast was fine - cereals, oatmeal, different hot dishes, orange and apple juice, toast, bagels, jam, Philadelphia etc. No cut meat or sliced cheese - but it was no problem.Monday to Thursday we had free dinner between 5 and 7. It could be soup and a hot dish - plain and simple, but nice to have before theatre etc. Free beer and wine included !The hotel was sold out, but we didn´t have problems finding a free table for breakfast or dinner, but some of the guests took the meals into the studio.After check out the reception took care of our luggage until departure.The hotel is situated near Penn Station and only 5 minutes from 42nd Street - perfect.We definitely recommend this hotel - good quality, reasonable prices, breakfast included, dinner incl. drinks Mo-Th.

The rooms are pretty spacious for NYC! They have a full kitchen and a small couch in each room. I literally had real walking room in my room, and anyone who has stayed in NYC hotels knows that rooms are literally the size of a closet! Lol! There was complimentary breakfast every morning that was really good. Also a 24 rooftop terrace that over looks the Hudson. The location was perfect!

It's about five blocks from Penn Station and in a fast-gentrifying bit of midtownReception is friendly, knowledgeable and efficient. I was given 2pm checkout (with my Diamond card) without any quibbling, which is not always the case at HiltonsMy suite (2011) was big and very well decorated. I had an excellent view looking north over the skyscapers. The two design flaws are, first, that the door goes directly from the studio room (albeit the opposite end from the bed) onto the hall. This means there is some hallway noise -- I only noticed it on Superbowl night but I can imagine that you could be unlucky if you had noisy neighbours. The corner rooms might be a bit better; those opposite and behind the elevators would probably be worse. Second, the laminate floors look very nice but -- predictably -- you can sometimes hear people walking on the floor above you.The mini-kitchen was really well equipped with dishes, knives, saucepans and glasses. The full-size refrigerator was great and the microwave was -- if anything -- a bit too sophisticated (it took some working out). My only complaint is that there is no waste bin for food so, if you cook, you'll end up with food waste in the main room waste basketThe bathroom was big, spacious and well lit with a nice large shower enclosure and no lethal, slippery bath. Very impressiveThere is a nice gym downstairs with about 15 pieces of equipment. I didn't use it as I wanted more weights but it looked great (I went to the Mid City Gym on 42nd Street which cost $60 for 5 sessions and had as much equipment as I wanted)I went to the supermarket so I didn't eat the breakfast or at the evening reception.

Every single staff member (and there were plenty of them) went out of their way to talk to guests and make sure their needs were being met. They actually seemed to enjoy their job (which certainly isn't easy when they are probably not earning much)!

My partner and I spent 9 days in NYC over Christmas and New Year, and this hotel really boosted our experience from a good one to an exceptional one. From the moment we arrived (late in the evening), the desk staff were polite, kind, friendly. They explained all of the facilities available in the hotel - Free WIFI, free breakfast every morning, free evening meal from Mon thru Thursdays with alcoholic drinks (they even served on Christmas Day), free coffee in the foyer 24/7. The guy on the desk also asked if we had a preference of floors - we asked for a high floor (because we hoped for a view). We were delighted to be placed on the top floor, (there are only around 5 rooms on this floor) for no extra cost. The top floor also boasts a large, yet tidy and landscaped roof terrace with a view of the Empire State building's spire. We felt like we'd got the penthouse! It was such a shame that the majority of the guests seemed to only use this space as a smoking area - we made it our business to tell other guests about it when we shared the elevator - definitely worth checking out!During our stay it was also my partner's 30th birthday and I contacted the front desk asking if they could secretly put a cake in the room for me while we were out. This was absolutely no trouble for Allyson, who very efficiently sorted it all out, asking what type of cake and what budget to remain within. On my partner's birthday we came back to the room and there it was in the fridge - and it was delicious!In terms of the hotel environment, as you can see from the pictures, the hotel is very modern and new. It has been recently (June 2014 I believe) acquired by Hilton and fully refurbished throughout. I can confirm that the reality matches the photos shown here, it is very new, clean and comfortable, with tasteful fresh and modern decor. As far as we were concerned, it felt like a brand new hotel.Other things that positively surprised us:- The fitness suite, which was a very nice environment to have a work-out in. The equipment was new, clean, and there was cold water available from a cooler and clean towels. There are treadmills, cardiovascular cross trainers, free weights, and a cable machine which can be used to tone the whole body in the absence of your usual fitness suite while you're on vacation.- Free ice dispensers in the hallways on chosen floors (one right outside our door actually), for guest use.If I had to give one negative it would simply be that on the 22nd floor you do sometimes have yo wait a while for the elevator. The hotel has a bank of 3x elevators but at busy times (breakfast and evening meal) you can wait up to 5 minutes for an elevator to reach the 22nd floor and it often takes a while to descend due to having to make 6 or 7 stops. However I appreciate there is not a lot Hilton can do about this. Also we did visit at a busy festive time and the hotel was clearly very full, so we found it acceptable.Just a quick final word on location - I have to admit I was very pleasantly surprised with the location of the hotel, which i wasn't expecting having read some reviews before our trip. It was a 10-minute walk from the craziness of Times Square, but it was just far enough away to get away from the crowds when you wanted. 34th St Penn station is the closest subway, just out of the street and to the left for a couple of streets. The station is on the red line meaning its really easy to get downtown or Central Park in just a few stops. Madison Square Garden is visible from the end of the street that the hotel is situated on, and trendy areas like Hell's Kitchen are within 20-30 mins' walking distance if you're a walker.","Dunstable, United Kingdom","BradleyW450</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dunstable, United Kingdom</strong>",10,5.0

The hotel is in a very good location, a few blocks from Times Square. You have a pharmacy store and Donuts/coffee shop in the corner.Front desk was very helpful. This is a new hotel. The room was nice and clean. Had it's own kitchenette with goodies and a couch to relax. Good A/C and heater. It had free wifi but I'm an HHonors Gold member so I'm not sure if it is free for all guest, but it is available.The bed was large and comfy but wobbly. Not sure if it was because of the wood floor but the bed would move around. The best part is the hotel has free breakfast and free dinner with free wine and beer. Yes you read that right, and it wasn't anything cheap it was the good stuff. So if you're traveling on a budget this would be great because you can have two light meals for free. I took advantage of this two out of my three days by coming back for dinner, rested up a little then headed out again.Another thing I would like to mention is the rooms have new locks that instead of using magnet strip cards they use RFID cards. The benefit is you won't be locked out of your room because your card was demagnetized. I hate it when that happens. All you want to do is get in your room and now you have to go to the front desk and hope their is no long line.The cons - The only thing I can think of is the bed, although it was not uncomfortable. The closet was smaller then usual but I don't unpack much so that didn't really bother me.I would highly recommend this hotel!

Few things to make note of: our room would not have fit more than 2 people comfortably (though it was quite comfortable and even roomy for the two of us); the breakfast Monday morning was extremely crowded (we went around 10am; breakfast is served from 6-10:30am), to the point where we shared a table with two strangers; lastly, there was no ice machine on our floor, only every few floors, so we had to walk down one flight to get ice. On the plus side, the front desk was very helpful, both when we dropped our bags off early (our room wasn't ready early), when we came back to check in, when we bought ice cream and snacks later, and the next morning when we checked out.

The room was a nice size and accommodated the 4 of us very well, loved the hard wood flooring and mini kitchen area, however for 4 women there weren't enough mirrors and the lighting wasn't ideal for applying makeup, etc. With that being said, my real frustration was with housekeeping... as stated before the room was very nice, however, certain locations hadn't been dusted in a VERY long time, (ex). ceiling fan and underneath tables, but the most frustrating thing was the lack of an English speaking housekeeping staff (or the ones they kept sending to our room), it was a bit frustrating after a few attempts to get our room cleaned and fresh towels and wash clothes for 4; they didn't understand us and we didn't understand them.We also had a situation in our bathroom closet. Looked like something (maybe a rolled up dirty sock) had been left on a bottom shelf way in the back, and it started to smell really bad after showers, so we called downstairs, no one came up (said they did and we didn't answer the door which was not true); called again and no one ever came and WE were not touching whatever it was.Anywho, we enjoyed our trip and the hotel in spite of the few housekeeping issues.Would definitely stay again!",Upper Darby,"Tanya A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Upper Darby</strong>",25,4.0

Check in was quick, staff behaviour really nice and the room was as expected (quite big and comfortable). We were informed about complimentart breakfast and free dinner. During our stay we had no problem with staff or room. Negative aspects: 1) when you have breakfast or light dinner at a Hilton and pay more than $300 per night (incl. taxes) the least you expect is not to eat with plastic cutlery and paper plates. It might be one of the busiest periods of the year but service has to be all-year round similar (friends have stayed and suggested this hotel in September and their experience was totally different). 2) We checked-out at 11am, the staff arranged a car to get us at the airport for 5:30pm and left our luggage to be stored. When we got back to the hotel at 5pm, we asked for our luggage. At 5:20pm we asked again the reception what's going on and they told us that we have to wait for another 5min since they were other clients waiting for their luggage. At 5:30pm we asked again and still were asked to wait because it is a very busy time of the day for the staff and the elevators were busy (first time we hear this excuse!). We told them that we are willing to go and get the luggage from the storage room by ourselves but we were told that this is not allowed. The two ladies at the reception (Alyson and a red-hair with no badge) had completely different approach and behaviour. Alyson was really kind trying to sort everything out. The other one was completely arrogant with no intention to be of any help. Finally our luggage arrived at 5:45pm and after being told by a hotel staff that he is willing to show us where the stairs are! It is the second time we leave a Hilton hotel dissatisfied and more probably will not choose to stay again at a Hilton, especially when there is a wide range of hotels offering similar or even superior service for the same rate.","Athens, Greece","ilias_and</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Athens, Greece</strong>",6,3.0

The room was a little smaller than expected but new, clean and comfortable and included a full size fridge, microwave and mini stove top. The facilities were great and included a laundry, unfortunately there aren't many machines and we did have to wait a while. There was a also a business centre where we printed off tickets and confirmations free of charge. The small convenience store in the lobby was helpful for a drink and snack and there was complimentary coffee, hot chocolate and tea available 24hrs a day. We were offered complimentary breakfast 7 days a week and dinner Mon - Fri. The breakfast selection was ok and included hot and cold items as well as pastries and cereal. Dinner was quite early (5-7pm) and there weren't too many items to choose from but it was great to have the options of dining in. I read in another review that the restaurant serves food on plastic plates but we didn't mind, they even have the option of take out containers which you can take back to your room if you don't want to eat in the restaurant.  We like the location as we were only a short walk to the subway and Times Square.

We arrived at Penn station via Amtrak, and walked just a few short blocks to the hotel. After check-in, which was fast and efficient, we headed back out for an easy walk to Times Square. Many other sites were also within reasonable walking distance. And for longer trips, there's always a nearby subway station. The staff provided a hot breakfast every day, AND dinner - DINNER! This is something they offer M-TH, which happened to be when we were there. It wasn't anything elaborate - just simple food, but it was good and it was included. They even gave us dinner on Christmas day. The staff did an amazing job feeding so many people during the very busy holiday season, and kept the tea-coffee area clean and well-stocked. Our room was different the standard layout, and of course included an apartment sized refrigerator, and dishes. We lacked for nothing. The only thing that needs improvement is the elevator algorithm. I don't think it was working as intended since it often missed the 21st floor, yet would stop at every other floor to which it was called, even when stuffed completely full of people. Even so, I would definitely stay here again.","Durham, North Carolina","teric260</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durham, North Carolina</strong>",1,5.0

Nice modern furnishings.Not so good ZERO Christmas spirit some music, Carol singers or SOMETHING would help. Didn't feel like Christmas staying there at all. I stayed with a three year old child. Meal times were a joke, served on polystyrene plates with plastic knives and forks. No Christmas dinner and no Vegetarian options except watery soup, mostly the same one daily. Christmas dinner was stir fry beef and rice. The dining room does not accommodate the amount of people the hotel holds so had to retreat to bedroom with meals, not easy with a toddler, plates and drinks, no trays provided. Same at breakfast times even by getting there first thing, nowhere to sit, so by the time you've waited for an elevator your food is cold. Tea and coffee in Foyer often empty. The room seemed clean but wouldn't recommend rooms at the back although quieter from street noise they were very claustrophobic and look onto office blocks with very noisy aircon units. On leaving and retrieving lost toys (under the bed) were pretty horrified at the inches of dust under it. Also the hotel takes dogs, One had a bad accident outside our room which made the corridor stink and I think the carpet must have fleas as returned with some ankle bites. It was ok but having worked for Hilton I expected more from the Brand. The reception staff were great, couldn't do more to help and allowed us a late check out, the food staff very sultry.

We walked to Times Square, Empire State Building, Central Park, and the Rockefeller Center without too much trouble, and being situated between Penn Station and the Port Authority Bus Terminal meant that jumping on the subway to get home, or somewhere further away was dead easy.Our room was a little small, particularly as we needed the sofa bed down, but it was clean and well maintained. It came with a fridge / freezer, sink and microwave.Breakfast is included, as well as a light dinner served Mon-Thurs 5 to 7. Don't expect culinary excellence, but if you're on a budget it helps keep costs down, and is OK. The things that weren't so good? Our room wasn't ready when we turned up at 1 (which was fine, we were early) and we were asked to come back at 3. Returned at 4.30 and still had to wait for Housekeeping to confirm the room was ready.  Trying to get a seat for Breakfast or Dinner is tricky, and many people end up taking their plates back up to their rooms. And finally, our room was noisy. Despite unplugging the fridge and turning the heating off, there was still a constant buzzing in the room, which I assume is the ventilation system. It was loud enough to be disturbing when trying to sleep.Overall these were minor issues though, and I'd be happy to return here if I ever came back.",Hants,"Handy_Harry</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hants</strong>",54,5.0

The hotel offers free hot breakfast in the morning and also for weeknights a light dinner consisting of soup, salad bar, and bread with juices for the kids and wine or beer for adults which was a nice treat after walking the city for hours. We still ended up getting a slice of pizza each later at a nearby place but its hard to argue about anything when its free.

I generally like fuller service Hilton Hotels, but the cheaper properties can be of excellent value. When I booked this 3-day 2-night stay in October, the best rates were at this Homeward Suites. Reviews were good so I took a chance. I was not disappointed. The hotel is 'new'. The 'studio' rooms (with one comfortable king-side bed) are small but cozy, and they do feature a small compact kitchen set-up with utentils, plates, cups, glasses, coffee maker, refrig, dishwater (!) and even tupperware. Kitchen was shiny and new. Shower had great pressure and lots of hot water. I could see this would be an excellent option for an extended stay, but it was also fine for a 2-night stay.The hotel is located on West 37th street between 8th and 9th avenues, blocks from Penn Station/Amtrak, close to Times Square, and there are lots of small restaurants and shops on 9th avenue, which retains its 'neighborhood' feeling.They offer free breakfast (which is very similar to Hampton Inn with styrofoam plates and cups). This is where I much prefer regular Hilton properties (or the Doubletree/Garden Inns) because as a Hilton Honors member I get the free breakfast, which is just better quality. But for families and those who are on budgets, the free breakfasts here can save lots of money. They also offer drinks and evening food Monday–Thursday. Since our stay was Friday–Sunday, we did not experience this.There is coffee and tea in the lobby that you can access 24-hours (I suppose), although it frequently ran out as the hotel was completely filled over the weekend. A minor annoyance.Desk staff and other staff were very polite and accommodating.

Also, could walk down stairs to the breakfast when the 3 elevators were busy.

Yes they had very nice dinner (more than just snacks) food choices M-TH that included salad and others items are listed on your frig for the week. Breakfast included cereals, some fruit (would like to have seen more fruit), usually a sausage or other meat choice, potato choice, bread, bagels, eggs, yogurt with fruit and nuts, and of course juices and milk. We visited in Dec. so the all time mini bar with hot teas, coffee, and hot chocolate was a nice touch in the lobby. The staff were all very nice and took the time to say hello.

In New York the noise is expected but I can honestly say that even being in the room next to the elevators I did not hear a thing.

During my stay, the whole hotel was spotless and staff were constantly on hand to clean and tidy.All the staff were polite, friendly and helpful.Check in was quick and easy, our room was ready and clean....The refrigerator was a little on the noisy side but when we turned the temperature down, we didn't notice it. It is not like we needed to stock it full of food as complimentary dinner was provided (during the week) and although this was not full menu with waiter service, for those in a rush or on a budget, it appeared adequate. We didn't take advantage of the food as we had made other arrangements but we did talk to other guests who had no complaints. Included with the complementary dinner was complementary drink, wine or beer.Also complimentary was the breakfast. We had breakfast every morning and although the dining room did get busy later on in the morning, it wasn't such that we had to go without.The location of the hotel is very close to all that Manhattan has to offer, Times Square, Broadway, Central Park. We used a taxi just twice in the week we were there. To take us from the airport and to take us to the airport.For any trips further afield I recommend the Hop On Hop Off buses. Check on here for the better companies.All in all a great hotel in a great location. We will be staying there again.",,Macn_12,3,5.0

For those that wish a slightly more in depth then please read review in its entirety.We travelled as a family of three between 14 - 19 Dec 2014 for a leisure break just before Christmas. The hotel was booked as part of a package with British Airways so I cannot comment on the hotels booking process. Check in was very efficient with friendly welcoming staff. The rooms are very spacious, we had a twin queen bed room equipped with small self cooking area. There is a complimentary breakfast every morning, and a complementary dinner Mon - Thu. Housekeeping a little hit and miss. The rooms are well soundproofed, and it is needed. Short walk to Times Square and close to shops if you wish to cook for yourself. Check out was again efficient with no problems. Overall I would recommend the hotel for those wishing a break in New York and wanting to be central to Manhattan. If you are looking for top class luxury then this hotel is not for you, but it delivers well on what it says it is, which is a three star comfortable and friendly hotel.More detail...The hotel is situated on 37 St West off 8th Avenue. The street, as with a lot of streets in New York, is quite dark due to the height of surrounding buildings, do not let this put you off as the hotel is modern warn and welcoming, we looked on Google Earth first. The surrounding area felt safe and you are only a minute away from 8th Avenue and a further 5 - 10 mins from Times Square. As the hotel website advises, there is no hotel parking if you are hiring a car. The hotel is modern and feels welcoming. Check in was smooth with very helpful staff. The rooms are well appointed and very spacious, although there is insufficient hanging space for clothes. The only place being in the bathroom. The beds are comfortable and all the usual facilities are available. The air conditioning is very controllable and works well. There is minimal noise from other rooms and this was despite being directly opposite the lifts. The building across the street is currently undergoing large renovation works, but you would not know unless you open the window or look outside, the sound proofing is very effective. The complementary breakfast, although I am sure you pay for it in the price of the room, is basic and for UK travellers equate it to a Holiday Inn Express breakfast. A couple of hot choices, with toast, porridge, fruits, cereals etc., it suited us fine. It can get busy from 0800 onwards and there is not a lot of seating, but you can take it back to your room if you wish. For those with younger children the access for push chairs etc. is fine although a little tight if the dinning area is busy. There is also free tea, coffee hot chocolate 24 hours in reception. That said a number of occasions there was no hot water, and on one occasion they ran out milk and had no more, odd as there were a number of shops close by. A minor thing but not difficult to get right. We did not take dinner at the hotel so cannot comment on that aspect. House keeping was initially good but the toiletries were not consistently replenished and the cleaning was only what could be seen, lift up the bed valance and the lack of attention was visible. Again not a major problem, but something that should be right. Checking out was smooth and you can leave your bags with the reception staff until ready to depart. The hotels strengths lie in the very friendly staff and the welcoming feel to the hotel. Where they could do better is in the minor details as mentioned above. If I was going back to New York, Manhattan, I would have no hesitation in staying at the Homewood Suites again.",Plymouth UK,"WelshFreebooter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plymouth UK</strong>",51,4.0

I stayed for two nights and, at the price point (under $200/night with a AAA discount, including taxes and fees), received great value. The booking includes free breakfast (buffet style) and although I didn't try it, free dinner as well (Monday through Thursday only).The room was clean and comfortable for what you might expect for a mid-tier hotel. It was also spacious (I've stayed in rooms half the size for the same price in Manhattan) and includes a kitchenette and decent sized refrigerator (not just a super mini one) if you are interested in having a meal in to save some cash.One notable downside was the noise from the central air system at night. We were on the 18th floor (I was hoping to stay high to avoid noise) and on the front side of the building. On the checkin info, there is a comment about turning down the refrigerator setting to avoid extra noise, which I tried, to no avail. I was also hoping for a view from this room, but it was blocked by a wall.","Boston, Massachusetts","kakapockets</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",2,4.0

We got to the hotel early and were not able to get into our rooms but the front desk staff checked our bags for us. They were very helpful with subway and restaurant directions. I stayed on the third floor facing 37th Street. The room was beautiful, appears to have recently been renovated. Very large rooms with full kitchens. The room temperature was fine for probably most people but I like my room very cold. The window opens about 2-3 inches which was great except for the fact that the room faced 37th Street and literally horns are honking all night long. I guess that's the price of staying in midtown! This was the first time I stayed there and for my next stay I would request a room that faces the courtyard in the back off of the street. The free breakfast buffet was typical of what you would find in most business hotels. I only had toast but the coworkers I was with ate eggs and sausage and enjoyed it. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are in the lobby all day long with is wonderful. We did go to the evening manager's reception. Two different type of beer were offered as well as wine. I had salad both nights but the co-workers I was with ate the dinner and enjoyed it. I would definitely stay here again. I found the front desk staff to be very helpful with directions and pleasant. It's in a very central location, only a short walk from Penn Station and not too far from Times Square and Rockefeller Center. We had to go to Penn Station to grab a subway. The hotel is in a weird spot to try and get a cab, you would need to walk to one of the cross streets. My room would have been fine for a family.

We were at breakfast by 7, so can't comment on if there was a wait as we didn't experience any. Only had one night of the included dinner (as we stayed over a weekend) and that was good too. Being environmentally conscious I was concerned by the use of throw away plates, cups etc at breakfast, although non disposable items were being used at dinner.

Honestly, I didn't have high expectations for this stay, so it wouldn't have been hard to meet my expectations, but I just was blown away by how accommodating and warm everyone at this property was. Every amenity you find at much trendier or expensive hotels is available here, and then some. It rained during my stay and I'd neglected to bring an umbrella. The front desk staff could have sold me one as they did have them for sale in their little store in the lobby but instead gave me the use of one of the hotel's umbrellas. Free coffee and tea all day and night, continental breakfast and dinner with wine were included in the cost of my room, making this a real steal in NYC!

The area around the food was quite dirty as well. We threw out our food and went a couple of blocks to the Tik Tock Diner which is very good. On the second evening the lobby was quite busy and a large group was waiting for the elevators, but on the last elevator there was a bellman holding it and preventing anyone from getting on. So it was quite a long wait about 15 minutes for the next elevator. Then the internet went out for most of the day and when I called down to see if they had an estimated time of when it would be back up and running I was told in a rude way that they have no idea.

The 'suites' were no bigger than any standard room, they just missed out a cupboard and put a small sink and fridge in there. When we arrived they asked for a credit card. I only have one and it was near it's limit, but that didn't matter because I had plenty of money on my debit card. As we obtained any expenses throughout the week instead of waiting until we check out and then settling our bill they just constantly attempted to charge my credit card without telling me so many times the card provider assumed fraud and closed my card. when I asked the desk manager, Castillo, if it was usual practise to hammer someones card without discussion before check out time and he didn't have an answer. Of course I paid all bills before I left, in fact earlier than that to stop them from trying to bill my card.They also accused my friend who I was staying with of smoking in the room. I don't smoke and hate the smell, and I didn't see him smoking in the room - I wouldn't have let him of course. And I can tell you 100% the room didn't smell of smoke, but he still may have done. Instead of so much as discussing it with me, the person who booked the room and gave the card details, they called up the room number and told us if someone didn't come down and pay 250 dollars as some kind of shake down money then they'd call the police and have us escorted out of the hotel. We had one night left and to be honest it would have been cheaper to just leave and stay elsewhere. But I'm not the type of person to be humiliated like that, so I paid it. I asked what the money would be used for and they said cleaning the drapes. There must be some expensive drape cleaners in NYC. Horrendous handling of what could have been a straightforward situation. The cleaners routinely rifled through all of our possessions to the point where I set a couple of obvious traps which they fell for. I realised they had gone through my bag after the first day so put privacy on the room so they wouldn't come in again. But they came in everyday regardless. They also took some dollars off the side table they must have assumed was a tip, but certainly wasn't. I've stayed a lot of places, even in US alone and this has to have been the worst experience I have ever had.

First of location is pretty good as it is only about one two blocks from Penn Station (so easy commute from JFK) and is about 5 blocks south of Times Square. Stayed on the top floor in a regular studio. Rooms are small but this is typical in NYC. Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, modern and spacious. A few things to keep in mind: if you are on the top floors the wait for the elevator is long, especially in the morning rush for breakfast. So unless you are particular to a top floor, I would stay on the lower floors so that you can take the stairs. Breakfast was nothing really special. I was expecting something similar to what you find at Hampton Inns but the selection was limited and not that good. Plus it gets very crowded in the dinning area so chances are, you wont be able to sit to eat. Didnt really interact with the staff so I comment on that.

Safes in the room, lots of channels, radio, iron hairdryer. They've thought of everything. Lots of electric/phone plugs everywhere.The kitchenette is wonderful, the bathroom is beautiful. Your view may leave something to be desired, but it's in the heart of the garment district, so, that' s to be expected. My NYC local friend says they've left alot of the old garment district as is, and so while it's a little dowdy, it's also a glimpse into old NY before Disney and trump wallpapered over it. Incredible restaurants just 15 minute walk up from here to west 46th. So you can end your day here without a huge hassle to get home. Close to theater and times square. The breakfast was good, not great, but respectable. Solid hot foods but no pastry. The service was fabulous. Beds divine. Great towels, lots of pillows. Very sumptuous and modern and sleek all at the same time. They do stainless steel and glass and make it sexy instead of austere.Lots of handy restaurants/cafes/convenience stores just around the corner. Everything is closeby. Nice, safe neighborhood. Always awake, always people around. You get the ""city that never sleeps"" experience without the trampling of times square. It's an easy walk to times square or Madison square garden.Parking is a bear. Welcome to NYC. The hotel doesn't have a garage. Expect to pay $47/24h at any of the private garages within a block of the hotel. No getting around it.

Well, Homewood Suites didn't seem to care.So I had some mixed feeling beforehand. Then we finally arrived after an 16 hrs travel. The woman at the desk told me, that there is a problem with my credit card and they CANCELED our reservation. I was shocked. We were told to return tomorrow with a valid credit card and sort of kicked out of the hotel.Fortunately there is the Marriot Courtyard hotel right across the street and we went there. I was quite exhausted and my daughter didn't feel very good, too. So the guy at the desk there was very nice and helped me to sort out the problem with our credit card and gave us a nice room. I am still so thankful for that.So the next morning I went back to the Homewood and they let me finally check in.The rooms are really nice and clean, except of the floor.

You are 100/300 yards from all the 34th street subway stations, and you can be at Macys in 5 minutes Because the hotel is in a quiet cross street there is little noise at night2) The free food and drink (5pm to 7pm) can be tasty and convenient when you are just off the plane. The free breakfast good when it's bacon and scrambled egg3) Everything is new and the bed is great. The elevators well programmed, so you don't wait much. The bathroom sparkles and, although small, you can shower (no bath) without soaking the place4) There are few hotel bargains in New York and we paid $340 in high season, which is possibly below average The staff are good, but that's the norm in New YorkThe less good1) The location is in the heart of the old garment district. There's not much garment stuff left, but the area has not changed much and you won't find many bars or eateries indeed anything at all of interest if you want to walk around2) The free breakfast can be dreadful when it is fried egg with the consistency of leather and sausage of doubtful flavour. The eating area has the charm of a works canteen, and you will eat with plastic cutlery and paper plates at breakfast 3) The bedroom is equipped with a new kitchen battery (fridge-freezer/microwave/dishwasher etc) As the room is not huge this takes up a lot of space and if you want to cook you will be less than 3 feet from the bed whilst doing so. And you can't eat a meal face to face, but would have to squash in side by side at a tiny table. Does anyone actually want to do this? And how would you keep the room smelling fresh if you did cook?4) Price/value ratios are a personal judgement. We came here after 3 stays at the Novotel and a bad experience the last time there. I think next time we shall opt for somewhere that costs more but gives us a larger room",London,"beenaroundLondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",64,3.0

It was 4.30 before the room was ready. Only a little thing but we had been travelling for 12 hours and instead of relaxing to go out we all had to rush.

We chose this hotel after major research online and based on reviews, photos , and location it seemed perfect. It also provides an extra bed which was crucial for us as our son who studies in NYC came to stay one night. Yes, the hotel is brand new, location is perfect, and rooms are much bigger than average. We asked for a higher floor , got it, and paid extra for a view(the hotel does not have the Empire view like other hotels in the area) that came in a form of huge floor to ceiling windows; lobby is beautiful and cozy and the upper roof deck is a plus (bring your own drinks), so far so good ,yet here comes the BUT.. We had major cleaning issues , our room was not thoroughly clean when we arrived and was cleaned less as days went by. Like many other modern trendy hotels now , the use of shiny materials and kitchens requires more work, and dust, food leftovers, hand prints and so forth are impossible to hide. A complaint to the staff did not help. We were lucky to have our bed changed, all we got was more and more towels, which we didn't use. We noticed same trend in the public areas. 5 days and elevators were not cleaned even once. I believe the fact that everything is brand new covers for the lack of maintenance. I also know that some people have different standards for those matters , yet since the price per night was not cheap, on the contrary , you expect more. Breakfast was crowded with people literally pushing to get food. It was sufficient but some items were out for the whole time we stayed; half and half for the (lobby )coffee (that was so bad), sausages.... after 3 days we decided to eat outside. NY has many great breakfast places . Our check in stuff was pleasant and accommodating , even though our room was not ready she made sure we got the room we want. On the other hand the check out guy very early in the morning was laughing in our face when asked a simple question, rude on any level. The week we stayed the hotel was packed with European groups and that meant more smoking! Yes, the hotel is smoke free but they would smoke outside and then go inside, elevators were stinky at times. During breakfast they would yell to each other, sit in large groups for longer period of time,( I get that , they are groups) but it wasn't the atmosphere my husband and I were looking forward to.All in all the experience was good taking into consideration it is a beautiful new hotel in a very good location with larger than usual rooms.

I had always wanted to visit New York City and was thrilled when my Mom suggested we go there for my 50th Birthday!! I spent at least a month researching all our options for Hotels, and chose the Homewood Suites by Hilton New York Midtown Manhattan Times Square. I have to say that it was THE best decision that I've ever made and this beautiful property was THE best hotel stay that I've ever had! We booked (3) nights from October 14th - 17th - which was just last week. We returned home late Friday night and miss it SO much! We're already talking about our return trip! I don't even know where to begin!!! The rooms were SO homey with our Full Kitchen...which not only included a Fridge, Microwave, Stove Top elements and Sink, but we were also provided with cutlery, plates, cooking utensils, cups, glasses and storage containers. This hotel even provided dish detergent packets for our built-in Dishwasher!!! It was wonderful being able to bring ""Doggy-bags"" home from a restaurant, storing them in the fridge, and heating them up the next day for Lunch!!! The hotel room was very quaint and we were fortunate enough to receive a room on the 16th floor facing the rear of the hotel. Some people may not have been happy looking into some else's apartment across the way...but it didn't bother us in the least! The room was SO private (once you lowered the blind) and quiet for sleeping. My Mom and Sister slept on the King bed and I slept on the Pull-out Bed. It was surprisingly comfortable and, with the fleece blanket, I felt like I was sleeping on my own bed! A great night's rest every night!!! The bathroom was lovely and everything was SO new and fresh! The hotel itself was exquisite...from the Waterfall wall and Fireplace in the Lobby, to the Rooftop Terrace with it's terrific views, décor and easy listening music pumping in! It was THE perfect retreat after a busy day of sightseeing! The complimentary FULL breakfast every morning was SO appreciated! You didn't have to search the area to find a great place to eat...it's was just a short elevator ride away! The selection was endless...from Scrambled Eggs and Ham, to cold Cereal, Juices, and Yogurt, to any kind of bread or bagel you desired! SO much to chose from! Monday to Thursday, they offered a complimentary dinner with Wine and Beer, if you desired. We took advantage of it our first night, and thoroughly enjoyed the Meat Lasagna, Garlic Toast and Green Beans...Delish!!!! On top of all of this, they also offered FREE Coffee, Tea and Hot Chocolate 24-7! This property has a central location perfect for whatever you chose to do be it shopping, sightseeing, taking in a show, travelling Uptown or Downtown, or just heading out for a great meal. What more could you ask for?! I've saved THE best for last...THE greatest staff ever! From our check-in and check-out with Allison, to chatting at breakfast with Devon or making car arrangements with Daniel, they epitomize what ""Exceptional Customer Service"" is all about! I too, work in Customer Service, and was SO impressed with how helpful, friendly, outgoing and warm each and every one of their staff members was! For that reason alone, they now have ""Customers for Life"". My love to each and every one of them, and I can't wait to come back again next year!!!!!",,Kelly B,6,5.0

Value...NYC is an expensive locale to begin with, so deciding amongst a huge assortment of standard hotel rooms, this appeals due to the massive size of the rooms! A full kitchen, including fridge, stove, microwave and dishwasher, ample space to accommodate lots of luggage, and all of the fabulous NYC shopping, a seating area, in addition to spacious & welcoming beds...I would never consider staying at another hotel in the city again...Homewood Suites By Hilton carries the standard that the Hilton name represents, as well as the superior customer service one expects from the Hilton name. The additional perks are also not typical of other hotels in the city...Monday through Thursday there is a complimentary dinner offered in their main floor facility, and complimentary wine is included. How fantastic and unexpected from a NYC hotel! The location is on a quieter corner of the excitement and 24 hour madness of Times Square...but in your room, it is just peace and quiet...all the right ingredients for a perfect night's sleep. Easy to walk to all the main tourist attractions including Macy's, Madison Square Gardens and the Empire State Building, to name a few. All staff members were amenable, professional, courteous, and available to help with anything...they understand that the human touch they offer is a key part of excellence in customer service.

First, the hotel itself is only about six months old, so not only is everything pristine, the accommodations and furnishings are current and trendy. The king size bed was comfortable with high thread-count sheets. The small sofa actually does pull out into a twin bed that isn't bad. A full walk-in shower with glass doors, stylish tile and glass tile inlay was so much better than the usual tub/shower combo. Having a full kitchen with refrigerator and dishwasher was great for bringing home leftovers and keeping treats from nearby delis. Although, food was certainly never an issue as they fed us well. The hot breakfast every day was available from 6 am until 10:30 am, which is so convenient regardless of what time you need to be up for the day. Breakfast was so-so, about average for hotels, and always included eggs, varying types of potatoes and breakfast meat. There were also plenty of breads, cereals and juices. The manager's reception Monday - Thursday was from 5 pm - 7 pm and not only included unlimited beer and wine, but also a full dinner. I was skeptical when I read other reviews, but our first night we arrived to parmesan-encrusted tilapia, red potatoes and fresh, french green beans. It wasn't exquisite, but it was tasty and better than some restaurants. The dining area is adequate and there is a large, nicely enclosed atrium off the dining area and lobby if the weather is pleasant.There is no swimming pool, but there is a nice fitness facility and laundry room in the basement. There is also a safe in the room. They made the most of the small room with enough drawer, storage and closet space. A small rolling table that unfolds to a larger table along with the rolling table that pulls out from under the desk were genius use of space. A full-sized iron and ironing board as well as a hair dryer are in the rooms. There are three elevators and sometimes there was a wait, especially towards the end of breakfast. The staff members were always pleasant and helpful. The only hiccup was when we found the housekeeper had unplugged my phone from my charger and plugged in her own. She accidentally left it plugged in when she finished cleaning the room, so we found it upon our return. We tracked her down to return the phone and she was terribly embarrassed. The convenient location was superb! Although technically in the Garment District, we were five short blocks to Penn Station, a couple of blocks from Times Square, and just a few minutes walk to the Theatre district. Central Park is a bit of a hike, but we walked it when the weather was nice. We walked to Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue, Carnegie Hall, Madison Avenue and MoMA. 37th street is a main thoroughfare from Brooklyn all the way across Manhattan to the Holland Tunnel, so we were able to catch cabs easily when needed - either on 37th itself or the half block away on 8th. Our taxi from LaGuardia to the hotel was $40 but we ordered an uber to return to LaGuardia, which was $55, so it would be there when we were ready and we wouldn't have to catch a cab with luggage.We're so glad we found the perfect place for our family of three to spend a week in Manhattan!","Spring Hill, Tennessee","Diana K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spring Hill, Tennessee</strong>",5,5.0

The first night we stayed neither of us could get any sleep at all due to the demolition work happening across the street throughout the entire night. Our Suite (along with all suites in the hotel) was located on the 2nd Floor and was facing the street. Even with the double-glazing and earplugs, we could not sleep as the demolition involved jack-hammering and the contractors throwing huge chunks of concrete from upper floors to the enormous metal skip bin on the street.Next morning when we requested to be moved to a quitter room in the hotel, the reception staff advised that we should have been aware that all building work should stop by 11pm. Being from Australia, we are not familiar with NYC building regulations.We were moved to the 21st floor and although a smaller Studio Room, it was much quieter and we enjoyed the rest of our stay. The beds were very comfortable, as were the pillows.The breakfast buffet was included and we did eat there a few mornings. It was best to go early, as it was chaotic and crowded after 8.30am -10am. Unfortunately, not much in the way of fresh fruit on offer. Mainly bagels, toast, scrambled egg, bacon and yogurt. There were bananas and apples most mornings. The fruit juice was really good.

Most were quite good, but this one was disappointing. I stayed here for 9 nights in September, but cannot say that I enjoyed it. It was barely functional, not worth the high cost ($550 a night). First the good points: It is located within a few blocks from Times Square, Madison Square Gardens, the Garment District and Macy's. But it is not convenient if you have business meeting in midtown on the East Side. It is newly constructed, although I cannot vouch for the construction quality.And then there are quite a few negatives: 1. It is located on a busy side street with a lot of construction, making the street noisy and dangerous at times. The noise in the backyard of the hotel, where they have placed a couple of nice tables, was deafening.2. The hotel is a new construction, but does not seem to be of the best quality. The walls, doors and windows are not soundproof: You could hear babies crying and couples arguing in neighboring rooms.3. Rooms are quite small, judging by the 1-Bedroom suite I stayed in.4. The only restaurant is claustrophobic -- way too small for a 22-story building.5. Breakfast was OK - what you would expect from a budget hotel.6. There is no view of any kind. The hotel is in the middle of Manhattan with nothing to look at from any direction.However, the worst part is the service. Housekeeping is kept to a minimum and front desk service is certainly sub-standard. Take this example: As a regular Hilton customer, I always ask for a high floor to avoid noise, especially in big cities like New York. To be sure, I asked for a high floor when I booked the room directly on Hilton's website, weeks before the start of my stay, then followed up with an email a few days later. When I checked in, I was surprised to find out that they my room was on the 2nd floor, with no possibility of moving to a higher a floor any time during my 9-night stay. Forget about upgrades that Hilton Honors customers are entitled to. Simple decency would have required the hotel to contact me in advance to tell me that they could not provide a room on a high floor, so I could find accommodation elsewhere. This was the first time, perhaps, were Hilton has failed me on this simple request.I could go on, but this is probably enough.

There is a grocery store on 42nd and 9th that I load up with groceries and have food and drink for the time I am in town. Kitchenette has stove,fridge, microwave and all the utensils you need. In addition they serve free breakfast every morning, most is pretty good. They also offer free dinner mon-thurs. It's not gourmet but something mom would make for you. Lastly, they offer free beer and wine during dinner 5-7. It's just nice to come back from the day and enjoy a drink on the roof deck or in back patio. Bed is very comfortable and room well laid out.

Loads of eating places around and hundreds of taxis passing through every minute. Room: A very clean, comfortable space with many conveniences. Though the room is somewhat petite, they managed to provide many useful features. The kitchenette offers two stovetop burners, a large microwave, full sized fridge, plates, bowls, drinking glasses, cutlery, toaster etc. I honestly can never understand how extended stay hotels with these features are cheaper than the more ""high end"" places which won't even provide a simple cutlery set. The only thing that was petite was the bathroom. It was however still comfortable; just no wasted space. Hotel Staff: The front desk staff members were very polite and helpful. As it was our first trip to New York, we were overwhelmed by the scale of things but the front desk patiently answered our questions thoroughly. They also offered useful advise with respect to tours and transport. Breakfast: The hotel provides a complimentary continental breakfast buffet. No complaints what-so-ever. It's a decent spread with a fair number of options. Summary: This hotel has no fancy chandeliers or antique furniture or a breathtaking lobby. It does however have free high speed wifi, complimentary breakfast, and a room with an awesomely comfortable king sized bed and features you would find quite useful when travelling.

I really wanted to stay in Manhattan, but most of the private rooms were so expensive; I found a room down in the financial district under $200, and that's about it. This room was listed for $289 online, but I bid through Priceline and got it for $140/night. It was a great deal at that price, because it was a decent-sized room with a very comfortable king-sized bed. We had a fridge and oven, too. We didn't use the oven, but the fridge was very convenient for water & other drinks so that we could take them with us daily. The free breakfast was also convenient, although the food was just ""ok"". Yes, the breakfast area was crowded, but not that bad. We didn't have any problems with elevators, as other reviewers mentioned. Free wifi and a business office.I was very impressed with how NICE the staff was. Very helpful with dinner suggestions, directions, and setting up a ride back to the airport. Everyone always greeted us warmly, and we were given a small bag of snacks at check-in. We were celebrating our anniversary, and they also left a bottle on wine in our room. Do yourself a favor, and use a private car to/from hotel. We used a taxi on the way there; $50 to hotel, it was hot, and he drove like a maniac! On the way back, we paid $55 for the private car, but it was cool, comfortable, and the driver very friendly & safe. (There IS no cheap way to get to hotel, unless you plan to ride the subway and walk several blocks with luggage!)The hotel is a couple of blocks to Times Square, and a couple of blocks in another direction to Penn Station. Keep in mind, though, that NYC blocks can be LONG. At the end of long days, I definitely wished it was right in Times Square. Also, many midtown areas that are NOT tourist areas are dirty & a bit seedy, and the area around the hotel is no exception. Overall, though, I was pleased with the hotel, especially for the price we paid.","Cincinnati, Ohio","alisonsk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>",23,4.0

I will remember for my next trip to the city.It had a nice pull out love seat that was perfect for my 17 year old. Oh yeah, free breakfast!

The hotel is newer and stills holds its newer quality throughout. We chose to stay in the largest suite, at 485 sq. ft. There are only 5 in the whole building and all of them are on the 2nd floor. The whole 1st floor are public areas. We were disappointed to find out that though you pay more for a larger suite, it is right above street level - very noisy. We are aware of noise in NYC, this is not are first trip to the area. We were not aware of the location of the suite. In my opinion, all the higher priced suites should have been put higher up. Because at almost all hotels in Manhattan, except those around Central Park,your room will face another building and that's to be expected.The suite itself was roomy, for New York standards. There is a shade that is used in front of the window and is raised or lowered using a chain. It did not work correctly all of the time, thus making you raise and lower it a few times to get it up. The water pressure was dismal in the shower. Being on the 2nd floor, you would expect better water pressure.Breakfast is always offered at Homewood Suites. This place offered a normal breakfast fare, without any waffles. If you arrive after 8:30 am, expect a large crowd and minimal seating availability.The staff were very helpful - that is probably the best part of the stay. Eager to be of assistance in all areas. The location offers an opportunity to walk in any direction to eat, drink or take in a sight. If you choose not to walk, taxi's are everywhere - it is NYC!This site has a work out room with modern equipment, an outside patio, a lounge area and a small seating area in the lobby by a fireplace. Overall we were happy with the location and staff but hold reserve for the upgraded suite location and usability. We give it this rating because the suite was lacking, which was not so good because its a newer establishment. We will try another hotel next time we come to NYC.","St. Pete Beach, Florida","sea4metoo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Pete Beach, Florida</strong>",70,3.0

Chose Homewood Suites this time because of its proximity to Penn Station. It is very nice & new. However, even though the word 'suite' is in the title of the property- these are single rooms with all of the amenities of a suite literally squeezed into a relatively small space. There is no separation between the main bed and the kichenette area and the sofa bed is right next to the main bed on the other side- so really, no privacy for anyone. Some creative rearranging of furniture is necessary to pull out the sofa bed and if someone opens the fridge in the middle of the night- well, the entire room lights up. The bathroom is tight as well- and I agree with some of the previous posts that a few more shelves for storing personal items would be useful- especially considering these rooms are meant to accommodate 3 people. I found the breakfast to be unremarkable- typical mass produced runny eggs etc. I imagine this would be a fine option for couples or small families (one child). The full size fridge and cooktop, along with cabinets fully stocked w/plates, pots, utensils & glassware would definitely allow for saving $$ on meals during an extended stay. The front desk staff was very friendly and I imagine they are very helpful to tourists who need guidance. The property served it's purpose for us for one night, but we probably would not choose it again.","Silver Spring, MD","nycgurl59</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, MD</strong>",22,4.0

On a last minute trip, we booked a room at the Homewood Suites and were blown away. Before arriving, I was expecting a mid-level hotel, but we were so pleasantly surprised that this will become a top choice in the future.First, a huge thank you to Leslie at the front desk. She was amazing. At check in, she was so professional and warm. She genuinely wanted to make it a best stay possible and she succeeded. She found a wonderful room for us and when she heard that we were celebrating our anniversary, she sent up some yummy goodies - thank you. Then, when we asked for a late check-out, she went out of her way to make it happen. Her level of excellent service was 5 star and better than some of the way more expensive hotels that we visit.As for the hotel - it is very nice and new. The layout is modern and sleek. The bedding is very nice and the kitchenette is a wonderful feature (having a full refrigerator, microwave, extra sink and range makes a big difference for both business and family travel). The bathroom is also very good. Couple of suggestions here is that there could be extra shelf space for toiletries and the shower needs some type of slip proofing - when wet it is very slippery. But the decor and amenities are very nicely done and supplied. Added bonuses include free wi-fi, coffee/tea in lobby 24 hours and a very nice breakfast each morning. Not just the usual continental, but eggs, sausage, potatoes, oatmeal, fruit, etc. For NYC, it is not usual to have this type of buffet included in the price. And, we saw that every Mon-Thur, they offer free dinner and drinks. Again, incredible value for price paid.The location is very good for those who may be traveling in/out of Penn Station or visiting Madison Square Garden/shopping at Herald Square. It is also not a far walk for Times Square - another top tourist destination. In summary, this hotel is new and well done. Although not as expensive as a much higher rated property, it offers the service and amenities above and beyond its competitors. Definitely add it to your list of great NYC finds.","fairfield county, ct","funtootravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>fairfield county, ct</strong>",117,5.0

Great view of the Empire State from the rear of upstairs terrace.

So you have to view everything through that lens.It took a little longer than expected to get through the check in line. When we did (at about 2:00 pm), the room wasn't ready. As a Hilton Honors member, they had allowed me to check in and pick a particular room. I said it wasn't necessary to get that particular room, but they didn't have any unoccupied rooms ready yet.So we went out for a walk. At 3:30 pm, the room still wasn't ready. So the girlfriend camped out at the front desk and the room was ready in 20 minutes.While the room appeared small, it was immaculate and more than big enough for the task. The bad was comfortable. The kitchenette seemed to have everything (although I only used the refrigerator to hold a doggie bag). If you were going to feed a full family, it would be a little cramped (although I don't have a full family, so what do I know).

The hotel was clean, quiet, and excellent value for money. All the staff that we encountered were very friendly and happy to help. We booked a 'King Efficiency with City View', I had assumed that 'efficiency' would mean small, but our room was spacious and very comfortable. We had all the amenities you'd expect plus a small kitchenette area that came in very handy and included a microwave, fridge freezer, toaster and dishwasher. Perfect for making those midnight snack bagels after a night out. The room price also included breakfast, which was the usual buffet style mixture of cooked breakfast, pastries, cereals, fruit and yogurt that you find in most hotels. Surprisingly the hotel also offers guests a free dinner Monday to Thursday (the menu is posted in the room) and free tea/coffee in the lobby whenever you want. Compared to other hotels we researched this one certainly gives you excellent value without compromising on quality.The location is excellent - right on the edge of the garment district, it's just a 5 min walk from Penn Station which is a main hub station for travel to NYC's airports. It's about a 10min walk from both Times Square, Macy's, and the Empire State Building (there are also subway stops at all of these points, so it's easy to hop onto the MTA to go further afield too). A personal highlight for me was that the hotel was only a 2min walk from Mood Fabrics, the fabric superstore that is featured in the TV show Project Runway. If you're a sewist then a trip to Mood is a must! We were on the 21st floor (of 22), so street noise was minimal. Really all we heard were the omnipresent sirens of emergency vehicles. We never heard our neighbours, so either the walls are pretty thick or we had quiet floor-mates. The only noise we experienced was from the fridge, and the air-con, both of which were pretty noisy and couldn't be switched off. That said, the noise didn't bother us enough to keep us awake (which might have had something to do with the endurance sightseeing we were doing every day).All in all I'd be happy to recommend the Homewood Suites to family and friends, and I'd certainly book there again if I'm every lucky enough to get to return to NYC.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Heather_Dalgarno</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",17,4.0

Subway is about 4 mins away, Macy's within 8-10 walk, Times Square is about 10 mins too. ** Breakfast is served daily and just think of it as a bonus as I read so many comments about it - just think how much money you save each morning. it is true that it's crowded but it's worth the wait if you need to (we never had to wait to find a table and we had breakfast at 8am-9am.** Dinner is also served (Mon-Thu) which is another bonus. Menu can be found on the room fridge and we found it very helping to check what's on the menu everyday in case there is an option we don't like. ** There is a nice and modern Gym/Fitness center on the lower floor. on the same floor there is a business room equipped with 2 computers and a printer - so handy and used it a couple of times during the stay.Wi-fi is free and works really fast - which was a big plus to us.** Front desk reception - We received a nice and welcoming service by Nafeesa who helped us several times during our stay. ** Elevators - we had the same experience of long waiting as other guests had but have to say that this won't put us off staying here again in the future.

We usually stay at a comparable hotel a few blocks away and have been very happy there so we were wary of trying someplace new. The reason we chose this hotel over the other one was because the rates were better and it was brand new.The location of this hotel was perfect for us as we were going to be using Penn Station to get to and from JFK and the US Open and it was a short walk away. We also found a great little eatery that offered 2 slices of pizza and a soda for $2.75, and while there are many of those places in the city we liked this one because the pizza was perfect for me and my mom was able to get rice and beans so dinner came out to less than $8.00!We arrived at the hotel around 8:30am so it was too early to check into our rooms, but the nice lady at the desk offered to store our bags which we took advantage of. We returned to the hotel around 3:45pm and Thomas assisted us with getting our room. There was a slight mix up with our assigned room but Thomas took care of it quickly which we appreciated.We had a room with 2 queen beds and the size was great for us, especially compared to other rooms we've stayed at in NYC. We went to the complimentary dinner downstairs and I decided not to have anything; my mom did have some but she didn't really care for it. Breakfast the first morning wasn't great as my pancakes were a little cold and hard, but breakfast the second day was much better when I had the scrambled eggs and French toast. We went to breakfast early the first day since we were heading to a day session at the US Open so the seating area wasn't too crowded and we were able to get elevators relatively quickly. However, on the second morning (the day we checked out) we went to breakfast later and it was very hectic and we ended up taking the stairs to and from breakfast since the elevator still hadn't come after 10 minutes. The seating/elevator issues are a problem at the other hotel at which we stay so this problem definitely isn't exclusive to the Homewood Suites, but it's worth mentioning so people can be aware of it and perhaps time their breakfasts appropriately.Checkout was a breeze and again it was a short walk to Penn Station, and the walk is definitely manageable with luggage as we each had a carry-on suitcase.Instead of automatically booking our other hotel when we go to NYC, we are now going to check availability at the Homewood too. Be sure to check out the rooftop terrace on the 22nd floor.

I stayed with my two daughters (15 and 20), my eldest daughter slept on the futon bed and found it comfortable, and although the room wasn't huge (typically for NY) it was large enough to keep the sofa bed made up in the day, so we didn't have to put it away each morning.When I booked the hotel there were no reviews and I didn't realise that it hadn't opened at that point. Not sure I would have taken that gamble had I know that in advance, however all aspects of the room were perfect and a lot of the equipment had not been used (pots and pans etc)The bathroom was lovely and the shower was great. My daughters loved all the daily complimentary toiletries (Neutrogena) and I loved the big white fluffy towels.We had a king/queen sized bed (not sure which) it was so comfy!The girls loved the fact that it was free wifi so they could log on to all the usual social media sites as soon as we were back in the hotel!We were on the 12th floor and had a street view, in the mornings it was lovely and sunny. The room was very quiet with no noise from other rooms. In fact we were directly outside one of the lifts, but didn't experience any noise from it. I read other reviews whereby guests were unhappy about the wait time for the lift, but there were 3 lifts so we never had to wait very long at all.We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and found that if we went down to breakfast a bit before 9am it was generally less busy, however even we it was busy we still managed to select any of the plentiful options (hot choices/toast/bagels/cereal/fruit etc) There was one member of staff who couldn't do enough for us at breakfast (i'm sorry I cant remember his name) but he made us feel so welcome and made us smile every time he was working.There is a complimentary self service coffee bar open 24/7 and we liked having a hot chocolate to take up to our room when we got in late in the evening.We didn't eat dinner at the hotel (although this is included in the price of the stay), this was due to a busy schedule and we weren't usually at the hotel at that time.The front of house staff always greeted us with ""welcome home"" when we came back through the door which was a nice touch.On our checkout day we left our luggage for a few hours as we had an evening flight, again the front desk staff facilitated this for us. On our last visit to NYC we stayed in a more expensive, well known, traditional hotel which was nice enough but overpriced and a bit dated. When we return we will definitely stay at Homewood Suites again!Thank you to all the staff and we hope to see you all again very soon.room 1205 (20.08.14 - 27.08.14)","London, United Kingdom","Scarlett932014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

Hotel has been open since 30 June 2014, so obviously in excellent condition. However the cleanliness is not up to the mark. When we checked in one of the rooms was not clean and had dead ants and other insects. Bought this to the attention of front desk and they changed the room immediately. However we now had the rooms on separate floors, although we had specifically requested adjoining rooms because of our teenage children. Another round of discussion with the front desk and they finally managed to get us 2 rooms on the same floor. They also deducted one nights charge for one room. Again after 2 days there was lint and dust all over the floor, which was from housekeeping not doing their job correctly. When highlighted to the GM, he was very apologetic and had it corrected by the time we came back in the evening alongwith complimentary cookies and bathroom accessories. The elevators are messed up and we ended up taking the stairs down most mornings. Apparently its some sort of new technology in which the elevator decides when to skip floors when its full.Breakfast was included in our rate however most days when we came down, it was a madhouse and we ended up getting breakfast outside.They had a group of 50+ teenagers on a school trip and on one evening the lobby was more like a school playground.The walls of the rooms were so thin that you can hear pretty much everything your neighbour says and you can hear him/her opening the curtains.On the positive side, excellent location. Walking distance to Times Square, Penn Station etc. Excellent kitchenette, with dishwasher in the room. Fridge was a bit noisy though.Good quality (Neutrogena) toiletries.On checkout as we had 5 bags we asked for a suv yellow cab to go to JFK as we knew it has fixed price of USD 52 + tolls of USD 12 = 64. However reception got us a private limo and said it would cost us the same. When we reached JFK the driver said the price was USD 85 because its a private limo.

I did get my bed made each day, but rarely got coffee, shampoo, ice bags, etc. I have a feeling they were in and out of the room within 30 mins based on some of my departure and arrival times. I had to make a call each day to get product delivered to my room. Some days I even left an obvious note asking for specific supplies, but those were ignored as well.","Saint Peters, Missouri","jfleig01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Peters, Missouri</strong>",2,3.0

We had a lot of bad experiences here, but I will not list all of them, since I could pretty much write a book on it.Location: location is great! Not far from most of the main midtown attractions and subway. If you are on any kind of meal budget and looking for something cheap, there are several pizza places within 3 blocks that offer a special of 2 slices of pizza & a can soda for just $2.25. Pizza was good and it's a terrific deal!Check-in: this is what started everything off really badly!! We booked a city view room, months and months ago and that is what we expected to get when we arrived. We were informed that the city view room was not available & also advised by the clerk that their lovely corporate office allows overbooking on their website for this room and they could not help it (his words, not mine). We ended up getting a regular room, but were still charged for a city view room. Last time I checked, city view rooms were more, which means we should have been charged less, but we weren't. We just loved paying that price for a 6th floor room with a fabulous view of the old building in front of us that looked like it would fall down if you blew on it! Completely ticked off already. I will say that the 2 clerks checking us in were very friendly, but it didn't help my mood any after this.Room: the room was very clean and modern. However, if you need to use the pullout bed in the sofa, you have to wait before bedtime, because there is NO ROOM to walk once this is pulled out. Even my teen daughter couldn't walk through there and she is small!! The bathroom was also very clean and modern, but we had absolutely no sink or counter room to place any of our things. We had to keep everything in our bags, which was a pain in the whazoo! You have a full-size fridge, microwave and a small sink in the kitchen area, which is nice to have. The regular bed was very comfortable.Breakfast: one word----CRAZY!!! They had a good selection, but I sure do wish hotels would have healthier options for breakfast. Not everyone eats pork bacon/sausage, so turkey bacon/sausage would be a nice option. The crazy part was trying to find a place to sit. For a hotel this size, the sitting area for breakfast is tiny and a complete madhouse in the mornings. There is no line for breakfast, so everyone is just stepping in wherever they can to grab the food. Terrible way to start the day.Checkout: this was more painful than checking in. On their website, it states $40 a day to park in the deck across the street. First, it is only $40 a day if you have a car. If you have an SUV or truck, it's $45 a day. That adds up when you are there several days. Nowhere on their website does it say anything about $45 for SUV's and trucks!! I am livid over that and they should have all prices posted!! We wanted to pack our SUV, check out of the hotel, but leave our SUV in the deck so we could go to the 9/11 Museum. After that, we were leaving NYC. I asked the hotel clerk if we can do this and she advised yes and that we have 1 in/out privilege, so that should be no problem. (We did not use this yet, nor did we know we had 1 in/out privilege until now.) Hubby went to get our SUV so we could pull it up to the front of the hotel to load, but then take right back into the deck and park for a few more hours. The attendant in the deck said he could do this, but he needed my husband to pay him $90 cash to take it out of the deck to make sure we were taking it back and then he would give us the cash back when we return to leave and then pay with the credit card. WTH???? My husband said he was not handing over $90 cash, with no proof he did so and no guarantee we would get it back. My husband also offered to pay the full amount with our credit card right then, but the attendant would not allow him to pay. Something is completely off about that! So, after 45 minutes of this hassle and me asking the hotel clerks why their website says $40 a day to park, but we are being charged $45 a day, the attendant said the only thing we could do is bring all of our stuff over to the deck and load it, then he would park the vehicle back in a parking space. Oh, did I mention it was pouring down rain????!!!!!!! So, I'm trying to push the luggage cart outside, hubby comes running over to help me, then a hotel bellhop comes over and takes the cart from my husband and rams it down off the curb onto the street and guess what?? A ton of bags and our pillows fell off the cart into a huge water puddle on the street. Well, at this point, I just lost it and cried for the next 30 minutes. The hotel clerks inside did not care one bit about any of this. We've stayed in NYC many times, but have never encountered a hotel experience like this one. The other hotels we've stayed in always added the parking to our room--we've never had to pay this separately, so that was a complete nightmare for us.So, due to all the stress we encountered at this Homewood, we will no longer be loyal to the Hilton brand. My hubby's company also has a corporate contract with the Hilton hotels, but we are filing a formal complaint with them, so hopefully, they will get new contracts with other brands to give us different options. Just not worth starting out a road trip with this kind of stress.",NC,"Jennifer M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NC</strong>",84,2.0

Convenient to Penn Station but a little off the beaten track. Stayed in room 1915 - a King Studio - with a convertible couch at the foot of the bed. Traveling with my adult daughter so we used both the bed and the convertible. When the couch is open, there is almost no floor space in the room. If you are sharing the bed this room is fine. If you need a second bed, you should get one of the rooms/suites with 2 beds. There is only a shower in the bathroom, and by most standards would be considered small. The breakfast is nice, but the layout of the buffet area creates traffic jams. Breakfast selection is very nice. A full house taxes the capacity of the seating area, and one morning we were told we could not sit in the back half of the breakfast room because it was reserved for a group (despite it remaining empty the entire time we were there). Staff was very pleasant, and hotel was clean and well appointed.

Overall the service was good with only a few minor issues. We arrive at 5 PM on a Saturday and were told our room was not ready yet. Another member of our group arrived at the same time and were told the same thing. We went to grab some food and an hour later our rooms were ready. The first thing we noticed was that for the size (and height..20+ floors) there are only 3 elevators and each could only hold 3 people with a wheeled suitcase. We were on the 4th floor, and by day 2 used the stairs exculsively. Every time we tried to catch an elevator they took forever and half the time were full when they did stop on our floor.The rooms look nice, but for an extended stay type room are not very well appointed. For a room that should sleep up to 5 there were 9 hangers and 3 drawers for clothing. Thats it, no more. My other complaint is that the room has 2 beds and a cold out bed, but all are in the same room. There is no privacy. Most extended stay hotels have a bed room and a separate living area with a fold out so there is some level of privacy. My wife also did not like that the bathroom door was a slide type door not an actual closing door. Same issue with no privacy.My next dissapointment was with breakfast. The food was OK, what you would expect for a hotel breakfast, but the seating is horribly lacking and the actual layout of the service area is not well thought out. The area is cramped with the hot food in the middle and the bread, juice, fruit etc on a separate bar wrapping around the center island. This layout doee not work well when half the people staying there are trying to get eggs and toast in the morning. Finding a seat after you get your breakfast is a crap shoot. The last morning we were there the whole seating issue was even worse as the staff had half the seating area blocked off for a ""group"". Honestly this area needs to be twice the size to accomodate the traffic. Maid service was good for the most part, my only complaint there is they did not refill our coffee half the time. But the room was cleaned, beds made and towles replaced. What dealings we did have with the staff they were plesent and helpful. Some of the people staying with our group has issues of some sort, but we were happy with the staff and really felt they were the only saving grace.The hotel is nice, the location is good, the people are the best part. The hotel itself needs work and was poorly thought out. If it were just my wife and I, then I might consider staying here again because we won't usually eat at the hotel and the storage would have been OK for 2 people, but as part of a group or with the kids, not a chance.","Lubbock, Texas","dmarkstravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lubbock, Texas</strong>",22,2.0

It was substituted by a tuna-casseroley thingy.->Breakfast: only slightly more decent than dinner, but such an overwhelming madhouse in the buffet area that your blood pressure will shoot through the roof as you try to snake your way through 20 people to get to the toaster->Seating/atmosphere: unless you're a fan of screaming children and people dumping bagels into their backpacks, you won't appreciate this feeding trough->Coffee: watery and burnt-tasting - congratulations on achieving that winning combo!->Elevators: too few and with a mind of their own->Gym: the website listed free weights, but there are none.

We didn't have a problem but I did notice there was continued construction going on in the property's lower floors so the elevators may be in use by contractors. That should take care of itself eventually when all construction gets done. Our room was small but highly efficient and had everything you could need. I think we may have been the first people to stay in that room.The staff (especially Daniel) were all helpful and engaged with you despite a lot going on.The location is convenient to Times Square and Penn Station but tucked far enough between 8th and 9th to be very quiet.

We stayed at this hotel for 14 nights in July, FANTASTIC experience! The only staff member who seemed a bit cold was the lady who checked us in; other than her, the bell men, wait staff at the dining area and the girl who checked us out at the end were all extremely helpful and friendly. Each night we walked back into the hotel, we were greeted with a ""Welcome home!"" which was really nice to hear. Housekeeping was done every day and we had new towels, bins cleaned, new supply of soaps etc. Fridge was full size and definitely not noisy as one reviewer claimed. No noise heard from the outside during the weekends either. Was great to be able to go upstairs to the rooftop and lounge about, or have breakfast up there as well as in the courtyard. Breakfast served daily and there was some decent food too (eggs, bacon, sausages, bagels, toast, pastries, cornflakes, fruit, yoghurt, decaf/ regular/ strong coffees, teas, juices).. Dinner Monday to Thursday with a different me u each night PLUS wines and beer. I mean, what more do you want?! I loved it! And for the price we paid ($200 a night), to get free breakfast and dinner at a brand new hotel is pretty good! Complainers: next time, go to a 2.5 star joint for the same price. This is New York City you are talking about.Drawbacks:- Perhaps the room could've been just a touch larger so there's more space between the kitchenette and bed, and the elevators could've been a bit bigger. Other than that, I found the hotel to be excellent. Location great too. Only a few blocks south of Times Square, three blocks north of Madison Sq Garden, Penn Station and Macy's.

Allow plenty of time for that and go early cos once they run out they are not really keen to replenish items and we were frequently told that we were out of luck!

This was a terrific start to the stay; we thought. We still have two more nights here as part of our 7 night vacation. I asked the bellman about city tours and he immediately pulled a brochure out if his jacket pocket. I told him tripadvisor gave it bad reviews and he looked irritated.

Our kids' room view was good, but our room looked directly into offices10. Grave shift staff were less than helpful (We took our kids to ""Escape the Room"" and arrived back about 1am on Monday morning. I walked my daughter and her friend to the hotel and watched them walk through the first door and turned around to go help my husband carry food from a vendor 1/2 block down. The girls intended to sit in the lobby if our hotel and wait. A few minutes later they came rushing into the restaurant and said the man turned them away, so they ran to where we were. Not realizing they needed a key to get through the second door, I was livid to learn, the hotel sent two girls,13 years old, back into the streets of NYC at 1am. When we entered the hotel, the same man who sent them away, held up a room key in a smug way and said you need a room key to enter. His rude demeanor enraged me and his flip attitude, blemished my entire experience at this hotel. My husband and I got the girls to their room and I returned and asked Charlie and John at the front desk for the man's name who sent these kids into the night. They claimed they did not know because he worked for an outside fire safety company. I would say they lied because the three me were involved in a friendly conversation before we entered the building. When I asked the man directly for his name, he cowardly covered it up and said he didn't have to give his name. Why would he hide his name if he had not done something wrong? I worked as a GM for a hotel, so I get people not letting non-guests into the facility after a certain time for safety, but no effort was made nor were the girls told they could wait inside the first doorway. Our kids are fairly naive and very innocent, they never would have questioned authority, so they left, SCARED! Perhaps, customer service training and common sense training are in order. Had your staff simply bothered to ask a simple question, these young girls would not have been sent into the streets! Even more appalling is the fact that your staff tried to justify their response by saying many times young kids try to come into the hotel and do bad things; how would they know, you've only been open a few weeks.)Until the incident with our kids, I was willing to overlook all the cons we had experienced because this is a new hotel.Now . . . I am just a disappointed, ex-Hilton patron!

Our bedroom was very nicely furnished and very clean. Spacious too for a New York hotel. The staff were mostly very friendly and helpful. The main reason I wouldn't stay here again is because it felt overcrowded. Only two of the three elevators were working for most of our stay, so we had to wait a long time for one to show up. It probably doesn't help that there are displays telling you that an elevator on the way down is passing your floor by. Even when the third elevator started working again, there were still long waits for them at peak times. By far the worst experience was the breakfast buffet. The layout of this space is horrible. It would work well if there were 5-6 people trying to get breakfast, but with tens of people thronging around a tiny space to get food it was unbearable. People shoving and pushing, no order to how to navigate the tiny space, people spilling food/drinks because people were pushing into them. It is a disaster. And the staff do their best to keep up, but it's impossible. Another terrible design decision was to have the door of the pantry open out directly into the space where people are trying to queue for cereal. Whoever designed this space did not think ahead to when people would actually be using it. There were plenty of table to sit and eat breakfast once you got through the crowds. Personally I would have preferred to see some of that space used for the buffet.So if you don't plan to be in this hotel during peak times, or don't plan to have the breakfast and don't mind taking the stairs/waiting for elevators, then this hotel is probably great for you.","Princeton, New Jersey","DancingQueenGermany</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Princeton, New Jersey</strong>",8,3.0

Being a newly-opened facility, it was very clean, sleek and up-to-date. The location is convenient, if not picturesque, but that's okay. With the windows closed, the rooms are SILENT. The staff was quite friendly and helpful - those that I met, that is. I was always greeted and sent off with a smile, and they seemed to be working very hard.The only glitch was that at the end of my first full day I returned to my room around 4 pm....and no housekeeping had been done. I checked to make sure I hadn't accidentally put out the ""leave me alone"" card - nope. When I was ready to go out again for the evening, I stopped by the desk and mentioned this, wondering if they just didn't do housekeeping for guests staying two nights?? My concern was immediately addressed and someone was sent up to take care of it. Judging from the other reviews so far, thoroughness of houskeeping is definitely a kink that needs to be worked out. But when they do, this will be a great choice, especially for families with a lot of mouths to feed if you stay during the days they have evening hospitality.","Birmingham, Alabama","AnnaFlannery</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",19,4.0

Overall, the stay has been comfortable and any of our issues that arised, Jatin Kumar and other front desk staff smoothed them out. I will definitely recommend this hotel, but be forewarned that they are fairly new and still working out all the kinks with their staff.","San Bernardino, California","charmi_shah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Bernardino, California</strong>",13,3.0

We recently completed a WONDERFUL stay at the Homewood Suites, 312 W 37th St in New York. We cannot brag enough about this hotel!! The hotel was spotless and clean and the staff was AMAZING!!! From the time we first registered until we left, we were treated like royalty! The staff was SUPER-- We were given excellent directions to the famous landmarks in NY, subway advice and information, superb service at the evening receptions and breakfasts, excellent customer service, and they even arranged for a car to take us back to the airport. Some of the staff members who went ABOVE and BEYOND was: RAJ who replaced the in-room safe that was defective, ALLAN at the front desk who greatly assisted us with directions and transportation, WILMA and ALLIZAD (sp?) also at the front desk, who were very helpful and friendly, DEVON (evening reception), AARON, and VICTOR (breakfast) who assisted us with our dining needs, JATIN (sp?) and OMAR at the front desk who answered any questions we had with patience and kindness. There were other staff members who helped us, but the above-mentioned 9 employees were PHENOMENAL!!!! We expressed our thanks to these fine workers through tips and verbal thanks and appreciation, but we would also like to let Trip Advisor know about the excellent, hard-working, pleasant, helpful, and devoted employees that are working at the Homewood Suites, 312 W 37th St, in NYC.

It was a new hotel and had everything you need. Yeah the rooms aren't huge, it is NEW YORK!! If you are in the room a lot, you are doing something wrong...Omar was the concierge and was wonderful. He answered any and every question we had regarding the city. I wish I would have seen him on Sunday so I could have rewarded him properly.I cannot say enough about how wonderful he was. The staff was good, yeah I am a HIlton Gold member and they didn't have my water bottles ready, but so what.I had a great rate, and would love to stay there again when I head back in December, but the rate is extremely high that date.I sincerely loved the room, new wood floors, the bathroom was great, large shower, clean etc.Even the elevators were fast!!!If you stay during the week, there is a meal, and free cocktails from 5-7. The breakfast was average, but it was FREE... I don't get people who complain about free stuff.The ONE negative was that the concierge at night told me wrong directions on how to get on the 7 train... Oh and another minor negative was it seemed the hotel front desk staff did not know how to get ANYWHERE.

Being a HHonor diamond member there is some expectation and trust in the Hilton brand. Based on this experience and trust, I booked my much awaited family vacation at this hotel. The customer experience we received is way inferior than other hotel stays of Hilton brand - Hilton, Double Tree, Embassy Suite, HGI, other Homewood suite, etc. The basic room services task did not get done like - cleaning the trash, making the bed, removing the used totel, filling up soaps/shampoo/lotions, filling up coffee/tea/creamer/sugar. Had to call the front desk and room service several times to perform some of these basic stuff during the duration of my 5 days stay, which on top of that was not done as per basic expectation of satisfaction guarentee. This was a total waste of hotel stay time, $$ amount, and all the massive points I have used to stay at this hotel during my family vacation.","Dallas, United States","Somu G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, United States</strong>",3,2.0

They didnt have any rooms available that slept all 4 of us but they certainly tried to find one for us. We knew this going in and it's typical for NYC. The room was very spacious by NY standards and we made it work. Actually it was HUGE in comparison to the Hilton fashion district. It had a couch, kitchen and walking room.
