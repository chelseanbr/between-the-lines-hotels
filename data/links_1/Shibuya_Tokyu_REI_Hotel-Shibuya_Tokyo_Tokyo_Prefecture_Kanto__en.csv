From outside it looks like nothing special. We go down the escalator we see the reception table but the girl led me to a machine on the side to check-in. I got a room with 2 single beds. No way was a double bed going to fit me and my 6’1 boyfriend which they said fits 2 people so spent a little extra to get 2 beds. Amenities like toothbrush, brush, Q-tips, little extras always go a long way for me. The water pressure of the shower was strong. I love the heated toilet seat and it had a bidet too. They give you night robes as well. The AC was not strong so it felt hot in the room. Good thing I bring my small travel fan.We were on the 11th floor, did not hear street noise but the train outside but it was ok soothing almost. The beds were not too comfortable so it wasn’t good for my bad back. The TV did not give you local TV stations, it only had movies which you had to buy movies. WiFi was almost nonexistent. But overall for a hotel in Shibuya it was pretty good. So many restaurants close to the hotel. Location was the amazing for a first time visitor to Tokyo. The entrance to the Shibuya Station was steps away from the hotel. Stayed for 5 nights and it was very pleasant. 4 stars!","San Francisco, California","SasMonti</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",38,4.0

Room was small but comfortable and had a hot pot for coffee and tea. Small bathroom but had amenities, i.e. bidet with temperature control. No closet but a space to hang your clothes. Breakfast had western and Japanese selection which was great. The only downside was we had an early flight so we were not able to avail of the breakfast. I tried to compromise if we could have some snacks before leaving for the airport since it was paid for, and they just said No. The other downside was since front desk was not street level, the escalator is not in operation before 6 a.m. It is a plight of stairs to carry your luggage up. They have to consider that mostly are tourists who have heavy luggages. It is unusual that a hotel would have to stop operations of its facilities that are constantly being used by guest. Otherwise a clean hotel.","Mississauga, Canada","Grace082</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mississauga, Canada</strong>",19,4.0

Very easy to find as was on the same side of the road as BIc Camera and McDonald’s. Checking in we got a trainee receptionist who had a senior male colleague lurking ominously behind her, no smile no eye contact, no acknowledgement of guest (us) (he was scary might even the hotel ghost ), I wanted to confirm our check out 18/7/19 and check in on the 19/7/19 was in order ( I only know greetings and thank you in Japanese) which seemed to confuse her , the senior made no move to help her , I did not persist), in another situation with the same unfortunate trainee, her trainer stepped in straight away to help (I asked if our bags could be held at the hotel).Room was small but good considering price and location, bathroom tiny, cleanliness was ho-hum. Walls were thin. Shampoo and conditioner were really good. Next trip would consider accomodation further out as subway is user friendly for newbies to Japan. Shibuya crossing 5mins away. Family Mart on one side of hotel and McDonald’s on the other. French bakery across the rd. Subway about a min away as well.

It was nice and clean with decent sized toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash) you can actually use (which seems to be part of the norm in Japan, but I still thought it was worth mentioning).There are close to no storage space for your clothes except for a small coat rack by the door. The breakfast buffet was great! It is subjective to taste, but they had some good Japanese selection. I didn't pay close attention to their western fare, because I am in Japan, why would I?They had a cute onigiri station that interchanges with the omellette station. I did enjoy that immensely.Everybody is saying it's a close walk from the Shibuya Station, which it is... but do note that if you are carrying luggage from Narita Express, it is more than 5 minutes because the platform for Narita is farther. I am not saying not to walk to the hotel, just don't think it would be easy (especially if you are caught with that rush hour crowd, oh boy).","Edmonton, Canada","Jill J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",3,4.0

Breakfast buffet is great with a wide range of western and Japanese food. I really liked that they had a juicer that served fresh pineapple and carrot juice.All receptionists and house keepers were professional and polite.Our room was a medium sized room which we were happy with.

The staff was polite and professional. Besides free wifi, not much else in terms of amenities.The location is the selling point of this hotel. If you want your home base to be in Shibuya, then you can't go wrong staying here. Shibuya Station is literally a 5 minute walk away. Tons of restaurants and shops all within a 10-15 minute walk away. Besides the musty smelling room, there is not much to complain about.

The check in process was efficient, and the hotel was easy to find, even from the Narita Express platforms at Shibuya station. Many other hotels comment on the rooms being small which is true however travelling solo I had no problems with space. The air conditioning in my room also worked perfectly when I used it in the summer months.The only criticism I would give was that the bathroom was a little crampt and a little old, however it was still better than many other hotels.

Check in was fast, they also had my Mifi at the front desk which i made arrangements to be delivered upon arrival. we had a room on 12th floor, double standard. typical size room for Japan, there was a desk big enough to plug in laptop and phones, refrigerator, hotpot, tea and coffee, 2 bottles of water daily. a lot of space for our luggage, we had 2 big suit cases and 2 small suit cases. 2 of them could fit under seating area next to the desk, one on suit case rack and the other in closet area. there are no drawers to put your clothes in, but i either hung them up or put them on shelf in closet. bathroom is small, but enjoyed soaking in the tub because it was deep. our stay included a breakfast buffet from 6:30 - 10 am. we ate there everyday since nothing really opens till 10 or 11 am unless you want to walk around shibuya to eat ramen or curry. the buffet is the same, every other day they have a omelet or musubi station. i suggest getting the breakfast because the food was pretty good, western and japanese style food available. plus from previous experience coming to japan, i hated having to look for some place to eat since i wake up early.the day before checking out, i asked the front desk if they could make arrangements for a taxi to pick us up at 7:30 pm to take us to Haneda airport and advised him we had 5 suit cases. He said he will try his best to get a big taxi. it was raining when we were checking out, i’m glad we asked ahead of time to take a taxi rather than dragging our luggage to bus station next to Excel Hotel. i was impressed when taxi arrived, they helped us take our luggage up the escalator, and walked us to taxi with umbrella to load it up! it cost us about $75 but it’s worth it rather than dragging suitcases through the busy streets of shibuya in the rain! overall, i would definitely stay here again. it’s close to the station but away from the busy streets of people walking about. the staff are very courteous. the room was clean and quiet, unless some one was making noise in the hallway. oh, there is a laundry room, ice machine, and vending machine on the 5th floor. on the first floor lobby, they have a smoking area too.thanks Shibuya Tokyu Rei, i enjoyed my stay at your hotel and excellent service.","Aiea, Hawaii","264michelet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aiea, Hawaii</strong>",6,5.0

Good staff and rooms are a bit larger than what you'd get in a business hotel. The rooms were clean but not spotless. I saw the cleaners working fast so I'm guessing that's more of an upper management issue. The rooms need a deep clean (dusty sprinklers etc) and current Japanese corporate cost cutting doesn't allow for this. It's also evident in the too warm, slightly stuffy rooms. I set the temperature at the minimum allowed (20c) but it felt more like 24c. When you're paying in excess of U.S.D 100 you should get to choose how cold you want to be.They might as well get rid of all those useless ""air ionisers"" or whatever that were a big craze in Japan a few years ago but now just gather dust and take up space.

Unfortunately we couldn't make it to the hotel breakfast in the morning, as our flight departure times meant we had to catch a very early Narita Express train.

As others have pointed out, location is certainly unbeatable - a block from the main artery of Shibuya - the Scramble, the shopping, the many restaurants - can't ask for a better located hotel. Shibuya is an ideal place to stay especially when travelling with young adults. We enjoyed the madness and excitement amidst the festive air - the quirky party bus, the Mario karts and not to mention, the occasional roaring of lamborghinis and Ferraris down the streets of Shibuya!Back to the hotel. Yes, rooms were small, typical of hotels of the similar price-range in Tokyo. We stayed in 2 twin-bedded rooms. At 16.2m2, the room layout was efficient, space was well utilised. No problem with having 2 big luggage bags in the room. We had a comfy place to rest to return to at the end of each evening. The level of service provided was nothing short of excellent. The front desk staff were most helpful to help us make dinner reservations on 23 and 24 Dec, which being super-peak season, were not easy to secure. But all was done with a smile. Luggage storage was also provided on the last day of our stay. Will I return? Definitely!","Petaling Jaya, Malaysia","SKsunnylady</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Petaling Jaya, Malaysia</strong>",39,5.0

Note that the hotel seems closest to the Shibuya train station Hachiko Sq exit. 15 mins to Roponggi and Omotesando via bus. Just get a PASMO (prepaid transpo card fr the airport) so you can freely use all bus and train lines.

After our first night here I approached reception to see if someone could check the air conditioning in our room. It was ridiculously hot and stuffy and I figured something was wrong. I was told that because it was spring the air conditioning was set for that season and no cool air was available, I was also told to ""just open the window"". With how loud the streets are and the fact that the window specifically says not to open it, and couldn't anyway, we just had to put up with getting next to no sleep in our hotbox room. We had also planned to leave our big luggage here for one night while we stay at Disney, we would be checking out Thursday and returning to check in Friday.

To share my notes from our 3 nights stay here.Location Notes:- Hachiko Exit #10 is just a few steps away from hotel entrance- BIC Camera dept store and McDonalds right around the corner - these can serve as your landmarks when locating the hotel for the first time.- Family Mart is a short walk , only about 3 bldgs away. It is NOT right next door as mentioned in one of the reviews posted.- About 5 mins walk to Shibuya Crossing.Room Notes:- No need to bring toiletries as hotel provides big bottles (dispensers) of Kanebo shampoo, conditioner, body wash. Of course you can't bring them out of the room.- As with typical Japanese hotel toilets, it is very small but designed nicely. - With hot/cold shower and small bath tub. Water pressure good.- Hair dryer power very weak - quite useless if you ask me, so if you're the type who can't go out without blow-dried hair then I suggest you bring your own.- Very thoughtful of the hotel to put a multi-plug charger attached to the wall beside the bed. This charger has USB, micro-USB, and all sorts of plug heads (not sure what the right term is) so very handy for your gadgets.- There's a ref and water pot/kettle. - Coin laundry, drinks and noodle vendo, and free ice dispenser on the 5F- Shoe brush, coat hangers, communal slippers available in room.Lobby staff very courteous as well. We rented a wifi unit which we requested to be shipped to the hotel and it was there when we arrived for check-in.Hotel lobby is on the basement, so after entering the hotel entrance on the street you have to take the narrow escalator downwards. But a large luggage will fit the escalator don't worry.

They have miso soup, bacon, rice, omelet, bread, pickled plums and fish. It was a japanese/american buffet which I thought was great. We had dinner there with a couple of friends who live in Yokohama and just ordered the special which turned out to be octopus curry. It was so tasty!

I confess to eating there every morning as the food was so healthy and fresh, and the environment, smokeless. Other than the Starbucks ( 5 minutes away), all the cafes and coffee shops are dense with smoke. On a roof top accross the street from the hotel is a large ( ten metre high) bowling pin! I don't know what it represents, but it was a perfect landmark, and made it easy to find my way back to the hotel! As I mentioned, the hotel did not include breakfast, and it cost 100 yen for 10 minutes of internet time on the computers in the lobby.

Apparently, rooms with two twin beds are larger than rooms with a double bed. We heard about the small size of hotel rooms in Tokyo and opted to bring our own little baby bed that's about the size of a drawer. It fit neatly under the bench seat in the room while still giving us a little bit of walking space.Make sure you do not exit out of the South exit of the JR Station, as we did, making the walk a little longer than we expected. Head north and it will be a short trek. Pack lightly! We brought two small suitcases instead of one huge one and it was a good choice since we did have to walk a while! There is a coin-operated washer and dryer on the 5th floor, which we used since we only brought clothes enough for 4 days. Our last morning there we washed our clothes before heading off to Kyoto. We asked for a 12:00 checkout time, which is at no extra cost. The dryer doesn't work well so we ended up hanging our clothes up to dry at our next hotel in Kyoto. The washer got the job done and we had clean clothes for the rest of our trip!Loved the location as there are so many stores and restaurants within minutes of walking distance! The night life is really happening!We also opted to not bring a stroller for the baby and it was good for Tokyo since you have to get around on so many trains. Going up and down the stairs to the train stations with a stroller would have been no fun at all.The front desk was very helpful and they speak a little English. Some of the staff members know more English than others. We did not try the restaurant, but went out to explore the town. To save a little bit, we bought rolls and yogurt from the nearby convenience store for our breakfasts. The post office is just around the corner. On the floor above the post office, you can exchange money.It also provides a light robe for you to wear to bed or before bed. In Kyoto, we stayed in Hotel Monterey Kyoto and pajamas are provided.

The only downfall is that you can hear some things through the thin walls, so if someone accidentally hits the wall it has a bit of an echo, but otherwise there were no issues. The cost was relatively expensive when compared to Australian standards, but we had booked through an agent so this may have contributed to the cost.

Also want a hotel that is next to the JR station & the ‘crossing’ - the area's major action spot. Really happy to have chosen Shibuya Tokyo Inn. Fits all criteria & our budget. Just 3 min walk to the hotel from the JR East exit. When back facing the station exit (ie. front facing main road ‘meji-dori’ & bus stop), turn left & continue along the main road to see the hotel sign. The front desk staffs speak good english. Check in only at 3pm even when we specified early arrival & our friends were given smoking rooms even when non-smoking rooms were reserved. Did get them changed easily when request again. The Double Room is nicely designed, slightly more spacious than usual Tokyo tourist class hotel, feels fresh with clean & quality bed sheets, pillows, carpet & a flat screen TV. The double-size bed is slightly smaller than queen-size. Very quiet room with good air-con (heard that’s available in summer only). Only down side is that there's no view except the back of another building. Enjoyed returning to our room every night or every time we dropped our bags. As for the western/japanese buffet breakfast (included), each dish r well prepared & delicious. Good selections but they r the same for the 3 days we stayed there.Many local eateries, happening restaurants (including the famous 'Lockup' jail-like restaurant), shops & dept stores to attack in the area. Again, when facing the main road ‘meji-dori’ at the hotel entrance, turn left, continue along the main road & u'll reach Harajuku in 15min. A pleasant walk. On the way to Harajuku, across the road, u'll see the 2 Burberry Blue Label & Black Label Harakuju boutiques just 5 min from the hotel, right after another traffic junction. (PS: Service in the boutiques r better than those in dept stores. They provide proper dust bags & packaging.)From Narita Airport, we took Narita Express to Shinjuku & change train to Shibuya. Despite previous experience, still make mistakes when changing train, probably overwhelmed by the peak hr crowds. There r direct Narita Express to Shibuya, but only certain schedules in the evening. If arrive early, suggest to take the Airport Limo Bus (3000yen) to Shibuya Excel Tokyo Hotel instead, to avoid the hassle of changing trains & platforms. We took Airport Limo Bus back to Narita Airport from Excel Hotel (book seats at the Tokyo Inn 1-day inadvance). Only 5 min walk betw 2 hotels, or pay about 800yen for a taxi if there r many luggages. Excel Hotel accepts luggage deposit at 500yen/pc. Overall, excellent location, comfortable & clean room, good price!
