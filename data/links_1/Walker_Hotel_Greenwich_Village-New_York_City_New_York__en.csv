Clean, quiet, staff at the front desk and housekeeping were welcoming and available at all times.We didn't eat at the cafe but heard some live jazz as we were heading out for the evening.When we headed out for breakfast, an hour later we came back to a clean and refreshed room.The rooms look red and blue online with a lot of light, so I was really disappointed that our room was drab brown and really dark unless you had the drapes open. The major drawback with that is that you can't do that at night, which made it difficult to look through suitcases and generally just be able to see well enough to get dressed.We had a two double bed room, so perhaps the higher end rooms were the ones with more space and looked like those pictures online.Aside from that, the nightly turndown service was nice with delicious cookies.The location was perfect, so you expect to pay more for that.I took off a star only because of how dark our room was.",,obaez8911,0,4.0

The bar area is very nice, was buzzing most of the times we were in it. Breakfast was good and huge portions! The restaurant looked nice and was busy so remember to book.

From the moment I reached out about booking a group reservation for a work trip, working with this hotel staff has been a dream.Literally no ask is impossible for superstar coordinator queen Isabel! Every request, no matter how tardy or inconsequential was handled without any back and forth within a matter of hours after it was made. Once our group arrived, many of us were allowed to check in early with no added charge.The space is so effortlessly chic and well-styled. Working out of the lobby was really pleasant (also, conveniently located close to transit and Union Square). We also dined in the restaurant one evening; the food was delicious and the ambiance was very sexy.The hotel staff went above and beyond at every opportunity to make this a pleasant stay. I received a hand-written note thanking me for choosing the Walker for my party and a fresh pair of cookies delivered to my in-room desk every day.The rooms are very trendy and waking up to a picturesque view of the Empire State building shining at me through my Juliet balcony was... not too shabby! And, can I just say, anyone complaining about room size is clearly visiting New York for the first time! If they could see my first New York apartment, they'd probably have an aneurysm. Bonus points for a well-outfitted gym in the basement level.All I heard from my team was how beautiful and charming the hotel was (and so many notes about great service).

It is always a pleasure to spend our yearly break in this lovely space. However, I did feel compelled to write a review to address some of the things that were noticeably deteriorating . In short it was really customer service. While there were a number of helpful staff , there was a sense that many of the staff were just not bothered. The front desk staff without exception were wonderful but the front area wait staff and the staff at the side desk were uninterested , unfriendly, unmotivated and generally unpleasant. One of the things that we always liked to do after a day in the city was to sit in front of the fire and have a glass of wine. By the end of our trip we were not inclined to do that mainly because of the unfriendliness of those staff. They were more interested in chatting to each other! A smile would have been appreciated, a personality of some sort or just regular customer service. All were missing.

Pros: * Restaurant still really good (we had room service one night). Lovely guy who took our room service order organised some basic pita bread for my daughter (menu is not particularly child friendly, but fabulous for me!) * Great location, lovely neighbourhood and handy having the Murray's Bagels and Chipotle nearby. Also had a really good dinner at Da Andrea across the road. Easy to get around by subway. * Lobby still lovely and live music Thurs/Fri/Sat nights. * We arrived around 4.30pm and our room wasn't ready, but they got us a round of drinks while we waited (which wasn't long at all!) Cons: * I was bummed to be a return guest (from Australia), book direct with the hotel, and still the get the room straight across from the elevator (i.e., the noisiest!). Maybe that is the only room with the two double beds. *Again, the beds are on wooden bases that catch your ankles and I see from other reviews I am not the only one! So bloody painful and easy to do given the rooms are NYC size (small!) * This time I found the room SO DARK. Like put every light on and can't find things you are looking for in your suitcase. * Housekeeping - we were missing robes, shower cap not replaced, etc. TV remote didn't work to turn on or off the TV (but did to change channels...) * They provide cookies at night, which is lovely, but even my sugarholic child wouldn't eat them, they just were not very good! *No help as a single adult with a child getting my bags from taxi to lobby or from lobby to taxi on departure (to be fair, there seem to be a LOT of ""squeaky wheel"" guests, and I am not one of those). * A lot of noise the last night. Like a fight or a party, I couldn't quite tell which. People in the hallway at 4am. Not the hotel's fault, but ugh. So inconsiderate in a small boutique hotel. On the upside, when I mentioned it to reception, they tried to apologise by getting me a coffee or something (I just didn't need anything, but appreciated the offer!) * Seems to just look more run down than when we were there two years ago. * No fridge or kettle/coffee making abilities.","Melbourne, Australia","jojoMelbourne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",72,4.0

Our stay was not comfortable at all really but was one of the only rooms in New York able to accommodate a family of four. It’s just such a shame they are so child-unfriendly.

The receptionists were very helpful, all of them and they provided guidance on transportation to certain touristic places and even went the extra mile and printed out directions on which subway to use and how to reach your destination. The room service was excellent and I always found cookies put in my room in the evening.

The bellman didn't tell us where the thermostat was, or that there was room service. There was no folio in the room, as you usually find in a hotel. One of the robes supplied (not Frette) had a threadbare belt-- really, tattered and with threads hanging from it. The shower didn't drain well. There were two inches of standing water, mid shower. The shower handle came off in my hand. When I put it back on, a sharp piece of metal on the back cut me (the size of a paper cut). The next day, I had forgotten, and the shower handle punctured another finger. The bathroom door handle came off as well. One of the two light bulbs in my nightstand lamp was burned out. Two nights, the hotel restaurant was not available to us, because it was hosting private parties. When I ordered room service for breakfast, they failed to give us cream for coffee or milk for oatmeal, even though we'd asked for it. By the time it was brought to us (with an apology), those cups of coffee were cold, and the oatmeal was lukewarm. I only told the front desk about the shower handle; that is a safety hazard. I wonder if they fixed it. The housekeeping staff were efficient and polite. Oh-- and I found out there's a fitness center after we checked out.

The room was nice and worked well for us. The only slight downside was the walls seemed to be a little thin. We could hear doors slamming throughout the night and a child crying early in the morning, but it wasn't anything too out of the ordinary for a hotel (especially in a busy city). We also had complementary water and brownies left in our room at the end of the night which was a kind touch. There is a cafe and bar downstairs that has cute decor and a nice atmosphere. We didn't eat there but sat for the afternoon to have some coffee and tea. Overall I think this hotel was a great spot to stay, especially for the night or weekend.

The Good:Relatively quiet in terms of street noise, away from the hustle and bustle of midtown. Out package included a prix-fixe breakfast every day, two tickets to the Whitney Museum, and a $50 Food and Beverage Credit.The prix-fixe breakfast choices at the Society Cafe were fine, but some menu items (eggs, salmon toast) were better than others (olive oil pancakes). Loved the fresh pressed juices, as well as the music choices. We also ate here one evening as well. Food is locally sourced.Plush robes in the room, nice assortment of bath products from a local apothecary on 6th Avenue.The Bad:While we were aware before booking that the room would be small, we weren't prepared for how small the Queen room would be for two people who had enough luggage for a five day stay. Not a lot of space to keep two suitcases, and nowhere to really sit and relax unless it was on the bed. We could also hear the person in the next room when they came in at night, and when they were drying their hair in the morning.Housekeeping would come far too late in the day - we called down one day and were told they cleaned rooms up until 5 pm (?!). There was one day we came in mid-afternoon wanting to rest before dinner and the room hadn't been made up yet. When housekeeping showed up, since my husband was sleeping I told her to just give me clean towels, and handed hers ours without the room being cleaned. The next day we returned to the room around 4ish. Again, the room was not made up. Since housekeeping was in the hallway, and we told her we would go down and wait in the lounge until she was done. The last morning we were there, she knocked on the room at 10:30 am (we hadn't checked out yet and were still packing, since check out is at 11). Soap was not replenished during our stay (thankfully there was enough to last until check out), and one afternoon, we had to call down for additional toilet paper, which they brought while we were out to dinner. When we checked in, the complimentary bottled water was not in our room, and we had to call down for it since we were dying of thirst.No ice bucket in room, no glasses (not even plastic cups), no pen and paper. One day when we called down for ice, it never arrived. Another day, they brought up the ice we asked for, but no glasses (?!).At breakfast one morning, while we were still working on our coffee, the waitress reminded us we had to leave our vouchers for breakfast on the table, as if we were going to run off without paying.I'd like to see a more polished look for the bellhops (can hard to tell in the lobby who is a bellhop versus who is a guest), but each one we dealt with was extremely helpful.For the price we paid, I'm not sure if I would stay here again for a future visit to NYC. I might if the price were right and I had a specific reason to be in the area.","Boston, Massachusetts","Bellefior</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",61,3.0

The wardrobe was only big enough for a few hanging items. 3 hangers! (Our daughter did have a slightly bigger room and wardrobe.) The bathrooms are tiny too. With an opaque glass door so not much privacy. Also a shaving mirror or magnifying mirror would be a great addition to the bathroom. I’m sure this would have all been fine if it had been for just one or two nights but any longer and it becomes irritating. The rooms are clean and tidy. The beds are comfortable.

I value the human component in a hotel stay highly, and the Walker gets top marks on this point. Everyone I had contact with, from making the reservation to my departure, including wait staff, cleaning staff, reception, room service, EVERYONE, was friendly, gracious, efficient, and exceeded in delivery whatever my actual request had been: amazing! Secondly, cleanliness: the hotel again receives my top marks with one odd exception: the outer entry of the hotel, which of course is the 1st point of contact on arriving, needs love. Maybe in the form of fresh paint, a new entry carpet, maybe a consultation with a lighting expert: my first moment was disappointing due to a soon-dispelled sense of the shabby. I hope management, which excels in many areas, takes note of this review and spruces the entry up. Everything else was wonderful, but a first impression has a way of lingering. Thirdly, the in-house restaurant is fantastic. My first night, I arrived late, tired, hungry and was swiftly shown to a fabulous corner banquette where I enjoyed warm and efficient service and an absolutely delicious meal. It felt like my life was saved. Next, if you can book a room in a high floor with a south facing view, do so. The view outside my 17th floor room was cinematically perfect: I owned downtown!

It's a cute space and the breakfast is fine. Service was very friendly at the hotel and they even texted after the first night to make sure we were happy. I wanted to be near NYU as my son was moving there after our stay. I would definitely recommend if you want to be in this area.

So I went downstairs, my luggage still unpacked, and checked out. They told me that they understood, and apologized for the inconvenience. I was okay with this ... and I found another hotel nearby that was much nicer and is my new go-to spot in Manhattan.Then, to my surprise, at the end of the week in NYC, I found out that the Walker Hotel billed me for a night and has since refused to back down or credit this back. Unbelievable. I stayed in the room for no more than five minutes before leaving.

I stayed at the hotel for a week and whilst there are many positives, there are also some drawbacks, which left me with a slightly mixed view of the hotel. On the positive, the decor is appealing and a lot of effort has gone into ensuring all aspects of the hotel are aligned in art deco style. All the way from the entrance, restaurant, lifts and rooms with lovely rotary telephones. Even the gym is decked out in very charming style. The rooms are on the small side, however, definitely not the smallest I've encountered in New York. Whilst the bed was comfortable, the bedding is very light, and I found the room very cold, however, the heating was incredibly loud, so it was hard to sleep with that running. I also found whilst the rooms had good sound-proof between rooms, it's very noisy if someone is knocking on the room next door, which unfortunately seemed to happen at late and early hours for my neighbours! One of the very nice touches of the hotel was returning to find different home-baked style cookies in the room after turndown, which is a lovely touch. I also had room service delivered from the restaurant on a number of occasions, and there was a really nice menu available, the food was delicious and the service was friendly, professional and prompt. I found the breakfast selection a little limited, however, the restaurant is a nice spot to sit and start the day. I did find the bar experience disappointing, I was joined by friends and the bar area itself was very busy, and so we were directed to the lobby as we weren't eating, so weren't able to sit at the tables, although at the time it appeared rather empty. However, the service was very slow and quite disinterested. I then asked to put the bill on my room and was told that was not possible, however, once I flagged that this was very inconvenient, I was told they would sort something out. i also used the gym, which was small but very well equipped for a quick workout with nice running machines, weights and mats etc which was all clean and in good order. Overall it's hard to find a great hotel in New York. I think this one is getting there with some minor changes.","London, United Kingdom","Ms_CC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",55,4.0

The view was incredible, all the way downtown and could clearly see OWO.What I liked - the lobby of the hotel and its Art Deco design, the location is great and it was very easy to get around Manhattan between walking and the close location of the subway. The petit-fours delivered by housekeeping in the afternoon were a nice touch. The view from our room was great to wake up and the sunsets were incredible.What I didn’t like - the NOISE. Wow. I’ve stayed in a lot of hotels, but the noise in this hotel is worst I’ve ever experienced. I thought my bed was right next to pipes or that I was sleeping in the elevator itself with all the clanging through the night. We were high enough up to not hear the street noise, this was purely internal. The beds were also lumpy and way too soft to the point of making it uncomfortable to sleep. The heavy shower handle fell off one morning and narrowly missed my foot. There is no fridge in the room (yes I’m sure it says that in the available room facilities, but it was still frustrating to not be able to store things for breakfast or snacks).But the worst thing of all, was when I asked front desk for advice on getting to JFK airport, they said to allow 30-45 mins for getting there in a cab. Thank god I added in 45 minutes contingency on that 45 minutes, as we made our check-in with 7 minutes to spare when there was traffic en route to JFK. Overall, the great location and wasn’t enough to cover the general disappointment of the stay, and you can definitely find similar, better value hotels on Manhattan.","Melbourne, Australia","love_weekenders</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",163,2.0

Our initial experience with the Walker was very good albeit brief (one night cut even shorter by spending much of it with a friend's trip to an Emergency Room).All of the hotel staff we met (front desk, restaurant, service) were cheerful, kind and personable. In conversation, they were focused on making their guests welcome. We had a brunch and a breakfast at the hotel. The ambiance of the room and the quality and variety of the menu evidenced a desire and success in rising above an average and forgettable hotel eatery.The lobby of the hotel is charming, with plenty of inviting nooks and crannies where you can relax and have a civilized conversation. Our room was small but clean, quiet and with a bit of art deco personality. The neighborhood is distinctive and convenient, more residential and interesting than mid-town. It is a good vantage point for exploring the city, and I speak as someone who grew up in Brooklyn and Manhattan. While we have yet to adopt one hotel in NYC as our own (as we have done in Paris, Dublin and a number of other cities), we would definitely return to the Walker.

The Walker has a great location in greenwich Village, very near Chelsea. It's a small-ish but elegant boutique hotel with great character and charm.I found it through my StashAwards account - it's not formally part of the Stash Awards system, but I was able to earn Stash points there. Stash then pushes the rez through booking.com, which was a very easy and smooth process.This is not the cheapest hotel in New York, but nor is it the most expensive. I would estimate it to be pretty much down the middle. The only availability (last minute booking) was a Grove Queen room. The room was small, but that's to be expected in older hotels like this. It was well-decorated in what I would call modern deco. My only specific ""complaints"" are that the bed was too low (though that's irrelevant once you are lying down), and I couldn't stand at the bathroom sink with the door bathroom door open as it was such a tight space.Nonetheless, I enjoyed my stay there, and would readily consider staying again.

On this trip however, our mission was to take kids to see Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. We wanted to pick a cozier, neighborhood hotel.I was underwhelmed with the room size, which I would describe as perhaps the smallest I’ve ever had in NYC- and I’ve been staying in hotels primarily in Manhattan (and some in Brooklyn) for over 20 years. It was a 250 dollar room at best, certainly not 300+. Our shower door in the bathroom had a broken hinge, which prevented it from closing properly, and the bathroom ceiling needed to be repainted. The air conditioning and heating seems to run pretty constantly, without every impacting the room temperature. TV in the room was quite small- maybe 32-35 inches? Nit-picking aside, we had a situation the morning we were checking out, where one of the kids got sick in the room. I called down to get some help, or cleaning supplies, or extra towels, etc. now- obviously this is not pleasant, but as a parent you get pretty blasé about cleaning up stuff like this, which I did. What I found really disappointing was the time it took to get anyone to show up and drop of towels, or offer any help at all. Eventually, about two hours later, and after several calls down to the front desk- someone came up and dropped off some towels. 3-4 hours later, housekeeping came up to the room and kind of tried to help- but didn’t actually do anything other than ask what had happened. (Usually in these situations, you spray down the carpet with some cleaning products, vacuum, etc)On top of that- I had left an extra tip in the room for housekeeping, on top of what I leave usually, but realized when we were at the airport that I had left a 150 dollar set of Bluetooth headphones in the room. I called the front desk 2-3 times over the next several hours trying to see if housekeeping had found them or if someone could check the room. Despite the front desk staff promising that they would call me back, they never did. It’s a fact that cleaning staff sometimes grab stuff in the rooms, but that’s usually why you send someone up to the room to check for stuff before it’s cleaned. The fact that the staff didn’t seem to really care, or make any effort, is really what dropped this review to 2 stars. Also worth mentioning that the staff handed us a card upon leaving asking for a favorable review on TripAdvisor, so they seem to have their influence/social media campaign on point. Ironically, that prompted me to leave this. Every business has off days- but the housekeeping issues and stolen/lost item happened on the day we were leaving and really was the nail in the coffin. There are hundres of hotels in which one could find larger rooms with more up to date amenities and better service. I’m sure someone from the stafff will immediately leave a throughtful, elegantly worded response just below this review, but I really needed the help when I was there, and I hope someone on the housekeeping staff enjoy their new headphones.",,The_evaluation,8,2.0

Chef Zabita and his team are constantly pushing out mouthwatering dishes made with the freshest ingredients. If you're coming here for Brunch, the pancakes are a must.

There was no space for luggage and only one small closet with four hangers and three tiny drawers. While we were there, our shower broke and the fire alarm went off in the middle of the night—false alarm. The housekeeping service was hard to figure out, sometimes they came, sometimes they didn’t. Even when you posted the sign on the door, it was hit or miss, no rhyme or reason. I will say that the staff was super friendly and welcoming. No matter who you spoke to in the hotel or restaurant, the hospitality was amazing. The other thing I loved is that they left cookies for you daily which were made daily in the restaurant. We loved them so much, we tried to purchase some. We requested a specific kind, they charged me for it, then brought out a plate of completely different cookies, stating they didn’t have them anymore. That night at dinner, the lady recognized me and said that they were making the ones we wanted and would bring them to our room the next day. The cookies showed up, but were again the wrong ones. Both plates of cookies were thrown out. I would not recommend this hotel and won’t be returning.

Also, the air conditioning vent is EXTREMELY loud. If you like to sleep with white noise, then you will be fine. The staff is indifferent.

We booked two rooms. I have visited NYC 4 times and this is my favorite location. The neighborhood felt very safe. We even let the teenage boys roam around on their own. There were several places to eat within a few blocks and lots of shopping. The actual street it was on was very quiet. There is a subway station very close and it is centrally located in NYC.The staff was friendly and helpful. The lobby was beautiful. There are stairs going down when you first come in, so keep that in mind if you have a disability. The floors are marble and become slick when wet.The room was small, but all NYC rooms are. It was decorated in a beautiful art deco style. We were on the 13th floor and had a nice view of the city. The room was clean and the beds and pillows were comfy. There is a very tiny closet and a little bench that you can put your suitcase on, but not much room anywhere else. The bathroom has one of those showers that sprays you in the face as soon as you turn it on. There isn't much counter space for your makeup,etc. The toiletries supplied were shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, soap, cotton balls, shower cap and makeup remover towelettes. Other than the shampoo and conditioner, nothing was replaced after the first night, but I'm sure they would have if I had asked. The water pressure in the shower was GREAT. The room was quiet. The a/c was very loud, but maybe that drowned out other noises. I occasionally heard doors slamming, but not often. I didn't hear any street noise other than when we opened the window (which only opens a crack by the way). There were no USB charging plugs in the room and nowtenough regular plugs by the nightstand. I would recommend they add a little more. Also, the room is really dark overall including the bathroom. A lighted makeup mirror would be a nice additon.The restaurant downstairs was nice but expensive. I got a glass of house chardonnay that was $20 and we spent about $130 on breakfast for the 4 of us one day.There is a nice Italian restaurant across the street named Da Andrea that I would highly recommend. It was adorable and priced reasonably.","Columbus, Ohio","hilohiomom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",47,5.0

The shower in the room I stayed in is separated from the rest of the bathroom only by a short curtain and the water is really pressurised, so even if you are careful you will soak the whole room. The water stagnates on the floor because the drain is badly fitted, with a tall edge that stops water from flowing in. There are stains in the sink, which also wobbles, signs of water damage on the ceilings just to name a few. The staff wasn’t welcoming, and neither very professional in dealing with an issue in the kitchen that delayed our breakfast. The food quality is also disappointing.

The walls are very thin and the doors are very heavy, so expect to hear a chorus of loud banging in the morning and evening and other guests wake up and come home. I recommend bringing earplugs (seriously - it’s very loud). The housekeeping is very scattershot - some days they replaced towels and robes, some days they did a turn down service, every now and again they’d leave water. The bathroom was never very well cleaned and always seemed to have other people’s hair on the floor. The door banging, intermitant towel replacement, and slightly dirty bathroom didn’t bother me that much because I was traveling for work (ie not travelling on my own dime), but at $400/night the Walker should sort those issues out for paying guests.","Toronto, Canada","WonderingCanadian416</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",31,3.0

My room, as expected, was small. The narrow armoire had two dresser ""drawers"" that were roughly the size of a shoebox each and one was storing a hair dryer.. There is only a couple of inches of space on each side of the toilet, with the shower on one side and the sink/vanity on the other.. There is a tiny nightstand on each side of the bed, with a top shelf on each side largely taken up by a lamp and a phone. That said, there are a lot of nice touches. The bathroom is done in marble tile and there was always hot water with good water pressure in the shower. The amenities include body wash, shampoo and conditioner from C.O. Bigelow (and if you like them, they're just a short walk away from the hotel). The towels were large and substantial, not thin. The room is decorated in darker woods and has a historic vibe. There's a small desk and office chair, and then a padded chair in the corner of the room. Due to the room size, my suitcases essentially became an ottoman for the padded chair because there wasn't anywhere else to put them.While I was not in the room most evenings, the one night I was, there was the pleasant surprise of the hotel delivering two bite-sized lemon macarons. I also ordered room service one evening from the onsite restaurant and it was delivered promptly. The bed was not to my liking.. First, it's a mattress on a platform, so it was softer than I prefer. That's a personal choice, though, so I don't consider that a mark against the hotel. However, I found myself remaking the bed most evenings because the bottom flat sheet needs an exacting alignment to cover at both the top and bottom of the mattress. Being tall, if the coverage was at the top, my feet were on bare mattress at the foot of the bed. I 'd prefer a fitted sheet that fully covered the mattress, but barring that, I had to redo the bedsheets with the gap above the pillow at the top so that my feet were on the sheets.at the bottom.Overall, it was a decent place to stay and the staff interactions were always pleasant...help with suitcases coming in, someone holding the door during afternoons and evenings. If you're traveling solo for business or pleasure and can get around in the confines of a smaller-sized room with your gear, this is a fine choice.","Omaha, Nebraska","HuskerFlyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Omaha, Nebraska</strong>",27,4.0

The Empire State Building was framed perfectly from our room, just past the rooftops and water towers of midtown Manhattan. We had a quiet balcony, a giant bathroom and a comfortable bed. We loved breakfast at Society Cafe inside the hotel, not to mention Murray's Bagels just around the corner.

The rooms, if not a little on the small side, were more than adequate, very clean and equipped, after all, we were sightseeing and rarely in there only to change and sleep. The staff, Nancy, Angel, Keith but in particular the Concierge (Marcus) were all extremely helpful, cooperative and professional in their approach and attention to detail and above all consistently demonstrated a ‘One Team’ and ‘Can Do’ work ethic or policy. I took delight one afternoon, having flashbacks, to the early 80’s and the ‘hip hop’ days in a short discussion I had with Marcus relating to Afrika Bammbataa, Johnson Crew (Space Cowboy) and DJ Hurc but in general the beat from the Bronx.On a more serious note but to conclude; I and we all, can thoroughly recommend this hotel and all its staff to provide a very clean and comfortable stay.Thankyou again to all the team at the Walker Hotel.","Bolton, United Kingdom","glasses55</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bolton, United Kingdom</strong>",8,5.0

Is five days worth the same as five weeks in ex. Thailand for the same amount? My review is much about if I feel its worth 600$ for a single room each night at this hotel. I will say no, N.Y is not that for me. Before I get to the things I don't like with the hotel I have to say the staff are friendly, polite and that the atmosphere in the lobby and bar is very nice.If I shall mention the negative it is that rooms are old. They are similar to how the rooms did look in Bangkok in the 1990`s. Also see the TV-serie ""Patrick Melrose"" that shall be in 1982, they got same design in the rooms. Madrass is soft and kind of well used, but after walking for twelve hours daily I sleep as I was in coma. But as you see in photo I did have some poop stains in the top mattress, these was there for all five days. I did not want to lift the rest of blanket. I'm glad I am not a traveller with black light (UV-A), think maybe I would have problems to sleep.When it comes to problem to sleep, you got a alarm censor over your bed. If you just move as much as a toe it will light up a strong red lamp. Literally if you move your toe. Why this censor is there I don't know, there is no system that register if I leave my room. So this must just be on when the room is not rented out. Well, if you are a little paranoid and don't like the feeling about be monitored - this is not the place for you. Also, the shower did need some maintain. But for me its not any problem, I just mention it in this review so it can be rated against value.All of N.Y. was the same, no toilet brush in toilets. Thats maybe the American culture, like to have people clean your .... up after you. I did leave 5$/room for the housekeeper daily, but even so I am not comfortable to leave a bear cub for her in the toilet. RESTAURANT - this was not an good experience. We did sit down one evening at 5:30 PM before we should go for Broadway. Empty restaurant, ask for table, had to check if available. OK, order steak and lamb. 45 minutes after order I did say that if not food comes we must leave. Ten minutes later comes, chewy meat and nothing special. This restaurant is nothing even close to worth the money - Sorry chef!So to check out; when we did check out 5th of May they ask if i wanted an invoice on mail. Two rooms x five days was 5000 $. I did say yes please, send to my email. Did not get the mail, but see that they 7th of May, two days after payment have charge us additional around 600 $. 8th of May I send them this mail; ""Hello. After check out your receptionist did tell me that you would send me an copy of the invoice at mail. I can’t find any mail, can you please send me a new copy on both rooms. I also see you have charged my card once more at 7th of May, please send me information about this in invoice. Have a nice day. Best regards .......""No response, send a copy 13th of May and have still not get any answer. They had no problem with recive mail when I did book room directly, but now they don't get it apparently. In the end I will say, I am not a type that complain or have give them any trouble. My holidays is for short to use it for any complain. They got an honest review instead. Will I ever go back to N.Y and use this amount on a room that will cost 30$/night in Phuket or 50$/night in Bangkok, or like 100$ in Oslo, Norway? No, thank you.

Travelling in winter, NYC is cold. The room was chilly, so I put the heating on. Between going to sleep and waking up at 3am, I'd gone from freezing to being in a sauna. Looking at the thermostat it was now 7 degrees above the temperature set. Reception just said that it was an old building and to be expected - none of the thermostats worked.My plan for the subsequent night was to keep the room cooler, but the bedding was very thin (so you have to ask for an additional quilt, which took over three hours to arrive and needed chasing).When the heating is on, it's very noisy and annoying.The smoke detector (besides being positioned in such a way that it wouldn't detect any smoke!) has TWO lights that flash quite brightly EVERY SECOND. The hotel said this was normal, and offered to turn off my detector (which I declined, and suspect would violate various fire regulations).There is a motion detector for the heating that is bright and makes a faint high pitch noise every time it's triggered. It picks up movement in bed, so is again, very annoying and hinders sleep.There is NO sensible storage. Yes, there's a wardrobe, but nothing else. No space in the bathroom to leave more than a toothbrush (and after you use a glass, they do not replace it, so I had 3 our of 4 nights with one glass, not two in the bedroom). I had to leave all my toiletries on the desk. The desk is cluttered and has little space to do any work. The bedside table is very small - you can just fit a phone and bottle of water on it. Unlike even budget hotels, there is no paper or pens provided in the room. The lighting in the room is very poor. With the curtains closed, there are two bedside lights and a small desk lamp, these give a nice subtle light in the main part of the room, but not enough to work/pack/unpack etc... The other lights are by the door but don't light the main part of the room.The staff seem to have little knowledge of the city. I needed a new pair of jeans and asked for nearby shops, and I was directed quite a few blocks away, and not to the Levi store one street away!For a luxury hotel, it's missing a lot of the standard in-room items. There is no kettle/tea/coffee facilities, no mini bar, no paper, no pen, no shoe polish, no flannels/face cloths, The inside of the wardrobe was quite dusty, and not ideal for storing clothes.As an able bodied traveller, it's hard for me to pick up on what an accessible room may need. There are clearly some well thought out things here, such as the low racks in the wardrobe (but this prevents hanging long coats/items), low level peep hole for the door, locks at a sensible level etc... However they've positioned various elements of furniture so I think that a wheelchair would struggle to get around the room. The desk would not be easily usable, and plug sockets would not be easy to get to. There's a wet room which is good, but the support bars are positioned so that the toilet seat won't stay up. Also having a wet room means once you've showered you can't go back in.The room service food was pretty poor. My fries were all burnt and pretty bland, and it was basically $35 for an average burger.Some elements of the hotel are good, such as the style, but overall I can pretty confidently say I won't be staying here again, and will recommend colleagues to look for alternatives.","West Wickham, United Kingdom","EonsOfZaphod</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Wickham, United Kingdom</strong>",150,2.0

Pros and (minor) cons below.Pros:* I loved the location - easy walk to multiple subway stops and things like a Chipotle, Rite Aid (chemist/drug store) and Murray's Bagels within a few hundred metres. Definitely recommend the weekly subway pass for $31 per person (no discount for kids), we were only there 5 days but it was the easiest and most economic way around.* The lobby is gorgeous, lovely to sit and while away a few hours.* Restaurant also very good - not particularly kid friendly menu, but great for adults and kids with more sophisticated palates!* Happy hour Monday - Friday, great prices on wines and beers and pizzas.* Overall it was pretty quiet - we had bad jet lag and there was noise during the day (housekeeping, guests chatting in hallway), but not their fault given the time it was!* The hotel is small enough that I felt comfortable leaving my 8yo in the room and hanging out downstairs in the restaurant or lobby - she could easily come find me.* Free Wifi, always a plus!* Overall the staff were helpful - they didn't sometimes know the answers to questions I had (e.g. about subway - the closest stop was unfortunately closed for uptown trains the weekend we were there), but the staff were well intentioned.* Little bakery treats at bedtime!Cons:* The rooms are, being NYC, tiny. This was fine, except for the fact we had two double beds (as requested) and the beds are on solid wood bases that stick out from under the mattress. I lost count of how many times one of us clocked our ankle on the frame. Perhaps consider adding some padding? I know it seems petty, but as my daughter lamented after doing it once again ""This is the only thing I don't like about this hotel"".* The house keeping was ok but not great. There were hairs on the wall of the shower when we arrived. The shower cap not being restocked after I used it. Empty wine glasses from the bar being left on the desk the next day. Towels seemed to be replaced/replenished in a hit or miss manner. Nothing earth shattering, but not what I am used to (maybe because I travel a lot for work in Asia).

I have a lot of nice things to say and 2 concerns.First: on arrival (december 31st) I found polite people that supported me in upgrading the room: I’ve tried to book for months a waverly queen but on line booking could not guarantee city view, therefore I booked on Booking.com a Grove Queen and upgraded when the lady at the desk confirmed she had a wonderful room on 17th floor (room 1703). My first complaint is about reservation: why didn’t you book a city view room for me the first time I asked, in october? Why did you always reply you could not guarantee?The room was nice, bed was comfortable, pillows were too thick (I’ve asked for thin pillows but didn’t get) but house keeping was amazing. Our room was cleaned twice a day, every night when the maid came for bed turndown she left two small cakes for us: we appreciated a lot. City view was stunning (freedom tower), room was warm when outside nyc was freezing. Toiletries were replaced everyday and highest quality, plenty of towels and large shower. The second concerns refers to the fan inside the bathroom that could not be switched off: as a result we always kept the door closed (you can’t even sleep with door opened) and in the bathroom temperature was much lower compared to the room. A switch to turn down the fan would be perfect. The lobby with fireplace is so cozy and Society Cafè deserves a visit: we had cocktails before dining out, a pizza and an excellent breakfast. On our last day we had room service and everything was well appointed. Coming back to the hotel after walking in the snow or freezing on the sunny days was a pleasure. The staff gave us enormous support on our departure day, not only storing the luggage but arranging the limo to the airport, and waiting with us outside with 10*F (-12 celsius) to load our bags. The hotel is perfectly located near 14th street metro, a 5 minutes walk with the snow, 3 minutes in normal weather conditions.

The location was perfect for our needs and the staff was extremely accommodating, super friendly and efficient. We stayed in the Grove Queen which was lovely but small.

Once I unplugged the lamp, I couldn't see what I was doing since the only overhead light was in the small foyer.There was a small armoire that served as a closet with three small drawers inside. The pulls on the armoire doors were slippery, making it difficult to open them. The very tiny nightstands that were attached to the bed were occupied by lamps that took up all the space on the nightstands.

The Walker is very well located and very attractive. I pulled up and had a bit of trouble finding it at first as it blends in very well and looks like a neighborhood building. You go down a wide stair case into a small but very cozy and cute lobby. That's when things hit a hitch. I had a two night stay planned and an early dinner appointment on the first night. I arrived at 255 (checked on Uber app) and check-in at front desk. The Clerk has some trouble finding the reservation but eventually gets it. He says my room will be ready in five minutes and I should just have a seat in lobby. I realized I had forgotten some toiletries so tell him I am going to run out while they finish and will be back in 15 minutes. I get back at 315. New clerk at desk. He asks me a bunch of the same questions and then says my room is not ready. I told him other clerk said 5 minutes and it had been 20. He says they were very busy. At 330 I try again. He tells me housekeeping is just finishing and offers me two drink coupons for the wait. At 345 still no word and he tells me he can't get in touch with housekeeping. At 4 I finally go up ready to move to another hotel my TA found and the other clerk says ""oh yes, it was ready a few minutes ago."" Of course I was sitting 10 feet in front of him. Now I might say it was a one time issue but woman next to me was irate as well. She checked in early morning and asked them to call her when room was ready. She came back at 4 saying no one had called but she assumed it was ready. Clerk says, oh we don't call you; we assumed you would keep checking in with us. Really, maybe at a Motel 6 but not at your rates.Once upstairs the room was very nice. Very artdeco, dark woods. Feels very luxurious. My room had a nice view South towards Freedom Tower. Room needs more lights. Other than foyer light thee are three small dim table lamps that all point down and so don't illuminate the room. Bathroom was small but nicely done. Very nice toiletries. Restaurant is tucked in the back of the ground floor and is hard to spot. It is cute and breakfast was tasty and reasonable. They have a few fixed price breakfast deals. The Salmon toast was quite good. Did not eat dinner, but had a couple drinks at bar.  It is a small area in restaurant. Not too exciting but drinks were very well done and bartender quite friendly and helpful. Fitness room is very small. Two machines and some weights. Probably not adequate for more than a one or two night stay.I debated whether to view this as a three star or four. The service issues are a real problem. But the room was very nice and bedding was excellent so it won out.

We called the front desk and they said the ""engineer"" would come and check it. He never came. 3) Saturday night the fire alarm went off 2 times. When trying to go down the stairs, several levels were completely blocked by the housekeeping carts. This is a MAJOR fire hazard. Upon getting down to the front desk, they said the kitchen set off the fire alarm. They set it off again also. This was a big inconvenience 2 times going down the obstructed stairs (and back up them since elevators were shut off due to alarm)4) corners and baseboards dirty5) rate was not clear as it said ""total price"" on reservation; however, upon arrival that is the basic rate and then they add taxes and fees on top of the ""total price"" rate. 6) the wifi is not good and is inconsistent.

The class of room I’d booked didn’t feature a tub, and it was a $200 upgrade that I decided to skip. The hotel is interesting layout. Enter street level, walk down a flight of stairs to a lovely lobby on one side and restaurant behind, and elevators in between. My room was tiny but that wasn’t an issue; and I loved how quiet it was. The bed was incredible and very nice linens. My little room was an Art Deco haven. I felt safe and cosy. The cleanliness was ~almost perfect, but some details overlooked: dusty lampshades (floor corners too) and fixtures coming off the wall (hand towel bar) or into my hands (shower handle). The hotel was quick to fix the reported issues, but guests shouldn’t have to encounter those problems. Also, at least once a day I ordered room service, including hot water for tea, as well as an ice bucket in the same order, and one item would always be missing. I felt bad for the delivery person to have to go back and would double tip them. By the third time this happened, I was pretty annoyed, so I’m mentioning it here. I know they’re a small hotel so being more organized will help with efficiency and not overworking the staff.As far as the food from the restaurant, it’s pricey but certainly delicious. I liked the pasta and the beet dishes best, as well as the cookies! At night turn down service would leave little treats- all were fabulous.One day it rained; the hotel has umbrellas available to loan. Great touch! I enjoyed every person I interacted with: housekeeping, front desk, concierge, bellhop, room service... all very nice folks. The Walker Hotel is centrally situated in the Village, is a beautiful space, comfortable to stay in and (mostly) very clean and restful. Here are some suggestions: general maintenance ought to be stayed better on top of; pay closer attention to the room service orders. Fixing those issues would make this hotel a top notch place to stay. ",,nobizit,35,4.0

The bartender said ""white wine or red wine?"" ""The Bar is closed.""I mean, this is New York, right? 11:30? Well, apparently the bar was not actually closed, since there was a bartender, and he was able to muster up the strength to pour two wines. Just NOT beers or cocktails. He was also very anxious to point out that the drink vouchers did NOT include a gratuity for his wine-pouring. And, he also informed us that we needed to consume our beverages in the hotel lobby, as in : get out of here. Tacky. Not at all with the hip vibe the hotel is attempting to portray. You might think that is understandable, since they do need to close up shop at some point, even if 11:30 on a Saturday evening sounds more like Greenwich, KS than Greenwich Village. (Nothing against Kansas, I know the bartenders are more courteous there). However, when we went back to the elevator bank near the bar 20 minutes later the same people that were in the bar earlier were still in their booth sipping.

Typically ADA rooms are offered at a lower cost because many people (myself included) do not like the change in configuration - namely the shower area as it is typically designed to accommodate someone in a wheelchair. Bottom line was that they did not have any more regular rooms so I was given a room with 2 smaller beds for my first night. That evening I wrote an email to the General Manager expressing my dissatisfaction with the situation (cause this is not a low cost hotel nor a Springhill Suites).

If my visit had gone smoothly, it would have been five. Given what happened during the visit, it should be three. So four is a compromise.Having added an extra night to my original three night booking, I had an inkling that there might be a problem, so I made a point of speaking to one of the many and changing receptionists before going out on the third morning. Later on I was telephoned while in Central Park to be told I should have checked out at 1l. I explained the situation again, but when I got back, I was told I needed to check in as a new guest. To do that I needed photo ID. I pointed out that the photo ID was in my room. But no photo ID, no room card. A perfect Catch-22. Fortunately another receptionist came along and vouched for me, but it spoiled what was otherwise a very happy stay.The room was extremely comfortable, with good storage space, and the bonus of Bigelow's products in the bathroom. Despite being on a fairly busy street, the room was very quiet.The downstairs lounge is a good place to sit, and drinks are offered, though there's no problem if you just want to sit.

Subway stations were close by as well. The hotel itself has a beautiful exterior and nice lobby. A fireplace and seating area is cozy and comfortable. We didn't try the restaurant and bar as there were so many great choices nearby (Le Pain Quotidien and the Corner Bistro a few blocks away were great for breakfast and lunch, respectively). I did have some minor complaints. As others have written, the room was not well lit. The air conditioner was from a previous century, placed into the wall and would constantly turn on/off. The air conditioner was also quite loud. Since we were on the second floor, we preferred to use the stairwell. It would be nice if the staff could clean the stairs as it was not clean (small bits trash of the floor, dust, a ladder in the way). But my biggest complaint was the lack of storage space in the room- the room did not have a dresser and only a small closet space. We lived out of our suitcases for a week. Unacceptable. As far as comfort in the room was concerned- (with the exception of no dresser) the bedding was fine for us. The bathroom was clean and well designed. Bath amenities were very nice. Maid service was excellent. A sofa chair was comfortable. The rug however was well worn and could use a replacement. In the lobby, the front staff was personable but not at the professional level of finer hotels. Some of the drawbacks for this hotel can be easily remedied- like adding a dresser to rooms and more service training for the front staff. I would seriously consider updating the lighting and climate control if this were my hotel. Doing so can move this hotel from a good boutique hotel to a top level experience. Will I return? Can't beat the location, the cozy feel of the place. For a short stay-yes. For a week or so, maybe not; it's the little things that count- like a dresser for your clothes, adequate lighting- that can make or break one's decision to return.

It has a stylish Art Nouveau aesthetic with a fine looking lobby as you descend the stairs from the street level. Check-in was friendly and quick and compared to some tiny Manhattan hotels, you don't feel as cramped at the Walker - with two fast elevators and a nice lobby area to lounge in. They even gave us two complimentary drinks to the attached bar (Society Cafe) which we used on our last night. The rooms themselves are nicely appointed, with a decent bathroom, robes, and complimentary water. Closet space was decent though not huge. The only minor drawbacks (which take it from an excellent / outstanding hotel to a very good one) were: 1) very dark room, three small lamps were all that were available to light the room, making it almost impossible to even read at night; 2) inconsistent AC - turned on powerfully blowing cold air for a few minutes then turned off till it became too hot again; 3) tiny hard pillows - barely the size of your head, with no others to use!

The bathrooms are great, the location is very convenient, room service is quick and the rooms are comfortable even if a bit small. The one gripe is the Walker Terrace room that I booked. The website says they have a ""large furnished terrace"". On the 17th floor that is true. On the 18th floor, that is not true. The ""terrace"" is not a terrace unless you mean the literal definition of a terrace, a ""a level paved area or platform next to a building; a patio or veranda."" It is probably 4 feet deep and there is no furniture. You could stand out there to look at the city and have a smoke (I don't smoke) but that's about it. The rooms on the 17th floor have a ""large furnished terrace"", and you can tell b/c from the 18th floor you can sadly look down at what could have been if you had been assigned a room on the floor below. I called to book again and asked about this and the person on the phone told me there was a table and two chairs on the 18th floor terraces. I was in room 1801 and I assured here that was not the case, and that the room next to me (I think 1804) had a similarly sad small unfurnished ""terrace"", which I knew b/c there was only a hedge separating my non-terrace from their non-terrace. I recognize it's annoying to classify rooms a bunch of different ways, but they should call the 18th floor ""Walker Balcony"" rooms or something that does not indicate a large furnished terrace. I'd consider staying there again but I very much dislike being mislead. So no new bookings for me for now.","Miami Beach, Florida","will_h1234</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami Beach, Florida</strong>",4,3.0

Firstly, it was 45 degrees outside, but ""winter is over so we don't have heat"". Apparently, the thermostat in your room is just a decoy, much like this hotel's advertised location and star rating and the temperature is one size fits all- and same temp throughout the hotel.

The Walker hotel is a well disguised gem in the heart of Greenwich village. The great thing about the location of the hotel is its proximity to 5th Avenue, both the East and West village as well as Union square. One great aspect of the hotel is that it does not look like a hotel and we loved how inconspicuous it was.We found the rooms to be comfortable and cosy. The sizing of which matches the New York norm of being a little on the small side. We found that the rooms had terrible lighting. We struggled with the lack of light in our room. Other than the lighting the room was quaint and comfortable.In regards to the service my mother and I had two entirely different experiences. I found the service to be young, jovial and welcoming. The hotel staff are young and interactive and showed a genuine interest in my experience. I did however find that the door men were never at the door. This was highly frustrating as I had to hail my own taxis or go down to reception ask them to call a door man for me.My mother on the other hand felt that the hotel staff were dismissive of her. When we walked in together the reception always greeted me but never my mother. I was always asked about my excursions but again my mother was ignored. We both found this to be unprofessional especially since it was my mother who was paying for our stay. Ultimately my mother felt that the hotel staff were welcoming of young patrons and that she was not identified with as an older, more established woman and this ultimately took away from the personal experience of her stay.The last comment I have to make is in regard to housekeeping. Our room was not vacuumed once during our stay and it was obvious that our bathroom floor was not mopped or cleaned. Furthermore our toiletries were never replaced which was an irritation.Overall the stay was good. We also tried the restaurant at the hotel which we throughly enjoyed. Ultimately New York has so many wonderful hotels on offer and we have mixed feelings on whether we would stay at the Walker again or try somewhere else.","Johannesburg, South Africa","lil_alexndra</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Johannesburg, South Africa</strong>",1,3.0

Since the Walker is in a residential area I found it to be quiet - away from the sirens and noise of the busier streets. My room was small but since it was only me, it was more than adequate. Two people might have found it to be a little 'cozy' though. The Hotel was very clean and everyone was more than friendly and helpful. They provide free bottles of water daily and treats (cream puffs, macaroons, brownies, etc.) at turn down, which is a nice touch.

The hotel is the smartest in the street with a great deco vibe. The staff were efficient and friendly - we got up-graded to the top floor with a view over downtown and Freedom Towner once we told them it was our honeymoon, plus they had champagne and a chocolate dessert waiting for us - much appreciated touches. Don't know what the traffic noise would be like lower floors, but only sirens penetrated to the 18th. The room is smallish (I think to be expected in NY) but nicely furnished and the bed was VERY comfortable. Only con was controlling the temperature in the room (a bit beyond me) which meant we over-heated a number of times; plus the pelmet stops the windows opening more than 10cm (to stop people throwing themselves out?!) so even getting a breeze was difficult. The foyer is small and nicely furnished and the restaurant is expensive but served one of the better breakfasts we had in NY.

Breakfast was included with our room and it was superb--fresh-pressed juices such as carrot/orange/ginger...amazing. THe staff we interacted with including William, Josh, Adrianne and Brian went out of their way to be helpful but were also very professional and non-intrusive. We felt very comfortable with them.

Instead, I was welcomed by 3 different people within a few minutes, each asking if there was anything they could do to make my stay more enjoyable.

The Walker is a beautiful hotel in central Greenwich Village. It is a small boutique hotel to be sure and rather expensive. The staff are all very pleasant although at times rather absent minded (read on). I reserved the Walker Terrace and when we were shown to our room on the 18th floor we were disappointed. The room was TINY. I have stayed at many upscale hotels in Manhattan but this was ridiculous for the price. The bed is definitely not a queen and less than 18"" from the floor. The ""terrace"" was about two feet deep and the width of the room, approximately 15-20'.I called the front desk and Irving (front desk) was very accommodating. He explained the 17th floor is larger (it turns out about 5' deeper and a full patio with a table and chairs, which is a big difference!) He graciously told us he would move us and to leave the bags in the room and he would have them moved to the new room. We went to have lunch while they cleaned the new room. Upon return the 17th floor room was ready but the bags were beside the front desk even though they assured us they would be moved for us. Instead of waiting, we took the bags up ourselves as they are on wheels. Not a big deal but in the big picture a little annoying.The hotel and rooms are immaculate and house keeping is above par. Beautiful bathroom with a DEEP soaking tub. So big I wanted to swim laps... :-) It is an Art Deco motif and I think very beautifully decorated. You feel like you have transported back to 1925. VERY little space for clothes, a small free standing wardrobe closet is all.The lobby is small but very cozy and a nice place to sit, read the paper and have a cup of coffee. The restaurant is nice with good food but, I am sad to say, incompetent wait staff. We got the couples weekend with breakfast both mornings. The first morning my wife specifically asked for cheddar cheese on her eggs and not only did the waitress forget the cheese and have to bring another serving, she charged for both breakfasts while we were pre-paid. I am the moron that often fails to check the bill but this was hard to miss! The second morning my wife again asked for cheddar cheese and even reminded the waiter a second time and he STILL forgot the cheese. This is not a Waffle House in backwoods Georgia, it is an upscale hotel in Manhattan. I do not like to make a scene and we politely asked for the eggs with cheese and the waiter was appropriately contrite that he had forgotten. The manager (I assume) brought the breakfast Part Deux to the table with apologies. She knew we were leaving and wanted to offer us another free breakfast but gave us two drink vouchers to try and make up for it. The fact she tried is what counted here as were leaving.Over all the hotel staff try to make it right but I believe there is a maturity issue with some of the staff that belies a training issue. I might stay again but would make sure to get he 17th floor and check the wait staff. :-)","Long Island, NY","traveldoc00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, NY</strong>",4,4.0

My expectations were not high because it was a late and last minute booking but the place is so conveniently located with the subway a minute or so away, and other shops and amenities very close by. Initially i was put off by an ugly rug in the middle of the foyer, but in fact the decor was very nice and the room was not only very spacious and clean - the bed is extremely comfortable and I slept better than usual! The place has charming decor - with old fashioned/stylish vibe which makes it feel more like a home than a city central hotel, so it is quite appealing and different from standard modern decor in many NYC hotels. Every day they leave a little free snack in the room. Note that what they call a mini bar , is in fact just snacks and rinks on a tray and there is no fridge. I had several visitors and they all said its a great place. The best things about the hotel are: 1) the restaurant - the food was absolutely delicious, I ate there several times and cannot recommend it highly enough. The restaurant itself is cosy with an open fireplace and skylight. 2) the staff -they are all wonderful and go out of their way to help you at all times, like they would a good friend. There are two African waiters who are absolute gentlemen and so friendly, but I found ALL of the staff very helpful with anything I needed, and nothing seemed to be too much trouble.  I made a costly mistake with my booking as I booked an extra night by mistake, and though i was not entitled to a refund because i realized very late- the hotel honored me with one and took the trouble to contact the booking agent to keep them informed. My 8 night stay was at a very good price. Though it has to be said it was off -peak. I will try this place, next time I'm in NYC as I have stayed at 5or 6 hotels in NYC and this is by far the best in terms of value for money and service.","Lagos, Nigeria","MISSARGY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lagos, Nigeria</strong>",0,4.0

No pastries, refills of hot drinks (the teapot literally only delivers one cup) or even any butter, spreads, jams or jellies.

Plenty of NYT newspapers in the lobby so you could take one and not feel guilty. Coffee in the restaurant ($4 cup) was average in taste. The temperature in the room was hard to adjust but the desk made every effort to address this issue. I would recommend this hotel because location, service and comfort. They will improve the restaurant experience over time but right now it is too expensive and hard to read the menu. It is convenient to the Village and the lobby has so many sofas, chairs, tables and nooks to enjoy. Also a small library. It is right around the corner from Parsons so if you are looking for a smaller hotel with great amenities this is it.","Birmingham, Alabama","traveler308</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",65,4.0

The bar area, doing all kinds of fun, crafty cocktails is separated from the dining room by a low wall and high plants. Just enough to keep the two spaces separate. The dining room is cozy and contemporary, with enough going on to absorb the sounds from other conversations. Nothing worse than dining in NYC and feeling like you can hear the conversations across the room. Not here. The food is bonkers. The menu is made up of small Firsts, pasta-focused Seconds and entree- style Thirds. Try anything and everything. The Hamachi, Burrata, Foie Gras PB&J were standouts. And if gnocchi is on offer, GET IT. You won't be disappointed. Chef has created a farm to table menu that is on another level. Even the cocktail menu features inventive martinis, and wrists on classics, frequently prepared with handmade mixers and local spirits. The wine menu features (good, if not great) NY wines in additon to the Californian and French wines one would expect.

Instead, we found on the desk another necklace that did not belong to me.We informed the reception about what happenened and left the necklace we found, their response after two days has been, we have no evicence of what really happened and you have to take the responsibility of what happened. As a ""courtesy"" if we can say, the hotel offered the return to the airport and one dinner that we had in their restaurant... In any case, this does not compensate the loss of the necklace. The decision taken by the hotel is not commercial at all and legally disputable. 2. We did not find the hotel staff devoted and friendly in spite of what some comments can say. Not professional.3. The rooms very small, dark and not well equiped to put luggage and stuff. Our room was also very badly sound-conditioned.In positive points, the hotel in ideally located and the rooms are actually very clean.In the end, in our view the hotel is over estimated and too expensive for the premises and service you get in return.We do not recommend this hotel.",,ChristelledA,7,1.0

We wanted to stay in the Village and enjoy the many restaurants surrounding this hotel. Also wanted a quieter place that was close to Washington Square but not in a busy thoroughfare. There were breakfast places close by, Murray Bagel just around the corner. The Grey Dog was a few blocks away (0.5 miles ) which was a great menu, hip place and had great coffee. We tried the Restaurant at the hotel, but it was empty, expensive and hard to see the menu without a flashlight. We headed out to a pizza place one night- Ribalta, and Scarpetta another night. Back to the hotel, the front desk - helpful and friendly getting us a quick ride to the airport and tending to our heating problem in our room. It was hard to adjust the thermostat due to the warm weather in New York. Opening the window and the door to the room was somewhat helpful, but the staff were prompt in addressing the heat. The bed-super comfy, sheets- Frette (awesome) toiletries (high quality ) and robe and slippers also provided. How great is that? Plenty of NYT newspapers in the lobby and free water in the room. Now that is unheard of in most NYC hotels. The coffee in the restaurant ($4 a cup was average) I would recommend this hotel because of the comfort of the rooms, although small, but every NYC room is small unless you live in Trump Towers. Who stays long in a hotel room? It has a great location, amenities, and lobby that accommodates many groups of people providing a couple of sofas, chairs, tables and nooks to hang out. I feel they will improve the restaurant experience over time because it is an asset to have the convenience of an in-house place to eat. Maybe a menu with some medium priced items, pizza, burger, sandwiches, soup, nothing fancy just some comfort food to help those who want to stay in for the night but have a satisfying meal without breaking the bank.

The small wardrobe was able to hold 4 jackets and not much more, And to compound the issue there was only room to have one suitcase on a rack.

They were supposed to give us two bottles of water every day but they stopped doing that half way through our stay.There was no room service menu or any information in the room on how to order room service, contact reception, contact housekeeping. It was really strange, I had to ring an outside line to get to reception to ask about room service. They didn't know the extension to room service so they transferred the call and then the room service person read me the menu (while I was calling from my mobile). Our room was right next to the lifts so we got lots and lots of noise.We were suffering from jet lag and wanted to sleep in each morning but the housekeeping staff were VERY noisy in the corridors - letting doors slam ALOT, talking loudly etc..,, it was horrendous.

We are part of the Tablet group which meant that we had free breakfasts as part of our stay. However, the hotel only allows 3 options from the full menu and the serves were very small.

My partner had booked this hotel because it was close to my school and my apartment in NYC. When you arrive it's a wonderful greeting and the hotel has a beautiful entrance, although rather impractical with all the stairs you have to traverse just to get to the lobby. We found it had a wonderful design and in certain areas great care had been taken. The staff was good, but not great, there seemed to be wholes in the service and training. The food and beverage department appeared great. That is until you realized that the 24 hr room service was limited to 5 food items. The room was great until you realize the utility closet is right outside your room and you are privy to hear every housekeeper and maintenance persons movement. The trill of having a terrace to have drinks or breakfast on is diminished when you realize it's barely large enough for two people to turn around on. We did enjoy the wonderful bathroom and the large tub came in very handing for me as I was feeling unwell most of our stay. We loved the menu in the restaurant and bar and the staff was efficient just not what we were expecting at the level of cost and location.

We ended up using a small bench to lay most of the clothes on.We didn't sample the food at the hotel but we did have drinks. The first night we tried to order a drink about 10pm to watch the football in the restaurant (empty) and were told we only do cocktails at this time - I fancied a glass of wine so we didn't bother and went to our room instead. Then as we were getting ready to leave to come home - I asked to order drinks (at about 1pm) and was told the bartender hasn't arrived yet so the waiters couldn't serve it. All a bit bizarre to be honest for reasonable times of the day to ask for a drink. Finally the restaurant hostess sorted it out for us but all we wanted was a wine and beer - nothing fancy.Staff were really pleasant and I was impressed by the doorman who could lift both 20kg cases up the stairs to help us leave.

The building (from the outside) is absolutely 'old-world' charming. Inside is chic and quite beautiful. Yes, it is dark, which took some getting used to, but it is all part of the ambiance which I found to be very unique. Our room, while tiny, was just enough space for our needs. The bed was very comfy. I slept well although our thermostat did not work. The room was overly warm even though the air conditioning was on. The only thing we could do was open the window. The bathroom, (also tiny) was super chic in black, white, and chrome. I appreciated locally made toiletries and super luxurious towels and bathrobe. Our room was never 'made up' even though we were out from 7am until 2:30pm. We left again at 4:30pm and didn't return until 11pm. It seemed curious to me that someone would come and leave coconut macaroons on our night table despite unmade beds and empty coffee cups from our morning coffee service. The room gets much tinier when it is unkempt. I called and mentioned it to the front desk. They didn't seem to have much to say about it but did offer to send up clean towels. I developed laryngitis and wasn't well enough to speak or I would have been much more vocal about the lack of housekeeping service. All in all, I still loved the hotel, the bed, the location, and the overall 'feel' of the place. We had dinner in the new restaurant after our broadway show. The food was incredible and perfectly prepared. They accommodated my special dietary needs graciously and with delicious execution. The wagyu beef was excellent.

But it fell down in a number of areas, which made the experience pretty average.Rooms are small, poorly planned, with very little hanging and storage space for clothes and bathroom stuff. No fridge, no coffee-making facilities, just a messy mix of expensive 'minibar' snacks taking up a lot of room on the small desk. Electrical sockets for hair dryer and chargers in unhelpful positions at floor level, nowhere near a table. The ground floor is being refurbished, so a small reception area doubled as a check-in desk, luggage store, lobby, bar and restaurant, often feeling very crowded.Room cleaning/servicing was erratic and random: some days bottled water was restocked, others not; a cleaner knocked one morning at 7 clutching a black plastic bag, asking for my garbage.The two elevators could not cope with the number of guests - leading to lengthy, frustrating waits for those on higher floors who couldn't take the stairs. Also very frustrating for the cleaning staff who have to use these same elevators for their carts.I was shocked to see large items of trash (filled plastic bags, random litter, sheets of polythene etc) lying around on the service stairs on several floors - and even more shocked when they were all still there, untouched, four days later. These stairs doubled as the fire exits to be used by guests - a real hazard in an emergency.So the stay was a very mixed experience, and the late arrival of our airport transfer booked by the hotel made our departure stressful. Such a shame it didn't live up to its promise.","London, United Kingdom","City_dweller2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",5,3.0

The rooms are wonderful and have everything you need. The location is excellent. There's plenty to do in the immediate area or you can walk anywhere in the city once you've exhausted all there is to do in the village. You are also less than a stone's throw away from subway stations, bus stops and yes, you can even rent a bike at the end of the corner. You have plenty of choices if you want to dine out. Everything from bagel places to pizza places and fine dining establishments. They also have a restaurant behind the lobby.

But, this place has something with a lot of other places just don't have. And a time when I find a lack of customer service almost everywhere you turn, this place is really the exception. Their staff is exceptional!! They all have super dispositions and a smile on their face at all times. We were there over a very, very hot Time during the summer. They could not handle us enough water bottles when we walked in or walk out of the hotel. This, was on top of making sure there was always bottle water in the room! But, they did not have to give water on a hot day to be sincere in their efforts in wanting their patrons to be very happy staying there. They went out of their way to make sure we were very comfortable. On our last day, I was concerned about the weight of one of our pieces of luggage and they even had a luggage scale downstairs and weighed my bag for me. I'm so glad they did, because I was right. It was 3 pounds overweight and I much preferred realigning everything in our luggage in the hotel lobby rather than at the airport terminal. I can't say enough about how friendly the staff is to their patrons. And, it does not appear to be a forced or insincere passing gesture. All in all, it was a great stay. As far as the cost, it is a bit pricey, but then again you are in New York City and it's all relative.

Bathroom with shower was lovely, toiletries were nice, large white soft fluffy towels which were changed every day even though we were happy to keep them, a little sweet treat left in our room during the evening, bottles of water (free) in the room which were replenished daily. The bed was gorgeous, not large but we slept so well. We had a couple of meals in the evening at the hotel which were excellent but skipped breakfast for a local bagel bar. Staff were extremely helpful and knowledgeable and we were ideally located for seeing all the sights New York has to offer. We would definitely go back. Only downside, they started to refurb the bar/restaurant towards the end of our stay but no mention was made of this when we checked in although they are still doing food in the foyer. It's going to take 10 weeks to complete and we'd be interested to see what it's like when it's done. It looked great to us before they ripped it all out!

A splurge, but worth it for the location I wanted. The minute I walked in the door, I was shocked at what I was getting for the rate I was paying.

This really makes me wonder about the veracity of many reviews.Positives: 5 stars for location - outstanding if you want to feel as close to what it might feel like to actually live in NYC/Greenwich Village but still close to great restaurants, bars and subways.5 stars for the bar and the bar staff - a great atmosphere and great service from the barmen.Ambiance - grungy and artistic - I kind of liked this at first but then thought it might be just an excuse for not updating the place. We were there for 11 nights and the dark furniture and paintwork really got me down. Also, it's so dark all through the hotel and in the rooms that visibility is poor, especially on the stairs going down to the bar toilets - be careful. Cleanliness was OK - but dark carpets in common areas and in the lift had the same mess on them for days at a time e.g. there was a cigarette butt on the front stairs in reception for 24 hours - it didn't feel like anyone was in charge of this.Room clean - OK - had to continually ask for toiletries and 'complimentary water ' to be restocked. Reception OK - they accommodated us into a bigger room (smaller bed though) at the front of building for the same price which was appreciated - we knew we couldn't live in the first one we were in for 11 nights as we could couldn't move around the furniture and suitcases.The rooms were very quiet and the beds were comfortable but the mattresses sit on a slab of timber that we were constantly walking into - pretty badly bruised on the shins by the time we left - watch out for this too.Invoicing - we left early one morning at 6am and were told the computer was down so they'd email an invoice to us. Didn't receive it so a week or so later messaged them through trip advisor - no reply. Emailed them directly another week or so later - no reply. Finally rang them because our credit card number was being used illegally in the US and I wanted to check the hotel account - on the phone for about 10 minutes while they found it (racking up a phone bill). They emailed it and I found we'd been charged for a breakfast and room service drinks that we didn't order. This was a pain because if we'd received it on departure we could have raised it with the hotel. It was probably an innocent error but for US$35 or so it wasn't worth the effort of trying to get it corrected.I'm heading back to New York with another family in January 2017 for a week but I won't be revisiting the Walker Hotel in Greenwich Village.","Sydney, Australia","helfromoz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",13,3.0

We came upon the Walker [back when it was called the Jade] and made our reservations 10 months in advance as we wanted to be sure to snag one of the Barrow Queen rooms. For the price and the space, a Barrow Queen at the Walker offers tremendous value in NYC. We had not only the Queen bed, but also a separate sitting area with two leather chairs and a table that we could use for breakfast. And then there was the bay window which had its own cushioned bench. The extra space comes in handy for extra storage because the closet is on the small side.You know what they say in real estate: LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION.

From those 2, you can get almost anywhere you want in the City. It's also a great neighborhood just to walk around in and explore.Others have commented on noise. Occasionally we would hear doors close, but it never kept us awake or awakened us. There's a nice bar in the lobby that came in handy on some of the warmer days for a cool late afternoon drink. There's also a Murray's Bagels just around the corner on 6th if you want a quick [and cheap] breakfast.We really loved our stay and will definitely consider coming back on our next trip.A few quick odds & ends:--Great HDTV with extensive channel selection.--Turndown service was hit and miss.--Some days we got our two bottles of water, some days not.--If you are staying during the summer, you might want to request they change out the heavier duvet cover for a lighter summer blanket.

The Walker hotel is no exception. unfortunately, despite being newly built 3 years ago in a style that makes you think it is original art deco, it has all the drawbacks without any of the advantages. The furniture is tacky, the utilities don't work properly, the staff is friendly but unhelpful, the hotel lacks but the most basic facilities. Much promise but little delivery. Unfortunate, as it promises more than it delivers. Compromises were obviously made in producing a ""chic"" 18 story hotel out of two townhouses: endless waits for the elevator, claustrophobic narrow passages, non functioning air conditioners, showers that overflow. If they were balanced out by something positive apart from the good, but not great, location, then it'd be worth more than 3 stars. At the price, 2 may have been more appropriate, but this is New York and you take what you can get.","Munich, Germany","TomS841</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich, Germany</strong>",98,3.0

First, to get to the lobby there's a big flight of stairs. You can take the luggage elevator which is right by the front door so don't freak out when you arrive and think that you're going to be trotting up this staircase morning noon and nightSecond, the rooms are very cleverly decorated but TINY, especially for the price (even by New York standards). I was travelling alone so it wasn't a big deal but if I'd brought my husband along I'm not sure where I would have put him. They are also flawed. For one thing there is no clock in the room. I know it doesn't sound like a big thing but it drove me crazy. They also have a ""minibar"" which consists of a basket of stuff that takes up a third of the already minimal desk space which has decorative drawers that don't open, The drawers of the desk in my room were purely decorative, i.e., they didn't open so there was no place to put stuff when I was working and bizarrely there is also nothing in the room with the hotel address on it and no instructions about how to make phone calls.That said, my bathroom was enormous with a huge deep tub and a fabulous walk-in shower. Just glorious. So, bottom line, would I stay there again? Yes, but then again my daughter lives two blocks away so the location is perfect. Would I recommend it to a friend? I don't think so.

Hotel staff were lovely and very helpful & friendly. Had drinks in the bar a couple of times, it's a lovely area and staff again very friendly. And the beds were so comfy (tho it could be we were so tired lol) no honestly they were fab beds.The only thing I can say in a negative way about the hotels is there is no storage space, I can only think a man did the interior decorating as no woman would ever think that a wardrobe with a rail going half way through the wardrobe would be a good idea!! PLEASE change this. Also the desk in the room dump it and put some drawers in the room. We had a Bedford double which is obviously a room for friends travelling together so why is there a desk, a weirdly designed wardrobe and 3 tiny drawers? Also the bedside table was taken up by a huge lamp & telephone. No storage at all. I did know from reading other reviews that this would be the case but hoped it wouldn't be as bad. We were staying for a week and we struggled. BUT it didn't detract from this fabulous hotel and if and when I come back to New York I would stay here again.

I hope management sees how great they are! It was unfortunate that there was an old guy there complaining about everything.. (his decaf coffee had a few bubbles on the top and insisted it wasn't decaf, then his omelet was flipped correctly, etc etc, berating the server) yet the server was delightful the entire time and tried over and over to help this guy. He was attentive, polite and kept composure even under a stressful situation out of his control. The fruit was sweet, the coffee was delicious, and the avocado toast fresh. Can't complain about anything. The only thing I can say is that I found a significantly (hundreds) cheaper rate online compared to calling and asking for a good rate. I wish that a charming hotel like this would be able to provide better service with making a reservation at a good price without having to go to other booking websites. In addition, I never noticed the doorman that was suppose to be 24/hours.

You enter and walk down steps into a romantic, dark and luxe reception area. The bar and restaurant serve delicious food and drinks and room service prices are not bad. The rooms are on the small side, but have lovely linens, a great shower with subway tiles, marble, etc. Nice little perks like free Frette slippers, Saratoga water and Bigelow products. We've dinged them one star for the quirky and rather confused service. Everyone was nice and helpful, quick but there were numerous missteps. Room service breakfast was delivered missing the coffee, and a promise to deduct the coffee never appeared. A doorman knocked on everyone's door asking if we had a ""rotary or touch"" phone...really disturbing everyone for no reason. Another doorman came to our door to take our luggage and we had not made a request - confused with someone else, then a follow up call again disturbing us...asking if we had or had not requested someone to come and get luggage. We left an empty tissue container and lotion bottle signaling that we needed more since we had to call to front desk the previous day, and the empty box and bottle were put back on the shelf with no replacements...and no washcloths either. We took to leaving notes for the maid to replace things so we didn't have to call to the front desk. On the plus side, the bartender made a spectacular margarita that was very specific to my request, and all of the various hotel services were quick. So, a lovely lovely place, but their well-intentioned service could use some work.","Santa Fe, New Mexico","Diane D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Fe, New Mexico</strong>",8,4.0

We could walk anywhere, or conveniently eat downstairs. The hotel is across from the our son's school, making it quite convenient to attend his performances. Bed was comfortable, and hotel staff was very welcoming and most important to me - not stuffy - they seemed happy to relate to the guest, and we found that above all most impressive. I give this hotel a 4 out of 5 rating only due to these 2 minor issues- 1)The breakfast staff is slow, though the menu is a choice of 4 possibilities. Food was good, but not at all complicated enough for the slow service...especially for coffee service and ordering. On our last day, there were 2-3 servers, but they seemed way too overwhelmed and took forever to even bring us coffee or take our order. 2 tables on either side of us were very frustrated. I didn't understand, as the breakfast menu is not complicated (only 4 possibilities, and 3 are combination of basic toast with a combination of avacado+ poached egg )or salmon atop), and side of a potato like latke + mixed greens, or a pancake order). and shouldn't have affected the wait staff in being inattentive for coffee or refills. 2.) While it is nice to have the bed turned down for you early evening, often we'd been out all day and returned exhausted and desperately needing nap only to be bothered by a knock every.single.evening/time.just as we were nodding off.

Wanting to be in the heart of the Village, but not on a loud block, The Jade was perfect. Situated on W13th between 5th and 6th Avenues (aka Ave of the Americas), the block is quiet but also just around the corner from stores, restaurants, and cafes. Washington Sq Park and Union Sq are only a few blocks away, providing for ample access routes to many subways to the rest of Manhattan and beyond. Seeing as it was a special weekend, I reserved the Greenwich Penthouse Room, which offered amazing, unfettered views uptown, including the Empire State Building from our own private terrace. If it wasn't windy and 35-degrees Fahrenheit, we might have spent our entire stay taking in the view from the terrace or from the giant soaking tub with the same views as from the terrace. It just doesn't get more romantic. From check-in to check-out and all points in between, the staff were friendly, amenable, and even wished us a Happy Anniversary upon arrival and later sent us a complimentary bottle of champagne to the room. Just perfect. A week after staying at The Jade, I received an email that the name was changing to The Walker. I'm unsure if the management was changing hands or had already done so, but nevertheless, our stay was excellent. Many thanks to the hotel staff for making a special weekend all the better!

It was very roomy and the bathroom was nice too. The water pressure was amazing. It is a weird thing I have about places I stay. I am picky about the water pressure and how quickly the sink drains.

The hotel's location on W. 13th was perfect for our needs and when we saw the photos on the website, we were hooked! From the lobby to the bar, the restaurant to the rooms, the art deco theme throughout the hotel is stylish and classic. We were warmly greeted upon our arrival by Brian, who helped us with our bags. The check-in experience was very pleasant. Every staff person we met was congenial and expressed interest in the comfort of our stay. We stayed 3 nights, and every time we saw Brian, he inquired about our daily experiences. He provided very helpful information about the area. Our room was on the 12th floor with a beautiful view of the Empire State Building. We found the one queen room to be spacious for a NYC boutique hotel room. It was quiet and there was plenty of light. Our room was made up each day and the beds were turned down each night with a piece of chocolate on the pillows. There are only 2 elevators and they tend to be slow, so allow time for a wait, especially in the mornings. We ate breakfast in the hotel restaurant each morning and enjoyed the decor as well as the impeccable service. The attractive lobby with the warm fireplace was a welcome sight each time we returned from our sight-seeing. We had a late afternoon flight out on our departure date, so the hotel staff was gracious enough to store our luggage. They even offered to have a cab ready for us that afternoon. There was a mix-up with our luggage and another guests' luggage and the transportation to the airport, resulting in the necessity of our taking a more expensive mode of transportation than we had requested. When we arrived at the airport and called the hotel, they not only agreed to refund our credit card the difference, they credited us the amount of the entire ride!

The rooms are small, but nicely decorated and furnished in an Art Deco style. When we checked in, our room was warm, around 74 degrees and when I switched the thermostat to cool, the setting was already down to around 60, but warm air was only blowing out. I know that some hotels switch to heat only in the winter and I thought this must have been the case, so I thought no big deal- I'll open a window and turn on the fan to drown out the noise and we will deal with it. However, the fan on the on setting only blew out warm air also and soon the room was at 77 degrees. As it was late and my wife was already in bed, I did not wish to call the front desk and have an engineer come in, so we left the Windows open, but because of our proximity to 6th avenue and the foot traffic , it was pretty noisy all night and the room never cooled off that much. Needless to say, we did not sleep well.The next morning, I immediately reported the problem to the front desk and the front desk person said he would report the problem to engineering. As I sat in the lobby drinking my coffee that morning, at least 2 other guests complained about the same issue and were told by another front desk worker that the problem was that the system was in heat only mode, but that engineering would be making an adjustment that day. Temperatures were expected to rise to the upper 50's that weekend. Don't they pay attention to the same weather reports we do?Anyway, when we returned back to our room late that afternoon , it was obvious that nothing had changed with the heat situation, so I reported that to the front desk and she apologized for ""our inconvenience"" and suggested we turn the system to off and the fan to auto and somehow this was supposed to moderate the room temperature . Huh? Shortly thereafter an engineer knocked on the door and flipped the setting to cool and said that the room would cool down. I felt the warm air coming out of the vent and told him I don't think so. He was pretty short, so he put his hand on the return in the hall ceiling and said feel this, it's not hot. I had to explain to him that he was feeling air being sucked into the return . That's where the warm air enters the cooling system . I had him stretch to feel the warm air being expelled from the vents and he still insisted we let the system run and the room would cool down. Ok, right. An hour later, and the temp rose from 73 to 75. I marched down to the front desk and asked if we could try another room . I once again explained what we went through the previous night and again was told ""sorry for your inconvenience"". I explained that I consider this much more than a mere ""inconvenience"" . I would consider not having your room serviced an inconvenience . This was much worse. I paid for something I did not receive- a good nights sleep. She was helpful and took me to a room on a lower floor. And immediately upon entering it was much more comfortable temperature wise. It was a handicap accessible room which was larger. The only down side was the whole bathroom was basically open with only a curtain separating the shower, but there was cool air coming from the vents and my wife and I slept like babies. Only an OK place, probably will avoid in the future.

Extremely professional service on the front desk from check in, to answering queries and check out. The vibe of the hotel is magnificent. Truly art deco, very comfortable and very cool. Loved all the old photos in the bar/restaurant which reflected stars who used to hang out in the area (Andy Warhol for example). We also had, in passing, mentioned in our contact with the hotel before arriving that we were coming back to NY to celebrate our first year of marriage - for which we came from Australia to NY to do in 2014. On New Years Eve we received a lovely complimentary bottle of champagne to celebrate this occasion. Such a kind and lovely gesture. Only very minor issues - firstly - no tea and coffee facilities or mini bar (I find this common in US hotels). You have to pay for tea and coffee which we find a little unusual (most hotels we've stayed in around the world offer this complimentary and god knows when you're traveling a good cuppa is super important!!) and the rooms, although beautiful and true to the art deco character, were really dimly lit. I understand this may be to keep to the theming of the hotel but at times it was a bit ridiculous. An extra light in the room would be beneficial.But really these are minor things - the rooms were exceptional clean, extremely comfortable and quite spacious by NYC standards. The bed was super comfy, the shower had awesome power and heat and the complimentary bathroom products were beautiful. We also had a room with a balcony which was a lovely touch.

Only issue we found was the window open and latch broken upon check in, but Engineering was responsive and had it resolved in 30 mins or less. Room had a lot to offer, nice details and extra touches. Room service was very quick and food was delicious! For dessert I had ordered a peanut butter cheese cake but brought a regular cheesecake with a yellow sauce, was not good at all (but was not upset as I probably didn't need dessert anyways).

The staff were absolutely fantastic and helped make our stay wonderful and totally unforgettable. The hotel is beautifully designed and maintained and must have been recently renovated - its stunning from the outside too. The lobby and rooms have lovely designed touches and the large shower is impossible to leave once you turn it on. We never had the chance to dine in the good sized restaurent but it looked really cool - as did the bar.

We had stayed previously at the Trump Soho, but never again due to our principles. Trip Advisor showed me the Jade Hotel (not to be confused with the Jane Hotel! I learned you have to give an address to the taxi drive or end up in the wrong place!). I booked it because the reviews were good, and the price was right for a boutique hotel. I am always a little leery of boutique hotels because of little things like bed squeaks and room service options that might not be right for us, but I went ahead and booked the family (5 all together) 3 rooms for three nights to try it out. I was pleasantly surprised. I fell in love with this hotel for several reasons. The location can't be beat. It is very central and walking distance to so many great restaurants, shopping... Union Square, Washington square Park, Village and Soho. The hotel staff were ALL very nice. I asked for names, but there were too many to remember and list! From check in to check out, each person was wonderful. They weren't just courteous, they were really nice... the front desk, the bellman, room service, housekeeping, and bartenders! That makes such a difference! The hotel is fairly new, so everything was very nice. It seems they spared no experience in the materials used to build and decorate. The rooms were spacious for NYC standards. All were nicely decorated, red/black exposed brick, tastefully vintage. The views from all of our rooms were great. The Empire State Bldg. views from our room on one side and the Freedom Tower view from my kid's rooms on the other side of the building. The bathrooms were clean, new and beautiful, marble and tile work floors and showers. The water pressure was great! The beds were comfortable, the sheets were fine, seemed new, they weren't luxurious, but weren't scratchy or bleach smelling, the towels were soft. Room service was very prompt. I loved the Grape & Vine Restaurant/Bar off the lobby. It was charming, quiet, great lighting, red velvet booths, exposed brick, beautiful tin ceiling, just the right ambience, with nice staff. I would like to say there is nothing wrong with this hotel. However, I will give a balanced review and say there was minimal that might cause a concern depending on what someone expects... such as, there was no minibar refrigerator, just a snack basket, and no ice machine, but 24 hour room service will bring ice up to you very promptly. The walls were a little thin, so you could hear everything in the hall, but our hallway was quiet as there are only about 5 rooms on a floor, so this didn't really bother us. I would recommend the higher floors for a better view. The penthouse is a bit more spacious, has an outdoor balcony area with views, and the bathroom has a very nice tub, but minimal counter space for makeup, etc. There is a magnifying mirror (not lighted). Also, sometimes the elevators can take a bit of time (not too bad), but only if you hit it at the wrong time - check in or check out. These are such minor things, that this place scored big with us, and we will be back. I almost didn't want to share this review for fear that once people become aware of this gem, it will become so popular that availability would be an issue.","Laguna Beach, California","SoCalGirl37</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laguna Beach, California</strong>",29,5.0

Not only is the hotel smaller and more quaint than the others I've stayed in during past visits, but the staff make you feel like you're their most important guest and make sure all your needs are met and then some. We loved everything about this hotel, from the cozy lobby with the seating area around the fire (where they will also serve you food and drinks) to the excellent bar and restaurant in the back, to our hotel room with the view of One World Trade Center. The room was small and if I could change anything it would have been to add just a few more square feet so there is somewhere to sit other than on the beds, however, with the great lobby to relax in, it was less of an issue.

We expected small rooms--this is a boutique hotel in Greenwich Village, and we wanted character. The art deco vibe is very tastefully done, and the restaurant on-site is gorgeous, if slightly overpriced. Our room was street-side but there was no street noise at all. Now, this is an older building, so there are issues to be expected. I mentioned the small room, and this did not bother us, but be aware that storage for big bags in the room is non-existent other than a small wardrobe. The free in-room wifi was very slow to connect and connections dropped frequently. Our room had some plumbing issues--the shower was very slow to drain and the toilet was sometimes reluctant to flush completely, and the hot water was ENTIRELY too hot--as in scalding hot--and the shower controls were very temperamental. Also the walls are very thin, as they often are in old buildings--we could hear our neighbors having a very romantic time late, late into the night. No big deal, but a little soundproofing would go a long way. The biggest issue for us was the thermostat in the room, which we set to 70 and put on ""cool,"" but which continually blew out warm-to-hot air. Our room was frequently stifiling--remedied by opening the window, but certainly not ideal. We would consider staying again, but I'm not sure the price matches the quality and/or the amenities.

Thus restored my faith in people and instantly turned a miserable stay into an exciting holiday. I was able to appreciate the interesting decor, old styles radio and Telephone.

Decided to go with Greenwich penthouse room. I think you probably pay $100 more per night for a great bathroom and view (no problem with this)Rooms are not huge. But big enough for a 3 night stay. I will suggest to hotel that they put a little more storage in by way of hooks ( wall by door/ side of wardrobe/ bathroom) (nowhere to hang big jackets for example ) easy fix. Also a small table in bathroom would be useful.Nowhere to put cases in room/ designers should have spec'd beds with storage under ;) (guess you could store empty cases on balcony or in luggage storage) Bathtub fills super quickly and its massive! Shower is really powerful. Housekeeping should have topped up bathroom products a bit more.Beds are super comfy. Sheets/ pillows/ duvet - lovely. Towels fluffy.Radio in room is great so you can have some entertainment without TV on.Lift is fast. Bar is relaxed- and good happy hour. Staff have been super friendly and accommodating. A credit to the hotel.Location is great. Pretty easy to walk where ever from hotel. Only one thing I have noticed would could be annoying is I think Maintenance or staff rooms are on top floor so a few times I heard chatter early in morning and doors or radios - staff shouldProbably bear in mind people are chilling/ sleeping.Slept with door to balcony open. It was not too noisy at all and loved hearing the sounds of the city.Overall. I felt looked after. Happy with stay and would choose the jade again.(Ps. If Art Deco isn't your style, it's not overload, more accents in room so don't let that put you off of the rooms)Ohhhhh and go to Murray's bagels just around the block!",ukpartygirl,"ukpartygirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>ukpartygirl</strong>",5,4.0

They told me its mosquitos even though every time you get in the bed its itchy. I was prepared to stay with them recently, just expecting they would deal with the pest, but they ignored my reservation requests.

Otherwise there are plenty of subways within walking distance to catch.The decor is lovely and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. We were welcomed with a complimentary bottle of gin in out room along with the tonic water and limes which added a nice touch to our visit. Also on most evenings there would be treats left on our pillows which was lovely.The bar is fairly small but great for pre dinner drinks. This is linked to the restaurant which serves a fab brunch menu. I could really recommend the eggs florentine and the orange juice. Yum!There is a gym in the basement which is small but pretty much has all you need to work of all the calories consumed whilst on yout visit to NYC.I cannot remember any staff names unfortunately but everyone was great. However on a few occasions the staff went out there way to recommend local restaurants to eat, printed off the directions and also went out to the street to grab us a taxi.

As someone who travels to NYC several times a year, I keep looking for the right hotel. I like boutique hotels for that unique style. I also try to avoid the boutique hotels that cater to the young, party scene (aka pretentious douchbags and the ""bridge & tunnel"" crowd). I always stay below midtown since my NYC experiences tend to entail exploring the West Village, Tribeca, Soho, Chelsea, etc. If you have been disappointed by the ""too cool for school"" attitude of places like the Standard Highline and don't want to stay somewhere where the hotel bar is over crowded or subject to lines and velvet ropes - again, this is your kind of hotel. The location is phenomenal for roaming the city (a short block from 14th & 6th and the subway). The small bar area is excellent - comfy sofas, tables and chair in a stylish cocktail setting - for excellent cocktails in a quiet setting with free wifi. I completely understand why the bar has been listed as one of this city's hottest and best cocktail bars; I am also grateful that the trenders have moved elsewhere and left this amazing lounge free of crowds.The room was great. My room was actually a handicap room - it was thus quite spacious for a NYC hotel. Also note, but for the penthouses, the rooms have what I call a European style bathroom - i.e., no bathtub but a shower that is essentially not separated from the rest of the bathroom. I understand that most rooms have a partial glass wall and lip on the floor to prevent flooding the whole bathroom. In my handicap room (NB: I am not disabled and did not ask for this room but enjoyed the space.), there was no partial wall or lip on the floor - just a shower curtain. All that said - this style of bathroom does not bother me. I am used to them in my travels in Europe. I know that some Americans are not used to them and do not like them. So - while it does not bother me - it may bother others. The wifi in the room was decent (I never find any hotels have great wifi) for using your phone or devices. The rooms included free bottled water, a safe, an iron (& board). The room service was 24 hours. And the staff was friendly and helpful. The turndown service (tasty gourmet cookie included) was a nice added touch. The doors may be a little thin so don't expect complete silence. Fortunately, I am a heavy sleeper and these issues do not concern me. Finally, the room prices are well below many other (inferior) boutique hotels. There is no doubt where I will stay on my next visit to NYC. But shhhh - let's keep this place a secret.","Toronto, Canada","Xmtler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",69,5.0

We stayed in the Greenwich Penthouse suite on the 17th floor - while the room was rather smaller than we expected (as a penthouse suite, it was smaller than some standard hotel rooms I have stayed in!) the view of the Empire State Building was priceless. The bathroom was a great size, with a deep luxurious bath and a great shower.All the staff were very courteous and polite and we received nothing but great service from them. The food we had was delicious and, when ordered as room service, arrived very promptly,However, there were a few slight annoyances with the Jade Hotel. Firstly, there was NO minibar in the room. They provided fresh bottled water each day, but, in New York in the middle of summer, all this meant was warm water when we returned to our hotel room. There were no ice machines available either. I'm sure I could have asked room service for some ice, but this was not something I wanted to do each time I wanted a drink.Secondly, there was no coffee machine in the room. If you wanted coffee, you'd have to order it from room service - like the mini bar, a bizarre oversight. There were also slight irregularities in room service. Our complimentary shower gels and bath salts, which were so heavily promoted on the website, were never replaced. Twice housekeeping removed our dirty water glasses but didn't replace them with clean ones and sometimes housekeeping left a single complimentary biscuit on the bed, sometimes two, sometimes none. It was irregularities like these that gave the impression that, as a new hotel, the Jade is still finding it's feet.I would still recommend coming here - the location is great, the staff are fantastic and the decor of the hotel was wonderful. However, I have never stayed at at hotel (even cheap ones!) that have not provided a mini bar/fridge or coffee making facilities.

No breakfast included.I had heard that New Yorkers are brusque and rude. So I was so surprised to be met by a very nice bellman who carried my suitcase down the staircase to the lobby (pity the lobby is not at street level) and by the very sweet staff at the reception desk.The staff in the restaurant were also wonderful and we had a delicious dinner on our first night (it was pouring with rain and we were reluctant to get soaked looking for a restaurant in the neighbourhood). The atmosphere was romantic and the service excellent. Pricey though -- $100 for two vegetarians!Our room for the rate we had booked was exceptionally tiny! Literally just walking space around the bed, not even space to put your suitcase. Because we were staying a full week we asked for an upgrade and were graciously given one! The new room was spacious, can you believe it in New York City?! And it also had a nice view with the One World Trade Center in the distance.The block-out curtains were amazing and we had a pitch dark room at night giving very good sleep. But the mattress was so soft that by the end of the week I had terrible backache. The mattress is also foam so it was very hot. I asked the hotel staff if the mattress could be changed but was told they were standard mattresses throughout. We had 11 nights in NYC and spent our final 4 nights at The Marlton where the very firm mattress thankfully returned my back to normal. The bathroom was spacious and the shower very powerful! The room was well insulated from outside noise, very quiet, but you can hear people in the passage or when another room door is closed -- it makes a very loud click. One weird thing: the bottom sheet on the bed doesn't reach all the way to the foot of the bed! So it would crumple up during the night, not comfortable. It took three requests to get a sheet that would actually fit the mattress, and even then it barely did.The hotel location is on the edge of Greenwich Village -- I wouldn't say it is IN the Village. There were about three supermarkets and plenty of fast-food joints just outside the closest subway station which was several blocks away from the hotel, and this didn't make for a pleasant walk back to the hotel, especially at night/early hours.When we were deciding where to stay, it was a choice between The Marlton or The Jade. We hedged our bets and stayed in both over the 11 nights we were in NYC. In retrospect, I would make a hotel choice based on proximity to a subway station, ie no more than one or two blocks away, because invariably you will be travelling up and down the island each day. After a very long tiring day the last thing I felt like doing was walking several blocks to a place where I'd sleep (we hardly spent any time in the hotel). But if you are choosing a hotel specifically for Greenwich Village, then The Marlton is better located because it is so much closer to vibey streets and cafes.All in all The Jade is a very good hotel: trendy, spacious bathroom with powerful shower, well appointed rooms, excellent restaurant, sweet staff. Pity the mattress lets them down.","Cape Town Central, South Africa","Traveller123CT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cape Town Central, South Africa</strong>",65,4.0

The showers nice except the door was only a half glass wall so it was awkward and wet but we were told those are being steadily replaced (about half the hotel had been changed). The staff were helpful and nice; although I reported the phone didn't work and the loud bathroom fan was constantly running and no one came to investigate as far as I know.

I wanted this to be ""my hotel"" in the city. I may go back but not likely and with much altered expectations. I appreciate good service and it began with none. There was no doorman in site so it was confusing on where to go with your luggage - debating whether to navigate the staircase or the side elevator. Once finding the front desk off to the side, again there wasn't much help. The person there didn't know how to check me in and finally someone emerged from behind the curtain still eating, while the other was playing on their phone. Trust me, I'm not a complainer, but after a long day traveling I just wanted to get to my room. The room looked very much like their marketing photos and I expected a tiny closet/wardrobe based on other reviews, but boy was it tiny. I asked the bellboy for extra hangers (more than the 4/5 stocked there) and it seemed to be no problem, though they never arrived. There were very nice touches like cookies & treats with a beautiful note on nice stationery, and bottles of water.I paid a fair amount more to have an outside terrace that was entirely disappointing. My trip was the end of May so there was no reason temperature wise to not love it, but there were cigarette butts in the paver cracks and the wall of ivy/plantings that you see in their photos was a wall of dead leaves. Just really bad first impressions overall. And I'm afraid to say it continued. It isn't on a major street, though close to the corner to find a cab, but I do appreciate the services of a doorman for this reason and probably 8 out of 10 times, he was missing. I came to rely on UBER, thankfully, and of course then the doorman would show up. The frustration was more that the staff seemed constantly texting or talking to one another than helping the guests. I'm young-ish, I get it, but I also paid and chose this hotel for a reason. My previous stay was at The Dream Downtown, and their service was exceptional, and yes I compared it the entire time, but I was looking forward to a more intimate experience.The room service from their restaurant Grape & Vine was wonderful! It's not a large menu, which I thing is a good thing, and everything I tried was delicious.As I said there is a chance I will go back, but if so at a base price room, which I expect to be quite small, as this room was without the terrace, and have UBER ready at all times.","Akron, Ohio","Liz S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Akron, Ohio</strong>",2,3.0

Tucked into a nondescript block between 5th & 6th Avenue, its impressive and highly-stylized exterior suggest the great look and feel within. The lobby does not disappoint. While not big, it feels as though you've stepped down into a very chic west village brownstone. Like being in someone's fabulous living room. Rich colors, comfortable sofas, nooks and alcoves filled with books. Extremely well done. Through the lobby is the hotel's restaurant and pocket bar, again so beautifully decorated with exposed brick, velvet booths, a beaux-arts looking skylight that lets lots of light through, and wonderful light fixtures. Rooms have the same comfortable, dark exteriors - maybe a bit too dark for a hotel room - but high-style, all the same. OK - breaking it down to pros and cons...Pros - the vibe and the staff. We ate at the restaurant every morning and generally had a cocktail or glass of wine at the bar before or after heading out to dinner. The bar & restaurant staff have got to be the hardest working team. Always so polite and helpful. Bartenders lots of fun, making you feel very welcome, and offered us some excellent tips on restaurants. Tho sometimes difficult to get a seat at the bar – best to go early or later. Another pro is the location - for shoppers - 5th Avenue between 15th & 21st has pretty much everything you need - from Anthropologie to Sephora to Banana Republic and J Crew. Heading the other direction, or left out of the hotel, you are just a few blocks away from the meat packing district with its cool designer shops and restaurants and the hi-line. My husband was staying at the hotel for about 9 nights on business, so the hotel gave him a larger version of the entry category room – the Grove Queen. Facing onto 13th street, our room had a little sitting area, which made it feel pretty spacious. However – in keeping with the rich and dark style of the hotel, the rooms are dark. Very moody, but not maybe as practical as you’d want. Which leads me to the Cons – no mini bar or mini fridge in the room. And no coffee maker. Yes – there are delis around the corner where you can nip out and grab a coffee and bagel, and yes, you can pop downstairs into the restaurant and grab one, but sometimes you just want to stay in your PJs. Another con about the rooms – poor closet organization. Like IKEA with the bars that pull out, rather than run side to side. Not only can you not fit anything in, but what does fit on a hanger can’t be seen. And minimal drawer space, as well. Bathrooms small but well-designed and easily manageable. Maid service, as I have found pretty much everywhere, is spotty. Sometimes they’ll take those dirty wine glasses; sometimes not.Bottom line – if you are looking for style and comfort in Greenwich Village – this is the property for you.","Paris, France","Battered Orange S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",105,4.0

This was probably my 15th trip to the city. We had never stayed at The Jade before but liked the pictures that we saw online. It did not disappoint. The hotel is beautiful. It's not in a touristy district at all and made us feel like we were much more ""hip"" and local than we actually are. That might sound a little intimidating but it was the opposite. We felt very included. Little details, like the fire in the lobby to the flowers to the actual rotary phones in the room, were fantastic. The staff were very friendly and helpful, even going so far as to look for a lint roller for my daughter, who had somehow gotten fuzz all over her jacket.The room itself was gorgeous. The colors and bedding were luxurious. The view was exceptional. The bathroom was lovely with subway tile and very nice fixtures. The rooms weren't overly large - but I've never stayed in a NYC hotel with huge rooms. I only mention that for people who might not be aware of that.There's a bagel shop just around the corner, and this is within comfortable walking distance of one of my favorite restaurants - Tea and Sympathy. It's a short walk to the subway, but the staff is always helpful and willing to get a taxi for you. In short, I would definitely recommend this for anyone visiting New York.

I had a very long flight and decided to have a quick dinner at the hotel - and that was a big mistake. I was parked in the lobby to eat (I guess the algorithm is that you should not waste a restaurant table on a single guest), and forgotten there without a menu for a very long while. Then a menu arrived... but it was the brunch one, not the dinner one, and took another 20-30 to attract the waiter's attention and ask for the correct menu. Getting the blond waiter to come to take the order was also a very lengthy process (and she was clearly not very busy). Similarly, I never managed to get a drink for my meal: by the time the waiter on ""duty"" (sounds like an euphemism) came to my table, I was done with the food and had no use of a glass of wine anymore, and never managed to get some water either. Baseline: I tried to have a quick dinner there, and it took only 2 hours and 45 minutes to get a cocktail and one dish, and no water nor wine for my meal - I could have used a dessert too, but I was not ready to wait until the morning after for the waiter to pay attention.I left very unhappy (even left a note - with a tip - on the credit card payment slip), and in the next 5 days there I never used the restaurant again (once, coming back after a very long day, I decided to rather order food to my room). The location is great, but since they are not the only ones well placed and it is not the cheapest option out there, I don't see why one should go there for being treated like that by the restaurant staff: I clearly won't be back.I understand that waiters, being probably on minimum wage, have stronger incentives to pay attention to tables with many customers (rather than a table with only one person) to make a living out of tips, but the all experience was really beyond rude.","London, United Kingdom","Chris J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",15,2.0

Décor, ambiance, and lighting all really work in what we consider an ideal West Village location. Add to this, there is easy access via taxi or subway to all the rest of Manhattan. Not to forget that absolute essential: a great staff. (One of them, Briant, was drafted in by the management to help me learn to work a tricky app. how nice is that?) Not to mention that the hotel restaurant, The Grape & Vine, which also has a street entrance, is way better than average and so attractive that it's obviously popular with the locals, as well. In short, we'd go back to the hotel tomorrow. Any minuses? Of course. What's perfect? You may be disappointed if you need a huge room (we don't). Or a bath (we don't) instead of a shower (not all rooms have baths). With the one thing we'd really change being to turn down the volume on the restaurant music at night. (Is this generational? Surely not!) Two further extras: just a few doors up the street is a great little indie cinema: The Quad Cinema.

The doorman and his red umbrellas are a very nice enhancement to the experience and to the neighborhood.

This is a nice tree-lined residential Greenwich Village neighborhood that has a serious lack of hotels so this new hotel is a well-needed addition, and the rates are competitive. It has only been here about 3 years and the restaurant & bar have caught on with the locals and have a nice downtown vibe. You should leave the car home. There is very little good parking around here. This block (13th Street between 5th and 6th Ave.’s) used to be the truck entrances for all the businesses on 14th Street so that is why it is zoned for truck traffic and there is no parking during the day. With that said, the block has also had something of a renaissance in the past several years and all the truck bays are replaced by boutiques, schools and their dorms (New School and Parsons), restaurants and this hotel. There is also an independent Film Theater on the block and several other schools (much of NYU) all around in every direction. Union Square and Washington Square Park are within walking distance, as well as most of the Village and the Meat Packing District. Buses and most of the subways that link you to the entire city are also within walking distance.

I loved the Art Deco decor and the quirky little touches like the rotary phone, and window seat. Also - cookies at turn down were a nice touch. I agree that a mini bar and tea/coffee facilities would have been useful - there was easily enough space between the bed and the window to fit something in.

Everything from suggestions for restaurants, making reservations, and giving directions was graciously given. The lobby area and bar are cozy with places to be in the midst of it all or to hide away for a little privacy. Happy hour with half off on wines by the glass and flatbread pizzas was a must.The only downside was space. Our family of 5 stayed in two ""double"" rooms (i.e., 2 beds in the room). The decor is wonderful, but the double rooms feel very small, especially for an extended stay with a few pieces of luggage. Hardly enough space to pull out the chair and sit at the desk. Our Aunt and Uncle stayed in a ""queen"" room, which did have a bit more space (same sq.ft. but one less bed), but still only a very small closet. We were on lower floors (5&6) so there really wasn't anything to look at through the window, but no problem with street noise.Would we stay here again. Yes. But probably for a shorter stay in a queen room (or larger) and preferably with a confirmed room on an upper floor.","Lausanne, Switzerland","David L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lausanne, Switzerland</strong>",103,5.0

They were friendly, helpful, and just down right cool all at the same time. When we walked in the bellman immediately picked up our accent and started a friendly conversation. It was a twist of southern hospitality twisted with a swanky NYC twist. We stayed in the penthouse, and our view was amazing. We will definitely be staying there again when we go back. The food at the restaurant downstairs was delicious. I recommend the salmon flatbread. Drinks, of course, were tasty.. everything was perfect!

Although the room was small (which is to be expected for NYC) it was comfortable and quaint. However I don’t think the bed we had was really a queen – it seemed small. The bathroom was a nice size and had really good water pressure in the shower. We had drinks in the restaurant one night and dinner another night. The service and the food were very good.

He assured me within a week he would email me a sample menu to approve we were over the moon, remember no tofu no mushroom the menu should have been our warning.I received a message from my daytime manager that you are going to be staying in the hotel and were looking for vegan options for 3 meals a day for your 3 day stay. The chef has put together a list of dishes that we can execute for you but we are otherwise limited in our ability to offer anything more.

This should have been our first warningI contacted the hotel they said I never told them, hmmm I never told them about two food products that could put me in intensive care? Yes I do that all the time I love the ER.So we arrive at the hotel and we check into a room yes the bathroom was amazingly ADA compliant and huge you could throw a flash mob in there, but would you want to?When we walked and rolled in and there was a smell and the toilet in a $600 room was full of human poop and a large chunk of hair as if someone had a haircut and put the cuttings in a toilet?We rolled to the bed it was accessible, I could roll all around it and we pulled back the quilt and as Ella touched it her hand was black, there was a puddle of ink as if from a broken pen all over the sheet where the pillow sat.?Wonderful we turned around to unpack and the wall behind the door was cover with paint splatter as if someone had shook their brush to get the excess of it was also all over the carpet in the door way.Ella stepped back and something made her trip, the door jamb normally screwed into the floor to stop the door hitting the wall came unscrewed and she almost trod on it with two sharp screws sticking up she turned to look at a 6ft by 3 ft. mirror held on the opposite wall by corner brackets of anodized steel and it was crooked that this was an 18 sq. ft. mirror weighing 50-60lbs and it was crooked and the bottom bracket holding it on was hanging on by only instead of 4 screws?We called for housekeeping they said they would clean the toilet in 4 hours when we went out so Ella had to clean the toilet herself, the mirror the same and the sheets also in four hours?We came back after the early dinner the wall still looked like a Jackson Pollock. The carpet had snowflakes, the mirror was sort of fixed but still loose and dangerous.The sheets were changed, no ink just a 2 inch circle of someone else’s blood? All before dinnerDINNER-Remember three and a half weeks to organize the menu? So we have a wonderful kale salad, it was really good I thought wow this guy made this just for us that was the appetizer.Entrée came, it was roasted root vegetables on tiny pasta, the kind a knowledgeable chef would only ever use for soup, never an entrée, it was disappointing heavy and oily. We bought our own wines all Australian so at least that was good but the bill was $180 for salad and gluggy pasta?We went back to the room and had some Australian tawny port we were still hungry so I rang room service and asked did they do French fries and the call went like this-OPERATOR- jade hotel room service how can I help?ME- do you do friesOPERATOR- yes we doME- what size is the serve? Is it big enough for two?Operator- I don’t know are you an over eater?ME- I beg your pardon?OPERATOR-well if you pig it down it won’t be enough for you, if you eat normal maybe there’ll be some for your wife.ME- Enough with the rudeness, all I’m asking is, is the serve size a side dish or entrée?Operator- how big do you eat when it comes to sides?ME- I’m calling a manager.So we called a manager and we asked also for two extra pillows, the pillows arrived bare with no pillow cases, we asked where they were? they gave us tow and said put them on yourselves?The manager Chris came in and we told him everything showed him everything and his response was free fries?The pillows, as we were looking at them had black mold on them? We showed Chris, he photographed them and rang for two more they came up also without pillow cases and we were told again to put them on ourselves.Christmas morning came we went three blocks to bean for breakfast, and we had a 1 pm booking for lunch we came back to the room to kill some time and started watching a movie something was wrong with the volume we tried to increase it it would no go higher than 50 out of 100, on the volume level we rang for someone to come up thinking it was broken we were told ""well just watch louder channels"" they finally sent someone he took an hour to change the program and three times told us ""mtv is loud watch that"" so we gave up and went down for dinner. you know remember the specially organized just for us menu?Another great salad was served for appetizer and the identical roast veggies as the night before except the gluggy pasta was changed out for gluggy rice so oil sodden that when the plate was knocked the oil splashed.We called Liam the manager over, he asked us what he was meant to do. We suggested it go away and something else replace it. Thirty minutes later two plates of pasta cut up like you were feeding a baby with a sprinkling of cherry tomatoes, caramelized onion, garlic and basil? Strange it was so sweet it was almost a desert but we were ravenous we ate it, it was a very small serve.Before it was finished I was clammy and sweating and nauseous, we asked for the manager the replacement meal was it strictly to my diet restrictions? He thought so but his quote was they can only do so much on short notice? Short notice they had three and a half weeks and two emails back and forth to get it right.Within five minutes I was on my back in bed distended stomach vomiting diarrhea feeling like someone was twisting my intestines till I yelled I stayed that way till I slept exhausted.That night Liam said he would take the entrée off the bill? He said no culinary professional could guarantee no cross contamination? Really in Australia and Europe we call that mandatory health education for all cheffing apprentices, you don’t learn it you don’t graduate.I awoke at 11pm able to eat so with all we were paying and a so called international chef the only way to guarantee my health was to roll for ten blocks find a vegan Chinese restaurant and buy ourselves vegan dumplings? Three weeks and we get takeaway?We checked out this morning and we got the bill, we never ate breakfast once in house but there was a charge for breakfast, the bill he was removing wasn’t it had to be adjusted from over three hundred above the room cost to $150.Now don’t get me wrong like every other hotel Ella and I have reviewed there were some redeeming qualities, some.Paulina on front desk was amazing and she organized the chef even if everything after her was screwed up.JOE The barman extraordinaire in the Restaurant during both screw ups was world class and I would steal him in a heartbeat.The unknown Hispanic waiter who made coffee in the restaurant he not only made the perfect quad espresso but he was the kind of professional that even with all the Christmas patrons 24 hours later he greeted us and smiled and said to us “would you like another soy cappuccino for your wife and quad espresso for you?” a true professional who remembers people orders and makes them feel specialApart from that the staff at the jade hotel would be lucky to make the worker of the month wall at Popeye’s chicken definitely not Mc Donald’s. They would never ask “do you want fries with that” without first insulting you!Finally to the décor, when I first entered I assumed it was a revamped brownstone so I forgave the scratched paint the dirty glass the raggedy carpet and the generally lackluster upkeep of the address I figured after all it was a couple of hundred years old? That was until I was informed it was barely 18 months old? Someone yelled “just get it damn well open” so they did paint bleeds everywhere paint splatters on the wall paper, painters tape still left on stone work painted over fractured tiles scratched chrome work in the elevators tiny narrow hallways and a check in counter barely 6ft long with a 3 ft. square pillar blocking its view leaving a gap so narrow that half of the counter is obscured from the customers and definitely wheelchairs!In the native American community jade has holy qualities, in jewelry it sparkles and is precious unfortunately in 13th st Manhattan it stands for a hole in the wall a blind man would be glad to see as long as he didn’t put his glasses on because the owners must surely and sadly be jaded to let things stand as they are I would say close but no cigar but if the cigar was yours I’d probably get sick from it we won’t be back jade and neither will anyone we can tell.P.S. when we double checked what was in the replacement bad pasta he informed this chef made caramelized onions by deep frying them? No matter the meal sucked.A further foot note- we later when bored went through the room service menu and found to out dismay the extra special personally designed just for us vegan menu thta took three weeks was actually standard room service items just with the dead animal removed? so lets correct one thing about this story they are good at lying","New York City, New York","Mia V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",11,1.0

The rooms are comfortable, clean and warm although on the small size. The bed was really comfortable and the shower/WC adequate. If I return to New York or should I say, if can afford to return to New York I would stay here again but opt for the larger room. New York is quite expensive and the hotel bar is best avoided except for a drink before going out to a more affordable bar maybe. The breakfast was good but just a walk one block takes you to the French Roast cafe bar which was excellent value. The hotel staff members were very obliging as were all New Yorkers we met, offering advice without you even asking. Getting around the city from West 13 St is easy using the Metro. Buy a card at the machine and top up with 10, 20 or 30 dollars. Each train journey costs 2.50, so is there were four of you you can get to your destination for 10 bucks avoiding all the traffic jams. However when the traffic is quiet you can get to Times Square or Battery park for 10 bucks with 4 in a cab and dropped off at the door. Don't be afraid to walk around even in the evening we never saw any problem. We had a guide for our first day who showed us how to get around and the sites of downtown Manhattan her name was Betty and can be contacted on betty@ontimenewyork.com, highly recommended.Would definitely recommend the Jade Hotel and Greenwich Village.","Pontypridd, United Kingdom","Mike E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pontypridd, United Kingdom</strong>",16,4.0

Check. Free wifi? Check. Cool rotary telephones? Crazy check! (Loved this touch)My only issue was that the ""validated"" parking was hard to find and not terribly convenient. I wound up parking at a closer but more expensive garage, but as it was a rainy and busy evening, I wasn't up to the hassle of the inconvenient parking area. So be warned if you're driving in.This minor incident did not at all detract from our enjoyment of this lovely property, and the vibrance of the Greenwich Village neighborhood.","Patterson, New York, United States","VReynolds61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Patterson, New York, United States</strong>",36,4.0

I was thrilled to discover a hotel in my favorite neighborhood that provides stylish elegance and intimate charm. I've stayed in many NYC hotels as a visitor, with the high expectations and insider knowledge of a NY native who lived in Manhattan over 25 years. The Jade wins top billing on all counts. It has it all. The room was more spacious than many with a super comfortable bed, crisp linens, great spacious waterfall shower and a view of lower Manhattan made for a movie. The lantern lit entrance takes on the beauty of a small European hotel at night with classic, not campy, Art Deco style. I loved starting or capping off a long day lounging by the lobby fireplace and lounge areas, with the NYTimes or alluring library corner of gorgeous books. Grape and Vine is a ""real"" restaurant and bar with energy and authenticity that's destination worthy; fantastic, fresh food for breakfast and dinner. I joined a friend in a velvet booth and we could even hear ourselves talk. My favorites and the best local cafes,restaurants and jazz clubs of NY are an easy walk. Above all, the staff are gracious but without attitude. Everyone from the front door to the front desk to housekeeping were professional, alert, attentive, can-do, thoughtful and kind. They create an atmosphere of contentment, care, safety, style and serenity. This is rare, and I was amazed by the service for a small hotel. It's one of the most charming neighborhoods of the city and a walkers paradise from chelsea art galleries and the High Line to all of downtown. I lived in the area years ago, and The Jade felt like the perfect NY apt.

Between the fireplace, marble and velveteen textures, it's hard to discern where the hotel starts and the wine bar begins.My room (The Barrow Queen on the 5th floor) was well appointed and made excellent use of space. Where room was needed, room was given. The bathroom was spacious, and I was pleased with the extra linens and luxurious shower essentials. The bed was crisp and comfortable and the level of cleanliness was platinum standard. The 1920s design touches were tasteful and not the least bit overdone or suffocating. The noise level from within the hotel was low to average as one would expect in any hotel, and we didn't hear so much as a whisper off 13th Street. Staff blended lightheartedness with real know-how in the most genuine and least pretentious ways possible--a lost art among other franchise hotels. The free wifi was much appreciated, but the staff served to be the best guides, giving specific advice on transportation, sightseeing, and food (not least of which included the exceptional hotel restaurant Grape & Vine).The booking experience was painless through the Jade Hotel's website. Pay close attention to the extras for each room type as some boast patios or soaker tubs. There are also notes as to which floors certain room types can be found so that you can customize your stay. If a view or added pacing room is important to you, it can be found at an exceptionally reasonable price considering your location in one of the most sought-after neighbourhoods in New York City.I had an exceptional stay at the Jade Hotel--one that I'd like to repeat very soon.

You could almost miss it ; its tucked away in a street in the village that is pretty quiet at night ( not so much in the day, since a design school is across from it) - but it's worth a visit both because of it's restaurant , the Grape and Vine ( or vice versa, I forget) and because it's just so cute. You walk down the stairs to get checked in which immediately makes the place seem cozy ( but on the other hand, is a pain in the neck if you have luggage and no bellman is there to help you) and immediately you can see little nooks where it's easy for a couple to have a private moment together. The first floor however is bigger than it seems on your entry; if you go through a low archway ( it almost seems like the entry to a speakeasy) you come out to a charming restaurant, bordered by booths and light and pretty. You will get a great breakfast there ( fresh fruit juices, smoothies and many perfectly done egg dishes including several great iterations of Eggs Benedict ) and imaginative food later in the day and evening.. I had perfectly done salmon and a Kale salad that would have been a yummy main dish all by itself. Both breakfast and dinner had friendly servers that were attentive and fun to interact with.The room sizes vary a lot- so be careful if you get claustrophobic in boutique sized spaces. But mine was a nice size, cheerfully decorated, with a good desk and an especially comfortable easy chair next to the bed. . It had a nice peekaboo view of the Freedom Tower and several roof gardens ( a plus) and a big shower ( a minus for me- I need a bath tub in a romantic room) but still the over all effect was cozy, sensual, and a bit chic.( I don't like a lot chic or trendy- it makes me feel like the hotel is only aiming for someone 25 , which I definitely am not) Overall effect, not luxurious but sweet and tastefully done and a room you could spend some hours in and feel taken care of.

But I wasn't prepared for the total fail in basic guest services. The staff was super friendly but the little things just kept adding up to make my nights totally miserable:- Massive banging noise - like a heavy closet door slamming in my ear - every time the air conditioner cycled off. Every 5 minutes all night long. Worst night ever. I asked the next morning if someone could look at it. They said yes. Even so, I left with the feeling that nothing would be done. Came back that evening, asked the front desk if someone had fixed it and the gentleman said he thinks it is a 'customary noise'. I said we would have to change rooms or hotels so I could get some sleep. He called engineering. They recreated the noise, brought in ladders and tools and fixed it. Perfect. - After three mornings of waking up with puffy red eyes and sniffles I asked the front desk if they could possibly have missed my note of a feather allergy when I booked the room. Yep, the pillows were fluff but my comforter was full of feathers. They changed it out right away. My fourth night was bliss - quiet, comfortable - and I could breathe. Too bad I had only 1 good night out of 4.- Turn down service showed up at 5:30 every evening. Isn't that when most guests are in their rooms resting or getting ready to go out? When I asked them to come back later, like in 15 minutes, the answer was now or never... or we'll try.

The room was very clean, the air conditioner made a loud clanging noise when it automatically went off. It sounded like a metal bar hitting a metal bar. It kept waking me up all night long. I asked if the engineer could fix it. Never happened. This is a classy hotel on a beautiful street. Plenty of great restaurants and shops...nearby buses and subway...and taxis a plenty. However-My third night there, a breaker blew in my room and the room went dark. I'm a disabled senior, who sleeps with a c-pap machine and I had no place to plug in my machine, so I couldn't go to sleep. There was no one to fix it, as the engineer went home at 11pm, so I did not have lights restored to my room. Thank God the bathroom light was still working. I had an important meeting in the morning and I had to sleep. Finally, I called down to ask if there was a long extension cord I could use. They brought it up and I finally went to sleep. It was awful. I asked to move to any other room but was ignored. I was moved the next night to a double room where the air conditioner still made the clang noise when it turned off. So I wasn't happy. The next day, the manager took the entire day off my bill. Would I stay there again? Not sure. But if you stay there, be prepared for a very small room. There is no dresser and only three tiny drawers in an armoire which doubles as the closet. So I lived out of the suitcase.The staff is super nice and polite. I got used to the small room, and the delicious free breakfasts delivered by room service daily.

The staff couldn't have been more helpful and charming, although the reception desk is behind you when you come the stairs, which means that you have to seek out the staff as you don't pass the desk when you exit. I would say that space is a little tight in the hotel; the passageway to the restaurant and the lifts is a bit narrow and our room which was one of the larger ones, was a bit just for 4 people, but no more so than you would expect in this part of NYC.

However, we will come back as often as we can because of the STELLAR customer service! We were here during NYU's move-in weekend and the hotel was very busy, yet every single staff member we encountered had a big smile, answered questions intelligently, and just basically went out of their way to make sure we felt special. From our first encounter with Irving dashing out to get our bags from the car, to Joe at the bar giving us great restaurant advice, to Jackie and ALL the front desk staff and front door staff making sure we had everything we needed - I just can't say enough about what a fantastic experience we had! Kudos to the management for hiring such friendly and helpful professionals. You have a great team!We stayed four days and three nights, and are extremely pleased with the value and service that The Jade provided. Beds were super comfy and hard to leave in the morning! Yes, the rooms aren't giant, but ours was big enough for 3 people, spotlessly clean, well-appointed, and the Deco touches are to die for. This is NYC and the rooms were just as nice or nicer than places we've stayed in previous years. Yes, the showers do leak a little on the tile floors because of the solid glass decorative wall, but the heat and water pressure are fabulous. It was very hard to take a short shower because it felt so good - just what was needed after hours of walking! Terrific shampoo/soap/lotion, too. Just throw down the bath mat that's provided and no big deal. Best water pressure in NYC!Elevators could be a bit slow, but we were up and down to our room on the 7th floor very often, and only had one experience where we had to wait a bit. Really not a problem for us, and certainly not worth complaining over in light of how fantastic the rest of the experience was.The restaurant is very tasty - we ordered the salmon on bruschetta from the bar and it was delicious and was served promptly. The only less-than-stellar experience was the breakfast on Sunday. Service was a bit slow, and breakfast for 3 was $100 with tip and no cocktails, just water and coffee. It was good, but not $100 amazing. The restaurant wasn't crowded (4 tables) but food took between 30 - 45 minutes to arrive. Probably will skip that next trip - perhaps dinner is different. Our appetizer at the bar was fantastic, so I know the kitchen is capable of great things.Because there WILL be a next visit - as soon as we can schedule it! The Jade is in the best location in the Village - a 3 minute walk to 6th and every possible drug store, restaurant, cabs and shopping you could need. Five minutes over to 5th, less than 10 minutes walk to Washington Square, Union Square and subway stops. Highly recommend the delicious family Italian across the street, Da Andrea, for terrific service and affordable, scrumptious food.Overall, I would rate the Jade a 9.5 out of 10 due to the staff's unfailing friendliness, great location and general cool Deco vibe throughout. Breakfast was the only slight negative. We plan to visit our son at NYU as often as possible, and in The Jade, we have found the best NYC/Village hotel! No need to look further. We are extremely satisfied, found it to be a great value, and cannot wait to return!","Norman, Oklahoma","Elizabeth B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norman, Oklahoma</strong>",7,5.0

From the gaslight on the ivy covered wall outside, to the exotic spicy scent you are greeted with upon entrance down the lit alabaster staircase, the Jade demonstrates attention to detail. My husband and I won a package to New York that included a three night stay at the Jade, which is why we ended up here. Contacting the Jade to reserve the room was no problem. Check-in was a breeze and they had our room available early (we arrived at 1 pm). They explain at check-in that they have a restaurant in the hotel with 24 hour room service and Happy Hour from 4 to 7, with half off drinks and flatbreads. The two blue bottles of Saratoga water in your room is complimentary and they serve coffee in the lobby until 9 a.m., which was appreciated. You also get 3 gluten-free chocolate chip cookies on your bed with the turn down service. When we emerged off the elevators to the 12th floor, I felt a little claustrophobic, as it is a narrow hallway and tight quarters. The room itself was on the small side, but like a cruise ship cabin, they made use of all the space available. The room was beautifully decorated, with art deco touches of gold, black and chrome. There's a desk with an alarm clock, light, pen, outlets and snacks (for a charge). The room is equipped with a safe, iron, hair dryer, robe and slippers and nice toiletries. The pretty mirrored closet had adequate hangers and some small drawers. When I couldn't get into the safe, someone arrived quickly to fix it. The bed was extremely comfortable with a heavy comforter and nice pillows. The room was quiet except one morning (early), when we could hear the people next door talking. We took advantage of the Happy Hour, filled with an eclectic crowd of middle aged people (like us) and New York hipsters. One night we sat in the lobby and the hostess brought us our glass of wine to drink there. All the employees at the Jade were extremely friendly and helpful. The New York Times is available in the lobby and there are red umbrellas located by the entrance, which came in handy one rainy morning. There is no concierge, but the Front Desk employees were able to help us in navigating the city, finding the subway and train station and suggesting places to eat. The hotel is located in a residential neighborhood, not far away from Chelsea market and the Highline. We had breakfast at the hotel one morning. While it was good, it was expensive but there aren't really a lot of breakfast options around the hotel. I really enjoyed my stay at the Jade, although they did forget my wake up call the morning we were leaving. It came a half an hour late, but I was already awake and sorry to leave the Jade. Oh, this may sound weird, but I really liked their pens. The door man gave me his and said to keep it and it's orange, plastic and writes well. As a writer, I appreciate this fact and it's the little things like that- attention to detail- that sets the Jade apart.",Miami,"Glee47</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami</strong>",137,4.0

It is small but as others have noted nicely appointed and thoughtfully decorated. If we were staying longer I would definitely have felt claustrophobic in that space. We did, however, get a room on a higher floor which I had requested so we had a nice view and plenty of natural light. The downside of an upper floor is the very slow elevator. During our stay one of the two elevators was out of service so it was even slower than normal. One guest complained of waiting ten minutes!We found the staff helpful and cordial.

The whole hotel was very clean and has a high level of finish. It was pretty much perfect; good size room, shower and bed. Quiet street. Good day rate etc. There were, in our opinion, 2 things that could be improved on (which we did share with the reception at check-out); the lifts are really slow (nothing major) and the walls are a bit thin (as in you can hear a 'lot' of what happens in other rooms, if you get my drift!)Would we stay here again?

The room we had was comfortable and clean, and being an older building the walls were nice and thick, so we weren't listening in on other guests. My only minor issue was the lack of storage space: the wardrobe was small and the bathroom had very little shelf space for putting your own stuff.

The subway is conveniently located a block away giving ready access uptown and downtown. If you enjoy walking as we do, then there are numerous interesting suburbs all within walking distance (Chelsea, Soho, Noho, Tribeca, Little Italy, Nolita, Chinatown, East Village, Meatpacking District......). The hotel itself is beautifully decorated in the Art Deco style throughout - the lobby, downstairs bar and restaurant oozed 1930's cool. We stayed for 7nights, and while our room wasn't large (Club Deluxe) it catered for our needs more than adequately and with style (safe, ironing board, desk, seating and table etc). Loved the old world phone!! It also had a pleasant view of the street and School at the front of the hotel. The staff were ALL friendly and attentive, personable, interesting and importantly competent and eager to help in any way. My wife and I actually eloped in Central park while we were there and the staff were very excited for us and provided a bottle of champagne on the house in our room and shouted us drinks at the bar.

Even before arriving, I had to call the hotel and was pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the individual who answered the phone and my questions. From the moment we arrived and we were greeted by Bryant the doorman who opened the cab door and grabbed the suitcases before I had even paid the driver to the time that we checked out it was the best experience we have ever had at a NYC hotel. Bryant hailed cabs for us, grabbed umbrellas to cover us as soon as he saw us when it was raining, made great restaurant suggestions and when we asked about where the ice machine was had a bucket of ice sent to the room. Tamika, the hotel manager went above and beyond to make sure our stay was pleasant. We arrived very early and check in, as with most NYC hotels was at 3:00. My daughter wasn't feeling well so we asked if our room was available early. Tamika made it happen. It was by far one of the largest rooms we have ever had in the city, Including our stay at the Waldorf. This hotel is brand new and beautiful.They provide robes and slippers. We love to be able to hear the sounds of the city and you could open your windows in the room. We were able to make the best of the rain and fell asleep listening to it on the nights it rained. Black out curtains were amazing. Completely dark. Bed and linens were extremely comfortable.There is no tub in the rooms. Only showers. Room was very quiet once the inconsiderate morons in the room next to us left. Even when I complained about them, Tamika was willing to move us if the problem continued but we loved the room and fortunately they checked out. They have a half price happy hour for wine and flat breads which was very nice. Nancy is the hostess and has an amazing personality and was very helpful with new restaurants to visit in the area. There is a restaurant in the hotel and room service available. The only complaint, if I had to have one would be the prices in the restaurant are outrageous even by NY standards. Breakfast- OJ- 7.00, english muffin, yogurt w/granola and fruit and coffee over 35.00.. There is a restaurant for breakfast right around the corner with awesome food called HU and another one called Gray Dog both affordable and great food. This is our new go to hotel. We will DEFINITELY be going back to this hotel (as long as the cost and great service doesn't change) The professionalism and customer service is at a level that other NYC hotels could learn from. Don't hesitate to stay at this hotel. Oh... our favorite area is in the village and The Jade is perfectly located to Union Square, great shopping, subways and good restaurants and bakeries. The cost for this hotel is affordable and a great value for what you get.

It was only recently built, and while it looks like a small hotel from the street level, the rooms are in an 18 story tower behind the street facade. The lobby, bar, restaurant and the elevators to the rooms are one level below street level. One can enter the lobby down a staircase from the street entrance or via a side elevator off the street entrance. In spite of its recent construction it has an old world charm about it which may account for why it seems to appeal to the many well dressed and well spoken foreigners who were staying there. The entire staff from the Reception desk, to room service (24 hours) to the restaurant was uniformly friendly and accommodating. Unlike the Marlton Hotel on 8th Street, where the rooms are so tiny that there is not enough room for a suitcase, a chair, a desk, a bureau or for that matter anything at all except a bed, the rooms here are quite comfortable and have a lounge chair, desk, an armoir for hanging clothes and storing clothes and a fabric covered bench. The bathroom is modern and clean and the housekeeping service is very good. The larger rooms face south, and I would recommend a room on a higher floor for the sun to stream in during the day. The food is quite good in the restaurant. The location is perfect with lots of typical Greenwich Village restaurants very nearby. If I had to note a negative, it's the elevators. There are only two elevators that service the rooms and the restaurant. Because the designer did not spring for a staff elevator, the two elevators are constantly used by the staff housekeeping, maintence, room service and for transporting luggage in and out of the hotel, resulting in rather long wait times.

In other words, you are in east walking distance of arguably the most interesting neighborhoods in the city, full of great restaurants and one-off shops. Every evening, I would walk off in a different direction and be caught by the distinctly NY charm of the surrounding areas. But the Jade is about more than just location. The rooms are comfortably and afford you everything that you need. There is a small but inviting lobby that greets you at the bottom of the stairs, and in the back, a great little restaurant, the Grape and Vine, a rare find for a NY boutique hotel. The room is very well put together and the food very good. The hotel staff is young, what you would expect at the smaller, newer hotels, but the work hard to provide you what you need in the way of service. With all of that, the Jade will offer you rooms at less than what you would pay at other good hotels in the city, and chances are, a better experience.",United States,"DBA S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",190,4.0

On arrival the hotel looks grand from the outside, pulling off a bit of a throwback vibe to the 20s and 30s. Down the stairs and the lobby/lounge area was a little crowded by guests with drinks which made check in a little awkward, but c'est la vie. I was joining my better half who had provided my details to reception a few days earlier, but they had not recorded them properly which meant I needed to be ""verified"" by said better half - minus one for the sloppy record keeping, but plus one for keeping an eye out for guest security regardless. One other minor annoyance was the lack of a late check-out option, leaving me with no choice but to vacate by 11am and work in the lobby - although perhaps this was because they were fully booked, not due to a rigid policy.The room itself was very small, although I'm sure there are bigger (more expensive) rooms in the hotel. We didn't spend very much time in our room, so again, not a huge issue for us. I did try to get some work done on the Monday morning, which was difficult in the cramped confines though, so I'd suggest if you intend on staying here on business you may want to consider a bigger option on the room size. Very well appointed - the interior designer definitely had a good eye. One specific comment - for some obscure reason the shower was semi open (no door), which meant that the bathroom was flooded each time I showered...not a huge annoyance, but difficult to go in there again unless you're wearing shoes!Location is great (presuming you want to be in Greenwich Village obviously), with lots of bars, restaurants and shops within walking distance, as well as the subway.Staff were by and large friendly and helpful, and Liz and Pablo specifically looked after us very well in the bar in the evenings before or after our adventures out. Great cocktails, and a good wine selection, as well as some good bar food (although I'm not sold on the pickled pineapple!).I'd probably give this hotel a 3 (""good"") in the context of all the hotels I've stayed in over the years, but that's probably not really useful given that each hotel should be judged in relation to the offerings in its specific market - so for Manhattan/NYC, I'd go with ""very good"". We enjoyed our time here and will most definitely consider The Jade Hotel again when we're going to be back in the city...NYC has some worse offerings out there, be assured.

It is very well situated and if you didnt know, you couldnt guess it is there because it blends through the buildings around. Even if everything was booked through a travel agency & the company I work for, I was not aware that you need to give 100$ in deposit (that you are given back when you leave), so this fee wasnt planned in my budget. When I mentionned this to the front desk, and that I didnt have a credit card to leave a deposit, they didnt want to check me in, and kept on repeating the same phrase over and over again. Maybe they thought I didnt understand english well... When I mentionned that I didnt have a credit card, I felt a little snobbish attitude going on. My roomate came-in just in time, this way I could go in the room. About this room, looked very nice, very small, two double bed, a small armoire, tv, desk and a chair. The beds are VERY comfortable, made my nights easier. I wish there was a small fridge for convenience. Now about the bathroom, had to call to get toilet paper because it wasnt changed or refilled by the maid, neither were the tissus. The shower looks nice, BUT : the head pressure was very little, the water runs outside the shower and goes all over the place in the bathroom... not very hygienic. We didnt really have a view, what we saw on the 8th floor was the appartment building and all the people looking at us. Because of where it is situated and because I didnt have to pay for it, it is overall a good experience but I would never go back again knowing how expensive those rooms costs. There is a huge gap between the floor and the bottom of the door, by chance there was only about 6 rooms on each floor, not too much traffic & noise. Another bad thing is that I spotted mascara stains on the sheets and on my pillows... I could tell it had been washed, but it is still nasty to find those when you have your face on it!","Montreal, Canada","LaCoquette</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",1,3.0

Having trawled through Trip Advisor reviews, we decided on The Jade and what a great decision that was! It is a small, quiet, beautiful, new (only a year old) hotel that suited us perfectly. The staff are incredibly helpful and polite, the hotel décor is stunning and trendy (but not uncomfortably so) and it smelt amazing due to the fresh flowers and scented candles. We had a Bedford double on the 17th floor which had incredible views looking south towards Lower Manhattan - definitely worth asking for a room on the higher floors to get the views! The room was on the small side, like many in Manhattan, and a bit of a squash with two adults, two children plus bags and a pushchair! But to be honest we didn't spend much time in there and it was spotlessly clean and the beds were super comfy. Breakfast was good, the juices are incredible and we loved the granola with fruit. They even prepared a bowl for us to take away when we left at 5am! The hotel is in a fantastic location - 5 mins walk to the hub of Greenwich/Bleeker Street, 10 mins walk to Chelsea Market, Meatpacking District and the High Line and just off 5th Avenue with a good range of shops ranging from Gap, Zara, American Apparel and Aldo to Seven, Michael Kors and Kate Spade. If you don't mind walking you can walk up 5th Avenue (past the Flatiron and the Empire State Building) to Bryant Park, Grand Central etc in about 40 mins and just a little further to Madison Ave, Park Ave and Times Square. If, like us, you are travelling with small children there are lots of eating places really close by including fast food like Chipotle, burger & pizza places but also juice bars, bagels and healthy snack bars. The room service menu was limited but the food we had was very tasty and arrived about 15 mins after ordering. We would highly recommend The Jade for anyone who wants to stay away from the chain hotels and likes somewhere with a bit of character and comfort. We thought it was excellent value for money and would definitely return.","Colchester, United Kingdom","Emma W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colchester, United Kingdom</strong>",25,5.0

When I called reception I was given a non committal response with the desk person saying oh my really? I will inform the manager when I see them.

The location is brillaint, the atmosphere almost theatrical. It is a short walk to restaurants in Union Place, the Strand bookshop and Forbidden Planet on Broadway and live music venues in the Village (The Bitter End, Thompson St / Bleeker St). The hotel is a design classic in New York Deco and cocktail style - James Thurber and Dorothy Parker would not be out of place, though I suspect that much of this is restored or retrofitted. The staff could not have been more welcoming. The rooms are small but the radio was pre-tuned to public service broadcasting - while I was there they were broadcasting the complete Ulysses (Joyce, not Homer). Although the restaurant was excellent, better value and NY style could be had nearby - breakfast at the Grey Dog in university Place, lunch at The Human Kitchen, a 'fat Greek' burger at a diner round the corner.","Dublin, Ireland","908harryk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",48,4.0

It is the perfect example of a boutique hotel. Some would say the rooms are a little ""small"", but this is the expectation when you are in New York. From the lobby decorations to the restaurant downstairs, everything was beautiful.But, what made the lasting impression was the genuine service from the staff. I wish I remembered all of the employee’s names so they could get the recognition they deserve, but unfortunately I do not. I do remember Olympia at the front desk who was very helpful and kind. Once the staff found out I was in the process of moving they were extremely welcoming. They offered everything from restaurant reccomendations to tips for living in New York. I remember after my mom left and I was heading to my new apartment, the bellman called down from the street to wish me good luck, and to let me know that I was always welcome at The Jade Hotel.As a hospitality professional, this service meant a great deal to me.

The staff were very friendly and helpful, though at times a little clueless and there wasn't as much information in the room as one would expect, so the various services on offer weren't always clear.

Some of the sites said there were no rooms, so I called. The receptionist convinced me to stay in a slightly larger room than the standard. With the comments online about the small rooms we decided to upgrade to the larger gueen room. The room is still extremely small. The proportions of the room are unusual and it is so narrow it is hard to walk by the bed without getting banged by the frame. The room was very dark. There was not enough lighting. The art decoration decor was charming but did not make up for the size of the room.The hotel is in a fun area of the City and near great restaurants. The Jade has a wonderful bar. They have happy hour that is classy. The servers are polite and friendly. When we arrived it was in the middle of a main water break. We had a hard time getting to the hotel. Within one day the internet, tv and phones went out. The people at the front desk told us to go to Starbucks as if this was a normal thing to do. My husband asked if we would be compensated for the inconvenience but the young receptionist acted as though he was insulting her. We are both dependent upon the web for work and do not plan on camping out at Starbucks. We found another hotel and left paying full fare. This is an example of how not to treat your customers. They are a young hotel but it is no excuse for treating customers this way. It is not inexpensive for the size of the rooms.

There was no mini-bar/refrigerator of any kind so bringing back left overs was out of the question. The staff were all great.

We are ever so grateful that we were upgraded because to stay for 6 nights in any room smaller than ours would be pretty uncomfortable. The location of the hotel Greenwich, is great. Close to good shopping and restaurants and easy access to central NYC. Enjoyed good nutritious meals at the Hu ""clean organic food"" just a block away, and had a special meal out at ""Rosemarys"", again just a short walk in the opposite direction. Our hotel room on the 11th floor was comfortable and retro, though we had very limited closet space and no where to store our cases. Perhaps this is because most do not stay many nights. The shower had no curtain and we were never able to manage to shower without getting water all over the floor. The lifts were quite slow, especially at peak times as there appeared to be only 2 and the staff also used these to service rooms. The restaurant served breakfast which was fine and also dinner. There was a small bar also though at times we had difficulty getting served here. The hotel offered a ""turn down service"" because we were staying 6 nights which we accepted though it was not forthcoming for the final 3 nights! This hotel is mid range expensive, especially when all the TAXES are added.Our problem being from Australia is that we expect the tax to be included in the stated price (it is not) and we do not understand the constant tipping that is expected. After 5 + weeks travelling in the US that is one aspect of our travels that we were very glad to leave behind. Why not just pay your staff a decent salary? Why is it expected that we tip % of the bill when the service provided for something costing $10 is often the same as given for a bill of $80. We could not understand this.All in all, we would recommend the Jade, the welcome was warm and most of the staff were very helpful.

Firstly the positives, nice looking foyer and bar, pleasant front of house staff, modern fittings in a deco style. Rooms were nicely fitted albeit a bit small but I suspected that would be the case. Great location right between east and west village and a shirt stroll from Chelsea market in the meatpackers, also not badly priced compared to similar hotels in NYC.So why only 1 stars? Mainly really poor attention to detail in client contact, our housekeeper left our room consistently dirty and un replenished, we had to beg for our breakfast or meal or drinks on 3 occasions. And it's not that they were understaffed one morning we saw 3 waiters a manager, 2 bus boys and a hostess, with no more than 30 people having breakfast we had to wait 30 mins for coffee which had to be sent back as it was disgusting and then another 20 mins for food. Believe we chased it several times in this period. One evening we were prevented access to the hotel bar and restaurant as it had been sold for a private function which meant the only place to have food or drink in a 4 star hotel charging over $450 per night was the lobby. No pay tv option in the room and a tv with no guide so very limited places to go/ things to do. The straw that broke the camels back was the maid who stole money from our desk. It was only a small amount but maybe that's what happens every day? Anyway when I complained my friends in an adjoining room found an envelope with some replacement money in it shoved under their door not mine..... With no note so again not the best attention to detail. On check out it also appeared that they wanted to overcharge me by 450 because they had changed the system mid way through our stay and charged my credit card before check out without authorisation...... I explained these issues at check out and they made no effort to make amends at all, Unfortunately they are pretty full so I doubt this review will have any effect but between myself and my friends we paid nearly $10000 for our stay at the Jade and we all thought it was extremely poor and will never go back or recommend it to anyone.

Great location, stylish but cozy design, comfortable bed, great service all around, lovely in house restaurant for breakfast and even dinner = perfect stay.

If you want space to stow away luggage from view in the room, have a table where two can have a room service meal or spread out to work at a desk, this is not the hotel. But the public spaces though small are well arranged and pleasant to meet people for drinks or a short chat and bite in the lounge or for a longer meal in the restaurant. Appreciated having a gym downstairs which was well set up tho tiny.As others have pointed out, the service is attentive without being overly present. For long stays for more than one person I definitely recommend the Greenwich Penthouse for the extra space in the room, a large bath with tub and the balcony which is good place to have breakfast in good weather or just to have access to outdoors on the 17th fl.

The gorgeous aesthetic of the lobby and restaurant carries in to the rooms with period styled furniture and wall treatments. The rooms are small, in true Manhattan fashion, but very comfortable. A friend and I stayed for 4 nights in a double room with two double beds and had a great stay. The beds are super comfy with high quality linens and pillows, and the staff turns them down for you every evening and leaves truffle chocolates on your pillow. We had no problem with the length of the beds, but as we are both average height females, I could see that your feet might dangle off the end if you're tall. The bathroom has nice fixtures and they provide C.O. Bigelow bath products, robes and slippers. There are 4 small glass shelves near the mirror and a larger shelf under the sink with extra towels etc. We had enough room to store 2 toiletry kits, and lay out some of our cosmetics. The curtains work well to block out light at night, and we found the room to be quiet and restful (we were on the 10th floor). I would suggest requesting a room on a higher level that is away from the elevator, to reduce the amount of noise from hallway traffic late at night. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is not a lot of closet space; it's about 2ft deep with a single hanger bar, 3 small drawers at the bottom and an area for shoes. Upper shelf has a bit of space but also contains the in-room safe. This is more than adequate if you are only staying for a few days but I will admit it gets a bit squishy when you've got two people's clothes for 5 days. In order to make the most of the closet, we both packed extra wire hangers and hung up as many of our clothes as we could. The rest we managed to fit in the drawers or on the shelf. Once we were unpacked, we put our suitcases one-inside-the-other and stored them in the space above the closet. This really helped with keeping the room free of clutter and maximizing the space. There is a bench seat and desk in the room which provide enough surface storage for putting down purses and daily shopping. The hotel is 2 blocks from a subway station on M, F, L and Path lines, so it makes getting around pretty easy if you want to avoid cabs. It's also in easy walking distance to the Meatpacking district and Highline. There are some nice restaurants in the area and I would highly suggest Murray's Bagels, right around the corner, for breakfast. Finally, I'd like to mention that the staff at The Jade is really friendly and helpful. Everyone we met there, from the desk staff to the bellmen, to the waiters in the restaurant and the housekeepers, were courteous, smiling and more than willing to help us with anything we needed. So overall, we had a great experience and would definitely stay at The Jade again. It is expensive, as most good hotels in New York are, but I felt that they delivered good quality for your money.","Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","Melissa Z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

Loved the overall stay and felt very at home but the stint was not without a few minor issues. It was a work trip but I also had some friends staying for leisure too at the same time. Firstly, it's a really cosy living room feel to the entrance - dark, sexy and homely, the restaurant is great and has the same vibe. Food is excellent. It's like a mini-Bowery Hotel with a slightly more vibrant personality. Rooms also had the same darkness to them and not particularly condusive to any working in the evening. They are fairly small too - this extends to the size of the closets (literally can hang about 7 garments) and the beds are quite short. My male friend staying in a double room had his feet dangling off the end of the bed (he is 6 foot).Bathrooms are bright and well-equipped and maintained. Rooms are fully equipped besides having a minibar. This was a little frustrating if you wanted a late night soda and didn't want to leave the hotel or call room service.Another irritation for me personally was faulty air-con system that clattered on and off when on auto mode. Not great for a good night's sleep but the helpful front desk were quick and willing to move me to another room.Location is fantastic and close to all the great restaurants and bars of Greenwich Village. Also close to the subway, which was convenient.However, the thing that really makes this place are the staff - shout outs to Matt, Keron, Andy, Julia and the lovely hostess at Grape and Vine. This was definitely one of the main reasons that will have me returning here.","Chislehurst, United Kingdom","LentilsMum</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chislehurst, United Kingdom</strong>",72,4.0

The lobby is elegant but inviting (hard to believe that the hotel is new construction). The Jade gets extra credit for being a boutique hotel that offers some double rooms in addition to the ubiquitous king. And extra-extra credit for having top sheets in addition to the equally ubiquitous comforter, thereby giving the guest a temperature option between roasting and freezing. We were in a Bedford double on the 18th floor with a fantastic southern view.I can't really find any flaws with the Jade, but travelers should be aware that the rooms are indeed small (including the doubles), as others have noted. Also, the immediate neighborhood, while within a easy walk of Flatiron, Union Square, and the heart of the West Village, is somewhat dead and mostly students from The New School. On the plus side, we never heard any street noise. Finally, the beds are comfortable, but we had one issue which made sleeping difficult. It was mechanical and I am hopeful that it can be easily fixed (I reported it while checking out). The a/c blows quite hard (which was ok with me), but when the blower cut off, it was followed (precisely 3 seconds later) by a loud clank. Maybe the fan shutting down? I'm not sure what it was, but it meant that if you weren't dead asleep, you couldn't help but steel yourself for the clank each time you heard the blower stop. I highly recommend adding the Jade to your list of NYC hotels. I'm certain I'll go back--clanks or no clanks.","Alexandria, Virginia","James B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",24,4.0

We had booked 2 rooms, for our stay, a double for our teenage kids & a Queen room for my wife & I. We were allocated these rooms on the 12th floor, the kids rooms with 2 double beds was not huge by other U.S. hotel rooms standards but ok, Our Queen size room was too small, for 2 adults , with suitcases. As we were booked in for 5 days, I went down to reception to see if we could be moved to a twin room. I was told that the hotel was fully booked, & a twin room would not become available for another 2 days, but as soon as it did, we could move into it. Ok, fine, it wasn't the hotels fault we'd booked a small room. By the time I got back to my room, the phone was ringing, it was the front desk, advising me there was a double room available the following day, next to our kids & if we left our suitcases packed up, they would transfer them over, whilst we were out the following day. Brilliant Service. The hotel is in a very quiet location, & we heard no noise overnight ( v. unusual for N.Y) .However this hotel is in a brilliant location for sightseeing. Less than 2 blocks to the nearest subway, no more than 10 mins walk to Washington Square ,couldn't fault it. Toiletries of a high standard, bed turn down service. We didn't eat or drink in the hotel as it was quite pricey & to be honest we were out & about for 12 hours at a time so tended eat on the hoof, so to speak. The attitude of the staff was a ""can do "" one, very refreshing, nothing was too much trouble . My only criticism, is that there are no coffee making facilities in the rooms, so if you want a hot drink you have to ring down to room service .$5.00 for a coffee, I don't think so . Every hotel we stayed in prior to arrival in N.Y offered room & lobby coffee, so was a little disappointed with this aspect. However they do provide complimentary bottled water .

Seemed nice to have some outdoor space when visiting New York during the summer. The price was only just above 100$ more than for a regular room for three nights. But apparently there was a bit of a problem calling the room a suite so some time after we booked the website changed the name and just called it a Deluxe room. When arriving we noticed why, size-wise I'm guessing the regular rooms are not much smaller and in a suite you at least expect a livingroom area and a more spacious feel. This room (201) was as small as your average New York hotel room and changing the description seemed appropriate, although It would've been better not calling it a suite from the start. The terrace of course was quite nice, but it was towards the back yard and not much sun reached it until later in the afternoon since it was on the second floor. I've read reviews of people having views of the Empire State Building, but maybe those we're not from the Hudson Queen Deluxe in particular? I'm not sure if they changed the description to ""garden view"" after I booked or if it was there from the start, but If I had known I probably would've just a booked regular room with chances of a better view. Still, the room was beautiful. Great bed, okay pillows and wonderfully designed bathroom with ℅ Bigelow bath products. Nice to stay in a new hotel that really feels new. Being slightly disappointed with the size of the room, it not being a suite when paying for a suite, and the terrace not facing the street was not a big letdown when the interior and feel of this hotel was so good in every other way. Location just perfect. Stayed at the Mondrian in Soho earlier this year and I really don't like the hustle and bustle of the Soho streets close to that hotel. Here you're in a calm setting, just by 6th Avenue and a lot of good breakfast spots. Also you're just a few blocks from Union Square and not far from Washington Square Park. The Jade Hotel has probably the best location for any hotel I've stayed at in New York if you really like the downtown brownstone feel. Front desk staff and bell boy were kind and helpful and If I get this good deal again, we'll probably stay here next time.

I suspect that there is a design flaw in the air conditioning as it is located in the bathroom ceiling in these rooms. It is possible humidity condenses and freezes on the exchange pipes hidden in the ceiling. Perhaps it is an underpowered system for the upper floors. The staff was professional but indifferent to us.

I stayed here in a Grove Queen room for 6 nights in late June. This is a boutique hotel. The rooms are small but smartly designed and decorated with custom wall paper and lacquered mahogany furniture. Super comfortable bed; very effective air conditioning; and excellent water pressure in the shower. Very quiet. I could not hear other guests or street noise. Nightly turn-down service. The Jade looks and feels warm and intimate throughout. It comes across almost like a private club in Paris or London. It does not feel like a New York hotel, and that’s a good thing. The lobby is small and while you can have drinks there, it is not a “scene”. This is not a typical tourist hotel and probably wouldn’t be good for someone on business travel or for folks traveling with small children. Great location at the top of Greenwich Village between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Very easy walk to Union Square, Gramercy Park, Flatiron, West Village, NYU, Chelsea, and Soho. Easy access to major subway lines going north and south to Times Square, east side Museums, Lincoln Center, Tribeca, and Lower Manhatan.Plenty of nifty, relatively inexpensive (for New York) restaurants, cafes, and interesting shops frequented by area residents (as opposed to visitors) on surrounding blocks. Try O Cafe on Sixth Avenue and 12th Street; Sotto 13 on 13th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues; and French Roast on Sixth Avenue and 11th Street (open 24 hours). Great take-away gourmet eats perfect for room snacks or a picnic basket at Citarella’s (Sixth Avenue at 9th Street). Finally, a word about the staff and service: magnificent. Special mention to Matt and Kyle at the front desk but everyone (remember, I was there for a week so I believe I met everyone…) was friendly, engaged, pro-active, solution-focused, and gracious. They all seemed genuinely glad to be working at the Jade and that makes for happy, return guests.","Richmond, Virginia","Paul B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",110,5.0

We were assigned a room on the 4th floor, their friendly bellhop carried our luggage and showed us the room. Loved that we didn't feel pressured to leave him tip, and when we did he was very thankful.Location was great for this hotel, as it's in Greenwich, so very close to Chelsea, Flatiron district and Meatpacking District. There is a Citi Bike station at the corner of the street, making it easy to walk out the hotel and explore the city by bike (10$ for 24 hours, no additional charges if you use the bike for less than 30 minutes). Several restaurants (including a self-serve frozen yogurt place, yum!), a 7-11, a market and a CVS minutes away. Broadway st is an approximate 10 minute walk away, with plenty of stores to shop around. Madison Square Park is about the same time, meaning it won't be difficult stopping there and grabbing some Shake Shack! Check it out, there's always a line up, but it's worth it as it's one of the most amazing burgers ever! Biking to Time Square took us about 15 minutes.Service was incredible, and which made our stay there so much more enjoyable. Emilio at the front desk was super friendly, could of chatted with him for hours! We always came back to an impeccably clean room. Bed was really comfortable. Usually when I travel I always say to myself ""can't wait to sleep in my bed!"" but not this time, I wish I could of brought their mattress back with me! Many good TV channels, so there was always a good 90's-2000 comedy movie that we could watch! If I had to say one ""negative"" about the room, it would be the bathroom. Nothing major though, but if you want to be picky, the door was transparant (frosted though) so if you're not comfortable sharing your silhouette with your roommate, then you might dislike this. The shower also didn't have a door, so water would splash out and wet the bathroom floor. Besides that, nothing bad to say, water pressure was really strong, something I truly appreciate when traveling and staying in hotels! A/C worked perfectly. I have nothing to say against the size of the room, it was comparable to other hotels I've stayed at in NYC. The bellhop was always there to open the doors as we exited or entered the hotel, and always with a big smile. We were able to have our bags stored on our last day, after our check out, so we could go out for lunch and shop a little before driving back to Montreal. Check out was a little more complicated than checking in as there was a mistake made on our credit cards, but we were well taken care of. They apologized and told us the problem would be fixed when we got back, which they did. I had a really good stay at the Jade Hotel, would of loved to stay longer, and will definitely be going back on my next trip to NYC.

They couldn't do enough for me. Got a larger room than was booked for........all great.Now the problems begin......I check my bank account the next morning and The Jade had put a hold on $2200 of my money (supposed to be 1017) That was quite a bit more!I was directed to the manager Brian (who was AWESOME) and he couldn't have been nicer and dealt with this situation immediately. The money was credited to my account. ALL WAS WELL!Jump to day 3 and upon checking my account, the money was DEBITED AGAIN! So now I have bounced checks and returned charges all over the place. Needless to say I spent the morning on the phone calling all of these places to explain myself. NOT a good way to spend time in NY.The only great thing about this hotel is the staff. They are charming, helpful, interesting and engaging. The service in the restaurant was slow and food was just ok.

Keron was the first person to greet us at the Jade Hotel when we pulled up curbside in our limousine. He was beaming with the brightest smile, and was eager to help us get settled in our room. Whenever we saw him during our stay, he always made a point to ask us if we needed anything. Keron is management material. We truly appreciated him. Courtney in the restaurant also provided superb service; she asked the hotel chef to make a vegetarian dish for us the first night we dined there and it was fantastic. Five stars for the restaurant. (Courtney also gave us great advice about where we could find good vegan restaurants in town. Thank you, Courtney!)Now for the hotel itself. Where do I begin? It's in a fantastic location, and it's sparkling new. We made reservations for the Greenwich Penthouse, which was advertised as having a queen size bed and a separate ""living area."" The bed was more like a double; it's width was nowhere near the width of our two queen beds at home. Maybe the beds are some European version of a queen bed. The so-called ""living area"" was equally disappointing. It consisted of a padded bench & a low profile chair right next to the bed. There was no ""area""-- the penthouse is one small room with a very generously sized bathroom with a bathtub spout that was improperly fitted (it was too short to direct water flow directly into the tub, and instead puddled up and dribbled down onto the floor creating a slippery mess. And the awesome tub is really high, so if you're shorter than 5'11"" good luck getting in and out). The amenities in the bathroom fell short, too. Not much product to rely on, and the product they did provide smelled less than pleasing. (Of course, this is a subjective assessment; reasonable minds will differ on this point.)Again, we had expectations when we reserved the ""penthouse."" A penthouse is a specially designed apartment on an upper floor, especially the top floor, of a building."" Imagine our surprise when we exited the elevator short of the top floor. And then to learn there were four rooms, two on each side of the building separated only by a little planter with a baby juniper between the outdoor patios. Read: little, if any, privacy. That said, we loved the outdoor space, despite it's tiny footprint, and the fact that the step leading to it did not appear to be up to code. The view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building in the distance was probably our favorite part of our stay.When we called hotel management expressing our disappointment with the queen size bed and ""living area,"" we were not provided with an adequate explanation. Am I bitter? Probably, because we had high expectations based on the hotel's representations on its web site. For the price we paid for this pseudo-penthouse, we could have gotten a suite elsewhere. Indeed, we wound up going to the Intercontinental in Midtown and got a room with a king-size bed, and a separate living room for less money than the Jade Hotel. The furniture in the room is nothing to write home about. It seemed to us to have more of an Asian influence, not art deco. The low bedside tables don't have a lot of real estate, but there is no shortage of outlets to plug in all your i-devices. That is a big plus. Don't expect to get a late checkout. The hotel has only two small elevators that are used by the hotel cleaning staff -- there is NO service elevator. The maids have to shlep their carts on the same elevators used by hotel guests. What were the architects thinking? Don't expect a separate business/meeting room either. You won't find any business accommodations here. There you have it. Beautiful, new hotel with ""penthouse"" rooms that are disappointing because they are not truthfully represented. For NY standards, the hotel is pretty and clean . . . and petite. For us, the hype and hip factor of the hotel failed to compensate for the shortcomings stated above. Will we return? Probably not. There are too many other options in NYC. But if you're looking for clean, hip hotel in the Village, with no other expectations, you will likely be very happy.",,PhotonDance,5,3.0

This hotel is really quite special right down to the morsel of life changing deliciousness I experienced when I returned back to my room one evening. My housekeeper left a red velvet treat on my bed it was superb. The desk agent told me they are made fresh daily from a local bakery. The employees at the hotel are wonderful and go out of their way to make you feel special. When I arrived I had my wallet tucked away in one of my travel bags Keion and Brian at the front door offered to pay my taxi until I got in and settled, this is real genuine service. The location is right in Greenwich Village so we were able to walk everywhere and did not have to take any cabs. My sister had an incredible view from one of the higher floors so we could see the new Freedom Tower it was beautiful. My only criticism is the phone situation. When I called to inquire about the location I was put on hold and the same when I called back to make my reservation. When I arrived at check in the phone kept buzzing over and over and the attendant had to keep answering. The staff is professional but I felt rushed because of the phones and I did not feel comfortable to stay and ask the questions I had intended to ask. Every day I would sit in the gorgeous lobby reading while having tea and It was hard to concentrate or relax with the desk agent constantly answering the phone saying Jade Hotel.

I opted for a queen-bedded Greenwich Penthouse room on the 18th floor, and I'm glad that I did because the bedroom area was still a bit cramped. There was only a small set of drawers inside the wardrobe, which made it a challenge to unpack as fully as I would have liked. The bathroom with separate deep tub and shower was on the larger side and nicely appointed. The bed was quite comfortable.There are two elevators; one was out of service during part of our stay. Even when both were operating, the wait for one to arrive on the 18th floor could take a couple of minutes. Due to the elevator situation, and thinking about a future stay, I did look at a room (perhaps a ""Hudson Queen"") on the second floor that I had considered when booking because I understood that some rooms on the second floor had a walk-out garden/patio area; however, the one that I saw had just a small walk-out concrete patio without any furniture. Perhaps there are plans to put some furniture out there or to landscape each patio. Aside from its easier access to the lobby and restaurant (e.g., stairs), there would have been no benefit in choosing one of those rooms over the penhouse rooms on the 18th floor. In fact, I greatly preferred the room that we had. We did have a small walk-out balcony off of our room, and the views from there, which you could also see from the bed, were quite nice (Chrysler Bdlg, Empire State, 1 Bryant Park Tower), especially at night. If I were to return, I would request our room or the one next to it, both of which face uptown. The location of The Jade is very convenient, as there are numerous subway lines within walking distance on 14th. Taxis are great and plentiful, but I found that it was generally much faster to just use the subway. Union Square, the Meatpacking District, and Soho are all within walking distance, and there are plenty of great restaurants close by. In part, I chose this hotel due to its proximity to the L line so that it would be easy for family coming in from Brooklyn to meet us for dinner, but it was also very convenient for getting up to Columbia, The Cloisters, the theater district, etc. An area for improvement concerns the breakfast that can be included in your room rate. While the rate that I booked did not include breakfast, I did ask about it when we arrived and opted to have it included at $15 per person/day. (Murray's Bagels around the corner is another option). Apparently the restaurant and the hotel are separately operated, as each day it was a new adventure to confirm that we did have the breakfast plan, and to determine what it did or didn't cover. The hotel and the restaurant need to have a sit-down to iron this out, as it makes no sense to reinvent the wheel each day. Having said that, the breakfast itself was very good.

I've stayed at other high end hotels in NYC and across the country and the service that we received at The Jade was up there.

Check in was friendly and prompt and we were on our way to our room. Our luggage was delivered to our room within moments as well.

Water is wet, ice is cold, and if you are paying less than $500 a night in Manhattan, you will get a small room. I found the regular queen room I stayed in to be a perfectly adequate size for a single traveler, as long as you're not trying to do yoga in it or have a suite of LV trunks with you or something.Anyway, here's who the Jade Hotel is not for: families with young kids, tourists who want to be around Times Square, travelers on a budget, or those who want the range of amenities or type of glitz that only big hotels can provide. Who the Jade Hotel is for: travelers who like smaller, boutique hotels; who would prefer to stay in more of a low-key, residential neighborhood; who would rather have a bit of elegant style instead of convenience and square feet.I was very happy with my stay at the Jade. They had been open only a month, so there was a bit of construction ongoing and the staff were still settling in, but everyone was very nice and helpful. The room was comfortable--good beds, marble and ceramic baths, vaguely Deco-style furnishings--and pretty quiet (not too much ambient noise from 13th St. or from other rooms). The restaurant/bar was not open at that point, so I can't comment on that. The only thing I could quibble with is having to pay for in-room wifi, but that's a pet peeve of mine, and an admittedly minor one. The location is good for public transport; you're blocks away from almost all the major subway lines.I will definitely be staying at the Jade again.

The hotel front desk staff was extremely kind, and in particular, Briant went above and beyond his duty to make our stay memorable. He made sure a bottle of champaign and strawberries were brought out for us to celebrate, and then requested and made sure to upgrade our room for the special occasion. He certainly should be commended!The location of the Jade is quite excellent, serving a location that is void of quality hotels. Additionally, the lobby and rooms (although small even by NY standards) were decorated extremely well and the rooms were exceptionally clean. However, for over $400 a night, there are better options in the surrounding areas. They are going for a very upscale look and feel, and the amenities and space do not warrant the price.Our main problems were with the restaurant, bar, and room service. On Saturday evening, the bar manager came up behind the bartender and slapped her behind hard right in front of myself and 6 others sitting at the bar. This garnered no response, or apology from the bar manager. After spending about an hour at the bar, our tab was closed for the 7 of us and we walked to the lobby. One of our group members was on the phone when we closed the tab, he walked back into the bar, and the bartender tried to trick him into paying for the tab a second time! Luckily we heard the exchange and I ran in and stopped it from taking place. Lastly, on Sunday morning my fiance' and I ordered room service (Coffee, tea, an english muffin, and a bagel). It took room service 50 minutes to arrive with two pots of water (no coffee), the wrong tea, and no condiments for the breads (just toasted and plain). I called and explained and they returned to fix the order. Although this time, they did not bring creamer (after I specifically requested it) or the condiments again. I called again and they returned with only the condiments. After that, I gave up on creamer. Thankfully, the front desk attendant removed out charge upon checkout.Without major issues with the restaurant, bar, and room service, I would have given the hotel a 4. And without the fantastic service Briant provided, it would have been a 1 or 2. However, the restaurant, bar, and room service left a bad feeling about the hotel in general. I would consider staying here if you can get the place for a decent price, but avoid the bar & restaurant at all costs!","Nashville, Tennessee","Traveling_AGP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",68,3.0

The Jade's two big pluses are its location and decor. There are very few hotels near Union Square, but I think it's one of the best areas to stay as a tourist – close to subways to take you uptown to department stores, and also within walking distance to the cool boutiques and cafes in the Village and Nolita, galleries in Chelsea, and a short train ride away from the night life in the Lower East Side. The Art Deco interior is also a winner: stylish chrome finishes, tiled bathroom floors and Asian-inspired sliding panel to hide the flat-screen TV. I had a great view of the Empire State from my bedroom. I also appreciated the Bigelow bath amenities in the spacious bathrooms. The maid does a turn-down service, if you like that. Staff were very friendly, but service was a patchy – hopefully it smooths out soon. Minuses: Standard rooms are small (about average for NYC, though); fine for shorter stays, but you'd feel cramped if you stayed more than five days (especially if you're travelling as a couple). If you can afford it, splurge on one of the larger suites. There was a sizeable gap under my front door, so noise from the corridor/elevator travelled into my room. Not a huge problem as the hotel wasn't full, but I wouldn't want that if it was at capacity. I would stay at this hotel again, mainly for the location. I actually just tried to book it again, but prices have shot up to $390 for the weekend I want to stay, so it's out of my budget.

We usually stay in a chain with a good reputation. When our taxi driver dropped us off, he wasn't sure where the hotel was. We walked by it twice, pulling luggage behind us. There is no sign on the door or building. There is a hotel restaurant menu board outside, and I stopped to read it and realized that the hotel had a restaurant by the same name. We went inside, down the stairs to the small but stylish lobby. I checked us in and received our keys. We were on the 6th floor and waiting sometimes 5 minutes or more for the elevators. Only one of our two keys worked. I returned to desk to get the keys fixed, which she thought she did, but it happened again. The rooms are the smallest rooms I have ever seen in the city. We asked for a king bed and had to full sized beds. Just a tad bigger than a twin bed. There is a small armoire and desk chair combo. The bathroom was also small without any counter space. The room was clean, but throughout the night we kept smelling food being cooked. But, not in a pleasant way and not when you'd expect to smell food cooking. Not sure if their ventilation system from their kitchen gets pumped into the rooms but it was very strong. We paid over 450.00 a night to stay here, but it was not worth that kind of money. We have paid less at much better places in the city. This is a brand new hotel, but the hallways already show signs of aging.

Abundant subway stations are with a block or two. The rooms are very small but quite nice and the hallways can get very crowded when the cleaning staff is at work. But the staff is friendly, professional and very helpful. My only serious complaint is about the elevators. This is a very new hotel and I suspect the elevator program needs some tweaking, the waits in the lobby were interminable while two elevators would be stopped on the same floor. Our room, a double on the 10th floor, was quiet and very clean.The bathroom was tiny but very well appointed.

The only negatives about the room would be that it was indeed quite small, which for us was not a problem, but should you stay longer than two nights and wished to unpack might cause problems. The walls are paper thin... we could hear another couple talking quite clearly through the wall, which we thought was rather entertaining but others might find irritating. Lastly, some of the fixtures were a little tempramental... the toilet flush fell off the wall and one of the bedside light bulbs didn't work. However having said this when we alerted the staff of the problem they came to sort it straight away for us.We did not eat in the restaurant but the food looked great... We did have a drink in the bar which was very cosy with low lighting and a very personal feel to it, the bar tender on duty was very attentive and generous which was greatly appreciated.The location was impeccible, on a nice quiet street only a couple of minutes walk from three subway stops and the famous union square and Washing Square, lots of restaurants, shops a cinema - everything you could need really.All in all we had a really lovely stay at The Jade and I would definitely go back again should I return to New York, and have already recommended it to a friend as a stop to include on her Honeymoon.","London, United Kingdom","CobblesComments</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,4.0

I got a corporate rate from my company's travel agency. The problem is, since I paid $179 + tax per night, I probably got the tiniest room and the desk & chair were a serious problem, especially if you have to work at night after a day of meetings. My chair was touching the side of the bed when I pushed it backwards to get up and I could barely get my legs out from under the desk. As you can see from the pics I posted, the front of the desk is built in a certain way to allow your thighs to go right inside the front of a wooden board with a round top and considering that I am skinny and of average height, I spent a considerable amount of trying to get out of the desk. I ended up sitting on my bed and doing all my computer work. Good thing the bed had lots of brand new comfy pillows.Another annoying thing was I kept bumping my lower leg against the side legs of the beds. I even got purple bruises so after night #3, I found a solution by taking both cylinder pillows from the bed and putting them on the floor in front of the bed to avoid this from happening again. Problem solved.There's no space to leave your luggage open, you must close it and use all the closets and drawer space offered. I even used the area in front of the window to put books since the desk is tiny. During my night #2 to 5, I called downstairs to ask if it was possible to change to another room since I was staying for another 3 nights. Jenny from downstairs said she would call me back to let me know. Well, she never did and that's bad Customer service. I also became creative and moved the white bench that was right under the TV and in front of the bed, to the left side of my bed or it would have been impossible to walk at all. The bench is super light, actually quite cheap. I had a big cold and ordered hot water, lemon and honey almost every night. Hotel didn't charge me and I made sure to tip the waiter. However, the cup was missing from the order so I called downstairs and jenny answered the phone. She said she would send one up but nobody ever came up with the mug. I finally used the glass from the bathroom. These are tiny details that waste my time. Also, the hotel's website says that there's a business center but when I called downstairs, I was told that it wasn't ready.I checked out at 5 AM on Sun morning. At the front desk, I was given the total and so asked for a printout to read it first before having my card charged. Well, the girl there seemed reluctant and just showed me the computer screen by pointing the total. I asked her politely again that I would just like to read a hardcopy first if that's ok. Wow, she didn't smile one bit and showed her colleague (a much nicer gentleman who was new) how to print. If I were her boss, I would teach her some manner. She was probably the rudest person I encountered at the hotel.I also heard the neighbors watching TV and talking next door, but they went to bed early luckily.Only 2 elevators at this hotel and they can slow so be prepared to wait. The Plus side:Great location, near 14th St. subway and 1,2 & 3 line. lots of restaurants and Whole Foods nearbyVery friendly staff that greets you when you return everyday, always someone to open the doors for youGreat bathroom & productsFree bottled waterLots of fluffy new towelsBathrobe & slippers providedGreat productsHigh end Egyptian cotton bedsheetsSuper comfy bedVery clean (except the carpet wasn't well vacuumed)Plush pillowsTurn down service Wake-up callNo noise outside, facing another building which didn't bother meI tipped the maid every day.If you're thinking of staying here for business, get a much bigger room or you'll be 'stuck' behind the desk.

French Roast, Murray's Bagels, and Slice & Co. are all close and good.","Fresno, California","William T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fresno, California</strong>",0,5.0

The room was quiet and had a lovely view, as well as a marvelous bed after a lot day of walking. We also loved the food at the restaurant and felt like the staff really made an effort to make us feel at home and welcome.

Rooms are tastefully decorated but small, so you have to maneuver a bit around the furniture. My stay was during their soft opening so the restaurant was not available. I was visiting with other family members for a birthday celebration. Firstly it took them a while to find my sister's luggage that was left at the hotel earlier. The system or lack of one was off, so they brought up another guests luggage first. Secondly, the acoustics are terrible so you can hear everything, including the staff running through their day at 8 AM on a Sunday. Thirdly, when I checked out I asked for an email receipt, which I haven't received to date. Lastly, the bell hop was nice enough to arrange a car to the airport for my sister. He told her the fee was a flat rate of $70 including the tip. Wrong - it did not include the tip and there was a surcharge for using a credit card! I did drop a line to the hotel and to date have not heard back from them. This is a new property, so a few bumps are expected. Sadly, customer service shouldn't be one of them.","Massapequa, New York","mkaren</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Massapequa, New York</strong>",7,3.0

WORTH IT!! From the moment you step out of the Yellow Cab, there is a sense that you’ve just ‘step back in time’! Step inside and you see gold gilded walls, smoky mirrors, carved wooden ceilings, a fire place, smell of leather, plush, velvety furniture, above all huge smiles from staff and customers! Note: unbeknownst to us, it was they’re Opening Night after all! Just about everything about this hotel oozes style and elegance, WITHOUT overstatement. Definitely, first great impression!! No problems checking in (Ipads and all, also free WIFI) and staff made us feel really welcome. Gone into a small room, yet got upgraded to a much bigger room with a view of the Freedom Tower!! Gee, the design was amazing!! The Art Deco ambiance, created by the vintage (look alike/ design) furniture pieces and impressive wall paper, are beautifully set-off by the tasteful and calming décor; Tivoli Radio was a great touch!!! BED was brilliant, with two choice of pillows…surprisingly quiet area and with a comfortable bed = many a great nights rest! The design extends right through the towel presentation in a monochromatic bathroom, finished off with classic lush American Toiletries (C.O. Bigelow)!! Located at Greenwich Village Manhattan, the hotel is close to everything. 14th W Street Metro is close by and has a lot of Café’s nearby. We particularly loved hanging around O’Café (cnr of 12th St and 6th Ave) for good coffee and brekky. We ventured out for dinner, mainly Chelsea area (Pad Thai, Room Service and Koffeecake Corner) and you definitely need to try Las Ramblas (near the corner of 4th St and 6th Avenue) for tapas. We literally walked all over the place and even set off from the Hotel to discover Lower East Side area, passing through Tribeca, Soho, etc…As with any mini trips (we stayed for 5 nights here), your 'home away from home' matters a lot! The Jade Hotel Greenwich Village NYC was just the spot and more. Massive thanks and KUDOS to the management and the team (especially Brian, Carmello, Oscar, gee I can’t remember all the names, oh, you know who you are) at The Jade Hotel Greenwich Village NYC! All the best with the venture! You made our stay truly memorable.....","London, United Kingdom","romanida</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",16,5.0

The bathroom could have done with a bit of shelf space but the products are first class, the water pressure very good and the towels fluffy and plentiful. Unfortunately, the kitchen wasn't yet open, so I couldn''t rate the food experience.

The rooms are quite comparable in size to others I have stayed at in NYC but have way better high end fixtures which quite frankly belong in a much more expensive hotel. The location was awesome for a boys weekend in the City (close to some great bars and restaurants in the Village) but I expect this place will be a go-to spot for couples looking for a weekend getaway. Overall, I was very impressed with the service, cool vibe, location and value-for-money. I will definitely be going back to the Jade on future visits.","Toronto, Canada","Stevie G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",2,5.0

The hotel is relatively disguised on the block and. Felt like I was entering a private club. Mood lighting. Dark colors. Red velvet. Great setting.Everything in the place was new -- I was the first person to ever use the iron. And the room was well appointed, well designed, and cute. The problem though was it was extremely tight. As in I kept bumping into things. The bed. The desk. The luggage bench. At first I thought it might be because I was tall but remembered I'd stayed at many small rooms in NYC but none this compact. I also noticed the furniture seemed slightly smaller in size than normal -- which explained how they got all the pieces in the room. But it was still tight. Maybe if you're under 6' you won't notice but for us tall folks this will be a problem.If you can handle the tightness, it's a great place nif not, you might want to consider someplace with larger rooms.",USA,"foureyes18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",78,3.0
