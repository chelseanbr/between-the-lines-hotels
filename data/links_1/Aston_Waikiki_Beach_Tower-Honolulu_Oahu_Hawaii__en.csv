The staff (front lobby and valet) treated us like family and anticipated every need. They noticed when I ran out of laundry detergent so gave me extra packets for the following day! We loved the personal touch of water bottles and sunscreen along with beach towels that can be checked out for day trips.

The Aston Waikiki Beach Tower completely changed our feelings and we want to go back! Check-in was amazing, with a staff member personally escorting us to our condo and explaining how everything worked. On the way up, she casually mentioned that she saw we were having a special celebration so, if it was okay with us, she had upgraded our accommodation. Was it ever! We stayed on the 38th floor. The condo was large, beautiful, great amenities and had the most amazing view. We did have a couple of questions concerning the internet and tv. Maintenance came up immediately.

The staff was incredibly friendly from the front desk to the maintenance staff. Spent one week there and it was truly a great place to stay. Lots restaurants and shops within walking distance. The area is quite busy kind of like the Vegas strip without casinos. We had a full kitchen nicely equipped and actually had a good set of chefs knives. Our unit had a great soaking tub that was enjoyed each night after walks. Only disappointment was the number of homeless in the area that would cause some havoc from time to time. Last day there a couple of homeless got into a fight and one had to go to the hospital all occurred right in front of hundreds of tourists. Overall a great experience and would recommend if you can afford it.,"Cumming, Georgia","bkl58</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cumming, Georgia</strong>",4,5.0

Beach right across the road was easy to access and have a supply of free towels at the hotel was a bonus · We arrived early from a long overnight flight from Australia. We had requested an early check in prior to our arrival. Although I was aware that it is never guaranteed I have always found most hotels are accommodating and do there utmost to get you into your room earlier than normal checkin. On arrival at Aston Waikiki we were greeted by a man call Kuhlani was very unsympathetic at the fact we had been up for 24hrs and our 3 children were extremely tired. He told us that checkin time was 3pm and we would have to wait unless we wanted to upgrade to another room. Having already paid $10,000 AU we weren't happy to do that. We went off for a few hours and had some lunch and came back at about 1pm as we were hopefully he may have found us a room. Again we were greeted with a 'check in time is 3pm '. So through exhaustion we sat in the hotel foyer to wait for our room. At approximately 2pm this same man asked my husband 'by the way are you over 50 years old"". When he said yes we were told that we were eligible for a room upgrade and therefore a room actually was available. We were then taken to our room which was on a higher floor than we had booked which was great. Unfortunately at this point we were thinking our stay at the hotel was going to be disappointing. Thankfully the rest of the staff at the hotel were lovely always greeting you when you went out or returned. Even the men and ladies at the car parking desk were extremely welcoming. Again the only person that never engaged with you was the same man that had checked us in. We were lucky that we didn't have to have much interaction with this person again, but he definitely didn't seem to follow the same philosophy of the rest of the hotel staff.","Kew East, Australia","tlc2312</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kew East, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

The unit has a modern feel with nice furnishing. As a service apartment, the room gets cleaned daily and all items (towels, bathroom amenities, and laundry soap) are regularly replenished. The master's bedroom share the same balcony as the living room and has a majestic view of the ocean. Waking up every morning with a spectacular view will perk you up each day and I highly recommend getting this unit. This might cost a little bit more than a standard 2-bedroom unit but it is all worth the price. One of our most memorable night was seeing a 30-minute fireworks display right off the shoreline.

Higher floors have the best location in Waikiki to watch the beautiful sunsets. I initially called and requested units with Diamond Head view, was a bit disappointed when I was assigned a Waikiki bay view ""03"" unit on arrival, but then I realized the bay view was actually amazing at sunset, with beautiful city lights at night! Diamond head view units do not have a full bay or city view. The tower is located at the end of the shopping district, so it's not so noisy at night, and just 1-2 blocks away to the heart of the high end shopping area, with tons (yes, tons) of eateries and stores within 2-4 blocks.- the valet: I was initially a bit bothered by the valet only option, but they had the best valet staff! Very attentive, never rude or impatient, always a smile, and it never took more than a few minutes to get the car.- rooms: very clean, including the bathroom grout! Kitchen was well equipped, all have 2 bedrooms and a living room. I think because of the large influence of Japanese tourists, their bathroom has a toto toilet (you know the one that welcomes you when you enter the bathroom:) and warm seat), kitchen has a top brand rice cooker, and PS3 had only Japanese instructions!

We even use the bbq grill and cabanas on the 4th floor by the pool. They keep the grills super clean and the the hotel provides the bbq utensils as well. Checking in was quick.

The new renovations are amazing. We have come here for years and the old decor was good enough and worth the price. Now, it's another level above. I'd say 5 star level. It's almost too nice as I'm more nervous when the kids run around in the suite! There are only 4 units per floor, so it's not like staying at the Sheraton Waikiki where there are thousands of people milling around and elevator waiting (though they have a great pool for kids with slides even though it's crowded). You're not as worried about the kids running off at the pool here because it's a much smaller and private space. Also a plus, no fighting to reserve chairs or cabanas (which we've always had issues with at Sheraton, Aulani and other big hotels).

I've stayed at the hotel many times-it's definitely the best place to stay in Waikiki. I love the views! The condos are so spacious-ideal for a family or group of friends. We run the Honolulu Marathon every year and find it's the best place to stay as far as location-it's convenient to the start-the valet, Ed, always organizes our transportation to the race-via limo! We can walk to everything easily. The hotel is exceptionally clean, the housekeeping staff is fast and efficient. If you've rented a car the free parking is a major savings over all other hotels. (Wifi is free as well.)We loved the renovations! Our condo was beautiful. Furnishing and flooring are new soft colors. Kitchenware and silverware service for 6, all new. You have a coffee maker, rice maker, dishwasher and washer/dryer-all the comforts of home! There is a grocery store within walking distance, however if you have a car Safeway or Walmart are within a mile or 2. If you don't want to cook, every type of restaurant from McDonalds (downstairs) to gourmet dining is offered within a few blocks. Delivery is available from many of the restaurants.  The 4th floor is gorgeous! The public areas, pool, grill and hospitality room are so user friendly. The pool and Jacuzzi are quiet, usually only a few people using either at any given time. The gym is the best! You have every type of brand new equipment offered. On past visits I signed up for a membership at 24 Hour Fitness next door, since they've closed having a gym in the hotel is a huge savings and convenience. The beach is directly across the street. If you run, you're steps away from Kapialani Park which is perfect for runners or walkers.

Unfortunately, this staff has little to work with as this property has seen better days.Location - Easy beach access and several restaurants steps from Hotel entrance. However, the oceanfront view from our unit was a tunnel view of the beach. Couldn't see to either side. We were on 16th floor, maybe penthouse floors would offer that panoramic view.Room condition - The units was surface clean. However, the carpets were worn, dirty and stained. The furniture was quite dated and in poor condition. the appliances were literally from the 1980s and were damaged, had years of ground in dirt and were missing pieces. I didn't feel comfortable using them except to wash a few sand filled swimsuits. The cabinets were also from the 80s era but had granite countertops. ??? Very strange, but as I mentioned surface clean but don't look too closely. There was years of accumulated dirt and dust in the corners and on outlets, window sills, etc. The paint on the walls was touched up but with a paint that had a different sheen so you could see where they only painted part of each wall - just enough where you could see eye level.Air conditioning - the thermostat control was an old fashioned dial that did nothing to control the temperature. It was either on or off and when it was on it got chilly. Especially for the people sleeping on one side of each bedroom where the vent blew right you.Bedding - Beds were quite hard and uncomfortable. Not plush and inviting. The linens were thin and sparse. No blankets or comforter. One final note, our unit did not have any hot water on the day we departed. We had an early flight with a full day of travel and it was not a great way to start the day with a freezing shower at 4am.

And the bulk of that success was due to our stay at the Ashton Waikiki. I wanted to do something special for my wife, children and grandchildren (six in all). I was more concerned about them having a good time than me. From the moment we step on the property, it was first class. The high floor suite, the view, the beach across the street, the ideal location and a host of other advantages that made this a memorable experience. There were six of us and the only complaint I got was that no one wanted to leave at the end. I can go on about the amenities but you'll see for yourself. Nevertheless, I would be remorse if I didn't mention what made it special for all of us. It was the staff and it was genuine care and commitment to ensure a pleasant stay. From the house cleaning staff, desk staff to many other folks we encountered, they made us feel welcomed. So here's to Bob, Russ, Edward, Mary, Eddy, and all of you ... well done and Mahalo!

The Honolulu zoo and Waikiki Aquarium is nearby and within walking distance. We enjoyed the evening walking along Waikiki beach to the shops and restaurants in the evening but it took roughly ten minutes one way to walk to International Market place. One concern/problem that we encountered during our stay was our room key cards. Throughout our stay at the hotel, we had to swipe the key card multiple times for it to unlock the door into our room.

The staff are great, only came across one valet who needs to find himself a new job out of the service industry. Nice refrigerated scented face towels to freshen up on arrival. Rooms are slightly dated , they are not totally old fashioned by any means, but they are not quite as modern as some others. In saying that, the rooms are very clean and well maintained. Rooms are serviced daily and staff seem to do a good job. The only real negative is the price, I realise you pay a premium for location but the price seemed a bit steep for what you get. I would like to stay here on our next visit but will shop around a little to try and get a better price. We stayed on the 25th floor in a 2 bedroom Premium apartment with completely uninterrupted ocean views.

This hotel was everything we hoped for. Huge rooms, perfect location and the most gracious, attentive staff we have ever encountered in all of our travels. Free valet made hectic Waikiki easy. Rooms spotlessly clean. The only downfall was lots of construction next door which killed the quiet on the balcony during the day, but nice and peacefully quiet in the evening. Easy walk to shops and restaurants, loved Hy's Steakhouse for a special dinner. Across the street is the perfect beach, especially for kids since there is a breakwater to minimize the waves. We picked up meals locally and enjoyed lunching while admiring the view. (Try Rainbow Drive-In and get plate lunches to go) You might even have a birdie friend or two drop by to share your meal, we did. Pearl Harbor and other attractions close by.

Despite the pool, this this is the best place to stay. Note- nobody should avoid staying here as a result of the less than average pool as the beach towers make up for it in many different ways.

Though it is a partial ocean view, we could see Waikiki beach, Kalakaua Ave. and an awesome VOG filtered sunset. Yes, we could also a few of the guests in the hotel directly in front of us and, from the bedroom windows, into the rooms of the hotel directly below us.

Uggg. Honolulu traffic is no joke either. The front lobby is very bright and well appointed, and 3 ladies were on duty when we arrived. Super nice, super polite. They were aware that we were actually supposed to arrive the day before (canceled flight) and were apologetic we had so much difficulty getting to them. Check in process was very fast and we were given cool towels to refesh with.The room we got was a suite - 1 king, 2 twins, plus kitchen & living room with pull out sleeper couch. It was very nicely appointed with a lot of storage. Would be great for a family. Our hostess that checked us in actually escorted us all the way to the room and showed us a bunch of the features. Little touches like the fridge has some coconut water, reg. waters, and mango sodas.We opened the sliding doors and the breeze immediately hit us and was glorious! We left the doors open the entire time we were there except when sleeping because the noise from the road was too much for me, even 14 floors up.The view from our balcony was amazing - we ate and spent a lot of time out there planning for our next adventure. Towels are available at the desk to hed over to the beach with, and we took advantage and walked across the beach to spend some time in the water until a rain-shower drove us back inside.There are a ton of restaurants and stores within walking distance of the hotel.

Full kitchen so we could do our own breakfast of a morning which was great.

It is privately owned so the Aston service does not apply. However the Aston staff on valet parking and front desk were helpful and willing to store our luggage when we arrived about 9 am well before check-in time. It is a pity we hadn't realised that as we had paid Paradise Transport and Luggage to store the suitcases at $ 5 per bag, which they did very well, but Aston storing them would have been even better. Our daughter and her partner arrived separately and in a rental car, so having free parking for the 3 days was truly awesome, difficult to obtain in Waikiki we understand. Best points:. 1. VIEW! From 36th floor it is panoramic and we loved to sit out on the balcony( known as a lanai in Hawaii)2. 2 bedrooms , 2 bathrooms, plenty of room , we let some of our young people use our shower so it was not 2 people for one and 4 for the other. The master bedroom and bathroom have the stacked washing machine and dryer in the bathroom, and a large wardrobe with 6 beach chairs, 2 boogie boards, 6 beach towels to borrow etc.Washing powder was provided. 3. Huge dining/lounge area with 6 dining chairs, good kitchen, we cooked in. Even had a rice cooker, had dishwasher supplies etc. We found it best to drive to a Safeway but there is also a Food Pantry in walking distance for supplies which we did use once.4. Free wifi, very important, good TV etc.We did not find the condo dated at all, we found the decor very pleasant.A matter of opinion of course.5. We found the pool area fine. Yes, the pool is a bit small- on 4th floor- but it is lightly heated, there is a very hot jacuzzi/spa pool which was nice in the evening, and nice loungers . Note the pool area is mainly shaded so do any sunbathing on the beach. It also closes 9 pm so you need to get that swim in after dinner before too late.6. Free parking, as already mentioned. 7. I actually loved that it wasn't serviced because a private rental. We are all clean and tidy adults and it felt more private. It felt like a ""home away from home"" and we did not need the ""hotel"" services of bars, restaurants, maid service etc, and as a bonus with a private rental no ""resort fee"" as many people complain about in Waikiki.8. LOCATION! Over the road to the lagoon area of beach, up north a bit further past Duke statue for waves, great shopping just by walking north up Kalakaua Ave, both high end( just for looking!) and cheaper like H&M. Good choices for the whole family. Any downsides...1. Aircon rather old and a bit noisy, so we didn't use it much at night but that was ok, could leave the doors to lanai open a little which helped. 2. Beds in master( king) and 2nd bedroom ( twin, used for our son and our daughter), were good, but our older daughter and partner found the sofa bed in lounge rather creaky and uncomfortable. 3. Elevators/lifts are a bit slow, only a minor point. Think the building is 80s so no complaints really.",Auckland,"AnonymousAuckland</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland</strong>",72,5.0

The hotel is slap-bang on the Waikikki beach - the locations and views just don't get any better. However, there are a number of important points for the owners to address:1. The decor is dated and the room was very tired with worn/stained carpets, scraped/scratched walls, furniture and ornaments2. The kitchen area wasn't clean enough throughout the entire stay and actually, it needs complete replacement. Floor tiles are chipped, the dishwasher is falling-apart & worn-out and there was food splattered on cupboards from the moment we arrived3. Cleaning is also not thorough enough elsewhere with dirty extractor fans, grotty chair handles, spilled 'stuff' on the bedside tables and a dirty balcony mopped only twice in ten days complete with a coating of black dust (soot?)4. The air conditioning is not so effective, especially as the thermostat for the bedroom a/c is in the lounge!5. Turn down service is pointless: after taking a nap on our bed one afternoon it was left unmade (but had two chocolates thrown-onto it). Photos are attached showing some of these issues. These issues were brought-up with the front desk 2/3 through our stay. We were offered another room, but this seemed pointless as staff admitted all rooms are basically the same. Attention by housekeeping was also promised. Unfortunately the room was no better when we returned the following afternoon: the same marks were on both the balcony tiles and bathroom floor tiles. In fact, there was no response until the day we checked-out.The manager called us; he had been off on holiday. He apologised profusely for the lack of follow-up and for the issues raised by us. The apology was sincere. He explained that the apartments are privately owned and as such, refurbishment and replacement is down to the owners - though I don't think he offered this as an excuse, it was provided for context. He apologised too for the lack of cleanliness. We came to an agreement for compensation, but the fact is: we just wanted a clean room that reflected the price we paid. Positives are:• nice gift of champagne and chocolates for us on  arrival • great front of house staff• large rooms• very quiet hotel (no banging doors etc.) • good quality & clean linens and bedding• good-quality balcony furniture and a huge balcony• good TVs with lots of channels• massive storage wardrobe• fast, reliable WiFi.

Beware of the cheap massage flyers being handed out on the street at the front of the hotel... they slap on a load of extra charges at the end. bills sydney ( a few doors from hard rock cafe) has an amazing happy hour deal from 3-6pm. $6 cocktails and $8 pizzas. we have eaten there the last four days. the food is amazing.",,Amanda Z,3,4.0

Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is apart-hotel or condo, with only 4 apartments on each floor: 2 sections with 2 apartments served by one elevator each, no endless corridors with hundreds of rooms on each side, no endless waiting for elevators. Clean, quiet, well maintained, gorgeous views of ocean from all apartments. Beautifully decorated entrance and lobby, parking garage without extra charges, friendly and helpful staff members.Spacious apartment we occupied was on the 17-th flloor, on the corner side, with two bedrooms. Large master bedroom had on-suite bathroom, second bedroom was on a smaller side but sufficient for two twin beds, with shared bathroom outside in the corridor, two steps from bedrooms. Washer and dryer in the individual closet in the corridor. Three or four decent closets in the corridor, two closets in the master bedroom and one closet in the second bedroom. Huge living area with sleeper-sofa and armchairs, kitchen and dining area with sufficient table to sit 6 people, Balcony is long and narrow with outside furniture; local pigeons expected to be fed on the balcony, sometimes birds entered the living and dining rooms in search of bread crumbs.Lots of space in the apartment, comfortable furniture, flat screen TV in the living room and in each bedroom, toilets equipped with bidet-style sprinklers, cozy and home-like, but better than home. Swimming pool and sauna on the 4-th floor.Beach is within two steps from hotel, across Kalakaua street. Two ABS stores close by, tons of eateries all around, Food Pantry store and Shrimp Bus two blocks away, Farmers Markets within walking distance, in the Hyatt building and in King's Village. Close to the Zoo and Aquarium.Main lobby area was under repair during our stay in April, so in form of apology we were given free tickets to the Pink shuttle, and visited Ala-Moana shopping center and local Wallmart. Our grandson received a present of beach toys upon arrival, and grown ups received a present of two Aston towels upon departure.All the time we felt ourselves as welcome Visitors, not as boring Customers.

My husband and I spent 5 spectacular days in Kona and finished our trip with one night in Honolulu/Waikiki. What a disappointment! We circled the block twice to even find the poorly signed entrance and then had to take the car around the corner to valet at a sister property and paid $25 to do so. The room at the Aston Beachside is cramped with only a small pathway to move around the king bed, which is hard and lumpy with four small, flat, hard pillows. The furnishings are not only hideously ugly but very old and falling apart. The balcony railing is too low and narrow so I was afraid to even sit outside for fear of falling over it. The view was only of a neighboring building anyway so no great loss. I felt uneasy and uncomfortable the entire time I spent in the room, which amounted to about 12 hours total. The only plus I can think of for this property is that the beach is directly across the street. But that can be said for several properties along this street so spend a little more and stay at a major hotel. This was an awful end to an otherwise fabulous trip. We will never stay at an Aston again.","Las Vegas, Nevada","lonetten</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",3,1.0

It is more of a condo than a hotel. Our room was an ocean front 1 bedroom suite and it was extremely spacious. We had a kitchen with stove, oven, full fridge, microwave and even a dishwasher. Even when I left a few dishes in the sink, the maid put them all in the dishwasher and started it for us so we came back to a fully clean kitchen. There was also a stackable washer and dryer in the bathroom and they provided us with detergent so we came home with clean clothes, when does that ever happen? Speaking of the bathroom, the water pressure was way better than any hotel we've ever stayed in. We have hard pressure at home and always find it hard staying at hotels to get the shampoo and conditioner out of my long hair but not a problem here.The staff at this place were the nicest anywhere! They checked in with us to make sure we didn't need anything but we're not intrusive in any way. The concierge (all of them) were super friendly in helping us picking some good restaurants and giving us good tips on parking for the sites we wanted to visit. Everyone who works here always has a smile and definitely made us feel welcome. We want to come back just because of them! The views.......the views.....the views!!!! You see all of Waikiki plus Diamon Head monument. It was just incredible. Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying more than 2 nights in Honolulu, because the service, extra space and amenities are worth it!

What a spectacular view! The room was updated but in need of some refreshing. The kitchen and space for 3 kids ages 3,2,and 6 months to have to spread out was absolutely needed! I've never felt more relaxed with 3 kids in a hotel room than what I did staying in this hotel. It was a breeze getting to the ocean across the street and so easy to just run back up to hotel if we needed anything else. They supply beach towels at Valet desk which was nice. Also gave each child a bucket with toys for beach upon arrival. Staff was friendly although housekeeping a couple times was a little lacking. Umbrellas were there for use when it rained which was great too.Kids got to feed the fish while we waited for our bus to pick us up. Overall great hotel, nice staff-very helpful. I ordered some groceries from company that works with hotel and was delivered to room, which was great since who wants to go grocery shopping right when you get to hotel. So kids had the snacks and drinks they like, baby had food and baby water and adults had sodas and snacks and breakfast items all ready to go!PROS- View and beach proximity is fantastic. Kitchen is great to have for kids. Never waited for elevator. Spacious rooms. Everything is close proximity from dinning to ABC stores to groceries. Endless supply of laundry soap and dish soap. Fully stocked kitchen. Water bottles, coconut water and mango soda stocked in fridge when arrived. We were up high enough to barely hear the noise from streets on a Friday night it really wasn't bothersome at all even when we were out on the patio at night time. Overall everyone was willing and ready to be of service.Very fast Valet service- guys were all great and friendly. CONS- Housekeeping was hit or miss. Both Showers/Tubs have sliding doors so it makes is difficult to have kids take a bath- Mine ended up just showering because it was too hard to bath them which made them mad because they like to take baths and play for a bit. King bed was a little hard and loud (not the highest quality mattress) when you rolled over but not too bad for a nights sleep after being outside all day. Couches and chairs were comfortable but could use a good cleaning or updating. Overall this hotel is highly recommended if you have kids and are looking for that extra space and kitchen and love unobstructed views of the ocean. We will surely be staying here again when we come back! Stay in 2202 if you can, this -2 stack is further out so no obstruction of view and bedroom had ocean view with doorwall and patio too!","Phoenix, Arizona","teresanjaime</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",2,4.0

The suite however, accommodated our family of four adults with ease, but we unanimously agreed the beds were very hard. We had stayed at this property previously and found it quite noisy but I'm sure that was mainly due to the fact that it was high season (Christmas) and there was a lot of street noise. This time however, was perfectly quiet. My pet peeve with hotel bathrooms is the complete lack of ventilation - and this was no different .... no exhaust fan to remove bathroom odours and shower humidity. We loved the fact that McDonald's was at our doorstep. Perfect for grabbing a quick morning coffee and small breakfast.

Five years ago, our unit was looking a little tired, and we were glad to see that they have refreshed the living room decor.

These are all 2 bdrm condos, and, from what I understand, are owned by individuals and then managed and rented by the company. Our unit was on the 26th floor and had a beautiful beach front view. The balcony always had a beautiful breeze but the noise from the the main drag of Waikiki tended to reverberate off the walls of the balcony and was fairly loud. The decor in our condo was only midgrade and seemed overdue for replacement with older furnishings and older carpet. The carpet had some stains on it and probably should have been cleaned prior to our stay. The mattresses were very basic and hard and the hideway sofa could only be slept on by laying at right angles to the mattress. It is not meant for an adult or even a large child as the metal crossmembers prevent any type of comfortable sleep. The bathrooms are fairly nice. There is a washer and dryer in the condo which is a big help. The kitchen was very sparsely furnished with so few dishes and tools that we chose not to cook except for the most basic of meals. The dishwasher was old and the top rack could not be pulled out enough to put dishes in it. The personnel were very friendly and professional and were a big help. There was daily room service and beach towels were always available at the entrance. The office personnel were always helpful and the main entranceway was super convenient to the beach. There is wifi which is okay and a pool and hot tub which we did not use as we spent all of our swimming time at the beach. They could really benefit by installing an exercise room with some treadmills and ellipticals. The only exercise option is a health club not far way that we were told costs $15/day/guest.There are limited room options for families at Waikiki.

Unfortunately the rapidly declining Aussie dollar coincided to create the perfect storm for us as far as rates go........so are pleased that we chose the Aston Beach Towers for our stay.You will already have read posts about the awesome location, the breathtaking views and the spacious rooms on offer, so I won't go down that track other than say you won't be disappointed.What I do feel is worth noting for families like ours (H & W, 13 & 12 year olds kids) is the benefit of the full kitchen and such a large, comfortable room that allows you the space for down time in between day trips and the endless activities.To eat out in this part of the world 3 times per day for any stay over a few nights will cost you an absolute fortune, so consider paying a tad more per night to secure a condo over a hotel room, if you are in our situation it was normal for us to spend $150 - $200 (US) per meal with a drink or two.At the Aston you have it all, a premium place to stay offering excellent service and the amenities that most hotels would dream about.We will be sad to leave tomorrow and we really hope that our Maui accomodation is at the same level as this was.I totally recommend this place to stay for families.","Mooloolaba, Australia","bursta2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mooloolaba, Australia</strong>",20,5.0

The elevators make you feel you are in some odd prison as you must first swipe your card, enter your room, wait for it to tell you which letter is your elevator then wait for that one to come get you. I guess it may be more efficient since those going to the same floor will be on the same elevator but during busy times like breakfast it is crazy. While I'm on the subject of breakfast while it is included in the bill, actually they charge a extra fee for the ""free"" WiFi, Breakfast and (actually a good thing if you got kids) free movie and game rentals. They also lock you into a $27/night valet service with no option to self park unless you find your own garage. Honestly Oahu in general is the least loved by my family of the Hawaiian islands we have been to, and this place contributed to that by making us wait 2 hours for our bags to be delivered to our room causing us to miss happy hour. The Tiki restaurant in the resort is about the only bright spot of our stay (I'll tell you about that in my review of their place so as not to tie them to this lack luster review).","Harriman, Tennessee","DocMCSE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harriman, Tennessee</strong>",27,3.0

The 40-floor building looks like it was intended to be a condominium apartment structure, not a hotel. The units -- mostly 2-bedroom, a few 1-bedroom -- are amazingly spacious and well laid-out, all with large balconies facing the ocean. There are 4 units per floor and 4 elevators, so the wait time for an elevator is rarely more than a minute or so. Parking is free (almost unheard of in Waikiki) with a very efficient valet service, though the hotel's vehicle entrance can become jammed at times. The apartments are beautifully furnished, with fully-equipped kitchens and very effective dual-zone air-conditioning. The staff is pleasant and helpful, housekeeping is proficient, and public areas (e.g., pool) are very will maintained. Because the property is so very much like a condominium apartment building, there are no restaurants, gift shops, or boutiques in the hotel -- which eliminates the congestion that such establishments create. Location couldn't be better. It is totally safe, directly across the street from Waikiki Beach, and with countless excellent shops and restaurants within a 10-minute walk. The daily room charge is augmented by an additional $25 amenities fee (becoming all to common at upscale hotels), and Honolulu's taxes on hotel charges are among the nation's highest. So, this is one of the more expensive hotels in Waikiki, but I think most people would agree that you are receiving what you pay for in terms of a high-quality hotel experience.",California,"s-goldin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",12,5.0

The hotel is set back from the street so you miss the noise but you can see it all from your room if you go with partial or full ocean view. We got upgraded to full ocean view on the 18th floor and that made all the difference. The two bedroom with kitchen was huge (700 sqft). It had a large master with king and another bedroom with 2 twins. There was also a pullout in the family room which ended up being great as you could leave the patio door open and hear the ocean all night as if you were in the master. The dining/living room area was spacious and the fully-equipped (microwave, oven, stove, full-size frig plus everything you need to prepare and serve the meal) kitchen looked into both such that we could prepare food/drinks while conversing. The entire party can easily retire to the balcony overlooking Waikiki 180 degrees (we could see west to downtown Waikiki) and east toward Diamond Head. 98.5 FM for reggae on the Bose sound system rounded out the vibe.

Our 1200 sq. foot unit was wonderful, with two large bedrooms, two large bathrooms, large living/dining area and full kitchen. The location - at the quiet end of Kalakaua Ave. couldn't have been better. We had a unobstructed view of the ocean from our 19th floor unit, and saw gorgeous sunsets every night. Waikiki is just across the street, and there is a lovely man-made lagoon for wading or swimming. You are only 2 or 3 blocks from the famous old hotels like the Royal Hawaiian, and great shops and restaurants are just a few steps away. Highway access is quite close. The staff bring your rental car in a flash. At the end of your stay, you're given monogrammed beach towels as souvenirs. Although the building is 30 years old, and a little tired as others have commented, it is a great place to stay. Icing on the cake is the free Hawaiian music and dance show given at the park just across the street most nights.","Oakville, Canada","NOJBrown</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakville, Canada</strong>",64,4.0

We were a family of 4 and wanted to finish our trip with a high end stay right in the heart of Waikiki. We were prepared to pay that little extra to ensure we had a great place in a central location. We were not disappointed. The staff at check-in were excellent and even escorted us to our suite on the 29th floor to show us through to make sure we were happy with the room. There was a supply of cold drinks in the fridge waiting for our arrival. After our drink we moved to the balcony What a view !!, We had a breathtaking panoramic landscape from Waikiki to Diamond Head which you never got tired of. Sunsets were spectacular They also have an evening turn down service where they offer clean towels and and a small snack. But the real bonus for staying here was the location. The longest part of the journey to the beach was the elevator ride. You at that close, directly across the road from the main Waikiki beach and you can pick up complimentary beach towels as you walk past the concierge desk who were always helpful. One morning the local area encountered a power failure and we had to walk down 29 floors to hit the beach and when we arrived at the bottom, the staff handed us cool flannels and a bottle of water. Just a small offer but greatly appreciated and demonstrates a level of customer service you can expect when staying here. We could not fault our stay here and would definitely recommend this as quality place to stay. On a side note we visited Honolulu about 7 years ago and experienced some excellent shopping at Ala Moana but were very disappointed this time.

I use Hotels.com to book my stays and this hotel is usually priced in the low $120/night. You don't get a beachview room for that price, but then who needs that on a business trip? Like most of the hotels in the area, the staff are very friendly and attentive. I only give this hotel a 3-circle rating as the rooms are dated, though management is making good efforts to improve this with new flat-screen tvs in some rooms and updated finishes. However, don't expect plugs for your electronics to be working all the time. They are so worn that they sometimes don't hold the plug very well.

We booked a Premium Oceanfront 2-bedroom suite and we ended up on the 32nd floor. Check in was quick and easy and the staff on the front desk very pleasant and helpful. We were shown up to our room and were immediately blown away by the views from the lanai. They were incredible!The suite itself was very spacious. The main bedroom had a king bed, with a massive walk-through robe and ensuite bathroom. The second bedroom had twin beds with plenty of wardrobe space and a TV. There was a main bathroom, full kitchen and large dining/lounge area. The lanai was a great size and ran across the lounge area and main bedroom.The suite was very clean, although we found the previous guest’s leftovers in the fridge when we arrived. However, that was quickly taken care of. The bathrooms were quite out-dated and the showers were both over the baths, which may pose an access problem for some. The showers were also very slow to drain.We loved having all the extra room and the full-sized fridge to store our supplies. We did not cook any meals, but having the oven to heat pizzas on the first night was very handy.Our kids were given squirty pool toys upon check-in and they had great fun using them in the pool. We were a little worried before we arrived as we were told the pool would be closed during our stay. However, this was not the case and we enjoyed having the easy option of a quick swim in the pool after our days out and about.My kids also celebrated their birthday the day before we arrived and once the front desk staff knew this, chocolates and sparkling cider were delivered to our room. It was a lovely surprise when we got back to our room.We had a rental car the entire time and found the valet parking easy and convenient. It only took a few moments for the guys to retrieve our car and they were always pleasant and helpful.  The location of the Beach Tower is great as many a reviewer has previously mentioned. We loved being able to walk out of the hotel and be surrounded by shops, restaurants and the beach across the road. There were always many people around at all times of the day and night, but our room was very quiet. In fact, we heard no noise from any of the other rooms surrounding us at all. It’s always a plus when you don’t have to listen to the plumbing from the room above!So, all in all, a wonderful stay at the Beach Tower on our first family trip to Hawaii.

I need a larger room than the normal hotel room and saw this hotel on TripAdvisor. I booked through Priceline not knowing what to expect but knowing that Waikiki hotel rooms on the average are small and not cheap if you want to be close to the beach. Well, this place is right accross the strreet from the Beach. When i arrived I was met by Ed at the Valet/Belldesk. Ed was a true professional and asked If i was checking-in and as soon as i said yes he knew who i was and addressed me by my name. IMPRESSIVE. How many hotels have people that look out for incoming guests and study thier names in preparation? That maybe common for the high rollers and rockstars but i'm far from anything like that. Next, Ed unloaded our Mini Van and escorted us to the Front Desk where we were welcomed by Mary with cold towels and our keys. The check-in was so easy and quick it because Mary had everything ready for us presumably before we arrived. At this point I was very impressed with this place but it got better, normally hotels give you the keys and send you on your way, not here. Mary escorted us to our room and personally showed us around, how to use the safe/washing machine/ and sliding doors and everything you can think of. In fact throughout our stay Mary checked on us to see if we were okay, helped us out with booking a Luau, and made my kids very happy regularly.The rooms here are big, we had a two bedroom, two-bathroom. This room can easliy accomodate six people easy since the living room couch folds out into a sofa bed. I found out that not all rooms ewere exactly the same but I can honestly tell you that there are no bad rooms here at this property. The views, the maintence of the property, and the staff are top notch. The guys at the Valet are so helpful, they can give you directions and also give you some really good dining suggestions. They have a suggestion for any budget or taste. They proved that to me over and over. Thank You Ed and Eddy!!!!Lastly, I have read a number of reviews of this place and if you have complaints about this place theres no helping you. Sure you can try and look for things to complain about and you might find something, it thats you, stay home.

The main shopping street right out the front. To get here from the airport we just hired a taxi van (fitted 5 people plus 3 large bags and 3 smaller bags) very easy to get at the airport.The decor reminds me of many of the Queensland hotels - cane chairs etc. The apartments are not brand new flashy but very big and roomy with an awesome view.There are plenty of restaurants very nearby - eggs and things very popular, mcdonalds at the base of the hotel but many more on the beach walk.I posted this because there weren't many reviews for people with 3 children when we were planning so I give this hotel the VERY big tick for a family of 5.

First, it was very difficult to find since the walk-in entrance is in between Eggs & Things and McDonald's restaurants, but no property sign to easily see. And, what is also confusing is that there is another Aston Waikiki Beach Hotel (not Tower) just down Kalapaua, so we kept going there by mistake. After several attempts, we finally figured out the drive-in entrance is on a small alley right after McDonald's between construction scaffolds.Then, after checking in, we learned that construction on the outside of our tower meant we could not use the lanai's as they locked the sliding glass doors. We were never told this in advance of checking in and we booked this place six months earlier, so had we known about this, we probably would have gone elsewhere. After all, we paid good money for the beautiful Waikiki view, but had to settle to look through the glass. At least they compensated us by giving us a two-bedroom instead of one-bedroom, so that helped a bit.The actual room is great with beautiful updated fully-equipped kitchen and Japanese toilets. The pool is modest and no one was there when I peeked as it was in the shade at the time. But, you can just walk across the street and go into effectively a salt water pool with the water breaks on the beach here. It is an easy walk to the zoo on one side and down by the various retain malls on the other side.Service was also excellent with room service twice per day. I would have rated a 5, except for the poor communication regarding construction and lack of lanai access.",San Jose,"Gary O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose</strong>",14,3.0

The best part of the hotel is its location. The staff was friendly and on the last day, they let us use their beach towels and bathroom even after we checked out (since we had a late flight). I would not recommend staying here if you plan to spend a lot of time on hotel premises such as the pool because there are plenty of other hotels with better pool/amenities.

If location to Waikiki beach is what you are looking for then this is the place. The view of the beach and Waikiki is beautiful. Check in was smooth we even had one of the staff show us where everything was and how everything worked in our room. Staff were also very friendly and helpful and greeted us each time we went out or came back. Beach towels were available downstairs as well as beach umbrellas. Housekeeping came twice a day to clean and at night turn our beds down and left treats on bedside table. The place is a little old and could do with a upgrade, eg the shower was over the bath and had trouble turning it on each day. We found the beds very uncomfortable and the pillows just way to soft. TV's needed updating and the furniture was old and not very comfortable. Because two bedrooms units that are close to the beach are hard to find in Waikiki this was the main reason we chose this place. Next time would look for something a little more modern.","Melbourne, Australia","AussieGirls4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",22,4.0

Most of the time was spent in 5 star hotels. I try to visit Hawaii annually as quite honestly I love the place. I had always been impressed by the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower due to its excellent position opposite Waikiki Beach and right in the middle of the restaurant and shopping precinct. On my last trip I decided to spend a few nights there and check out the differences between Waikiki apartment living and 5 star hotels. The check in process was as we expected from any 5 star hotel and it was very pleasant to be escorted to our room by an Assistant Manager who pointed out the features of the apartment. Our two bedroom apartment had a large lounge dining area that led on to a very spacious balcony complete with outdoor furniture. The fully fitted out kitchen boasted a full size refrigerator, dishwasher, microwave, oven and cooktop plus many other culinary accessories. The drawers were stocked with plates, glasses, pots & pans, cutlery and all the utensils necessary. Although my wife and I don’t do much cooking while on vacation, it was very pleasant to be able to stock up the fridge with breakfast and snack items. An excellent washing machine, clothes dryer and iron proved to be very handy. The bathroom had all the facilities and to our delight had the wonderful Japanese style toilet with the built in bidet and seat warmer.The ever present ABC convenience store that seems to stock everything, was next door and a full sized supermarket was in the block behind.There was a pool area which we did not use as the beach was a thirty second walk across the road.Staff were very helpful and explained how to use the free internet and cable HBO movie box. The apartment was serviced twice daily and was spotlessly clean. Although there were only two of us, these extremely large apartments would be most suitable for families, as extra bedding can be provided if required for larger families. The extremely big TVs in the lounge and bedrooms, especially with their cable capability, was a big plus to me. For the cost of staying at a 5 star hotel in a single room, one may enjoy the pleasures of spacious apartment living with all it has to offer. The views overlooking Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head were exceptional and I certainly look forward to staying at this apartment hotel again in the near future.I give this property a five star rating.John Pond","Sydney, Australia","johnpond</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",86,5.0

Taxi was $42 from the airport and we had a two room apartment that slept the two boys in one room, us in the other and my daughter on the fold out couch. The apartments are older and haven't been re-furbed for a while but there is nothing to complain about. Kitchen facilities perfect for an easy meal and we went out to Safeway to buy groceries for breakfast and lunches. The location is perfect and across the road from the beach so you can let the kids roam. Rental cars are a 5 minute walk away and you can rent from Alamo/Enterprise for around $70 per day. Our apartment had a car park included so I rented an SUV for 3 days and we drove to Haumana Bay [20 mins?] and snorkled there for half a day. Note - rent snorkling gear in Waikiki for a couple of dollars and take it with you - saves spending $12 a set out there. Reserve a car in advance since when the Jap tour buses hit town - there are queues out the door...The next day we looped the island and did the prawns [average] and Dole Pineapple place [no yearning to learn about pineapple so didn't bother going in... just ate the ice cream] all in a very easy day. If you are renting your car, do it only until 6pm as you will probably get it back to them in time and if you don't you can extend easily. Also, pay for your fuel as you go rather than opt for the pre-purchased fuel. The island is small and you can lap it on half a tank easily.","Auckland, New Zealand","S B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",133,5.0

Throughout our stay the staff were extremely helpful in finding activities, booking tours and directions to different places on the island. If there was a problem with anything the maintenance staff were there within 10 minutes to fix any issue we had. Although the pool was closed this gave us a great opportunity to ensure we used the beach to its full potential and being right across the road was so easy to walk across at any time. The towels were provided for the beach by the hotel and we were able to take then anywhere on the island.

A few friends were looking for a place to stay in Waikiki for a coworker's bachelor party. The party itself was taking place elsewhere but we didn't want to have to drive after and we wanted a place we could hang out for a little while before heading out. The price and size of the room seemed so much better of a value than anywhere else I could find. They're undergoing renovations so I'm not sure if the price has been adjusted to reflect that, but may have contributed to scoring a good deal. We booked a 2 bedroom premium suite. On the comments of the booking form, I mentioned we were there for a bachelor party, and if at all possible (depending on their occupancy) to place us in an area away from other guests in the event we got loud (just as a precaution!)When we arrived, they were unable to provide a room with lanai access. There were warnings posted on the website that this may be likely, so we opted to upgrade to the 2 bedroom penthouse. As far as I know, it is identical to the 2 bedroom premium suite, just located on the top floors above the premium suites. The upgrade charge was reasonable, and after settling the bill, we were escorted to the room by a friendly girl from the front desk. She showed us the room- amazing lanai, gorgeous ocean views, and even great views of Waikiki, downtown and the mountains through the bedroom windows. We reiterated we were there for a bachelor party but wouldn't be on property for most of the night. She left, we cracked open a beer, and then our phone rang. She had told the manager we were there for a bachelor party (fine, we told her and I also mentioned it in the booking form comments). She said we would need to keep the noise down after 10 or they'd have to shut us down, and we said no problem, we're not going to be here until late to sleep. A few minutes later, we got another call, telling us because we had upgraded to the penthouse, there needed to be an additional $500 hold on the room. WHAT??? We had just signed all the paperwork and talked about charges, taxes, amenities, etc and then been shown our room. And now that they had identified we were going to be a bachelor party, they freaked out and added a hold. I felt this was extremely unprofessional. If there had really been an issue, it should have been addressed at the desk. A $500 hold because it was on a higher floor than our other room? A room we had paid an upgrade fee just to stay in? I was furious, and had I been the one who spoke with the manager on the phone when he told us he was just going to put the hold through anyways, I likely would have told him to shove it and left. Alas, we stayed (sort of, 2 of the 4 guys decided not to sleep there after all), they added the hold (which finally left my account 8 days after we checked out) and that was it. It's too bad, because most of us live here or are stationed here and often look for places to stay in Waikiki for special occasions where we want to be smart and not drive after drinking. This property is never going to be on that list again.","Las Vegas, Nevada","ringmaster_d</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",28,3.0

I believe all the rooms have two bedrooms plus living room, kitchen and two bathrooms. It was pretty much the same price as two regular hotel rooms but much much more spacious. It slept the six of us comfortably with two kids on a sofa bed. Exterior of hotels is under minor renovations - the staff were very anxious that this didn't impact us and upgraded the location our room, gave us free towels to keep, toys for kids etc but the renovations only meant we could go on the balcony (not a big deal since I have a slight fear of heights and never use balconies). Great location on the beach. Although it is a big tower it has a low density of visitors since the rooms are so large - this is great since there is no wait for lift and the lobby is calm.

On New Years Eve we could see all the fireworks from our balcony, and some people were on their surfboards in the ocean watching them.

The views are simply lovely and worth the extra bit you pay for them.The pool and spa were being reconditioned during our stay but with Waikiki beach just across the road this didn't bother us. We also loved being across from the sectioned beach-pool areas which are great for young families and early morning paddle boarders alike.We used our spacious and well furnished lanai several times every day. It's a wonderful spot to relax and take in sounds of the ocean and the sights on the streets below. One sport we loved was watching the comings and goings of planes (don't worry, the noise was minimal if at all) and also spying cruiseships entering and leaving Honolulu harbour.We were in town at the same time as the Pro Bowl on this trip (unplanned) and were lucky enough to walk thorugh the block party happening along Kalakaua Avenue. With all the bands and people around we wondered if the noise would carry to our balcony. It didn't bother us at all as some music was present but not loud, in fact we had a great time watching all the goings on from there until they packed everything up shortly after midnight.The beds were very comfortable for our family group of 3 adults and 1 child. The kitchen contained everything we could ever need from cutlery and crockery to salt and pepper (how cool!) and coffee, the latter being replenished daily if required. The turn down service at night was an added bonus with towels changed and a delicious little snack provided too. The housekeeping staff have a good eye for detail and our unit was always very clean and well provisioned. We didn't need to ask for anything in this department but I am sure if we did, it would have been provided promptly and with a smile, as with everything else!The staff were wonderful and ever helpful, even calling our airline for us to organise things when we needed some help. A special shout out to Yasu and Russ who really looked after us during our stay. You guys made us feel so welcome and always greeted us with a warm and genuine smile. Thank you!!We had a car for a couple of days during our stay and the complimentary valet parking was fabulous! For those reading and wondering what the catch is... there is none. It's convenient and on the premises so no need to wait for ages to have your vehicle delivered.Location wise, this building is located at the eastern end of the strip. Still close enough to be a short walk to anything but far enough away for those who don't like to be in the thick of it all. We actually prefer to be in the thick of it and were concerned that this might be a bit out of the way but we loved the location.There is a Waikiki Trolley stop just across the road and buses out the front and to the street behind, depending on where you are headed. Nothing is too far away. There are also a number of ABC stores of various sizes very close by for grabbing your supplies.For groceries, there is a supermarket not too far a walk from the hotel on Kuhio Avenue (one street behind and a couple of short blocks along) for a larger shop.Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed out stay here and although the building is not new and there are some signs of wear and tear, the condos are well furnished and appointed, clean and very spacious.

The accommodation was massive; we could happily have lived there, 2 beds, 2 baths, lounge, dining area and modern well equipped kitchen. The hotel is having some renovation which we knew when booking so access to lanai's was restricted. This didn't impair the fabulous view though and we experienced no building noise as work was scheduled to start after 10am when residents had left and end prior to 4pm. The standout for us was how genuinely happy and accommodating all of that staff are at this hotel. The concierge desk, housekeeping and the reservations team really went out of their way to make sure everything was perfect.

We found out ahead of time about the renovations, so were prepared as the notices said lanai access might not be available. Our first room, the 2BR premium ocean view, we had no problem. This hotel is in a great location across the street from Waikiki. The rooms themselves could use a little renovation (in addition to the outside work they are doing). Nothing major, just starting to look a little tired. This room had some really old TVs (like 10 years minimum), which isn't great for that early Sunday football watching. What really stands out about this place though, is the staff. Everyone works super hard to make sure your stay is fantastic. I wish I wrote down names, but from the desk, to valets, to housekeeping (extra towels? No problem. Supplies? no problem), everyone seemed to bend over backwards to help. The lack of pool access isn't a problem, unless you absolutely have to have a pool. This one isn't that big anyway, and there isn't much at the pool level other than that pool and a deck. I'd rather be on the beach anyway. Concierge helped with some golf reservations, beach towels were plenty. The second time we stayed, we requested a late checkout, as we were flying back in the evening. The staff juggled some things, so we got a partial ocean view with restricted lanai access because of the outside work, but we got the late checkout we wanted, with no extra charge. It was almost like getting another day of vacation. Again, the staff at the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower is as good as any place I've stayed, any where. I would absolutely come back here again (hopefully I will get a chance).","Portland, Maine","Membermaine07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Maine</strong>",51,5.0

We had booked a ""2BR partial ocean view room"" and must have been upgraded to a ""2BR Premium Ocean View Room"" as we were on the 32nd floor with views to die for (Diamond Head to Ala Moana). The furnishings were modern, super luxurious and the whole experience was incredible. So........ when planning my 60th Birthday trip with husband, 2 brothers and 2 sisters-in-law, I recommended we stay at the same property. I booked back in March 2013 - a 2BR Deluxe Ocean View plus a 1BR Deluxe Ocean View and requested the ""highest floor possible"". One week prior to arriving we were contacted by our Travel Agent to inform us that the hotel would be undergoing renovations on the outside only, which should not cause any disruption to our stay. They stated that the renos ""may"" mean that we might be in a room without access to our lanai. While I wasn't very happy, it was too late to find an alternative property. However, upon arrival, we were then informed that we would not be able to use either the pool or the jacuzzi during our stay! While the Aston staff insisted that they had notified Wholesalers and Agents of the renovations back in September, we were certainly not advised until November about the renos and certainly not about the closure of the pool. Well, we were already there - what could we do? Then came the disappointment of the rooms! While we had requested (back in March) for a ""highest floor possible"", we found ourselves on the 12th floor, with a little view of the ocean directly in front of our lanai, but mostly overlooking the rooftops of the buildings on both sides and putting up with the noise of the air conditioners on top of the Pacific Beach Hotel next door. We did however have a great view into the Rooms of the Aston Circle Hotel in front of us! It was entertaining watching what other travellers get up to after dark with lights on and curtains open! The furnishings in both rooms were dated, tired and in need of a good re-furb. Coffee tables, chairs and TV cabinet all needed a coat of varnish, and the TVs were all the old tube-type. Not a flat screen to be seen. Needless to say, after the incredible experience of my first visit in 2009, I was disappointed and embarassed that I had recommended this property so highly to my family. There was no apology from Management, no offer of change of room, and certainly no offer of a partial refund for the inconvenience of no pool. I guess I equate it to paying a premium price for a dozen large free-range eggs, only to discover I'd only been given 10 cage-raised small eggs for the same price! In fact, I feel like I've been ripped off!","Adelaide, Australia","pat-shops-a-lot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",8,3.0

The location was great because we weren't down in the very crowded shopping district and the beach access was great with actual shoreline which isn't the case for a lot of hotels on the beach. The condo was huge; we were traveling with two teenagers and one used the bedroom and our other teen used the pullout in the living room. We did not use the kitchen to cook but it is nice to be able to store your snacks, drinks and food with full size appliances. We shopped at an ABC and kept snacks, drinks, and other food which saved on restuarant spending in between meals. Having the washer and dryer was great because we were able to wash a few loads of clothes. The hotel replaced detergent each day and they don't charge you. The patio wasn't a little dinky balcony, it is a real patio with full size furniture and fabulous views (I think all,of the units face the ocean). We really didn't need to buy anything for the beach; the hotel gives you towels, umbrellas, or whatever they have in storage you can use and bring back. The hotel itself is not crowded with people (waiting on elevators, etc) and very laid back. The staff was very courteous and friendly. If you are traveling with kids or other family members and don't want to be stepping over your luggage and belongings in a cramped hotel room, it is worth the extra cost to stay in a condo!

We were in room 801 and had a fabulous view of the beach. There are so many wonderful things about this hotel:PROS:-Location location location: perfect spot for heading to the beach, restaurants, shopping, even their walkway out to the beach is beautiful-Condo accommodations: We had 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a sofa bed which worked perfectly for our family. It's a huge benefit to be able to cook meals and do laundry in your own room, no waiting in a stuffy laundry room. -Turndown service: Every night a housekeeper would come by the room and ask if we needed any anything at all from extra towels to laundry soap, and would leave us a little goody to eat. The kids loved seeing what the treat would be.-VALET: YES the Valet service is THAT good!! They were so welcoming, they knew our name even as we pulled in to check in, we had stopped at Costco on the way in for some needed grocery items, and they said hop out of the car, go enjoy and they brought not only the luggage but all of our groceries to the room. And not having to worry about parking was a wonderful perk!CONS: I had to get really nitpicky to find anything worth complaining about, so here goes, yes the building is older, some wear and tear is evident in places, but overall a very well kept property.The pool is very small and offers no shade, we attempted the pool only once and it was a tad chilly for the kids, but wanted to give it a try at least. However, we did not go to swim in a pool, we were there for the ocean so this didn't bother us at all. Overall, the beds were comfortable, the furnishings were pleasant, loved that the elevator only serviced 2 rooms on each floor, and the elevator is fast! The lobby had a very pleasant smell walking in, and there were the most beautiful flower arrangements inside. The koi pond in the valet area made the kids happy as well. We could tell you all the reasons we loved our stay at the Aston, but you should really experience it yourselves!!

For families, it is right across the road from a sheltered beach area great for little ones to swim without the waves knocking them over. One catch to watch out for is that if you book through an independent owner, there is no reception support and you will need to let others know travelling with you of your telephone number as reception will have no record of you, or be able to attend to your needs. The 2 bedroom/bathroom apartments are well appointed, clean, but the building is old and in need of repair.

Our second day we had a slight problem with the a/c but once reported, it was immediately repaired. I really cannot say enough good things about the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower!! This hotel is all condos, so there's no restaurant on sight, but there are a number of great restaurants, casual eateries and shops within short walking distance of the hotel, plus lots of ABC stores near by!! There's a breakfast place and a McDonald's right next door (McDonald's was temporarily closed due to remodeling during our visit), and there is a small bakery, barbeque place, and ice cream shop adjacent to the hotel. The hotel has a small swimming pool and a jacuzzi/hot tub on the 4th floor, but Waikiki Beach is directly across the street, literally just a few steps away from the hotel entrance, so who needs a swimming pool!. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower to friends and family visiting Oahu. If you get an ocean view room on the higher floors (above floor 15), you will have the best views, but I think any of the ocean view units would have a nice view of Waikiki Beach.",Sacramento,"ModernGigi2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sacramento</strong>",26,5.0

We upgraded to ocean front rooms. The rooms were clean, which is my top priority when it comes to choosing a hotel. The fully stocked kitchen and washer dryer were a necessity for my large family. Housekeeping came every day to clean and every night to turn down the beds and leave a treat, and they were very generous with coffee, laundry detergent, soaps, etc. The whole staff was so friendly and helpful, everyone greeting us with an Aloha. The lobby is really small, but they have a nice outdoor seating area in the open walkway. The only downer was that the McDonald’s adjacent to the hotel is under construction, so part of the walkway was boarded off. Otherwise, it would have been a beautiful walkway with the flowers hanging down and view of the beach, great for photo ops.  We basically had the whole floor to ourselves, which was great so we could keep all of our doors ajar and the kids could wander from room to room. We had the -04 room (6 people) which had a great layout and a great view of Diamond Head from the kitchen, master bed and bath, full ocean views from the living room and kitchen and beautiful city view from both bedrooms. The views from every window were spectacular. There is nothing like waking up first thing in the morning and having your breath taken away with a beautiful view of the ocean as you enjoy a cup of coffee on the lanai, then looking out toward Diamond Head as you wash up the dishes from breakfast! My sister and her family (5 people) were in the -03 room which also had a great layout. It was the most open, so this was where we convened most of the time. The back window opened to the breezeway, so I think she kept it shuttered the whole time for privacy purposes, and the bathrooms didn’t have any windows. The second bathroom here was much bigger than the second bathroom in our unit. The view from the lanai was SO beautiful, as it offered full panoramic views of the beach and ocean. My brother’s family and my parents were in the -01 unit (6 people). The layout of this particular room was a little odd, somewhat closed off, but it offered more privacy to those who were sleeping on the pull out couch. It was also the only room who could sleep with all of the windows open without fear of all of their belongings blowing away during the night. It also had a full ocean view with great views of Waikiki.  The location is great…steps from the beach, shopping and restaurants. We walked to and from dinner every night, which was great for the adults enjoying tropical drinks and fun for the kids to get a chance to get a glimpse of tame city nightlife. Going out shopping after dinner was fun too, as most of the shops nearby are open until 11pm or later. There is an ABC store right downstairs, a food pantry within walking distance and Sam’s Club/Walmart was a very short drive away. It had relatively easy access to the freeway, which made driving around the island painless. The location is right across from the beach. Kalakaua Ave. is very pedestrian friendly, so getting from our room to the beach was a piece of cake (even with 9 kids in tow). I highly recommend this hotel to families traveling to Oahu!","Fresno, California","Erin M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fresno, California</strong>",11,5.0

Hotel staff was very friendly. The beach area directly in front of the hotel is ok - typically crowded and a bit dingy looking water. Lots of surfers farther out though.

You are just minutes away by foot from restaurants and gifts shops, and just seconds away from the beach. There is a bus stop across the street, a trolley stop and the free shuttle to Hilo Hattie. We were able to get the bus from the airport to Waikiki, and walk just two blocks to the hotel. The entrance is very low key, and if you weren’t paying attention, you might even miss it. You walk under a trellised archway to the lobby, which is smart if nothing special. Check-in – Upon check-in, all our paper work was smoothly processed, with the utmost civility. We had a couple of questions, which the receptionist answered fully. She even then showed us to the room, and walked us round all the amenities. They had left us a bottle of champagne and a box of Godiva chocolates for the Hawaii 50/senior citizen special offer – very classy. We had a question about the password for the WiFi, and although it was written on the side of the modem, because it was not on a card on the desk where it should be, within 5 minutes a card with the correct details was brought to the room. Room – We decided to go for the full ocean view, and it is worth the extra! We were on the 32nd floor, so although you are not directly on the beach, you have a complete and unobstructed view of the ocean, and to the left, a nice view of Diamond Head. We spent a lot of time on the lanai, which had 4 chairs, a table, foot stool and lounger. If you don’t want to eat out every night, then this room has a fully fitted kitchen, with large oven, fridge/freezer and all the cooking equipment you might need. It even has a dishwasher. This unit had two bedrooms, both with TVs, and the master bedroom with sliding doors out on to the lanai. The living room had a very comfortable sofa, and one the most high-tech and largest TVs I’ve ever seen in a hotel room! Nice cable line-up and a lot of HD channels, as well as a DVD player. Coffee maker with tea and coffee restocked daily and even cookies during turn down. Shower was roomy and came with nice high-end selection of toiletries. There is a safe in the closet, big enough for a laptop. Restaurant – No restaurant in the hotel, but there is in room dining. But there are so many restaurants within a short walk that this is not something you will miss. Amenities – Has some of the amenities you would expect, but no fitness center or business center. However, if you needed something printed out, I’m sure the staff would be more than happy to do it. I didn’t find that I missed a particular amenity during our stay. Check-out – Check out was their usual courteous standard, and was accurate and efficient. They asked if we needed a taxi or any help with our luggage. The staff is very focused on detail, which I appreciated. Pay the extra for the full ocean view, you won’t regret it! The staff is some of the most courteous and helpful that I have ever encountered at a hotel. The March 26th review, I have to totally disagree with – she must have stayed at a different place, or have excessively high standards. Much as I have loved staying at some of the hotels right on the beach in the past, it would be hard to stay somewhere else again next time I am in Waikiki.","Rochester, NY","UJ99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester, NY</strong>",40,5.0

To start with, let us say that this condominium resort’s clientele appears to consist mostly of demanding Japanese tourist, which may explain much of what follows… The location, right on the best part of the beautiful Waikiki beach, can’t be beaten. The staff, consisting mostly of incredibly polite and friendly Japanese women, is absolutely first class. But the real shock is when you enter the apartment and realize its size, the high quality of the materials, furniture and equipment, and when you discover the amazing view of the turquoise Pacific Ocean shining through the huge glass doors of the terrace. I estimated the whole apartment (# 2301) to be approximately 200 square meters including a 30 square meters terrace. It had obviously been recently renovated and had two bedrooms and two bathrooms, and the best equipped kitchen one can imagine, with high end oven and microwave oven, dishwasher, rice cooker, coffee maker, a huge fridge including ice maker etc… A huge flat screen TV, DVD player and a Bose sound system in the living room and in each of the bedrooms. A washer and dryer and of course a safe and perfectly working A/C... as well as the curious Japanese WCs with control panel! The room had breathtaking views on 3 sides: the Ocean and Waikiki beach on the front terrace, Diamond Head through the living room and master bedroom side windows, and the mountains from the two bedroom windows at the rear. The room is serviced twice a day, and cleanliness leaves nothing to be desired. No doubt this is one of the most beautiful placed I ever stayed; I wish I could live there! Just a warning, in order to fully enjoy this property you certainly need to be in one of the upper floors (I would say 20th story or higher) or else views may be blocked by adjacent buildings and street noise may be an issue.","Luxembourg City, Luxembourg","Lablanche</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Luxembourg City, Luxembourg</strong>",236,5.0

Nothing was too much trouble and they provided good advice on rental vehicles and restaurants.Everything was in walking distance with the beach across the road, an ABC store downstairs and restaurants and shopping just up the road in walking distance. We hired a vehicle for 2 days to see the North Shore and the beaches on the eastern sideThe apartment block is old style and dated however the position and the service provided are the big winners here.

I wanted to share a few things about our experience with this hotel so that others don't show up for their reservations and are surprised like we were. The website is very very deceiving. The hotel is very run down and needs some re-decorating in a bad way. As we pulled into the parking garage and walk into the lobby, I burst into tears. I couldn't believe the pictures I saw online were the same hotel I was standing in. The lobby was freezing cold, poorly decorated and had an odd smell like a public bathroom. I looked at my husband and said ""You've got to be kidding me! I am not staying here if the rooms look anything like the lobby"". The receptionist took us to the 2 bedroom condo we had reservations for and OMG I lost it. It looked like a retirement home's room, NOTHING like the 2 bedroom room shown on the virtual tour on their website. They then told me that the room had just been renovated. Really!?! WOW! We went back downstairs where the receptionist got her manager and went back upstairs to see another 2 bedroom room. Now this one looked just like the one on the website. I am then told ""well this one is the ocean view room and is actually more money, but we will go ahead and upgrade you to make your stay enjoyable"" I was very very happy about this. However, nowhere on the website does it state that the 2 bedroom room on the virtual tour is only pictures of the ocean view room. (Funny how I just went to look at there website and it now has written under the photos ""deluxe ocean view"" under the images that didn't show that previously. They must have listened when I said they needed to update their info. The partial ocean view room looks NOTHING like the one on the virtual tour. The ocean view is amazing and worth the extra money. If you plan to visit this hotel or any hotel on the same street or by this hotel, I strongly encourage you to find a hotel on another street. There is construction going on right in front of this hotel that starts at 6:30 am every day but Sunday. It is very loud and wakes you up.I will list the pros and cons of this hotel to help you make your own decisions on how you feel about this hotel. I have very high standards for hotels and the only thing that this hotel had that was wonderful was the staff and service.CONS~ No restaurant in hotel No gift shop or snack shop to grab something to eatNo Room ServicePool area has no shade and is very smallPool area closes at 9pmPROS~Directly across the street from the beachWalking distance to many shops, several ABC stores and restaurants Spacious and very clean roomsComfortable bedsGreat customer service and staff","Temecula, California","Jen H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Temecula, California</strong>",39,3.0

Front desk was always friendly and helpful. Bell staff especially Ed and Eddy were terrific and always offered great advice on places to see and eat. Nice to have valet parking as the streets are packed and parking is a premium. We rented a mini-van and it came in very handy traveling the island.

We arrived at the hotel around 9 pm after our long flight from the east coast. The hotel is a bit hard to find as the entrance is on the side street. I knew it was near the McDonalds. Once we arrived we were greeted by the super friendly staff. We had a one bedroom (2103 if I remember correctly). The room was in great shape except for the air conditioner (more on that in a bit). The layout is very nice and the furniture was in great shape, The balcony was a great size and the furniture was very comfortable. I did not realize though till the next morning that the ice maker had to be turned on so we didn't have ice till that night. The room comes with coffee which was nice. I didn't realize and had brought our own. The hotel is up past the major craziness of Waikiki which was nice and beach was a short walk across the street and we walked to the Outrigger Waikiki in less than 10 minutes. The valet was quick and gave us a map which we kept for our entire trip to help us get to the H1 and told us to visit the Pali lookout when we ventured to the North Shore the day after we arrived. I am so glad they told us. The view was tremendous. After returning we explored and found the pool. It looked great but we choose to go into the ocean instead. If we had more time than we would have used the pool. The only issue we had was the air conditioner in the room. The first night it did not shut off. I got up during the night and found a long sleeve shirt and put it on. We told the front desk on our way out. We returned that evening and found that the heat was on and the room was up near 90. We told them and then went out. We came back quite a while later and they were still working on the unit. We were told that they didn't have the part to fix it that night but they could rig it to run all night again. We had them rig it. We could deal with the cold better than the heat. I put pillows from the couch and chairs on top of the tv cabinet in the bedroom to keep it from blowing directly on us. It worked. We addressed this issue the next morning when we checked out and the lady at the front desk told me that she would address it with her manager when he returned about issuing a credit. Well the credit card bill came and no credit. I called the hotel and was credited one night of our stay for our inconvenience. I ordinarily don't do things like that but the problem was not fixed the first time and we were kept out of our room for nearly three hours while it was being fixed at night. It was almost 11 when we got back into our room and our bodies thought it was 4 am. We had to get up early to go to Pearl Harbor the next morning so we could not sleep in. Would we stay here again.

After spent a week here, I found that the Aston has almost nothing comparable, not even close. If Aston is a 4-star hotel/condo, the Maui one would be a 7-star (and it was cheaper than Aston)!This is basically an apartment building - there is a tiny tiny lobby, bedroom-size reception, no bar, no restaurant, a 500 sqft swimming pool that nobody uses, a pool table covered by dust. The room was good, kitchen was well equipped (but again, not comparable with the Maui one). The view would be great if you live above 17 floor (that passes the Aston circle in front of it) and your view isn't partially blocked by your neighbour. The location is the only thing I feel good about it - it is a street away from waikiki beach (which is always super crowded).

Hotel location is perfect with amazing views of Diamond Head, Waikiki Beach and Honolulu city. All staff were friendly and helpful and the porters amazing (mahalo again guys for helping with all shopping).We were kindly upgraded to the penthouse on the 37th floor (mahalo again!) which was fantastic and the additional space certainly helped with unpacking and sorting our shopping. Once again the views are amazing. My only concern was I'm not sure where the photo that Aston Waikiki Beach Tower uses for promotional matieral is because it wasn't the penthouse we were staying in so I'm sure it wouldn't have been the 2 bedroom apartment we originally booked. WIFI was included though the signal was not always strong; having 2 bathrooms was excellent as was having a kitchen, in room laundry, multiple airconditioning systems with separate controls, valet parking and watching the Friday night fireworks from the balcony.There are plenty of affordable restaurants and takeaway places nearby, Waikiki beach directly opposite and a short walk into the bustling part of Honolulu. I would stay here again and have already recommended it to friends travelling to Hawaii.","Perth, Australia","Jacqstar_11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",160,4.0

Paul met us at the Condo and was very helpful with tips on things to do and places to eat. We did have a small issue with the washing machine and Paul came straight over within an hour of ringing him and had it repaired. The last night we were there was the night there was a Tsunami warning in Waikiki and Paul even called us to see if we were alright and to reassure us everything would be fine.

Part way through our stay we were upgraded to a Penthouse, which was essentially the same as the room we had, but on a slightly higher floor.The location of this property is fantastic. We were right across the road from the beach - took us about 3 minutes from our apartment to the sand. Friends were staying at the very luxurious (and pricey) Sheraton up the road. The Sheraton is actually on the beach but because that property is so enormous it took them considerably longer to make it from their room to the sand (proving that more expensive is not necessarily better at least as far as location is concerned!) The Beach Tower is also well situated as far as shopping and restaurants go. Everything you need is right outside your door.The first room we had was lovely - very spacious and clean, the beds were comfy and it had everything we needed. the furniture wasn't exactly modern, but it was all in good repair and comfortable so this was no problem. The view was absolutely spectacular.The service was excellent. Housekeeping staff were friendly and efficient and even came in the evening to offer turndown if desired. My husband hired a couple of surfboards for the week, which staff happily stored for him. Each morning the porters/valets would retrieve his board so all he had to do was carry it across the road and he was set for the day.There was one slight hiccup during our stay but we were very happy with the way the hotel handled this situation. The apartment above ours was being renovated during our stay. One morning we were woken by loud banging noises. My husband complained to management and the problem as swiftly taken care of. Workers were told to stop (as it was 8-30 in the morning and they were not supposed to make noise until after 10) and then we were offered an upgrade to a different room. We ended up in one of the Penthouse suites, which was essentially the same as the room we had been in but on a higher floor and with ""nicer"" furnishings.We were very happy with this solution. The staff moved all our belongings for us and were very apologetic about the inconvenience (which, I have to say, was minimal!)We were very happy with our stay at Aston Waikiki Beach tower and would definitely stay there again.","Melbourne, Australia","Lisa66</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",16,5.0

We are sleeping very comfortably and using the other bathroom that is just outside our bedroom door.The room has a great kitchen with granite counters and nice appliances. There is a pass-through window between the kitchen and the lanai for convenient dining outside.On the ninth floor, we have a great view straight out at the ocean and beach. Being lower, we also have the round tower to our right, but it's not too bad. For more money you can be on a higher floor and look over the round tower. It just wasn't a big deal to us.Service has been prompt and very courteous. Towel requests, paper products, IT support, and other items have been delivered very quickly. Turn-down service each evening includes a chocolate treat. Complimentary valet parking is helpful if you have a car, which we do.

Another great aspect is you walk out of complex and straight across the road is the beach. Great location for shops, ABC stores for general merchandise are everywhere. Cheesecake Factory excellent for meals but queues are huge-go about 5.30pm put your name down and table takes 1.5hrs usually so ready for dinner around 7 pm .you get a buzzer and if you go across the road and sit upstairs at bar the buzzer can be detected fom there so no need to sit and wait outside the restaurant for that length of time. Surfing lessons and outrigger all reasonably priced for beach family activities. Fireworks on Fri night at Dukes beach at 19.45 kids will love them. Only snag we hit was we had early flight so out by 5.30 am and front desk hadn't passed on to bell desk to collect our luggage and order taxis so just double check with guys at front of house that this has been organised.

Waikiki Beach is one of the most expensive and most touristy spots in all of Hawaii, but if even just for visiting Pearl Harbor and spending the day on the beach, it's worth it. The housekeeping was fantastic and very accommodating. The front desk staff and valets would go out of their way with any requests. I'd forgotten the mouse for my laptop and they lent me one. My daughters ""camera"" ran out of AA batteries and they brought one right up. Extra pillows, more coffee, sugars, silverware..... no problem.

I'm not sure if all hotels in Waikiki are not modern, but you should not arrive here expecting the Four Seasons. It's along the same line as a mid-level Hilton. I'd say 3-3.5 stars, certainly not any less than that. The Wi-Fi, although it gave consistent signal, was spotty at times. Nothing concerning though as you shouldn't be sitting around in Hawaii on your computer or phone :) The HVAC system was incredibly loud until we called the front desk and, as always, they arrived promptly and sorted out the problem (a blocked pipe or something) and it quieted down. Even so, the forced air coming out of the vents at times vibrated enough to make the doors vibrate in their frames. The tiling in the bathroom has discoloration in some spots. The appliances and fixtures, including the toilet and the vanities are dated. Not pastel-colors dated, but more like 1980's or early 90's. To make this hotel more ""modern"" would take a massive overhauling which would be both expensive and time consuming - which would make the hotel unavailable for months on end AND make room rates higher, both of which are unacceptable for a location and price like this. So, the only thing you can do is check in with the expectation that there may be some hiccups along the way but absolutely nothing that the amazing staff won't handle promptly and courteously.

Now, 2 years later, our visit was even better than the first.Even though the suites are huge and very nice, and the location is next to perfect, I think that the staff is probably our favorite part of staying at this location. Starting from the check-in, everyone we dealt with was top-notch and seemed to really enjoy their jobs. After check-in we received a follow-up call from Mary at the front desk to ensure everything was OK with our room. In addition, we received a call from Mike, the GM, to again make sure our room met our expectations. The follow-ups didn't disturb us at all and show excellent customer service. If you notice the previous reviews for this hotel, you'll see that Mike does comment on many of them. Obviously, he cares about this hotel and his customers.In addition to the GM and front desk staff, we also had good interaction with the housekeeping staff. They have twice daily cleaning, (evenings are more of a turn down/touchup) and they timed the cleaning with our schedule. I ran into a housekeeper in the entry way and she asked what time would be convenient to do the cleaning. Again, great customer service. In addition, my previous review praised the valet staff, and they were just as good this time. They are there to get the car, but also provide beach mats, towels, and will offer an opinion when asked about an activity. Great group of guys and the 3 we dealt with most, Ed, Eddy, and Russ were all there 2 years ago if I remember correctly. They even offered to park the car ""close"" to save us time if we would be leaving again soon. Of course, you will want to tip the valet staff, but the valet parking is included in the price of the room.The location is fabulous, right across the street from Waikiki Beach. The area directly in front of the hotel has a rock wall that makes the water gentle, but to each side of the wall there are the expected waves for surfing, bodyboarding or playing in the water. This gives you the option of gentler water (great for younger kids), or full waves that our older children enjoy. There is also a small stage area on the beach in front of the hotel where we've seen Hawaiian music played and dancers some afternoon/evenings. Overall, I can't picture a better location on the beach.For our family of older teenagers, the additional space in the suites works well for us. We had the master suite with it's own bathroom, and the kids shared the other bedroom, again with another bathroom. There's a full living room/seating area, a full kitchen with dining area, and a huge lanai. We were on a higher floor and from the front of the unit we could see all the way from Diamond Head to I believe Barber's Point the other direction. From the back of the unit we had a great view of the mountains. Note that each floor only has four units and they go from the front to the back of the building. This means that you will not only have an ocean view, but in many of the suites (on higher floors) also a mountain view over the top of the other hotels, all from the same unit. Since our last visit they have also installed wireless internet in the rooms in addition to the wired.As Eddy loaded the car for us to return to the airport, he stated ""see you again next year"". We talked a little further and realized based on the conversation that he remembered us from our stay 2 years ago. Based on the hundreds of families that stay there every year, this amazed us. I don't know what our travel plans are for next year, but if they include Oahu, you can count on it that you'll ""be seeing us again"".","Prior Lake, MN","dtauer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Prior Lake, MN</strong>",20,5.0

They really know how to show the ""aloha spirit"" to their hotel guests.Unfortunately, the time flew by so fast that before we knew it, it was time to check out and head back home. If your'e looking for a great place to stay on your next trip to Hawaii, I strongly recommend the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower. It has everything you need. They wont nickel and dime you by charging you an additional $10 hotel daily fees for ameneties and another $11 a day for parking, etc. You just pay the price that's listed on your invoice when you check in and plan to have a great time at the famous Waikiki beach which is just steps away from your room.

We are Expedia Elite Plus members and were supposed to receive a room upgrade but were informed that we had already booked the Premium room and would not be upgraded. No big deal. We were initially taken to room 3501 where the view of the ocean was not so panoramic so we requested a different room which we were immediately given. Room 3502 was AMAZING! Everything we wanted and more! The panoramic ocean view from the living area and master bedroom and the size were spot on. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. We were told that you cannot see the Hilton fireworks from the lanai but up that high you definitely can and I would suggest checking it out on Friday nights at dark. The Aston is not what I consider a 5 star but more like a home away from home. Washer and dryer came in handy. Was very nice not have to do dishes also. The only downside was the bed in master was quite hard and uncomfortable and the wireless internet gave us several problems throughout our stay.

The service was impressive. We orignally booked a partial ocean view room but then upgraded to the deluxe oceanfront room upon arrival. We were shown both the penthouse and the deluxe oceanfront rooms (the premium oceanfront rooms were completely booked so we didn't get to see any of them). The penthouse and deluxe OF rooms were exactly the same. However, the penthouse had totally unobstructive views and was high up. You could see the Hilton Hawaiian Village Friday night fireworks from the balcony. The penthouse rooms also comes with slippers and bathrobes for your use (the deluxe oceanfront did not). In the deluxe oceanfront rooms, you can see some of the other surrounding hotels on the sides. The premium oceanfront rooms are higher up and above the the surrounding hotels which is probably the best option if you want beachfront, unobstructed views without having to pay penthouse prices. The TVs were old (non-flatscreen) but had a ton of channels and the rooms could definitely use some spucing up with new coats of paint (there were a lot of visible scuff marks which made the room seem more outdated). However, the tile floors in the bathroom and kitchen were clean (I know because we had to wipe up the wet floor with a towel in these areas and the towel came up clean) and the service impressive. Every time we needed to use our car, the valets were quick. We never waited more than 5 minutes. The valets were friendly and greeted us by name. The in-room washer and dryer was convenient. They provided laundry detergent too. The location was perfect! Just a walk through a beautiful archway of flowers, and the beach was right across the street. The location, amenities, service, & cleanliness definitely outweighed the cosmetic imperfections of the room. We would definitely stay there again. With minor updating and refreshing, I would rate the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower a 5.","Tucson, Arizona","EMT1311</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",41,4.0

We were a little surprised, based on the level of service we'd seen in the past, that they didn't offer to put us in another room as it wasn't a matter of not liking the set up of the room, it actually smelled. I know the hotel was pretty full but we still found it odd. We were planning on upgrading when we could, so we moved rooms anyway. We also received two bottles of champagne during our stay free of charge. The room we upgraded to was on the 30th floors and had spectacular views. We stay there for the space, views, proximity to everything and, above else, the people who work there. The valets are personable, prompt, helpful and very nice. If you're there long enough, they get to know your habits (i.e. if you leave early in the morning) and will park your car accordingly. As we were often driving to other parts of the island, they usually had our car close. The parking is free which is another reason we stay here and they also provide you with towels and chairs free.

If you are considering a stay at one of the other large resort hotels on Waikiki you should check out the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower first. This is a condo-style hotel with 2 BR/2 BA units, full kitchen and in-room laundry. It is a perfect location only a few steps from the beach. One of the great advantages of the Aston is that it does not have a huge lobby with restaurants and bars so you don't get the swarms of people around the hotel as you would at other locations. The comments in other reviews regarding the friendly hotel staff are absolutely true. Everyone we encountered during our stay was so nice it was incredible. The rooms at the hotel are all privately owned units that are managed by the hotel. There is a variation in the decor and remodel dates of the rooms based on when the owner did the upgrades. You can ask the staff at the registration desk when the room was last remodeled and request a more recently updated room if it is available. The rooms a very spacious and it was nice to have a separate bedroom and bathroom for our daughter. There are lots restaurant and bar choices close by and you will really appreciate that they are outside the hotel when you see how busy Waikiki can be. Coming back to a nice quiet hotel was always a pleasure. It really felt like coming home at the end of the day.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment on the 30th floor (room 3003) and we're very happy with all aspects of our stay. The location is brilliant with only a 50m walk across the road to the beach and close to all the action in Waikiki. The view was simply amazing and was worth every cent we paid for a premium room. Make sure when you book you request a room in the centre of the building as the 2 end rooms only have 90 degree views of the ocean from your front balcony. Rooms ending with 02 or 03 have a full 180 degree view of the ocean that you will never get sick of looking at. As a bonus our room was serviced daily and every afternoon we received treats (chocolates, biscuits etc) from the hotel staff. All staff were friendly and went out of their way to attend all of our needs. The 2 Eddys that worked as concierges (bell boys) really stood out and were always happy for a chat or to point us in the right direction.If you are eating out The Cheesecake Factory and Dukes are good value for money if you are just after some casual dining. If you are looking for some takeaway you can't go past Me BBQ which a Korean joint 1 block away. If you have an apartment like we did and want to cook a couple of meals yourself make sure you fork out the $12 for a Cab to the local Safeway. They are open 24 hours and have all your grocery needs as well as alcohol and prescription drugs. Make sure you get a Safeway card. They are a free loyalty card that saved us $40 on our $280 purchase. Make sure you also buy your alcohol from here as it is very expensive from you local Waikiki ABC store. For example a carton of Corona 24pk is $28.99 with your Safeway card.The only fault we could mention about our stay was that there was no range hood in our kitchen. This made cooking a little difficult as smoke would fill the room quiet quickly. A few other people on this site have also mentioned about the rooms being a little out dated. Whilst I will agree they are not 5 star in terms of furnishings etc they are very clean and well maintained. Hey but if you are going to Waikiki for a holiday to sit in your room all day you may as well just stay at home.

We were trying to go to hawaii as economically as possibe. Most hotels on the beach were pretty expensive, but through Travel Hawaii we were able to book the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower, 2 BR Oceanview for about 400 per night. I thought that was incredible compared to other pricing for high end places (most about 600-800 whenright on the beach) Plus this place had modern looking furniture, tvs in every room, a modern kitchen/dining room to eat in to save money.......It was wonderful. We opened the sliding glass doors of the living room and dining room and just walked in and out all day to sit on the balcony or whatever. Also great was the fact that every day the staff would slip a note under our door with an idea of an activity we might want to do on the island that day. The Aston is right across the street from Waikiki Beach, there are lots of places to shop and eat all up and down the street, there is public transportation easily accessible, and if you have a car...free valet. The staff always welcomes you ""home"" each time you arrive. They have free towels, matts, etc for the beach....I could go on and on.

Before booking I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor I must say that I was a bit disappointed. Although we booked a 1 bedroom Ocean View Room we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom Ocean View Room on the 30th Floor. This sounded really great and it was up until they started jack hammering next door as they were renovating the condo next to us. This was only for a day but they should have told us prior and unfortunately this happened the day after our wedding day!!!The building itself was fine but is in need of some updating and for the price I would have expected more. The other thing that was annoying although out of the hotels control was the renovation of the beach which meant that there were trucks and heavy machinery up and down the beach from 7am until lunch time. The hotel didn't discount their prices at all and in fact didn't acknowledge that the beach renovation was happening!!!!On the positive side you couldn't help but get blown away by the views, soooo beautiful and on the 30th floor it was breathtaking!!!! If this building were to be renovated to a higher standard they would be in 5 star class. The position of this condo it great, in the middle of town and the free parking and internet are a big plus. The size of the condo was also a big plus as there is plenty of room to spread out.The service we received was on the whole was pretty good but there were a couple of instances with staff which were unnecessary and uncalled for but most of the people there were great.

It really was a great experience overall. I wanted to share some more details about this property. Hopefully this is helpful.What it definitely is:Great for families to stay together in an apartment like settingStayed at 2 BR/2BA place and it was great for everyone to have their own spaceKitchen is excellently stocked. Had everything we neededView was awesome! Balcony facing Waikiki beach directly. Really gorgeous to wake up to this.Balcony facing beach was spaciousProperty was very cleanHaving laundry on hand was really helpful to wash sandy beachwearLocation is truly fantastic - grocery stores and restaurants are literally within minutesPeople at the front desk, valet and staff were genuinely friendly - Shout out to Tomo! He was awesomeFree valet parking (I think the only place with free valet) in downtown Honululu - awesomeService was top notch - anytime we needed anything someone was upstairs in a jiffy to helpLike I said, it was a great place for the entire family to hang and be with each other - building great memories!For the price, for the amenities, for the location, for the number of people it accomdates, this property is really great!What is it not:Not a high end property - more middle of the roadIf you are looking for a resort feel or high end hotel feel, you will be disappointedSomehow after reading other reviews (which is why I booked this), I was expecting a 4 or 5 star type of property. Did not feel that way thoughFelt a little bit dingy with frayed carpets and old furnitureThe entrance and lobby really left a lot to be desired. They really looked quite ordinary. Not anything like what you would expect to see in a vacation hotel.We stayed on Maui at the Four Seasons Resort at Wailea for a few days in the middle of our trip and contrast was very sharp. Super high end and quite middle of the road. But, for the reasons we chose it (cooking, family time etc), it worked out great for us.

We were upgraded to a full oceanview two bedroom/bathroom apartment which was certainly big enough for a family of four. The decor and furniture were slightly outdated but I understand many of the apartments have been renovated so if that is a concern for you maybe ask for a renovated apartment at the time of your booking. The kitchen was well equipped and the beds comfortable, the location was fantastic, close to beach shops etc; and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The pool area wasn't very inviting and lacked atmosphere but overall we had a great time.Highlights:For mum & dad - sitting on the balcony every night watching the most amazing sunsets with a glass of wine.

We're always greeted by the staff when we left and returned. No restaurant on site but lots of good restaurants within walking distance. It's right across the road from Kuhio beach. If you have young kids or inexperience swimmers Kuhio beach is great because there are breakers which encloses the area so it's look a protected beach.The hotel also had a outdoor pool on 5? floor, so it can get windy. The only complaint that I had was for 2 of the 3 stays our room was ready on arrive day. But they did compensate when we raise our concerns. The first time we got an upgrade to a room with full-view. And the secodn time, they offer us a complimentary bottle of wine.Love the place.

It is very well positioned across the road from Kuhio beach, next to Waikiki. You dont have to lug all the beach gear blocks to the beach , & blocks back. If you have your own or rent a surf board they have storage for those as well. Trolley stop across the road, to all the place you need to go: Ala Moana shopping Mall/Ward Centre/Hilo HatiesOne block back is Kuhio Ave, which is where the main bus lines run . There is a stop at the back end of the hotel which leaves you a 2 min walk home.Our Apartment looked straight out over the palm trees to a beautiful view of the ocean.We found the 2 bedroom/2 bathroom apartments to be fantastic for our family of 5. Much better than having to have 2 hotel rooms. The fully equipped kitchen is great for preparing a few meals to keep your food costs down. There are a few supermarkets within minutes walk to buy your ingredients. There is an ABC shop right outside the front entrance, which is enough get some of the basics with. Our kitchen was very modern with 2 door fridge with water dispenser/ice maker built in, Electric oven & glass cook top. The TVs were all new flat screens, 1 in each bedroom plus a huge on in the lounge room, (Sony Bravias) Not that we watched them a lot but are handy at night & if the weather stops you from getting outside. As mentioned by other reviewers The furniture/decor is a quite dated, but, as a place for a holiday for a week its fine. If you were buying the apartment you would definitely be dong a maker on it, thats for sure. The hotels photos were clearly taken a few years ago, but then they al do the same thing.The front desk & concierges were all extremely friendly & were easy & pleasant to deal with.Based on my experience I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to any one looking for a apartment style hotel close to everything.","Green Point, Australia","PJay2412</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Green Point, Australia</strong>",198,5.0

The hotel/condominium is well located, with ocean across the street. The staff is great, free valet parking and wireless (very fast) internet. Rooms are very spacious. The view from the higher floors is marvelous.However, there are several problems with this hotel. It is completely outdated. It looks like lots of years old. The price is more or less the same price for other hotels (if you don’t mind to be in a hotel instead of a condominium) right on the beach not across the street, like this one.I love high-rise buildings and the views from it. We stayed at a 30's floor. But I can't imagine staying in this hotel with small children playing around. I will definitely need a special door lock for the terrace and then you will probably lose the best of the rooms, the terrace with the doors wide opened.Finally, the photos that you will see of this hotel/condominium in several web sites aren't close to the reality. This place looks old. The photo of the room that you can see everywhere with a hall and some kind of dining room or lanai, well, that wasn't mine. It's offered as the ""2 Bedroom Oceanfront Suite"", I paid more for a ""2 Bedroom Premium Oceanfront Suite"", which was supposed to be the same room but at an upper level, and it was far a way of looking like that.",Mexico City,"kartikmexico</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mexico City</strong>",163,3.0

Pros – Central Location, close to everything and directly across the road from the Waikiki enclosed beach area. Spacious rooms, kept very clean by housekeeping. Beds are very comfortable with cable TV in every room. Outstanding service from all Aston staff members – professional, courteous and helpful. Great views from Ocean View apartments. Fast internet access from all areas.Cons – Rooms are very clean but extremely dated think 1980’s with 1990’s mod cons. Swimming pool is small and also dated. We didn’t go in the pool during our entire stay despite my children’s love of resort style swimming pools. If anything the top level apartments are too high with constant wind noise coming from Diamond Head and whistling through the windows even when they were closed. I’m not scared of heights but from the 33rd floor the view was incredible but a little uncomfortable. It’s a long way down. In summary the service from the staff and cleanliness of the rooms made up for the outdated premises. We don’t regret staying there but there are better places right on the beach if you can live with a hotel room set up rather than the apartment/condominium style.","Sydney, Australia","galaga88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",53,4.0

Great 2 bedroom suite on the 8th floor and aside from the round building in front of us, it was a great view and balcony. The service from everyone was very good. The car was brought to us so fast every time we needed it, was nice not to have to find parking. The cord was broken in the room for the internet and within 5 minutes we had a service tech there fixing it. I had 4 little complaints. The toilets are strange. Everytime you sit, water starts pouring into the bowl and scared my kids haha! There is an option to wash and dry. When you select the dry option, it smells like cow manure seriously! For my Mom who was on the couch in the living room, the hall light was on all the time which I understand. The issue was that there are glass sides to the door which allowed the light to shine in which bothered her and would bother me as well. At most hotels, there are boogie boards, snorkel gear etc. to borrow for the day. There was none of that so we had to purchase 4 boogie boards to use for the 3 days that we had there which was very expensive. We left them to a family we met at the pool so they wouldn't have to spend the money(they had 2 kids the same as us and were very grateful). The 3rd thing that I was dissapointed about was how cold the pool was. It is shaded the entire day so it doesn't warm up from the sun for sure. It was deserted most of the time. There is a great hot tub by the pool but when you pay for a pool in the price, you hope that it isn't freezing, this one was. We stayed at the Aston in Maui and the landscaping was beautiful, great pool and hot tub. Other than these small things, we had a great stay, can't say enough about the service and the room. Go to Duke's for supper, fun and great salad bar. Great shopping, never seen so many stores in my life! If I were to come back, I would stay here again, great beach as well.

Whether or not this hotel is for you really depends on what you want. The best part of this hotel is its location - right opposite Waikiki Beach. Also the fact it is self-contained is a huge plus: having your own kitchen and laundry is a real bonus. Beware though, that the oceanfront apartments look directly into the back of the neighbouring property if you are on a level lower than level 12. You will see right into your neighbours apartment, and they will see into yours. We still had great views of the beach from our balcony, but the next door hotel was a little distracting. The hotel itself is looking a little tired and drab in places, we found the furniture somewhat shabby and the bed uncomfortable. Noisy small wall-mounted airconditioner made for restless sleeping. If you wander through some of the larger well known hotels/resorts, then this one is certainly in need of some upgrades by comparison. However, if looks dont bother you, then this hotel will be great. The valets and concierge staff were very friendly and helpful, however there was only one person in the front office who bothered to make any effort and provide anything remotely resembling service. Note here: i have already taken this up with management, who have responded to my experiences and are looking into the matters we brought up.

This was our second time staying at the tower. On our first visit, we got an upgrade to a presidential suite at no extra cost. The view from the top floors are astounding, so we were disappointed with the view from our 12th floor balcony this time. For those wanting a good view, I would suggest asking for a room above the 15th floor (about the top of the Circle Hotel, which is in front of the Beach Tower). As others have said, the service is outstanding. The valet was very speedy, and they always remembered where we had gone for the day and asked how our trip was. Also, the room service was always very fast in bringing whatever we requested, from laundry soap to a new iron.I wouldn't say that the suite was in the best shape; it could use a good paint to clean up the scuff marks and dings in the walls, and a good spring clean for items that wouldn't normally get cleaned every day (like the cupboards or water sprinkler heads). The beds were very comfy, but for the first few nights we slept on the hide-a-bed. Hide-a-beds are rarely as nice as real beds, and this was no exception.We enjoyed our stay at the Beach Tower. This is a nice place to stay if you have a large family and are looking to make your meals at the condo rather than eating out.","Saskatoon, Canada","Rajahaj</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saskatoon, Canada</strong>",1,3.0

Being just across from the beach it was so easy to come and go as we pleased, our teens could head up to the room while we stayed on the beach with the younger ones, and you could even watch your older kids surfing from our balcony!On our first stay our apartment was very well equipped (our second stay not as good, less kitchen equipment, pans not big enough for a large family etc) but on both occasions the beds were very comfortable, the apartments were quiet and we were exceptionally happy with our stay.A suggested improvement - There is a large frosted glass partition next to the front door of every apartment - overnight it lets a LOT of light in from the outside hall lights which made sleeping for those on the sofa-bed difficult - resulting in us having to stack a tower 7 foot high of sofa cushions next to the glass to block the light out!)But next trip to Oahu, we already know where we will be staying :-)","Robina, Australia","lisa31jane</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Robina, Australia</strong>",115,4.0

There were lots of others doing the same. The beach got crowded during Christmas. This is a great place to stay if you need 2 bedrooms.

We realised the short way but had spent the whole day touring and were extremely tired.

We have never stayed at an Aston property before; nor had we ever rented a condo. We were there for 11 nights and we would agree with most of what others have written. To elaborate somewhat on our experience ... Location: For us, the location was fantastic - right across from Kuhio Beach, in a somewhat quieter section of Waikiki than, for example, the Royal Hawaiian, but not as quiet as the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Ilikai area (where we also stayed on our return from Maui). We bought groceries at the Food Pantry, a nice, short walk (about 5 minutes) and, of course, there were about 4 ABC stores within 1 minute walk. To see Oahu (and snorkel at Hanauma Bay) we rented a car for part of the stay - the Hertz agency was in the Hyatt which is right next door.Condo: The condo was spacious and very quiet. There are 2 units per section, with 2 sections per floor separated by a breezeway. Elevators arrived within a minute or 2. We were greateful for the washer and dryer and the fully equipped kitchen. Sitting on the lanai having coffee, eating breakfast, and watching the surfers was such a pleasant way to start each day. The lanai was large and comfortable and we watched the most beautiful sunrises and sunsets, and on one side had a view of Diamond Head. Staff: As has been said by many, the staff are friendly and helpful, especially the valet. By the same token, we experienced the ""aloha spirit"" from virtually everyone we met in the service industry (e.g., gas station attendants, the clerks at the Food Pantry and ABC stores, restaurant staff), on the beach, at Hanauma Bay, etc. The one area that was inconsistent for us was the cleanliness of the condo. We noticed that on at least one occasion the toilet was not cleaned; on another, the floor was not vacuumed; and, as far as we could tell, the tub was not cleaned at all while we were there. On the other hand, the kitchen was always cleaned and supplies refilled. Nor did we say anything at the time, which we probably should have.Having said that, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend the Waikiki Beach Tower.

Our reason for choosing this particular resort was the great reviews found on here, so we thought we should share our experience on here as well.Staff: The front desk staff and valet were all very courteous and helpful. They helped us with dining reservations, directions for getting around town and finding the best deal on surf lessons for our kids. The housekeeping staff kept our apartment clean and tidy everyday along with little bedtime snacks for the kids. They were very kind and accommodating with our comings and goings.Hotel: I can’t emphasize enough how great this location is. It is exactly 74 steps from the lobby to putting your toes in the sand at the beach. We loved the view and found there to be no noise from the air conditioners nearby, however we were on the 36th floor which may have helped with that. The balcony is enormous! We sat out there every morning and had our coffee, then every evening having our wine. Very calm, hardly a hint of a breeze. There are many places to dine, fancy or fast food nearby and of course an ABC store at almost every corner. Transportation: Take an ABC Limo (Melvin) to and from the airport. It’s not a whole lot more than a taxi and it’s a nice way to start the holiday. We even requested a bottle of chilled champagne which was very welcome after a 5 hour delay in travel, which to our great pleasure the ABC crew was aware of and were still there to greet us 5 hours after we were scheduled to arrive. The lei’s were lovely and fragrant as well. Our only glitch was on our return trip to the airport – Melvin forgot about us, but with one quick phone call from us – and he was there to pick us up within 5 minutes and refused to take payment for the return trip.

The hotel is nice, clean, obviously well kept, but not a luxury place. The staff was very helpful, everyone we met. For a family trip where having a home-like room is valuable I would recommend highly.

As you can imagine, our hotel choice was a pretty big decision for us to make. As it turned out we decided to stay at the Aston Beach Tower based on a recommendation made by our travel agent. Let me just say up front that I’m so glad that we did, as every aspect of the hotel is amazing.For starters, the staff was truly amazing and really went out of their way to make sure we enjoyed every aspect of our visit. I do want to take a moment to mention some of these people, as they were truly instrumental to our experience. When we initially booked our stay, Regan, the hotel manager, gladly handled our call and notated every request that we made. In addition, my wife called several times after the initial booking to either change or add additional requests, and Regan not only handled those, but remembered all of our previous requests and ensured that they had been taken care of (which they had).Regan knew the significance of our trip, and my wife and I truly appreciated all of his efforts to make our trip absolutely amazing. If we had it to do all over again, we would not have changed a thing.In addition to Regan, there were several other staff members that I feel a need to mention. I will honestly say that some of the best people we met on our entire trip were the members of the valet team at our hotel, specifically Eddie, Greg and Ed. In addition to retrieving and parking our car quickly, they also went out of their way to make sure we knew our surrounding area and the best possible routes to take for each venue that we wanted to visit. Eddie provided us with great info on local restaurants to visit which we would not have known about without him… And they were great by the way. I also feel the need to mention Russ who is another member of the parking crew. Although he was polite and professional, it seemed like Russ looked for ways to tell me why he could not help me as opposed to just doing what I asked. Obviously, I’m not very well versed in the standard operating procedures of valet parking, but I thought his reasoning for not complying was a little excessive and unnecessary. None of the other gentlemen listed earlier had any problems with my requests and handled them without any hesitation. I would say that he was the only downside of our stay at the Aston Tower. As for the hotel itself, the rooms are very spacious and provide a great atmosphere for your vacation. The view is truly magnificent no matter where you stay in the hotel, and all of the rooms have dual access to the balcony which is a really nice feature. Each room is fully equipped with a kitchen (with cookware) and a washer/dryer set, and all of the necessities are provided free of charge. The hotel also has some great addition amenities which include its own beach access, complimentary beach towels and shower areas to wash off at after you return from the beach. As you can probably tell, everything you need is taken care of for you, so you’re only job while at the Aston is to relax and enjoy your trip.All in all, I would recommend anyone and everyone to stay at the Aston Beach Tower on their trip to Waikiki. It’s absolutely amazing in every aspect and I promise that you will not be disappointed… The decision is truly a no-brainer!","Richmond, Virginia","Mike M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",36,5.0

The rooms were spacious with nice furniture and the kitchen was so well equiped it made it very easy to cater for ourselves if we wanted to. We could not fault the staff who were very helpful and friendly. Our only criticisms were that we thought the complex was right on the beach but there was a road between the building and the beach which during the day had a lot of traffic on it so sitting on the balcony was noisy. We unfortunately also picked a week when they were replacing the footpath which added to the noise. The main reason the noise was so loud was we were on the 7th floor which led to another problem. If you look at the picture on their webpage you will see a very strategically placed sailboard that strangely enough blocks out the hotel off to the right of the building. If you are below about the 14th floor and on the right hand side of the building you are about only 80 feet away from other apartments who can look into you and you into them which kind of destroyed the feeling of privacy and also blocked all the view that way. Be aware also that they take an additional imprint of $100 on checking in for incidental expenses. Unfortunately for us they did not inform us they were doing this and as we paid on a debit card we lost access to that $100 while we were there and the reversal did not occur until we were back in Australia so were left with $100 of american money we could not use.I would recommend staying at the Beach Towers but only if you have a room above the 14th floor.,"Melbourne, Australia","Judy06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",71,4.0

The noise was really loud from the air handling units on the building across the street and below us. These was a definite turn-off if you paid top dollar for the unit or tried to entertain on the lanai or with the doors open.

We took the two bedroom suite on the 18th floor. We got some savings off the rate by using our Entertainment card.PROS:--This is a CONDO property so some would argue that you can't expect any quality service because you are staying in someone's home. Well, the staff here is 4-5 star! They even called around for dinner reservations after making excellent suggestions. Except for one issue I had (more later), I always got a follow-up call after the quick turnaround of requests I had (the wifi doesn't work, may I have another box of Tide, etc)--Without too much traffic, the ride to Pearl Harbor was about 20 minutes.--The 2 bedroom suite is big and has a nice, diverse view including beach, crater, and city. The bedding configuration was perfect, two twins, a pullout, and a king size.--The washer/dryer was bigger than I'm used to seeing in-room.--The TV was weirdly awesome-- I think it's 3D!--The balcony was nice including one lounge chair you could prop your feet onto.--The valet was prompt; parking free so tip the terrific bell staff nicely!--There is a lot to do/eat/shop within walking distance. At night there is outdoor entertainment not too far away.--As busy as this section of Waikiki is, our suite was pretty quiet.CONS (mostly minor):--I liked the beach-- more sandy, a little more wavy-- in front of the Hyatt better, barely a one block walk from the hotel. This preference was in no way a dealbreaker to cause switching to the Hyatt.--The furnishings in my suite were somewhat drab.--You can't really hear the lap of the surf.--The pool is tiny-- but c'mon, you've got a beach!--Beware the staff's recommendations for a good beach! Three different, good-natured people at different times at the front desk suggested beaches that I researched and read that inexperienced people with kids (namely, us) could be hurt or killed: Sandy (aka BREAK NECK), Makapu'u (deemed for experts only), and Halona (no facilities, guards, and a slippery, sharp, steep, rocky path to climb). The beach in front was nice and so was Kailua, about 30 minutes away.--The one bad spot: The bed in the master bedroom was lumpy and I couldn't get good sleep. I called about it the first day and the staffer said uncharacteristically unkindly that the rooms are privately owned and there was nothing that could be done (no room change was offered.) I suggested a board to slip under the mattress and they quickly arranged that but the bed remained lumpy. The night before we checked out, a kinder staffer said that he had heard complaint of the same by another guest who chose to sleep on the pullout coach. This was not an option for us; my teenager was using that bed. I highly recommend this property assuming you will get a better night's sleep.","Queens, New York","RoadTrip19Mom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queens, New York</strong>",210,4.0

But from the moment we arrived we realised it was all true and more!If you want a serviced suite with every modern convenience this is the pick of the bunch, and we’ve been around. The full kitchen in our two bedroom deluxe apartment included a double-door refrigerator with ice and water dispenser, 1300W microwave oven, conventional oven/ceramic halogen cooktop (download Whirlpool Accubake manual from the Web as the in-room instructions relate to some other appliance!), dishwasher, toaster, coffee maker, and rice cooker. We also enjoyed a DVD player and over 200 channels of cable TV in each bedroom as well as the living room, plus washer/dryer unit, iron and ironing board, clock radio, and in-room safe plus ducted rangehood, Insinkerator, airconditioning in all sleeping and living areas, magnificent view overlooking Waikiki Beach (as well as a great view out the kids’ room, looking up the mountain), free valet parking, free beach towels, free bucket, spade and model boat for the kids, pool and spa, and terrific staff. This is the only place we’d choose when we return to Honolulu!If we had to find anything to be pernickety about (which we don’t, but we know Michael appreciates the feedback) there was only a handful of small things, such as the lateness of the housekeeping (usually between 3 pm and 4 pm), the lack of decent water pressure in the shower, the 512K slightly slow Internet access, and the need to run the dishwasher twice a day due to there being insufficient place settings to accommodate even two meals for a family of four.It’s important to manage people’s expectation levels so we don’t want people to be disappointed, but we can really only find superlatives springing to mind. We have had a fantastic time here for almost a week and felt right at home very quickly. The kids are fussy eaters but with the facilities for self-catering we were fine, with plenty of eat out options when they’d earned a treat. For those with a car, shop at Safeway but make sure you apply for a Safeway Club card (cite the Aston as your address!) as you will save huge $ on your shopping. On our initial grocery shop to stock the pantry we saved over $45 with our club card!For rental cars choose Hertz or Budget as they both have a service desk at the Hyatt Regency which is in the next block. The one way fee of $15 is cheaper than the cab fare if, like us, you’re departing by ship and not by air.In summary, a most enjoyable holiday in a magnificent apartment. We’ll definitely be back!

But overall these things were minor and I would stay in that exact unit in a heartbeat! The housekeeping staff were great (and with two teenagers ...) You just leave the dishes in the sink and they put them in dishwasher when they refreshed the unit. Washer & dryer came in handy. We shopped at a local Safeway so some meals & snacks were available for the kids whenever they wanted.Waikiki is a busy urban area, but we live in the country so it was a delightful change. The best thing was having the beach right there. I loved sitting on the large lanai and watching the ever-present surfers.

We were there for 12 days. It was perfect. I would recommend this place to all ages.We had a two room condo on the 21st floor. Lots of room for us all to spread out and relax. Nice kitchen, dining area, living room, two bathrooms and one bedroom with a king bed and one with two twins. And a ton of storage space. We had all but two breakfast in our condo. (You have to go to Duke's a few times while your there!) We had a full size fridge so we went to Wal-Mart and stocked up. It was great. We stayed at a different place the year before and we found it to be so noisey. We could hear the people next to us all the time. At Aston Waikiki Beach Tower we never heard anybody and we had people next to us. I had great sleeps this time and I was on the pull out couch near the door. Plan on spending alot of time on the balcony to enjoy the view. Balcony is a good size. The four of us sat on it with alot of room to spare.They also have a great Swimming pool area. Nice size pool and a hot tub. Lots of places to grab a lounger and sit in either the sun or shade. Very clean and well kept. They also had a pool table in this area but we did not use it. On the pool level they have change rooms and showers and a sauna.All the staff were freindly and very helpful. The room was clean, you had maid service twice a day but we turned the night time one away alot as we didn't need it. The view was spetacular. We were across the road from Waikiki Beach which was great as we were there for the tsunami so we got to watch everything from our hotel balcony. (The staff was excellent through it..very patient with the worried tourists) The hotel is at the quieter end of the main drag which I preferred. We rented a car for most of our trip. The hotel has valet parking at no charge! Unheard of in any other hotel. We tipped the valet of course but it beats paying $25 each day. They also have a stock of beach items you can borrow. Chairs, small boards, floating rings. Just ask.If I had to dig for something I didn't like I would say the air conditioner had a loud rattle that kept me up a first until I just turned the air off at night. It was still cool in our room in the morning as the bedroom air (they were quiet) was on. Also, when you sit on the balcony you have to listen to the air conditioning running in the hotels around you as you are at their roof level. If that is something that would bother you just move up to a higher floor. But really, they are not bother some. Don't be afraid of the price..we found it was cheaper than the hotel we originally had booked.

We booked a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom condo. Upon arrival, the valet was very friendly. At registration, the receptionist asked if we wanted to upgrade our room. We initially did not agree, but she went and spoke to her manager and he agreed to lower the extra price per day cost. We ended up with a room on the 29th floor. The hallways are VERY quiet as there are 2 towers and only 2 rooms per floor, so you don't have to worry about kids or drunken adults running or talking loud down the hallway late at night. Our room was VERY clean and equipped with everything we needed. The hotel has internet access but not wi-fi the rooms. A secret: the hotel does have a limited number of wi-fi modems available, so ask to see if one is available to be installed in your room. Location wise, the Aston is in a great location. There's a McDonald's right around the corner and is on the main ""strip"" of Waikiki. Great for walking and sightseeing. Note to anyone driving: the auto-accessible entrance to the hotel is on a sidestreet. You will see the sign for Aston on Kalakaua but you have to make a left turn on Liliuokalani Ave. The only gripe I had about the Aston is housekeeping. The first day, when we arrived back to our room around 6pm, no one had been there. Housekeeping quickly brought up a change of towels and removed the trash. Apparently they don't service the rooms until late in afternoon/evening. I asked if they could come earlier next time...and then she showed up at like 9:30 a.m. We asked her to come back around noon, and our room was serviced when we returned later that afternoon.

They were all so nice and genuine and went out of their way to help us. Another great part about our stay was the room (condo). They were huge and had great views, we were on the 16 floor and there was a hotel partly blocking our view, but it didn't matter. The balcony was roomy and perfect for watching the waves and sunsets. There were five people in our party, four adults and a baby. There was so much space for everyone. We even had a little play area for the baby. Often times our parents came to visit, and there was plenty of space to talk and just hang out. Because, our rooms were toward the back of the unit. We could actually talk while the baby slept. The kitchen was also extremely helpful. We could keep the baby and ourselves on a somewhat healthy diet. Plus, we often saved $$ by cooking and eating breakfast in our room.My ideal place (when we can afford it) is a four star resort, so I was a little surprised at how much I loved having this home away from home. I would never stay anywhere else while visiting Waikiki.Also the location was perfect. Walking distance to the zoo and all the Waikiki shopping and restaurants.Just a note for those travelers who need a totally dark room.

Laundry facilities were available right in your room. There were tvs in the living area and the bedroom (if you ever found time to watch them). Towels, soaps, coffee, etc. were amply replenished twice daily. A grocery delivery service was also an option of which we took full advantage.

They were most helpful and courteous. Couldn't ask for better service. My lower rating is only due to the fact that our condo, while spacious and well furnished, was very outdated. The cabinets were warped and the wood was actually flaking off in places. The carpet was old and warn. The appliances were old. It just looked tired and worn. It was also quite dusty and not as clean as I would have expected. This may have been due to the fact that we changed from our original room so they did not have the chance to dust. As each unit is separately owned, it may be that this one unit is the exception, not the rule. However, for the price, I would have expected all units to be newer looking and feeling. Or maybe they could offer a lower price for the outdated units. Too bad, as the service can't be beat, Really. Hats off to them for getting that right.

The big resorts further west on Waikiki all seemed ""self contained,"" and we really liked being in the thick of the town, shopping, restaurants, etc.We were very pleased with our choice of the Waikiki Beach Tower, and really appreciated a few of the things you would not get at a big chain: complimentary valet parking, washer/dryer in the unit, nightly turndown with sweets (especially the chocolate covered macadamia nuts), and full digital cable package.We stayed at another Aston property on Maui (the Mahana) the week after we left Waikiki and thought the service and friendliness at Waikiki Beach Tower were much better. Staff remembered us, asked about our plans so they could park the car in the most efficient spot, and all-in-all seemed happy and eager to be of assistance. Special kudos for Ed the valet and Will and Koga at the front desk – we found the three of them to be especially helpful.Would definitely look to stay here again if we make it back to Waikiki.",Washington DC,"Cr0ssC0untryTraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC</strong>",19,5.0

The concierges and staff are all very helpful and friendly. The drive in entrance to the hotel would be a little tricky to find so if you are driving yourself ask for directions to the driveway. McDonalds is just in front of the hotel and there are several ABC stores within easy walking distance. The best place to catch the Bus is a couple of blocks behind the hotel, ask the concierge. Diamond Head is only open Friday,Saturday and Sunday at the moment so check before you go up there. Tours tend to pick you up at either the Pacific Beach Hotel which is next door (across the road) or on the street behind the hotel, ask for the specific pick up place to wait because we waited just near the entrance to our hotel (on the side road) and the drivers always seemed to be at the Pacific Beach Hotel and we usually had to find the bus and wait for the driver. The restaurants in Waikiki book up really fast my suggestion is to book ahead, so if you arrive in the morning it is worth going for a walk down the main street and booking a restaurant for dinner, we went to about 6 restaurants on our first night in Waikiki before we found one with an available table. We also prebooked for other nights as well. The Concierges are happy to book activities and tours for you as well as Shuttles to take you where you want to go. We caught shuttles to Waikele Outlets, Fleamarkets and Pearl Harbor. If you are using the shuttles try not to change the pick up time as you end up waiting around for them to come from somewhere else as they plan their day on the first time you agreed on.","Canberra, Australia","austrip</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",92,5.0

You opened the door of this spacious apartment and it was just ""wow"". We had a breathtaking view of the ocean and the beach. Both bedrooms were spacious and clean, the kitchen was well-equipped, you could eat outside on the lanai or inside. The aircon worked very well as did all electric and electronic appliances. Wifi was available on the 4th floor recreational area and in the lobby. The bed, btw was very comfortable and we slept very well. The suite was cleaned well by housekeeping who also asked you in the evening if you had any requirements. There is a very large Safeway about 5mins drive away. The beach is just across the road and you can borrow beach towels from the bell desk as you go out. The beach tower is slightly set back from the road so because of the location you could retire to your apartment or you could be ""right in amongst it"". There's plenty to look at in Waikiki during the day and in the evening! The personnel at the bell-desk, the concierge and housekeeping were excellent, Front desk efficient with checking in and out.

It was myself, husband, 2 kids in one room, then my brother, his wife, my mom in another room.We booked through a travel agent, and wanted to get rooms toward the bottom, easier for elevators, etc...We got the 5th floor. From the website it makes it look like this hotel is right smack on the beach....it's not. It is across the street. So the pictures online that show a couple overlooking the water, it is a little deceiving.The room for my brother was much nicer than ours. Theirs looks like the one online, ours was very outdated. However, their room had many things break down on them...locked bedroom door, fridge issue, and the worst was the overflowing of their bathroom sink due to the room (I think above them). But, the hotel was always quick to fix everything and was very nice. We never had any issues with our room. The lanais are HUGE. Great to open the door and have our boys run around outside. They have twice daily maid service which is great. Loved getting chocolate treats each night! We had a full kitchen which was great. We made a trip to the store for breakfast items. But, being a first time visit to Hawaii I wanted to eat out all the time. LOVED everything I ate. There is a coffee shop right across the street which had tasty baked goods.Loved having a laundry facility in our room. Was perfect with small kids!! Our sleeping arrangements were a master bedroom/bath, and twin beds in the other room with a bath right near that. It was kind of loud at night with traffic/tour buses and that started again around 6 am. I almost felt like the windows were open it was so loud. But, I had no trouble sleeping. The beds were very comfortable as well as the linens.The staff was very helpful/friendly. I could never find a good deal on the attractions we wanted to go to from concierge, but that was fine. I also could never find a restaurant to honor the kids eat free with the lanyard, but no big deal either. The kids got a beach bucket/toys upon checkin. The beach is RIGHT across the street. It was great! We could easily walk through the flowered trellis and cross the street to the beach, even for quick dips into the water. My husband took the boys out and saw great fish in the water. There is an ABC store very close by, a few really. Great for little things we needed. For those new to the area, they have cold food, snacks, toiletries, souvenirs, etc....Not a big grocery store, but a large convenience store.Getting our rental car for excursions was very easy, friendly staff.The rate for the room was kind of expensive, but we had such a great time on our vacation. We toured all over Oahu and fell in love with this island!!! The hotel was perfect for us. We kind of felt like it was home for our week we were there.Our hotel was walking distance to the zoo and aquarium which was fun for a few little adventures with the kids. We brought our letterboxing journals and were able to get stamps from a couple places. Fun for the kids!I think I would stay there again, but also interested in maybe another part of the strip, or even another island.

Location was awesome. All we had to do was cross the street at the stoplight and we were on the famous Waikiki Beach. Hotel staff was amazing! From the first day, any questions we had or issues that came up they were more than happy to help us. Only downside that I could think of was that they Did not offer wi-fi in rooms.

We choose this condo for the complimentry valet parking and comfort of home; the three nights stay are for business this time) Upon arrival we were greeted by the valet, and our rental car and luggages were taking of. We knew that we had arrived early and decided to have lunch at a Japanese restaurant down the block. At approximately 2 PM our room was ready and we were assigned to room 2401 on the 24th floor. I was very impressed with the valet and bellhop service; everything was done in an expeditious and profesional manner. Our one bedroom was clean with good view of Waikiki beach; kitchen is nice and fully equiped. However, we never use the kitchen because of our schedule and the fact that we rather dine in the vicinity of Waikiki beach; plenty of restaurant to choose from. The unit has very good sound proof glass door; on the lanai you could hear the constant air duct noise from the hotel on the next block. Perhaps higher floor would not be as bad. We usually leave the condo around 9:00 AM every morning and valet would have our car ready within 2 minutes. When we returned at the condo at 3PM the unit are thoroughly cleaned. Every evening we would have nice dinner in the vicinity and when we returned housekeeping would have completed the turndown service.

The proximity to the beach, the breathtaking view of Diamond Head & Waikiki, the friendly service and spacious rooms are just a few things that draw us back each year. You'd be hard pressed to find any condos/hotels that are this spacious at this price range. And it is located directly across from the beach. So, no driving, no parking hassles to get to a beach. In fact, they keep a storage of boogie boards, mats, and other beach gears that you can borrow during your stay. (Many guests donate their almost new boards when they leave). The staff at Waikiki Beach Tower is always professional and friendly - especially those guys at the bell desk. They embody the spirit of Aloha. One of our favorite things to do in Hawaii is to have breakfast at lanai while enjoying the gorgeous view.

The bathroom fixtures are not exactly what you would find at 5 star hotel, but they are certainly acceptable. Their service and location definitely rank 5 stars. It is also convenient that each unit has its own washer & dryer. On a totally different subject, if you do stay in the Waikiki Beach Tower (or elsewhere in Oahu), do try malasadas from Leonards' Bakery - located within 10 minute drive from the condo. Malasadas are Portugese version of jelly donuts. I'm usually not a fan of donuts, but they were so delicious! There is usually a long line at the store, but it is worth the wait. The view from Waikiki Beach Tower and those malasadas are the two things I miss the most from Oahu. I can't wait until our next trip!",NYC,"Gloria P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",96,5.0
