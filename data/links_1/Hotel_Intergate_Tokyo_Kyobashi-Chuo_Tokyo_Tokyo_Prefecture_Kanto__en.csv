There is a FamilyMart on the ground floor and many eateries nearby at Tokyo Square Garden.

Room is very clean and slightly bigger than other local-chained hotels that I have stayed before. The room has space for a small coffee table and two cushioned stools by the window for me and my partner to sit and enjoy a cup of tea.3. Complimentary (free flow) hot coffee, tea, ice water and juices at the lounge area for in-house guests.4. 24 hour convenience store available right below the hotel. You can enter in and out from within the building without having to get out of the hotel.5. Hotel is located less than 1 min walk to Kyobashi Station Exit 1 (Tokyo Metro Ginza Line) and Takaracho Station Exit A4 (Toei Asakusa Subway Line). 6. Convenient to get to Haneda Airport as the Toei Asakusa Subway Line offers direct train service from Takaracho Station.7.

We came in exhausted after our international flight, so no happy hour, cookies, etc wanted. We needed extra time in the morning, which they smilingly offered at $20, so, no. Their right to charge but very disappointing. The good:Spent the extra for a corner twin and well worth it for the space. Quite a bit of the space is wasted in this room with essentially two entry areas...but room to spread your luggage about. Windows on 2 walls really make it feel open.Lots of outlets at the bed. Super comfy mattress. Larger towels than many hotels in this category. All amenities provided. Very very quiet.Breakfast was a small affair, but plenty of proteins from eggs to little sausages. Coffee was good. Delicious fresh fruit. The best thing about this hotel, which I was unclear on when I booked, is that it is a non-stop train from Haneda Airpot to Takaracho Station on the Keikyu Line. This takes you 20 feet from their entrance. The hotel would do well to make this clear to visitors.

The bathroom is more spacious than a normal Japan bathroom. Is the room small? Sure, but not the smallest we have encountered. We had enough space to lay out our standard luggage. Very high quality room. WiFi was excellent.The hotel goes the extra mile for guests in the common areas. Every day they have available free coffee and tea, a honey buffet (which is 4 types of honey to try with bread) during late afternoon hours, wine and crackers before dinner hours, and late night rice porridge snack for those still hungry. Their reception is very friendly, very attentive.Location is excellent too. It is a 10 minute walk from Tokyo station, only a 15 minute walk to Tsukiji fish market, a short walk to Ginza, and right next to several metro lines. Best of all is that the price won't break the bank. Very affordable for near 5-star quality (in my opinion).Will stay here again in the fuure.","Alexandria, Virginia","Todd_K19</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",41,5.0

The lack of a proper a wardrobe is annoying for me, and the bathroom module is crammed to fit all the necessary parts (toilet, bathtub, sink etc). Intergate is located conveniently close to Tokyo station and is easily accessed by foot from both subway lines. The lobby is on the second floor and shared with the breakfast restaurant. The breakfast is amazing, with a large selection of dishes, both western and eastern style. A special treat is the “free” after work bar that the hotel complimentary keeps open in the afternoons serving wine and other beverages. Kind and helpful staff will be able to help your stay being as comfortable as possible. As always the hotel is spotlessly clean and no disturbing noise disturbs your sleep as the neighbourhood is calm and quiet.

The hotel is extremely new and everything is in excellent condition. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and relaxation/dining area in a stylish Japanese modern design. There is even a selection of books about Japan and Tokyo to browse over a free coffee. Staff are extremely friendly, helpful and attentive. Better service frankly than some European luxury hotels that I've stayed in. The room was very small, as is the reality in Tokyo apart from the top end, but very cleverly designed to be highly comfortable and functional. All kinds of thoughtful conveniences are provided, from charger adaptors to room freshening spray. Wifi quality was excellent. A convenience store is available on the ground floor with pretty much anything you could want in terms of drinks and snacks. Be aware that some rooms face a blank wall, so take care in booking if that is not your preference. Location is on a somewhat quiet business street but there is a Metro stop next door (Asakusa line) and Tokyo station (with its excellent underground shopping mall) and the Imperial Palace district are but a relatively short walk, as is Tsukiji market and central Ginza.I would highly recommend this hotel as a good value for money base to explore Tokyo and I would certainly stay there again in the future.

Not quite in Ginza and not quite in Nihonbashi, but a comfortable walk to both. Subway stop right by the front door, and a convenience store on the ground floor, all made it a great place to stay. Staff was very friendly and hospitable (although they seemed to work longer hours than might be healthy—- the same staff that we saw in the night shift were there to greet us when we came down for breakfast!). Special kudos to Mr. Oota, who was especially gracious and helpful to us. My only complaints: wish the staff could speak better English, wish there were Western channels (like CNN!) on tv, and wish the air conditioning in our room stayed consistently cool (Tokyo was really HOT during the week that I was there).

Problems during check in, hotel staff does not know what to do, rooms are tiny and not so clean. The breakfast starts at 7 am which was too late for us, because we had to leave before.
