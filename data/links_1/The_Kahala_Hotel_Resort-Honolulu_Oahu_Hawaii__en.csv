The staff was extremely helpful throughout our week's stay. The room was unbelievable with a great view. From an very comfortable bed (best night's sleep) to the heated toilet seats, cleanliness of the room, turndown service with chocolates and beautiful hotel grounds. This is a bucket list hotel for sure.

The service is impeccable, grounds are lovely and the right size so you are not walking a mile to get to the beach, the food is fantastic and the rooms are a great size with amenities. The little things like the housekeeper filling my ice bucket daily, making lei's into hearts on my bed, opening the gift store any hour you need all add up to a flawless vacation or event. Plus I love the location so you can easily reach Waikiki or less touristy areas. Grace in events and James in bell services are amazing at their attention to detail and the guest experience. Pete in the surf shop gives the best SUP lessons and everyone had a ball doing it. The retail shop has a ton of local brands that are thoughtfully curated and the BEST chocolate macadamia nuts anywhere on island. Plus it sets a nice mood every morning when you get to see the Dolphins swim.

Has one of the top restaurants in Hawaii - Hoku's w wonderful food and an even better view, expensive but worth it, also wonderful afternoon tea in the main foyer also, Plumeria Beach House restaurant on the Pool level has a buffet to die for and Arancino has delightful Italian food. You really don't have to leave the hotel for grand dining experiences. PLUS there are still dolphins in the lagoon and you can watch them all day long from your lounge by the pool, finally the beach is tremendous too, put all of that on top of great rooms with sea views and golf priv's at the Kohala country club (right beside the hotel) and you simply cannot beat a stay at the Kohala Hotel and Resort. Disclosure, Paradise does not come cheap, check the rates to be sure you are OK with the cost of the experience. If you try it, I think you'll feel like it is worth every dollar spent.

The beautiful leis that we each received (since framed when we came home), the great recommendations for meals and activities and finally their help with arranging a day trip to Pearl Harbor was fantastic. We had a fabulous ground floor room, with a view of both the ocean and the dolphins. Our room was very comfortable. Meals were very nice - loved eating as the sunset, overlooking the ocean. Go early for breakfast, the buffet is plentiful but can get super busy. We also went early to the pool so as to get seats away from the pools edge and looking out to the ocean. Loved the service there, help with lots of chair covers, umbrella and towels. We ate lunch and had drinks by the pool each day. My husband relaxed with a massage at the spa.

I was supposed to get married here, and was basically on the 1 yard line but with COVID-19, my fiancé and I had to make the unfortunate decision to cancel. I still wanted to drop by and leave a review, because I had a 5 star experience planning. Anna Hinkley was our catering manager, and she is amazing. She answered all my crazy questions, is extremely knowledgeable, and made the planning feel like a breeze. From our initial site tour up until cancellation, she was professional and very warm. Also, I think the way the Kahala is handling the weddings and cancellations is extremely professional amid the Coronavirus nightmare. I know my wedding would have been amazing here.

It was quiet and relaxing. We took the free shuttle to Waikiki a couple times and the driver was great and gave a guided tour as he drove. We found the food to be extremely over-priced at the hotel. With tax and tip, the breakfast buffet is well over $50 per person... (That’s over $100 just for breakfast!) and the cocktails at the poolside bar are about $20 each after tip. Because it’s secluded, there are no other food options within walking distance so we stocked up on groceries while at Waikiki and still spent $100/day for snacks and dinner. One more gripe and then on to the good stuff. The coffee was awful. I expect that from room coffee but it was the same coffee throughout the hotel. The room was very pretty and comfortable and we had a view of the dolphins below. We ate at Hoku’s on our anniversary and at the Italian restaurant twice. Delicious and beautiful food.

The atmosphere and staff were all very inviting from valet to front desk to housekeeping and room service. The concierge was great in organizing our 2 limos during our stay. The staff was very friendly, accommodating, and efficient. I felt that we were treated with respect and class, but also felt that our care was individualized and special. The resort is not located in Waikiki, which made for a much quieter and more relaxing stay. Despite its location, it is only a few minutes drive back to the hustle and bustle of the city. If you're not wanting to drive, they provide complimentary shuttles that can take you to Waikiki and other shopping areas. The rooms/suites had beautiful views of the ocean, city, and mountains. The view from our suite was amazing. The suite was well maintained and clean and the furniture and beds were comfortable and cozy. We appreciated that The Kahala offers a variety of highly rated and recommended dining experiences on property. We ate the breakfast buffet at the Plumeria Beach House.

We traveled with another couple and stayed for 9 nights; hence, we experienced most of what the Kahala had to offer. The professionalism, courtesy and attentiveness of the staff is what truly makes this resort special. Everyone goes out of their way to make your stay the best it can be. Wendy, the concierge, was particularly helpful and kind. She knew this was our first visit and she helped us to get the most out of our stay. Mayumi, one of the assistant managers, even accompanied us to our car upon departure. The housekeepers (10th floor) were always cheerful and attentive. Every morning, we were greeted and wished ""Aloha."" Robert, one of the attendants at the pool/sports rental station went above and beyond assisting me with snorkeling equipment.  The food was equally amazing. The daily breakfast buffet at Plumeria had so many tasty options. You could try something new every day. We also attended the seafood buffet at Plumeria on Valentine's Day. While pricey, the quality and abundance was top notch. The food at Hoku's, their signature seafood restaurant was inventive and delicious. Next, Arancino served excellent Italian food with a flare. Kevin, our waiter helped us to navigate the menu and ensure we had a excellent experience. The Veranda is their dining area in the lobby that extends onto a porch that overlooks the lagoon which is home to entertaining dolphins, and myriad fish. They serve excellent drinks and appetizer fare. They also have a terrific afternoon tea. Lastly, the Seaside Grille, near the pool and beach isn't your typical ""pool bar."" They also serve amazing sandwiches and salads. They serve some of the best fish tacos around. The rooms are spacious and ours had a full ocean view with a juliet balcony. The view was amazing. Waking up to a sunrise every morning is restorative. The bathroom had a separate shower and tub flanked by his and her vanities and closets.  The location of the hotel is east of Waikiki in a quiet neighborhood next to Waialae Country Club. The beach is pristine and picturesque as are the hotel grounds. Although it is off the beaten path (thankfully), it isn't a far drive to all of the sites. We recommend renting a car.

Everybody was really nice and friendly. Wendy at the concierge desk was amazing, and Kathy, Errol, Angie and Aaron at the Plumeria Bar were wonderful to talk to. Our room was large and comfortable, with lots of windows, but the bathroom was smallish with one sink and a tiny counter. Food and drinks were very expensive and it was a $15 Uber ride to Waikiki to eat at an offsite location. The breakfast buffet was excellent but $108 for two, with a tip. The food was generally good but we did not like the Italian restaurant...it seemed more Japanese than Italian. With a bottle of wine it was hard for two to eat dinner in the nicer restaurants for under $250. The only pool area was nice but very small, and there were lots of young children. The fitness facility was well supplied and quiet most of the time. This may be a pretty nice place for Oahu but, in our opinion, is not as nice as the resorts we have stayed at on Maui and Kauai.

Leading up to the wedding, the staff was extremely helpful and responsive, especially our Catering Manager Kristal Kikumoto. She went above and beyond to make sure our day was everything we wanted it to be, from ballroom layout to customizing our banquet menu, and corresponding with our wedding coordinator. The food was exceptional. I have had multiple guests of the wedding tell me that the food was the best they've ever eaten at an event. The Plumeria Grove for our reception was beautiful, overlooking the ocean, and the ballroom was gorgeous having an old-time glamour feel. In addition to the wedding, we had a hotel room block with a group rate. All of my guests loved staying at the resort. They raved about the views from their rooms, and the exceptional service. I had the pleasure of staying in one of the one-bedroom suites and it was beautiful. We had a view of the pool and ocean. The bed was super comfortable. The couch is even a pull out sleeper sofa, and my bridesmaids were able to stay with me the night before the wedding. There was also more than enough room to get ready, including makeup artists, bridesmaids, mothers, videographers, photographers, and wedding coordinators. The hotel itself just felt luxurious. One of the reasons I chose the Kahala was due to its location away from Waikiki. The beach was quiet and not very crowded, even for a three-day weekend, and made for perfect sunset beach pictures. Also, how many hotels can say they have a dolphin lagoon onsite? We loved watching the dolphins. I can't recommend this hotel enough.

Good seating available around the pool and on the beach, although it helps to secure a poolside lounge chair early for the best locations. The dolphin encounter experience on site is worth doing. The only reason that I have given the hotel 4 stars rather than 5 is because the management decided to hold a private event starting in the middle of the afternoon in the pool area on a Saturday, denying the hotel guests who have paid for full use of all the hotel's amenities access to the pool during those daylight hours.

The rooms are a little dated but they have a nice charm to them, are spacious and have good facilities and views (we stayed in 2 - a mountain view and a dolphin lagoon room). The pool area is lovely although could be bigger but then you have the beach right there. The buffet breakfasts were exceptionally good and I'm vegan and still found lots of options. All of our other meals on site were a high standard and featured great service and atmosphere (we dined at all except Hokus). The staff were incredibly accommodating and patient with our two young children (2 and 4 months). Prices are high (to us when comparing to home) but in line with other resorts and restaurants in the area and in our opinion better quality and service. Worth getting up to see the sunrise from the beach (and you can grab a complimentary coffee downstairs too before 8.30am). I also ran around Diamond Head from the resort.

We arrived at the hotel around 1pm and even though the check in time was 3 pm, Carolyn very kindly checked us in around 2pm.

We were spoilt rottenThe daily buffet breakfast at The Plumeria beach House was fit for a king topped with a million dollar view of the Pacific ocean. What a feast! Needless to mention, they have a great dinner and signature cocktail menu too. We had the famous Mai Tai cocktail at different places in Honolulu but Plumeria you pour the best Mai Tai ever. You guys take the prize. ❤Would also recommend their Kahala Sunrise and Coco Jito Freeze cocktails . ❤❤Alongside the Plumeria beach house restaurant is a semi private beautiful Kahala beach, swimming pool and the famous Kissing Point. Balmy shallow water, a fantastic place to relax and chill with a cocktail in hand watching the mesmerizing million dollar view of the sunset is a real treat for naked eyes. I must say the location of the resort is absolutely stunning and highly recommend it if one wants to avoid the noisy and busy Waikiki. Will definitely revisit this property again.

I came and had lunch and had a peaceful day just sitting and watching the dolphins. The resort is just regal! From the colorful, eccentric chandeliers to the ""botanical"" staircase. I had visited the spa gift shop and saw you have your signature spa robe for sale. I do not own a robe and was standing there trying to justify why I needed it. I knew I wanted something that would remind me of my visit. As I stood there, a kind lady working the counter was listening to me talk it through to myself with a smile on her face. She was funny and mentioned that every room had the robes and most guests like them so much, they come down to purchase them. Colette was so kind to take the robe off the mannequin ,so I could try it on. I bought it! As humid and hot as it is out, you better believe I put that sucker on at my daughter's! It makes me reflect on my time at your place and allows me to feel a little more special ;). Colette is a true asset to your team. I will always return here every visit. :)",,neenbliss,0,5.0

Although everything is well kept and maintained, the hotel has a dated feel to it.. kinda like watching a movie from the 70's on TNN. The pool is small and there are limited loungers available. It creates that awkward situation where you feel if you dont run down there early enough there will be nothing left but empty chairs with towels thrown over them to reserve them which is funny because some of them end up not really being used. The Hotel is also a 10+ minute drive in Honolulu traffic to get anywhere. Workable with Uber but a little inconvenient.

It was 5 Trip Advisor stars all the way. A classic landmark where you'd always see a Hollywood celebrity or two in the midst of an interesting group of world-class travelers who appreciated the cool 1960's vibe of the Kahala. It ain't that hotel anymore. I'm giving it 3 TA stars due to my affection for what it used to be and my memories of a better-run establishment. It was a unique 5 star city hotel that just happened to be on a beach (as opposed to a fancy cookie-cutter over-the-top outer island resort), which was its charm and why it ended up ranked CN Traveler's best hotel in Hawaii 20 years ago. Now it's not even in the top 30. instead, it's become a mid-level Japanese chain hotel that barely ranks as a 4 star. The owners/management either don't know how to run a world-class hotel (since they've owned it for 5 years or so, they should), or aren't interested in spending the money to do so. The latter is my guess.I've stayed here at least a dozen times in 28 years. First, when it was the fading old Kahala Hilton (which people loved even though it was falling apart...I guess history repeats itself), then as the newly redone and wonderful Mandarin Oriental, and now, as the sad flagship of the above-mentioned chain. I'm very sorry to say, this place is being let go. It looks tired and unkempt. Pros: The Location. It's on a beautiful, quiet beach 4 miles from Waikiki in one of Honolulu's best neighborhoods (or at least it was the best before a Japanese billionaire started destroying it house by house... but that's another fascinating story... he ultimately got sent to jail).The Design. If you love 1960's mid-century modern architecture, you will love the circa 1964 style. It really is a classic.Some of the Staff. A Front Desk Clerk named Given (which is his... given name) is a super nice guy who was extremely helpful with check-in.No Resort Fee. That really is appreciated... and it's the way things should be!Cons: Tacky add-ons and deferred maintenance!Where do I start? Boy, have they tarted up the pure, simple design. They have tacky Z Gallerie level brown (!) furniture in the beautiful, 2-story open air lobby, which is now lit from above with harsh spots that cast an eerie glow on what once was a magical area. There is a tacky metal awning over the outdoor deck off the lobby that looks like it cost $1.50. There is cheap all-weather wicker furniture strewn all across that deck... which was never arranged properly once during my stay. It's always just scattered about. They added tacky blue lighting to the entrance, which clashes with the warm glow of the tiki torches (which they turn off at 10 pm to save on... gas?). There is also incredibly cheap-looking strip lighting under the front entrance stairs. Let me not forget to mention the prison-yard spots that light up the beach area by the restaurant and pool at night. The palms on both peninsulas that frame the beach used to be elegantly lit up at night but all the spotlights have rusted and shorted out. The bulk of the beach area is really dark at night, and there was zero security (as opposed to previous visits). There are multiple cheesy plastic towel dispensers/receptacles blocking the view of the beach from lounge chairs and the rooms. The beach attendants also stacked little side tables on top of each other that block views from the pool. They were stacked there the whole week I stayed. The carpets in the elevator are filthy. There are dead bugs in the elevator's overhead lighting panels. The carpet in the hallway is not clean. The doors at the ends of each hall are so rusted they no longer close. The room carpet is dirty. They added fans to the ceilings and ran the wiring in plastic conduit tacked up along the walls and ceilings. You don't see this in a Hamptons Inn or even a low-rent apartment building. The room furniture cushions were stained. There is an odd chaise lounge in each room that is positioned awkwardly. In fact, all the furniture minus the desk chairs looks on the cheap side and is old and funky. Upon entering, the room smelled a little mildewy, to be honest. The AC makes a weird squeaking noise every time it cycles on. The one positive... the beds are very comfortable, as are the pillows. Alas, the sheets are discolored and don't match. The bathrooms are from 1996... literally... not touched in 24 years. The grout is coming off the white tile, the red granite counters are fading. There are hard water stains on the glass shower. There were the fewest towels of any beach resort hotel I've ever visited. At most, 2 or 3 in a room. And they are not plush ones. The Japanese washlet toilets are noisy and smell like burning plastic due to the heated seats. Also, they're so noisy in the middle of the night I finally had to unplug mine. To make matters worse, the bathrooms are painted a weird yellow color which makes everything look even cheaper. As for the staff, the bellhops/valets (and there's always 4 or 5 around who are usually not that busy) never said hello once -- well, maybe once -- as I entered or left the hotel. Isn't that basic etiquette for a 5 star hotel. To be welcomed? Other staffers were usually quite friendly, including Jacquie at the front desk and the very sweet housekeeper. They did seem to care about your stay. It looked like there was not much pool service, though. (And it's an absurdly small pool, but it always was!) There certainly aren't enough staff at the pool & beach to keep anything looking neat. All the lounge chairs are left askew at night with towels uncollected. Also, for some reason, there were several white couches left adrift on the lawn that get soggy when it rains and have mildew on their pillows as a result. Ewww.Some others have noted the Dolphin experience is upsetting... I'm used to zoos and I do believe they treat the animals well, but no one seems to be paying the exorbitant fees to swim with them anymore, so that suggests either attitudes are changing or maybe it's the fact that they are charging so much for the interaction. There is no resort fee, as I mentioned above, which is nice as is the free wifi. However, it costs $40 to park (self or valet) every night and there is NOT enough self-parking even when the overall garage isn't full. Employees are allowed to park in the same small self-parking area so you are fighting with them for parking during the day. Why not just let employees park on the top level of the garage, which was always empty of cars? Now that the Kahala is no longer tied into any major upscale hotel chain reservation system but rather is Japanese owned and operated, the vast majority of the guests were Japanese, which added an interesting, international flavor to the hotel, which I really appreciated. The downside is the room service and dining menus reflect a less American palate... which means some basics are missing in action. Have I mentioned the prices? If you don't have a car and leave the property for every meal you are going to spend a fortune for mediocre food.The problem is, the Kahala is just not very well-run any longer and the current owners are slowly letting it fall apart. If anything that's been updated, it has not been done with any sense of aesthetics that honor the original design. Perhaps the worst add-on is the tacky Italian restaurant under the rooms adjacent to the hotel entrance. It just looks so out of place and again, cheap. (But it's not!).Until recently, this was by far the most elegant hotel on Oahu. The Four Seasons chain was even interested in taking over after Mandarin left. But I didn't even realize how far the Kahala has fallen until I went to the Halekulani on Waikiki for a visit... that is the hotel the Kahala used to compete with for clientele and it seems those guests are now all at the Halekulani, not here. And the Kahala has such a much better beach and location. I really hope there's new ownership soon, because I don't think the current regime is capable of stewarding this Hawaiian classic back to its former glory. I doubt I'll return till new owners are in place, but I will always have a fond spot for the Kahala due to past fantastic experiences here. For now, it's disappointing and overall, a sad waste of a once-great one-of-a-kind property.I had an okay stay but my visits used to be sublime. I would only recommend the Kahala these days if you can see past all the myriad of imperfections and want to enjoy an Oahu hotel that's not in Waikiki or Ko Olina (don't get me started on that location) and if you can get a good deal, which occasionally appears to be possible. This really was my favorite hotel on earth, hence the lengthy review. I'm that bummed.","Santa Monica, California","andrew-s-wood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California</strong>",569,3.0

Our family just returned from a week at this beautiful resort. From the moment I made reservations by phone almost 7 months ago, I had the feeling that this would be a special place. Never having been to Hawaii before, during the weeks before our trip, I called the concierge a few times to get ideas for the planning of our trip. All of the concierge's friendly recommendations were spot on: a luau at Diamond Head Luau, a private island tour with Kiawe Adventures, swimming with dolphins at Dolphin Quest, and a family portrait session with Pacific Dream Photography - all were top notch in every way!When we arrived at the hotel after a long eleven hour flight from New York, we were exhausted and hungry. We were greeted with a warm greeting at the front desk, and each of us was given a lei, while our luggage was delivered to our rooms. Special kudos to the hostess at the Veranda restaurant who welcomed us in on a busy night even though we did not have a reservation and who also gave us a warm goodbye on our last evening at the hotel! We found that type of sincere, warm, caring attention at every step along the way throughout the week, even though the hotel was heavily booked for the PGA Sony Classic golf tournament at the adjoing Waialae Golf Club. All of the hotel restaurants at which we ate were first-rate as well (we ate in all of them except for Hoku's which is the hotel's signature restaurant - we had most of our breakfasts and dinners at The Plumeria, two dinners at the Veranda and lunches at Seaside Grill and Arancino - all of which were excellent).The rooms were excellent. The arrangement worked extremely well - the adjoining rooms had a small common entry area with two sets of doors - outer and interior. For unrelated guests, the outer doors could be left open, leaving the conventional hotel room doors (the inner doors) closed. For related guests the outer doors could be closed, leaving the interior doors open to effectively create a quasi-suite. The beds were extremely comfortable, the bathrooms were large and elegantly appointed, the linens were exceptional. The flat-screen wall mounted televisions were affixed to the wall with a swinging bracket so that the television could be adjusted to any angle of the room (although we didn't watch it much). Housekeeping (both morning and turn-down) was extremely attentive and our rooms were immaculate.The beach is extremely beautiful. Although Hawaiian beaches are not private, this hotel's beach effectively functions that way because of the surrounding geography. One of the main reasons we chose this hotel was because we read online that the pool and beach are generally not crowded. Since we arrived after the holidays, we practically had the beach to ourselves most days, with just a handful of guests there. Since the large waves break over the reefs parhaps a few hundred yards offshore, the water is fairly tranquil. The pool is beautiful and warm, and there is a bar and casual outdoor restaurant adjacent to it. Again, the service for the beach, pool and restaurant are all top-notch.We made a reservation for our family with Dolphin Quest, which is at a small lagoon between the hotel and the pool. There are a number of options, but we chose the option that allowed the most time with the dolphins. The experience of swimming with, playing with, feeding and even hugging a dolphin is one of those bucket list type of things that I will never forget - special kudos to our knowledgeable and friendly dolphin guide Alexa! This experience is not to be missed!We also made an appointment for a family portrait session with the hotel's resident photographers Pacific Dream Photography - kudos to Yuki for squeezing us in on short notice! The pictures are fabulous!We had read about the fact that the hotel is a favorite among celebrities. I will not name names, for the sake of privacy, but my son spotted a very big name star having breakfast with friends at the table next to us in the Plumeria restaurant (which is excellent) and he was gracious enough to say hello to my sons and take a picture with them when he was leaving the restaurant after breakfast.There is a long corridor near the hotel lobby with pictures and/or autographs of many, many celebrities who have stayed there.The only thing I would have done differently is that I would not have rented a car - there is no need for one. The hotel has a shuttle, and Uber service is plentiful in the area. The hotel is close enough to Honolulu and Waikiki if you want to go there by cab or hotel shuttle, but it is located in a quiet, upscale suburban residential neighborhood and provided the peaceful tranquility that we sought.In summary, our stay was absolutely flawless and we look forward to future stays at this world class gem of a resort.",,507thomasi,1,5.0

The rooms are nice, getting a little dated, but large, clean, have comfy beds, and are well-maintained. Every staff member we encountered, especially the front desk staff, was terrific. The service is really what keeps a nice hotel a step above. Parking is convenient, albeit pricey (but similar in price to other properties in the area), but we knew that when booking so it wasn't a negative. Grounds are beautiful and well manicured and the beach is terrific. It's not the best beach on the island, but its a nice little beach nonetheless and obliviously very convenient and enjoyable as a guest at the hotel. The neighborhood is very quiet and peaceful as well, which is nice since we didn't want a property on Waikiki beach or anything similar.What could be improved you might ask? Well, a few things; nothing major, but there's always room. First off, for the beach, simply have the beds sitting out; don't make me go to the hut and ask for one. I know some people might like that ""pampered"" feeling of not having to do anything at all for themselves, but I'd much rather save the few minutes and grab one that's already available. Self-parking is another thing with a similar issue; not enough space is available for it. I'd rather get in and out myself quickly than have to wait for a valet either way. There's plenty of self-parking space at night, but during the day it seems to be shared with employee parking, so as employees show up to work for the day the available spaces quickly disappear and you're forced to valet. Yes, it's the same price and I don't mind tipping a valet, I simply like to park myself. The Valets, which we had to use a few times, were all great though, don't get me wrong, just personal preference.Overall and great, fun, and relaxing stay. Would definitely recommend.","Germantown, Wisconsin","dr_j_now</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Germantown, Wisconsin</strong>",214,5.0

It really is an amazing hotel. That doesnt mean that there arent things that can be improved (read on) but we had a really lovely stay here. I had a good feeling before I arrived as for the better part of a year Leimomi at the concierge desk helped plan our trip which was to celebrate our 25th wedding anniversary. Nothing was too much trouble for her and she helped make sure that it was a very memorable trip. The hotel itself is beautifully located on the water and whilst one might argue that parts of the hotel may need a bit of an upgrade, overall its very clean and the rooms are nice and definitely a comfortable size. All of the staff are friendly and helpful, and the food across the hotel is excellent.So where could the hotel improve? Lets be clear, this is a VERY expensive hotel and for the price everything should be perfect. For that reason, the wait to get into breakfast if you dont get there early is very annoying. There was an overflow on some days but not every day, and one day we waited nearly 30 minutes to get a table. Surely the hotel knows that during busy times they need to step up their game in this respect? For $1000+ a night, who wants to wait for breakfast?Secondly, they have a VERY weird system to get beds on the beach. You basically need to queue up and reserve beds at 8am. Once you have a reservation you are all set and you dont even need to show up until 12, 1, 2pm - no one else can use the bed. Its all very strange and it isnt explained to anyone on arrival. Again, who wants to pay $1000 for a hotel room and then have to go on a waiting list to get a sun bed? Finally, the food by the pool - which is EXCELLENT by the way - took over an hour to come. Again, surely the owners know that the hotel is busy over Christmas? Why not plan ahead and ensure more staff to give better service.Please dont let the negatives put you off though. We had such a memorable stay here. It really is a bit of paradise for a few days. We'd go back in a flash if we return to Hawaii.

I grew up just blocks away from the Kahala (used to be The Kahala Hilton) in its heyday. It was definitely a five or more star hotel then. That was 20+ years ago. My parents still live there and this is a perfect spot to be able to return and work in a beach vacation over the holidays. However, I was expecting that five-star hotel at over $1100 per night and got what I would say was a three-star experience. While the location is still one of the best in the world, the hotel badly needs a renovation. The rooms are extremely dated, the plumbing can be heard through the walls and the layout of the rooms are awkward and funky to say the least. We had to move once during our 7-day stay, so we got a glimpse of two room-types. (The room-move was a bummer, but we appreciated Jacqui’s efforts to try to do better for us.). The bathroom fixtures are old and in disrepair and the stone work and tiles are from the 70’s. The air conditioning in our second room was permanently set to 64 degrees, so we would walk into what felt like a refrigerator, and the only way to warm it was to turn off the AC and open the door to our balcony. There was a window over our bed that had Venetian blinds which were obviously not black-out, despite the black-out curtains. Therefore we were unable to sleep-in on the one morning we had to relax. The owners should really consider hiring a great architect and re-working the resort. They should also seriously consider setting the dolphins free and doing away with the lagoon to gain some much needed space. It wouldn’t take much to gut the spacious guest rooms in the tower, transforming into elegant island contemporary rooms by changing the layout and furniture and modernizing the bathrooms. The restaurant facilities are wonderful as is the staff, but I’d like to come back and stay if they just spent a bit of money and effort on the rooms experience.","Newport Beach, California","cydsworld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport Beach, California</strong>",53,2.0

Really peaceful. We also loved the fact that they have transport to Honolulu, Ala Moana Shopping Center and other go-to places. The property is old Hawaiian and it's decor lovely. We found the rooms a little dated for our taste but they sleep comfortably, have lovely amenities, and fabulous views. I will tell you they also pour the best mai tai on the planet. Check in was swift though our room wasn't ready and they made us wait until precisely 3 pm. Not to quibble we had a lovely lunch seaside and our check in was smooth and easy. The restaurants on property are lovely though we had a not so great lunch at the beach-side property on one of the three days we ate their. We aren't a fan of their buffet and felt the food was so so. Their 'fine dining is actually a bit loud, no table clothes and service so so. The food was lovely but we had our best meals at the italian restaurant on property which isn't technically affiliated with the property. It's delicious.  Shopping on property was lovely and there is ample choices for everyone. I liked this property but i didn't love it. It would be hard for me to skip Halekulani when we go back. It remains my favorite but i get the appeal of Kahala which is quiet, out of the way, yet so close to everything. If the rooms were remodeled we'd be all over it. But i think for the money (we paid top price) and for the location the beach views should come with modernized rooms that feel fresh especially in the bathrooms which have dated closets, bath vanities and toilet area.The layout is little odd. Restaurants good but not 5 star. Good but not great. It's a very good experience. Solid 4 star. Lovely serenity and a great night's sleep. Views can't be beat.

I went back and forth trying to decide between hotels on Waikiki Beach and the Kahala and I’m so glad I decided on the latter. Waikiki Beach is a little Miami-ish and not the vibe I was looking for. The Kahala is not in a walkable area, but when you arrive it’s heavenly and beautiful and that’s exactly what I wanted. If you rent a car, which you should if possible it’s not an issue.  The hotel is very impressive on arrival, the grounds are perfectly manicured, and the décor is amazing. While the style is not super modern it doesn’t take away from the elegance. The rooms are comfortable, and my room had a balcony that faced a golf course. I must mention the heated toilet seats/bidet which is becoming more and more common but since it was an older hotel, I didn’t expect it and that shower!! After a long flight and days at the beach that shower was a cure-all! There is even a lagoon with dolphins on the property! That was super cool! All the staff we encountered was polite and very kind. I don’t remember anyone’s name, but the front desk ladies were always friendly, the young lady out front by the valet counter and the valet guys were all great! They work hard and always have a friendly smile.  We tried as many restaurants as possible in the island but also ate in the hotel a few times. Arancino, which is in the property was very nice, I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. We arrived on a Wednesday night and only chose it because of its location. I did not like that the hostess said there was no availability (on a Wednesday night) and it was clear that most of the tables were empty. She asked whether we were staying in the hotel and when I answered yes, she immediately found a table and as I suspected most of the tables remained empty for the rest of the night. The Asian restaurant was simply amazing, every dish we had was delicious, the service was just as great, and we would’ve returned had we not wanted to try different places outside of the hotel. The breakfast was a ripoff, $86 for two subpar egg dishes, you’re better off going out and trying local places, which we did and were happier.  The Beach is great, not as clear as Waikiki beach but calm and great for swimming and pictures. We explored the island and did not lack beautiful beaches so it was fine for just lounging around.This hotel is a winner for me and I enjoyed my time in Hawaii very much. I would definitely return and recommend it. If you are looking for a walkable hotel, near shops and restaurants or in a more touristy area, then Waikiki is a better option.

The property is definitely older, and can use some upgrades, but the elegance and sophistication still exists throughout the property. Most importantly, the service is five star. From the hotel manager, Bart, to the front desk staff, to concierge staff like Dean, to the housekeepers—everyone makes your stay enjoyable, and you do get to feel like royalty.  Our room—a one bedroom, two bath suite was quite large and very tastefully decorated, and was classical style, rather than modern as many hotels are today—big plush chairs, and a large balcony with great mountain and ocean views. The bathrooms were older—with white tile—but quite large. In fact, we had a large tub in each bathroom. We were welcomed with some chocolate macadamia nuts and fruit—a nice gesture. Housekeeping cleaned well twice a day, and constantly replenished water. The food and drink poolside was tasteful and served timely, they had a cool button to push at you pool chair when you wanted a server to come by. The problem with the resort grounds was the condition of the pool and jacuzzi, which definitely need remodel, but the proximity of the pool area to the ocean and beach (100 feet) is amazing for families with kids who constantly go between pool and ocean all day long. The seclusion of the beach also gives parents a feel of safety and security for their family—since The beach is essential private.  The big draw at the Kahala is the Dolphins—right next to the pool, and viewed easily from many rooms is the dolphin lagoon—there Are around 6 dolphins that swim most of the day in clear view. And then our kids did the Dolphin Quest—a great in water swimming experience with the dolphins—and All of this is just steps from you seats at the pool—so Everything is convenient at the Kahala. The reason I didn’t give a five star review was because of the condition of certain parts of the property. The management tells me they are planning renovations, and if they do, this property would be hard to beat in Oahu, both for couples and families. So, I definitely recommend this property as the “Waikiki alternative”","Las Vegas, Nevada","dermalux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",13,4.0

Yes, it can be expensive but they have some wonderful specials which we take full advantage of which makes relaxing in the lap of luxury possible. As I have noted, any time you come is wonderful.

We live in Australia and didn't have a Hawaii based wedding planner so it was great to be able to work directly with Anna and get things organised so simply and without any stress. Anna also accommodated our preference to communicate solely via email which was really appreciated.Anna even assisted us on our wedding day and helped with the ceremony. It was really nice to have her there to witness the ceremony since we had no family or friends present.

The staff there are kind and helpful, especially ‘Nozomi’.In our room, we had an incredible view with a nice view of the dolphins. Whilst the prices to swim with the dolphins were extortionate, we did manage to get a free experience with them when my hat blew into the water and one of the dolphins took it for a swim.Moving on to breakfast which I feel really lets the resort down big time, so much so that it doesn’t even feel like it’s part of the hotel. Just to name a few issues here, it’s dirty with birds bouncing everywhere and mouth outlines still on glasses. It’s also overpriced with not a lot of food options.The staff are also clueless on the whole. For example, if you ask for a normal thin crape, you are getting a stack of the thickest crapes you’ve ever seen.The only nice staff member at breakfast was ‘Carol’.To round off this review, the hotel also has 3 sources of wi-fi which is always good.",,Re_Journey,35,3.0

We actually were booked at another five-star resort on Oahu and ended up checking out minutes after checking in. I had always heard of The Kahala Resort but had never stayed there. We inquired and Bart, the front desk Manager invited us to come and show us several room categories that were available.From the minute we arrived we felt like we were in an Oasis of peace and tranquility in comparison to the other hotel we had booked.Ying and Bart quickly and seamlessly checked us in even though we were a last-minute reservation. Bart brought us personally to the concierge desk to ensure we could get a table at the extremely-booked AranCina restaurant. We decided on a ground-floor ocean-front room with direct access to the flawless and pristine beach.Our luggage arrived immediately thanks to the wonderful Bellman Alex!It was dusk and we immediately jumped into the beautiful ocean during the magical hour of sunset. From that moment on I realized this was the best ocean-front resort I had been to in the North American / Pacific Rim region.Our room was beautiful and elegant. Our Housekeeper Venus was an Angel! She tended to every detail and took such good care of us every day!!! Thanks to Luce and Erlinda also from the Housekeeping team who helped with some special requests.We enjoyed a lovely meal at AranCina. Our Server Alben took extra special care of us and organized a personal customized pizza for us. Guillermo and McKenzie were also very attentive. Fantastic service and food!The Beach Team arrived everyday with smiles to put towels on our chairs. Thank you Amanda, Jenny, and all the team for taking such good care of us!We love good food and Nozomi and Cameron and all the concierge team made some fantastic recommendations including The Kahala Signature restaurant Hokus which we highly recommend.We would like to give special thanks to the Room Service Team! As we had a beach-front room we enjoyed a lot of room service breakfasts and one dinner. Thank you Helena, Eddie, Jay, John, Kwong, and the whole team for all the details and all the genuine smiles!!! So much Aloha in that team!!!The management team were all very engaged and present. During our stay we were graciously greeted by the Resort Manager Joey Ibarra. He had heard about our sudden decision to leave the other hotel and come to The Kahala and wanted to make sure we were enjoying our stay. Oh boy were we ever!! This was one of our favorite beach vacations ever!The Rooms Divistion Manager Steve Tabiolo and the Chief Engineer Pat Silva also made a point to introduce themselves to us and ask if everything was up to our expectations.Our response was: ""No, our expectations have not been met, they have been massively surpassed""!!

I stayed here because I had family members who were at the adjacent condos. I had never stayed in the Kahala area and I liked it. It has a neighborhood feel, close to a shopping mall, and not too far from Waikiki or Hawaii Kai. During my entire stay the hotel entrance/lobby was transformed into a film set for the upcoming TV movie “Same Time, Next Christmas,” so I guess this year’s Christmas holiday season started early for me. Not a big deal. I had a comfortable bedroom and spacious bathroom. The hotel has a nice fitness room and men’s steam, sauna, whirlpool relaxation area, although it is separate from the spa treatment area which prevented me from getting a massage. I prefer they be in the same area. Management should know, if they don’t already, that the retail Chi Fitness room has a window that looks directly into the men’s hot tub area which is clothing optional. The window has bamboo blinds but they were open when I walked in. Totally inappropriate. In addition to this voyeur window, the hotel had way too many kids (which I expected since it’s not adults only) and way too many weddings (like 4/day). I had a better time relaxing at the adjacent condo pool area.","Walnut Creek, California","JustinDonald</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walnut Creek, California</strong>",25,4.0

With that in mind, I decided go here. This is an island legend and known to be one of the best resorts on Oahu. It is away from Waikiki without being too far away from all that Honolulu has to offer. The Kahala definitely maintains a vintage feel with elegance, though some of the common areas are showing wear, particularly the furniture. The pool and beach area are great because they are within feet of each other and you park in your chair and go to back anf forth to both throughout the day. Additionally, they offer food and drink service both on the beach and at the pool.What impressed me the most about my stay was the incredible staff. every single staff member was always smiling and cheerful and learned my name. The housekeeping staff was very responsive cleaning my room early by request. I hosted local friends at the Hoku's Sunday brunch, and while expensive, it was excellent food and service and my guests ate their weight in lobster and crab and clearly enjoyed their meal as did I. I also particpated in the dolphin program. I was hesitant due to the price but in the end I booked the ""Dolphin Encounter"" and it was worth every single minute. We were in the water with the dolphins the entire time, but, (thankfully) at no time did we hold on to them to swim. It is trully an opporunity to interact alongside with these lovely creatures.

We came from the Four Seasons on the Big Island and it was an oasis with the most attentive service. So when we arrived at the Kahala we had expected the same type of service. Not so much. No bell man seemed interested when our taxi pulled up so we carried our own luggage through the busy lobby to the not so well marked reception desk. We waited in line and then while the person behind the desk was friendly she was not particularly helpful. We arrived around noon and our room was not ready. This was a big disappointment since we were only in Oahu for two nights so we had only a day and a half to enjoy the resort. We had planned to go to our room and head off to the beach and explore. They offered us the use of the hospitality suite while we waited for our room to be ready (after the bellman had already stored our luggage). The reception desk did not really give us directions to the hospitality suite or how it worked. So we had to figure out how to get our bags from the bellman and find the hospitality suite. The hospitality suite only had two small changing rooms (which were in use) so we had to change in the bathroom. It was less than ideal. Then we had to get the bellman back to store our luggage again. It was a hot and annoying start to the stay. When we got to the pool/beach area it was chaotic and busy. It was not what we had expected. We had lunch and played in the ocean and it made us feel a bit better but not really relaxed. We finally got our room at three. Which was just enough time to get changed and ready for our 4pm dolphin experience. The dolphin experience was awesome. We had a great time. And our room was excellent (1217 overlooking the dolphin pond). The room was large and spacious. The housekeeping was also super efficient. They got us extra towels within 5 minutes of asking for them and also got us a pull away bed - also within minutes of asking. I would highly recommend the rooms overlooking the dolphins. We were on the second floor and from our balcony had an excellent view of the dolphins swimming. In the morning we had fun watching them playing with each other for hours. Room service breakfast was fast and good. And the service at the beach was great. We did not get to the beach until around 10:30 so I was worried we would not find a place to sit in the shade. No need to worry. They found us four chairs in the shade under some trees on a grassy part of the beach. It was a lovely day at the beach. The water is great for kids. Not much sea life to look at but an easy place for kids to play safely in the ocean. On the whole we enjoyed our stay but would not plan for an relaxing check in and I would not plan on the hospitality suite being all that hospitable. ,"Highland Park, Texas","dallastexastraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Highland Park, Texas</strong>",43,4.0

The dolphin lagoon was such a treat to experience (thru Dolphin Quest) and the kids loved seeing the dolphins and sea turtles daily.

It literally is in the backyard of the resort. The views are amazing from the waterfall to the sea turtles. The only kind of misleading thing is the dolphins. From reading I had the impression you would be seeing the dolphins swim, twirl and interact with them. That only happens if you pay to do an activity with them. Or you can watch them when they are interacting/performing for a group that paid for an activity. Otherwise you don't see them. I paid for my youngest daughter to get to do the dolphin experience and it was well worth the money though! It's a memory that will last her a lifetime!!! We surely enjoyed all the perks from the nightly turn down service, robes and even the housekeeping went the extra mile and folded the clothes we left out. Which I wouldn't expect of them but was pleased with the gesture. The concierge took care of anything we asked and even accommodated us for the Sunday Seafood brunch even though they were full. We also dinned downstairs for dinner and our server Cliff was AMAZING! Very helpful explaining the menu, offering tips and suggestions. They made a virgin style drink for the kids so they could drink out of the exotic pineapple. Cliff packed up all of our food at the end to go and treated us so wonderful! All of us left with smiles and very happy with our service. Lastly, the shuttle service is a great help. The drivers name is slipping my mind at the moment but he is very knowledgeable and very nice. They recommend scheduling a day ahead of time and that is smart to do. They only have one shuttle and it is on the smaller side. BUT they will try to accommodate you if they can.

All my years on island, this resort has always had a certain prestige, an air, if you will. Last night, celebrating our anniversary, we took the plunge and splurged. Over a thousand dollars a night for an oceanfront room. The view was spectacular. Not unlike any other waterfront resort on island but gorgeous nonetheless. So the hotel is older so keep that in mind when looking at the finishes. The furniture, dated, as well as the tiled bathroom. Not a deal breaker. The grounds are quite lovely. Swim with the dolphins, watch the honu and tropical fish swim, relax by the pool or sit at the beach. All things we had hoped to experience. Unfortunately for us, we chose to eat on site. We ate at Plumerias. Noise level was acceptable. Our table was nice. View of the ocean. Not a bad start to the evening, so I thought. I was excited to see bone marrow offered at the carving station. I indulged in bone marrow, sashimi, lobster bisque, various cheeses and other items. Then the unthinkable happened. We headed back to our room because shortly after dinner, my husband and I fell ill. I spent the whole rest of our stay praying to the porcelain god. I will spare you the excruciating details. Long story short, I was dying to go home. I was miserable. We weren't able to enjoy the facilities, the whole reason for booking a room. No playing in the pool, no walk along the beach, no drinks at the bar, just balled up in bed hoping for the nightmare to end. Morning finally came and I, food motivated, couldn't even bring myself to eat. Exhausted and miserable, I just wanted to go home.

I understand that Kahala wants to keep the essence of the Hawaiian cultural in it’s decor, but they can keep that while renovating as other hotels/resorts has done. They also need to re-sand the beach and make the pool bigger. One thing going for them is the service. Second to none. I would say, it’s on par with Four Seasons and that’s saying a lot.

Japanese food options at the breakfast buffet. (amazing breakfast buffet). The grounds are compact and nicely kept up. A pool and Jacuzzi which we did not use. The warm pacific ocean is 50 feet away. Cocktail bar outside, kayak and paddle board rentals. Golf course, spa etc. My only complaint is that they have a ""swim withe dolphins"" program which of course means they have captive dolphins.

Staff was super helpful and nice. We were there for a conference - my wife was working and I was the plus 1. Not a great fit as anything the conference didn't pay for was out of range of most business traveler budgets. The remote location also makes it hard to use as a base if you want to tour O'ahu.

I am bothered by things that most people would ignore, so I am very difficult to please. So when I come across a hotel where I can't find anything to complain about it is a reason to celebrate. I read a few negative reviews on TripAdvisor which alarmed me so I contacted the hotel via email. My email was responded to promptly, my concerns were addressed, and I was assured I had nothing to worry about. When I arrived at my room (Beachfront Lanai) it was spectacular. It was spotlessly clean, beautifully appointed and very comfortable. Some reviewers complained that the furnishings were “tired” or needed updating, but I did not find that to be the case whatsoever. The furnishings were beautiful and appropriate to a Hawaiian hotel. In addition, the staff, from the general manager on down, were beyond nice and accommodating. The Plumeria restaurant is situated on the most beautiful ocean front site one could imagine. The breakfast buffet is delicious. The round waffles that are made fresh at the site of the omelette station during the week are the most delicious waffles I have ever tasted. They are different than the a la carte waffles, or the ones made on the weekends (which are also good, but not the same).

We couldn’t run fast enough to the pool area and the amazing views of the beach and the sand. Because my kid was traveling alone with me, I wanted him engaged with kids as much as possible. We signed up for the full day Keiki Club on three different occasions. Their execution is flawless, as my kid had a wonderful day under strict supervision while he enjoyed the resort with other kids from around the world. The restaurants are first class. This is evident by employees that have been there for over 40 years. That period of retention is almost unheard in the hospitality industry and it just goes to show you that they love their job.

My wife and I were celebrating our wedding anniversary and couldn’t have had a better time over the 10 days we were there. FIVE BIG STARS ALL AROUND!! The property itself is stunning with a beautiful secluded beach, gorgeous gardens everywhere, a great pool area, and a completely unique and amazing dolphin and green turtle sanctuary where a group of highly trained marine biologists offer educational and specialized emersion programs for hotel guests and visitors. A real highlight of the property! There are a number of outstanding restaurants on the property including Arancino’s for incredible Italian fare and Huko’s for more traditional Hawaiian cuisine. We highly recommend both! As much as we could go on about the physical features of the property, by far the most noticeable feature was the incredible service and hospitality we received from virtually every member of the resort team. From check in where Steve Tabiolo, Director of Front Office Operations, personally handled our accommodations, placing us in a beautiful ocean front suite with a great lanai, to Carlos Penaherrera, Guest Services Supervisor, who very politely helped us with a number of requests, to Anji at the pool bar and Dean at the concierge desk, both who gave us great recommendations of places to go and restaurants to try, the exceptional attention to detail and personal attention we received from every resort staff member we encountered made this trip one of the very best experiences we have enjoyed.

We arrived to a dirty and dreadful airbnb in Waikiki. What a shock! As my son put it, ""you go on vacation to escape your reality... but not like this"". We would have rather stayed at home. Bad planning on my part I suppose. The pictures made it look so much nicer than it actually was. After no response from the manager, friends from Seattle recommended we call the Kahala Hotel & Resort. Lucky for us there was a room available for 3 nights. When we arrived at the Kahala we were greeted with the Aloha we'd traveled so far for. Such a relief I nearly cried when they place the flower leis over our heads. We could hardly believe the difference it made. From the moment we stepped into the lobby we knew we were in for a real treat. Gina at the front desk was so welcoming. The kids and I knew right away that our vacation had offically begun. All Mom's stress from the disappointment of the day drifted away in that moment. Sure, the resort was twice the price but it was well worth the spurge. Sometimes you get what you pay for. The room was clean and comfortable. The friendly and helpful staff provided a roll away made up nicely in the corner of our ample king size room with lovely views overlooking the palm trees. We immediately felt at peace. My daughter said it felt like serenity. Smiles all around. There was a mini fridge for drinks and snacks. The bathroom had two large vanities with separate sinks - one for me, one for the kids to share. There were to small closets and a large dressing area with shelves for all our things. The separate toilet closet had a heated seat that did everything for you just like a Japanese spa. We settled in and stepped outside onto a calm beautiful beach with lounge chairs and tables by the pool. This was a real vacation. The shuttle to and from Waikiki was an added bonus. We were able to enjoy the hustle and bustle of the city and then come back to paradise. Thanks to the Kahala for making this a family vacation to remember and for making the first few hours utterly forgettable.

The service was the most phenomenal I’ve experienced. Especially the bellmen, front desk, room service, restaurant staff, and concierge. They were so friendly, professional, pleasant, and accommodating. Cameron and Nazome (concierges) helped us plan more activities even though we already had some tours booked and made all the necessary calls while we were out enjoying our day. They made great recommendations of things we enjoyed doing and saved our trip when our prescheduled all day tour did not pick us up. They helped us rearrange and reschedule all the other activities we had planned so we could do our all day trip another day. The beach and pool area were beautiful and it was cool just to sit and watch the fish, dolphins, and turtles in the beautiful garden even though we didn’t participate in dolphin quest. The Kahala was so peaceful and quiet and service was much better and more personalized than at the hotels we visited in Waikiki. SO glad we didn’t stay at one of those- it was nuts and crowded, loud, and hard to move around when we were at the Hilton Hawaiian village for a boat tour. Most of our tours picked us up at the Kahala and the Kahala has a free shuttle into Waikiki so staying outside of it didn’t inhibit us really and we were glad we did. Occasionally we wanted to do something special or at a time when the shuttle wasn’t running a chose to take a can for about 30 dollars. Uber would be cheaper and you could probably manage doing activities without splurging for a cab. We have limited mobility so also chose to do that when we may have been able to walk to or from Kahala shuttle stops. Many of the activities the concierge recommends provide free or very discounted transportation as well/they know what companies provide transport from the Kahala. Totally worth it and glad we stayed here and not Waikiki. Close enough to access everything but far enough away to not be in the middle of craziness and feel more like you’re in Hawaii.

They couldn’t have made us feel more welcomed/ appreciated. The rooms here are dated - do not let the pictures on the website fool you. From the tile on the balconies to the carpets to the chipping on all the furniture - you can tell this place needs a renovation. The hotel has the most bizarre design you could imagine, with the parking garage being between the rooms and the beach. This results in “ocean view” rooms with having yes, an ocean view, but they also have fantastic views of the parking garage between them and the ocean. Maybe the rooms in higher categories don’t have this ridiculous view obstruction???The garage really takes away from your view. Another point - I never brought this up with the valet or hotel because I just knew they wouldn’t stand behind it, but I noticed scratches on my rental car that I don’t recall being there before I dropped it off. I’d also like to point out that there are several dolphins staying in a tiny (tiny for the size of these dolphins) pool within this hotel. I’m sure the hotel justifies it by saying this is actually good for the dolphins but just use your common sense - they’re charging $300 per person for you to get in that water and play with the dolphins - so whatever the hotel claims about the well-being of the dolphins, just know that they’re only here as a money maker for the hotel. The hotel has a wall of VERY famous people that have stayed here and I know that those people would NEVER have stayed in the room that I was put in, so I imagine their suites are nothing like the basic rooms they have.

James Kepa, The Front Office Manager, did an exceptional job providing my airport transportation, and getting me checked in quickly when we arrived at the hotel, and personally escorted me to my room. He was efficient, friendly, and offered to help me in any way to make my stay pleasant. He was very flexible to work around my meeting schedule in arranging my transportation details. As always, Kathy Morse, The Executive Assistant to Gerald Glennon, the General Manager, took care of all of the details of my reservations perfectly. My Hertz rental car was conveniently ready for me just outside the lobby in the circular drive, thanks to Dallas, their agent, and the parking attendants loaded whatever I needed for my meetings in the trunk before I picked up the car. The concierge staff was always offering to help, whether it was to provide directions, copy documents for me, or print my boarding pass. Also, the staff always addressed me by name, which I found incredible and exceptional. The hotel management and staff take a lot of pride in the hotel, and make sure that their guests experience its warmth and elegance. Mr. Glennon is an exceptional role model for the staff, resulting in the utmost respect for the guests, and every attempt is made to ensure that they have the best possible stay at The Kahala. He is well-regarded by everyone, and that positive attitude permeates everyone who works there. For families with children, the opportunity to spend time with the dolphins is very exciting. The pool and beach activities are convenient for the guests, and the staff seems to be on top of everyone's needs. The restaurant food is well-prepared and offers a large variety for guests to make their choices. The calm ambience in the main reception area where guests can comfortably sit and visit in this very elegant but friendly environment is very special. The hotel is just a few minute drive from the bustling Waikiki area, but it feels like you are on an outer island where it is quiet and removed from all congestion.After staying there these past few years, I have experienced a consistency that few hotels have on a continuous basis.

The main reason we would not return is the quality of the beach - the swimming area is hemmed in by a big rock/reef area, and is quite shallow, although this seems to vary a bit by day. Also, the architecture of the hotel is very uninteresting - the lobby seems dated and the building itself is not very nice to look at. For the money we paid at the Kahala, we have stayed in much more impressive resorts in other areas.However, there are lots of pros as well. I think some families might prefer this hotel because of the dolphin program - I know my kids in their younger years would have liked this. Also, the resort is in a quiet area but is still very accessible to downtown, and there is a free shuttle to take you back and forth. This is nice, because sometimes you end up feeling trapped at your resort. You can stay here and have access to Honolulu when you want to get out. The restaurants are very expensive.

It is one thing for a hotel to accommodate requests. What the staff does at the Kahala takes it to the next level. They proactively anticipate guests’ needs and preferences. The attention to detail is stunning. The location of the hotel strikes the perfect balance between being close to attractions but being removed from the noise and chaos of Waikiki Beach. You are only a short shuttle trip to central Honolulu but the hotel feels like it could be on a secluded island. The grounds and facilities are kept up immaculately and seem out of a storybook. The pictures don’t do it justice. The beach is quiet and secluded with soft sand that is groomed daily and very gentle waves. The waves break about 200 yards off shore so you are still serenaded with ocean sounds but the water around the beach is very gentle. The lobby and public areas capture vintage Hawaiian style with modern, clean elegance. The lagoon in the center of the complex is full of wildlife and there is always a turtle or dolphin nearby. The rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious. I can’t say enough about the bathrooms. They are by far the nicest standard bathrooms I have ever enjoyed. They would be nice for a penthouse suite. The bathroom had two separate vanity and sink areas across from each other with separate shower and tub areas. Each side of the bathroom also has spacious closet and changing areas. The hotel offers a variety of food options and each one we tried was delicious. We ate at the Veranda, the Beachside Grill, and the Plumeria. We could tell that the food was expertly prepared with fresh, high quality ingredients. What really makes the Kahala stand out are the people. Every employee we saw went out of their way to make our vacation special. The shuttle driver Gary turned every shuttle trip into a tour, pointing out interesting sites and explaining local culture along the way. Ms. Koki, the chief concierge, and Mr. Ibarra, the hotel manager were personally engaged in our service and making sure every detail exceeded expectations. I could not recommend this hotel highly enough.","Canton, Michigan","jwitherell2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canton, Michigan</strong>",7,5.0

It offers pampering amenities, not to mention its first class hospitality and service. The Dolphins and various sea life on the property were an amazing added extra. Although already well known for its past distinguished guests, the Kahala still makes the impression of being a hidden gem, away from the maddening crowds of Waikiki. My daughter loved every minute we spent on the beach, offering the most serene and tranquil experience. Exactly what we were looking for in our family vacation! Lunch, just a few steps away from the beach at the Plumeria Beach House was exceptional with breathtaking views of the layered blue waters of the ocean.

The breakfast buffet was really impressive and enjoyable and we spent some time at the outside bar while hanging on the hotel beach. They make a good drink and the food was solid. They letIs try a bunch of beers while we enjoyed edamame. The room was large and clean and reminded us of staying at the Breakers in Palm Beach. The room had a Japanese toilette (Toto Washlet) which was awesome. We have them at home. The staff was very accommodating.

The biggest selling point for us was the long beautiful beach, even though it was obvious that the hotel was old. We were prepared to forgo less than stellar hotel. But unfortunately our stay was overall a disappointment.First and foremost, the Beach turned out to be a huge disappointment. The ocean is pretty shallow, about 5 feet deep at the deepest point (near the floating platform). The water seemed to be noticeably dirtier and colder than at Kona, Big Island of Hawaii (which we visited right after we'd left Kahala). The beach extends for about a mile towards the Diamond Head crater, but as soon as you leave the hotel area, it becomes much dirtier. A lot of broken glass, - so beware if you decide to go for a walk on the beach.Since the ocean wasn't very attractive for swimming, you're left with an old, small and boring pool, which as you can imagine gets pretty busy. The food at the pool bar is OK, but definitely not a 5 star.The hotel itself (lobby, rooms) is very old, and you can see the signs of tear and wear, but I guess, they sell it as an ""old charm'. The good thing about the rooms, is that they are clean and spacious. But the TV sets, for example, are 3 times smaller than those in Four Seasons The Italian restaurant in the hotel - Arancino is quite mediocre.The really good restaurant on the premises is Hoku's. Both the service and the food is very good.The Dolphin Lagoon (where you could have a swim with the dolphins) is a nice attraction, but is not enough to justify staying at the hotel.Overall, Honolulu in my opinion, is not a good vacation spot if you're looking for a beach vacation with the family.

There was one night in mid April where the manager informed the guests that the air conditioner would not be working from 10:30pm through 5:30am and lets just say my husband was not too happy about it. He made a point to tell the manager he was not happy and the manager made it right! He gave us a hotel credit for the inconvenience and had chocolate covered macademia nuts delivered to our room.

Years ago they had regular shuttle service to take guests into Waikiki, 20 minutes away. Now the service is spotty at best. The hotel is isolated and very remote, bored me to hang out there, took Uber to Waikiki each day. The resort has a deserted beach, small pool area, but more wind than other side of Diamond Head. Waikiki had better and warmer weather each day I was there. My memories of the Kahala 14 years ago were nice. I reminisced about the quality and warm reception you used to get. Not anymore!We had our choice of some premium rooms - 2 Dolphin Lagoon rooms and one beachfront room for additional $$$$. The beachfront room was awful, decor looked disheveled, markings on baseboards, furniture layout terrible - pass. The Dolphin lagoon room upstairs had a small balcony overlooking the lagoon. We selected the best of the 3, downstairs at the end of the lagoon with a small patio. Furniture was slightly better condition, but room was run down. Tiles in the bathroom floor had chips missing, scuff markings along walls and hallways, our carpet was old and musty. Wish I could have photographed but it would have upset my friend. The dolphins in the lagoon swim very close to the rooms. They flap their fins and clap their jaws which makes a noise that wakes you at night if the slider door is open.The pool bar was an utter joke! Unpleasant atmosphere, and charged the same price as beachfront Waikiki bars that make an excellent, fresh Mai Tai. I was disgusted when I tasted my Mai Tai, then saw that it was made from mixes - plus its served in a plastic dixie cup. The Hoku's restaurant was overpriced, stuffy atmosphere. Lobby outside of Hoku's had nightly piano music tho. The best restaurant was the Italian restaurant on site. Bummer that it's situated along the parking lot in front. Morning buffet was good, eating by the lawn area pleasant, service was slow.The small pool area always had a few kids in floaties in the pool, a few adults in the jacuzzi. The furniture and cushions were faded and worn, needed replacing. The hallways of the Kahala were dirty with skid marks on the walls and baseboards, the rooms were in run down condition. Not much attention seemed to be paid to comforts and nicer amenities for their guests. I'd never return to this resort! The only people staying here seem to do so to play on the golf course or want total isolation and privacy. The Kahala has had its day, go elsewhere if you want better treatment, updated rooms and nicer weather.","San Jose, California","Lili B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",36,3.0

Every single staff we encountered went above and beyond to make us feel very special. I was a little concerned about the whole idea of dolphins in captivity before we arrived as some comments have mentioned but after I saw how well they were taken care of and after speaking with some of the marine biologists at the facility I realized these creatures were right where they needed to be. And watching them play when noone was really watching or asking them to perform was a highlight of our trip. My only less than perfect score would be for the fancy Hoku's restaurant... overrated and not worth the price, but all of the other options were amazing. It was frustrating to have a lot of kids in the hot tub without their parents supervising (especially when there is a kiddie pool right there) but one of the staff said they were considering making the hot tub ""adults only"" which would solve that problem.

I like drinking Tea with lemon and honey.

The hotel is over 50 years old, so it wasn't gleaming new but any moments hesitation over the facade disappeared the moment we got inside what is a truly impressive hotel. Obviously we are not alone in our appraisal - we encountered multiple A-list celebrities during our stay and it was readily apparent why they would choose to stay there.",,dannybmn,1,5.0

The first part of my trip was business related so I stayed at a Marriott property in Waikiki, which I enjoyed. Two totally different hotels! Full disclosure, paying $900 a night for a hotel room was a big splurge for me so my expectations at the Kahala may have been skewed.The service here is wonderful! From the sweet valets to the front desk staff to housekeeping and the waitstaff, all of the staff I encountered were so kind, professional and did whatever they could to make you feel at home.The room was truly gorgeous - the furnishings and the decor were lovely. The bathroom was very nice! My only disappointment was being on the 2nd floor. For an ocean front lanai (again, $900 a night) I don't want to look out at the rooftop of the restaurant/lobby area. Those areas are open air so you could look right into the lobby from my balcony. If you only looked straight ahead or to the east, the view was much better. Since this was a big treat for me, I was disappointed a higher floor room was not available. I spent afternoons relaxing on their wonderful beach, swimming the in pacific and enjoying drinks while watching the sunrise. You cannot beat this beach. Compared to Waikiki it is a totally different experience. I enjoyed Waikiki, but this place is so quiet and tranquil. I only went into the pool once. Surprisingly, the water was super cold. Not many people were using it while I was there, but with this great beach why would you.There's not much around the resort if you want to get out and walk.

I swam in the beautiful waters and I showered in the luxurious room bathroom which was only 1 minute from the waters edge. The staff are friendly and polite. At first I thought the dolphin pool was cruel and then I did some research rather than making some false assumptions. Turns out that breed of dolphin would typically live in a lagoon that size in the wild. The dolphins seemed very well looked after and recieved only the very best care. Of course I would prefer to see them in the wild but this set up also allows for important studies and research. My only criticism of the hotel would be the pool side and beach service. The staff talk to themselves and have their backs to the guests on most occasions. I sat on the beach loungers for 5 days and not once was I asked if I could be helped or if I needed anything. Very strange and poor service and so easily rectified with some good training. One morning I couldn’t find any staff so walked into the kitchen of the pool side bar to find the staff grouped together talking and resting. Not the best when you have a beach full of guests.

The room rates for this time of year (early January) are astronomical and around 800 for a mediocre room. We booked a room block (10) for our wedding and had a contract locked in for a cheaper room rate. Despite having a contract, there was a dispute with the front desk and my parents - they tried to charge us full rack rate. After an argument and finally getting through to one of the managers they finally agreed to our original contract rate, which they should've done in the first place. Our room was decent but definitely not worth the price - the bathroom floor was damaged, looked dirty and did not feel like a 5-star hotel room like along the lines of the Mandarin or Four Seasons. The bed was ok but not great and luxurious like I was expecting. In addition, there was an incessant noise coming from the landscaping building, waking us up at 6:30 am on multiple occasions. I finally called down to the front desk and the desk clerk knew exactly what I was talking about but nothing was really done about it. His first solution was move us rooms, but it was 6:30 in the morning and that was a terrible idea as we were leaving that day. His second solution was to credit us with $100 off our stay, which was not much relative to how much we spent there for 3 nights.Our wedding however, was done well and was handled excellently by Kristal, the vendors that they have were good and that part of the experience was wonderful.One of the best parts of this hotel was the Sunday brunch at Hoku, an excellent array of fresh sashimi and tons of other great breakfast/brunch options for roughly $80/per person. Arancino was also a great option with some very good Italian food.Unfortunately I would not recommend anyone to stay at this hotel for the price you pay, but I would recommend coming for Sunday brunch or dinner at Arancino.

The one about the dismal lunch we had on the patio at the Plumeria Restaurant garnered a come-back from the manager that pretty much let me know that I was not being fair. Yes, I was. And did he offer me any kind of free cocktail or even a 10% discount to come back in for another experience? No. I also wondered if he/she noticed in other reviews of that restaurant that the breakfast critiques were great and the luncheon ones were pretty bad. Hello.My sister and our BFF decided to go to the Lanai at Kahala for High Tea. You can see the dolphins from there, and the pool area and ocean view. Those things are great. However, the service was not great. We had to track down the waitress to get some more Creme Fraiche for our scones and she disappeared after the tiered presentation as if she said to herself, 'Okay, done.' I'm going to keep this as short and general as I can because this was just not a satisfying experience. First of all, we each ordered the $35 dollar menu, which gives you choices of the kinds of sandwiches you wish to taste. Don't get me wrong, but I do know that High Tea is meant to be a snack and not a huge amount of food, but this was ridiculous. The three-tiered presentation was set on the table along with beautiful tea pots and other lovely china for tea cups and personal plates. Really beautiful if it weren't for the pathetic and meager offerings of 3 tiny sandwiches (one for each of us) and 3 miniscule toast points (one for each of us) with salmon laid on them like they were the most precious delicacy in the world. These were each the size of a domino tile. Then there was a scone on the top tier (one for each of us) and some pineapple preserves that were very good. That was it. It came off incredibly skimpy, not that amazing as far as taste, and left us wondering if there was another tier coming. Not. Oh, there were some sweets at the bottom that were pretty and also tiny. There was a total of about $6.50 in ingredients and our bill was over a hundred dollars. There were three of us at $35 each so the math is not that hard. The bottom line is that I feel the food was pretentious and just not worth it. I feel ripped off.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Sally J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",51,2.0

We opted for a room on the ground floor in an older part of the hotel. Our room had a sliding glass door and our own lounge chairs and was maybe 50 yards to the waters edge. This made all the difference as we had the ability to go in and out of the room. The hotel was great. Traveling over New Years holiday of course everything was crowded and it was difficult to make reservations for dinner and for spa etc. All this can be avoided with advanced planning and making reservations before you arrive. There were some great runs and walks from the hotel front door. Additionally, there was a free shuttle into town that seats about 14 I think so reservations were necessary but free ride. You can also Uber or cab into Waikiki for maybe 25-30 dollars. I don't think you need a car. We had a rental and used it to go to Whole Foods which was maybe 2 miles away and we were able to buy some snacks and wine for the room (good idea with three teenagers that are always eating). We also used our car to do an island tour. I would suggest that you download the app ""Shaka"" which will give you an island tour. We did the circle tour and it was awesome for $6.99 for app purchase. This way you can go at you own pace and stop at only those places that are of interest to you. The negative...as stated in other reviews we felt that at times they did not have the staff to accommodate the crowds. One day they did not have towels for us until 2-3pm as they said they ran out of towels. Also, sometimes during breakfast service we did not see our server much. It is a breakfast buffet everyday that is great but sometimes we needed certain things that only the server could get. Hotel property is great and you can walk for about one mile down the beach coast. Staff was awesome. I had a message at the spa and would highly recommend Reina (not sure if spelling is correct). My family loved our week here and I would definitely go back despite some of the staffing issues which I attribute to the holiday crowds.","Henderson, Nevada","TravelTroyBoy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Henderson, Nevada</strong>",11,5.0

It just seems like the hotel was unprepared for the Christmas/holiday rush...they ran out of towels multiple times! It seems strange for a five star hotel to keep running out of pool towels. There were very many nice employees who were clearly trying to do their best but there seems to be something wrong with their management or ownership.

I was worried about the resort being at capacity, especially over the Christmas holiday but it never felt like a zoo to us. Sure there were plenty of families with young children. We were traveling with our 20 and 17 yr old so we know what it's like to raise kids and we were happy to see everyone having fun. It was the week of Christmas so of course everyone young and old were excited!. We had reservations for our meals so we never had to wait too long to be seated even thought they were VERY busy.

The pool staff is a mixed bag...several gentleman are helpful and polite, while others are incredibly rude and disrespectful. Just so disappointing. The staff does NOTHING to prevent certain guests and their children from behaving terribly...there are no standards anymore. Kids and young teenagers shooting poolside guests with water guns (I watched two women with babies get shot with water guns while sitting in their chairs NEAR the pool).Pool staff ignored this. I say this as someone who was there WITH young children, who DID behave. One child defecated in the pool and instead of insisting the child wear a swim diaper (the girl was probably 3 years old), she was allowed back in...without her parents even watching her. Definitely not what a five star hotel should be...and not what it was for YEARS.

This is our sixth or seventh stay at the resort over the past dozen or so years. It is always a challenge to find anything approximating a true Hawaiian experience on Oahu, given how over developed and crowded Waikiki has become. We always found the Kahala to be an oasis of calm, located on a private beach in the Kahala neighborhood on the other side of Diamond Head from the chaos of Waikiki.But this last experience with a five-night stay in late December was so far below acceptable that I had to write about it. My wife and I had looked forward to our stay but by the end could not wait to leave. Check in process was fine – although the room was not available when we arrived at around 2pm, while waiting down by the pool area they upgraded us to one of their Beach Front Lanai rooms, which is their top room category, literally located directly on the beach. There are several problems with these particular rooms. The first is the overall disrepair of the rooms. The bathroom cabinets are decomposing badly and are seriously in need of being replaced. The carpeting is soiled and makes you uncomfortable to walk barefoot, which is totally unacceptable. But the worst aspect are the unpleasant smells. The hallway smells foul, even though it is open to the beach at the end. It must be an odor that has permeated the carpets and can’t be addressed with just vacuuming and shampooing. The rooms themselves smell appreciably better, but the toilet area is horrendous. It is not far from the odor you experience from a porta-potty. Also, the configuration is very weird in that it appears they attempted to upgrade the commode area several years back with high end Toto fixtures (incorporating air freshening, water cleansing, etc.) but the seats and bowls are too long for the small space for the commodes. So functionally the space does not work well. The rest of the experience was generally acceptable, but still not a five star experience. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating and cannot be faulted for the hotel and management shortcomings. The breakfast experience is marginally pleasant, provided you arrive early. The Plumeria Beach House is in an unbeatable location and seeing the sunrise over Maui and Molokai is a great way to start the day. If you are a fan of enormous choice, it is hard to beat. It is a massive buffet – like what you find in too many of the oversized hotels. But it gets overwhelmed with young children running from station to station examining their choices. An à la carte offering probably makes more sense. But I guess the hotel has to make choices and it appears that people like more choice. Our recommendation is to try and get their early and beat the crowds so you can get a table near the front of the lanai and have a less hectic breakfast.Most importantly, we remain uncomfortable with the dolphins in captivity. It certainly is a huge attraction of the hotel, but it is so bizarre and cruel to the animals. The island of Maui made these types of venues illegal, for good reason. The animals did not volunteer to give up their freedom to perform for dead fish. There is no reason for the Kahala Resort to continue this activity. Overall, the hotel looks quite dated and possibly they are in lease negotiations with the ground lease owner which is holding up the vastly needed renovations. In any event, I would steer clear of the Kahala Resort for the time being. Who knows if they will ever recognize how inappropriate it is for them to continue holding dolphins in captivity? We ended up heading across island to the relatively new Four Seasons at Ko’Olina, which was a vastly superior experience. It is sad to see this legend fall so far behind.","Palo Alto, California","kentfield</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palo Alto, California</strong>",41,3.0

From the reviews it looked like the Waikiki hotels were really busy with queues for check-in and breakfast - as we prefer it a bit more relaxed and the Kahala being 20 minutes outside of Waikiki it seemed like the best choice.We got a great deal on a Dolphin Lanai room with the Kahala’s “4th Night Free and Breakfast Included” package. Staying 9 nights meant we only paid for 7 nights and with breakfast for two being worth $98 a day that’s a really substantial saving.The hotel and resort are hard to fault - the staff are great, the grounds superb and there are multiple dining options from the poolside bar/restaurant at one end to Hoku’s fine dining restaurant at the other.It’s not cheap but when you discover just how expensive Hawaii itself is you come to realise that for the standard of the hotel it’s terrific value for money","Oxford, England","Relax802937</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, England</strong>",14,5.0

I found the setting lovely--especially the view toward the beach and south--and the service gracious and thorough. We were happy to be away from the urban intensity of Waikiki (you're in an upscale suburb) and felt a little like we'd gone back in time to a sophisticated resort of 20 years ago --in decor, style and service. Guests dress nicely, have tea or drinks in the lobby sitting area or read books on the porch overlooking the beach or listen to live music in the lobby bar. We liked the timeless atmosphere--the rooms weren't the latest decor, but they were large, airy and well-tended (big, double bathrooms). Very comfortable.The beach is nice, for all ages. No big waves in the bay and a raft for kids to swim to. Lovely views. Not a good destination for snorkeling, though. It could use a few more shade options (the lounges in the shade were taken early). Staff is very attentive and moved lounges to a shady spot for me.The spa and workout rooms are also first-rate. And it was really fun to see the dolphins work out with their trainers, who seem to keep them stimulated.My only complaints were relatively minor--I was disturbed by the terrible, bright lights atop the garage between the driveway and the beach. If you like to leave your window open at night (if we have a beach view, we want to wake up seeing it), the glow of those lights was awful. And there was noise at night from the front driveway below. You have to close your window and blackout curtains. The hotel graciously moved us to the other tower facing overlooking the dolphin pool (for an upcharge), which was much better. But what architect was allowed to build a beachfront garage (waste of prime real estate) with such terrible, bright lights on the roof? It mars the views and peacefulness of the place.I'd also like to see more healthy options on the menu, especially for breakfast at the Plumeria. How about one egg with greens (rather than a 3-egg omelet as the healthiest egg option?). The buffet is full of options but overkill for every day (and pricey). I was able to order a la carte, but was bored by the menu there and at the pool bar. Also, there were almost no vegetarian options. A little spa food would be nice. The more upscale Japanese-themed restaurant upstairs was very good, however, but not a breakfast option.Overall, though, a timeless hotel in a lovely spot away from the urban experience of Waikiki.",,Evoscribe,3,4.0

We purchased our all-inclusive vacation (flights, rental car, hotel, and breakfast buffet for 2) through Costco Travel, and we will do it again. The service was amazing, and the amenities are top-notch. We stayed in the dolphin lagoon, which I thought my kids would go crazy over, but they were so taken with the ocean and the beach that they didn't really pay attention to the dolphins. The beach is absolutely stunning and the beach-side pool, baby pool, and hot tub were perfect for my kids. The only downside I can think of is that it is a little off the beaten path (meaning it's not like Waikiki), but if you prefer your resorts to be quiet and relaxing and don't mind driving to get to dinner and do some shopping, then this is the best place for you. While we were on the resort, we had a photo session with Pacific Dream Photography; I made the reservation a few days before we arrived, and the session itself is free (it was about 45 minutes long). The day of the shoot was windy and we had a cranky toddler (who had not napped) but our photographer was friendly, professional, and patient! She also took lots of ""action"" shots of the kids, which I think is the best way to capture small ones. I went in with zero expectations but came away pleasantly surprised -- we wound up purchasing the photographs because they were so nice. I highly recommend you try to the session out -- there's no obligation to purchase if you hate everything.",,Famfamtravtrav4,0,5.0

The rooms are spacious and beautifully appointed: wonderfully comfortable beds and linens. Everything in the room is first class.. The lanai overlooking the ocean is private and so very quiet here away from the throngs of tourists at Waikiki. I picked this place because I am a huge fan of the original Hawaii 50 and it’s star Jack Lord who lived in the Kahala area. This caused me to read on about this area and this Hotel . We are thrilled to be here and not looking forward to leaving at all. Dolphins playing in the ocean, 80 degreeF weather, and the friendliest people I have ever met , both at the hotel and the locals while walking around the area. Only thing I might do differently next time is a room with full ocean view rather than part ocean view, part parking lot view but no big deal. There is really nothing not to like here.

The positive attitude of the staff and the beautiful grounds were impressive. Our room was spacious and comfortable! The balcony was large, extra wide and deep, with comfortable chairs & table. The large bathroom had a separate tub & shower. It included a high end, full service toilet! On a separate note, I was impressed with management. I had a small issue & the quick & proper response was impressive. This hotel’s priority is to manage a top notch hotel with superior “top notch” service. Every department is obviously properly staffed. The breakfast buffet provides a wide assortment of food for various appetites. The food was always delicious and fresh. The location and views from the restaurant were impressive. The lounge area had a very talented pianist/singer. The drinks were tasty & properly mixed. Would have been nice if they had a “Happy Hour”, which we grew accustomed to, in Maui. The location of this property is perfect! Tucked in a residential area, away from the zoo of Waikiki! It is quiet & serene. Bordered by the beach and a beautiful, private golf course. Never had an issue with availability of beach loungers, which they will set up for you, on sand or the grass area.

The people were friendly, helpful and very customer service focused. The Kahala resort is an upscale resort that makes a person feel relaxed and welcome from the moment you enter the property. The views are amazing and the ability to relax and absorb the true Hawaiian spirit is phenomenal. We ate at 3 of the restaurants on site and each was excellent with great service. The Plumeria is a perfect location for breakfast, lunch and/or dinner. My only negative comment is the number of birds that tend to gather around the tables at times tends to be a nuisance and could be unsanitary. The pool bar was a nice place for lunch as well. We also ate at the Italian restaurant on site and it is a true seafood Italian menu. The portions are small yet delicious. The rooms are luxurious and very comfortable. There were 2 sinks and closets in the room we had and had a very nice view of the ocean. The beds were extremely comfortable. I highly recommend this resort.The event room was set up perfectly and the temperature was just right. We had lunch catered by the resort on 2 days and it was very delicious. The menu was varied and the food was very good. Overall this is an excellent resort and I would highly recommend. It is close to Diamond Head and away from the business of Waikiki which is perfect.

As I drove up the tree-lined driveway, a spectacular border of vibrant red pointsetias tastefully reminded me that the festive season is upon us. As my car came to a halt, the warmth of the welcome and the personal recognition of being a valued return vistor set the tone for my stay. The Kahala is a very special place - a touch of the country with a beautiful horseshoe shaped bay, just 10 minutes from the bustle of Waikiki. The huge lavishly decorated Christmas tree filled the air with scent of real pine and continued a tradition begun 40 years ago when this elegant resort was born from the marshy foreshore of east Kahala.The warm welcome continued at check-in, which took less than a minute since I was a returning guest, and adorned with my welcome lei I was escorted to the elevator and was soon in seventh heaven in my ocean-front corner suite. These suites must be the largest on Oahu - at least 500 square feet of easy elegance. Nothing brash or intimidating here, just the hallmarks of 5-star elegance without a hint of bling! The view was magnificent along the coast in both directions, across the golf course to the east and then down onto the bay and the unique dolphin pools which make this one of the most magical resorts anywhere.Everything is as you would expect, beautiful bed linen, soft yellow drapes, elegant furnishings, art, rugs and spacious old-world bathrooms (2) . Share, or have a bathroom all to yourself. But most of all it is about the people. This is a hotel where genuine, Hawaiian hospitality and luxury resort service are in everyone team member's DNA .....it comes from their heart and that makes ALL the difference.

The Kahala Resort holds a special place in our hearts, and every year on our return they treat us so well...like royalty!!! From the moment we arrive and pull up to the valet area, we are greeted by friendly staff that are eager to help us with our belongings. The front desk personnel are warm and welcoming...even the security staff greet you and smile at you!The Kahala is absolutely breathtaking. The lobby is absolutely stunning, and the views are simply magnificent from the lobby balcony, the rooms, and even on the shore! We’ve stayed in an ocean view room and the scenic view rooms, and both have spectacular views. We love both the ocean and mountain views we’ve had. I especially love the Kahala during Christmas, as it is so beautifully decorated. We love dining at the Plumeria Beach House for breakfast. The food is always so good. At night, since we have three kids, we opt to eat in the Veranda for some light pupus. Superb! You cannot go wrong with either places to eat. Next year, my husband wants to finally do a stay with just me and him. So maybe we’ll finally get to try the highly-touted Hoku’s and Arancino. I cannot wait!!!During two of our stays, we made an appointment with Pacific Dream Photography, located in the lower lobby, right at the bottom of their orchid staircase. I can’t tell you enough how happy I was the first time we took pictures with them in Dec 2015. The photographer we had then was so easy to work with. She took amazing shots of our family and even took some maternity shots of me. The photos turned out beyond my expectations!We just had our 2nd shoot with them, as we returned for our 7th anniversary. I wanted new photos for our family, and they are still as fantastic as I remembered them the first time...if not BETTER than the first time. Our photographer Maisie (or Macy...sorry...I’m not sure of the spelling) was so patient and so sweet. She really captured amazing photos of my family, and I have 3 young children. She kept right on shooting and really produced fantastic images!!!When the images were ready, I had to view and select the images I wanted to purchase. Jacob was so very patient with me, and there were so many amazing images from which to choose! He made the entire process so fun. I swear we both were laughing half the time. Jacob was really just awesome to work with, and I cannot day enough how I recommend Pacific Dream Photography. You won’t regret it!Staying at the Kahala is so relaxing! It’s far away from the hustle and bustle like other hotels in Waikiki but is still minutes from the city and malls.

I also want to do hats off review for Pacific Dream Photography, we did a sunset photo shoot with Jacob and Macy and these two crushed it. It's hard enough to get photos with 2 year and 5 year grumpy crazy boys... and these two succeed with flying colors.

We planned a very special 5 night trip with our children and grandchildren for Thanksgiving. Seeing them is something that happens very rarely so it was a big deal for us. I will start with what works and get to what doesn’t.First off, the Hotel itself is very nice. I would recommend the location very highly. For any of you concerned it is too isolated, I would advise that getting to Waikiki or shopping or Diamond Head is very convenient. We did go down to Waikiki and I have to say it was crowded and dirty. There was trash on the beach which was really a small strip with wall to wall people. The small beach strip is lined with hotels and entertainment and very noisy and active and so far from Hawaii that I’m not sure I understand the appeal.We had ages 1, 3 and 7 years, 20’s, 30’s, 50’s and 60’s. My main concern was whether it would work for all of use. It absolutely did. The beach is gorgeous, CLEAN, well maintained and even booked to capacity, it never felt crowded. Gentle warm waves and plenty of lounge chairs and towels. Activities for everyone to do. Perhaps not the best snorkeling but that is available a short distance away.The pool was a surprise. I was worried about there only being the one, but plenty of chairs, never too full and great for both children and adults. They sell floats, rafts, balls, including small floatie for 1 year old at very reasonable price which was a pleasant surprise. I bought a great variety which made more fun for all the ages! We simply left it behind for others to enjoy. Prices for floaties, tubes and raft was from $4 to $11,I arranged for double umbrella stroller, car seats, pick up with concierge effortlessly before the trip. Our daughter requested double baby jogger for the early morning time change so she could run. For that, I went through a private service BabyQuip Quality Partner Ashlee Westmoreland (808) 868-5040. She was incredible. She actually delivered the jogger late in the day so our daughter would have it for the first morning. She is really a special person.Our four rooms were beautiful and nice size in the tower. We arranged for a suite for our daughter and son in law that have the 1 and 3 year old. The suites are definitely well appointed and perfect for families with small children. We had a regular king ocean view and loved it. Very updated and in great condition. Toto toilets (bidets) are in all categories of tower rooms – not sure about the other rooms. The other two rooms were same quality and consistency.Important note - I am a super light sleeper. I was a little concerned about the location of our room - beautiful view but by laundry and cleaning station. Once the door was shut - you can't hear a thing. No noise from above, below, sides or outside. I slept so well there.Views are very personal but I would definitely specify what you want. One of the room was a partial and it overlooked the parking lot. I think this is a communication responsibility. We checked in early so we were able to move our rooms with ease within the category. The front desk staff was super accommodating.Spa was out of this World. Super nice surprise. Excellent therapist – facials and massage. Wendy was my massage therapist. I can’t say enough about how wonderful she was – her warmth, professionalism and skill level was superb. I wanted deep tissue but desperately needed some relaxation and received it – I felt like I was in a trance when it was over.FOOD – Vertanda Afternoon Tea is amazing. A local friend suggested it and met us for Tea. My daughter and her friend joined. It was wonderful. We sat on the patio and had delicious delicate sandwiches, smoked salmon, chicken, cucumber. The pastries were ridiculously incredible. Tiny versions of the best of the best. We had a glass of champagne, enjoyed the overhand and breeze and could see the pool and the little ones having fun with their parents and grandpa!Hoku’s – food is on a different level. Impressive and well prepared. Absolutely no complaints. IT is expensive and the service is slow, but the servers are so pleasant, knowledgeable and attentive. We were impressed. Cons –Housekeeping is not an automatic. It is very well done and rooms are really cleaned well and lot of nice touches. My comment is when you leave for a few hours or down at the pool, just call housekeeping or let one of them know if they are outside the rooms that you would like your room done. We came back from long day to messy room the first day, but this was taken care of after we became proactive.Seaside Grill – super slow, super stressed and food is downright bad except for the fries. Really nice hostess and servers. They obviously don’t get the support they need. I don’t have enough information to know why the food is so bad.PLUMERIA RESTAURANT is really the weak link here. The food is so-so and the service is abysmal. Breakfast brunch isn’t great. It’s not thought out carefully. One day fish special and other vegetarian or poultry option, rest of time literally entire hot area was nothing but pork. Pork bun special and then down the line, two types of pork sausages, bacon, ham. A distrubtion would have been nice. Omelet station often had only one person and was over burdened with very long line. Most people would give up. When they had two people it was comparable to other luxury hotels – a wait but doable so you’re not eating alone if the rest of your party isn’t waiting with you. Stations get messy and run out of items often – really often.Ala carte orders during brunch – won’t get there until you are almost done – doesn’t work well with an already over taxed system. We had a meal with all the family and sole purpose of this trip was for us to spend together as a family. We were seated at 6PM and ended getting appetizers and then waited over an 1.5 hourswith no service whatsoever. No water refills, no drink replenishment and our dirty plates left stacked on the table. Every once in awhile, our server would breeze by and say our meal was coming out shortly. Needless to say, the children got very antsy and after 1.5 hours and several complaints, we ended up leaving. We had no choice. The 1 and 3 year old was done for the night and it was their bedtime. Explanation – there were several functions and the kitchen was over burdened. Why they didn’t close the restaurant is very odd and makes zero sense. In other words, it wasn’t there fault! There was a wedding reception and another party going on in the Hotel. Our observation was there was receptions almost daily and we received terrible service as a rule. Why is this okay? There are few things I dislike more than excuses when paying for service. This is an expensive venue, so ignoring our tables for 1.5 hours down to no water, no drinks, no clean up of messy appetizer dishes is up there with Plumeria being the worse dining experience we’ve head. We had to ask that the dinner would be delivered upstairs to the rooms. So, our last dinner together wasn’t together but stressful, messy, upsetting and everyone was in their respective rooms instead of enjoying time together. Our son and daughter were struggling with little children that needed to have baths and get to bed. Needless to say, dinner was cold and inedible. Management – dining manager was apologetic, hotel manager apologetic but that was about it. Horrible last experience. Really made us sad and so disappointed. It’ll be two years before we are together for the Holidays. Can’t really make that right. Didn't hear a word from the Resort - nothing!","Atherton, California","Terrie K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atherton, California</strong>",33,3.0

But you are just a short drive away from all the great restaurants in Honolulu and the activities (Arizona memorial, Bishop Museum, Iolani palace, etc). We did scuba diving at a nearby dive shop (Reef Pirates). We had an ocean view lanai room, which was nice but I would recommend trying to get on a higher floor. We were on the 3rd floor and got some noise from the lobby due to room location. We still slept like a pair of rocks though! The bathrooms have heated toilet seats which is pretty much the pinnacle of pampering. The beach is nice with warm, calm waters. You can get snacks and drinks right at the seaside grille. It is also amazing to have the dolphins right there. We did not buy any of the experiences, but you can still stand and watch them swim around and do their activities with the trainer.

In past years I've gone to Kauai and the North Shore (Turtle Bay Resort) during convention visits, but this year decided not to rent a car and just chill closer to Waikiki. I've long known about the Kahala, but this was my first stay. Distance-wise, it's just a few miles east of Waikiki, but in terms of tranquility and solitude, it's light years away. The Kahala first opened in 1964 and was for many years a Hilton property. It was a Mandarin Oriental property for a shorter period, and is now Japanese owned. The hotel was designed by the Long Beach CA-based firm of Killingsworth, Brady and Smith, a highly regarded architectural firm known for their modernist mid-twentieth century structures. Edward Killingsworth is known for his post-and-beam construction, of which the Kahala is a shining iconic example. Nowhere on the property is the beauty of this type of design more noticeable than under the east tower where the hotel cantilevers over the open ground level space that houses the Dolphin Quest check-in area. The Killingsworth firm also designed Case Study House #25 in Long Beach CA. If you're interested, google the Case Study Houses-- they put mid-century residences in Los Angeles on the map, architecturally-speaking.The Kahala has a Walk of Fame nestled amidst its retail shops. Here photos and autographed notes from dignitaries and celebrities are found. Also, perhaps more importantly, are iconic black-and-white photographs taken by famed architectural photographer Julius Shulman in 1964. Shulman also famously photographed the Case Study Houses.The hotel's rooms are housed in the original 10-story main building and a 2-story triangular Dolphin wing. Half of the rooms/suites in the main tower have ocean views; the other rooms face inland (they're called ""scenic"" rooms). Every other room in the main tower has a lanai, the other rooms have a sliding door that fully opens, but no step-out lanai. The Dolphin wing rooms either face outwards towards the ocean or inland. Inward-facing rooms look onto the dolphin lagoons. I think all these rooms have lanais. The lobby is a soaring semi-open-air space that harkens back to the 1960's. There's a large lanai that looks over the pool. The Veranda restaurant is adjacent (afternoon tea, light meals, cocktails, evening music). The more formal Hoku's restaurant is a few step further. One level below is the Plumeria Beach House (buffet and a la carte breakfast, lunch and dinner) and the ballrooms. There's also a pool/beach cafe (Seaside Grill) and the Italian eatery Arancino. The area that connects the main tower with the Dolphin Wing houses the spa treatment rooms, which face a small semi-private relaxation patio. The fitness centre is adjacent to the Plumeria Beach House. There are unisex locker rooms, showers, hot tubs, saunas and steam rooms here. There is also a Hospitality Suite for guests to use before check-in or after check-out should the need arise. There's comfortable seating, some refreshments, even a shower.Check-in included a cool wet towel and a lei. My room was an Ocean View room in the west (Diamond Head) wing of the main tower which overlooked the lobby and motor court, with the ocean beyond. The Ocean Front rooms are in the east (Koko Head) wing of the main tower and overlook the pool with the ocean beyond. The room was pretty large and well-appointed. There was a ceiling fan, appropriately placed outlets, good (and quiet) A/C. The bathroom was split into 2 sides, each with a sink and closet, with a shower on one side and a tub on the other. In the middle was an enclosed Toto toilet--the Japanese kind with bidet features. There was an empty mini-fridge and coffee/tea machine, plus bottled water. Wifi was free. Note the Kahala does not have a resort fee! A true rarity these days. My time here was all about planning nothing and seeing where the day took me, if anywhere. Onsite, a main feature is Dolphin Quest experience, run by the same folks who do the experience at the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island. There are many packages to choose from, none of which are cheap. The pool is nice but small. There are ponds with fish and turtles, plus a Keiki pool and jacuzzi. There's a Keiki Club too. The beach here is pretty large and very calm both in and out of the water. The waves break far out in the distance. I think some beach chaises can be had for free. Others that are more cabana-like or have retractable awnings certainly have a fee. Some have an attached cooler. Chairside service is via a beeper. Worlds away from the chaos of Waikiki beach. Because the hotel is located in a residential area, doing activities off-site, including eating at non-hotel restaurants, requires transportation. The hotel has a great shuttle service that goes to the nearby Kahala Mall, Waikiki, the Ala Moana Shopping Centre, Bishop Museum and Iolani Palace. Although technically within walking distance, the roads to the Kahala Mall are heavily trafficked and do not have sidewalks. I took the shuttle there one afternoon and ended up having dinner at a decent ramen place. Had I known better, I would have made plans to eat at the Zippy's near the mall. I used Lyft for arrival and departure from the hotel. Taxis also always seemed to be waiting for fares. The Kaimuku area of Honolulu is nearby and has several eateries of note. I tried Koko Head Cafe for breakfast and used Lyft. I had 4 on-site dining experiences at the Kahala. I tried the famous Sunday Brunch at Hoku's (reviewed separately), the breakfast buffet at Plumeria's (reviewed separately), a pleasant lunch at the Seaside Grill and room-service club sandwich. Food quality ranged from very good to excellent. The atmosphere at Hoku's and Plumeria was a bit frenetic and thus service was not the most attentive. The Seaside Grill was also pretty busy but the waitress was quite good. Overall an excellent and relaxing stay in a classic, iconic hotel. My only regret was not eating at Zippy's.",Los Angeles CA,"pillowsofwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles CA</strong>",1202,5.0

The turndown service each night was a nice touch with chocolates and flowers placed on the bed. Everyone from front desk, to restaurants, to pool workers were over the top friendly and helpful.

At the same time, it is only a few minutes drive from the heart of Waikiki so one can still enjoy the metropolitan city with its many attractions.Its rooms are spacious and comfy with excellent room service. The only other place in recent past, where we had a true turn-down service every night was the Savoy in the UK. The pool is small, but the hotel is small as well, so unlike places like Aulani where you have rush at 6 AM to reserve your chair, here, you can casually walk to the pool by 8 or 9 and probably even later and still get yourself a chair with great poolside service.Most importantly and unlike many other hotels, we made a complaint to the poolside manager re the functions that had been booked after 2PM at pool side which limited some of our pool time. The team was very gracious and kind in making arrangements for our party of 9 to have dinner at the Arancino Italian restaurant, which was a culinary experience in itself. Last year, when one of the valets at the Waldorf in Maui nearly ran over my son, the manager did not even apologize let alone make a gesture.Jenny Groudine the poolside manager had also left a box of chocolates in our room, which for a day I thought it was something my wife had bought. I can go on and on about this hotel, but I think it'll all be captured in the fact that, after 6 or 7 trips to Hawaii, I think we have finally found OUR hotel.

One disappointing factor which caused some annoyance the day prior to our departure was that management made the decision to close the only pool from 2pm for a private function. Yes, the ocean is right there but given you are paying top dollar to stay at this resort, not having access to the pool for half a day is very disappointing. We were only advised of this via a letter delivered to our room the evening prior. I would suggest they would have known about this when we checked in four days prior and I wish we had been advised then - we could have planned around this. Given the resort only has one pool I felt the decision to do to close this to guests for half the day, for a private party, to be unbelievable.

Heritage. Private Beachfront Retreat. These are the words that embody the Kahala Hotel and Resort.One of the oldest landmark hotels in Oahu, the Kahala is ‘the’ place to stay if you wish to be away from the traffic and tourist traps that are Waikiki.20-25 minutes UBER (Uber or Lyft are allowed at HNL airport) or Taxi from the Airport, the Kahala is located right on the beach, adjacent to the Waimea private golf clubs and residences. And here is where one finds “Hawaii”. The noise of the ocean right on your balcony. Palm Trees. Quality restaurants. It is 15 minutes to Waikiki although the complementary shuttle takes 25 minutes.A complementary shuttle requires advanced reservation (preferably a day or two before - so plan ahead or call concierge in advance of arrival). Nearby is the Kahala Mall 1.1 miles away with a large whole food supermarket and light shopping. The next stop on the shuttle is Ala Moana which needs no introduction as the largest and busiest open air mall in the US. Following this, luxury row adjacent to the Ritz Carlton Residences near Waikiki main and then onto the stop next to DFS Galleria.The Kahala is owned by a Japanese consortium and is reflected by both staff, service and clientele. Rooms are dated, in keeping with the age of the hotel yet still clean and well appointed. We recommend being on the beachfront category which offers gorgeous views and the beach being a minute’s walk away. King sized bed was comfortable as were the feather pillows. Simple bath and shower. Brewed coffee, mini-fridge and the usual hotel room amenities. Power points are readily available. The beachfront rooms have a small “lanai” or balcony seating two chairs and a small table. The white sand beach calm, warm with the opportunity for paddle boarding although quality snorkeling is best found elsewhere.Being a busy, spread out hotel - room service, housekeeping and turndown can often be ‘late’ although a quick phone call rectifies things quickly. Breakfast at Plumeria is fine, with mostly continental and American breakfast buffet fare. If you book via various loyalty programs (e.g. Leading Hotels of the World, American Express FHR, Virtuoso) then it is complementary. Be aware there is a 5-10 minute wait time during peak hours after 8am. Hoku, it’s signature restaurant offers fresh Hawaiian seafood and although not quite “Michelin” quality was some of the freshest seafood we have had the pleasure of trying on three islands in Hawaii.Within the resort is the partner Dolphin Quest. Controversial for dolphins in captivity, many tourists were iPhone snapping away at the dolphins constantly during the day. They are literally swimming right there in the middle of the hotel. As is one green turtle and fish in the lagoon. Would we recommend the Kahala? Yes. It’s not Kapalua Bay on Maui but it’s probably one of the closest thing to a resort that one can find in the ‘miniature L.A” and hustle bustle that is Oahu.8/10",Australia,"DrKevy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",57,4.0

We stayed for a week in the Dolphin Lanai room. I absolutely loved it! The grounds were very well kept, housekeeping came to your room twice a day, there are three restaurants on site and one where you can have what you might consider high tea. We had no problem with service, our concierge I believe her name was Joy she was an absolute marvel as we were there during hurricane Lane. The food was delicious at the Plumeria and simply amazing at Hoku’s! There were different activities that you could take pardon, like the spa, of course the pool and the beach, dolphin quest in the photo sessions. The photo sessions I was very Interested in but the packages start at $400. I really believe that they could get more people to buy if the package was lower. There was also some surfboard lessons that you could take, and also a workout room as well. This particular resort was not in the middle of tourism so you got a lot of the beach and the privacy and you’re not too far from Wakiki to be able to get to the tourism. It was very close to Diamondhead, and the Ala Mona Mall which is amazing if you are a shopper.

Tour drivers raved about it so either I have been spoiled in the past by staying at Double Island, Pullman Darling Harbour, Sofitel Barcelona and Shandrani in Mauritius to name a few 5 star hotels or the opinions of most guests are riding on the fact that many celebrities have stayed here in the past and it’s location. We arrived very tired after a long flight from Perth in Western Australia Around 1.00pm and were advised that our room would not be ready until 3.00pm. When we did check in it was a very ordinary experience and as they were upgrading their computer system it was explained that everything would have to be paid as we go eg dinners, drinks purchases etc could not be charged to the room. I chose a package which included Breakfast and the food was at best 3 Star, it normally costs $38 USD per person so was very disappointing. Dinner was okay but nothing to rave about. If you want access to a mini bar there is a charge to stock otherwise the fridge is empty. The dolphins in the resort are kept in a small pool and are touched by humans constantly. I believe they are a money making attraction with no consideration for their welfare and would like to see them released back into the ocean. Room service was good even though we only had pizza it was tasty. The staff were polite but not friendly and some hospitality employees, especially on the verandah, took a while to serve drinks and had to be summoned after waiting 15 minutes on more than one occasion. On a positive note the rooms were spacious and well appointed with beautiful views and the hotel itself was elegant. No matter where we go we aim to make it a good experience but I felt like I should have shopped around more before deciding on this hotel. Trip Advisor had mostly excellent reviews however this honestly wasn’t my experience and I definitely would not put it in the value for money category.

The hotel is a short 15 minute drive from Waikiki Beach, and the location is simple to find, yet hidden from the hustle of Waikiki. The beachfront property has a dolphin lagoon, with 6 dolphins swimming right next to the walkways. If you book one of the Dolphin Lanais, you can sit on your balcony and watch them play, or leave your balcony open and hear them all night! Magical! The cove that surrounds the beach permits the waves to be much gentler than outside of the cove, and sets up an ideal swim area for not only children, but anyone in general! Every single member of the staff that I encountered, from valet and check-in, to the cabana attendants; from housekeeping, to every food service worker, including the three restaurant outlets I visited and room service were extremely courteous, professional, and overall, WELCOMING! Although everyone was spectacular, I was not able to get everyone's name that deserve extra special kudos-I would, however, like to point out how amazing Mariah and Sean at Seaside Grill were. Mariah spent an extra few seconds to tell me how pretty my hair looked and made sure that my daughter especially enjoyed her chocolate shake. When I ordered a light and refreshing Acai Bowl for lunch, Sean was able to relate so accurately by my meal choice that he knew I had the same for breakfast! Deedee from the Concierge desk swung by my cabana while I was out on the beach, and knew exactly who I was, and offered to assist with any concierge services, including dinner reservations, dolphin encounter, shuttle service, and shopping information-this is an amazing service that reminds your guests of plans that they might have overlooked, or put off (such as ensuring you have some where to eat tonight!). Mary Jane in Hoku's was SUPERB! Not only was she extremely attentive to myself and my adult dinner companion, but she was able to incorporate my 10-year old daughter into the meal as well. Too many times have I seen children (my own included) spoken to, especially in restaurants that are on the fancier side of the spectrum. Mary Jane, though, made my daughter feel welcomed, explained the menu to her, and gave fantastic recommendations. When asked about a specific ingredient on the dessert menu, she gave a a description that was so detailed, and yet, so enticing, that it sold my daughter on THAT dessert over any other! Such a great hotel, with an amazing staff!","Kaneohe, Hawaii","duckie808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",2,5.0

My dad grew upon Oahu so we discussed at length where we should stay. We were a bit conflicted about the dolphins in the lagoon but wanted to stay somewhere quiet on the south side of the island. The hotel itself is a little dated but is set in a jewel of a neighborhood with a nice sandy beach where my kids played and jumped off the floating barge every day.Upon arrival, we were presented with orchid leis and my kids enjoyed the dolphin cookies that were brought to our room as we waited for our luggage. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was the spaciousness of the rooms as compared with other hotels. Our bathroom was outfitted with a Toto washlet bidet seat, separate shower and bathtub, and two sinks. My parents were also staying in a separate room so the hotel placed us on the same floor, which was thoughtful and convenient.On the first day, we ate at the Seaside Grill which seemed a bit pricey for what we received. However, we also dined at the Plumeria Beach House for a breakfast and dinner and really appreciated both the food and watching the sun set as we dined on the lanai. We wanted to try out Arancino because a friend thought it was the best Italian she had eaten in sometime but weren't able to due to lack of planning on our part.The concierges were excellent. Leimomi was a lifesaver and arranged a dinner reservation for 12 people at the last minute! Dee Dee steered us to Gone Surfing for a surfing lesson for my 9 year old that helped him have an fantastic first time experience. Dean and Cameron arranged our time on the Holokino (based at the Kahala), as well as excursions to Bishop Museum and a docent-led tour of Iolani Palace (which we had always wanted to do).My husband and I went to the gym on an off-time and were helped by a friendly and helpful gentleman as we tried out various equipment. When we decided to hike Diamond Head one morning, the valet handed us bottles of water and some towels as we got into our vehicle, which came in handy. All of the valets and housekeeping staff whom we encountered were friendly and professional.The only hiccup that we had during our stay was a bad odor in our room. We first complained about it but then thought that it was in our imagination. I bought a fragrant candle to deal with it but then said that we really should have moved as it wasn't going away. Housekeeping said that they had shampooed the carpet before our stay so something had happened in our room. They tried an ozone machine and a second shampoo before offering to move us to a different room. By that time, we only had a day or so left so we didn't think it was worth it. The hotel comp'ed our parking and gave us a dessert tray to make amends. Even afterward, I received a call (because I had been open to receiving a call) and was told that I should call back directly to make reservations and that they would take care of us. My parents' room didn't have any problems, and they were truly happy that we stayed at the Kahala versus somewhere in Waikiki. Since this was probably the last time that my parents would return to Hawaii, I was happy that they were happy and thought that everyone who worked at the Kahala truly has the aloha spirit.

From our visit, the people visiting include couples, families, and a good smattering of Asian weddings (or at least beautiful photo shoots). This is not a late night party / dj / people rocking out until all hours kind of hotel. It is also not a place to come and be overly budget conscious. That being said, it is a lovely splurge. If you go, be sure to walk down the hall of photos on the first floor and do try the Sunday brunch. It is sort of an event, so make your reservation early to get the best time for you.

I'm not sure what changes they have made since our last visit in 2014 in terms of management, but we noticed an improvement over our last visit - which is saying a lot, because our last visit was fantastic!The staff, especially the food and beverage manager Joy, and the bartenders Anji and Greg were particularly attentive and friendly. After meeting my husband and I, Joy made a point to come and say hello throughout our stay and remembered our names, which is greatly appreciated and adds that extra touch of warmth and Aloha that we love about the Kahala. Yes, the pool is small, however, it's no secret from the pics, so it should not come as a surprise to any visitor. The beach is wonderful, with a great breakwater / reef to keep it nice and calm, so I prefer the ocean for swimming and relaxing anyhow. I mean, I can go to a water park anywhere - I come to Hawaii for the gorgeous ocean water and the Kahala's beach is uncrowded and calm. The pool chairs do fill up, but we never had an issue all week with finding chairs with an umbrella. The only ""issue"", if you can even call it that, with the pool area is that they have done away with the wristband system for getting towels and chairs. I understand that it is a bit of extra work for the pool staff, however, we did notice for the first time people who clearly were not guests using the pool. There were several days when we were at the pool and beach all day, and did notice people coming up from the beach and making their way furtively to the pool, and then avoiding the pool servers and paying their food/beverage tabs in cash. An improvement was noted in the quality and quantity of the food served at the pool - even the keiki portions were quite large. All in all, the Kahala remains our home away from home in the islands.

Excellent service, comfortable room and wonderful restaurant added to our enjoyment and much needed r&r. The lagoon with the beautiful dolphins soothed our soul and rested our spirit - their frolicking and performance brought smiles and delight to us as well as admiration for these smart and sweet mammals. The beach is very nice with calm waters for swimming and morning strolls. One down side: May is a month when clusters of jellyfish are in the water and that spoiled some of our swimming fun but it was not a big problem since this problem is transitory.The hotel itself saw a more exclusive and privileged era in the past and many photos of dignitaries and celebrities who visited it adorn the walls of this hotel. It is still a lovely place and location but some of the magic of its bygone prime is missing and replaced by sometimes noisy and plebeian tourists encroaching its halls and grounds.That is the reality of the tourism business - exclusivity is harder to find and costly to enjoy, even though it was by no means cheap to stay here as it is never cheap to vacation in Hawaii.

Our room was spacious and clean. Nice bed sheets. Friendly staff. The only issue is that restaurants, city shuttle and pool area are all so overcrowded. It felt as if the resort could barely cope with the number of people it was hosting. Even having made reservations every single time we went out for breakfast and dinner, we always had to wait 10-15 minutes for our table. Plumeria was particularly crowded for breakfast, with lines forming to reception and food areas inside being surrounded, which it didn't make a very relaxing experience. Same can be said for the pool area (the beach area less so, but it's still pretty small) - SO MANY PEOPLE for such a small pool and so few chairs! The resort could benefit from expanding on its pool and restaurant offerings to accommodate for its huge numbers of guests. TV in the room didn't have Netflix access which we came to expect in hotels nowadays. The spa for us was one highlight (we had a couple's romantic package which was a treat, albeit a pricey one, but so worth it. The ladies at the spa are AMAZING. This is in our top two couple's spa treatments ever, sharing the first spot with Polynesian Spa in Rotorua New Zealand!). Hoku was another highlight: chef's menu was spectacular.

We got a good discount on our reception just by attending the showcase and also got to try a few select hors d'oeuvres/drinks/cake selections while there. We both think it's a definite must ""to do"" if you are considering having your wedding here. We also set up a menu tasting day to try out several dishes among their wide variety of items available...and this pretty much blew us away because we've been to several recent weddings and never tasted anything this good at any of them...even the dishes that we marked ""average"" were still very good.Anna Hinkley was our event coordinator and we both want to say if you work with her, you will be in great hands. She is so organized and on top of things....and really goes out of her way to help with anything and answer any questions you have. E.G. - The day before the wedding I had a car packed full of flowers/buckets/supplies and had an issue bringing it all up to the Hotel because I had a broken thumb. Anna directed me to the loading dock of the hotel, brought down a cart, and helped me make multiple trips to bring in everything to where it needed to go…one of the many times she went above and beyond to help us. She is fast in responding to emails, and is very detailed oriented.On the wedding day, we saw Anna at the reception and she worked with our coordinators to make sure everything started fine. The rest of the Kahala staff that evening were amazing…our guests had nothing but amazing things to say about the character of all the staff working the wedding. Almost every single guest we talked to said our wedding was probably the best they’ve ever attended and that the food was the best food they’ve had at a wedding. The one thing that may drive people away from even looking at this venue for weddings may be the price, but they are in fact very comparable to other hotels in the area. We looked at the Halekulani, the Hyatt, Royal Hawaiian, Hawaii Prince, Turtle Bay, and the Hilton Hawaiian Village. Believe it or not, The Kahala ended up cheaper than all those hotels mentioned, and the quality of the venue, food, service, is unmatched.Overall, if we had to do it again we’d choose the Kahala without a doubt…and ask for Anna Hinkley as our event coordinator - she’s the best!!","Vienna, Virginia","Juice305</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Virginia</strong>",1,5.0

It was absolutely lovely in many ways. The resort is quiet, beautiful, relaxing which was exactly what we were hoping. We took an Uber over to Waikiki just to experience it but it felt like we were in the middle of an ant hill. We adored the dolphin lagoon and even though we didn't buy the encounter experience we still were mesmerized just watching them as well as the turtles and other fish. Most of our time was spent lounging and playing at the pool. We thought our young son might get tired of the simple pool but he couldn't get enough, favoring it over the beautiful beach area. Fine by us as we were enjoying drinks and food from Seaside Grill. We also took advantage of the complimentary bikes- rode over to Diamond Head to hike. There is also a complimentary photography session with Pacific Dream Photography. This is a must. Our photographer was delightful and we were able to sit down with Daniel the next day to review. He surprised us with a video which actually had me a bit teary eyed. We LOVE our photos.I highly recommend Kahala.

The Kahala hotel is in a secluded and quite location. We stayed in March 2018 after a few nights at the Trump Hotel as my family wanted to be in Waikiki for a few days. We were greeted with smiles upon arrival and were offered cold refreshment. The staffs took great care of our belongings. Had quite a long wait to check in but it was offset by the very quite beautiful lobby and view of the ponds. Finally got to our room and was a bit letdown by the size of the room. It was cramped and definitely show its age. We enjoyed the beautifully and well-maintained beach and various ponds throughout the resort. We made a habit of walking around the resort and the beach each day during our stay. Definitely one of a kind to be able to have ponds with swimming dolphins, giant sea turtles, and fishes. The semi-private/secluded beach was quite welcome by my toddler son. Very clean and clear water with literally no surf.

Better than great service at every level, including exemplary service and treatment from Hotel Mgr James Kepa, and beach service Mgr Tom O’Malley who treated us like royalty. Great beach, great food, great service, highly recommend.Long version:Honestly, I wasn’t very impressed when we arrived. Given that our favorite and regular vacation destination is Las Vegas, where everything is constantly being renovated or replaced with something brand new and shiny, the Kahala Hotel is an older hotel, reflecting the 1960’s/70s, and showing its age in some ways. We check in and everyone is super nice, using our names—Good Afternoon Mr. and Mrs. Tivis— which is always nice to hear, but we get to our 5th floor room and it’s not good.The room is large, like Vegas, with very nice furniture, desk, sitting area, beautiful bed with twin dressers on each side that double as bed-stands, Keurig, small refrigerator hidden inside a cabinet, French doors leading to a nice large bathroom with his and her vanities at each end, plenty of closet space, safe in closet, separate bath and shower, but the view!! Having booked this online myself I was sure I booked an ocean front room, not ocean view. After all, this is our 25th anniversary and we’ve spared no expense. We CAN see the ocean, over the rooftop of the lobby and restaurant, across the entrance drive to the hotel. And the roof’s not pretty. It’s a sun faded pale green, that needs re-painting and has several spots in desperate need of repair. I snap a pic and say “this is not going to work,” and we head back downstairs.James, one of the hotel managers, overheard my complaining as I showed the desk clerk the photo and immediately interceded. He was super nice and even though the reservation showed that I had indeed booked an ocean view room (which, of course, is possible. I have made mistakes before) he did not hesitate to upgrade us to an ocean front room with a spectacular view of the pool/dolphin lagoon and beach AT NO COST. He also said that nothing was noted on the reservation about it being our Silver Anniversary (uhmm, that would also be my fault). He congratulated us and asked if he could send up some champagne and an assortment of candied macadamia nuts, compliments of the Hotel!Now that’s what I call turning the situation around on a dime. This guy was fabulous, and very professional and courteous. We were sold.Once in our room, soaking in the view, drinking champagne and eating chocolate covered macadamia nuts and strawberries, I discovered the super-duper toilet!We have stayed in hotels with bidets, of course, but this was something like I’d never seen. The toilet was equipped with a Toto SW574 combination heated seat, self cleaning action and an expandable wand that came out on command of remote control that could serve as bidet for front or back. Look it up on YouTube. I mean this thing is awesome, I decided I had to get one when we went back home, until I discovered how much they cost, and EVERY toilet in the hotel was equipped with this device, even the public restrooms off the lobby! The Seaside Grill is excellent and provides upscale dinner seating right on the beach. All the outdoor furniture is high quality—all the pool/beach lounge chairs made of wood with thick comfy cushions. They put covers on them for you and bring you towels. They have two levels of Cabana rentals, with the high end being $165 per day (as opposed to $300 a day at the San Luis in Galveston). The beach, while by law technically not private, is secluded and feels private, with jettis at each end breaking the waves and preserving the beach. (It was very calm waters and perfect weather our entire stay). It’s all very clean and beautiful, with a variety of activities at our disposal, like stand up paddle boarding, going out on a catamaran, snorkeling, etc. The staff is all over the place taking care of your every want without crowding you or hovering over you. Everyone is super nice, conversational and very professional. Like in a nice restaurant, the outdoor manager, Tom, makes the rounds and personally talks with the guests and took time to visit with us on several occasions.There is a dolphin habitat with 4 dolphins you can see and watch all the time, and pay to swim with. There’s also a connecting pond with large sea turtles and beautiful bright colored fish. There are small bridge crossings which make it perfect for viewing and picture taking. The pool seemed heated and best of all is open 24/7, which is a giant plus for us as we are night owls. The whole area is great for star gazing. The golf course and all the plants, flowers and foliage are stunningly beautiful. And did I mention the CLEANEST AND NICEST outdoor poolside bathrooms in the world!!!!!I could go on and on about the restaurants, of which there are five, but suffice it to say they are all outstanding. Being our anniversary we splurged at Hokus, which was an incredible culinary experience. We discovered talking with our servers that most of the staff has worked there for decades, which says a lot.I began to take in the history of the Hotel, and the fine antique furnishings in the lobby, the beautiful chandeliers, the glass display cases with cultural relics of Hawaiian history encased inside. The very long hall of pictures celebrities, Presidents and politicians who’ve stayed there over the years. It’s really an historic place.There were a couple of little things that bugged me here and there, but to minute to mention. After all, you can’t please all of the people all of the time. But overall the experience was superior and upscale, with any shortcomings being far outweighed by the exemplary service by everyone we encountered.Five Stars!","College Station, Texas","Greg T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>College Station, Texas</strong>",2,5.0

The room itself was pretty outdated, but it is easy to overlook that when you have the views that we had. It is definitely ready for a remodel. For a beachfront room, it was pretty standard, not overly large, but it was sufficient. There is a nice breakfast bufffet each morning, which can get quite busy. Small gym, but enough equipment to make it suitable for a morning workout. Paddle board rentals right on the beach and it is excellent water for paddle boarding. That was our favorited past time each day. Dophins on the property in the dolphin pond, which I don't really agree with, because I think they need to be in the wild, but they were fun to watch.

That evening, we went to the pool, as we always did the previous nights, to relax and let our kids take a dip in the pool. However, the pool was full of kids of all ages, seems like one group of families since they all knew each other, and they were throwing each other in the pool running around and screaming and diving/flipping all around the pool. Our kids were afraid to go into the pool. There were few other guest that came to the pool and walked away. The employs around the pool seemed afraid as well and did nothing. I reported this to the front desk and they did not even know about it. The girl at the front desk said that they will have the Front Desk manager contact me but no contact as promised.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by very friendly porters and were shown into a very impressive Lounge area leading to the check-in desks. A short wait and a beautiful Lei presented whilst we wait made us feel very welcome. We arrived early around 11.30am so our room wasn't ready yet, but that was okay as they offered to look after our bags whilst we went for an early lunch until it was ready. We had given the front desk my mobile number and they said they would let us know when the room was ready, and sure enough a couple of hours later it was. We ventured up to find the room and the hotel was lovely, it had really wide corridors and felt sumptuous. I had already requested a high floor room and we had been given one on the 10th floor. It was only a standard room but upon entering the room, it was beautiful, lovely laid out, clean and very big and really nicely decorated. It was much bigger than I could imagine and this was only a standard room. I was extremely impressed, and as soon as you walked in, the view hit you through the big windows, absolutely breathtaking. It overlooked the beautiful mountains and golf course at the rear of the hotel, and low down I could see a lovely waterfall. There was even a small Birthday desert waiting as our Travel Agent had let them know it was my 50th. We decided to have a wander around the hotel and this is truly a beautiful hotel. To it's gorgeous lounge with amazing large chandeliers, beautifully decorated and extremely friendly staff. We ventured outside as I was so keen to see the dolphins in the lagoon of the hotel before anything else. I was not disappointed, WOW, these amazing and fantastic dolphins swimming around the lagoon, We stood for ages just admiring them. Where can you go and have four beautiful dolphins swimming in a lagoon of your hotel. Once we teared ourselves away we walked around a beautiful pool overlooking the ocean, the most fantastic views, we really were in Hawaii, a place I have wanted to visit since a child. Our night at this hotel was lovely and I was already looking forward to coming back for 3 nights at the end of my cruise. For this one night though, I had booked a meal in Hoku Restaurant as it was also my 50th Birthday I wanted a special meal. Before the meal we went to the Lounge, The Veranda for drinks, it was very busy and we saw a couple of tables free but they had reserved on them. We were greeted by the Hostess and she asked if we had booked, we hadn't we only wanted a couple of drinks pre dinner, we told her that, and she said not a problem and showed us to one of the reserved tables without question, whether that was as we were resident I don't know but nothing seemed any trouble. We went to Hoku for dinner, I will review this in another review, but memorable it wasn't. We finished dinner and went back to The Veranda for more drinks, it was now quiet, music playing from the piano and a cool breeze coming in through the large open doors, this was a lovely place to sit, talk and listen to the music. As I said we were coming back here after the cruise for 3 nights, and so far, I couldn't fault this hotel at all. We had spoken to Lynn on Reception when leaving the hotel for the cruise and had asked if she could get us the same room when we came back. She explained they were full but would see what she could do. Upon returning 7 nights later, there she was on the desk, she greeted us and explained she was able to get us the same room with the same spectacular views. For 3 nights we chilled out in this lovely hotel. We booked for our first full day a Cabana by the pool overlooking the Ocean. These Cabana's are $200 for the day so not cheap. For this you get a couple bottles of water, some sunscreen, and a electronic device for calling a waiter/waitress over for drinks or food. But we found out, everyone gets one of these around by the pool, so your not that special. Other than the view, we didn't feel these were worth the money, so day 2/3 we just got our own bed around by the pool. In the 3 days we spent here, we spent a lot of time watching the dolphins, and after speaking to the trainers here for them, who are happy to answer any question or worries you may have about these beautiful mammals, they assured me they were as happy as they believe they could be and if they didn't want to do something they wouldn't. They looked happy, they played together when no-one was in with them, but I still can't help feeling if the lagoon was big enough, I hope so as watching some dolphins swim along with our cruise ship, I can't help but wonder if that's where they should really be. Whilst here we ate in Hoku, Plumeria Beach, Arancino and in the Veranda Lounge, all of which I will review separate as each one deserves a separate review. Except the Veranda Lounge, we ate in there the night before leaving, a light bite meal, but lovely, beautiful food thoroughly enjoyed it, easily as much as the other restaurants. I love this hotel, and hope one day to return, but living in the UK, it is a long way. The hotel is beautifully appointed inside and out, with spectacular views extremely friendly staff who can't do enough for you and you are not to far from either Waikiki or downtown Honolulu both of which you can get to via a shuttle that runs from the hotel free of charge. I didn't want to leave this lovely hotel, or this beautiful Island of Hawaii, but all good things must come to an end. Hopefully one day I can return.","Hornchurch, United Kingdom","elmerlisa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hornchurch, United Kingdom</strong>",35,5.0

If you're looking to compare this property to other high end resorts like the Four Seasons, don't, it's nowhere near their level any more. I think the root cause is management, as no one seems to follow any sort of standard operating procedure here, and things are generally rough around the edges as a result. Examples: if you order the same dish from room service, you get something slightly different every day. Sometimes things aren't restocked when room service comes, sometimes they are. Kids club (which is $$$$) is glorified expensive babysitting - they watch movies for a good chunk of the day. You're better off going to care.com and bringing in your own babysitter. Things are generally not well taken care of - check out the banister across from the check-in desk- it's pretty beat up, and that's a symbol of what you should expect from the rest of the experience. Clearly there is some sort of staff issue since many of them have buttons saying ""One job should be enough"". The only reason to wear a button like that is because you're not happy with how you're being treated, and you want people to know. If you come here, go to the Italian restaurant - it seems to be somehow managed separately and the staff there is way better and food quality is way better. Drink prices were $12/drink vs $16 in the hotel. I've been coming here since I was a kid, but those days are over. This is now more of a ""value play"" since the room rates are slightly cheaper than other high end resorts, but you get what you pay for.","San Anselmo, California","cyclin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Anselmo, California</strong>",60,3.0

It remains our favourite hotel on Oahu. Location is fabulous, quiet but still within a 15 minute shuttle to downtown Waikiki. The private beach is wonderful and the atmosphere of the resort is relaxing. Rooms are spacious and although we were upgraded, our particular room was feeling a little tired (carpets did not look particularly clean) and could do with a freshen up overall. Whilst it is nice to have water supplied in the room, the amount of plastic bottles used for this throughout the resort must be enormous. We were supplied with about 4 bottles a day. I’m fairly sure the tap water is drinkable and water is supplied freely everywhere else in the resort, including iced water by the pool. So, I’m unsure why it needs to be supplied in the rooms, but if it does, surely 1 or 2 glass bottles (that shouldn’t be taken from the room) would be the eco friendly way to provide this service. Also there seems to be no option for using towels more than once, so again whilst trying to be eco friendly, the hotel should consider reminding clients (and housekeeping) of this option.

We were very well taken care of at every turn. The rooms are extremely comfortable, spacious with all the amenities you could want. The property itself is massive with all kinds of different room options. The large clean beach is perfect for sunbathing and swimming for all ages. There is a floating anchored raft which is fun to swim out to and jump off of. The snorkeling is very limited. There are plenty of well padded large beach lounge chairs with adjustable canopies up and down the beach and on the massive lawn. The lawn has plenty of room for play. There is a large pool which is slightly overwhelmed by children. The jacuzzi could be larger as it can’t fit enough people that want to use it. The on-site Spa is elegant and the employees, masseuses and masseurs are very professional. The Plumeria Beach House serves a fantastic breakfast buffet; we tended to load up here and have very light lunches. The dinners are okay and the menu is limited. Have someone go down and put your name in for a table at breakfast time, they don’t take reservations the wait can be 30 minutes or more, especially on weekends. Seaside Grill is your standard burgers,sandwiches, nachos and tropical cocktails and non alcoholic cocktails. Convenient but expensive and not memorable. Arancino is a good Italian restaurant. We liked it best for getting excellent pizzas to go, we would pick them up, and bringing them to the beach. Hoku was a disappointment, the food and service weren’t at all matched to the price. The Veranda was visited almost nightly by the 87 year old in our party for a cocktail and to listen to the beautiful live music. Yes the Kahala is very expensive.

To be quite honest, there is room for improvement. I will say that in all the important categories except for physical plant, this hotel does rank 5 stars.What I love:The Location - Quiet area away from the crowds in a good neighborhood. Shopping is almost walkable.The Views - Diamondhead view and the view of the mountains in the opposite direction are equally spectacular.The Food - Breakfast buffet is fantastic. Get a room rate that includes it.What I Like:The Rooms - I like the rooms because they are large. Very spacious in fact. What I didn't Like:Arancini - Just not a great menu. Service was great. Food was just okay.Condition - The age and state of repair of the property is not up to standard. Needs investment.Overall, the staff is fantastic making for a wonderful stay. We will be back.

On a return trip to Honolulu, I’d stay in Waikiki for more convenient access to restaurants and shopping and still a beautiful beach view. For a resort experience, go to another island! Pros:- Nice quiet location in upscale Kahala neighborhood, private beach -Entry level room had a beautiful mountain view and partial ocean view from side window (but no balcony or lanai)- Very friendly and accommodating service at check-in - Comfortable bedding, robes and complimentary coffee and water replenished twice daily- They sent a tray of chocolate covered strawberries on my birthday, which was the purpose of the trip. Cons:- No upgrade despite resort didn’t seem full. We were offered an ocean view room but told it was on a low floor primarily overlooking the porte-cochere and roof construction. No thanks!- Only 1 hot tub and pool. Worked fine for our stay (Monday-Wednesday during a slower season) but would be concerned during peak season.- Rude attendant in fitness area. I entered after a walk on the beach and had sand on my feet so grabbed a towel to wipe it off on the mat outside the door. She ran over and instructed me to brush the sand off away from the mat and then picked up the mat in front of me and shook it out. Really? Isn’t that what a mat is for? - Bathroom tile is chipped and scratched and needs to be replaced. There was paint sloppily splashed on the mini bar cabinetry and bathtub/shower combo caulking was molded. None of this particularly bothersome to me but odd for a luxury hotel room.

Our special occasion was recognized by the management with sparkling wine and treats upon our arrival, a nice touch. Our stay was quite enjoyable; our tenth-floor room (Ocean View with Lanai) was spacious and well-appointed, with only the carpet showing signs of wear. The bed and linens were exceptionally comfortable. As mentioned in numerous reviews, the hotel staff is friendly and accommodating. We were especially impressed with the efficiency of the concierge staff. The sundry “store” (actually just a small portion of the boutique shop) stocks only a minimal number of items, so any needs must be met with a shuttle trip or bicycle ride or long walk to the Kahala Mall. The breakfast buffet is especially lavish, featuring a wide variety of items, both American and Japanese. We found it to be so ample that we usually only ate one other meal, a rather light mid-afternoon item or two at either the Seaside Grill or the Veranda. In fact, we found the two occasions we dined at the upscale Hoku and the Plumeria to be underwhelming, especially the latter, with rather amateurish wait staff and a number of diners’ noisy children playing on the grassy area by the tables. We watched the dolphins frequently, thoroughly enjoying their antics. A note: the tenth floor rooms have a lanai that has no cover, so the south-facing lanai is drenched in sunshine all day—not so suitable for reading or cool lounging. Since mainland US flights depart at night and checkout is noon, we used the very convenient hospitality suite through the afternoon of our departure: it is convenient and comfortable.","Fort Collins, Colorado","marsha m</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Collins, Colorado</strong>",12,4.0

My stay was so wonderful, that I decided to return again this year, and compare the two visits. I can honestly say that this stay was equal to and even better than last year's stay. It seems like the staff either remembered me, or they made me feel like they knew me. Just about everyone addressed me by name, and they always anticipated what I needed, whether it was bringing up my rental car, driving directions, boarding pass printing, or restaurant recommendations. My suite location, complete with balcony and ocean-view, was beautiful and convenient. The suite was comfortable, spacious, very clean, and filled with amenities to enhance my stay. Mr. Glennon, the General Manager, ensured that all of the details of my stay were arranged and communicated with his staff. Kathy, his Executive Secretary, followed through with my car rental arrangements with their own Hertz office at the hotel, efficiently run by Dallas, along with having my materials for my business trip organized and loaded into my rental car. They also arranged for my pick-up by Rainui and drop off by Sahng at Honolulu Airport, who were both cheerful, helpful, and very efficient with their communications so we could easily coordinate our meeting details. Bart, who oversaw the front desk, made sure that I was accompanied to my suite quickly when I arrived, so I did not have to wait at all at the front desk to check in. DeeDee, the concierge, made sure that I got whatever I needed, including her offer to print my airline boarding pass and send it to my room without me even asking her to do it. The parking attendants and bell staff were always available whenever I needed assistance with my car or luggage, and consistently with a big smile.Because I travel for business, I stay in a lot of hotels. The Kahala pampers its guests, and makes everyone feel special. The staff anticipates your needs, and makes sure you have everything taken care of so you can enjoy your stay. They are very gracious, respectful, positive, and caring. They have a wonderful work ethic, which, I believe, is set by their General Manager. You experience it throughout the hotel.I also want to recommend The Plumeria Beach House, the hotel's oceanside restaurant. The setting is beautiful, overlooking the beach, and the menu is very extensive, so there is something for everyone. The food is delicious, and the servers are friendly and helpful. I had a wonderful lunch buffet there which had a huge selection, and everything I ate was delicious, especially the bread pudding and sauce which I had for dessert.The bottom line is that after my two stays, The Kahala has consistently reflected high standards, great accommodations, a beautiful location just outside of Waikiki, and a staff with superior service. It's no wonder that travelers come to vacation there from all over the world. Staying at The Kahala is an experience that you will always remember. I look forward to my return!

In Room 1123, my first assigned ground floor room, the wall repaint when done had left paint splashed over the alarm clock and some of the furniture but failed to address the peeling paint issues elsewhere.The hotel is popular with Japanese visitors, children and everyone who loves seeing dolphins up close.The famous dolphins are very entertaining and very smart .

Though situated away from the maddening touristy crowds of the main waikiki beach, it is easy to get into the thick of things by using the free shuttle of a cheap ride on Lyft.

Remember it is the backyard where president Obama grew up.Ambience of the resort: Elegant simplicity without being ostentatiously ornamented like many resorts.Staff: Professional;fast yet attentive overall and what you would expect from the staff of a luxury hotel Rooms are large and the bathrooms are excellent with wonderful housekeeping twice a day.The view of the ocean was amazing from our ocean view room There are other scenery as well all around especially that of the misty mountains and the famous diamond head. The beach itself is beautiful. The rains that preceded our arrival ,prevented us from getting in to the ocean. Food We ate at all the three restaurants. We usually skip the report food and seek out local fanfare but the breakfast buffet at Plumeria and the sunday seafood brunch at Hoku's are fabulous and nightly lazy time on the Veranda for drinks is relaxing.Overall it was a memorable trip for a landmark occasion.

Upon check in, they were kind enough to upgrade us to a Ocean facing room with a balcony as it was her birthday, which we were very grateful for, and we were able to have great breakfasts on the the balcony, which was an experience on its own. I do admit, the hotel overall can seem a bit dated, however the service that you get, together with the atmosphere, location, and available amenities, make it irrelevant. As it was Spring Break season, the hotel was full of families and young children, which can be a mood breaker at times, especially when the pool and beach are overrun and overcrowded, however it wasn't much of an issue for us as we had planned activities outside for most days. The location is also great because you are away from the very touristy buzz of Waikiki, but close enough to all the spots that its easy to get to. They also have a shuttle service that will take you to several spots in town which was very useful. Overall, I wouldn't think twice about where to stay on Oahu. Kahala is the only option.

It was very spacious, with a large lanai. The bathroom had two sides, each with a closet and drawers and a vanity, so each person had plenty of space. There was a Japanese style toilet with a control panel on the wall. On one bedside table, they provided a plug with multiple connectors for various types of phones/electronics; would have been even better if they were on both sides.I loved the classic feel of the place; it is an older resort, renovated, fresh and clean but built in a way that evoked memories of years gone by - for example, there are external staircases at either end of the wide hallways where you can step out and feel the Hawaiian breezes. Service is excellent, the pool area is not overcrowded and the beach is nicer than Waikiki, secluded and calm. There are some good restaurants onsite, a shopping mall nearby, and Waikiki is a short drive away. We previously stayed out at Ko Olina, which was more remote; I preferred the location of the Kahala, more convenient to activities in Waikiki or downtown Honolulu, yet removed from the crowds.","Seattle, Washington","Seattle98101</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",317,5.0

A great remembrance of our trip.Our room was on the 10th (highest) floor with a great view of the ocean from our lanai.

We pretty much laughed, ate & drank in that order. Memorable restaurants were Gaze, Side Street & Hy’s steakhouse. Be warned you’ll pay top $$ for Hy’s but it was worth it.

I booked the room four months ago and booked a special package by booking early and paying in advance. I would highly recommend doing this because doing so awarded us with $150 worth of resort credits, which you can use for onsite parking and dining. This is by far the nicest hotel we have ever stayed at. From the moment you check in and receive a mint towel and fresh lei, you are treated like royalty. The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The property is intimate and lovely and does not feel like a resort at all, but rather a boutique hotel. The pool is nice and clean, always had plenty of lounge chairs available on the weekend and even though there were children, they were all well-behaved. The beach is lovely, not over-crowded and the water calm. We dined at both Hoku’s and Arancino’s - both are 5-star restaurants. Really exceptional service and food, coming from someone that lives in a big city and knows good food! Highly recommend Hoku’s for brunch. Arancino’s pre-fixe has fantastic options. We booked a photography session with the onsite Pacific Dream Photography last minute and they accommodated our request for a sunrise shoot of our baby bump (maternity photos). The session was complimentary and the photos turned out beautifully. We purchased a package. Loryn and Macy were so great to work with - responsive to texts/emails and very professional and talented. Highly recommend if you want to have special photos taken during your stay. I cannot say enough good things about our stay.

We had two rooms- one for two adults and one for three older teenagers. Our rooms were Ocean View Lanai, so they directly overlooked the arrival circle and parking area, but looked out onto the beachfront and had fantastic views of Diamond Head from the lanai. The rooms are large (the room for the teens had a rollaway and two double beds and still had enough room to get around) and the bathrooms are large and well appointed.The restaurants on site are a little pricey but worth it. We had the breakfast buffet at Plumeria Beach House that was included with our rooms and enjoyed going down daily. We also ate dinner several nights at Plumeria including their seafood buffet on Friday evening- all meals were fantastic. We ate one night at Arancino, the Italian restaurant onsite, and had an amazing meal there. Unfortunately, their signature restaurant Hoku was closed during our stay.The beach is protected enough to make swimming very safe. It's not a great lagoon for snorkeling (water too cloudy) or body boarding (waves break too far out). We did rent stand-up paddleboards, which the teens were brave enough to take out past the reef to where the breakers were. Chairs both at the beach and poolside were available even without reserving in advance.The teens participated in the Dolphin Quest encounter and loved it, but you can enjoy seeing the dolphins without participating as they are easily viewed in their lagoon.

It has charming 1960's architecture and friendly staff who provide great service. This is not a typical Waikiki hotel that many might associate with Honolulu, packed with thousands of tourists who cram onto the beach there, and getting in and out is a nightmare due to the tour buses and traffic jam on the street. The Kahala is in a secluded area of Honolulu, just outside of a quiet residential area, yet it is not prohibitively far from major activities, beaches, and other destinations on the island. It has its own private beach, which gives guests an intimate feel of quiet and privacy. The waves (at least when we were there) were extremely small (virtually nonexistent), meaning it's good for small children or a leisurely swim, but not for those who may be interested in surfing or boogie-boarding. The hotel has a heated swimming pool, a kiddie Jacuzzi, and a salt-water Jacuzzi. The Kahala also has a fish / turtle / dolphin lagoon, where guests can book a swim with the dolphins (if you are comfortable with the ethics of that, it's the place for you, if not, it's not; I won't make judgements). When you check in, you are greeted by friendly staff who give you a fresh lei along with your room keys. The rooms are good and have all the necessary amenities, including showers, baths, ample closet space, and Japanese bidets. The toiletries provided are of good quality. One thing I noticed that was odd was that the television in our room was located off to the side, not above the desk or the bed, could have caused issues (thankfully, I had no intention of watching TV, so it had zero effect on me; also not sure if this was the case in other rooms). The food in the Plumeria Beach House restaurant was spectacular, from the breakfast buffet (which also had a wide variety of choices), to the dinner menu, to the alcoholic beverages and cocktails. The service there was also exceptional, on par with that of the rest of the hotel. The staff apparently provide or arrange good tours of the island, although we did not go on any. Definitely worth a stay if you're looking for hotels on Oahu.","Los Angeles, California","obizerokenobi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",84,5.0

Even if it does not have all the mod cons, marble-everything etc... the hotel has been marvellously AND sympathetically maintained but there is no denying that it IS old. As such, it cannot possibly even be compared to the modern luxury brand properties / resorts (atrocities !), nor should it. Our room was quiet and clean and the bed comfortable. The only gripe I would have is that the towels were - and felt - old / used and could really be replaced more often than they clearly are. As we got a healthy discount on the rack rate I am prepared to overlook this aspect of things and give the Kahala maximum marks. I would probably give it only a four if paying full price.","Pinner, United Kingdom","European1nLondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pinner, United Kingdom</strong>",85,5.0

The Kahala in my opinion is the best place to stay on O'ahu, away from the craziness of Waikiki. ""Upscale"" I suppose but it is a bit tired, the pool is so small and I missed the sound of the waves crashing on the beach. The dolphins (which are a part of Dolphin Quest) are an addicting added bonus and since our balcony overlooked their lagoon we found ourselves sitting out watching them anytime we were in our room. Arancino is amazing and Chelsie is the BEST beach restaurant Server out there (but she was the only Server out there which was a problem). The Kahala takes the ""Relax"" vibe a bit too far but it is easy to dismiss because everyone is so nice. A few more servers, a bit of updating, and follow-through on every level would help to elevate The Kahala to the hotel it is known to be.

We got rained out the first day and they were able to reschedule easily, but the Kahala resort is so nice, we could have done indoor photos too. Both photographers were great with kids and I highly recommend them. We also had a wonderful time on the Holokino Sailing Adventure Tour. Again, great with kids and we saw 3 turtles swimming buy.

Austin taught us how people navigated, the cool places to hike/visit and we all had a great time!The kids also went to the Keikei club and enjoyed it, we booked them in at the last minute and the concierge called my cell phone to make sure that I knew the kids could get in.

We spent 8 days in the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and spent the remaining 5 days at The Kahala. It was our first time at The Kahana and we enjoyed our stay tremendously. All the staff members (people at the front desk, waiters, housekeeping, valet staff) are extremely friendly and very professional. Our room was quite roomy, well appointed and had a covered lanai with comfy chairs. The ocean view from our 5th floor room was a little disappointing as we overlooked the roof of the lobby to the left and the top floor of the parking garage to the right before seeing the ocean. The view from a higher floor room is probably better. The bathroom had a His and Hers sink as well as His and Hers closets and drawers. Also a Toto washlet, a bathtub and separate walk-in shower, however, the handheld shower head doesn’t really belong in a luxury hotel of this category. When traveling through Japan last year we noticed a lot of the hotel showers have temperature controlled showers with both, a rain shower and a handheld shower head. Something to consider..... Turndown service was great, it also included fresh ice in the ice bucket as there are no ice- and vending machines on the floor. A good supply of bottled water is provided daily as is coffee and tea.The breakfast buffet was included with our Costco package and boy, they have one of the best breakfast buffets we’ve ever had! A large variety of breads, juices, fruits, smoked salmon, prosciutto, 5 warm breakfast items, Japanese breakfast items and an omelet station. Breakfast is in the Plumeria restaurant which also has a beautiful lanai overlooking the ocean. If you happen to be there on a Friday or Saturday, don’t miss the Seafood Buffet! A cornucopia of all kinds of seafood, sushi, sashimi, mini lobster rolls and for those craving some meat, they also served a delicious prime roast. Food and service at the Plumeria restaurant were outstanding!We had dinner once at the Seaside Grill where they serve salads, hamburgers and the like. Restaurant Hoku and the Veranda were closed for renovation during our stay. On the day of our departure our flight back to the mainland left in the evening and after checking out we spent some time in the hospitality room. Nice they have such a room, however, the hospitality room is not large enough to accommodate the amount of people using it. There is only one large bathroom with shower, toilet and sink. When we were there the 2 “dark rooms” were filled with guests (one very large family occupying both rooms) who had just arrived and were waiting for their rooms to be ready. When we were at the hospitality room there must have been about 20 guests, the bathroom was always occupied. I had to go to a bathroom on the Lower Level to change, another guest had to go downstairs to change as well. Adding at least a half bathroom would be helpful.There is a warm, welcoming atmosphere at the Kahala, it is a luxury family style hotel catering to guests of all ages.","Littleton, Colorado","791annd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Littleton, Colorado</strong>",48,5.0

Loved the bathroom as well, also quite large, with a large tub and separate large shower area. Two sinks, one on each end, as a his and hers which was also great. Pay the extra money for the ocean view and also for a balcony, it's worth it 2) all inclusive breakfast: very good, large selection with lots of hot options, cereal options, fruit options, bread options, and yogurts. There is a guy who makes inlets and waffles to order. Make sure you try and get it included into your room package as otherwise it's 92 bucks a day for two people. We usually went around 7am and never waited for a seat; servers however were sometimes slow with bringing coffee and were consistently slow about bringing us the check(you had to sign the check even when it's included in your room package)3) Beach: soft sand, very calm and warm waters. Good place for young children. Hammocks available on the beach. There's a sandbar so you can go out far and still stand. There's also a reef to snorkel but didn't see too many fish. Can walk on the right side on the beach for a while which is nice. They have cabanas and also lounge chairs with sun covers on the back of them attached which both cost money, 65 per day for chairs with covers and over 100 for the cabanas per day. I expected the cabanas to cost money but I didn't expect the lounge chairs with covers to cost money as it didn't cost money for the same type of chair when we stayed at a resort on the big island. This made me grumpy as I get easily sunburned. Luckily, there's a large tree on the middle of the property which I was able to drag the lounge chairs which did not have covers and thus were free under each day. This tree provided great shade, but routinely dropped small flowers on us (and I had to pick out of my hair) and also we had birds poop on our lounge chairs twice. Resort provides chair towels and beach towels at no cost which is nice and of good quality 4) Pool: warm water, reasonable size, only goes about 4.5 deep. One small kiddie pool. One hot tub. Always crowded and noisy with lots of children, they needed more pool space with the size of the hotel. Chairs at the side of the pool at times can be hard to come by 5) Dolphins: I'm conflicted about this. I liked watching the dolphins and think this is very unique to have on a resort. They also offered dolphin experiences to those willing to pay. Dolphins seemed well taken care of. However, I'm conflicted because I'm starting to become against keeping such beautiful and intelligent animals in captivity 6) Lunch: we ate at the beach side open air cafe which had a large menu. I consistently ate off the kids menu which they let me do because I'm picky and like those portion sizes better. Lunch was around 32 bucks daily for two people not including tip7) location: it is true that it is out of the main city where most hotels are. It is true that it's close to attractions in the city, Pearl Harbor is about 30 minutes, dole is 40 minutes, Waimea bay is 25 minutes. Close to lots of restaurants and even a mall. However, it's very much suburbs and it takes away from the resort tropical island feel. It's a very different setting from Maui or the big island where you feel removed from it all. This bothered my husband and I more then expected, we really wanted the tropical island away from it all vacation- if this is want you want, I would recommend trying the turtle beach resort instead 8) Random: service was good. Beautiful entrance into the hotel. They offer free photo session but we didn't do it because of the weather the week we stayed. Parking is expensive but equivalent to any other resort on the island. Construction closed down half the gym while we're were there which irritated my husband- small gym only one piece of equipment per type such as treadmill and rapidly became crowded even with only five people in the room. No nightly activities/entertainment offered that we were aware of. ","York, PA","Wanderingfree9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>York, PA</strong>",39,4.0

From the views , to the decor to the incredible staff ( my son was in love with Ying at front desk who gifted him a stuffed dolphin) our experience was incredibleCheck in was wonderful- the close proximity to the city was great- we felt detached from the craziness of Waikiki without being isolated. For 4 days we toured the island, and for 2 days spent it on the beach and pool. We rented a cabana for $165 which was well worth it- we put the 2 chairs with a small deck chair and we all slept outdoors with the cool sea breezeThe food was incredible- fresh and the buffet was delicious. What I appreciated was the mock tail list ( I’m 4 months preggers) so the fact I could have delicious drinks made me feel like I was on holiday modeI usually want to leave after a few days away from home - this time I really had problems getting on the plane- my son actually cried on the way to the airport since he didn’t want to head out.

So keep in mind it is harder to stay here if you want to be in Waikïkï a lot. If you would rather stay on property or you are renting a car anyway, then this place is good.The staff is super friendly. Check in was smooth. My favorite thing was the concierge will communicate with you by text message if you want! This worked well for me since that is my easiest mode of communication!The hotel room was lovely. My only complaint was that due to a window above our bed, it was hard to Black out the whole room for a mid-day nap. The bath products provided were nice and not super perfumed which is good. The rooms had a safe and a fridge which was stocked w bottled water.If you are a runner, it is easy enough to run nearby. The front desk will give you water and a running map if needed.Although the rooms have a Keurig, there is also complimentary coffee on the ground floor in the mornings.We did the breakfast inclusive option and the buffet at Plumeria House was amazing! So many things to choose from like omelets to waffles w coconut syrup to miso soup as well as salad and dumplings. The fruit bar was also wonderful. Different juices every day.Lastly, I’ve done dolphin swimming a few times so we didn’t do it here but you could still watch the dolphins which was nice and fun! Oh and the beach was super calm without big waves. Saw some people doing SUP yoga and looked not too bad since almost no waves. Probably a good beach for kids that way.","Boston, Massachusetts","skimmilk70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",55,5.0

The hotel boasts old style charm, the lobby is beautifully furnished, all the staff are professional and gracious, and the rooms have a feeling of warmth and comfort. It's lovely to sit on one's balcony and enjoy morning coffee while overlooking the ocean and beach as well as the dolphins playing in the pool (assuming you get a room with an ocean view), or in the evenings watching the sunset with a glass of wine. The beach is beautiful and uncrowded; often you get to enjoy a fabulous wedding of a beautiful Japanese couple with their family. The buffet breakfasts are sumptuous with awesome fresh fruit and tropical juices. The concierge staff are all gracious, professional, and accessible -- one of the lovely concierge's helped us with our plans daily and was often willing to refresh our leis -- Susan was wonderful!!!! The hotel registration staff was also pleasant and accommodating. I'm so happy we took the concierge's advice to hire a private sedan for airport transportation! A shuttle bus takes you into Waikiki for shopping and dining throughout the day (so very appreciated!!!!).

The checkin staff were a little curt and even though they knew it was our honeymoon, we didn't get any sort of acknowledgement. Pretty poor really. The room we paid for cost a small fortune and didn't even include breakfast (we found this out when we got there). It didn't even occur to us that breakfast wouldn't be included for a £650 a night hotel. Our fault for not double checking though. In the hotel's defence, they did give us free breakfast for the two mornings we were there, so in the end I guess it was a nice thing to do.The room was stunning - again it was the room we paid for, but we were really disappointed not to get an upgrade, especially as the hotel was not sold out. The first morning we were there, my lovely hubby jumped downstairs to reserve a cabana on the beach. He was charged $100 by a member of staff from The Khahala. When we came back to our room and told me what happened I lost the plot! Number one, we didn't realise that they charge you money to sit on the flaming beach if you want an umbrella in Honolulu, but $100 for the cabana?! Eh no! Turns out that it was half that price to reserve one and the member of staff had pocketed the money. I'm sure you can imagine we were furious with the hotel and arguing with members of management on the first day of our honeymoon was not the start we were looking for. We got our money back but seriously saddened that this happened to us. From that moment on we had a pretty sour taste in our mouths about the hotel. While there we made the best of it, but I would not recommend staying there.Another thing: The dolphin pool is shockingly small. As a massive animal lover this should be shut down. You'll see how small it is when you get there. The pool for humans is the smallest hotel pool I've ever seen (hmm is that so you go and sit at the beach to get conned out of $100?).

It is in Honolulu, but away from Waikiki. Unless you are looking for a city Hawaii vacation, the Kahala is the only great hotel near enough to Honolulu to enjoy the great food and shopping Waikiki has to offer, but far enough away to avoid the hustle and bustle. There's good news and bad news in this. The bad news is a taxi or Uber ride into downtown Waikiki will set you back $35 each way. The hotel offers a shuttle into Waikiki, but inexplicably, this bus is in pretty bad shape. Tip - Stay in the front at all costs. The rear axle may fall off at any moment.The other unique thing about Kahala is its Dolphin Lagoon. The hotel has 6 of the friendliest, most entertaining dolphins anywhere. Book a Dolphin Lagoon room and you will be endlessly entertained by these beautiful animals. Here's another tip - make sure you're not booked into 1206 or 1207. If you are, you will be looking partly at Dolphins, but mostly at the back side of the hotel's tower. When I requested a room change, I was only offered an ocean front room for $100 more per night.There were other issues which prevent me from otherwise endorsing this Hotel. There is construction going on outside the Plumeria Restaurant, which is the indoor/outdoor restaurant where a beautiful and included breakfast buffet is served daily. Why this construction is not scheduled after the buffet hours is inexplicable. During our stay, each morning we were greeted with a view of construction workers and not the Pacific Ocean, along with the attendant noise.Equally hard to explain is that the hotel offers comfortable lounge chairs and umbrellas pool side, but a few steps away on the beach, the lounge chairs are free, but the same umbrella costs $30/per hour. The beach itself is beautiful and faces west towards the sunset. If you want a beautiful view (and I mean really beautiful), but not a sun tan, this view is unavailable without significant additional cost.",,732laurences,19,4.0

We had an Ocean Front Lanai and three teenage sons had a Scenic View room. This is a beautiful, classic property that is completely opposite of the Waikiki experience (which is only 10-15 minutes away if you want night life/shopping etc.). The rooms were larger than we expected and well-appointed. We were on the 10th floor (after originally being given a room on the second floor, which the front desk smartly fixed) in the Koko Head wing and had an amazing view, as well good size bathrooms/plenty of closet space/separate vanities/tub/shower. The balcony was quite large. The boys' room was on the other side but had a large (man-made) waterfall view that was cool.The pool area is on the small side, but the beach is quite large and water is calm/not rocky (the teenagers particularly enjoyed swimming out to the floating dock). We didn't hang out there for a meaningful amount of time so can't comment on pool/beach service, but the tiki bar wasn't overwhelmingly busy. There is a Dolphin Quest facility on the property, right next to the pool area, which we didn't experience but was great to watch them feeding or a show. There are also sea turtles and many other fish species swimming in the other ponds. The main restaurant Hokus was closed for renovation but we all really enjoyed Arancino also on property (good wine list). Plumeria was fine for breakfast, but got busy after 7:30 or 8:00a.The gym was standard fare, nothing to write home about but fine. There's a nice run along the main road (beautiful neighborhood) up to Diamond Head and the old lighthouse though.

The reservation/front desk staff were unhelpful - not willing to guarantee us a connecting room when we were travelling with our 2 young children. There was a 20 min wait for breakfast on the weekend and the place was like a zoo with building works happening right in front of the breakfast venue not what you would expect from an upmarket hotel. We thought the resort facilities would be great so close to Waikiki but golf is not available on site as it is a private club, tennis was not simple to book either being part of the club. The place is tired and is nowhere near the top hotels on Waikiki as far as service, location or amenities go.

The hotel facilities have an old-world charm to them and the service was impeccable. The hotel is located at the end of an upscale, high end neighborhood, about 15 min drive outside of Waikiki. It's not really walking distance to anything, so you'd need transportation (rental car or Uber) if you want to get around. It is situated in a quiet, protected beach, with lots of beachfront access, easy swimming, and good stand-up paddle space. There is a tower with ocean front and garden view rooms, a smaller building with a view of an internal lagoon, and a few rooms right in front of the ocean.The lagoon inside the hotel is home to 6 male dolphins in an operation managed by Dolphin Quest Oahu. I have mixed feelings about having these animals in captivity. But, as a tourist, it was great entertainment to watch their daily shows, feedings, and trainings. Other quick points about the hotel:Pros:- Great service from check in to check out (I love it that they still offer 3PM check and noon check out!)- Nice restaurant for breakfast buffet right in front of the beach- Pool attendants were always available and willing to help. Chairs were not too hard to find in the middle of the day- Quick valet service- Daily housekeeping and turn down service- Spacious room with great view- We had some problems with check in that were quickly addressed. We later received a handwritten apology note from the front desk manager - well done!Cons:- Family rooms have 2 double beds (rather than queen beds)- Small pool- The hotel was built in 1964 and, while updated in many ways, there are still some items that feel original, like the painted wood cabinets in the bathroomAll said, this was a lovely way to end a Hawaiian vacation and we highly recommend the property.","Menlo Park, California","allplanetsearch</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Menlo Park, California</strong>",71,5.0

The room was lovely, spacious and very well appointed. I visited the spa - which was first rate. We did a little shopping and found the staff helpful and the prices not unreasonable for hotel shop0s.

My only caution is that I would not book here unless we were planning to spend our time in HNL. The HNL traffic is not good and although the Kahala is very well located, it's impossible to reach any of the historic sites, whale-watching, Waikiki or downtown area attractions without spending 30-45 minutes in traffic.

We booked via Costco Travel and got a good deal on a suite with an ocean vie. Reception was typical of nice resorts in Hawaii--""relax, have a smoothie, here is a flower lei."" It works well. The rooms are large and comfortable. The ocean view suites look straight out on the shades of blue from the beach to the reef and the horizon. The beach is private and easy for kids--gentle slope with a protected reef. I was able to swim open water inside the reef. I love breakfast and the buffet here is one of my favorites in the world--lots of fresh fruit, great bread, Japanese and Chinese items and made to order omlettes. The service is attentive and high class. If you want to see the sights of Oahu but pass on the bustle of Waikiki, this is an excellent alternative.","Bainbridge Island, Washington","Tom B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bainbridge Island, Washington</strong>",13,5.0

We tend to like quieter settings and to alternate between sightseeing days and lazy beach lounging days.Some specific impressions:We felt warmly welcomed and cared for by all the staff, from Noel who checked us in and found us a room away from the elevator to Kei (? spelling) who helped us load our car as we checked out. The couple times we called for assistance, the response was rapid and handled expertly and cheerfully (even when we didn't realize that the A/C was not broken, but designed not to operate when the door to the balcony was open :) ).We enjoyed breakfast at the Plumeria House each day, and also had a dinner at least once at Plumeria House, Hoku's and Arancino. We enjoyed the creative menu at Arancino the best.We enjoyed the easy beach access tremendously. The beach was clean and the waters were calm. The service to assist with cabana rentals/towels etc. was friendly and helpful. There is a small group of fish that hang out under the raft off of the beach; we also saw a large sea robin in the water.All in all, we felt our trip was a fantastic experience and that The Kahala provided excellent value for a couple looking for a luxurious, relaxing babymoon.","Wexford, Pennsylvania","CMRrocks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wexford, Pennsylvania</strong>",3,5.0

I’ve tried to think of anything negative to say, but I can’t come up with anything. Is it expensive - yes. But you get what you pay for in this case.From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly and treated exceptionally well by everyone at the resort. The bellmen, front desk staff, and housekeepers were all outstanding and seemed to willing to do whatever was necessary to make our stay enjoyable. The building and property, even though its about 50 years old, are in very good condition. The lobby is very nicely decorated, open and inviting. The beach and pool areas are immaculate. The pool itself is small and was sometimes crowded. The dolphin pond was large, and it was amazing to be so close to these wonderful animals. Although I am conflicted about the dolphins being in captivity, they are extremely well cared for, fed, and trained.Our room was on the 3rd floor and had a view of the golf course and the peaks beyond. It was very large, with a great lanai outside. The bed was comfortable, it was very clean and had a couch and chair in addition to a desk/chair combo. The bathroom itself was big, although the walk-in shower was rather small. There was also a tub, 2 sinks, 2 closets plus a refrigerator/coffee area. The bathroom was separated from the main area by double doors. The toilet had its own door inside the bathroom, and it had a heated seat and a remote control which performs a myriad of functions that I never figured out.We ate at 3 of the restaurants at the property. We had dinner at Plumeria Beach House twice. The food was excellent, and the service was even better. The waiters were very friendly, talkative and informative about the resort and Hawaii. There was also live music one night that we saw, and it was very enjoyable (I believe there is live music every night but we only saw it once). We also had breakfast here one morning and it was very good. The buffet looked fabulous, but was around $40/person.We had drinks and lunch one day at the Seaside Grill. This is much more causal, with seating right next to the beach. Unfortunately it is not open for dinner which I found disappointing. The food was good, and it was very comfortable. We also had dinner once at Arancino, which is an Italian restaurant at the resort. The food was very good here as well.Several things to be aware of here - you pay extra for almost everything except some of the activities (Paddleboard Yoga, for example, didn’t cost extra). But Rental of a paddleboard for an hour is $30. Rent mask/fins/snorkel - you pay.There is a shuttle that runs from the resort to several areas around Waikiki. Because the timing was never right for us, we never used it. We always took Uber to go anywhere. I was initially concerned that there might be limited availability of Ubers because of the location, but we never waited more than 5 minutes for a ride. It would cost around $13-$15 to get to the middle of Waikiki. Overall the Kahala definitely lived up to its reputation as a 5-star resort. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again, and probably will.","Yorktown, Virginia","Kevin M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorktown, Virginia</strong>",10,5.0

Having read all the reviews, I was greatly looking forward to it and expecting something special. We were however very disappointed. Firstly on checkin mid-morning, our room wasnt ready and there was clearly no interest from the front desk person in getting us a room any earlier than than 3 pm “guaranteed” time. But wait, we could offer you an upgrade to a better room if you want access earlier - only another 300 / 400 a night - how about that sir? Oh, on top of the 750+ we’re already paying you mean? No problem trying to upsell me, but then trying to make us look cheap by refusing the new fantastic offer was pretty insulting at these rates. A promise to call us when the room was ready was made, but no call ever came. We eventually went into Waikiki, instead of hanging out for hours in the “hospitality suite”, and returned in the evening, requested our room key and pointed out no one had bothered to contact us to tell us the room was available. Sorry sir. Then throw in the “voluntary” contribution toward regenerating trees or something that they added on by default, the big sell to join LHW which would give us free wifi for our stay (seriously?) and, fair to say, first impressions of the hotel were pretty bad. The room itself was big and comfortable. Relief. Weird setup though with the bar and coffee maker in the bathroom and the hanging closets/drawers in the bathroom too. Room cleaners service was outstanding - very friendly and always left the room Immaculate. Next morning was a 30min wait for breakfast. Oh, you didn’t make a breakfast reservation sir ? We were on to it the next morning though - made a reservation and then watched all the other first day guests wait like we had. Breakfast buffet was pretty good though once we got in. The Italian restaurant onsite (Arancino) was very good, if a bit pricey. The limited shuttle times meant that we gave Uber a pretty serious workout heading backwards and forwards from Waikiki with the kids. As other reviewers have commented, the pool is very small and overrun with kids. Really not up to standard. Biggest gripe though would be the age and condition of the hotel in general - it’s really very old. Needs a total refurb from rooms to facilities. Old furniture, old carpets, old bathrooms, old facilities although is no doubt well maintained for its age. Room sizes and bathroom sizes are great too. Beautiful setting no doubt, lovely feel to it, airy lobby and relaxed vibe, nice staff (except at check in), lovely beach and location etc but....just very old and lack8ng what you would expect at this price. Yes I know all the rich and famous have stayed there but if you look at the wall of photos in the lobby, there are very few from recent years. Says a lot I think. It’s glory days would have been 20 years ago or more. If you want 5 stars (and we did), sorry to say that this ain’t it. Not even close.",,Geebee1010,28,3.0

The room was spacious, clean, and had everything you could need. The resort itself has several fine restaurants. Arancino was our favorite, but the Plumeria House was amazing as well. And you have to do the breakfast buffet there. However, we spent most of our time on the beach. It was wonderful. Food and drink were close by at the Seaside Bar and Grill and the beach had excellent lounge chairs and towels. The beach there is very, very calm. You could easily bring very small children there and feel safe with them playing at the shore with you. When we did leave the resort, the shuttle was excellent to the Kahala Mall where there are some decent stores and restaurants that you can grab a meal at. The shuttle also takes you into Waikiki if you like. The service was polite, very accomodating, but very much ""as needed"" and therefore you weren't overwhelmed by service employees bothering you.

I had done extensive research before planning our trip, hoping to find the perfect place to stay. We found exactly what we were looking for in the Kahala. It is not located among the crowds of Waikiki, but is close enough that you can easily visit on the hotel-provided complimentary shuttle (Our driver Gary was wonderful!). We also looked into staying in the Ko Olina area, but it was more expensive and way too far away from everything for us. We were able to spend a great deal of time relaxing at the resort, plus have adventures in Waikiki. We also rented a car for 2 days so that we could adequately explore the other parts of the island. It was really the perfect balance. We stayed in a Dolphin Lanai room, and I highly recommend this. We used our lanai daily, and were pleasantly surprised to find we not only had a view of the dolphins but also of the ocean. The room was very clean, thanks to our wonderful housekeeping staff member, Lino. I have seen some complaints on here of rooms being out of date and run down. The furniture does have some wear, but everything is spotless and the bed was so comfy! The room and the bathroom were both spacious. Our package included breakfast at the Plumeria Beach House each morning, and this was a great way to start each day. We ate such a wholesome breakfast each day, that we often found we could share a meal for dinner and still be stuffed! This helped cut down on food costs. The beach at the Kahala is beautiful, and you will never have to struggle to find a chair to relax in. After reading other hotel reviews where you have to get up at 7am to find a beach chair before they are all gone, I realized what a luxury it was to not have to worry about this! There are two things I thought of that would have helped enhance our visit. One would be to add some type of ottoman to the lanai furniture, as we would have loved to stretch out more. The other would be to offer some type of happy hour or daily drink special, as all drinks onsite were pretty pricey. These were definitely not things that were “make or break”, but just things we thought of. We will definitely return!

I've travelled the Hawaiian islands for many years and have stayed at many hotels and resorts. Though all of me stays have been great, Each time I was wishing for something that was lacking. Maybe the beach was too rough, or there weren't enough pool lounges, or I had to pay for beach lounges, or it was a little too crowded, or I wasn't happy with the restaurants. Sometimes the hotel was too impersonal, or worse, the hotel was too personal. There was always something that made it not quite perfect.But the Kahala was perfect...at least for me. We stayed 4 days in the dolphin lanai and 4 days n an iceanview lanai in the tower. Both rooms were wonderful and roomy, can't really say which I prefer. There was more light in the tower room, but it was fun to watch the dolphins from the lanai in the other room. The breakfast buffet at the Plumeria is the perfect way to start the day, plenty of fresh fruit, omelets made to order, fantastic Kona coffee, sausages, potatoes, and much more. beach is beautiful and uncrowded, the chaise are free and are cushioned and comfortable. There are plenty of pool lounges too, also cushioned and plenty of umbrellas. The staff is always responsive and accommodates any requests. We also tried Arancino restaurant, it was ok, but perhaps overrated. We used room service a few times and it was just fine. We also took the free shuttle to Waikiki and the Kahala mall for some meals.

Nice rooms; comfortable bed; we had an ocean view with a balcony, and the balcony is a nice plus. Nice bathroom; not large, but nice tub and separate walk-in shower; one sink, refrigerator. You see the back side of Diamond Head, a different profile, and with the mountains in the background, there was pretty much a daily rainbow. Nice swimming beach with calm water, not as clear as Waikiki. Nice pool with ample seating; not the usual rush to get chairs in the AM. Friendly and accomodating staff and housekeeping. Nice Italian restaurant on premises for lunch and dinner: Arancino (see my review); nice outdoor dining at the Sea Grill for light bites on a beach day. And of course the Dolphin pool/show, which is quite different. It's directly next to Waialae Country Club, though no privileges to play golf there. If you're looking for resort laid back, then you'll probably prefer Kahala over Waikiki. The drawback is it takes a lot more time to get an Uber or Lyft, though both are available, and obviously the cost goes up if you're going into Honolulu proper for dinner, sightseeing, etc. So it's really a function of whether you want quiet resort, or the action of Waikiki. One thing we thought could use improvement is a better stocked store for snacks, drinks, espresso, etc, e.g. a Take and Go....nice refrigerator in the room, but you'll have to hit the ABC store to stock it; Keurig in the room, but not espresso, which means room service. There is free coffee during the earlier morning hours down on the LL level.

One of the most gorgeous features (and there are many) is the orchid wall - a staircase connects the lobby to the lower lobby, and the wall has been planted with an incredible collection of exotic orchids. Just stunning.The lobby area is really quite breathtaking. The restaurants were all top-notch. The hotel also features neat little lagoons stocked with colourful reef fish, a sting ray, two sea turtles, and, of course, dolphins. The beach and ocean cove are lovely and very kid friendly - even with gusting winds, the waves were calm and kid-safe. The water off the beach is very very shallow - we went snorkelling out to the wave break and the water wasn't much higher than 2 or 3 feet. The snorkelling off the beach is just ""meh"" for more avid snorkellers, but it would be a good, safe intro for kids or less confident swimmers.The drinks and pool/beach-side restaurant are particularly excellent - drinks were never far away while out relaxing in the sun, and the fish tacos are 10/10.The business centre was also very helpful - I was able to print some documents and have them scanned seamlessly and with assistance from very friendly staff. Staff also made arrangements to courier the materials via FedEx. It was an easy place to get work done (even when I'd rather be at the beach).The room was great - we were late arrivals and the hotel was jammed for the conference, so we had two double beds, but there was a double his/her vanity on either side of the bathroom, a giant shower and soaking tub, and plenty of storage.

There is a wall of photos of such guests which is fun to view. Apart from the Obamas, however, who do still put in appearances, this hotel has dropped off a bit, with the decor and maintenance showing as much, and yet the prices are still high.The staff at the front and bell desks, concierge, formal restaurants and bar tend to be very nice, with some standouts including Gary the bus driver who is a gentleman with a large amount of local knowledge. The pool and main restaurant staff are a little harder to deal with as they are busy - ask the wrong person for an item of cutlery and the response is a harried ""I'll get your server"". Regrettably, you'll be told that things can't be done (e.g. a table in the pool bar area), but $50 later they can be done. Guests then get competitive.The ""beach front"" rooms are that in name only. You'll face a six-deep throng of deck chairs to wade through to get to the sea. That would be fine if only there was adequate disclosure beforehand. To be fair to the hotel, we understand the State government has apparently changed the law regarding public access to the beach, and this has affected hotel layouts and planning in that area.The carpets in some of the bedrooms are in dire need of a steam clean, while others are fine. Paint is peeling in some areas of the hotel but not others. It needs a bit more work.We had a good time and the hotel is a nice place to stay. But given the above issues, the prices that they charge are too steep in the circumstances.

We knew 4 other families who were visiting this past holiday time. Apparently the hey-day for this property was back in the 80's, but the same folks keep coming back for 30-40 years! So there was a very congenial feel, where everyone sort of knew each other, or at least the regulars. The service is very good and the staff are very friendly (although that is typical for Hawaii and one of the reasons we love to visit). The hotel is located about 15 minutes from Waikiki Beach, in a residential area known as the ""Beverly Hills"" of Oahu. It was very quiet and away from the crowds of Waikiki. They offer a free shuttle to the main malls in Waikiki, including ala Moana, but they were not very convenient and we just took Ubers pretty much everywhere. Although the Kahala bumps right up against the Wailae Golf course, hotel guests do not have access to the private club and you cannot play there (but I heard that other hotels can get you on). The resort is very small and the pool is VERY small. But there were no issues getting a lounge chair at this very busy time of year. There is a reef that protects the beach, so the water is calm and you don't have to worry about huge waves. They have a little ""Moana"" style outrigger canoe that you can hire to take you out for a little tour, which was fun. The rooms are large and feel a bit old school. They definitely take care of the hotel (it's very clean) and have updated it, but have not done a complete gut renovation. The ""Japanese"" style self-cleaning toilet/bidets were a bit annoying. The concierge was amazing and helped us secure reservations at local restaurants and a tee time at Hawaii Kai before we arrived. Make sure you get a room package that includes breakfast--the breakfast buffet is very pricey (I think it was around $50 per person) and there isn't a grab and go option. Otherwise you can get room service. The on-site Dolphin Quest is also very pricey, but having never done it before, I was happy to be able to share that experience with my daughter. It was really special to walk the grounds and see the dolphins everyday.","Los Angeles, California","luv2travel00270</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",23,4.0

Rooms were clean and comfortable. You could tell the housekeeping staff took great pride in taking care of the rooms throughout the week. Was so nice to have everything literally at our feet. The beach was beautiful with calm water for the kids, when they weren't in the ocean they were in the pool or looking at the dolphins in the lagoon. The beachside service was really good with drinks and food at the Seaside grill. Enjoyed the breakfast buffet and several dinners at the Plumeria and great Italian cuisine at Arancino. The concierge staff took great care of us, whether setting up activities and meals or providing us with towels on our way out the door for tours or trips to Waikiki. It seemed nothing was too great or too small for them. We weren't sure about booking at the Kahala with it being away from Waikiki but after experiencing the past week it was the perfect choice.

We requested for housekeeping to come in and make our bed that morning so that it wouldn't be messy during our ceremony (our parents and siblings would be our only guests). Not only did someone come in to make the bed, she changed the sheets, took out the trash, tidied up, and left us more bottles of water.

Granted, I do have fond childhood memories of this hotel. It's absolutely an institution in the Honolulu area. It is that rare location that manages to feel impressive and cozy at the same time. Maybe it's the warm, fragrant, tropical breezes that waft throughout the open air architecture that manage to make the incredibly high ceilings feel warm.Even if you can't be a guest, go and visit. Eat at a restaurant, have tea, watch the dolphins frolic. Even if you drive up in a complete beater of a car (which I've done many times since I loved driving my grandfather's beater VW beetle when he had it), the staff will treat you well. The valets used to jostle good-naturedly over who got to park my grandpa's car.The restaurants I've eaten at are all fantastic, although The Veranda with its fantastic tea service and dinner-time fusion cuisine, is my favorite.I stayed in a room overlooking the dolphin lagoon which was nice, although the rooms that look out towards the beach have the luxury of having their own lounge chairs facing the ocean!The rooms in the original, low building are quite large. My bathroom had two sinks, two closets, and a separate tub/shower. Not sure what the rooms in the high tower look like.My favorite perk at the Kahala is that their pool is open 24 hours.

The hotel offered a complimentary photography session and since we wanted to capture our trip, we decided to take it on. I should note my husband really hates having his picture taken but He agreed to participate. We met with Loryn on a Tuesday morning, honestly so disappointed that we had awoken to rain. She was professional and courteous and asked us if we preferred to reschedule, but encouraged us to give it a shot. Let me say, from beginning to end, Loryn was amazing. We have a 5 year old and a 2 year old and I cannot BELIEVE the photos that she was able to capture with two little children and a dreary sky. She is extremely talented with working with kids and was somehow able to get both of our children captured with ease. I was probably near tears when we started because it meant to much to me to get some nice pictures on this once in a lifetime trip and I thought the weather had ruined it. Loryn clearly knows her stuff, posed us in natural poses so that we didn't feel awkward or uncomfortable and knocked them out of the park! I cannot express how talented she is. The packages are reasonably priced and Loryn was so patient as we painstakingly had to go through the process of picking which ones we wanted (they were all so good it was very hard to choose!). Once we selected, we had our gallery in hand within a couple of hours. I wouldn't hesitate in the slightest to use Loryn or Pacific Dream Photography on our next Hawaiian trip!

Things have changed a bit but the most important ways, have stayed the same. The friendliness, charm, and great staff still possess this hotel. The dolphins are still here but it seems like they expanded the dolphin pond, I don’t remember it being a small lake! The one important thing that’s changed is the busy-ness. This peaceful resort isn’t as peaceful around the holidays anymore. In fact, it is stressful and slammed. I think it is due to social media and ease of “word of mouth” through sites like TripAdvisor. There were too many weddings too, almost every day, meaning, brizedilla and crew descend upon the place and take over the hotel, restaurants, best views and quaint ocean spots. There’s also a tremendous amount of foreign visitors, which I don’t mind, but I overheard racist visitors from White America laughing with each other and complaining how this is an “Asian—-bleep—-Hotel.” Other than that, any issue we had was dealt with professionally and immediately by staff and management. We were so happy in our room that we barely went outside and didn’t leave the premises for 6 entire days! I’ve never been so luxuriously gluttonous. My only activity was to sleep and eat.

There is a hall with pictures of the rich and famous ""names"" from around the world who stayed as guests of the Kahala, spanning several decades.

All of them are quiet, beautifully decorated, and include advanced Toto Washlet automated bidet systems on the toilet. Generous windows have blackout drapes that fit perfectly. Maid service 2x per day that will spoil you for any other hotel. Four dining options span the gamut from internationally-recognized chefs to simple beachfront meals. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe, with homes (and some international embassy properties) that range in value from $1.7 million to about $34 million. Avid runners should get a jogging map from the reception desk to avoid certain streets that are too narrow for safe pedestrian use. A wide coral reef protects the hotel's beachfront from big waves, making it exceptionally safe and easy for all levels of swimmers. For surfers, the breaks are at least .3 miles out, but paddling in the area is easy. The pod of male Atlantic Bottlenose dolphins in the hotel's integrated dolphin lagoon live their entire lives there, meeting and playing with thousands of human visitors (including, now, me) along with their dedicated, respectful human trainers. The joy and playful intelligence of the dolphins is wonderful to experience up close. The hotel offers familiar luxury services, such as spa, gift shop, room service and so forth, but in each case with distinctive passion for excellence.

We obviously keep coming back which is a good sign.This trip was a little different. We stayed the entire time at the resort for a total of eight nights. We did mix it up by spending the first 4 nights in a Dolphin Lagoon room and then 4 in an Ocean Front Suite in the Tower.We barely left the resort and spent most of the time on the beach in a cabana. I honestly don't know what I can say that would be new about the hotel, rooms etc. that isn't already in one of my prior reviews. So I will give a few tips.If you do book a Dolphin Lagoon room, push as hard as you can for an upper room. We were in a lower, which was fine, but having stayed in an upper previously, they are definitely better for watching the dolphins.We knew we wanted to use a beach cabana every day so we just talked to the beach/pool team on the first day and asked them to set it up for us every day. That way we always had the one we chose and it was set up really early.We found the food to be even better than on prior stays. We had a great meal at Hoku's, the breakfast buffet is amazing, the club sandwich at the Veranda was really yummy, I could go on and on! This is part of why we hardly left the resort.Comparing the two rooms, not surprisingly the service while in the suite was better - no missed turndowns, prompt room make up. Not a huge deal but I did note it. We were on the 7th floor while in the suitr and on this stay there was an issue with the hot water - at times it took a REALLY long time to make it to our room. Maybe not many guests in the tower thus no one pulling water, but we would literally have to start the shower and then wait 5-10 minutes before it was warm. If you do a suite, we recommend one at the end of the hall (the ""13"" rooms rather than the ""1"" rooms - we were in 713). These rooms have an extra window and are more quiet.I have to recognize Carlos the front desk supervisor. He went above and beyond in helping us transition between rooms and ensuring we got the room we wanted.

During our shoot, we took my maternity photos of myself, family photos with my husband and daughter, and we even took Holiday photos for our Holiday card. The whole experience with Loryn was very unique and special because she cared about the details...she had all the angles covered making sure we had and the memories we wanted to capture for our photos! Even my 5 year old had fun during the shoot. I highly recommend Loryn-Pacific Dream Photography for your photo shoot, I had over 100 plus shots to choose from and it was heartbreaking to have to select our photos for our package because they were all AMAZING!",,Amnes G,0,5.0

As we prepared for our visit, we researched the hotel and was pleased to see they offered a complimentary photo shoot with your stay. Being a family with two young girls (one who is not fond of photo taking) we figured this would be the perfect place to hopefully get some tear free pictures.After a few days enjoying the pool, and the beautiful beach Kahala offers, we booked our sunrise photo shoot with Loryn as she was highly reccomended. Our photo shoot experience was more than I ever expected. Loryn was so patient with us and eager to get us a variety of photos. She made our 2 year old feel so special that she danced and laughed which resulted in the most beautiful pictures. The following day we met up for our viewing and were shocked to see a video that included photos as well as video clips Loryn he taken throughout the shoot.Needless to say we enjoyed the Kahala resort and it's beautiful beach but we loved our experience with Loryn and Pacific Dream Photography.

We were told we would be able to get into the room before 2pm which in fact turned out to be 3:05pm.Due to year on year price rises on the suites we booked a dolphin room, however our room had no privacy and as soon as we opened the sliding door we were greeted with a group with the dolphins all looking over and in and no privacy at all with the rooms on either side. We changed rooms and again the service was exceptional and very understanding and did look after us with this change all be it we waited another hour.We had two beds instead of one king and the two beds are really a bit of a joke as they are like king singles.

We loved how peaceful the whole resort was. We thought we would have spent the majority of our time at the pool but instead walked 5 more steps to the beach! There were always multiple people ready to help us with the set up of our lounge chairs and towels (but it was such an easy set up that we did it for ourselves most of the time). All of the food we ate at the different onsite restaurants was delicious and again served with such warm hospitality (we especially enjoyed our service from Randy at the Plumeria). My husband LOVED swimming with dolphins and wished he could have every day. We were so impressed with how many different things the Kahala had onsite that we only went down to Waikiki (on the free hotel shuttle, which saves you a $40 round trip taxi ride...) just once! The icing on the cake was our experience with Loryn and Pacific Dream Photography. We set up an appointment with ease and ended up having a sunrise session (which we HIGHLY recommend- the lighting was perfect and it wasn't even humid yet). Loryn did such a fabulous job on our pictures that we decided we had to buy all of them, and the video she made! Such a timeless keepsake.

The concierge staff was especially helpful! My only complaint is that with one notable exception, the pool/beach staff aren't very helpful. They keep the portable beach lounges stacked up and good luck finding an attendant who will offer to unstack and arrange a few for you. We did manage to attract the attention of the attendants when we sat for a few minutes, after lunch, on one of the many empty cabana lounges, in the grassy area outside the dolphin wing. An attendant quickly and curtly informed us that we could not sit here unless we rented it for the rest of the day. Ok, we suspected these had to be rented but weren't sure, and there was nowhere else to sit there, with the portables all stacked up. Did the attendant offer to unstack a few of the portables or to retrieve towels? No. So I unstacked several until I found some without bird droppings.

Returning to this property was like putting on a favorite sweater - it envelops you with familiarity and a warm comfortable feeling. The sense of pride and Hawaiiana culture is everywhere. This hotel is truly a classic which ages very well.The staff are particularly amazing. They all displayed a genuine warmth and helpfulness.We had an ocean view room with a lanai on the top floor of the tower. I don't think there is a bad view room on the property. I've stayed previously in a room with the scenic view and found the view of the nearby hills very soothing, and a room with the dolphin lanai puts you close to the action of the loveable dolphins.The room was very clean and well designed with his and her sink areas and closets in the bathroom. The décor not only gives you a sense of place, but is reminiscent of Old Hawaii (without seeming out of date).The breakfast buffet is amazing. Loved the waffles with coconut syrup. We dined in two of the restaurants in the evening. Their casual restaurant, Plumeria, was a bit of a disappointment. The menu offerings were not particularly tempting to either my husband or me. We felt the food we ordered was large in portion size and uninspired.Hoku's, however, was a different story. The menu choices were more interesting and the food was delicious. Our server went out of her way to make sure my husband's prime rib was cooked to his liking. A wonderful dining experience. One evening we tried a local bistro, 12th Avenue Grill, recommended by the concierge. Also excellent.The resort location on this peaceful stretch of beach in an upscale residential area cannot be beat. You are away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki but close enough to visit if you feel so inclined. The dolphins bring an added experiential dimension, whether you just watch their antics or participate in one of their hands on experiences with the dolphins.All in all a very relaxing stay.

Our stay there was absolute perfection.Our extended family took a vacation together at the Kahala, taking advantage of their ""stay 3 nights, get 4th free"" and the fantastic packages at Costco which include 2 complimentary breakfast buffets (which is about $70 for one person.)When we went to the bar one day (the restaurant was closed), we asked if they could make us root beer floats. After a beat the bartender said, ""I'm sure we can figure out a way."" They sent someone to who-knows-where to find the ingredients, and our entire family indulged.We also had a wonderful time looking at jewelry at Hildgund. The sales-lady was hilarious and so unpretentious. I believe her name was Teruko. My father ended up purchasing a lovely ring for my mother and gave it to her in front of the entire family. What a wonderful memory.Everyone on the staff goes above and beyond. When I asked if the embroidered laundry bags were available for sale, a staff member gave me one for free. One of my favorite amenities included with being a guest is a FREE PHOTO SHOOT with Pacific Dream Photography. What a great idea! I would have a photo shoot from every hotel I ever went to if it was offered to me. You are allowed one per room so we did an afternoon shoot and a sunset shoot. It was fun to have the different lighting. The photographers (we had 2 of them) were so patient and suggested lots of different locations on the grounds (of course EVERYWHERE is stunning) and ideas for fun poses we could do as a family. It was wonderful to check off ""Holiday card photo"" from my ""to do"" list as an added bonus!I also love that the pool/jacuzzi area are open 24 hours a day. EVERY pool in the world should be open those hours. We went swimming at 8pm one day and had the entire area to ourselves.And the food is AMAZING. My favorite place to eat was at THE TERRACE. The wagyu sliders were perfect and the haupia lumpia were amazing. My daughter also had a blast having her first formal tea service.Although I haven't mentioned it yet, the hotel rooms are also amazing.

There were screaming babies & children all around the pool, beach, in the hotel and parents yelling at them, which was quite stressful. We ended up cutting our 1 week stay down to 2 nights & left for another hotel.The service at the hotel was brilliant however & the manager was very understanding about our issue.It is also a lovely setting.I’m not so sure about the dolphins & tortoises in the pools there though, I feel that they needed more space than they have.","Leeds, United Kingdom","Carolinewyorks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",8,2.0

The hotel itself it about 20 minutes outside of the busy downtown area of Waikiki so if you want a peaceful trip and a gorgeous beach than this is your hotel! The room was very nice with a super comfy bed and a HUGE jack and jill bathroom which was a major plus. The separate room with a headed toilet seat was a nice touch in addition to the huge bath tub and shower. We had an ocean facing room in the ""Diamond Head"" wing but I would recommend asking for a room in the ""Koko Crater"" wing because the sunrise views over Koko Crater are AMAZING. Our room had an ocean view but was over the main parking area of the hotel so it wasn't directly on the beach. We didn't have a car but the parking fee is an additional cost. The staff was super friendly and we received a lay and cool towel upon check in. Every morning we received an ""aloha"" from maids in the hallway. This hotel caters to a more Japanese clientele and there was a wedding almost everyday we stayed there. The hotel is situated on the most perfect white sand beach with calm aqua waters which we swam in everyday. Unfortunately it was very windy when we stayed but that didn't stop us from sitting on the beach! We were almost the only ones sitting out there everyday. The pool is small so we didn't spend much time there but there were always an open chairs. It was so much fun walking past the dolphin lagoon every day and seeing them playing and swimming around, although I do feel bad that they are trapped in there. The breakfast buffet was expensive and left much to be desired so if you have a car grab food at Whole Foods nearby if you can. Their Italian restaurant on site was amazing though and highly recommend. The best part about this hotel is you are away from the crazy downtown area but can be there in about 20 minutes via Uber or their free shuttle which we used a couple of times to explore restaurants and nightlife. The only downside to staying here was that we didn't receive anything special for our honeymoon, no treats, chocolate or champagne. I think a little hospitality would have gone a long way but either way I would stay here again in a heartbeat!","Los Angeles, California","jamcc1986</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",8,5.0

We had 3 of our young grandkids with us .. and my kids. My husband and I had come 17 years ago and loved it so we wanted our family to experience it too. When we checked in they had leis for all of us cold towels and turtle stuffed animals for the kids. Their welcome was the best we have ever experienced .. We had a dolphin lagoon room and an ocean view room. It was wonderful sitting on our patio and watching the dolphins. Our grandkids were mesmerized, they came so close to our patio as they were swimming around the lagoon. The kids felt the dolphins were watching them and talking to them.There were so many family things to do .. We loved beach, for the kids the mild waves was just wonderful and they loved the kiddie pool with the tiled turtles. The grounds are beautiful and in the evening they are even more spectacular. We loved the breakfast included with our room ,, the Hawaiian french toast with the coconut syrup was divine. Our server was so cheerful and really nice to the kids. We always appreciate. The Buffet breakfast has so many choices and the bacon was some of the best I've ever had. All of the food was great ... I also want to comment on the staff. The entire staff was amazing from Lynn who checked us in, to the guy helping us with lounge chairs and a small table for our stuff. They were just there with smiles and greeting us with Aloha. I can't wait until we can come again and maybe stay a little longer. One more thing to add about the value of our reservation. We booked a signature rate which included buffet breakfast daily and 100.00 resort credit... so that was a major extra value to counter act the price .. The kids were free.

Was given an upgrade to a Scene Lanai room since we booked through Virtuoso. The room itself is a bit outdated and starting to show wear and tear but clean and functional. Shuttle service to town is very convenient. The beach! Oh I can just lay on the beach lounger for days.Dining was a hit and miss. Room service on our 1st night was mediocre at best. However, we really enjoyed the daily buffet breakfast at the Plumeria Beach House. We also dined at the Italian restaurant on the property one night and had an awesome dinner.The only thing I feel lacking from this place is the service. Service was okay but nothing exceptional. Bell staff was almost non-existent. We were never asked if we needed help with our luggage or transportation arrangement. Front desk staff was polite but almost robotic.

Service remains excellent, from bell hop, front desk, housekeeping and the delightful Steve and Gene in the bar, nothing is ever too much trouble. Although understanding of their long association with Dolphin Quest, it is really no longer 'enjoyable' seeing dolphins used for tourist attractions and this should be something that the hotel considers in this day and age.

If you do decide to try this exquisite hotel, please make sure you try at least one of their in house restaurants and also spend time with the dolphins at the hotel's pond: truly memorable. Also I believe that for an extra charge you can ""swim and play with the dolphins"".One more thing: the location of the Kahala is on the ""other side"" of Diamond Point and this is a stunning advantage. It is located in a private high end neighborhood, the ONLY hotel in the area, next to a private golf course and NOT on Waikiki.

Only one person at the desk. Hotel rooms and public areas have seen better days. Furniture scratched and chipped in my room. Tiles in bathroom stained. Comfortable bed. Old carpet. Hotel probably had its high light back inthe 1970s. I paid about USD 450 per night for my room Juliette Linai. I do not see much correlation between room rate and room and service. The pool is definitely too small for the hotel. Lots of children, very noisy. The beach is public. Hotel provides towel and lounge chair but no umbrella for shade. A cabana or anything that provides shade starts at US$68 per day, even if you only want to stay at the beach for only two hours. Beach was okay. Nothing special at all. Hokus was good but tasting menu was not exceptional. Lamb was overcooked and had to send back! Fish was iver cooked, fry as well. Appetizers were very good. Staff is used to guests who have not travelled extensively and/or dined around the world in 2 and 3 Michelin star restaurants or Relais Chateaux. Breakfast is busy and noisy. Buffet only and no a la carte. Stand in line and wait. Bring headphones. Seaside grill is good. Service friendly but lacking in etikette. Although my reservation was made and confirmed with my title as Mrs. Everypiece of paper, even the welcome note in my room as an unlimited Leaders Club Member was addressed to Mr. The General Manager Gerald Glennon blamed it on my travel agent or Leading Hotels although written confirmation contradicts this.

It was genuine and sincere. I also immediately noted they had been very busy making the hotel even more elegant and worthy of its global reputation. The new reception and boutiques area has been beautifully upgraded.For more than half a century, this bijou has been the retreat of visiting European and Middle Eastern Royals, Presidents, Prime Ministers and global music and screen stars. I love walking past their lobby level photo gallery of famous guests who have graced the Kahala over the years. I now understand why the Kahala has also been a firm favorite with the local community who have always been embraced by the hotel owners and management and have contributed to the unique and friendly culture that permeates all areas of the resort. They can now add me to that community list. This beautiful ocean-front hotel, nestled in tropical gardens with it's unique dolphin ponds, is a place that visiting guests and the local residents alike truly treasure. To think the resort's very secure and tranquil environment, just 12 minutes from the bustle of Waikiki and 20 minutes from the Ala Moana Mall and downtown Honolulu, is what I imagine the hotel VIP guests perhaps value above all else - I certainly do.While the food at the ocean-front Plumeria Restaurant or at the sophisticated Hoku's is as good as it gets, my favorite place is the comfortable and welcoming Veranda at sunset.... until late at night. The live music; friendly and attentive service and the comfort and beauty of the decor ( the Venetian glass chandeliers are spectaular) make this a very special gathering place. I love it !Being a resort, and not just a luxury hotel, means there are a wealth of activities including surfing and stand-up paddle board classes; a luxury spa; a very well-appointed fitness center with the latest equipment;, coastal sailing and of course the very, very special activity of swimming with the dolphins. On this trip I used the gym, the spa and just soaked up the calm and sunshine from the lanai and lawn of my beach-front suite. The suite itself had those signature grand old decor , furnishing and fixtures and very much reminded me of the 'old' Raffles in Singapore, the Oriental in Delhi or the Penninsular in Hong Kong. Like all truly great hotels, I had a wonderful feeling of wellbeing and indulgence throughout my weekend stay.

Wonderful recommendations were made for lunch and the restaurant manager was approaching several tables asking how their food was and asked us, too.

Just laid back Hawaii with a touch of understated class. Staff is pleasant and helpful. On the not good side, it needs to have better pool situation. They are small and they need a decent adults only pool. The big drawback for us is no ice! No icemakers that guests can access. We needed ice for injury and other reasons. Had a difficult time getting it. Would never have assumed that at a first class resort. Asking staff is ok, but takes too long and obviously not a priority.

The customer service has been superb until our visit last week. Sooooo disappointing! Going from having a beyond outstanding experience to mediocre was not what we were expecting. This hotel always stood out because of its prestige and unique clientele, who catered to presidents, royalty, movie stars, etc. The service was exceptional and was nice because it was away from the busy Waikiki crowd. I'm not sure what's happening with management, but then we were there last week it was nothing like what we've experienced in the past. There were all elements of people (not to be discriminating), ton of kids, and the break point was when we were in the water, in front of the hotel, and a nice piece of human poop went floating by. Thank god the wind was blowing and it kept going towards the condo beach next door. Someone needs to get a hold of what the ""Kahala Resort"" used to be......the quality has really taken a turn for the worst. I believe it definitely has to do with management. The front desk was accommodating, the Valet were awesome, the service at the Plumeria was great, it was just the overall feeling of being on the property that left a bad taste in out mouths....no pun intended But when that piece of poop went floating by, that kinda told us that things have definitely changed.

There are so many choices in this area and I researched them all. This hotel has met all my requirements for the perfect family vacation spot:Beyond beautiful beach and scenery throughout hotel and grounds.Swimmable beach just steps away from our room, calm enough for blow ups for kids and it even has a floating platform for the older kids to venture out to. Really large beautiful rooms with enormous bathrooms (his and her side each with a closet, stand alone shower, separate tub, and potty room). Large deck off room with comfy chairs for watching the dolphins (we had 2 dolphin lanai rooms for our family with 2 adults and 4 kids).Calm and peaceful oasis. It does not feel crowded at all. It is everything you dream about when you think of Hawaii. Excellent concierge team. Communicated easily and often before arrival. They secured an all day ocean cabana ($165/day) and a private tour of Pearl Harbor for my son and husband. And of course all the activities we planned: shark cage diving for my teenagers (snorkel gear used and less expensive and easier than you would think, THANKS A LOT SHARK WEEK), dolphin swimming, Pearl Harbor tour, etc. how are we going to fit in Hanauma Bay snorkeling, hiking Diamond Head (both near Hotel), shopping in Waikiki, Chinatown food tour, haunted Honolulu tour my teen wanted, spa, Dole plantation, etc?Clearly, I should have planned much more time at this oasis in this really fun island. All my kids are asking why we have to leave after 2 days to go to Maui!Not sure about why there would be negative reviews. It is not sparkling new, but very classic and well maintained. And those fancy toilets were the cause of hours of giggling by my 7 year old daughter who is now the expert at all the functions. Only regret is not staying for a week or at the very least 5 days here. Final tip: booked our stay through Costco travel website. Better prices than any web deal or travel agent I spoke with, and it included a free car as well as free hotel valet parking.

We wanted to get away from the Waikiki buzz and selected this hotel to be at the beach and not too far away from Honololu. The architecture is beautiful, with an open air lobby, stylish and well decorated, indeed it has 2 big buildings with 10 levels and some lower level rooms around the dolphin laguna or at the beach front. The reception was efficient but not overly friendly. We were staying at an Ocean Front Lanai room (8th fl), spacious, nicely decorated but with wall to wall carpet that should not be there in a tropical environment (why not wooden floors for a 5 star hotel: healthier and more style). Must admit the bathroom, however not the latest design, was big and efficient for 2 people. The room had a great view on the ocean with a nicely spaced balcony. The breakfast area had an inside an luckilly also an outside terrace which was the area for evening dinners (Plumeria) aswell. The hotel was at full capacity so you had to wait for breakfast, but the way the breakfast buffet was organized did remember me of some 3 star level hotels where masses of people where looking for food, absolutely not the level of a top hotel (the teams however did their very best to serve you well !). The absolute disaster and reason for rating this hotel only with 3 stars was the beach service or rather the lack of organizing a clean well kept beach: in the early morning you would find beach chairs all over the place with sand and old towels still on from the day before. If you want some shade at the beach you will have to pay which is unforgivable at this resort price level, I would suggest for management to take a trip to Asia or beach clubs in Europe and copy the beach service. So all in all what a shame as the hotel has really potential, the staff are trying their upmost, it has maybe the best location in Oahu but is falling short on a number of important elements justifying its 5 star rating.","Brussels, Belgium","SLCBelgium</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brussels, Belgium</strong>",14,3.0

I will address each item separately: Lobby- Upon our arrival, we were very impressed on how nice the lobby was. It was clean, and it became quickly apparent that this truly was a 5 star hotel. Front Desk Staff- After an 11 hour flight from New Jersey, it was great to have courteous and friendly staff to greet us upon our arrival. Breakfast- The buffet breakfast in the morning had plenty of options and it was delicious. Upon our arrival, we were advised that the busiest times in the breakfast room are between 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., so it would be ideal to arrive for breakfast prior to those hours. But being that our body-clocks were still on New Jersey time, arriving early for breakfast was not a problem. Beach- The beach at the Kahala was amazing and very calm, and because it is secluded it lacked the crowds. We were concerned of high waves because we went with two young children, but there were practically no waves at the Kahala. I was informed that due to the reef in the ocean where the Kahala is located, it prevents the waves from getting to be too high, thus the beach is perfectly safe for young children. Cabanas- Also while at the beach, we had reserved a cabana every day for a fee of $65 per day. It was well worth it so we could get a slight break from the hot sun when we wanted to rest for a bit. Lunch- We had lunch everyday at the Seaside Grill, which is right on the beach. The hamburgers and sandwiches were nice and tasty portions, and the coconut smoothies were spot-on.Dolphins- We were especially excited to have a session with the dolphins at Dolphin Quest, which is in the vicinity of pool at the Kahala. It cost $225 per person for a 30 minute session, and we will have great memories, photos, and videos of playing with the dolphins. Dinners- Most of our dinners were outside of the resort area, but we did have some dinners at the Kahala. We had dined at Arancino’s for nice Italian cuisine. We had also dined once at the Veranda, and the most memorable part of the meal was a non-alcoholic drink called a Kahala Fruit Crush; it was an all-natural mix of various fruits into one drink. So even if you do not dine at the Veranda, I recommend that you at least order the Kahala Fruit Crush. Pacific Photography- We had used the services of the photographers who are stationed inside the Kahala. They did a fantastic job, and they knew all of the best spots on the beach to take photos, along with having us properly pose for the camera. Day Tour thru concierge- We took a break from the beach for one day based on the recommendation from the concierge to do a one day tour around Oahu. The stops on the tour included a coffee farm (where we bought various flavored coffees), the Dole Plantation, a macademia nut farm, the North Shore, and the Polynesian Cultural Center. This tour was fun, and the kids mostly enjoyed it due to the plentiful gift shops that we patronized. Room- The room was clean, and it was on the larger side compared to other hotels in which we had accomodations in the past. This was especially important here because we had brought more luggage for Hawaii than we had brought for other destinations because this vacation was for more days than our usual annual vacation. So even though we had four check-in luggage, four carry-ons, and multiple personal items, we still had plenty space to comfortably walk around our room.The bathroom was especially large, as it had two sinks (each at the opposite side of the bathroom), a large bath tub, and a separate shower. The toilet had its own separate room within the bathroom itself. The toilet was quite unique as it had a heated seat. Wall of Fame- On the ground floor near the lobby, there is the Wall of Fame which has photos of past and present celebrities and dignitaries who had visited the Kahala. Location- The Kahala is far enough from the crowds that it is quiet and secluded, yet it is only a 20 minute cab ride or shuttle ride away from the big-city feel of the Waikiki beach area. We especially enjoyed the coziness of Kahala, yet we did plenty of shopping and browsing at the stores of Waikiki.","Trenton, New Jersey","JohnZfromJersey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trenton, New Jersey</strong>",11,5.0

He then called me by name (it's a tough one to remember) for the next few days I was there.Lastly... if I was not impressed enough by how great this hotel looked and it's killer location...I had a surprise at check-out that I was most impressed with (I am an experienced luxury travel and not easily impressed) When I checked out last Sunday, the hotel's manager came out to greet me!!

There are several things going for them, for sure. It is in one of the fanciest neighborhood, Kahala. The ground sits on a very nice property with a beautiful private beach. They have the ""dolphin quest"" where you can play with six dolphins (on the other hand, the six dolphins cohabit in rather small lake... it looks pretty big in the pictures, but they are rather small). The pools are fun. You would see a ray (or two) and other tropical fish in their pond, the water fall is impressive. The hotel is certainly prestigious in terms of the kind of guests who've stayed at the hotel (you can see the pictures hung on hallway -- pictures of kings, queens, former presidents, emperors, hollywood stars, grammy awards winners, etc etc). And, the price of the hotel certainly will convince you that it is a luxury hotel. The hotel staff is very courteous and friendly. At the check-in, they give all the female guests orchid leis and male guests Kukui nut leis. That certainly made my father happy, and the cool orchid lei was very refreshing against my skin after the 7-hour flight!! Since we checked in a little early, she told me that we can use the hospitality suite where we can shower, take a quick nap, have tea/coffee, or just relax. Right before 3pm (the check-in time), I received a call from one of the receptionist and was informed that the room was ready.So, we got the keys, get to the room, and as soon as we walked in, we were hit with the old urinal smell. Yes... the whole room smells like an old bathroom. Not sure what that was about. I went to the bathroom, and I couldn't really locate the smell. The bathroom is huge, with two vanity, two closets, which was nice... except that one of the sinks doesn't drain the water... Maybe they have some pipe/drain issue? Anyways, we had to open the windows for a couple of hours to get the smell out of the room (but bathroom just stank). Since we were only staying one night, we didn't even bother telling the house keeping to fix the sink. But, the whole entire bathroom has a dated look. Most of the tiles in the bathrooms have cracks in them. Maybe they are going for an antique look? Not sure. Didn't really give off a pristine feel, unfortunately.As some of the perks of staying at the hotel, there are a lot of activities going on the resort, and you can probably spend a whole entire week on the resort (though they don't have that enough restaurants to keep my interest). One of the perks was getting a 45-minute photo shoot on site for free, and that was a lot of fun. Anyways, I felt like the hotel was overpriced for the amenities and quality of the room, and I don't think I will be staying there again. On the other hand, Hoku's has the best Sunday brunch in Honolulu, and that was one of the major reasons we stayed over Saturday night... so I am giving it a 3 star.","Tempe, Arizona","Masumi I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tempe, Arizona</strong>",11,3.0

This resort has a beautiful little beach that feels private (all beachfront in Hawaii is public by law), and it has first class service and employees. The restaurants are of high quality with very very good food and service. Location is great -- close to the city but not in the city itself so a quick jaunt to shopping and other sites is easy.What is the problem? Well... The pool for the hotel consists of a small kids pool and a regular pool and hottub. In practice all three were one big kiddy pool -- there is no separation of adults and kids, so you can be in the hottub and a parent brings their baby in diapers and plops them down next to you. Gross. The main pool was overrun with small kids as well. If you have kids with you -- great, you will love the access. If you are like me and my wife, there for a romantic getaway we retreated to the beach and avoided the pool deck which also meant no beachside food service either. This is a problem that the Four Seasons has sorted out by building separate calm adult pool decks at their resorts and I must say was the one thing that irked us at an otherwise wonderful stay.Overall this is a great hotel with many unique features -- location, quality, service, dolphin attraction, great beach, and friendly staff, but there is one downside in their design. We do plan to come back and stay with them again.","New York City, New York","Michael F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",6,5.0

We were so excited about this stay and it's really upsetting to write this review. Almost everything about the resort - beach, service, restaurants, common areas, gardens - is absolutely impeccable, seriously amazing and more than met our expectations.What didn't though, was the rooms. Honestly, I was shocked at the state of our Dolphin Lanai room, which was one of the more expensive options in terms of rooms. It was a big room, with 2 of the smallest beds I've ever seen. It's the first time in any of our travels that my husband and I couldn't sleep in the same bed - we had to share with a child each! They were TINY, and really uncomfortable. So much so that none of us really slept for the week. I should have complained but didn't because really, what were the options? I'm assuming all the beds are the same throughout the hotel. So instead of coming home rested and relaxed, we were all completely exhausted and cranky.We'd previously had a week at the Moana Surfrider with twin beds which was beautifully comfortable and honestly I was expecting at least the same at The Kahala.Aside from the terrible beds, the room was really rundown. Very old carpet, furniture and paint. The bathroom was awful - so old and tired, dodgy patchy paint, crumbling cabinetry, tiny little old drawers. Tiny old shower with a crusty shower head and mildew in the grout.We had to unplug the toto toilet, as the seat was burning hot and every time someone walked into the bathroom it turned itself on even when not in use. Annoying, and not very environmentally friendly!Honestly, I was pretty devastated. This hotel has just so much potential but the rooms are really in desperate need of complete renovation. Not just a refresh - I mean a complete gutting and re-doing.The room with taxes etc was around $850USD a night - well over $1,000 AUD a night which is an enormous amount of money. For that, there is an expectation that the entire experience is luxurious and amazing. The resort itself hits this mark but the rooms absolutely do not, and so because of that i don't feel that the experience is able to be recommended.If they fixed it, I'd be back in a heartbeat. Until they do though, I couldn't recommend staying here.","Byron Bay, Australia","mrsaAustralia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Byron Bay, Australia</strong>",15,2.0

Great hotel. I'd never stayed before, but remember the place from a visit I made when my aunt and uncle were guests around 1970. It was the Kahala Hilton then, and considered top notch, as it is today. The dolphins are still there and you can meet them up close. I've heard it's the oldest such habitat in the country. Check me on that. We had parking and breakfast included in our package, no small sum. Plus a room upgrade to full ocean view from a very spacious balcony. You may not get all these throw-ins (my gf is a regular) but you will likely love your stay.It's right on the beach. Yes, palm trees, trade winds, sounds of crashing waves all await. It's also near the Kahala mall, so if you like to shop or simply forgot something, things are easy. Try the little gastropub Puka's in the Whole Foods. Great beers and food. Really liked that place.The structure of the hotel itself goes back to something like 1964, but they've been sprucing things up and keeping modern. The reception area and lounge are very open, spacious, and inviting. The new finishes are quality and elegant. This does not look like a ""faded glory"" hotel as I have seen elsewhere many times. We didn't have a suite, but the room too was spacious. Bathroom serves a traveling couple well. Dual sinks and storage areas. Shower and bath were separate, facilitating his-and-hers getting ready for an evening out or at the on-property Hoku's restaurant (I'll review separately). The closet areas in the bathroom space seemed a bit odd to me, but ultimately served our needs. There weren't accessible outlets near the bed, so, horrors, we had to charge up our E gadgets from batteries which we recharged in the bathroom the next day. The bathroom included a Toto ""Washlet"", a halfhearted bolt-on attempt at mimicking the company's high end bottom-cleansing toilets. The heated seat was absurd in Hawaii and the built in ""deodorizing"" fan merely filled the little room around the toilet with a vague sewer smell. With the hoses and wires coming out the side it looked more Soviet than Japanese.The bed and linens are great, super soft and comfortable. The service in our room was good, but getting ice took longer than I'd have liked. I wish they just had an ice machine like a motel 6. The bell and valet staff were great. Very friendly and fast. The desk folks were also very good. Look for Pete out by the pool / beach, a cool and capable guy. Very nice fellow. He'll teach you SUP, or in our case outrigger canoe paddling / surf riding. Look for the turtles, we saw several. Actually caught a few waves! They also do little catamaran trips. Don't forget to meet the dolphins. An adjoining pond has cool looking fish and a very social stingray. Pool is not huge, and populated with kids, but is nice. Ditto jacuzzi.We had breakfast in Plumeria (main casual restaurant) each morning. Omelet bar was very good. Smoked salmon and the trimmings also very good. Fruit was pretty tasteless, but looked good. Coffee and juices were decent. All the usual buffet stuff. The service was quite good, and friendly. We sat at the bar, a great way to avoid the big line, giving us a nice view of the pool and beach environs. Also had a lunch there. The poke crostini was especially good. The evening bar menu out on the veranda was also very tasty. All in all this is a very nice hotel and you should definitely give it a try.",,miken806,36,4.0

Instead of improving the infrastructure of the hotel, there are exposed wires everywhere...tv...lamps...etc. Furniture is beaten up and the general condition of the room is pretty pathetic...and this is an $1,100 per night room. I've loved this hotel for almost 40 years, but this experience is pathetic and sad. Even the general cleanliness and attention to detail has gone downhill.

It has many advantages over the throngs of hotels located on Wikiki Beach in Honolulu, crowds and the hustle and bustle being the chief among them. The Kahala is located in a residential area, about 20 minutes drive from downtown Honolulu. However, it's not isolated by any means, and plentiful shopping and dining options are only minutes away.The main reason I couldn't give this resort full 5 stars is that it's showing its age and is in need of some remodeling, particularly in the guest rooms.Pros:- Located right on a smallish but very nice beach away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu Waikiki Beach; feels much less like a tourist trap than parts of Honolulu- Adjacent to a nice golf course- Dolphin lagoon with several dolphins, turtles, fish, and other sea creatures (kids can participate in Dolphin Quest at additional charge)- Accommodating, attentive, and friendly service- Very kid friendly- Timely and reliable housekeeping with turndown service (with complimentary water and chocolates)- Very large rooms with all of the amenities- Clean and well maintained facilities- Friendly and helpful staff (everyone, from valets to front desk to housekeeping to maintenance)Cons:- Very odd room layout. Difficult to describe, but if you've been to Kahala, you know what I'm talking about. The bathroom is large, but it's almost as if they took two small bathrooms (one with a tub and one with a shower) and mashed them together. So even though the bathroom is actually quite large, it feels cramped. Also, the TV is mounted on a side wall next to the bathroom, so that if the bathroom door is open, the TV is obstructed from view. This very weird room design will have you scratching your head, literally -- my son actually hit his head on the TV!- Rooms and facilities are clean but definitely showing their age; it's overdue for a refresh and remodel (particularly the guest rooms)- Tiny pool (but not a huge issue considering its location RIGHT on the beach)- Somewhat loud A/C unit may bother some at nightOverall, the Kahala Hotel is a nice resort with excellent staff, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it or to make a return stay the next time we visit Oahu.

My husband and I chose the hotel for its proximity to Waikiki without actually being in Waikiki and on that front, the Kahala delivered. It is quieter and much less crowded than the Waikiki resort scene. The beach is very sandy and the water is beautiful and clear. In many other ways, however, the hotel came up short:1) Room quality: the hotel calls itself a 5 star hotel, but the rooms look more like a 3 star hotel--this was clearly a very nice hotel...25 years ago! The bathroom was dated, with a tiny shower stall, old fixtures, musty closet/cabinets, and mildew on the tiles. The layout was funky, with the bar set up in the bathroom (psychologically, I really did not feel that making coffee in the bathroom was at all appealing). The main update that seems to have occurred in the last 20 years is the installation of the Toto washlet in every room, which I will admit, was quite nice. While spacious, the room itself has dated furniture and the carpet is old. There was no bed skirt or sheet on the box spring of the bed. On the bright side, the housekeeping team does a great job keeping the rooms and common spaces looking mostly clean. Turndown service was very good. Overall, pretty underwhelming, considering we paid over $500/night for our (non-ocean view) room. We did face the golf course, which was actually very pleasant. 2) Restaurants: Given that we were hoping to be beach bums at the resort, we spent a lot of time at the hotel restaurants. A couple frustrations--a) the Plumeria Beach House restaurant, which is the main casual dining restaurant on the property, was always full, causing us to wait on three occasions. The recommendation of the hostess staff? Call to make a reservation. Sorry, but at a ""5 star hotel"", I feel that I shouldn't have to plan in advance to eat at the breakfast buffet. Also, after charging almost $40/pp, the hotel should consider adding another server at omelet station--that line is ridiculous. Again, service was friendly (and the omelets are good!), but all the waiting drove us nuts. b) Hoku's--we made a reservation for dinner at the ""fancy"" restaurant at the resort and ordered the degustation menu. We should have known it was going to be a bit lacking, but wow, that was a terrible value ($500 for weirdly huge portions, weird wine pairings, and frankly food that wasn't great). Yikes. Service was very kind, however. We had the Sunday brunch at Hoku's and enjoyed that much more. Arancino's, the Italian restaurant, was...fine. Cocktails at the pool were lacking and food was average (but I had a smoothie one day that was really good). I know we were at a resort, but given how hard it is to get off property, it would have been nice if the food was a couple notches better (I know it can be done! Even at a resort!)3) Pool/Beach: There is a small but very nice beach area and 4/5 days we were there, the pool staff could not put up umbrellas due to high winds. We were told that they were going to upgrade their umbrella system, but we ended up paying $115/day (+ tax and tip) for a cabana. There was a cheaper option for shade (a $60 beach shade for two chairs), but man, to pay for shade every day at the beach was a real bummer. We could have cowered under a tree, but any shady areas were very crowded. The vibe at the pool was your usual kids-shrieking-loudly situation. And the kids pool is tiny (and therefore, unused by children), so if you are looking for a relaxing pool environment, head elsewhere!4) Other odds and ends: The tv screens on the gym cardio equipment are nice, but the headphones didn't work half the time. There weren't enough outlets in the room to charge our phones. The sundry store didn't have basic necessities. Bottom line, the service was very good, but this hotel needs quite a bit of work to justify its high prices.","Bay Area, CA","sunshinelover33</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bay Area, CA</strong>",61,3.0

During my research I realized the oceanview room I had booked didn't have a balcony. What a waste of an oceanview room! It was my mistake but every hotel I've been to so far in Hawaii has a balcony when the room is oceanview. I called the hotel to get a different room but they said I needed to check with the company I booked with. I called BookIt and they didn't have any rooms with a balcony or ""lanai"" so I thought I would just ask for it during check-in. Luckily they had a room for me and were able to upgrade me for a fee. I stayed at the Grand Wilea in Maui just a few months ago so needless to say this hotel just doesn't compare. There isn't that ""wow"" factor when you first walk in. The pool is small. The rooms are nice but you can tell some things are getting old and dingy. I didn't rent a car because I expected to mostly stay at the hotel and they do have a free shuttle which is a plus but take the shuttle at your own risk. I actually called to confirm the location of pickup only to be completely ditched. And when I called to find out where the shuttle was they said it had already left. They told me to call a cab and they would reimburse me. I asked them if I could take Lyft because I've never rode a cab and already had the Lyft app on my phone. They said no because they needed a receipt to reimburse me. They even went so far as to ask me why I didn't flag down the shuttle when I saw it. The shuttle drop off is on the opposite side of where they told me to wait so they were basically asking me why I didn't run across three lanes of traffic to flag down the shuttle? This isn't the kind of service you'd expect for the prices you pay. I wouldn't say I would never come back here because the location can't be beat and most of the people here are wonderful but I wouldn't recommend this hotel based on my experiences so far.","Portland, Oregon","PonC29</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",3,2.0

My now adult son and I just returned from a 5-day visit that will likely be my last (I turn 86 on my next birthday). The hotel remains a gorgeous property and has aged well.

This was our third time spent at this hotel. It was USA school vacation time and I expected it to be crowded and it was but the holiday makers consisting mainly of families and honeymoon couples... a strange combination which worked really well as most guests were very polite and the children well behaved unlike our previous weeks visit to Maui 4 Seasons. The staff are very accomodating, the rooms well appointed and the house keeper Ping very meticulous and generous with bottled water and lovely products. The beach is perfect for toddlers , children and me as there are no waves due to a protective reef. The beach staff were the biggest let down at this hotel. We asked a passing server if he could bring us some water and we were told to get it ourselves which was no problem but could have been handled with more care. No umbrellas were available and covered chairs are available for over$ 100 + . No food or drink service offered to us the entire 7 days spent on the beach. The pools are very popular and fairly noisy probably due to the season but fine if you are with children. Not for adults wanting a peaceful time. The beach is a perfect alternative with lots of seating available . Breakfast buffet is fabulous with a great selection all labelled for food allergies and GF available for me . Chris the server was very efficient, friendly and helpful at all times. It can be very busy as outside visitors are welcome on the weekend but they do try seat hotel guests as priority. We ate at the Italian restaurant which has amazing food, beautifully presented. There is a very efficient shuttle service to the various shopping malls and the concierge staff Damien and DeeDee gave us some great suggestions regarding restaurants and amazing sushi at Sushi ii . There are weddings most days but they are very unobtrusive. We did have issues with some rather badly behaved and inconsiderate guests but it was dealt with after a few complaints.

I write a review after each trip there--I think this was our fourth trip--and to be honest I am beginning to run out of new ways to describe how much I love this place. Beautiful rooms. Great views. Good food (but see below). Impeccable service. Luxury.We had a rental car as part of our Costco package and one day drove to Waikiki Beach, just to see what we were NOT choosing, and all I can say is that we have no desire to stay at any of the 5 star hotels downtown. It was like one giant concrete high-rise after another, hot and crowded.The only real criticism we have for Kahala revolve around the food options. Veranda has gotten too fancy; you don't even see a Kahala burger or regular dinner items on the menu. Their jumbo shrimp cocktail consists of exactly two shrimp. Really. Just two shrimp. I am sorry, but you should not call two shrimp a cocktail. They were superbly fresh and delicious, but for $16 it was almost funny.Also, the regular Plumeria dinner menu needs more options for non-fish eaters. I recognize that with so many Asian customers it is probably tough to come up with a menu that pleases everybody, but there were times when I really just wanted a big steak and my wife wanted a Kahala burger. More pasta dishes would be appreciated, too, by people like my wife who want neither fish nor a steak.I will say that their seafood buffet has really improved since I tried it a couple years ago. At $60 it wasn't cheap, but I thought it was worth it if you like that kind of thing on a Saturday night. But I also have to mention that the next night we went to the Father's Day buffet. The buffet was virtually identical to the seafood buffet with three exceptions: 1) it was 15 bucks more per person, 2) there was a guy playing guitar and singing, and 3) there was a whole cooked pig. The buffet was not described to us as a seafood buffet when we reserved seating, so that was a big disappointment for my wife, who does not eat seafood. By the way, the pig made virtually no sense: it was cold and served in bite-sized portions rather than in piles of pulled pork, which is what you expect when you are in Hawaii and somebody cooked a whole pig. I wonder what they did with all that leftover pork, too, since diners seemed to be turned off by, well, a cooked pig head in the middle of a buffet. Anyway, it was hard not to feel a bit taken advantage of when we realized we were basically looking at the same seafood buffet.But all of these are small points. We love the Kahala and I am already thinking of our next trip there.","Medford, Oregon","John N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Medford, Oregon</strong>",23,5.0

The rooms were spotless and aesthetically decorated. The view from the Lanai(porch) was breathtaking. The bathrooms had luxury bath products. They had a shower and a soak tub and a vanity area as well. The evening turndown service was really cute, where they would leave chocolates every night.

Restaurants:The hotel has few of the best food places in Oahu. Plumeria is amazing for breakfast and dinner. The view of the beach right in front of you is beautiful! The Seaside Grill is good for drinks on the beach or by the pool. Arancino is phenomenal! So much creativity and so good food. Not to be missed! Valet & Parking:There is a $32 charge for Valet or self parking. The Valet people are super sweet and always very very responsive. There was no other resort charges and you always had water, towels, umbrella etc at your disposal from the Bell desk.They even have a shuttle which drops you at the most popular places like the Kahala mall, T Galleria, Ala Moana etc. Overall:Everyone was so nice and welcoming. 7 nights were not sufficient for me. I wanted to stay more. If you seriously want to enjoy the beach side and have a relaxed stay, this is the place you should consider. It is away from the Waikiki crowds and pretty accessible by Shuttle. We had a rental but we din't drive to this crowd . The best part of the hotel I would say are the people.

We had a huge room with plenty of room for the kids to run around, a gigantic bathroom with a tub and a shower, and a mini fridge that was blessedly empty so we could fill it with our milk and leftovers. We asked for a kama'aina rate and were told that we'd have a golf course view, but in fact, we had a great view of the ocean. We also told the staff we're celebrating our anniversary, and they had a bottle of champagne waiting for us - classy!Best of all, we LOVE THE POOL AND BEACH. It is kid heaven!!! The pool is heated to a very comfortably warm temperature. My toddlers loved the mini kiddie pool, just their size and just right for them. The beach has no waves and is ideal for children. My kids also loved watching the dolphins, turtles, and sting ray swim around, and visiting the waterfall.We had several great poolside meals - my only complaint being the portions were rather small for the high price tag.

I wanted a luxury hotel that was quiet, not crowded since I would be traveling with a toddler. The room and bathroom were spacious and very comfortable and the style of desk, size/location was perfect. The first two days were problematic. My luggage was delayed upon arrival but delivered to the hotel around midnight. However, neither the front desk nor the bellman called to inform me of such. While trapped in my room, I was surprised to hear the sound of construction above me (somehow I missed that the hotel is under renovation). As a result of the lack of communication from the staff, my luggage went undelivered until after 12pm. On day two, I ordered lunch (pepperoni pizza) for my daughter and received a pizza with a bread tie under the cheese and pepperoni. Definitely a quality control issue. However, the trip did improve greatly. The beach is beautiful, the waves are calm and perfect for little ones. Breakfast was consistently delicious. Room service was great (even at midnight). And the housekeeping staff of Jasmine and Belle provided impeccable service. My daughter enjoyed the large pool even in the rain. As well as, her wee dolphin encounter. However, while in the pool I noticed some unsafe tiles along the edges. Although, the resort has a small pool for little ones, the food menus only have children's meals for 6-12 yr olds. It would be nice to have a menu with smaller portions for those parents who are teaching our children not to be wasteful.Overall, I would definitely consider staying here again but only after the renovation is complete.","Rancho Palos Verdes, California","lisanbutterfly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rancho Palos Verdes, California</strong>",2,4.0

While we were there a team from the University of Michigan conducted a program of scientific research on the dolphins which would be difficult to perform in the wild and adds to our knowledge about dolphins, however captive dolphins are becoming increasingly controversial.

The large screen TV had execellent reception and the free wifi was reliable and of adequate speed.We relied on the shuttle, The Bus, and walking, to visit the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbour, climbing to the top of Diamond Head, hiking to Makapu'u Lighthouse, snorkelling at Hanauma Bay, circumnavigating the island by bus (for $2.50 each) and shopping in Waikiki and Honolulu also managed a swim at the crowded Waikiki Beach.The Kahala is in an upmarket area surrounded by beautiful homes and shares a boundary with the Waialae Country Club, a private golf club that hosts the Sony Open each year.A buffet breakfast was included in our hotel package and was served in the Plumeria Beach House with an uninterrupted view of the ocean.The breakfast staff were a delight and imparted much helpful local knowledge.

The hotels in Waikiki are perfectly fine, but few have direct beach access and none have the views or ambience of the Kahala.On the downside rooms particularly those on the Beachfront are not cheap and if I am completely honest are a little overpriced for the size and comfort.

Not great for surfers but wonderful for toddlers.*the breakfast buffet (included in my Amex rate) was excellent. The large numbers of Asian tourists have influenced a wonderful Asian food accent to hotel's offerings. In my group, we created a daily donburi option at breakfast from the rice, egg and proteins available each day. Delicious and fun.* the smallish pool (way overheated) was also perfect for kids. They alternated seamlessly between beach and pool.* beach walks in the early morning were outstanding for early risers, young and not so young.*international clientele (especially guests from Japan, China and Australia) lent a fun and sophisticated atmosphere to this destination resort.Minuses:* though great for kids, the pool was way too small, hot and crowded for adults. The resort badly needs a quiet, more luxurious pool option for adults.* the dolphin pond, though popular, is anachronistic. Caged dolphins performing for paying adults and families seems way out of step in today's world. I'd close that part of the pond in favor of a large adult pool mentioned above.* the food options are variable. The seafood buffet offered on Friday was disappointing. It had a catering, institutional feel and taste vs a fresh seafood option.* cabana facilities and services were minimal. At $115 per day, we expected a server to stop by once in awhile. Never happened during our 9-5 rental. Also, the cabana has a canvas cover and two lounges...only.

The stay back then was so great that my wife and I are going back this June 2017 (less than a month away), with the kids this time. i have no doubt that the service will be any less than perfect, like the last time we stayed. This time, I'm sure I'll be inspired to write a second visit review, but this time i'll do the trip advisor review 1st.Very sorry that I haven't posted this review sooner, it's been a couple of weeks since we got back and I've been catching up with all the work that I left behind, so this is my review for the Kahala Hotel and Resort. We stayed at the Kahala for three of the most relaxing days that I can remember. I wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday (milestone one), so I was looking for something that was close enough to be able to jet off too and fly back in a short amount of time and far enough to seem like a mini honeymoon without breaking the bank. So, I ask a friend of mine, who goes to Hawaii more than anyone I know, what was a fine Hotel with some style, great service, and some history (the wife likes older classy hotels), on Oahu? His response, ""The Kahala, its 10mins from downtown Waikiki, has its own private CLEAN beach, but's so nice you probably won't leave the resort"". Man was he right. From the moment, we arrived until the moment we left we witnessed and received the most attentive and hospitable service. I contacted the hotel through their website because I had a request, nothing big; I just wanted to surprise my wife with a handwritten card from me in the room before we arrived. I tried this the year before, for our anniversary at a really nice hotel (5star rating) and they dropped the ball. I won't mention the name of the place because they felt really bad and I know that sometimes things happen but I wanted to make sure I didn't have a repeat. The automated email I got was that someone would get back to me with-in 24 hours, lo and behold; someone responded 4 hours later, that someone was Chef Concierge Susan Koki. She told me that she would be more than happy to help with making this surprise trip one to remember, so she proceeded to ask about my wife, have favorite flowers, color, food, etc., she told me to send the card to the hotel and she would make sure that it would be in the room before we checked in, if anything came up to shoot her an email or text her. Now check in is at 3pm, which I didn't know, and we would be there at 1pm. This makes this even more special. So, Friday is upon us, wife has the day off and I took the day off, she has no idea what we are doing or where we are going. I take the kids to school, come home and tell her that she has 15 minutes to pack. Now this could all go bad fellas, you know how women can get, they'll pack 3 big suit cases for a weekend, the only clue I gave was to bring ID and the place has a pool. She thought we were going to Napa, imagine the surprise when we pulled up to the Airport then walk up to the Hawaiian airline gate and then pulling up to the Kahala. Now it's time for the icing on the cake. The valet/bellman greeted us, grabbed our ""two carry-ons"" and then let us know that our bags would be right up shortly and walked us to Linda at the front desk who checked us in, she then called Bart, who I believe was one of the hotel managers, who personally showed us to our room. Now remember those questions that Susan asked in the email? Well she paid attention. The HUGE room had Purple Orchids flowers throughout the room, on the dressers, tables, bathroom etc., chilled champagne and chocolate covered strawberries with the Kahala written in gold leaf, nice presentation, and on the bed surrounded by my wife's favorite flowers, my card... Touchdown!! I know that Mrs. Koki didn't just throw that room together in 20 minutes. Now guys this is where you get to see your better half cry the good crying, not the bad kind. ""The devil is in the details"" imagine getting to the room and your card wasn't there, my wife wouldn't have known but I would have and that would have killed it for me. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to find the Kahala and all of the wonderful people there, everyone we interacted with, working there, made every effort to make our short stay, dare I say perfect? The hotel is gorgeous and gets 5 stars itself but the service is on a whole other level. We will be bringing our children back here to vacation as there is plenty to do but I'll always remember our 1st experience here. If you don't want to leave anything to chance, I would recommend calling the Kahala. P.S. I never even spoke to Mrs. Koki over the phone or face to face (just email and text), it's almost like I had a guardian angel pulling strings for me.","Pleasanton, California","celiacarnes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pleasanton, California</strong>",1,5.0

Excellent service, huge room and great facilities. Private beach with a man made spit you can walk down, plenty of sunbeds serviced by sufficient staff levels. Nice big pool right next to the dolphin enclosure where we enjoyed a reasonably priced swim with dolphins experience. Good food by the poolside and in each of the restaurants (we tried all but the seafood one) although the Italian wasn't really up to much. Regular buses in to the local Mall or Waikiki which is a great night out for shopping, eating at Hard Rock Cafe (don't forget your ID as my 26 year old wife instinctively didn't think to take hers as we don't need it in the UK and she then couldn't get served alcohol). Of treat yourself at the Cheesecake Factory or enjoy the fireworks at the Hilton centre. Relaxing in the main bar with a drink and listening to the pianist was 1 of our favourite experiences at the hotel. The concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful, recommending the chiefs luahau which was amazing. All I would say is make sure you take enough spending money, we took £1500 for a week thinking we would be ok but it's around £7 for half a beer by the pool and £11 for a burger & chips for lunch. That gives you and idea of the prices you will pay throughout your stay in the hotel, admittedly it's cheaper if you venture out in to Waikiki but why pay for a 5 star hotel and not experience the catering there right?Overall the best holiday we've ever had and we will be back at some point in our lives.

And that's just what we got. It is located about 10-15 minutes away from Waikiki in a more quiet, residential area in its own enclave. We found that appealing to be away from the hustle and bustle. From the moment we arrived, the staff was the epitome of welcoming & friendly. They projected a genuine happiness of not only having us there but ensuring that we had an exceptional time. The front desk clerk who checked us in was extremely sincere in her efforts to upgrade our room in honor of our 10 year wedding anniversary. They were even gracious enough to send up a bottle of champagne on ice. -- classy move. We were greeted with beautiful leis and an adorable stuffed dolphin for our son. We booked this part of our trip through Costco who informed us regularly about ongoing construction throughout the property. Although this didn't sound too great at the outset, hotel management did an amazing job of containing any noise and related mess. In fact, it did not disrupt our stay in the least. We actually received 2 phone calls from of all people, the hotel operator who simply wanted to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and asked if there was anything they could do for us. Our room was on the 8th floor with a glorious sweeping head on ocean view. Very large lanai. Equally spacious bathroom with his & hers sides and finally a comfortably sized stall shower with good water pressure. (Separate large tub). I must mention that we have never encountered a hotel with bath towels as soft and plush as the Kahala's. There was also a keurig coffee maker with complimentary coffee pods provided daily. There were some issues though. The room itself needs work. The carpets are frayed and stained and the walls need a fresh coat of paint. There was a musty smell that we asked housekeeping to remedy. They tried to no avail. Also, the sheets almost felt damp. While it was humid, we certainly did not encounter that in Maui. But kudos to housekeeping who offered to change out the mattress. To be clear, notwithstanding these deficiencies, The Kahala is no dump. In fact, we believe they are far outweighed by the staff's exceptional service & care. We started each day with their incredible breakfast buffet. It exceeded our expectations. Lots of choices for kids and adults in a beautiful setting, overlooking the ocean. The saltwater pool was on the small side but never a challenge getting loungers with umbrellas. It was only steps to their self-contained beach where seating was equally easy. We enjoyed their towel policy, which was as simple as being asked, ""how many do you need?"" A welcome change from the hassle-filled and rigid policy at the Westin Maui. Kahala pool staff even insisted on escorting us to our choice of loungers and set them up with chair covers. The dolphin lagoon was a wonderful feature and we enjoyed seeing them. They offer a personal hands on experience in the water with them but we found it too pricey. We would be remiss by not mentioning the wonderful, highly skilled concierge staff. Special shout out to DeeDee, who was so friendly and knowledgeable and treated our 5 year old son like a prince. The Kahala is lucky to have her. Finally, it cost a lot to stay at The Kahala but it was worth every penny. But on that note, if you do book through Costco: it literally pays to check for pricing changes between your time of booking and departure. In our case, not only did the package price decrease by $357, they actually added comp breakfast buffet and parking. Costco refunded that difference immediately. If you happen to read my review of the Westin villas in Maui (same trip), you'll notice we wondered where their self-proclaimed aloha spirit was. We found it. It was here at The Kahala.

We would consider flying back just for this! We had it 3 times during our week long stay.The level of service at The Kahala - from the restaurant staff to the pool staff and housekeeping - all extremely friendly and attentive.

Note: the Hoku restaurant at dinner requires pants, no shorts. But the Veranda restaurant has smaller plates and luscious breezes with live music to entertain one and all. We remarked each morning how quiet this hotel was and how comfortable the bed was.

Reservation came with free breakfast buffet at Plumeria. Plumeria is being renovated so ate at Hoku's (free) during the week. Plumeria was open on the weekends. We had a second floor ocean view room with a Lanai. The second floor would be the third floor at other hotels. Nice view of ocean/beach from room 211. Stayed at Kahala in 2007 and 2012. I did notice that a bath tub shelf that was available in 2007 is no longer available.(see photo). Carpets do show a little wear from when they were first installed in 2007. I had a new room in 2007 when everything appeared to be new. very spacious room, with two bathroom areas, one with a shower one with a tub. I noticed that maybe to save energy, the corridors of hotel were not air conditioned. Air conditioning does shut off if balcony door is kept open. A new energy saving feature. Enjoyed cabana lounge and cabana tent rental for two days on beach. The grill near the beach serves a limited menu but still has the drink served inside a real pineapple. The front desk and housekeeping are very responsive. Valet service is quick and efficient. I have stayed at the Kahala 3 times and it was our honeymoon hotel in 2012 when we were given a free upgrade to a suite (which made our honeymoon even better). Hotel is near a residential area. It is a secluded hotel if you value quiet. Restaurants are in the hotel or within driving distance of the hotel. We used the spa which was very enjoyable. I used the fitness center several times. Modern equipment and open 24 hours. I did have problems using the room key several times to both get access to fitness center and room. It's one of those card keys where you touch the door to enter. Room has fridge, coffee maker and you also get free water and turn down service each night. Pricey of course at about $900 a night. but for our stay the 4th night was free again with the free buffet breakfast.

We are extremely happy that we stayed at Kahala Hotel and Resort! Highly recommend! I personally wanted something more resort/relaxing/quiet yet not to compromise my wife's opportunity to shop in Waikiki. Kahala is the place! It's less than 15 minutes away from Waikiki and Kahala provides a shuttle just about every hour. Other than the resort itself is beautiful with dolphins and it's semi-private beach, the food there is pretty amazing. My wife and I especially like the Italian restaurant Arancino inside the hotel. Try their uni pasta! Lastly, we wanted to maximize our day in Hawaii (who wouldn't) so I booked a 9:40pm flight back to LA. Through AMEX, we already have a late check out (4pm), so I thought I'll just ask to leave the bags with the hotel front desk like we normally do. However, Carlos, the front receptionist went above and beyond to better service us. He kept the room for us till 7:30pm instead so that we can enjoy our stay longer and be stress free with our luggage. That was Aloha-ly Awesome! Because of the extended hours given to us, we got to jump in the ocean and soak in some more Aloha sun!!! It totally made this trip that much better!

It was beautiful and relaxing. At the Kahala, you can be low-key or step it up a notch if you prefer. The staff is very helpful, welcoming and kind. Our boys 17 and 15 enjoyed the water, the beach and the gym. This is a great location as it is away from Waikiki, but just a 10 or 15 minutes drive away. We went to dinner three times in Waikiki and took Uber. We did have a rental car, but unless you are planning to drive to other parts of Oahu, I would recommend not having a rental car and taking Uber, much more relaxing and you don't have to deal with parking! We were advised that during the time we were staying at the Kahala, the Plumeria Restaurant would be under renovation. I did worry about this because that is where they normally serve breakfast. I need not have worried: Breakfast was switched to Hoku restaurant and worked very well. We did not hear any noise and were not inconvenienced at all. Would definitely come back to the Kahala again.

Out of ALL of our hotel stays during vacations, The Kahala is still our favorite. We love that it is tucked in a beautiful neighborhood, away from the hustle and bustle of the island. With two active boys, we opted for the oceanfront suite. It did not disappoint. There were so many great amenities, both in the room and throughout the resort. It was nice to come back to the room after busy days either sightseeing or lounging by the beach or pool and feel relaxed. My kids loved looking at the massive wall of celebrities who have stayed at the hotel. It made them feel ""fancy,"" as my nine year old put it...haha! I told him during our first stay, we saw the then Governor Schwarzenegger in 2008 at the front entrance. Chef Wayne and the entire food service staff was incredible--I contacted him a few weeks to our arrival and spoke with him about a week before we checked in. Our sons have a few food allergies, and we were never concerned or worried for their well-being, as Chef Wayne assured me they would be fine. At Plumeria for breakfast, items were labeled if they contained an allergen. While we dined at the various restaurants on site, they were already aware of the allergies and took extra care in ensuring that the boys would dine safely. Never did they feel short changed on food they were eating, as they were able to eat pretty much everything...except those items containing nuts. I cannot say enough about the on site photography that is offered at the hotel!!! This was not offered our last time at the hotel, which was about 9 years ago. So happy they have added this, as it's always nice to remember a vacation. Talk about quality photos using a GREAT camera-we took sunrise pictures and they turned out beautifully-some of my favorites-and we take professional pictures yearly. I purchased a package and we have all of the digital rights to them. Christmas pictures are DONE! Everyone there, from housekeeping, to the front desk, to the wait staff, to the bellmen--were so friendly and so helpful. The Kahala remains our favorite hotel, hands down.

We then spent the next few days overhearing ""Ferguson Rewards"" guests commenting on their free room upgrades. Kahala is in a beautiful setting and is simply wonderful, but it seems that their new owners have strategically decided to focus on larger group bookings.

When we checked in we realized that we needed a few items to accommodate my husband. Tyler at the front desk went out of his way to improvise and accommodate. It was much appreciated and worked well. Thank you. Everyone at the Kahala was ready, willing and aiming to please all of the guests. I've never seen so many ambitious and energetic employees. Nick at the pool was also amazing. Every day he would help my husband at the pool, never acting like it was a bother. The first few days of our trip the lift for the pool wasn't working to get my husband in the pool. We didn't say anything about it. A manager, Julie, came right over and took care of the situation. She reserved a cabana on the beach for us, champagne, and macadamia nuts to the room! We are not complainers, she just did this as a good faith gesture. I have nothing but good things to say about all of the employees at the Kahala. The view from our 9th floor ocean view lanai was breathtaking! It was wonderful to sit out there in the morning having coffee and again in the afternoon with a glass of wine. The room and the hotel were immaculate. Yes, the rooms are a little dated, but still very fresh and clean as were the linens. Room service was also great.The hotel is away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. My friend picked the hotel and the location was perfect. It is set on a cove perfect for swimming. We never had a problem getting chairs at the pool or at the beach. Staff members even came onto the beach and to the pool to ask if you would like lunch or drinks. We did order quite a few times and never had a problem with long waits. The lunch from Seaside Grill was very good. We also ate at the other two restaurants, Plumeria House and Hokus which were very good also.We also loved looking at the dolphins, sea turtles, and fish. The employees took very good care of them.

I cannot begin to describe the level of luxury and personalized attention that made this experience so unforgettable. We booked through Costco travel, so our flight, transfer to/from airport, and hotel were included in our pricing. We also had daily breakfast buffet, a spa credit, and a complimentary photo session. Altogether, this was an incredible value. I seriously cannot emphasize enough how lucky we felt to be at this resort. We had never been to Hawaii, so we were a little hesitant to be so far from Waikiki without transportation. There was no need to worry, because the complimentary shuttle from the Kahala to Waikiki stopped in several different areas and was very prompt and helpful. We also were able to easily schedule a few tours that picked us up at the Kahala.Honestly, though, I would be happy to not even leave the resort. The breakfast buffet was varied each day but always included fresh fruit, a personalized omelet station, and several baked goods. While the restaurant could be busy during peak times, we had no trouble finding seating, even the more desirable ocean-view tables. The grounds were immaculate, including the beach and pool areas. While we did not swim with the dolphins in the Lagoon, it was still a pretty cool sight to see. Our room was impeccable. It was a huge suite, with a king-sized bed, sitting area, flat-screen TV on a swivel, a HUGE lanai, and a bathroom with two separate sinks, a large soaking tub, and a walk-in shower. But overall, the most memorable part of the Kahala was the service. Anywhere we went, we were greeted with the warm Hawaiian hospitality that permeates the island. No request was too big and nothing was overlooked.

My family and I didn't want to leave!!!We traveled to Oahu in Nov 2016. Myself along with my husband and 4 year old son. We had never traveled to Hawaii with children before and were worried about our trip being too commercial and not ""Hawaii"" enough. We drove right to the Kahala from the airport and all the worries were gone. We are bit of hotel snobs and we paid a fair price for our stay but it is SO WORTH it. The Kahala is STUNNING!! It is quiet, away from Waikiki and on the other side of Diamond Head. It is a little bit of a drive to get to places, but the tranquility and peacefulness of the resort makes it incredible. They treated my son like a VIP and us as well. We had a Dolphin Lagoon room with an ocean view and it was sheer perfection. Every morning & evening we watched the dolphins and finally towards the end of the trip we did the Dolphin Encounter (via Dolphin Quest) and it was a very special moment for us. We are for animal preservation and the entire program is so incredibly respectful. The breakfast buffet the Kahala offers at Plumeria is so very delicious and a highlight for us daily. We bought the breakfast as part of our package and that saved us about $20 a day. The beach is lovely and was a must for us to book the resort. It completely met our needs and we were able to enjoy the beach daily. The food at the beach was also very, very good. Towels and loungers are always available. Be mindful- there are no umbrellas. Arancini for dinner was divine. We had a 3 hour dinner there with our son and they completely took care of us. Yes-it's pricey but we felt we had solid, delicious food. A few things that set this resort apart from others. The staff listens and tries to accommodate you. Several times, our room needed to be made earlier or later- no problems. Need anything like water or extra blankets or soap- it is delivered immediately. They really care to take care of you. We needed a late check out and were granted a 6PM checkout due to our flight schedule. If they can accommodate you- they will.

The pool is free but not very relaxing. My suggestion would be an adults only pool. The staff is to top notch. I MUST mention our all time favorite, Dean the Concierge. Dean was born to do his job. My husband and I absolutely loved him. In fact, maybe went too far by asking if he would come home and live with us??!! He is the most kind man and is so willing to help you with anything and everything. Always with a smile on his face. I would go so far to say that HE made us feel so welcomed and comfortable. And if his boss is reading this, HE DESERVES A RAISE!!! A couple of very small changes. Don't get me wrong. This place is near perfection. However, if they want to reach perfection it would be nice if the bathroom's had a ceiling fan. It gets quite warm in there doing hair, applying makeup, etc for the ladies. Also, the vanity has no drawers for makeup, etc And, last but not least, a small step in the shower for the gals to shave their legs.Now, my husband's MINOR complaints. He went to the workout room early every morning. He also loved the steam room. He said it would have been nice to have decent razors down there along with some more toiletries for the guys. Such as, after shave, etc. As I said, all MINOR things. We absolutely loved our trip. We went to recharge and have our trip of a lifetime and that was accomplished.

Now the one one bad note was that the food was expensive no matter what. We did manage a small dinner at the Italian restaurant but I didn't like that if you wanted to eat it was a big bite out of the budget.

The hotel grounds were always kept clean - it was very kid friendly. We got lessons how to paddle board from Peter and we also recommend that experience. This hotel has a great little protected cove that made learning the sport much easier. The balcony view of the ocean was to die for.

The staff of The Kahala really make you feel like royalty. Located off the beaten path of Waikiki The Kahala is a hidden gem on the island of Oahu. The rooms are spacious and elegantly clean. Every attention to detail has been considered for an optimal relaxation experience. Linens are soft and comforting. The soft comfortable beds embrace you for the best sleep that I've had on any vacation and the rooms are quiet as the Hotel is far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. I personally appreciate that in the evening, you can lightly hear the ocean waves washing up on the sand. The view of the Pacific Ocean is breath taking, and if you are lucky and are there at the right season you can see whales all the way out to the horizon. The white sand and beach is so fine to walk on barefoot. The water sparkles every morning and we were able to get amazing sunrises every morning of our stay. But what really made this experience over the top was the dining options. Though the breakfast buffet in the Plumeria Beach House is amazing with a large spread and made to order omelets, our real treat was Hoku's the fine dining restaurant. As you walk in staff greet you by name and you are seated at a table with a sunset view of the ocean. It was recommended by a friend that we try the 7 course Tasting Menu and I'm glad I did. If you like seafood Chef Wayne created a wonderful spread. I especially like the Petite Hamachi Poke Don, the Poached Half Lobster and Chef’s Signature “Kahala Wrap”. All flavors are fresh and well designed. The seafood is perfectly cooked and special care is taken to assure an optimal flavor and savory experience. Overall 5 stars is not enough to express the amazing weekend we had. Thank you Kahala. We'll be back soon.",,Mark R,0,5.0

It is a hidden gem. You really go through a time warp leaving the major city and congestion of the freeway from the airport to this magnificent oasis. It really transports you to a very relaxing self contained island in a residential neighborhood beyond Diamond Head. While this is an older property early 60's it is well kept and maintained. We use to go to the Mauna Kea a lot but that property of relatively the same vintage aside from its one of a kind beach is no longer well maintained, lacks the service, amenities, friendly and helpful staff and higher quality food and beverage offerings throughout the property. We also considered the Four Seasons Ko'Olina for this trip but have seen numerous poor reviews...its location and setting is nothing like the Kahala.Here is a list of the pro's (many) and con's (not many) Pro'slocationstaff-gets to know you quickly and your food choices, drink choices, your name, they go out of their way to be courteous and helpful and it is genuine (Mauna Kea staff could learn a lot from this group training and execution)cleanliness-rooms, public areas, restrooms...again even though this is an old hotel is is very well maintained...beautifully manicured groundsbeach-beautiful site with great places to sit, shade, umbrellas, nice lawn if you prefer that is well maintained, gorgeous views, good quality comfortable chaise lounges, with friendly helpful beach staff...you don't have to get up at 5:30 am to get a seat.fitness center-well equipped for this size property with a steam bathfood and beverage-Hoku, Beach front restaurant (lunch) and Arancino Restaurant on property were great variety, service, wine/beverage selections (though typical for many hotels wine is way overpriced...need to add more value choices in all categories on wine lists), the 3 meal restaurant (Plumeria) not so much...food was not great or the service, waitress provided indifferent poor service so in fairness we only visited it once. i.e. decided not to go back after a bad dinner but did not try lunch or breakfast while we were there. Veranda lobby lounge great for the evening with great live music, small plates and drinks/wine for before or after dinnerrooms-we stayed in an ocean view lanai room...great view, thoughtfully laid out with all you need and updated with 2 sinks, closets, great shower, etc. not all rooms here have lanai's or ocean views but its worth it.Pool scene-not a lot of screaming kids but perhaps we went at a quiet time and also fortunately not the hot shot look at me crowd that gets drunk and disorderly and unchecked these days at Four Seasons Hotel pools that we have experience first hand at several properties. There is a nice calm about the place.Con's things that could be improvedThough it would a major capital project it would be good to eliminate the dolphin pools and activity in the main courtyard of the hotel overlooking the beach...needs a bigger pool area and beachfront bars to take advantage of the incredible views...the one bar faces away from the ocean, you look at the bartenders from half a dozen stools versus out at the ocean. There is another bar across the way with a couple of outdoor sofas outside the 3 meal restaurant Plumeria that is a nice place to sit and sip with a view but the property could to a lot more to take advantage of their location with their bars.In summary, a great high quality experience from the reservation team that helped us a lot, every staff person we came in contact with..we have already booked again in November. Once you are there we just did not want to leave, i.e. no need to go downtown or even have a car...they have a shuttle service if you need it to downtown Honolulu.

I kept seeing many awesome reviews for the Kahala, but for the price and distance from Waikiki, I wasn't completely sold. Yet, when I found the Costco package (which I highly recommend!), I was more OK with booking. Since my week at the Kahala, I cannot recommend it more. It is such a beautiful hotel. The service was the most wonderful I have ever experienced. Everyone is so helpful, attentive, and nice! I loved the room's cleanliness and luxurious feel (I felt so spoiled! Chocolates and a plumeria nightly). It was so quiet and felt very safe. The breakfast at Plumeria House was phenomenal! The bed was so comfortable. And the distance to Waikiki wasn't an issue since they have a complimentary shuttle. I did a combo of driving and shuttling, but I like the shuttle because parking in Waikiki can be a bit of a struggle. I even liked being away from the hubbub of Waikiki (as many people will say). Overall, for what Kahala offers, I can't recommend it enough. I had a blast even without an ocean view room (views of Diamond Head and Koko Head were still awesome).

The hotel was nice enough to upgrade us to an oceanview lanai room upon arrival -- a beautiful view overlooking the pool and beach, but very quiet.

Highly recommend dining on the patio of Arancino, there is a casual vibe but the food and service is upscale. The beach is beautiful! Kahala does a great job of putting plenty of lounge chairs out on the sand, so unless you want the shade there is really no reason to hire a cabana (I am a big fan of cabanas and we do rent them at most resorts we go to- not necessary here). There are servers that walk around constantly if you'd like to order food and drink on the beach. Kids enjoyed swimming with the dolphins, and ordering smoothies at the pool bar.

For all of Waikiki's noise, shops, intensity and crowds the Kahala offers the complete opposite.The iconic 60s style modernist Kahala hotel is set on the most beautiful palm tree lined golden sand beach, with protected calm water surrounded by an outer reef. The beautiful hotel pool area is located next to the beach and there are free sun lounges for hotel guests in addition to enclosed luxury cabanas (for an additional hire fee). The beach waiter service is attentive, and there are activities offered such as stand up paddle boarding, kayaking, fishing and a dolphin experience (the Kahala features a natural looking large lagoon which accommodates approximately 4 dolphins). The overall mood is one of calm and privacy. The privacy obviously has appeal as this hotel has the reputation of being a celebrity favourite and there was a NYC celebrity with their entourage staying while we were there but they along with everyone around them were very discreet and low key. It's very easy to relax here.The hotel lobby and hotel interiors are impressive and grand and yet have still captured the charm of 'Hawaiian Island cool'. Our room which was a basic landside room without lanai overlooked the famous neighbouring golf course and the mountain, and was a generous size and luxuriously appointed. My husband and I were travelling with our teenage daughter and the room comfortably accommodated the 3 of us.This was our second visit to Oahu and our second stay at the Kahala. Previously we hadn't stayed in Waikiki, on this trip we spent 5 nights in Waikiki first followed by 8 nights at the Kahala. For me the Kahala is the ultimate Oahu holiday, whereas Waikiki was simply too noisy, too crowded and not at all relaxing. If you are looking for a bit of both experiences the Kahala offers a free shuttle bus to take guests to the local shopping centre Kahala Mall, the Ala Moana Shopping Centre and to central Waikiki though you need to book your seats in advance as it's popular.The only (small) negatives are the cost of hiring a cabana or covered sun-lounger is pretty pricy and should be greatly reduced for hotel guests (a few 'outsiders' appeared to be hiring them on the weekend yet it's the same hire price for non hotel guests), and there is quite a hefty additional fee for a rollaway bed and having a third person in the room which wasn't quoted initially in the room rate. We ate in the Plumeria restaurant and in the Arancini restaurant and both experiences were excellent. It would be nice if the beach bar could be opened a little later than 530pm as a glass of wine in the evening on the beach would have been an attractive option.This is an impressively run and excellent hotel set on a gorgeous beach. If you're after a relaxing yet luxurious resort style holiday then the Kahala would be a great choice.","Perth, Australia","Traveller6010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",36,5.0

This time we came upon The Kahala Hotel and Resort, and the journey was nothing less than amazing. Admittedly, I'm picky when it comes to hotels, air conditioning has to be cold and vents clean. I cherish the time passed tradition where it seems everybody from the bell desk to the managers seem to know you and go out of their way to make sure the traveling experience is nothing short of Mr. Rourke's character in ""Fantasy Island"" - let me tell you from Carlos the desk manager to Bob and team at the restaurant I know as Rick's Bar from Magnum P.I. (who turned me on to another tv idol of mine - - Jack Lor'ds bronze not too far from the hotel) made this experience and trip as close to Heaven On Earth as I can remember. The Kahala offered unparalleled personal service -- beautiful rooms with beach and ocean views, top notch room ""ambassadors"" and one of the greatest surprises of all - - the talents of a singer I met with a smooth soulful styling not unlike the finest in the music industry I've worked with - - his name is David Swanson and he tore up Lionel Richie's ""Easy Lover"" and simply, lives in a house of soul of his own making. Add-in the beach hut, and we made it Paradise yet again.

The bar was set very high! The Kahala is extraordinary and I would stay there again.The facility itself is stunning from the first view of the lobby to the huge lanai off our very large room. We were almost overwhelmed at first, but sitting at a table on the beach to each our lunch the first day there soon lulled any doubts we might have had about ""belonging"" here and we reveled in our week-long experience every moment.Our room was beautifully appointed with an incredibly comfortable king bed, separate sitting area, desk and massive sliding doors to the lanai. Every day our three rooms (bedroom, large dressing room and large bath) were tidied and we would find lovely bottles of water along with chocolates and orchids when the bed was readied for night.There was more than adequate information in our room about the resort and area, all very helpful. Also helpful was being able to text the concierge with any questions.We had a rental car but never had the opportunity to park in the garage ourselves. This was somewhat odd to us and valet service, even at a few dollars each time for retrieving and returning the car, became a bit of an exasperation. While convenient and easy, we could see that the open air garage was not full, even when the discretely placed sign said it was. However, the valets were all extremely accommodating and always made sure we had a Kahala shopping bag and cold bottles of water when sending us on our way.Being only minutes away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki was a huge plus. And yes, the shops, restaurant and famous beach were only a few minutes drive away. We ate not only at the beachside restaurant, but also on the veranda. A lovely glass of wine, excellent light meals and very good service await. There are restaurants on the premises for larger meals and also afternoon tea in the lobby, but we did not partake. I took issue with the dolphin lagoon. While lovely, it was very hard to see these gorgeous creatures in captivity, even though they appeared to be well cared for under excellent supervision. I wish the hotel management would reconsider and allow the dolphins the life they deserve....one of freedom.The views are amazing, the staff professional, friendly and courteous, but the resort is expensive; not just for the room, but the shops, full of enticing items, are also quite pricey. However, this is what one would expect while staying at such a beautiful hotel.We would definitely stay at The Kahala again, but would be better prepared for the luxurious surrounding with expensive meals and extra items. This is no fault of the resort that we did not adequately prepare ourselves for such a stay.","Scarborough, Maine","678elizabet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scarborough, Maine</strong>",8,5.0

We have had the breakfast here 2 days now ordered from the menu the Lobster Benedict was yummy and the Turkey Tostada was also yummy.I never usually enjoy the food at hotel restaurants but thus far I have been pleasantly surprised at the quality and service. The only drawback staying at the Kahala is that it is a remote location from Honolulu. The hotel does provide a shuttle service but it does put you on a schedule which for many of us on vacation we are trying to get away from schedules. We have stayed at the Marriott in Waikiki before and the nice part was able to walk to many destinations.

We were at the Kahala for three nights over Christmas, after spending a week on the Big Island at the Mauna Kea. In this review, I will provide some thoughts not only about the Kahala, but also that contrast the Kahala with the Mauna Kea to provide some comparison between two of Hawaii’s classic resorts. The Kahala, as most know, is well situated in an upscale residential neighborhood about a 10-15 minute drive from the hustle and bustle of downtown Honolulu. The hotel is tall and built in 1960s style. Clearly the Kahala is very popular with Japanese travelers, as compared with the Mauna Kea which has a guest base that appears more drawn from the US mainland. The lobby area is really beautiful, and the hotel has some nice upscale shops on the main floor. The rooms are very spacious and are gorgeous. We had two rooms – the kids’ room faced the mountains. Ours had a spectacular full-on ocean view with a lanai. Both rooms were very large, with a sitting area and flat screen TVs. The bathrooms are huge, with two separate vanities, an enclosed toilet (heated seat) area, and a separate bath and shower area. The ceilings are high. The rooms are generally really beautiful and updated. In short, the physical space – both the main floor and rooms – was terrific. The physical space of the hotel structure is more upscale than the Mauna Kea, although less spread out. The beach is located within a cove and has no waves due to a coral reef that shelters the beach area. This makes for good swimming and paddle boarding, but no ability to boogey board or body surf. The beach itself is fairly long, although not very deep. The sand was fairly compacted (as compared with the Mauna Kea beach), and almost gives the appearance of a man-made beach. All in all, the beach area was fine, although as noted we were spoiled from having spent 5 nights at the Mauna Kea, where the beach is about as good as it gets. Perhaps the beach scene did not seem as active as one would imagine due to the weather. On the days we were there, the wind was strong in the afternoons, and at times brought moisture (drizzle) from the mountain behind the resort. In general, the weather in late December was much spottier at the Kahala than it was at the Mauna Kea, and the beach/pool area is not nearly as sheltered from the wind as we would have liked. The pool area felt pretty cramped. There is one kidney/oval pool and a Jacuzzi. As with the Mauna Kea, the pool and Jacuzzi are 1960s in design, certainly not the monster pools that newer resorts are building. At the Mauna Kea, it seemed to work better because the pool area was removed from the beach, and there was more physical space available so it felt less cramped. At the Kahala, the pool/beach area was pretty hectic (it was the high season). Much less tranquil than the Mauna Kea, which somehow manages to get through the high season without the resort feeling too full. There is a dolphin lagoon winding through the pool area. It was nice to see the dolphins, although we were of mixed feelings about the whole captive dolphin idea.We ate at the nice restaurant (Arancino), which was very good, and expensive. We also ate at the Plumeria Beach House, on the beach level, which was fine (other than a ridiculously overpriced buffet on Christmas eve, which might have been okay except for the loud children and babies that were packed into the restaurant.) The breakfast scene at Plumeria was largely hectic – one generally had to wait (although not too long) for a table, and the atmosphere was pretty loud. By contrast, the breakfast experience at the Mauna Kea (Manta restaurant), was more laid back. The staff were all lovely – we enjoyed all our interactions. My only gripe was that the concierge was not terribly helpful in helping us plan out our Pearl Harbor visit – did not seem to have a grasp on when we should leave, given our reservation time, how long the various attractions would take, and how to piece together the various aspects of Pearl Harbor (the Arizona memorial, the Missouri, the Bowfin, etc). I felt they should have the Pearl Harbor thing down, since many guests (like us) are there largely to visit Pearl Harbor. We did take a great trip to the north shore where we watched the surfers at the banzai pipeline (spectacular!) and stopped by one of the killer garlic shrimp stands, which we enjoyed more than the $85/person Christmas eve buffet! In closing, don’t get me wrong – we enjoyed our visit to the Kahala. It is a lovely hotel, and we would come again if visiting Oahu. It’s just that the Mauna Kea was a really difficult act to follow. While the Kahala is a very good hotel, it cannot compete, in my view, with some of the more tranquil, spread out resorts elsewhere on the various islands, but maybe it is unfair comparing a Honolulu resort to a resort on a different island. Certainly the Kahala compares well to other Honolulu resorts, most of which are on Waikiki and are probably even more hectic in feel.",Los Angeles,"WestLAFamily</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",100,4.0

With large balconies each morning and evening we would watch the dolphins being fed and exercised and the beach was just 2 minutes from our rooms. There is a nice pool with a jacuzzi - good and hot but to be fair we spent most of the time on the beach going for walks and swimming in the sea. There is a breakwater so the waves aren't massive and fine for swimming. We didn't eat breakfast at the hotel as being over Christmas they were charging $50 per person + + and with 4 of us it would have been very expensive especially because of the terrible rate us Brits are now getting. However, there was a Wholefoods and Longs in the nearby Mall (approx 10 mins walk) and we were able to buy cereals, milk, yogurts and pastries which we put in the fridge provided.

We got married there four years ago and were amazed by the staff work ethic and how they made our day so memorable. They have maintained this level of service throughout our stays and it is always lovely to catch up with Grace who did and amazing job with our wedding. Also appreciate Carlos's help on the front desk during two of our three stays. We were heading out very early the day we left and he was able to organise us room service for breakfast as the buffet would not have been open in time.The buffet breakfast and dinners were always amazing with a large variety of options that covered whatever you may have felt like. Also find their free shuttle service very helpful as you are about 20 minutes away from Waikiki. They make regular drop offs and pick ups at Waikiki, Ala Moana and the Kahala mall which has a really good Whole Foods.Cleaning was impeccable and there was a morning service as well as an evening turn down service. The rooms themselves were a good size to fit two big open cases and still move around with ease. The beds are one of the comfiest we've slept in and the the room in general is beautifully decorated. Bathrooms are very nice with the addition of the heated bidet seat. Did notice that there might need to be a little bit of work done to the paint work in there as it was not up to the Kahala's usual standards. We stayed in a dolphin lanai room for the first time this stay and absolutely loved it. Can quite easily waste a day watching the dolphins pop out of the water to say hi to you or watch the trainers do their work with them.Loved relaxing in the grand lobby and if you are ever going to the Kahala around Christmas time you are in for a treat - their Christmas tree is amazing! Am wondering if Evan who did the floral arrangements for our wedding dressed the tree. Where they find a real tree that perfect and beautiful I've got no idea!Had a nice massage at the Kahala Spa however do feel the pricing is too expensive for what they are offering. Used the fitness centre most mornings which is well set up but could do with much better yoga mats.The beach is beautiful at the Kahala, great for swimming and cooling off but not sure why there weren't umbrellas available for the loungers as we didn't want to get a cabana or covered seat which was offered instead.","Christchurch, New Zealand","Lisa_NZ11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch, New Zealand</strong>",30,5.0

Also other beautiful Christmas decorations adorned the hotel as well with more Christmas decorations and trees downstairs. Our room was huge and overlooked the golf course. The bathroom was also big with 2 basins which worked well - 1 for each of us. Our room was spotless and well appointed.

Everything about Kahala is pure luxury! From the moment you leave the taxi, you are greeted warmly by the bell staff. We were thoroughly impressed by the opulent lobby which seamlessly integrates ancient Hawaiian artifacts and modern Hawaiian styling. The front desk staff was incredibly friendly and allowed us to check in early. Our mountain facing hotel room was massive complete with a sitting area, two closets, two sinks and hot tub. We couldn't believe our room was not considered a suite because it was so luxurious and spacious. Sheets were soft, bed was comfortable and pillows were plentiful. The property is relatively small but the real gem of this resort is their amazing beach, which is private, clean, and has plenty of beach chairs. This is a far cry from nearby Waikiki beach. There is also diverse wildlife on the property with dolphins, sea turtles, and other marine life. We also enjoyed a wonderful afternoon tea service and a delicious meal at their Italian restaurant. At the end of our four day trip, we did not want to leave. We hope we can stay at Kahala every time we come to Oahu!

However, the bathroom is a bit run down and if you look at the details, you see that it needs some deep cleaning. The dust on the doors or in the corners of the floor were not so pleasant to see. Also, the closet is situated in the bathroom which is not so nice for the clothes. They also did not have a full size mirror to see how you look. We also did not have any slippers.Their restaurants had wonderful vegetarian dishes! This was a big plus. Especially the Hoku's and the beachside/poolside bar restaurant outside.They do not have much places with shades to lie down outside. What I did not like was that the tents and the beachbeds were very expensive. The price of the Hotel is very expensive so it should be complimentary. It is a big minus that you have to pay for the tents and the beds. You don't feel pampered enough for the price you pay.The reception was not to our liking. The man talked like a robot but in a fast pace that we felt like he just wanted to throw us all the information he learned at his training. He had no sensitivity to imagine that we just got there and we were dead tired after a night flight and we are not happy to listen to how much a macadamian chocolate would cost at this place in the hotel with a coupon we get or not....

Here are some highlights:- We arrived at 6am and were able to check into our room straight away at no extra cost. This was extremely appreciated as we had a long flight and it was nice to access showers and the room right away. Lei on arrival is a nice touch.- We used the free Kahala shuttle bus to travel to the Kahala Mall and Ala Moana shopping centres, this was very handy and some of the drivers pointed out the sights to see on the trip.- The bathrooms are very well laid out with separate closet space and drawers for each person and included handy items like an iron- We had booked a Romantic Package and prior to our stay had communicated a number of requests e.g. for dietary requirements. We were really impressed that the staff remembered all these requests which made the meals go very smoothly- The buffet breakfast has amazing views and delicious food, the omelette making chefs were great. The thanksgiving buffet was divine with live music and great atmosphere. The staff really get into the holidays and the lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas.- The rooms in the Kahala Spa were beautifully intimate and relaxing - love the infinity baths- The turn down service is a nice touch - the staff left small chocolates on our pillows each night.- Coffee pod machine in the room is a nice touchThere were no major downsides, but the buffet breakfast does get busy (which they tell you), and so some mornings we waited 10-15 minutes to be seated.

During the review session, we were also pleasantly surprised by the movie clip which they put together for us, which included some of the best photos as well as short video clips here and there. We ended up getting the gold package which included 40 or so photos and the movie. We were very happy with the purchase as our son watched the movie over and over again. 1.5 years later, we went back to Hawaii, this time to Oahu. This time we also had our second son who was only 7 months old, and as I found out that Pacific Dream Photography does the photo session at the Kahala hotel which was where my husband I got married, we decided we'd definitely like to do our family photos with our kids there.

Smaller how? Not as many rooms as several of those just around Diamond Head in Waikiki. But small in size is the only ""small"" part of the place. It is huge on service. From the moment I arrived, and was quickly greeted by Heidi covering me with an umbrella to protect me from the rain to Carolyn at the front desk. I sincerely felt like I was truly welcome, just because. My room was lovely and the view was spectacular. I could even see down into the Dolphin pool as well as far into the ocean as big freighters moved along. I could see the back side of Diamond Head. Everyone at this facility is happy to help you. The Dolphin Quest program is a must. All ages can totally enjoy this activity. Not only will you have the joy of being with a Dolphin the staff is quite helpful in teaching you about a Dolphin. The places to eat here are exceptional. The Plumeria has an amazing breakfast, lunch and dinner. Then of course there is Hoku's. Be adventurous and try the tasting menu it is exceptional. Then while you are in your cabana enjoying the ocean there is the Seaside Grill for great food.

Thanks goodness, because the crowds of Waikiki would have been terrible! The Kahala is elegant but not stuffy, and most of the employees seem genuinely happy (not just ""I'm being friendly because it's my job"" happy). In particular, the woman in the gift shop, Jimmy, the bartender at Arancino, and the person who checked us in--perhaps also named James?--were exceptional. Oh, and Lloyd at the pool might seem a bit crusty at first, but once you engage him he has great stories because he's worked there since 1968! Definitely talk to him.The room are quiet, big, plenty of room to put away you belongings. The decor is Colonial Hawaiian. Very comfortable. The only odd part is the goose down duvet, which is too toasty for the tropics. It pretty much requires that you run the AC to sleep.The pool is small, but every two long chairs have umbrellas, which is nice. The beach is great--quiet, relaxing, and the calmest, most shallow water I've ever experienced in Hawai'i. You can wade really far out.The only problem we had was with valet parking. Although, *technically* there's an option to self-park for the same price, the garage was always full, with a sign telling you to go to valet. It's a little inconvenient if you're a spontaneous person and just want to get in your car to go somewhere, but I guess I could live with that if they were at least organized. One time it took them half an hour because 1) they forgot about us, then 2) after about 15-20 minutes I asked about our car, they realized no one had ever gone to get it, then 3) they brought us a Jeep Cherokee, and we were driving a Nissan Sedan. When I said, ""That's not our car,"" the valet said ""Yes, it is."" I said, ""No, it's not, we have a Nissan,"" and he said ""this is your car,"" and showed me the keys with our room number on it, like that made it true. We finally got him to believe it wasn't our car, so that took a while to sort out while they found our *actual* car. This was at 2:30 on a Thursday afternoon, by the way--not at peak hours (one time during peak hours they just forgot to get our car after we'd called down, but that resolved in much less time)The ""peak hours"" issue has a lot to do with how this hotel operates. It's GREAT when they're not busy--personal attention, efficient, friendly, relaxed. But when their occupancy goes up (as it did on our last day there), they can't keep up. This was esp. true with the restaurants, reception, and the aforementioned valet. You have to wait in a lot of lines, can't get reservation, etc. But maybe that's just par for the course for Honolulu.","Portland, OR","LizPdx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, OR</strong>",61,4.0

I have learned that The Kahala Resort has been loved by the local Hawaiian community, and its many famous guests,since the days it was known as the Kahala Hilton, back in the 70s. Some locals still refer to it that way all these years on, and with the same affection they reserve for a much beloved Tutu (grandmother) or elderly aunt. The Kahala has always stood apart in the elegant seaside suburb of Kahala, just 15 minutes drive from the bustle of Waikiki, embraced on one side by the crystal clear waters of the Pacific, and soothed on the other by the lush greenery and cool mountnain breezes of the Waialae Countrry Club . When calmness, serenity, privacy, security and intimacy are atop your wishlist, the Kahala Resort is the ONLY choice on the South Shores of Oahu. The Kahala is as authentic as Audrey Hepburn, apple pie, and its elegant new General Manager.This Grande Dame of Hotels has always seen itself as an honored and respectful member of the Hawaiian Ohana (family) where discerning locals and their families come to decorate the enormous Christmas Tree that adorns the lobby just after Thanksgiving each year, or to indulge in the long-famous, sumptuous seafood buffets - where this very special hotel knows that it truly merits its place in their hearts. The Kahala really is very special - humble, respectful and confident that it will charm and delight. Here, in the quiet 'countryside' just 15 minutes from Waikiki, you are more likely to share the elegant Verandah Lounge for cocktails with a visiting President or Prime Minister, a seasoned veteran of the arts, a 10-goal international polo player or just another very discerning world traveler, than many of the crowded and predictable lodgings to be found jostling for a patch of sand on Waikiki Beach.

Our three night stay was just spectacular with well appointed and spacious rooms, courteous and professional service by a core of long term employees and a very large and pristine beach for sunbathing or long relaxing walks along the shoreline. Dining experiences provided different opportunities to enjoy creative and tasty cuisine without having to leave the property. We found all of the dining options very enjoyable and reasonable for the quality of food and service provided. Would recommend Hoku's for a great dining experience and the Plumeria cafe for more casual all day dining. Either way you will not be disappointed.

Hotel is first class. my room was great and service in all areas was top notch. The hotel is on the other side of Diamond head from Waikiki which in my view is excellent. The area is less congested and the resort has a beach which is more or less private which makes it a wonderful place to relax. This will be my go to place for my next stay on Oahu. I must add one comment regarding the weddings, the have two outdoor venues set up and to be honest I wasn't impressed with either one. I've been to other outdoor weddings and this didn't feel right - seemed more thrown together. The reception was not up to 5 star quality but that may have been more of a comment on what the bridal party selected rather than the resort's capability. That not withstanding - this is a great place to stay.

Attentive valets do not waste any time to assist you unload your luggage and our guest service staff member was delightful and welcoming. We were given cool towels and a joyful welcome with lays. Unfortunately the joy ended after a long haul flight when we were given a room that obviously had a mouldy air conditioning unit We are asthmatics so that was a disaster but the lengths the Receptionist went to to talk us out of moving were unprecedented. Offers included a purifier, wait until tomorrow, other rooms are noisy, we may not have another room. We were also given a supposedly quiet room in the middle of a large wedding party that had all of their doors open, so it was chaotic. Do not accept this rhetoric that is full of contempt. It didn’t matter that it was our second stay and the staff member was awful. They should do better given their luxury rating. We eventually got a room lower down that overlooks the golf course and it was quiet with a lovely view of the golf course anyway they didn’t notify us and we had to chase it up after 4pm. We had a base room and they are fine unless you need an ocean view. They are large and the best asset for a family is the two separate sinks, a separate bath and toilet resulting in an ease in getting organised for the day. The toilet is one of those Asian ones that do all their fancy work and I personally don’t like a heated seat in the tropical weather though as we couldnt turn that off. The beds are small. More like a Large King single in Australia and not really a double, but they have luxurious bedding, really clean and crisp linens and a very comfortable bed. It did accommodate two people in the bed though. All of the amenities were quality and the cleaning impeccable. I loved those turndown chocolates and wished I had bought a large stock before leaving.Kids will like the fish and stingray in the lagoon and we liked looking at the dolphins until we saw a guest hassle them late at night by taking photos with a flash. We were not happy about this and let security know.The staff in this hotel are generally very warm, engaging, patient, professional and assist you with your every request. We organised our car hire from Australia so we got all of the appropriate insurances with Hertz as they were onsite. We got a great deal but the service was much better than other car hire companies that we dealt with in Hawaii . So was the return of the car to the airport, hassle free. It does cost $32 US to park, so we arranged it on the last day of our stay. The valets are outstanding and always quick, polite and friendly.Breakfast was a great fare with the usual omelette station, a friendly knowledgeable cook, hot foods in abundance, plenty of fresh fruit, pastries, some Asian foods ie. Miso and salmon. The foods were top quality and the staff were really attentive. It was particularly busy on Sunday, so book a table. Just watch the cheeky birds or they will be eating your breakfast when you turn your back. This buffet had superior items when compared to other 5 star hotels in Hawaii and the restaurant has a lovely relaxing outlook to the beach. It is expensive at $38 US, I am fairly sure there is a continental component that is less expensive. You can use the chairs on the beach which are in abundance but the cabanas were an extra cost. We still got service on the beach, but you had to look for it and it was a long while. We like this beach because it is protected but there are no waves to play on as such which will suits smaller children. The surfcraft staff were really friendly and knowledgable too but the hire costs were expensive. We bought some lilos to float around the ocean. The pool isn’t huge but the service is good and there are always good quality chair covers and fluffy towels available. The restaurants were pricey and the Italian restaurant was probably the best value but still pricey. We only discovered at the end of our stay that they do take aways. We utilised the shuttle and went to the Kahala Mall to eat at a good restaurant and get supplies at Wholefoods. The shuttle also went to Waikiki and Ala Moana shopping centre. There wasn’t a great deal of times but more than enough to eat and return on the last shuttle if you chose to.

But falling out of bed from a Dolphin Lagoon room to hotfoot across pristine sand into 80.2 degree water in October is an easy sell. A very easy sell. And what a sales team. Whilst the atmosphere is far from regimented, it is made all the more special by its staff. If the new GM is within earshot, Sam, Lloyd, Charlotte, Moonie and Tyler all deserve hearty plaudits. The Kahala gets all the small stuff right - from the complimentary Kona coffee served from 5.30am to the scrumptious chocs never too far from the pillow. You don't snag every President since Lyndon B. Johnson by not knowing how to run your unit.Breakfast at the Plumeria Beach House is a comprehensive spread, and the afternoon tea at The Veranda is very civilised without being overly formal.

Everything is, from parking (although, nice that valet is the same as self-park, so, heck yeah, valet) to cocktails ($16 for mai tai, but, then, you can order it from your lounge chair at the private beach, which makes up for a lot). So, to my fellow splugers: don't forget you'll want to splurge on the rest of the stuff too. It's worth it. A note about the dolphins: I'm really not in to captive dolphins. All the literature said they would be there, so I can't say it was hidden. But, man, they are *right there.* Like, you can watch them from the pool.

This was our fourth trip there. Overall, it was, as expected, wonderful. But.....we once again experienced some of the restaurant service issues that I have noticed in the past.We will start with the good news: Our room was magnificent, with a great view of the mountains. We pretty much left our door to the lanai open at all times and enjoyed the fresh air. The king bed was super comfortable and the hotel has replaced its older, seemingly first generation flat screens with modern televisions. The maid service was, as usual, first rate, as was the hotel staff generally.We loved waking up early each morning--we were on west coast time--and going to Plumeria for breakfast. Watching every sunrise from the patio there was magnificent. As I have written in the past, I think the breakfast buffet is excellent and a good value, especially if you can make it last until dinner (but hard to do on west coast time when you are eating before 7 am.) After breakfast each morning we took a walk down the beach and imagined that we had enough money to buy one of the empty beach front mansions. Try it at least once: when you walk back the view of the hotel against the mountains is worth it. We loved hanging out at the pool and swimming in the ocean. One really positive development is that service around the pool and beach has totally improved. For the first time ever on our trips they seemed to be fully staffed. And, they wisely put nachos back on the menu outside, which now seems to have something for everyone.This brings us to the bad news: service at the Veranda was, inexplicably, inconsistent at best and terrible at worst. Every time we went there it took way too long to get drinks. In fact, there were times when we would be seated and not see staff for more than fifteen minutes. It was strange because they seemed to be sufficiently staffed. At times it appeared that the staff did not have specific area assignments. We could never figure out their system. In fairness, it must be said that the staff there was friendly and seemed to be trying (especially the obviously new staff). I also loved their marinated mushroom salad and the shrimp cocktail was a surprisingly good value. Not incidentally, the Veranda has new tables and chairs and seems to be upscaled a bit since our last trip. I suggest--if anyone in management is listening--that the Veranda go back to, and stick with, the Mad Men cocktail bar theme. Sometimes what the adults want is a stiff Martini and a big plate of food.Also on the negative side were the menu options at Plumeria. Even on normal nights it isn't a particularly expansive menu. But what we really objected to was the nearly non-existent menu on Saturday and Sunday, when Plumeria offered their seafood buffet. It just doesn't make sense; their room service menu was operational, so why should you not be able to get the very excellent Kahala burger for dinner on the weekend? A cynic might say they are trying to get people to spend the $60+ on the buffet....I will try to write an official review for Arancino, the Italian restaurant at the hotel, but suffice say that the drinks and service there are excellent but as far as the food goes stick with their excellent pizza.The shuttle to Hanauma bay, which includes gear, was quite reasonable at $29. But understand that you are just paying for a taxi ride and the gear, not any kind of expertise or guidance at the beach. But go there for sure, as the snorkeling is incredible.Also, if you like to fish you can sign up for a fun canoe trip straight out into the surf from the Kahala beach. Every year I go and always catch some really strange fish. Thumbs up to their guide Peter, whom you will see around the pool running their surfing and paddle boarding services.I am being generous giving Kahala a five on this trip; probably a four or four and a half is more accurate.

Our room was in the dolphin wing, main floor with a view onto the golf course. The view from the window was therefore, ""OK"". It is a very beautiful hotel, with a very scenic beach. I didn't quite get the VIP experience that other people were experiencing as our room was inconsistently managed. Some days we would get our toiletries, other days we had to ask. The last day I would received the daily newspaper---but not other 3 days? One evening around 6pm we came back to the hotel after a long day out to find that our room wasn't even touched (I ensured no 'do not disturb' sign was displayed that morning), and no clean towels available to shower. I was also sent a defective blow dryer and had to call in another. I haved called the front desk for a lot of things over the course of my stay, and I felt uncomfortable about appearing needy and annoying. At least they were mostly nice about it. On the plus side, the in-house Pacific Dream Photography gave us a fun complimentary photo session, and the director Julia really accommodated us to make us happy with their services.

The Ocean Front room with a view of the pool, dolphins, Diamond Head, Kona Head and the beach is probably the best hotel room view we've ever experienced. After good meals at 3 of the 4 on-site restaurants (we skipped Hoku), we'd relax on the lanai and enjoy the blissful sounds of the ocean. Everyone at the resort was very friendly. The room was spacious and had an initial wow factor, only some slight imperfections. The breakfast buffet at Plumeria Beach house is fantastic. Skipped Hoku which is supposedly the best but the other 3 were better than average. Was skeptical of using the shuttle to Honolulu but it was efficient and the driver provided excellent info as he drove. Research the resort costs so you know what you're in for. There are no ""bargains"" here. Being removed from the city, the gift shop could use some less expensive food and drink options. We would return in a heartbeat. It will be difficult to return to the madness that is Waikiki after the calm relaxation of Kahala.","Allentown, Pennsylvania","ParklandPride</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Allentown, Pennsylvania</strong>",44,5.0

The good:1) Our room is spacious despite being a standard 'deluxe', with the bathroom in particular being a great size2) We were 'upgraded' to a room with a balcony. The view is of the golf course behind the hotel though.3) It is away from the chaos of Wakiki and the resort offers a shuttle service there (or I guess it's a cheap Uber ride away)The disappointing:1) Upon check in we noticed on the back of the key wallet that parking is $32 per night whether we use the valet or self park. I can't really see any other option either given the immediate surroundings. This is going to really add up as we are here for 5 nights. There were no warnings in advance, and when I questioned it I was told by the receptionist that it was cheap because we were not paying a resort fee!2) Most of the outside space is taken up by a lagoon which is home to some dolphins, turtles and other sea life who really belong in the sea. It is not only really sad to see, but it also takes away valuable recreational space as the pool area is tiny given the size of the hotel. It seems really overcrowded, including the stretch of beach. The children's pool is the size of a hot tub.3) We waited for a good 10 minutes to get our car back out of the valet tonight. When we had arrived this afternoon the self park lot was full so that wasn't even an option for us. It's so frustrating waiting to just get your car to leave the hotel.We will see how the remainder of the stay works out. In conclusion I am disappointed at the initial impressions, and hope that the level of service somehow out-weighs the negatives going forward.","London, United Kingdom","KatCon1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",85,3.0

Even the view from the hallway right outside the elevators was stunning, perfect view of the lush green mountains. I grew up in Hawaii (but now live in NYC), and places like The Kahala make me so proud to be Hawaiian. Since we were celebrating a special occasion, the hotel brought us champagne and chocolate strawberries. It was a little awkward that they brought it to us while we had settled into our room, and my husband was on the toilet at the time! The quality of everything was beautiful, from the bedding to the bidet, to the gorgeous lobby. In fact, the lobby is probably the most beautiful lobby I've ever seen -- even if you're not a guest, come to the Kahala just to see it! I love the chic island vibes throughout the hotel. It's so nice not to be in a sterile chain hotel. Very good service, although for such a high price it would have been nice if more services were complimentary, such as paddle boarding and cabana rentals.I would recommend this to anyone celebrating a special occasion.

It also compares very well to the Royal Hawaiian. It has a much more private relaxing feel of a resort. It has a real beach, gym and spa, and you don't see crowds all over the place or walk right into Waikiki. The eating options are also better. Our kid got up at 4am from jetlag the first day and my wife and him took a nice walk out on the beach; someone from the breakfast buffet gave him a croissant to hold him over till meal time. We had two connecting rooms at the end of a hall overlooking the golf course; they were beautiful large rooms, one with a terrace, and there was no need to have something overlooking the ocean or the dolphins -- I'm not at all sure we would have liked one of the lanai suites at ground level which would not have been private. The bathroom amenities were very good. The hotel's gym is great and open 24 hours; I really liked the sauna area which was also very private. The hotel is fairly compact and it is easy to get around it, and this also made us feel comfortable to have our 9 year old son run around on his own and not worry so much. Peter, the pool manager, was really nice to us; he gave our kids surfing lessons and swam out with them to this little island they wanted to go to and outfitted them with special shoes to avoid getting hurt from the rocks; he charged us for one hour and was out with them for two. He was also a really good instructor. My massage at the spa was in the top 20%. They also have a treatment for sunburn which is useful. Despite using lots of sunscreen, I got real red. The surf in summer was beautiful and swimming in the ocean was a real delight. The breakfast buffet is excellent; dinner at the hotel's signature restaurant was also excellent with a particularly good tuna. I was upset at the corn soup being something like 5 spoonfuls in a plate for about $15; i mentioned it but they didn't bring me any more. They have a buffet in their restaurant on weekends but it didn't include a single cooked vegetable, which is a problem for people who want vegetables without meat or shellfish. I didn't see any of the beautiful mangoes or avocados at the hotel like I saw in the nearby farmer's market. Basically, the hotel doesn't showcase the local produce. The weakest area of food in the hotel is the pool area, which could use a more expansive menu. We enjoyed the lobby entertainment on the weekend, particularly the piano bar. The hotel's kid camp evening program was better than most hotels, with interesting arts and crafts and a crabbing night adventure. Our son brought his crab back to our room to spend the night and mistakenly let it loose at the breakfast buffet; an alert waiter caught it just before a riot broke out after a diner noticed. The hotel is conveniently located to Diamond Head; we were able to do an early morning hike using a taxi from the hotel entrance. The business center was also good and the hotel worked well with us when our flight to Tokyo was delayed 24 hours and we had to deal with it. My mistake was not consulting with the hotel concierge before booking a private tour of Pearl Harbor through another company over the internet. We paid a lot of money for what we got and it might have paid to do it through the hotel. We didn't do the dolphin adventure; we've done that elsewhere. The pool itself is a bit small but overall we were happy that the pool area was calm and the beach was a place you could certainly find a lounge anytime on this private beach. Compared to the hullabaloo we saw on Waikiki this was not comparable.The rates and prices here were good value for money with room rates in summer being quite reasonable especially with Amex Fine Hotel & Resort benefits thrown in.","New York City, New York","649ic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",646,5.0

The staff at the resort were very friendly and professional. The parking attendants were awesome. The beach was very nice and we got chairs with no problem. The beach was never crowded when we went. We took the complementary shuttle to downtown which was great so we didn't have to drive and deal with parking. The only complaint that I had was that when I booked the room I reserved a 2 bed room which they said they didn't have any available. They did provide a roll away bed which was ok but I was disappointed.

It is a good hotel, but nothing else. 1- Location That is perfect. The private beach is awesome, once you are away from the crowds on Waikiki. It is a truly beautiful beach. BUT - be prepared - if you want a nice place at the beach, you will have to pay for your cabana. 2 - RestaurantOn our first day at the hotel we had to wait about 30 minutes to get into the restaurant to have our breakfast. It was really annoying as people (not only guests) were agglomerated in the tiny hall in front of the restaurant , many of the sat at the stairs. Besides that long wait line, breakfast was ok. Nothing espectacular - you cannot compare to the ones at Four Seasons or other international hotels. We also had the opportunity to have the dinner buffet and once again, it was ok. I was expecting much more. 3 - Swimming pool Disappointing. A very small swimming pool considering the number of the guests. Kids were playing loudly and there was no much space left for the adults. Also, it was super hard to find a chair - there are a few of them and once again you will have to pay for the best ones. 4 - Dolphin So sad to see those dolphins swimming in such a small lagoon. Believe me, I do not have any picture of the them because i felt really sad. My last experience with dolphins was at Atlantis Hotel in Dubai and, sincerely, there is no way to compare both experiences. 5 - Rooms Spacious and clean. Bed super comfortable. My opinion is that Kahala is still a choice for those who lived in the 70's and had opportunity to enjoy its glamour on that time. But if you are a younger couple, Kahala is still an option because of its beach and location, but be aware that it is outdated and you will have to share your lift rides and lobby time with some very arrogant people (i'm not talking about the staff, but the guests)","Westport, Connecticut","akiakola</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Westport, Connecticut</strong>",135,3.0

The hotel is need of updating - carpet, furnishing, etc. The major updating/renovation at the Sheraton/Waikiki some 8-10 years ago attests to what thoughtful changes can be made with benefits. I was happy to receive an unsolicited ""upgrade"" to a upper floor ocean view room. I do like the mauka side though - cooler and views of the city lights on the ridges.Convenient location to Kaimuki, Kahala mall, my relatives and the H1(major freeway).",,mc769,2,4.0

It just doesn't get any better. Everyone is so friendly and eager to please. Everything is so peaceful and beautiful. The location is beyond fantastic. You have all the advantages of being close to Waikiki beach but none of the noise and congestion. If you're coming to be part of the noise, Kahala is not for you. We came as a couple, but it is also very family oriented as well. Some places that are family oriented tend to lose the quiet romantic feel but Kahala definitely does not. Our mountain lanai room was roomy and spectacular in every way. I enclosed a picture from our balcony. I don't usually notice bedding. I'll sleep on anything, but even I could tell it was exceptional. The beach is quiet and secluded and oh so beautiful. We had never been to Hawaii, so this visit was on our bucket list, and coming here only made us want to add it to the ""bucket list"" a dozen more times! Walking to diamond head, doing yoga on surfboards, swimming with dolphins. All on premises. It's like out of a fantasy. I would give a million stars if I could. If I were nitpicking I would point out that they strangely nickel and dime you for some strange things like printing out a few pages or taking a class, but even in that department, they are very generous with bottled water all over the property and free wifi and a free shuttle to the Waikiki area and free bicycle rentals so they exceed all expectations in that department as well.

All menu items and buffet items are marked with codes to let you know what to watch out for. The hotel went over and beyond to ensure my son had wheat free food. He was able to customize his meals and the Plumeria Manager sent out for gluten free pancake mix and other items so he could have a variety of breakfast options. His allergy was flagged on our file so all restaurants knew to take special precautions preparing and handling his food.

The rooms are enormous which is great it's just the quality and finishes that are a little tired now. The beach is fantastic and away from the craziness of Waikiki beach. The waiters on the beach only start at 11 which is a bit of an irritation and the pool is too small for the number of guests so makes the whole thing a little crowded. Personally I think they should do away with the Dolphins and let them free. The pond they keep them in is too small. Breakfast is ok, could be better, could be worse. The queuing to get and get a table drove me mad originally but then I realised you could book. Not something I am used to. Overall - it is a solid 4 star. Lacks ""cool"" factor. One word o.

The spa is amazing and well worth the splurge for a truly remarkable experience for the senses. My only complaint was the silly drinks prices. I like to relax with a few cocktails at the bar in the evenings, but the prices of the drinks sent me to Longs drug for a bottle of vodka and mixers. Sixteen dollars for a glass of Chardonnay! Nine dollars for a beer, and $16-22 for specialty cocktails. I wouldn't mind paying the money if they were strong drinks, but the bartenders barely fill the one shot tumbler and the drinks taste like kiddy drinks. The sad thing is, the beautiful beachside bar was mostly devoid of customers around the clock , and my guess is it's because of the ridiculous prices. Nobody wants a bar full of rowdy drinkers, but my guess is the hotel would make more money if they changed tactics and made the drinks either stronger or cheaper, and in doing so tempted more people to hang out and socialize at the bar.

Here’s an official review by someone not paid or given gratis. Just your basic vacationer and lover of all things beautiful in good repair.WALL OF CELEBRITIES The wall with signed and framed photos of celebrities that have visited the Kahala in the past is, well a thing of the past. The photos have been moved to a wall near the lower level public restroom. And for good reason, no one of serious consequence has visited the resort, or had their photo taken, since Michael Jackson in 1987. But no biggie since cool and chic is a matter of conversation and social media. You could be sitting in a pool of rubber cement and if the general consensus was YEA MAN, then everyone would conquer and jump in. I get it.INSIDE TRACK Serious renovation needed. Walls, and hardware throughout especially in the lagoon wing, rusted; window seals, dirty and dead bug invested. Mirrored accent pieces: Moisture damage. Art: Three gorgeous framed island originals: matting either not wet-sanded or moisture has permeated and caused edges to lift. Very Tacky. Original chandeliers still impressive, and would be stunning if they were cleaned so that they could regain their glory as prisms of light. LAGOON WING If you are wondering where base meets oxidized painted wall and dated stone slate flooring, yes there is visible moisture damage. If you are considering a stay, seriously contemplate if there is any concern for the impact mold may have on you or your loved one's health. The visible markers on stairs, walkways and dirty carpet are staggering. Minimum renovations needed: Flooring, paint, window seals, rails, casings, and air-conditioning.UNRESPONSIVE Let’s talk Hotel staff for a moment. After searching your face for any sign of celebrity, which results in a no-go, you are demoted to your average guest with just enough money to maybe book a room. “You may wait for your reservation over there and no you may not use the basic free internet on the property. It is for our guests only.” Define guest. One who eats? Or one who sleeps? Either way it doesn’t mitigate the fact. Hotel Condition: Dilapidated",,Lisa W,5,2.0

Three weeks later I find out they charge us $300 more because they forgot to add one dining charge on the receipt. The charge is,legitimate, and we paid the bill of course; but when I settle a bill, I expect the bill to be accurate.

So immediately I was drawn into the Kahala Hotel as it is a luxury hotel that is secluded. Staying in Waikiki would definitely have been noisier and crowded... not ideal for this type of thing. Long story short our experience at this hotel was amazing and the staff went the extra mile to make sure the proposal went perfect.Room - The Ocean View Suite was amazing. Our room was located right above the dolphin pool with a view straight at the ocean. It almost felt too big! Awesome view, beautiful room, no noise, check.Service - We were treated like royalty from the moment we arrived. The valet boys gave us a warm welcome and were extremely polite, the front desk greeted us with leis, the masseuses we had did an amazing job, and our waitress at Hoku's restaurant was funny and very attentive. I had also made many requests for the big night and was in constant contact with Shannon Ladd from HR. She went out of her way and made sure everything was taken care of. I can thanks everyone enough for making us feel so special that day.Proposal - For my proposal, I wanted to incorporate a Japanese holiday called ""Tanabata"". For this holiday, people would write their wishes on a piece of paper and hang it on a bamboo plant in order for it to come true. So prior to our stay, I dropped off a bamboo plant and asked if they could set that up before we arrived. Sure enough, the plant was set up when we got into our rooms and we wrote our wishes and hung it. We then went to eat dinner, during which some of my friends snuck into the room to set up hidden cameras and decorate it with rose petals and candles (LED, of course). The hotel was also accommodating with this request and even allowed my friends to enter the hotel through the basement to lower the risk of any accidental encounter. After everything was set up we returned to the room and she immediately thought we entered the wrong room. I laughed and reassured her this was the room and she finally caught on and teared up. Behind our wish was another piece of paper with the big question and I kneeled down and showed her the ring. It was a very emotional experience for both of us, and she nodded with her eyes flowing in tears. A few minutes later my friends showed up with a cart full of champagne (thanks to the Kahala for allowing us to use this) and a final reveal that I had also secretly brought her friend to Hawaii for this night. In the end, I don't think there was a dry eye and it couldn't have been possible anywhere else.

Checked in and room was not ready however we were upgraded to beautiful room with patio and ocean views. Daily buffet breakfast was very good and beach service during the day was good, too. We did not go to pool - too small and too crowded with little kids and families. Used the gym and attended a couple of fitness classes that were basically private, which was a nice surprise...of course you have to pay extra for any group class. Rented kayaks and SUP and enjoyed using those. Beach never felt overly crowded although we did notice that non-hotel guests were using the chairs and beach area and I guess there's nothing to be done about that. We once had to ask a group of 20-somethings to turn down their metal music but the manager handled it graciously. (This group was acting like they were on Daytona Beach which was unexpected.)Overall a very good value for our quick vacation but probably a much better venue for families rather than for a couple. Not particularly romantic. We would come back with the kids!!","Los Angeles, California","SueLAXtravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",12,4.0

This was our first time in Hawaii and we were celebrating a few milestones as a couple, so we wanted something relaxing and a little beyond the ordinary. We are also budget conscious travelers, so we booked this and airfare combo from Seattle through a well-known travel site.The hotel is grand. It is located 15 minutes east from the Waikiki area, 20 minutes from the airport, and is bordered by a high-end residential area. Access to Highway 1 is 5 minutes. We rented a car to take day trips to different parts of the island, but there is a free shuttle that runs several times a day and picks up/drops off from multiple points in the Kahala/Waikiki beach area. Parking was a premium at $32/night, but when you calculate Ubers, taxis, shuttles, tips, and convenience, we figured this would work best for us. The resort has multiple areas including a high-rise portion, as well as rooms that circled the dolphin pools and ""private"" beach (accessible to the public, but bordered by two small peninsulas at either end of the hotel). There is a public beach that can be accessed through the outlet or just walking Kahala road, but we never made it that far. We stayed on the main floor and although they placed us in a room next to the maids' work room and elevators, a quick call to the front desk ended with a duplicate room in a more quiet area within 2 minutes. They didn't just move us- they wanted us to check the alternate room out first before we committed. Since we were also celebrating a belated anniversary, they provided complimentary sparkling wine on our second day. We also needed to print out a travel item and the front desk did it free of charge (it was one page), even though we could use an office area for a charge. It was superb service!I was amazed at the access points within the hotel- we had to explore the hotel first, but even though resorts can be so massive that it feels like a short hike anytime you want to go to the pool, the Kahala's entry points were all thoughtfully distributed so you could walk to the pool/beach area within a few minutes. The rooms we had access to were similar- a bed/desk area in cream/yellow/gold/baby blue tones. The bathroom was a highlight of the trip- it had two closets, two separate facing vanity areas, a tub with a gorgeous hose, and a separate, enclosed shower that had a retractable clothes line. The bathroom also had a Keurig and a compact fridge- perfect for housing some beers we brought from Don Q grocery! The star of the bathroom was the Toto toilet, which had an internal seat warmer. Our room faced the golf course, and it was a perfect, quiet spot for us. The room was air conditioned, but the air conditioning system automatically shuts off when you open the large windows to let the sea breezes in. There are rooms that also overlook the grand entrace/parking lot, high-rise rooms that overlook the local region, and rooms with direct access to the beach and pool areas, so there is a lot of variety! My husband was obsessed with visiting the dolphins. An encounter with the dolphins in the water is pricey- about $200+ for some quality time, but they are really close to you near the gates that line their pools, so we lived vicariously through the many kids that visited. We also visited the dolphins during the evening and they would make snapping noises with their teeth and sleep on the side of their pools- this was a really special and unique feature of the resort! Adjacent to the dolphin pools was a manta ray pool which housed two very large rays, and the regular people pool and hot tub. Surrounding all these pools was a cabana poolside lounge area and the hotel's main sit-down restaurant (I believe the buffet breakfasts, etc. were served here).The food on the premises was very expensive, we didn't partake, but it seemed like high quality. There were also two high-end restaurants on the property- Arancini's, which was italian, and a restaurant with high-end Hawaiian that opened up to the veranda in the front of the hotel, served drinks, and hosted a tea time.The resort has a wall on the main floor with pictures of special visitors (politicos and well-known entertainers of all types), a few clothing stores, and a spa area with private massage rooms. We also took a tour through the fitness area, and I was impressed- this was a complete gym with barbells, all kinds of new cardio machines, towels, etc. adjoining a separate women's and men's spa rooms, each with its own hot tub, steam and sauna rooms, showering areas, and lockers. This area was a bit off to the side of the resort, but it was probably the nicest and most complete fitness area I've ever seen in a hotel.There was nightly turn-down service with two sea salt chocolates, luxury bath and body products, and small touches like personal slippers and a light blue Kahala bag to tote your stuff to the beach. This was one of the best hotel/resorts I have ever been to, and although we didn't budget for personal massages and high-end eating, the resort was close to everything (even a Whole Foods in the Kahala mall!) that we always felt like we had access to it all! Although we visited Waikiki for the action, I would prefer to stay at this hotel instead.",,marnone,9,5.0

Everyone, at all times, made us feel welcome and taken care of. While most hotels offer good service, the Kahala staff seemed to genuinely care, a perfect example being this- while riding in the elevator, we were chatting with a staff member who said, with complete honestly, 'thank you so much for staying with us, we appreciate it"" and it came from the heart. They really did seem to know we had a choice of where to stay, and they took care of us so we'd return. And we will- we've already booked a return visit in January.The rooms are quite large, complete with a mini fridge which is helpful. The grounds are beautiful, and the beach is great- calm, warm waters, away from the bustle that is Waikiki. There are several small touches that were welcome, such as complementary coffee and tea downstairs starting at 5:30 am, bottled waters when we arrived and at varying times through the visit, music on the veranda, the list goes on.The Kahala was perfect for our holiday, and while the property is outstanding, the people were even more so.","Oak Park, California","mrg128</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oak Park, California</strong>",42,5.0

We arrived at night and check in did not go well as the rooms we booked were not available and we had to split between several floors and get roll away beds. Tyler did not do a good job dealing with the situation at all. However, management response to my complaint was outstanding and we were eventually moved and even upgraded two days later. The rooms were large and the bath room outstanding (heated toilet cover). We had great views and one room had a nice balcony to enjoy. The beach was great and we enjoyed the amazing views a lot. Also a lot of fun to eat outside at Plumeria and enjoy the surroundings/ view. I did not like the price of the restaurants though... Really a rip off for what is being offered. Breakfast buffet at 35$ per person! Good quality but nothing exceptional for that price either. I recommend to go outside to places in Waikiki for dinner that are much better value. For breakfast I recommend Koko head cafe and for lunch Diamond Head Market and Grill. If you have a rental car, parking costs almost as much as your daily rental costs and I thought that was over the top. 32$/ day and tip for valet as self pArking was not an option most days as fully occupied. I enjoyed the fact that the hotel was close to Waikiki and attractions like Diamond Head / Pearl Harbor/ Honolulu city and it offers a relaxing stay. It has a lot of pluses and potential but management needs to work on cost/ service level. I dont want to pay extra for everything if I book such an expensive stay. Just remember that if you wanted a beach chair with cover you were charged 65$ and for cabana 110$. The concierge service was outstanding though and specifically want to mention Cameron who provided us with some great tips. If you want to attend a Luau though book a few weeks in advance! Overall good stay and nice hotel/ calm alternative to Waikiki but high cost for services offered.

I just wanna say, that if you're traveling with more than two people and plan on eating at the hotel. the prices are insane. and not the good insane. If you're trying to save a bit of money on your Hawaii Vacation, you should probably stay away from this hotel. Now Staying at the Kahala Hotel and Resort was amazing! I loved every bit of it!! When we arrived it was about midnight, and I'd say that's the best time to check in because Wilson at the front desk is so kind, friendly, and helpful! He really knew how to start this trip off! We first had an issue with our room not being the right one, we originally booked a room with double beds, but got one bed instead, and Wilson quickly solved the problem! He had helped us out by giving us a nice roll away bed! Not the fold up kind, but the kind that is an actual mattress! Free of charge because our room was incorrectly booked, and we had papers to prove it. Not only that but Kyle who helped at Valet was so kind and genuinely a nice person, he showed us our room and all of the great things that it comes with! And Lance, whom, I'm not sure what his title is, but he helped with setting up our roll away bed, was one of my favorite staff members the whole trip. Now we stayed for a week and the entire week, I only looked forward to seeing or being helped by Kyle, Wilson, and Lance. And that tells you something considering I was at the pool and beach majority of the stay and NONE of them work at the pool or beach. Now with every great reviews come complaints. The first thing I didn't enjoy was the parking cost and valet cost. Now I don't mind the valet too much, but parking is $32. PER DAY. I'm already staying at your hotel, which is costing me an arm and a leg, plus I'm paying for a whole week with a rental car. I eventually paid the same amount as I ate at restaurants. Not only that but if you choose to valet it's $32+Tip. so it all adds up. The next thing that bothered me was the fact that all of the restaurants' costs were not the greatest! It was a lot, we had breakfast at the Plumeria Beach House and 3 adults & 1 child's buffet ended up costing a little more than parking. and that was only ONE morning. could you imagine what the price for all of this would be if it was the whole week!?! It's ridiculous! I get I'm on vacation, but it felt like I was constantly watching what was being spent. And the last complaint I have with this hotel would be the Dolphin Quest. I wish there was a price or a deal with in-house guests, because we are staying at the hotel and all the prices are not meant for in-house guests. They're really all for anyone, and I understand that Dolphin Quest is a separate business, but come on, if you're having a room with a view of dolphins how could you not get a price meant for in-house guests? I just didn't understand it.I also didn't understand the cabana rentals by the beach and pool area. you would rent it for $65 a whole day, but after 5:30 it becomes free....doesn't make much sense to me since it's barely dark out at 5:30. BUT I did enjoy the private beach we had as well as the pool! You could be at the pool for half a day and then walk down a few steps to be at the beach! It was amazing, the privacy, the amount of people that were there, the view! It was all great! I did not want to leave at the end of my trip.Overall, great hotel and great staff! My only concern is the prices, if you're staying for a week with kids, things add up. e","Los Angeles, California","annikacha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",3,5.0

We have always stayed in Waikiki or near Ala Moana. Last year we visited the Kahala for lunch and at the time decided we would return to stay for our next Hawaiian visit. The Kahala is PERFECT in every way! Pool staff were so helpful getting us loungers and towels set up every day. We loved having the option of the beach so close to the pool. Unlike Waikiki the beach was not crowded at all and perfect for swimming and paddle boarding. The rooms are generous in size and beautifully appointed. We were on the 9th floor overlooking the golf course which whilst it wasn't sea view it was still a spectacular view. There was an empty fridge in our room which we filled with snacks and drinks (important when travelling with kids) which we purchased from the fabulous Wholefoods at the nearby Kahala Mall - 5 mins in the free hotel shuttle! We used this free service most days as the shuttle also takes you to Ala Moana shopping Centre.We had heard that the Sunday brunch at Hoku's was a must so we booked (you do need to book) and had the most unbelievable, stand out food I have ever eaten from a brunch buffet. My daughters loved the dessert table along with the chocolate fountain - my husband and I feasted on some of the best sushi and sashimi before moving onto the amazing array of cooked food (the beef and lamb were cooked to perfection) washed down with glasses of mimosa.For our daughters the highlight was being able to swim with the Dolphins. I was so impressed with the Dolphin Quest staff who were just lovely, super professional and I loved that they also educated my daughters about these beautiful creatures. Quite pricey but WELL worth it!We have stayed at many top end, fabulous hotels in Honolulu over the last 4 years but I have to say there is something special about the Kahala...We will be returning next year ","Auckland Central, New Zealand","torsporterandrews</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",4,5.0

In a nutshell, I'm picky and I like five star properties. The Kahala not only delivered on my expectations, but went above and beyond and we will choose to stay at the Kahala whenever we find ourselves on Oahu. I wouldn't say Kahala is five star, but it gets 4.5 in my rating book.We like the shopping and energy of Waikiki, but after staying two nights in the area, I wanted to end our trip with more peaceful surroundings, so fortunately, the Kahala had last minute availability and we spent our last 36 hours at the resort and I'm so glad we did!The reception at check-in was warm, we were given an upgraded room (Amex Platinum Card) and the bellman were very helpful as we settled into our gorgeous room with an amazing ocean view. There was limited hotel availability, so my family of four had to stay in one room and roll away beds were quickly set up. A bit tight and had we stayed longer, we would have reserved a suite or two rooms to be more comfortable. But, I was very impressed with how generous in size the standard rooms are and for one night, it was fine bunking up with the family.This hotel reminds me of the old Kapalua Bay Hotel on Maui which in my opinion, was a hidden gem, classic 60's Hawaiian hotel, but it unfortunately succumbed to condos. The Kahala has a similar vibe. It retains some of that old Hollywood Hawaiian glamour. And, this was accented by a view star sightings we had while on property which is always fun. I hope they do not try to change the core soul of this property. Please don't mistake the old-school nostalgia with dated and tacky...It's not. The Kahala is very well maintained, the ground are gorgeous and the service was nearly on par with what we experience at the Four Seasons properties in Hawaii.One of our gripes with Waikiki is the noise and the crowded beaches...If you want a public beach and are ok with that, Waikiki is a terrific option. All beaches in Hawaii are public, btw, but the beach at the Kahala feels very very private and is edged next to a reef protected lagoon. Not only is the setting gorgeous, but it is very relaxing and feels exclusive. We never struggled to find beach chairs and the beach service is amazingly attentive. Not something you will EVER find in Waikiki. So,we loved this and cooked in the sun a bit longer than we should have.If there is one trite complaint, it is that the pool is smallish for a hotel of this caliber. And, I could see where the hotel might want to add another pool option, but it was not an issue and pool chairs were also plentiful, as was the pool service.We dined every meal at the hotel and I think visited all restaurants except the steakhouse which was not available. Our favorite spot was the Italian restaurant, absolutely delicious! Modestly priced (for Hawaii) and the wine list was amazing (also well priced). The open cafe was terrific for lunch and breakfast and we indulged in the seafood buffet one night which was terrific and in my opinion, well priced for Hawaii.We did not use the fitness room, but did use the steam and jacuzzi amenities...Hmm, I would actually complain a bit about these areas...They were fully functional, but could use some TLC and updating.Due to the gorgeous setting against the ocean, the Kahala is a very popular wedding spot. It seemed like there was a wedding ceremony every ten minutes with wedding attendees circulating throughout the property. This was not an issue for us, but it did add to the hotel congestion and some guests might not enjoy the 24/7 nupitals being exchanged.For us, the Kahala was an escape from the frenetic craziness of Waikiki and delivered on our desire to end our vacation in peaceful surroundings with great food, terrific beach and great service. I believe this trip was the start of a family tradition and we look forward to our next visit. The hotel fits like a glove and we will be back.Many of you might be looking for hotel comparisons and most likely looking to compare Kahala to the new Four Seasons Ko'Olina because of price and rating. We would like to visit the new FS property, but we have not stayed there yet and cannot compare, so take this review with a grain of salt. I can share that if proximity to Waikiki is a goal, Kahala is likely a much better option. However, I don't think the two hotels really should be compared. The FS KO is a newer property located at least 30 minutes from Honolulu. I hear it is adjacent to the Disney resort and shares a lagoon with Disney, so I'd expect the beach is crowded, full of kids and maybe not quite as exclusive feeling as the beach at Kahala? For those considering the Halekulani vs Kahala...One, the Halekulani has a limited, very public beach, but is a gorgeous property in the heart of Waikiki....If you want five star in the middle of the craziness, go Halekulani...If you want to be one step removed, yet retain easy access to Waikiki shopping, my guidance would be Kahala.I hope you find this helpful...Happy Traveling and Aloha.",Austin,"BrentE740</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin</strong>",83,5.0

Absolutely everything was impeccable and luxurious, and I only brought relaxing clothes for this vacation. The staff made the entire family feel like rock stars though, and were always smiling and had good vibes. I can't say that enough.The property is a little secluded away from the hustle and bustle, which we really enjoyed. It is still close enough to shopping and food though, and we took advantage of that. I wish the parking structure accommodated more vehicles because it was full often times. The valet parking worked well though when it was full.The dolphin lagoon really added something special to the property. It was kind of magical passing by dolphins on our way to and from the beach and pool. It also has a very relaxing artificial waterfall near the lagoon. The beach was amazing-super clean and uncrowded with plenty of area to do whatever you wanted. There's even a reef where you can do some snorkeling. I do wish the pool was larger and deeper, but it certainly did the job and my kids never wanted to leave it. There's food and drinks by the pool-the food was great and the adult mixed drinks had very little alcohol in them.The toilet had a bidet on it, which made for funny first experience with one. I really wouldn't mind having one at home now. The rooms and the views also didn't disappoint. Huge king size bed and very large bathroom, that had a bath tub and shower. Our fridge was not very cold, but the room did come with free coffee via a Keurig.I'd give this resort a 10/10.

I chose the Kahala to avoid the busy Waikiki area and take advantage of the seclude beach and pool. My stay was exactly what this New Yorker needed to rest and relax in full luxury. Upon arrival, after my 12-hour flight, I was greeted with smiles, a cool towel, a lei and a speedy check in process. Surprisingly I was upgraded to a king room with an ocean view but what impressed me the most was my HUGE bathroom. The room was well appointed with an outstanding AC and circular fan, furnished balcony and a bed to die for. The entire resort was posh luxury at its finest. While staying I ate in the restaurant, drank at the bar, ordered lunch beachside, rented a cabana, ordered room service and even utilized the fitness center for an after check out/ post beach day shower. Waikiki was easily reached via taxi but what a joy it was to be on the calm side of Diamond Head surrounded by rainbows both day and evening. All the staff from the valets to the pool attendants were helpful, fast, and always greeted me with a warm smile. Special thanks to my beach server Jen for tending to my needs so diligently, to the wonderful gentleman who manages the valets and front entrance who so generously accompanied me to the fitness center and to my spectacular housekeeping staff who discovered my little travel mascot (a small token from my boyfriend) and placed it atop my turned down sheets at bedtime.","New York City, New York","gaill3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",7,5.0

The property was beautiful, the rooms were nicely appointed, and when we got up to our room after an 11-hour flight, we found a full bottle of champagne from concierge, which was very lovely. You could tell they pay a lot of attention to making their guests happy. We booked a standard room with breakfast included in the package, and I thought the breakfast buffet was delicious each morning - we ate on their outdoor patio area overlooking the beach. There is a Dolphin excursion on their property, and there were plenty of fish and sting rays swimming in other pools of water on their property. The service of the staff was also wonderful.

We spent 3 nights at The Kahala in a dolphin lagoon room. Great choice as we had our 5 year old daughter with us. Our room - 1123 - was on the ground floor and had a nice patio area right on the dolphin lagoon. The dolphin swam right by our patio throughout the day to our daughter's delight. We did check out the view from the tower rooms - and those views are exceptional. If we had been traveling as a couple (no kids) I would have preferred the tower rooms (higher the floor the better). The pool, though small, was really nice. The beach is so calm - perfect for little ones. This is the hotel you visit to totally relax and get away from it all while being a short distance from the action of waikiki. You can take a Lyft or Uber to the Kahala Mall which has a Whole Foods and other shops - about a $5 Lyft fee. There is a free shuttle to Waikiki but we found it more efficient to take a Lyft - about $12.

I'm not sure what other staff worked on our room, but it seemed like one person was assigned to us (Lino?) and greeted us by name the first morning. Brought plenty of water to us every day. I believe cleaning happens twice daily by default. One feels like royalty staying there, at least what I imagine about royalty.  Valet service was impeccable as well. Anything you need relating to transportation, they will try to accommodate. Excellent restaurants and service staff as well. If I had to find anything to complain about on the trip, it would be the strong winds during our visit (no fault of the hotel), no microwave oven in room, and the salt water pool seemed not particularly clean towards the end of our stay. However, very good by the pool drink bar and grill though, and the beach was really something.  That beach seems to be well isolated from the open ocean by shallow coral and rock formations surrounding the beach (see googlemaps), with the nearest inlet a good distance away on another beach.

Where to start.They treat you like royalty as soon as you arrive.The hotel is in a great area of housing all valued between 1m and 35m or so im told, it feels safe and sophisticated. It's not in Waikiki, it's in a quieter area and that's what appealed to us. They provide shuttle bus pretty frequently to certain areas including Waikiki and a taxi return is about 25dollars including tip so you don't feel isolated. Upon check in we were told that we had been upgraded to a room with a balcony which we were really pleased about as we love spending early evening with a glass of wine on the balcony.We went to the room and straight to the private beach. This was around 2pm and plenty of beds around the pool and on the beach. Standard beach beds are free and extremely comfortable. you can pay extra for bigger cabana beds if you wish. As you would expect the beach is beautiful and private not to busy or noisy just relaxing. The pool is heated and also have a outdoor jacuzzi this isn't a huge area but perfect for the size of the hotel. Upon returning to the room we had been left a bottle of Champagne and two glasses to wish us a happy honeymoon and they followed this up with a call to check we liked the Champaign and to ask if they could do anymore for us, class touch from a classy hotel and something we really appreciated. The room is very spacious, we had the mountain view which can be windy but still a beautiful view with a waterfall just below us.They provide a empty fridge that you can stock which is another classy touch instead of raiding you for evey penny with a mini bar like most hotels. Tea and coffee facilities also provided and replenished every day.The toilet well, it seemed to do more than my computer. I'll let you figure this one, reminded me of the ballagio fountains in Vegas.Maids are excellent and also provide a turn down service leaving chocolates and water in the evenings.We only visited one of the restaurants in the hotel but will review that separately as don't want anything to take away from what is a brilliant hotel.We did use the snack bar which was very good, a shame it wasn't open in the evening as it would have been lovely with the surroundings. Also you know your staying somewhere good when Pierce Brosnon is in the suite next door.They had weddings every day but they did not intrude on your stay and were not loud. In fact it was nice to see.This place just has class written all over it, is the only place we could imagine staying on the island. We are already saving for a return visit.

My wife, 5-month-old daughter and I had the pleasure of staying at the Kahala for 15 nights, and got to see it all. Final verdict: this hotel is amazing, and we feel very fortunate to have stayed at such a place for some much needed relaxation and luxury. Here are some recommendations:1. Room. The scenic view rooms are a fantastic deal, and the 'view' of Waialae Golf Course is perhaps even more special than that of the ocean (which is prominently featured in all the common areas/lobbies). My wife remarked on how the 'smallest' room here was quite huge in comparison to many other hotels; it was more than adequate for our entire stay. It was also quiet and well-insulated for sound, which was critical when trying to keep a baby asleep. I might also add that our room was immaculately maintained by the housekeeping staff who are as friendly as they are detail-oriented. 2. Food. The food in the restaurants is good, but if you're here for awhile and want some variety, nearby Kahala Mall (< 5 minute drive) offers a Whole Foods for groceries and several terrific takeout restaurants (e.g. GRYLT). Don't miss Sunday brunch at Hoku's though. My family (who lives here) said it was the best they've had on the island. 3. Beach. The water at the beach is very warm, thanks to the shallow reef offshore that both protects it from waves (making it very safe for swimming) and warms the ocean water naturally by the time it gets to shore. If you swim out to walk on the reef, be careful not to cut your feet. 4. Photos. Take advantage of the services by Pacific Dream Photography. They do a great job. It is a good way to capture memories of the trip that don't always exclude the camera person. The result can be pricey (the photo session is complementary, and you only pay for the photos you like) but worth it. 5. Parking. The self-parking often got full in the afternoon, and the only option was to valet park (mornings and evenings are more clear). Valet parking staff were very quick and professional. 6. Grounds. The lagoons filled with fish, stingrays and Dolphins offer a great place to spend early mornings for those with jet lag. And the free coffee in the lower lobby from 5:30-8:30 was great company on early morning strolls. As I observed each morning, the hotel staff work diligently to ensure that everything is perfect for hotel guests by the time they wake up (even taking care to rake up extra plumeria flowers that have fallen onto the lawn) and succeed every time. 7. Patrons. The guests at the Kahala were diverse - of all ages and from all over the world - but all very classy. Our friends who were staying in Waikiki remarked at how good looking all the people were at the Kahala. It's quite a crowd to be around. Big thanks to the Kahala team for making our much-needed holiday truly exceptional, and for being so warm. My mom mentioned that she liked that all the staff were such normal, local people that were just behaving naturally (she has lived here for all of her 70 years). We felt very welcome and comfortable here. Staying at your hotel could easily become a decadent habit that we hope to adopt.

It was far enough away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, and the nice sandy beaches, which were only a walk away, felt at times as secluded as a beach could get on busy Oahu. The Four Seasons on Oahu unfortunately is right next to the crowded Aulani Disney and shares a beach with them and diminished the feeling of seclusion and exclusivity that the Kahala exudes. The onsite Plumeria Lounge offered great ocean views while dining. There were plenty of amenities that also catered to families with children and my girls had a great time swimming with and feeding the Dolphins at the hotel through Dolphin Quest.

Love the architecture - open and spacious.We had a Dolphin room which also had a view of the breakers. Watching the dolphins every day was so much fun and interesting. The dolphin trainers are very friendly and spend a lot of time answering questions you might have about dolphins. I came away knowing much more about dolphins.The staff at the hotel were all so friendly and helpful. Lino, our housekeeper, was the best. The location of the hotel being in Kahala makes it so nice.

Only negative point is that they have some cabanas available on the beach, but you have to pay an extra to use it... Didn't understand the reason.Rooms are really comfortable and well decorated.

We choose Kahala because of the size of the rooms - a massive 51sqm. My husband has a very bad back and I was having medical treatment in Hawaii so we knew we might spend longer than average in our hotel room. It was important to have more space than you get in many Waikiki hotel rooms. We were in a Scenic View Lanai room on the 9th floor with a great view of the golf course and mountain. From the balcony we could look to our right and see the water.Service was great. The rooms were serviced twice a day and were spotless. The hotel has some nice food options - however you could end up spending a bit on meals here because you're not in easy distance of other (cheaper) dining options. We used the free shuttle to go to Kahala Mall (Wholefoods) to buy some breakfast supplies, snacks & paper plates (plus some free plastic cutlery) on our first day and it probably saved us $300 or more. There is a minibar size in the room that is empty - so plenty of space for your own supplies. Kahala Hotel also provides a shuttle to Waikiki several times a day. It's a set timetable with set drop off/collection points at Ala Moana and T Galleria (near the Royal Hawaiian) - I don't think I'd figured that out from my research before we got there. A cab ride back to the hotel from Waikiki is about $25.The swimming pool is very kid friendly and heated (which was weird), at it's deepest it was just over 4' deep. The beach is nice, but again it's very shallow for a long way out, like Waikiki. I thought Waikiki beach was nicer, to be honest, but Kahala is so much quieter. It was easy for us to find a couple of free beach loungers anytime we wandered down.I went to the hotel spa once and had a fabulous massage (thank you Raina!), but it is really expensive - undoubtedly the most expensive massage I have ever had.I was also pretty impressed with the gym. There was a good range of equipment and machines for a hotel.They even supply headsets, oranges and towels! There is a jacuzzi, steam room and sauna next to the gym but they are attached to the male and female changerooms. The hotels has daily displays of the dolphins doing tricks and it didn't get tired. At any time of day you can see them swimming around in the lagoon.So even though this was not a cheap resort and the pool/dolphins etc are more kid friendly than a typical couples-style holiday, the size and cleanliness of the room and the welcome we received from the Kahala staff left us with a strong warm impression - we would definitely return to this hotel.",Sydney,"KJ74Sydney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",24,5.0

The watercloset (toilet) is super small there is not even a trash can in there however they have put in those toilet seats that warm up ( im pretty sure thats where all the hot water is routed too ) its motion activated and i swear its more accurate the the motion detectors on some alarms..Food & Beverageok so the food is outrageously overpriced even for hawaii standards..

The food was almost all top notch. We had a breakfast buffet included and let me tell you, it is some of the best food we had our entire trip. We also had lunch and dinner at Plumeria and pool side, both great. We did eat at Hoku's which is their fine dining restaurant, and it was just ok. Some of the most fun was sitting in the lobby area at night and listening to the live music and eating heavy appetizers and having drinks. The staff is what makes this resort stand out. You meet employees that have worked here for decades and you can tell that they love what they do. There are nice touches throughout the hotel...coffee each morning, flavored water poolside, etc... If you leave for the day, the valet always offers towels and water to go. We considered Trump, Halekulani, and Turtle Bay. Turtle Bay is in a neat area (north shore), but was dirty and looked like a Holiday Inn. Trump is not on the beach, and Halekulani was nice for drinks but too crowded.

This was our first trip to Oahu, and I did quite a bit of research before deciding on the Kahala. I was curious to see Waikiki, but I didn't think I wanted to be right in the hustle and bustle. I'm not a city person (although I live in LA), and when I go to Hawaii it's not because I want to be around fancy shopping, high rises and crowds. So I chose the Kahala to be in a quieter area, and I'm so glad I did. It's a beautiful resort with excellent service, and an understated elegance.The day we went to Waikiki we visited the Moana Surfrider, Royal Hawaiian, Halekulani, and Sheraton. I was so glad not to be staying at any of those hotels. If you're not into noise and crowds, and a Vegas-like atmosphere, definitely check out the Kahala.One day we drove up to the North Shore, which I loved, but the Turtle Bay Resort was a disappointment to me. I was surprised that it lacked elegance. Seeing it made me very glad again that we had chosen the Kahala.Before we arrived, I read on TA that the ocean view rooms looked out over the parking structure, so I requested a high-level floor. They accommodated that request, and also let us take a look at the ocean front rooms, which are on the other side of the property, away from the parking structure. There was a significant increase in price for the ocean front side, so we decided to stay with the ocean view lanai room. We were on the 9th floor, which definitely helped provide a nicer view, but the driveway and parking structure was definitely in sight. I still loved the lanai and the view, though.

We booked two rooms, both scenic lanai and both were in the Diamond Head Tower. One was on the second floor and the other, the ninth. Both had simply stunning golf course and mountain views, especially when looking east to see the early morning sunrise. The rooms were spacious and luxurious with comfortable beds, more than ample closet space and huge bathrooms. Room service twice daily along with turn down service in the evenings. Bedside slippers along with complimentary bottles of water and dark chocolate square was a nice touch. Resort amenities were simply outstanding. The pool area was not overcrowded during our stay and we never had to wait for a chaise lounge either there or on their private beach. We rented a full size cabana tent two of the days and loved it. The Dolphins on property were a special treat and two of our group participated in the Dolphin Quest program there. It was simply fantastic. The staff there cares deeply for these beautiful animals and it shows. They also house live sea turtles there but there were none during our stay... they were recently released into the sea after growing to the appropriate size on site. They will be replaced soon... We especially enjoyed the breakfast buffet at the Plumeria Beach House every morning. The buffet selection was enormous and of very high quality. Those thin pancakes are to die for... Randy tended our table most days and he was exceptional. He gave us a lot of local information and we got to know him quite well during our stay. Other staff members that were VERY helpful during our stay and deserve special mention include Cameron and Leimomi at the concierge desk, Betel who greeted us upon arrival and gave us an introduction to the Kahala and the entire valet team in front who had our car waiting for us each and every time when requested.

The room was large and the view was pleasant, overlooking the golf course looking toward the mountains. This time, traveling with our college student daughter and my mother, we booked a Scenic View room AND a dolphin lagoon room. My mother and daughter gor a room on the second floor of the dolphin lagoon wing with killer views of both the dolphin habitat AND the ocean beyond. The Resort kindly gave us a room only a few doors down the hall; it was apparently still in the Scenic View category but we had a beautiful golf course view and, stepping out onto our micro-balcony (not really a lanai but just big enough to stand outside), you could make out an ocean view in the distance. See the photos below to get a sense of the views we had in each room.Both rooms were quite large and very comfortable, with extra chairs, a desk, separate tub and shower, dual sinks, dual closets, fridge and coffee maker. The dolphin lagoon room proved to be a huge hit with both my daughter and mother. They spent hours sitting on the large lanai and watching the dolphins. They could see the dolphins, trainers and guests sometimes participating in one of the ""dolphin encounters."" But they also just watched the dolphins swim lazily around, be fed and groomed, etc. Literally, hours of amusement.The staff was amazing as always. Every one of them had a cheerful and helpful attitude. We pre-purchased full breakfasts at Plumeria every morning, as this was a highlight of our last stay at the Resort. I consider the breakfast buffet there to be one of the best such buffets I've ever eaten at, with full American-style and Japanese-style offerings, including omelette station, wonderful tropical fruit selections, island specialties such as macadamia nut pancakes, Okinawan taro/tapioca soup, etc. And virtually every table has the most beautiful and relaxing ocean view.The Kahala is definitely pricey but get on their email list for the regular specials they offer. If you are able to plan ahead, they offer packages with percentage-off discounts and breakfast included. We also took advantage of the senior discount since my mother was one of the guests this time.Final bonus tip: when we checked in, we were handed a card that mentioned a professional photography company called Pacific Dream was offering a beach portrait session with no sitting fee. Even though we were not prepared for formal portraits (our outfits did not match color-wise), we went ahead and scheduled an appointment for the next day at sunset. Our photographer Julia was such a delight to work with, really putting all of us at ease. She took us to a few different spots within an easy walk from the main building and patiently shot a couple hundred images in every combination of the four of us. She even snuck in some videos and candid shots without our awareness. The next morning, we had our viewing appointment. No hard sell at all, but after seeing the absolutely gorgeous images she captured of us, we ended up buying a package. We will treasure these photos as a wonderful keepsake of our Hawaiian vacation. We can't say enough good things about Pacific Dream and Julia. You should really take advantage of the free session offered and consider packing some color-coordinated outfits. But even if you were not expecting to sit for formal portraits, the stunning ocean and tropical backdrops, together with professional photography, can make anyone look good.","Culver City, California","traveldan21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Culver City, California</strong>",239,5.0

Two years ago what we found disappointing was the buffet breakfast ie the lack of options and variety, and two years on it's just as disappointing but we were smart enough this time to not bother adding it.Having been lucky enough to have warm beautiful weather for our 5 days it was odd to find the pool is heated and pumping hot water in al day, so it is like getting in a warm bath and far from refreshing.The service through out the resort is exceptional other than the pool area. We would be asked if we wanted a menu to order food or drinks, then most times no one would come back and after 30 mins we'd simply go to the pool bar and place our order, which was a little disappointing.It's also a shame 5 star resorts still allow people to come to the pool at 8am, place towels on half the chairs and then turn back up around 11am.The rooms and immaculate and the cleaning team are wonderful.The views from the ocean view suite are amazing as you would expect however we were towards the end of the building above the entrance to the hotel so constantly and into the evening you hear the loud beeping of the shuttle/bus reversing into it's parking spot which was annoying.The Plumeria restaurant does a ""wonder of the 7 seas"" buffet on Friday and Saturday nights, as advertised in their lifts and online it's called the ""the best of Kahala buffet. I was somewhat disappointing and certainly not worth the money. As I said there are many positives and it's a great places for families, however it's a shame The Kahala isn't as good as the price tag demands it to be.I think in 2017 we'll go elsewhere.","Sydney, Australia","444Scott444</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",334,4.0

I have visited Hawaii (Big Island, Maui, Kauai, Oahu) annually since my first trip, so easily 9 times and I finally got back to the Kahala last April (I know this review is late). I have stayed at many great hotels in Hawaii (many I have reviewed) and several on Oahu, the Kahala just beats them all. As I mentioned, I first stayed here in 2005 and when we checked in, they still had my profile on record which surprised me. Because of this, we were upgraded to a partial-ocean view room on the 9th floor when we booked a mountain view room. We were given fresh leis, juice and my daughter a nice stuffed turtle animal with the Kahala Hotel insignia. We were booked for 4 nights, and after spending 4 nights prior at the Andaz Maui which was nice but the decor was in stark contrast to the Kahala. While nice, Andaz Maui is very modern and there is something to be said for a large 500+ square foot room with plush carpet and a deep soaking tub. In general, even though the Kahala is an older hotel, it was just more comfortable for us as a family.The only negative aspect of the hotel is the pool. After staying at the Andaz with their multi-level of pools, the Kahala needs to redo the pool area. While many love the Dolphins, it is also a point of contention for animal rights activist. My daughter loved them, but if they got rid of the dolphins, the pool area could be expanded. Although not a deal breaker by any means, it's just not a relaxing area as all the guest from kids to adults are forced to use this little pool area. At the very least, the beach is close and it's perfect for kids.The Kahala is the perfect hotel on Oahu - it's close to Waikiki but far enough from all the hustle and bustle.

We had an issue with the beds in our family room and despite many assurances from reception, this was finally resolved on the third night when I complained to the hotel manager which resulted in him physically bringing another bed to our room himself! Not really the service you'd expect from a 5* hotel.Most of the staff were friendly and attentive although as highlighted above, not always terribly efficient. The hotel itself is well known for its impressive past guests, including monarchy, presidents and A List celebrities which I found a little surprising - it just didn't seem plush enough.The restaurants were nice but expensive and breakfast in the Plumeria was lovely - the only disappointment was the awful bar area in the hotel. Staying in Hawaii, we expected to be sitting outside listening to the ocean as we had a last drink before bed, but the only bar open after dinner was a massive brightly lit room with high ceilings and a few large tables and uncomfortable chairs dotted around - we couldn't believe there was nowhere cosy or romantic to go to after dinner.Our daughter loved the dolphin experience and the secluded and private beach was simply beautiful.

We had a room on the 8th floor with a beautiful ocean view. The pool is small, but nice and did not seem crowded. You can tell that the property needs some touching-up with missing tiles in the pool, an underwater light fixture hanging out of its fixture, worn hallway carpeting, etc., but that is pretty nit-picky.

The customer service overall was adequate, not overly friendly or attentive compared to other hotels we stayed at in the same category.

You feel like royalty each time you interact with them.Everything in Hawaii is expensive, and my only minor complaint about the Kahala is the price of food on site. There are many, many dining options on site, but none are what I would consider budget friendly.The resort itself is at the end of a private lane - very secluded. Private beach, dolphin lagoon on site, spacious rooms, great views. Nothing about the property is out of place. Care is taken to each need. Twice a day housekeeping - bottled water in your room each day, as well as at valet. Beach towels, umbrellas, sunscreen, all available to you as you need, whether you're staying on property or not.If you're into the constant traffic of people, automobiles, and long lines for restaurants, stay near Waikiki.

The grounds are spectacular, with exotic plants, beautiful flowers andwaterways teeming with aquatic life. This includes performances of jumping dolphins, turtles and many types of exotic fish. The Kahala has one of the most lovely, serene and quiet beaches in all of Oahu adjacent to a magnificent blue ocean. The ambiance is quiet elegance throughout the hotel, especially in the lobby. The restaurants have excellent food and the staff are engaging, friendly and ready to serve. The rooms are charming with beautiful views of the ocean.

Our plans for this trip, October 21-28 began in 1976 on our honeymoon. During our honeymoon stay (76) in the Waikiki area, we had plans for dinner at the Kahala Hotel. We sat down for dinner and the waiter brought menus. My husband took one look at the prices and immediately left me by myself at the table. I too got up and left with apologies to the waiter.This was our first big disagreement. It was the beginning of a Promise made by my husband to return to the Kahala. It only took 39 years. On our honeymoon in 1976, we had lost all our pictures due to a camera malfunction. While celebrating our 39th anniversary in 2015, we met Julia Jump, Creative Director of Pacific Dream Photography. The hotel offers her services from her photo studio in the lower level of the hotel. We spent part of an afternoon and evening with Julia moving throughout the Resort, taking pictures. Surprising to us, without our knowledge, Julia was also creating an amazing video. The entire photo/video package was then put to music and the result was a great joy to us. These photos reduced much of our disappointment from the loss of our honeymoon pictures. However, a Promise 39 years ago was fulfilled.  We would love to return to the Kahala.

The day we arrived, there were two weddings and a funeral, so it was absolute chaos, but once we'd got through the front entrance and up to the reception desk all was calm. I was worried that we'd have a lot of noise but our room was very quiet as it was right on the beach at the end of the hotel. The long walk to our room was so worth it. It was a fabulous room, the only problem being the very noisy air conditioning unit. In the end, the only way to resolve the noise was to leave in on ""on"" rather than automatic and turn it slightly up so that it didn't cut in and out all night long. Hoku's Brunch on a Sunday is a must, with a huge selection of foods to try and for an extra few dollars you can get a glass of champagne with two complimentary top ups! Yum.

We spent the first half of our trip at Disney Aulani and the second half on Maui. We returned to Oahu for one night before leaving Hawaii solely so my 7-year-old daughter could swim with the dolphins at Dolphin Quest, which is located at the Kahala Resort. We had booked a one bedroom with an ocean view lanai several months prior to our trip. However, when we arrived, there were no such rooms available. While they offered to upgrade us to another room, we would have had to pay the difference in room rates. We ended up downgrading to an ocean view without a lanai which was fine for one night, but honestly I think they should have offered us the upgraded room at no charge since the room we had booked was not available.The resort is nice but slightly dated. Our room was spacious, but the beds are fulls rather than queens so they were a bit small. The beds, however, were very comfortable and the bedding was upscale. The bathroom was very spacious with a walk-in shower, large spa bath and 2 sinks. The toilet had a heated seat and bidet functions (don't ask) which my kids got endless amusement from.

We were given a map but got lost half way and ended up asking a member of housekeeping in one of the corridors who gave us more directions. Lovely welcoming gifts for the kids and pre-requested items waiting for us in the room.All staff were friendly, welcoming and remembered our preferences after the first meeting. This was especially true of the lounge bar staff. We stayed in a ground floor dolphin lagoon room which was fabulous for meeting the dolphins. Each morning they would be swimming immediately outside our room and on several occasions stopped by to allow our kids a short pat on the head. We got some great photos. Whilst generally a very positive experience, the hotel looks tired in parts - sunbeds that have seen better days, furniture that needs replacing, a fresh coat of paint required here and there, old wallpaper peeling off in some places. It gave the impression that it had been left to deteriorate over time and was a bit 'lost in time'. I hope the new owners are ready to invest money in the hotel and return it to the grandeur I'm sure it once was.

On return, someone else was sitting there, and my stuff was gone! My friend went over to the little kiosk and some attendant say ""hmmm, your name was crossed out"" (probably someone took a tip and decided it was easy to just remove a name from the list). When I went to the kiosk to ask for my lost bad, the guy said ""oh, we have it here"" - so they removed my bag, then gave the cabana I reserved to someone else. When I ask the guy to fix it, he gave me royal face like I WAS THE ONE AT FAULT.- about the ""preferred seating at Plumeria"" - forget it!

We were here for 3 nights during Spring Break, with our kids ages 9 and 11. Both a friend who has been to Hawaii many times, and my cousin who works in travel and use to live on Oahu, said this is the only place they would ever recommend staying. Below is a list of what we loved (both adults and kids voted):1. Location: a few miles away from the craziness of Waikiki and at the end of a nice neighborhood, isolated on it's own. Easy taxi or drive in to town if you were looking for other dinner options and shopping.2. Smaller resort, not your big luxury chain hotel. I like both, but what made The Kahala special was you got to meet other guests, and you got to know the staff. The pool is small, but we never had an issue getting a chair at the pool or on the beach. There was always someone to assist you with a chair covers and towels.3. The Service!! Everyone from the activities staff, poolside assistance, bellmen, bartenders, were just great. Special Shout Out to Anji our poolside bartender. Not only was she genuinely friendly but also gave helpful tips on getting around the island. Super great with my kids too. 4. We are suckers for a breakfast buffet....with a view. Get a package that includes it (which we did). A beautiful way to start the day.5. Prior to my trip, I worked with the concierge service to book tours and make dinner reservations. At work, it's often difficult to take personal calls, so I dealt with them mostly via email. I got quick responses, all questions answered, and ended up loving what they booked for us. 6. My family loved the TOTO toilets in our bathrooms. Seriously, they talked for days about getting them at home. Heated seats, self cleaning, multiple spray options.....what's not to love.The only thing I didn't like is that the rooms show their age a bit. You can tell it's an older building that's been renovated. That said, we had a suite and both rooms were of great size with two full bathrooms with showers, tubs, TOTO toilets per above, closets, etc. Our kids are getting a bit older and next time I might consider two connecting rooms or a larger suite. The pull-out sofa bed was really just a full-size, not a queen. Honestly, we were never in our room because we enjoyed hanging out at the pool so much.

Arrival was great, nice lobby, welcoming staff. The expedia silver status upgrade got us a room with a balcony (i booked the scenic view rooms, assuming all the rooms at a 5 star hotel would be ok). Room decor was tired, scenic view was of a golf course and noisy freeway, very much like an Indian casino in the central valley). after much discussion with staff, they segued (not an upgrade as same price range) us into a dolphin lagoon room. sounds great but the nicer dolphin lagoon rooms are ""out of commission"" for remodelling and my room is overshadowed by the supports & service area of the main tower. the room is damp and the bathroom smells like skunk (are there even skunks in Hawaii?). I spoke to management again (a Belgian chap) and again, the nicer rooms, although unoccupied, are available for a less than modest fee. I truly wanted to love this hotel but all the issues (no one told me there was a gym, there's coffee in the mornings, yoga, beach bar wait staff just ignore you being a few)are being compounded into an overall unsatisfying experience. I have a couple of days left to make my wife's birthday a happy one and i sadly feel the Kahala is not going to be able to make that happy. Carlos at reception is exceptional though, Clinton the shuttle driver and Todd the bellman is as well.

The grass also looks like they've stopped using fertilizer; it's brown in many places and pale green at best. There's leaves and other organic debris under the plantings that should be removed. I could go on.Part of the story of the sale was that they would develop time-shares. It will be tough to sell a share to someone the way the grounds look now.

I used to live in Honolulu so it is very familiar to me. Of course living in a place offers a very different experience than being a tourist. Yet in Hawaii it can be difficult to not cross paths quite often. The Kahala is truly a very special place, and not only because of its very special location. It is situated in such a way that there are no other hotels anywhere around. The Kahala area of Honolulu has long been one of the most exclusive parts of Honolulu. The hotel is directly on its own beach. It is surrounded by the most impressive Waialae Country Club & Golf Course so all the surrounding area is really beautiful. If you don't happen to get an ocean view the golf course and mountains are are a nice vista as well. From the many times we have stayed there I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience. But then I tend to be kind and empathetic when requesting service.Another exclusive to my knowledge that the resort offers is the resident dolphins. They have several in their lagoon and you and get in the water and have your picture taken with them. This is a really big hit with the kids believe me. It is always busy.This property is not new, but it is maintained in pristine condition, and I tend to be on the picky side. I even walk around outside the perimeter of the hotel where guests don't venture and just look to see how those places are kept. Even the service dock is clean and organized. If you don't want a rental car they offer a very convenient shuttle service to the local shopping mall and the tourist ghetto of Waikiki, if you wish to go. The mall is highly recommended, and I think you know my opinion of Waikiki. In summary this is the place for you if you have the means. I might mention that many famous celebrities choose to stay here, and we have seen several in previous trips. One wall in the shopping arcade has many of their pictures taken while staying here. From Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra to more recent musicians, movie stars, and politicians including former US Presidents.","Cabo San Lucas, Mexico","Pyotr S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</strong>",35,5.0

It's clear this is an old hotel that's been refurbished with likely most focus on aesthetics. 2. We weren't that close to the hotel deliveries area but we could hear delivery trucks readily. This was frequent and at all times of the day. The particular kind of noise is those was refrigerated trucks which park to unload but keep their engine running all the time they are there.

We were not disappointed. This is a very classy place. Though it doesn't have a dress code, the clientele seem to know to dress well, and to expect old-fashioned service. The concierges began by helping us with arrangements well before our arrival. Our room (dolphin lanai) was large, with a huge bathroom and double sinks, plus a fancy Japanese toilet. The toilet made us laugh, as it felt a bit like having a pet. There was true turndown service, beautiful views, and even a sort of mini-zoo on the property (rays, turtles, fish in addition to dolphins). We loved watching the dolphins from our balcony! All of the on-site restaurants are quite good. Expensive, but that's to be expected in Hawaii. But what really made the difference for us was the outstanding level of service. Without exception, everyone we encountered at The Kahala was extraordinarily friendly, helpful, and competent. Couldn't be happier with our experience. Tips: there is a sheltered, uncrowded beach. If you watch carefully during whale season, you may see whales breach from here. The neighborhood is a bit outside of Waikiki, so if you want to wander the streets and shop, this is not the place. It is in an upscale residential neighborhood (""The Beverly Hills of Honolulu""). There is onsite parking. The hotel seemed to be a popular wedding destination for Chinese guests, which was beautiful to watch.

When we arrived, I felt like we were treated as if we were royalty.........it felt nice. Valet staff were my fav's including the ones that stand behind the counter when you pull up. If you need anything ask them! Every day they gave us towels if we were going to another beach & bottled water. They asked how our day was and when we'd leave they gave us great suggestions if we didn't have plans. All of the staff was GREAT! Check-in went so fast. And shocker, we got a free upgrade to ocean view and WOW what a big room. 2 mornings in a row we saw whales jumping from our hotel window. We had a refrigerator. We got bottled water everyday & chocolates. Loved the bathroom. Check-out we learned something new, they have a hospitality room for those of us with late flights. We could stay at the resort all day and go in there to shower, lay down on a couch that was in a room and nap, 2 desktop computers, or just lounge in a comfy chair and watch tv. I've never had this offer at any hotel.The Dolphins to visit every day was very enjoyable.Our kids went to the Keiki Club 2 times and they LOVED it! They made lots of crafts and got a t-shirt each time. And the staff made sure to reapply sunblock on the kids.Pool area, yeah it needs upgraded but I'd prefer to have the heated pool to enjoy instead of it being closed........just saying. The beach is nice and quiet, not high tide. BADS:Restaurants.........Too Pricey........we ate here 1 time during our 8 night stay $125 by the pool and not worth it. Yes the resort is high priced, but I am not gonna spend $200 per meal for my family of 4. And yes even for breakfast which I thought was unheard of. I will say what I saw at the buffet for sushi lovers was well worth the $ but our girl can't stand any fish & there was no substitute foods for her. This is my only reason I would not stay here again. I'm just the type that can find better use with that amount of money. Be careful about parking your car rental........the cost is to be $30 something a day and we looked at a receipt and it was $206 for 1 day. The hotel took it off our bill and then told us what to do with our parking ticket. I wish we were told that ahead of time. Pillows looked elegant just not my type on comfort. And I knew they were full size beds but I wish more resorts would offer queen beds. Summary:It's an elegant place to stay away from the hustle. Be prepared to spend a lot of money on food.","Madison, Alabama","Carrie0693</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Madison, Alabama</strong>",148,4.0

When I was there 13 years ago, it was the Mandarin Oriental. I was surprised the hotel has not changed much at all in terms of appearance and renovations. I love the traditional Hawaiian theme and there is something very Don Draper/Mad Men about this hotel. It is like stepping back in time a little bit. It could definitely use some polishing up, though. The pool tiles are worn and there are signs of wear and tear here and there, but all in all, nothing major. The service has gone down a notch since my last visit, although overall it we were pretty well taken care of. We reserved a Dolphin Lanai room and were pleasantly surprised at the size and comfort of the room...until it was time to go to sleep. There was a repetitive noise coming from the water pipes that kept us up all night long. When we first called the desk they sent an engineer to take care of it who made it clear he was not there to listen to our complaints of sleep deprivation and told us to talk to the front desk about that. We inquired at the front desk about changing rooms, because, well at $600 a night, you should get a good night's sleep. We were told we would have to change rooms twice if they relocated us. With a little nudging from me, my husband contacted the night manager who was able to put us into a suite. The new room was very nice and we were very comfortable for the remainder of our stay, however we missed having a lanai. The breakfast buffet at the Plumeria was great. The room package we chose had it included, so we did eat there every morning. We also ate at the Veranda and at the poolside restaurant. The service at the pool was surprisingly good. We reserved a lounge chair with the shade and they were quick to come around when we raised the umbrella. We also sat at one of their tables once and had a great chat with our server while we sipped on mai tais and enjoyed a small snack. The Veranda was fun. There were some cute couples dancing and we enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere there. On Valentine's day we had reservations at Hoku. I had seen the menu ahead of time and noticed there was only red meat options for an entrée and requested a seafood substitution for myself. They noted it and had it available. The reservation was hard to get and they made it sound like it was going to be an unforgettable dining experience. However, I was SUPER disappointed that it was the exact same dish I had the previous night at the Veranda, their casual dining spot. Not only that, but the fish tasted like it had been sitting in a buffet dish for a while. It was dry and tasted like it had been cooked in mass quantities. I wasn't surprised to see the same fish show up the next morning at the buffet. The overall Valentine's dinner experience was disappointing, even aside from the seafood dish. Especially for the price they charged for the holiday meal, it simply was not worth it. The best feature of this hotel by far is it's location and pristine beach. It's away from the Waikiki scene, but not to far that you can't run to Duke's for a sunset cocktail. One of the best things we did while at the Kahala was to schedule a photography session with Pacific Dream Photography. They are located on site and the session is free. We thought we would have one or two photos that we would like but we ended up with over a hundred that we fell in love with. Loryn was so great to work with and she is an extremely talented photographer. Overall, everything was overpriced at the hotel, but we had a great time spoiling ourselves. I would have given five stars in my rating but for the Hoku dining experience.","Livermore, California","islandfix</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Livermore, California</strong>",77,4.0

There are plenty of ways to relax: pool, beautiful beach, bar, several oceanfront restaurants, spa, outdoor yoga classes, soothing ocean views featuring sunrises and sunsets!We highly recommend staying in the Dolphin Lagoon Wing - we had a beautiful view which included the ocean and we really enjoyed watching the dolphins and their caregivers work their magic all day long. This included shows and popular tourist ""encounters"" but also vet services and general training. Our room was lovely, clean, and had plenty of storage space. There is a waterfall nearby and we enjoyed its calming sound.The hotel's Hoku restaurant (named for the youngest dolphin, born here) is fantastic, with a great Pris Fixe option. We hit the best restaurants around and this was high on the list. After dinners, we'd relax in the Veranda where an excellent pianist entertained nightly. We also recommend getting the breakfast-included package - a great buffet with many choices (including breakfast for Japanese and European guests) that will save your having to leave the hotel. There are no nearby options. Ask for availability of other packages which will save you money.All around, a wonderful place to stay - the perfect place to experience Oahu. We can't wait to go back!Tips: we rented a car for getting around the island but took cabs to and from dinners in Waikiki (average $25 plus tip each way).

The variety of views were special. Out of our bedroom, we could see mountains and the Waialae golf course.Out on the substantial sized balcony we overlooked the lagoon with the dolphins and a great ocean view. Oddly, the living room which had one wall facing the lagoon and ocean only had a very small window facing the ocean. Not sure why the view was not captured by a larger window. The suite had two large bathrooms each complete with stall showers, bathtubs and large closet space. The décor was nice and the suite was quite spacious. The suite contained heated toilets which hissed like snakes every time you approached them. The hot water took quite a long time to heat up in both showers so that was annoying. The cable tv reception in both rooms had little synapses which was also quite annoying. The grounds are really beautiful with a lovely beach and protected shore line so you can swim or walk along the beach without the huge pacific waves. The breakfast buffet was quite good in a lovely setting and was included with our rate except for expresso drinks which were over $7 with tax. We are always annoyed and mystified by the extra expresso charge. Similarly, there was free wifi which had a very weak signal. They offered high speed internet for an absurd cost of $20 a day. Again, when you are playing huge daily room rates, the nickel and diming for expresso drinks and high speed internet are totally annoying. One other annoying thing is the hotel's relationship with the private Waialae Country Club which literally adjoins the property. You can play tennis at the Waialae for the significant sum of $62 for one hour of court time but the hotel has no access to the Waialae's Championship golf course ( home of the Sony Open).The hotel has dolphins ( including a dolphin quest), sea turtles and sting rays which are very special, beautiful and exciting. They have a fascinating photo gallery off the lobby including photos of many famous guests that have stayed there and it is well worth looking at. The hotel is in the beautiful Kahala neighborhood which is worth walking around. It is close to Diamondhead and to the Doris Duke home in Kahala which is absolutely spectacular. Unfortunately, you have to go to the Honolulu Museum of Art to take a shuttle bus to the Duke home but it is well worth doing. The staff was excellent. We would definitely return.

I recently went back to dine at Hoku's but since it was closed for lunch got a bite to eat at Plumeria Beach House instead. Brought back some good memories.The location of the resort is completely different than anything in Waikiki. Deep in high end residential area of Kahala, it's a good 20 minutes away by car to Waikiki. The oceanfront space is superior than Royal Hawaiian due to there being less crowds. If you enjoy lounging on the sand for hours on your vacation, this is the space for you. Of course being from LA I still prefer Manhattan Beach for that.The decor and rooms itself is what really gives the hotel 4 instead of 5 stars. The decor is nice but there are areas that are simply too dated. The black aluminum framed window in the lobby, the furniture looking like it could use an updating, the toilet in the restaurant was unfit for a high end resort. I looked at several rooms in the hotel before settling on one. The front desk staff was wonderful as they accommodated my request for a room change without any hint of resistance. The rooms were all fairly mediocre to be perfectly honestly. The layouts were a little strange as well like a remodel gone a smidgen wrong. However when night time comes staying at this property is wonderful. They have live music in the lobby piano bar, great seafood tower at Hoku's, and calm & peaceful waterfront to just sit at and listen to the waves. It is a complete 180 versus the drunken shenanigans of Waikiki. Sleep is also great as it's perfectly quiet here nestled in between a golf course, the ocean, and the high end Kahala neighborhood.Great place to be and I hope the owners improve upon their gem of a hotel in the coming years. Hire a great GM, really nail down the nitty gritties, and turn this hotel into the 5-star hotel I know that it can be.","Los Angeles, California","Peter H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",9,4.0

I've stayed at this property many times over the years, ever since it was The Kahala Hilton. I recently stayed two nights, out of nostalgia mainly, and was delighted. The property looks absolutely terrific and the people were, without exception during my visit, were the most friendly and welcoming I've ever had. (It was great to see Bob again at Hoku's!)I booked a mountainside room with lanai for old times sake, since that is the type of room I used to get years ago before graduating to ocean views and suites. The mountainside view is beautiful, and the Sony Open golf tournament was going on just below my balcony at the country club that adjoins the back of the hotel.The grand hotel lobby is stunning and peaceful, the hotel grounds and rooms updated, rooms clean with every amenity.The only surprising downside - and I didn't expect this at all- is that I didn't sleep well. I didn't find the bed or pillows as comfortable as I would have liked. I first thought that maybe I was just having an off couple of nights, but when I switched over to Halekulani for 6 more nights to join friends I slept incredibly well and peacefully. The super comfy bedding at Halekulani (also a wonderful hotel but in need of some refurbishment soon - see my recent review) was the only area The Kahala disappointed. One quibble about the room: They place a small, heavy, round black table in the middle of the room. After tripping over it in the dark twice (ouch!) I placed it against a wall. You can see it in the room photo I have attached to this review. I recommend they remove them or place them elsewhere.Plumeria Beach House has an absolutely amazing buffet on some evenings of the week. My friends and I tried it during our stay at Halekulani and we were all greatly impressed. In fact, looking back we all named it the highlight of our trip.",,Alan L,191,5.0

Sadly, it's the only thing I remember about liking this hotel.The location is not in an area that offers much off property. I would say this is definitely more for tourist not wanting a local flair.

We love the isolation of the hotel and that it is apart from the busy-ness of Waikiki--if you want to be in the heart of the action in Waikiki there is plenty to choose from there. We love the beach at the Kahala and although the pool is nice, we gravitate to the quieter peaceful beach area.We have never been disappointed in the location of our room, and choices range from several hi-rise rooms with/without lanais to our favorite beach-front rooms. Sometimes it has taken some juggling at check-in, but Carlos the Assistant Manager has come to know us, and always seems to get us into the perfect room. The rooms we have inhabited have always been nicely appointed, comfortable, with spacious bathrooms and comfortable beds. I have read comments that the hotel is in need of updating, but I have noted that the Halekulani in downtown Honolulu (which would be a comparable hotel) has similar criticisms in its reviews. Maybe its the service, the warmth of the employees, and the overall ""Aloha"" spirit"" of the Kahala, but I never notice the imperfections since the positives outweigh them. Breakfast is delicious and we also enjoy Hoku as well as having a pre-dinner cocktail in the verandah. Housekeeping employees, the valet staff (always addressing us by name), desk staff stand out in my mind as always being friendly and accommodating. We check-out right before the start of the Sony Open, which I know can be a busy time at the Kahala--but I have no complaints about attention to our needs during our time of stay.

Call it a splurge. It's the only hotel that is away from the business of Waikiki.  I never valet parked in my entire life, yet this was one of the best parts of the hotel. The cost difference between valet and self park is not much at all. Aside from this being a fabulous architectural structure, the rooms are fabulous.They have those high tech toilets that you'd probably find in Japan. The service here went above and beyond! Thank you to the management and housekeeping for making my stay here fabulous. I left the day before my birthday but they still left this fabulous red velvet birthday cake for me :) The valet parking helped as well by lending us towels to go to the beach.

The beach cafe is a little more casual than Plumeria, but both provide great menus! Please note that they do not have the chip card technology for payments with a credit card, so don't panic when they take the card away to get processed. Beach:I am not a huge fan of crowds and Kahala beach is perfect for that reason. Pools:There aren't huge pools here, but one main one, a hot tub and a kiddie pool. *note that for the beach and pool you can order food from the sea side cafe! Please don't be overwhelmed by the grand stature of the hotel, the staff are so friendly, not pretentious, and very helpful.EntertainmentIn the evening there is live music at The Verandah, open air near the lobby. I was here several years ago and the set up of The Verandah was different, I preferred it back then, it seemed more lounge like, now there are tables and chairs and seems to be a different configuration of the band.

We were on our honeymoon and wanted the peace and tranquility that the Kahala had to offer. After reading so many positive reviews and searching the island for a hotel we decided on the Kahala. And we were not disappointed. When we first arrived late into the evening, we were not thrilled with how indifferent the 2 male staff were that greeted us after we found the odd location for the front desk. It's not what you'd expect for such a fine resort. Kind of tucked away from the big lobby area. The 2 young men were in no hurry to help us as one of them was busy on his cell phone chatting with a friend. The other man really didn't seem to care we had asked for a room (several weeks in advance) that was from any elevators, pop machines, or maid service stations. We asked for a room that was on an upper floor away from any noise and my husband wanted to see the room before we checked in. So we went and looked at the room he offered (which I think was on the 6th floor) and we looked at it, it was not what we expected. Pretty much a basic room with a view towards the golf course and the truck loading/unloading area. It was also too close to the elevators so not what we asked for when we made our reservation. We had also called before we left home to make sure we got what we had asked for. Since these 2 men at the front desk were not too helpful and didn't really seem to care what we wanted, they seemed to just want us checked in so we would not disrupt their phone calls and their own visiting time with one another. When we went back down to the front desk and asked to view another room that was more to our liking, they acted like we were making trouble for them and just wanted us out of their hair. Since they said the hotel was full they only had one other room to show us (I think it was on the 9th floor) so we went and looked at that and decided to just take it. Even though it was pretty much the same room as the one on the 6th, we took it as it was after 9:00 then and we were very tired after all our travels from the mainland. But during the night, the toilet kept running, there were the sounds of the elevator that kept going, and the trucks made a lot of noise the next morning. Since we were staying a week, we decided we weren't going to stay at the Kahala. That is...until we met with a manager in the morning that was the most incredibly helpful woman we had ever met! She went out of her way to help us move to a room that was more to our liking. She was amazing and we ended up having the honeymoon we dreamed of because of her! What a view we had from their 2 story building that's right on the beach!

We chose this hotel after researching a few others in the centre of Waikiki and are so glad we did.We checked in at 2pm and were greeted with a fresh lei. Our room was ready and our bags were taken up for us. The bellhop was a lovely man and gave us info on the hotel, pointing out our restaurant options etc. He explained where everything was in the room and double checked we were OK with it all before leaving us.The room was so nice and airy, we had a view of the golf club in the country club next door out of a long window which stretched nearly the whole length of the room. There is also another little window above the bed which helped make the room seem so airy and open. The bathroom was a great size as was the main room and it was spotlessly clean and well maintained. There was a fridge for personal use in the bathroom and enough glassware if needed and a coffee machine.We both had a 4 drawer dresser so there was more then enough room for all of our clothes and the closest was also big enough to take our 2 suitcases. The safe was big enough to hold our phones, iPad and 13"" MacBook and our passports etc. It also had enough hanging space as well and lots of spare towels, dressing gowns and slippers.The bed was really comfortable and the turn down service of an evening was a nice touch. The staff were all so friendly and welcoming. The pool area was also clean and the poolside bar/restaurant had a good drinks list. The beach was lovely too and there were enough beds everywhere. We loved the hot tub the most as the water temperature was like a very warm bath so it was hard to get of sometimes! We only ate at the poolside bar during our stay, it was nice food and not too unreasonably priced considering we were so far out of Waikiki. The free shuttle to Waikiki is a great amenity, the last one is at 9:45pm and the schedule is on their website. On our first visit there we were so pleased we had chosen to stay outside of Waikiki as it is just like a big city. It was nice to get back to the peace and calm of the Kahala. If you want to visit other places, you will need a car. Parking is $32 a day for self park or valet. We picked up our reserved car from the Hertz office in the hotel - the guy was really rude and pushy so I would not do this again, I would pick our car up at Honolulu airport. It was also busy with a queue outside his office which I think he was getting a bit stressed with, hence him being rude. On our last day the Honolulu marathon was on and the Kahala was great at informing us all what our options were if had to get to the airport or another part of Oahu - a info sheet was left on the bed with our turn down service. Overall we loved loved loved our stay here and did not want to leave, even though we had another week in another hotel on Oahu.

Not the end of the world we thought but not the best start. Luckily, the rooms and breakfast buffet were fantastic for the whole trip. Unfortunately, the concierge was not great as on a few occasions he really stuffed us around. We had booked a boat charter for our group of 8 through the hotel, they knew we had a group of 8 yet booked us onto the boat of 6 as that was the biggest yet failed to tell us until we got an into ready slip under our door. Wasn't exactly fun to decide who would sit out the boat charter for the day. One thing that was great was the free bus shuttle to and from the hotel into waikiki, Stephanie the driver was fantastic and had great tips. If you are wanting some couple time around Christmas I would not recommend this hotel as it is full of families and children, we didn't use the pool once as it was too packed with children, the beach however is divine. If you want a private umbrella on the beach expect to pay up- it isn't cheap. Overall, we did have a great time but there are a few things that need to be fixed, the biggest is management during a bust time of the year. There's no excuse to mess around a large group of 8.

This is not one of the hotels at Waikiki-Beach where one hotel was placed next to the other and the beaches are quite crowded. The Kahala was built in a pleasant residential neighborhood beyond Diamond Head and thus away from Honolulu. The Kahala has a nice private beach and is surrounded by a wonderful park. The hotel site comprises a lagoon with dolphins the guests can swim with. The staff is mainly Japanese, very polite, attentive, friendly and extremely service-oriented. The hotel stay starts with a warmhearted reception at the front desk. The hotel rooms are quite spacious, well-furnished, but not over styled. We had two interconnecting mountain view rooms with a sunrise experience every morning and breath-taking views of the Oahu mountain range near Kahala. The breakfast can be enjoyed right at the fringes of the Pacific underneath wonderful palm trees, listening to the pleasant sound of the ocean waves. The breakfast buffet is just perfect and comprises offer for each and every customer and each and every taste - a remarkable experience. The swimming pool at the Kahala is quite small, however, we never used it as it was far more thrilling to swim in the ocean and do canoeing or stand-up paddling (offered by the hotel). Whenever you want to be at the pulse of Honolulu, after a 15 min drive you are there. Quite near to the hotel, there is the Kahala Mall, a smaller, but nice shopping center with a selected number of restaurants incl. Pizza Hut and Panda Express for a quick lunch. The Kahala is very close to Hanauma Bay and Oahus east coast with Chinaman's Hat and the Polynesian Cultural Center. All the sites of the island a perfectly accessible from the Kahala (Dole Plantation, North Shore, Pearl Harbor etc.). In some areas the hotel needs some renovation; however, it is nevertheless a perfect place to stay when exploring the beauties of Oahu. It is a smaller hotel with a nice atmosphere and a limited number of guests. You will never have the feeling to be at a crowded, noisy place where you might have to stand in line or to queue up for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Being in the Kahala neighborhood offers you a vacation in a tranquil place right at the shore of the Pacific Ocean with a decent Japanese hotel management and concept. Enjoy the Sushi as well as a perfect French Onion Soup! Whenever we get back to Oahu, we will definitely choose the Kahala Hotel & Resport.

Unfortunately we discovered there’s almost no shade around the pool or elsewhere on the grounds. The hotel is located in a residential area and is not convenient to city bus routes, and turned out to be too far away from the alternative activities (restaurants, shopping, nightlife, museums) we like to do when not reading in the shade next to the beach. The hotel provides a complimentary shuttle to Waikiki and to the nearby Kahala Mall, but fixed departure and pickup times are limited. The shuttle will not drop you off at the popular Diamond Head State Monument (picnic grounds, historic hiking trail) located between Kahala and Waikiki. The beach in front of The Kahala is average and suitable for families with small children because of the protected lagoon. The quality of the sand is not as soft as Kaanapali on Maui. If you are on a tour staying here you’ll probably be satisfied since your package likely includes off-site activities each day. If you are an independent traveler, you’ll have to rent a car. Other than watching the dolphins in the hotel lagoon, there’s little to do here. We had planned to relax and read in the shade of trees or umbrellas, but that turned out nearly impossible. On our second day we were not allowed to raise the umbrella shading our poolside lounge chairs because the wind was too strong, and yet the previous day was windier and all the umbrellas were raised. The first room we were given was not what we had reserved, but the hotel did relocate us quickly. Since we’ve had many ocean view rooms during previous Hawaii visits, the “scenic view” room was fine and less expensive. It looked out over the golf course, with beautiful early morning mountain and sky views. The room was spacious and the bed comfortable. Placement of the extendable wall TV was odd, partially blocking the bathroom door. Separate “his & her” sink areas were convenient, with good storage/closet space and ample hangars. There was a large soaking tub and nice walk-in shower. The tile floor of the shower was somewhat slippery, but no non-skid mat was provided. Another small but noticeable omission: no soap was provided for the shower; just one bar at each sink. The patio furniture was rusting, with faded and torn fabric. Be careful with your room selection: a section of lower-level “partial ocean view” rooms are located above the noisy hotel entrance and parking garage. We ate at most of the hotel restaurants and enjoyed the Plumeria Room (ground level downstairs, indoor and outdoor seating) for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Off the main lobby The Veranda serves cocktails, appetizers and light dinner items. Both the Veranda and Plumeria Room provided good food and service. If you like a full breakfast your best value is to add the breakfast buffet package to your room rate since it includes taxes and gratuities and all you can eat! We enjoyed The Veranda several times, and one evening our server was especially personable --- can’t spell her long first name and she is originally from the Philippines. The Seaside Grill is located between the pool and beach and serves lunch and dinner. Unfortunately for lunch it has little shade over the tables and when it rains everyone scrambles to find cover. There is a bar next to the pool but during our weekend visit there was no poolside beverage service. Guests walked up to the bar to get their beverages. The pool looked old and is small for the number of chairs surrounding it. Chair cushions are covered in fabric which means the insides get wet from rain. You discover this after sitting down and getting wet shorts. The lobby of the hotel is pretty in an older-Hawaiian way, with interesting displays of Hawaiian cultural artifacts. Guests are greeted with orchid leis upon arrival. The Kahala Hotel seems popular with business groups (ample space for meetings and functions of all sizes), tour groups from overseas, and wedding events. Children and adults can participate in the in-water educational dolphin programs, which range from $125 for 15 minutes to $700 for 5-hour 30- minutes. The 1-hour $310 Dolphin Adventure was a unique experience. There is also a five-day “Trainer for a Week” program for $3,250.Overall the Kahala Hotel was disappointing. There is little to do, especially when there is no reliable shade to relax poolside or near the beach. Shade trees should be added on the Koko Head side of the lawn area next to the beach. Remove some of the lagoon area and oldest low-rise rooms and replace them with a beachside waterpark with slides and swim-up islands, like a smaller version of the Grand Hyatt Poipu. Make the Kahala more of a destination property since it is far away from alternative activities.","Scottsdale, Arizona","CJSArizona</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",188,3.0

The setting though is beautiful, and set away from the hustle of Waikiki. We first checked into an ocean view room with a balcony. We looked out over the front entry and parking lot...and then the ocean. The bathroom was tiny, dated and with one sink so we moved to and ocean front room in the KOko head tower that was better. The spa suites were unique years ago, but the check in area now feels dated and uncomfortable. There is no common relaxation area. Our two deep tissue messages were $525 for 60 minutes and were just ok. They gave us a little snack when we pad the bill-- plastic cup like the kind you get take out condiments in with stale trail mix. I would expect way more for these prices. Our lunch of two salads and water at Plumeria was $98. The breakfast buffet is good (the price is higher on weekends) but it's exactly the same as 2006 right down to the maple glazed pancakes. Hoku's dinner was delicious but the waiters are stressed, literally running at times and leaving dirty dishes stashed on tables throughout the Resturant. Again, I would expect a higher level of refinement and meticulous attention to detail for the prices. I am suprised the hotel hasn't adapted to the latest food changes on the island- farm to table etc. In fact, they have adapted at all in the past 10 years.

Morning Buffet breakfast is quite good. Valet parking has a charge - even though the garage says full - valet only. There's not a better beach choice on the Island - imo.

Twice, the hotel closed restaurants at times different from their published times; the staff was unapologetic. The pool bar seems poorly staffed and there's is no clear signage to indicate when it is closed and when it is not. I had to wander to find someone to give me a towel. I sat in one chair and was told to move because another guest had reserved that row or chairs. I moved to another chair and was told I needed to pay to use those chairs under an umbrella. Again, NO SIGNAGE! The staff member was incredulous at my suggested fix. ""A sign on every chair?!"" she retorted. Yes! It's a simple pre-printed sign that says ""reserved"". Everywhere else in the world has them! Also, I was told there were no tables at the restaurant but the pool bar opens at 10:30an. While that statement is factual, it's completely misleading: the pool bar opens at 10:30 but doesn't start serving food until 11am.This isn't the worst hotel, it's just nowhere near five stars.

In mid October there are only adults and adults with small children, probably because of school. The hotel was not crowded and it was easy to get beach/pool side lounges at most any time of the day.It is expensive and, as is usual in the high end hotels these days, they charge extra for a cabana on the beach ($115/day) and for shaded lounge chairs on the beach ($40/4h). Drinks and meals are pricey, but that is to be expected as this is not a budget resort. The beach is small but nice. A reef encroaches the swimming area which makes for a long expanse of shallows but a relatively smaller area with sandy bottom. Paddle boarding is a good way to get out on the water, if the wind isn't too high.I was surprised that they have dolphins as well as sea turtles and rays captive in large natural looking pools on the property. If you are into it, you can ""swim with the dolphins"" in these shallow pools. They are well trained, which some might consider a little sad.The breakfast restaurant overlooks the water and has a very nice buffet for $22/$34 depending on if you want grilled meat or omelettes or more of a continental approach. There is a seating area for afternoon tea (reservations suggested on weekends) and evening drinks. Entertainment is lounge-y and for an older crowd.The rooms are spacious and well appointed. We had a lanai with partial ocean view as did another couple we were with. Our room looked out over the ocean and parking lot, theirs really looked out more over the hillside. Both lanais were noisy with a generator near one and a very loud waterfall near the other. The noise didn't carry over into the room. Unless you are going very high end with full ocean views on a higher floor, I would not recommend spending extra on a lanai. It sounds romantic, but you get better, more peaceful views from seating all over the property.Staff were helpful and friendly as would be expected when paying upwards of $400+ for a room. No one really stood out. The valet service was excellent and quick. My wife participated in the yoga classes on 2 days and enjoyed them.We hiked the nearby Koko crater rail trail.

Our ocean view room was spectacular and very well kept by housekeeping, the beach is beautiful and the amenities are lovely. We were particularly impressed by Pacific Dreams Photography, a complimentary professional photography service that the hotel offers. Before arriving in Hawaii I did some research hoping to find a photographer that might capture this special time in our lives but without any first had recommendations it was hard to make a decision on a company. To find that the Kahala offered this service allowed us to have our photos taken without the financial commitment up front and purchase the photos that we loved individually afterwards. The photographer, Julia, was very talented and we were incredibly impressed with her photos. Lauryn helped us with the selection process and was awesome, as well!Everyone at Dolphin Quest was very informative whenever we had questions and my Dolphin Dip was unforgettable. I do feel 1 or 2 photos should be included with the package rather than charging extra for them.Sean from the Seaside Grill was incredibly attentive and helpful and made our experience unforgettable. We also really enjoyed Anthony ""Tony"" from the Italian restaurant. We tried all of the restaurants on our stay and were happy with them overall. We did find that it was tacky to ""charge for shade"" as one of the towel assistants put it. Most of the tents and shaded chairs were empty during the slow season and when you pay $600+ for a room and high prices for drinks and food, it would be nice if they offered beach umbrellas or some option for shade rather than everyone having to huddle under the one tree on the beach where the sand wasn't as nice and it was hard to get service. I also found the shuttle reverse beeping to be disruptive and the beach groomer was quite loud while we were trying to enjoy the sunrise in the morning. Overall we were very happy with the hotel and would recommend it to friends as a high end option in beautiful Honolulu.","Vancouver, Canada","reneetea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

We already want to go back. We splurged on an ocean front room and were not disappointed. The rooms are spectacular, the service is five star, and the lobby still takes your breath away when you first arrive. Kahala has managed, somehow, to balance its 1960s Hawaiian look with all of the modern touches that you expect in a luxury hotel. The last thing that the Kahala needs is ""updating."" If you leave the Kahala thinking it does you probably should have stayed at Trump or the Hilton.The resort has, I think, resolved its service issues at Veranda and at the pool/beach, which I mentioned in my review a few years ago and prevented me from giving the place 5 stars. The staff at Veranda was very attentive and friendly. I think they are still understaffed out at the pool, as there were a couple times where we had trouble getting their attention, but for the most part service there was perfectly fine.Staff at both places told us that the resort is about to substantially change their respective menus. I took every opportunity to tell them to bring back their nachos, which we loved on past trips and was one of the few things on the menu really accessible to kids. I fear that the hotel will try to ""upscale"" the menu and eliminate things like the still excellent cheeseburger. The last thing the pool menu needs is another raw fish option.One thing that really bothered us: every time the shuttle backed up in front of the hotel--more times each day than you can count--we could hear the beep beep beep of it going in reverse. Management should really figure out a way to have the shuttle exit the driveway without going in reverse because it really can ruin your solitude in your ocean front room, not to mentioned the atmosphere of the Veranda. But that is my only real criticism. I've already started saving for our next trip.","Medford, Oregon","John N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Medford, Oregon</strong>",23,5.0

The rooms and decor were lovely and in good taste; and the staff was mainly very friendly, accommodating and helpful.

Just because something isn't modern doesn't mean its not classic or well kept (which this hotel is).The valet, concierge, bell service, shuttle driver, and housekeeping were all helpful and polite. The spa (although pricey) was one of the best experience's I have had at a spa and the staff was extremely nice.The downsides to this hotel were limited and very specific in my opinion:  - The service at the Seaside Grill is horrible. Errors abounded and it was clear that the staff couldn't have cared less (you can see my review at Yelp under Sarah R). - You have to pay for umbrellas. Cabanas I can understand completely, but to make guest who are paying $500+ a night at a high end resort pay for the luxury of not being sunburned seemed a little cheap on the part of the hotel in my opinion. I expect that basic things like shade will be provided without being nickeld-and-dimed, that is why I am staying here and not the Hilton.Overall I would likely stay here again, although I really would want to see those two issues fixed before I could say I am sure.

On arrival the staff were fantastic, greeting us in Hawaii style and helping us with everything we needed. On checking in they provided us with an upgrade to a Suite with views directly on to the Dolphin Enclosure. The room was one of the largest I've ever stayed in with a lounge area and a large bathroom with his and hers sinks either end. They had a twice daily maid service which would always keep everything topped up and a turn down service in the evening which was a nice touch. The room was a good walk from the Lobby, but a short walk to the beach and swimming pool. Although the restaurants were fairly expensive, it's what you would expect from a 5 star resort like this. We wasn't here long enough to try all of the restaurants but the ones we did try were worth it. All of the staff from the front desk, to maids, to waiters and bar staff were all fantastic. Always looking to help and very kind. Although it was outside of Waikiki, the hotel offers a free shuttle bus into town which runs about once an hour which I thought was excellent. It could be quite expensive if getting taxi's because it was about $30-40 each way depending on which part of Waikiki we we're travelling too. We tried to use the shuttle bus whenever possible, but the latest return is about 9:45pm and therefore if returning back late a taxi is needed. I would definitely recommend this hotel to those who don't want to stay in the city, but want to be close enough to be able to go into the city when you want.

Yes, they were polite, but their was an insincerity about them. Nor did they appear to be happy (I know this all sounds weird, but it is true). They seem to have cut many corners, which leads to believe that, once again, they are under new management (this was confirmed by employees). They close a poolside bar we used to frequent two nights a week (who does that and why?), they had considerably less poolside staff working, and then to garner additional revenue, they installed (while we were laying out poolside) 3-4 private cabanas that blocked your ocean view! The interesting thing is that no one used them the entire time we were there. It is like they were squeezing every available fee revenue possible, and let the guests enjoyment be damned. Had I not been going to the Kahala for over 25 years, I may not have noticed these things, but I definitely did. There was a lack of joy or morale in the employees that was noticeable.

We often found ourselves by late afternoon wanting a snack before we went out for dinner and would realize the grill had just closed or was about the close leaving the nicer restaurants as our only option.

We had friends and family members stay for an average of three nights. Although the wedding itself was amazing (good location; and great food and beverage service), the service and experience at the hotel was horrible. Here is what happened to us-1. We got a smoking room, when we explicitly told them that we were nonsmokers and did not want a smoking room or smoking floor. When I complained, they moved us. They thought they were doing us a favor, and decided to move us two hours before the wedding ceremony. 2. They got our luggage mixed up, and delivered someone else's luggage twice. They told us that they were confused by the fact that so many people had the same first name initial, and last name. 3. My friend's laundry went missing. She had gotten it sent out to be cleaned, but some of her clothes never made it back. 4. We tried to get a fork and knife from room service. When we called, there was no response and we were placed on hold for five minutes. Then we were told that it was OUR fault since we were calling at a busy time of the day. My friend, who works in the travel industry, had to tell them that they should then staff accordingly.5. The bellman attempted to throw our luggage into the trunk--he missed and the luggage hit the rental car, leaving a scratch. He said, ""Wow..That was heavier than I thought."" My partner had to load up our own luggage as we were leaving.6. The worst part has been the billing and accounting/reservations desk. There was a charge on my credit card I didn't understand. When I called the resort to ask where the charge came from, they passed the blame onto each other--the reservation blaming the accounting, etc. it's been 48 hours, and no one has explained to me where the charge came from and to whom it pertains. I also had to remind them about the 500 room deposit, and ask for it. I wonder: what would have happened if I didn't double, triple check all of my bills and invoices from the wedding?7. The staff at the front desk were rude, and treated us pretty much like garbage. I have stayed at other Leading Hotels of the World, including the Shilla and the Faisano in Brazil. The Kahala does not deserve to be part of LHW. In fact, the night before we checked into the Kahala, we stayed in a small hotel in Waikiki that was a third of the price.

Carpeting in many parts of the hotel needs a good cleaning.

Don't like paying for the umbrellas and cabanas but when I complained the very gracious Manager gave us a cabana gratis for the rest of our stay.Our room, with balcony and ocean view was fabulous and very quiet. Despite having read past reviews regarding stains and lack of upkeep, we have found no evidence of this.The beach is away from the madding crowd of Waikiki, clean, calm and very swimmable!The whole experience, although a little pricey has been thoroughly enjoyable.PS.

They have dolphins on property which is nice for kids to see but I thought that the pool area was a little bit small. That aside, walking into the lobby you just seem to feel yourself relax. After taking the time to travel to Hawaii that was a nice experience. If you decide to upgrade your room to have a view of the ocean I would recommend trying to get a high floor (but not the 10th unless you smoke as that is their ""smoker"" floor) and keep in mind that the ocean is going to be beyond the parking lot or the roof of the lobby. Higher floor helps get a bit more above that.If you are wanting to be in Waikiki where all the action is than I would caution that this resort is by Diamond Head so you aren't on Waikiki Beach but if it's peacefulness and relaxation that you're looking for this was a great option.","Minnetonka, Minnesota","skiergirl92</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minnetonka, Minnesota</strong>",33,4.0

I did see one guy wave his hands around for quite sometime before he finally got up as well. I did mention it to the bar staff at the restaurant and they said I'm not the first to complain in the last few days! Water should at least be taken around regularly, especially in that muggy hot weather. We asked for a mountain view, well really it's a golf club view, but the room itself was nice/clean and very quiet. Great shuttle service to/from shopping centres.

So many Presidents and political figures have visited over the years in addition to several Celebrities. The Kahala is FAMOUS for that.Unfortunately, It wasn't what we had expected. The property is very pretty but not very big, so if you like that, this is the place for you. They have a Dolphin Encounter on site. It is very cool to see the Dolphins and other sea animals on the property. We did not swim with Dolphins, as we had done previously. The pool and pool area are VERY small.I was actually surprised when I saw it. The beach is the place to be. Very pretty, but not a lot to do for kids. You should know that ALL the beaches on the Island are PUBLIC. Don't be surprised if you see some locals using the facilities and some dogs on the beach. The Hotel lobby, bar and resturants are nice... open air. The resturant by the pool/beach area needs a bigger/better selection of items. After a couple days of eating there you are definately wanting something different. Whole Foods and the mall are very close by.. Several people got food from there. Our room was nice. The furniture a bit dated but I think part of the charm of the hotel. Housekeeping was not the best... Complained several times due to trash not being emptied and coffee not being replenished. We had an issue with our TV... That wouldn't turn off, a few times... They eventually replaced the TV. Complained as well. I think customer service overall needs some work, especially at the front desk, However, the concierge was great. My Biggest THANK YOU goes to the Front Service Manager Masaharu Holeso (Masa) who was AMAZING! He went out of his way on several occasions during his stay to make sure we were comfortable and well taken care of. This was our 1st time in Honolulu.

The room was fantastic with a large balcony with a couple chairs and a table. It overlooked the waterfall (manmade) that also serves to oxygenate the large dolphin lagoon (5 male, trained dolphins). Our room had an extremely comfortable king-size bed. I loved the large (I'm guessing 50-inch) Sony LCD television that, attached to a wall-mount, swivels out a good distance for viewing from any part of the room.The bathroom had two sinks, at opposite ends, with their own respective mirror, vanities, closets and ample drawers. There was a large bath tub (fantastic) and a separate shower. We also had a coffee-maker and cups, beer/wine glasses, bottle-openers, etc. The evening turn-down service was nice. She also tidied up the room... and placed two Hawaiian dark chocolates on our pillows along with two bottles of Hawaiian artisan water. And the maid also made sure our ice-bucket was always full. My wife and I loved watching the dolphins throughout the week. They played and sometimes stopped and peeked at us as we watched from one of the many viewing spots. For a large fee you can book a private session where you (and as many people are in your group) can don life vests and sit on a ledge with your legs in the waters... and the trainer will introduce you to a couple dolphins and you can touch them, get photos, etc. Then they will jump out of the water and do some tricks. We didn't do it ourselves but enjoyed watching those who did. The swimming pool is large and always clean. There is also a jacuzzi. The pool house staff always has fresh towels on hand (free) and they will also set up beach chairs anywhere you choose along the resort's large, private beach. For an extra fee (the chairs are also free) you can get an umbrella. The resort's free shuttle was very convenient and saved us a ton of money otherwise used for a taxi. It runs (there is only one and the driver is super nice) daily and drops (and picks you up) you at either the Ala Moana Shopping Center, Waikiki beach or the Kahala Shopping Center. The main thing we loved about the Kahala Resort & Spa was the peace and quiet (compared to staying at Waikiki); especially at night.

Location secluded which is what we wanted. There was a shuttle in to Waikiki which was good. Our room was on the ground floor facing the golf course (1108). The room itself was nice but noise was an issue. There was a kids club room just around the corner, and every morning excited children would be running by to go to club. Possibly this room is better for a family.The hotel pool was small and very crowded at times. This was also full of children and hence very noisy. We have nothing against children but would have preferred a seperate adults only pool. The hotel beech was beautiful and the only niggle here was the lack of umbrellas, in a 5 star hotel I don't expect to pay for the use of a sun shade. We chose to do the dolphin experience and really enjoyed it, expensive but worth it. I had a facial at the spa and this was also good. The service in the poolside restaurant was very slow especially at lunch times. Food was ok though. We experienced hoku and the Italian restaurants and the food and service at both were great. The veranda restaurant was not as good for service, the staff there seemed disinterested and we were often left waiting a while. if you want a meal there be warned, portions are small. My husband ordered risotto as his main, it was laughably small. Special mention to Gloria on the concierge desk, she was very helpful and had a great sense of humour. Overall we felt the location and setting were great, but little things left our experience being less than 5 star. With improved attention to detail this place could be awesome.

Eating breakfast in a relaxed environment thirty feet from the beach, is heavenly. Every request we made, every question we asked, was met with immediate positive, accurate responses.

The Kahala features grand elements that suggests it was one of the best luxury resorts on the island back in its prime, but even good maintenance cannot diminish the passage of time.Getting around on O'ahu:Your best bet would be renting a car for your duration, unless you want to stay at the resort for your entire holiday. There is nothing wrong with that, but since there are a lot of sights around, you would be missing quite a few things. The Kahala is also situated on the southern tip of the island, so getting around isn't exactly convenient without a vehicle.The Kahala:From a glace, I would guess that the resort was built sometime between the late 60's to early 70's. Even though the resort has been properly managed, the style and the front desk gives it away. The rooms are fairly spacious, and the staff service is commendable. My wife asked for a kettle (we are used to having hot / warm water), but the first kettle we received had so much rust on the heat coils that it was awful to look at (they promptly returned with one in a much better condition). We got a room with disabled assess, so the bathroom was fairy large. The downside was, the disabled alarm was malfunctioning at 7 am the next morning so that set my wife in a sour mood for the rest of the day. The hotel does have a pool which houses several bottlenose dolphins, guests can get close to the fence to take some pictures or pay a premium for a relatively short interaction with them. Overall, I found the stay below average relative to the price I paid.Activities around the Kahala:The Diamond head national monument is about 10 minutes drive from the resort, and if you are in physically good condition, the 1 hour+ hike is definitely worth the view. There should also be some great dive sites off Koko crater, which is at the southern end of the island - so find yourself a charter and dive away!Hope this helps to those who are planning to visit Hawaii soon! I personally found the vacation rewarding, but for those used to travelling in SE Asia - the 15% gratuity can be a little hefty for the wallet.","Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong","Heero_Yue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong</strong>",17,3.0

The location of the hotel is off the beaten track, but there is a regular free hotel shuttle to Ala Moana and Kahala Mall, and Waikiki. Highlights include: top drawer amenities, turn down service every evening, free bottles of water every day, tons of large towels, a wonderful shower and soaking tub, and oh-so-soft bed linens. What makes this hotel so special is the attention to detail, and concern for customer satisfaction. Everyone is super friendly and helpful, and you never feel rushed at any time. Even the pool staff is great and will take a beach chair down to the beach for you and cover it with a fresh terry cloth cover. No need to return pool towels or sign for anything: trust is the hallmark of the hotel.

There is even a early morning coffee station in the lobby with free coffee, cream, and tea, and the coffee is premium quality and fresh. We will definitely be doing this again.

I'm an American who grew up in Asia, Central America and the U.S. I have stayed in hotels worldwide since age 8. I travel twice a month on business. I have stayed at some of the best (Oriental Bangkok) and some of the worst. (No need to name), and some predictable, ordinary ones. (Residence Inn type of thing).At the Kahala, we stayed on the 3rd floor facing the golf course and hillside, that was fine, even though it was not an ocean view. The room decor was very nice, and the room was renovated recently enough not to cause issues with mold or smells. The hotel is placed nicely so that no one has a street or parking lot view, as far as I know. Unlike at *any* American-owned Honolulu hotel, when I called twice in advance of arriving and mentioned that this was a very special occasion, a return to Hawaii with mother and sister and our families 30 years after moving away, AND that I had broken my foot just a week before the vacation, and that we were in one room with two adults and two children, and would appreciate any available upgrade, neither the reservations agent nor the front desk nor anyone volunteered to upgrade us in any way. No mention of a a high floor or an ocean view or a suite or any of the things that would have happened at most Waikiki hotels, and did happen for my mother and sister at both the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Embassy Suites properties. They were upgraded to two bedroom suites to give them sufficient space at no extra charge. I got the feeling that the staff did their best to give us the nicest room that our room rate justified but were strictly not allowed to give upgrades. I repeatedly felt this way on the property, that the ownership and/or management is so very concerned with getting every last dime from every customer, that the small niceties that a normal human employee would do for a guest are just not allowed without an upcharge. After paying $17.50 for buffet breakfast for my child, where she ate a little fruit and a muffin, when she was crying with hunger and a minor injury an hour later and I returned to the buffet to ask if I could have another muffin, I was told ""yes, but I must charge you."" I agreed to this but wasn't impressed. As a business owner myself, I can picture the owners paying a pretty penny for the property and needing to get their investment back. But some things were just annoying. At home we own a $250 Caravan pop-up canopy in pristine condition, that even has tent walls. At the Kahala a ratty canopy without walls costs $115/day plus tax and fees, so about $130, to rent some shade for two people per day at the beach when we were already hotel guests. Seems wrong when the said tents are getting quite ragged and broken.The service poolside and at the beach was slow, and I know, because due to my injury, I was hopping all around the place getting my own towels and letting the bar staff know about the tray of pineapple drinks another guest had rudely left in front of our beach chairs for four hours.Seeing the display of straw hats outside of the Plumeria restaurant where the daily breakfast took place, I went to the spa store and attempted to buy one. The worker there first said they didn't sell any. When I explained the display, she said ""that must be just for display."" When I pointed to the one hanging on the door behind her, she was about to say that it was just for display as well, when I gave her a ""look."" She took it off the door, and lo and behold, the standard straw hat I could get at my local farmers' market was $156! I had just lost my much nicer straw hat on the airplane, and badly needed one, but just could not stomach that silly price for a hat that wasn't as nice as mine. I ended up buying on at the Hilton Hawaiian Village which has a store run by two nice Korean ladies and has perfectly fair prices. My $28 hat, was indeed, $28.On the day we left, I finally saw the other shops in an interior corridor on the property and there they sold sun hats from $28 to $250. Strange that the spa employee didn't direct me there!For high tea, we sat ourselves down at a sofa and chairs around a large, square coffee table. There were 11 of us. The staff seemed a little irritable about trying to fit so many place mats around one coffee table. I suggested they bring a second one or add tables to the corners of our area to accommodate us, and the server actually refused on the grounds that another customer might need them!!!! Who, may I ask, was a bigger customer for high tea that day than us? No one. And in fact, it was a slow day, being a bit drizzly, and a weekday. The tea was fine.A friend has told me to get the buffet breakfast because it was ""the best,"" so we did. Actually, it was just a very large selection of ordinary and sometimes sub-par breakfast food. I would have rather had a lower-priced, perfectly balanced breakfast each day, creating less waste and not gaining any weight from the need to ""try everything"" or ""get our money's worth."" There was a selection of cut watermelon, papaya, pineapple, and strawberries. The papaya was absolutely perfect every day. The pineapple was mostly very good, but oddly underripe sometimes. There was lox and cream cheese, prosciutto and cheeses, coconut tapioca sweet soup, miso soup, and fresh hot rice and pickles. There was a toaster and bagels (didn't look boiled so I didn't try them) and bread, and small sweet danishes and muffins. The blueberry muffins were very good. There were hot foods, including bacon, sausage, potatoes, and sometimes one Asian selection. One day there were char siu bao, which our family appreciated. There was a waffle iron going nonstop and whipped cream, maple syrup or coconut syrup for the waffles. There was a long daily line for the omelets with a nice selection of fillings, including previously frozen bay shrimp, ham, spinach, jalapeno, tomato, shredded cheese, and onion. The cooks overcooked the eggs, though. One day I asked for poached eggs but first they were so raw I had to send them back, and then they were too hard. I could tell chef was boiling them instead of taking them off the heat. There were malasadas, but not as perfect as Leonards'. In retrospect, I wouldn't get the breakfast buffet ($35 per person on the weekdays and more on the weekends) and would either order off the breakfast menu or get a case of papaya at Costco, and eat it in my room or at poolside before heading out each morning. I hope they expand the breakfast menu, add a Japanese breakfast, and teach the cooks to prepare eggs properly.One night we happened upon a seafood buffet at dinnertime at the Plumeria, which was very large and enjoyed by the whole family. Our servers were so kind and helpful.We appreciated that there were child menu prices at all the restaurants on the property. Child meals around the pool or on the veranda were about $10. Arancino restaurant on the property had the most adorable pizzas for the kids. They shaped the dough to be an animal face with ears. There was even a little cheese in the ears, and the child's chocolate cake with chocolate whipped cream was ""perfect,"" according to my 7-year-old. Our server was so kind to the children.I was surprised that even though the hotel now has Japanese ownership, it didn't offer Japanese specialties in its casual dining by the pool or on the veranda, and didn't offer wet towels at meal service. For us, that would have at least made it interesting. It would have been nice to also have a spa menu.

The reviews and incidental praise from friends and colleagues perhaps over sold this old school Japanese owned hotel. The room rate was fair. Everything else was fleecing. The pool and beach chaise lounges and pillows have lived beyond their useful lives. The towel covers and towels are adequate if you can hunt them down with beach and pool service being sporadic UNLESS you want a well priced drink. Mediocre rose $16 U.S. for a weak hot cup. Want a frozen drink, say a piña colada in a pineapple? $32. Buffet breakfast $40/person.Want an umbrella on the beach. $25. :60 minutes with the captive in-house dolphins $335. Let's not forget the taxes, service charges and tips.You'd do better with a daily resort fee and training your beach/pool staff to attend to the guests even when their not 'selling' (drink; umbrella).Last, it rains now and again. Be prepared for it to stop and the guests to need service. A notice that the ocean is closed in proximity to the ocean would help. Some staff at the pool to dole out towels and fetch drinks would as well. It's not as if you're reducing your room rate for the reduced service!

We decided to celebrate our first anniversary with a staycation at the Kahala and it was perfect.We stayed two nights in a scenic view room. Our room was on the first floor with a lanai that opened to Waialae golf course. This may not sound appealing to many (especially when there is a beach on the other side of the hotel) but my husband loves golf and he loved being on the golf course. It was perfect for us.The service at this hotel is first class! The rooms are clean, turndown service always happened when we were out to dinner and our room was always stocked with water and a bucket of ice. Without us ever asking! Also as we were celebrating our anniversary the hotel left a welcome note and a sweet treat in our room. A very nice touch that makes this hotel truly 5 stars. During our stay, we had dinner at Arancino, lunch at the pool and Sunday brunch at Hokus. At Arancino, our waiter Tony did an amazing job recommending his favorites (we got the tasting menus and we were not disappointed). Tony took care of all the tiny details. He had the chef make us an anniversary dessert and even gave us a small box of macaroons for us to take back to our room. Awesome!At the pool, we made an all day cabana reservation and my husband asked if they had a cabana that could connect to wifi (so he could fantasy football draft on his iPad...). The pool staff accommodated this request without hesitation and set us up on the cabana nearest the pool (that has wifi) but is still on the beach. It was absolutely perfect. The husband got to do his fantasy football drafts without fail and from a cabana on the beach! Lunch and drinks also got served in the cabana and we didn't have to move from our spot all day.

We had a lovely room in the tower with views of both the ocean and the golf course. Do get as high as you can! Although the hotel claims it is a five-star resort and charges accordingly, it is not. Perhaps it was when first built however at this point many many aspects of it fall far from the mark. It's in need of a complete overhaul from the shabby rugs to the worn cushions. However it met our needs. We intentionally avoided the crowd at Waikiki, but it is only 15 minutes away. I don't know if there is a better option. Staff were inconsistent. No welcome lei for us! Sometimes friendly sometime curt. The mile long sandy beach is lovely and the food while expensive, was tasty. It was a perfect spot from which to enjoy the beauty of this island. Our plan was to hike early each morning then return to our hotel for a pretty nice buffet breakfast. There were lots of hungry people each morning, and the food was often in need of replenishing. There were enough choices but not a spectacular spread. Then we would head to beach time to digest. This worked pretty well. We were able to always get a beach chair. We avoid the noisy small pool. We ate each night at one of the different restaurants at the Kahala. All were ok- tasty but overpriced but in a very pretty setting. And easy. We were tired boys and girls by dinner.

We loved the size of the room and how it was set up with 2 bathrooms. The MAJOR problem was the pull out queen sized bed. If this is a ""Family"" Suite, then it is probably typical that someone will be sleeping on the pull out bed. It was the WORST quality bed of any suite/villa that we have ever stayed in. No person, or child of any age, should have to sleep on something so old and cheap, especially at this high quality resort and for the price of the suite. We have experienced MUCH nicer pull out couch beds, so I know that they exist. I feel that for the price we paid for the suite, the second available bed should have been at a MUCH HIGHER quality. After the first night when it squeaked all night and hurt my kids' backs, we asked for an adjustment and for extra padding. It was only slightly better, and certainly not up to par of what it should have been. It really needs to be replaced! If we had known the pull out bed would be so terrible, we would have opted for 2 rooms, with the 2nd one having 2 nicer double beds instead of the terrible pull out couch.

Upon reporting this, the staff were so helpful and gracious. They told us that another room would be organised for us. We went for something to eat and when we returned, the manager came to speak to us. He apologized for the inconvenience, which for us it was no problem at all. We were just happy to be there! He generously upgraded our room, this was so unexpected and amazing. It got our stay off to an incredible start.Our room was spotless and the decor was beautiful, from the gorgeous wooden floors to the muslin curtains blowing in the breeze. Everything you would dream of in a tropical setting.Our room had a partial ocean view and looked out onto the mountains and golf course. We normally pay for ocean view and were therefore uncertain about the scenic rooms but I have to say they were beautiful. There is a waterfall at the back of the hotel and it sounds so lovely at night. i wouldn't hesitate. to book this room category again. my only recommendation is to book the Koko Head wing.We enjoyed our breakfast in the Plumeria on several occasions, we choose to eat from the a la-cart menu as opposed to the buffet. we thought the buffet was very expensive but perhaps would be good as a brunch option. I highly recommend their waffles, so light and delicious.Overall, dining is expensive but the food is good. You are well looked after and the standard of dining service is excellent. Our only complaint was that we found some of the younger servers less friendly and lacking in attention but that may be down to experience.What made our stay so wonderful, were all the staff that greeted us with such warmth and attention. In particular, Gloria and Leimomi at the concierge desk. These two ladies made us feel so welcome and they looked after us so well. We would return to the Kahala just to see them! Everyday we were greeted with a warm smile from so many staff and we felt the service was exceptional, especially housekeeping. We have stayed in many 5 star resorts but this was definitely the nicest overall experience we have had. It was amazing how many staff addressed us by name.After we had checked out, we realized that we had left some items in our room. We were very grateful to Anastasia, from housekeeping, who made sure that our belongings were safe until we could pick them up.There are many positives to say about this hotel. From the pool, which is lovely at night and so warm, to the beach. The photos don't do it justice. There are some drawbacks to staying here. if you don't have a car, you are restricted. to on site dining, which is very expensive.if staying here make use of the free shuttle into Waikiki. Use the bicycles at the resort to explore the locality, its really beautiful. Consider hiring a car, it gives you more freedom.Overall, we really recommend a stay here. There may be some areas of refurbishment required but there are no significant issues. Anything pales into the background when taken in the context of the whole experience.We have stayed in many of the top hotels in Honolulu and the Kahala beats them all. This is where we will return.",Ireland,"3Moonbows</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ireland</strong>",19,5.0

This resort was everything we could have hoped for. The location is great if you are looking to get away from the craziness of Waikiki, although it's not too far away and the resort provides a shuttle. The beach is beautiful and it was never over-crowded. We always got chairs, and a lot of the time we felt like we had our own private beach. We didn't spend much time at the pool, but that was nice as well. I read some reviews that said the pool was small, but I did not think it was. Plus the beach is steps away so why worry about the pool! One of my favorite parts of the resort was the dolphin and sea turtle lagoons. It was just awesome to be able to walk by that every day and see the dolphins frolicking around, what a unique experience!I also liked the fact that the servers didn't walk around all day peddling drinks on the beach. They were around if you wanted something, but they weren't bothersome at all. The Veranda was a great place to go at night to relax and enjoy the view. The breakfast buffet at Plumeria was delicious! We ate at the Seaside grill every day for lunch and everything we had there was very good, and at reasonable prices. The service was great at Arancino, but the food was just so-so. We did take the shuttle to Waikiki to eat dinner a couple times, because there were not a ton of options at the resort. But again, they provided a shuttle do it was no big deal. We rented a car to explore the rest of the island one day, and I couldn't wait to get back to the Kahala. They have a rental car agency on site that the Concierge pushed for, but we saved over $100 by going to Enterprise a couple miles away. I loved every staff member there, with the exception of the one concierge - I do feel he was pushing us towards certain things, maybe they had deals with the hotel. That was no big deal, I would just suggest you do your research as well. Fantastic time at a fantastic resort!

When we visit Hawaii, we normally stay on the Big Island, with an occasional stay on Maui or Kauai. That said, this time work took me to Oahu, so we decided to make a long weekend of it there. We were seeking a “resort” experience away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki Beach. The Kahala delivered on this front. However, if your looking for the peace and quiet and refined service of the Four Seasons Hualalai, this is not “quite “ it. The service, while good (as it should be for the prices they charge), is not exceptional. Don’t get me wrong. Most of the staff we met were wonderful, friendly and forthcoming. It’s just that the processes behind them were missing that certain “something” one expects at a 5 star hotel. A few examples: Our arrival to the hotel: Doors were opened of our taxi, our bags placed on the curb, and then…nothing. We were unsure of what to do. So we inquired of one of the busy bell staff. After throwing leis around our necks – literally - she assured us someone would be by to greet us immediately. After few minutes…we were still standing there next to our bags. Strange. We took our bags to the front desk ourselves. Not the biggest issue one can think of and likely makes the reader think us a couple of prigs, which we really are not – but I use this an example of how the “system” at this hotel fell apart.  A second example of this: We made a reservation at the on-premise Italian Restaurant (Arancino) over 1 week in advance. When we arrived for our 7:30pm reservation we were escorted to a table inside, waaay in the back of the restaurant (at the rear entrance) - (who wants to sit inside in Hawaii? – and who wants to sit next to the door?) When we inquired about sitting at of one of 5 or 6 empty tables that where available on the veranda, we were told they were needed for later reservations!?! Again, this makes us sound like pretty high maintenance people. We really are not. That said, when we spend 5 star prices ($500+) on a hotel room, and are prepared to spend $300 - $400 on dinner, we do expect something beyond the Hilton or Applebees. We ended up at the other restaurant at the Kahala – Hoku’s where the food and service (and place they sat us) where all outstanding. One of the best in Hawaii. Again, let me reiterate, most of the staff at this resort is wonderful. They are as good as some of the people we have met at The Four Seasons and Aman resorts. It’s the system that needs a tune up. The rooms at the Kahala are quite large, beds comfortable, views out of most rooms very nice. Unfortunately, they are just a slight bit on the dated side and baths have a single vanity. (Again, not the end of the world, but they are charging real money for this place). Be sure to book or request a room with a veranda (if that is your thing, as only every other room has one). Finally, the most distributing thing, and something that should give all pause who are considering a stay here are the captive Atlantic Bottlenose dolphins they keep at this resort. When I arrived, I did not have a strong opinion on the keeping of ocean mammals one way or another. My wife however, was quite distributed – from the moment we arrived. My thought was of all things man does to animals, this is probably the most benign. I spent some time researching this subject while at the resort. While one can find pros and cons on both sides of the issue, after a good deal of reading and looking at these amazing animals, my feeling on this issue was revised. I no longer find it acceptable to keep animals such as these for our entertainment. Swimming with them in captivity is just not OK. Its actually quite sad to walk by these dolphins on your way to and from the beach and restaurants. That said; please do your own research on the topic. For us, and for this reason alone, we will never again return to the Kahala.","Seattle, Washington","MichaelRSEA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",19,4.0

I was visiting Oahu with my family and I'm from Maui. The rooms were nice and the whole facility was good. Coming from Hawaii we wanted to just relax, stay at the beach, and let the kids play for the weekend.Seaside grill had pretty good food, Kainoa at the bar gave us awesome service and was always happy. I was truly impressed by the manager at Seaside Grill. She was wearing a wrist brace and I swear she was working harder than her workers! Overall they gave good service! The pool staff is probably the hardest working guys in the whole hotel! They are running around in the sun, moving heavy furniture, and giving out great service! Kainoa, Jacob, Rand, Nick, and Brent treated my family like ohana. They really gave off that local vibe and took care of my kids! One worker that does not belong there is another Nick (he didn't have a mustache), but that guy looks extremely mad and unapproachable ALL THE TIME and I even saw him get mad at the oldest co-worker and let the co-worker set up the beach by himself. He just didn't fit in with the group of having positive vibes.The reason why we chose this hotel was we heard they had great service, and I feel overall the hotel did a good job. People come to hawaii for the beach and I feel that the equipment at the beach area can be improved. Even the pool is outdated and not to mention the huge puddle of water by the drain. When visiting Oahu again, I will come back to The Kahala. I can see why others may want to visit Aulani or Halekulani...","Lahaina, Hawaii","Derek F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lahaina, Hawaii</strong>",2,4.0

Those guys work very hard and all the furniture that they move day in and day out, I give them a lot of credit! Of all the workers one gentlemen came off was very lazy, he was the eldest of the group. it seemed as though he avoided guest service. Another thing that stood out to me was how the pool was kept.

Bottom line for me – wonderful resort setting and luxury service, but it could really use some fresh, upscale interiors. It’s the only true resort near Waikiki, complete with a peaceful relaxed atmosphere, long stretch of picturesque beachfront and lots of well-manicured outdoor space. The 10 minute drive from the crowded Waikiki scene was a welcomed escape – it felt like Hawaii should. I had a great morning jog around Diamond Head through the upscale neighborhood along Kahala Avenue with the scent of plumeria in the air. Upon my return, I really appreciated the hotel staff’s spirit of aloha when a bellman handed me a water and the front desk clerk offered me a wet mint cloth. That gracious service will bring me back. Good (but expectedly expensive) buffet. I didn’t swim with the dolphins but there were plenty of families who did. The ponds with tropical fish and turtles were cool. The hotel was clean throughout. My standard king room was huge and the bathroom was majestic – his and hers sinks on opposite ends, more mirrors than Versailles, separate tub and Niagara Falls-like shower. Although I only had a peekaboo ocean view, my garden view room overlooked the Waialae Country Club which was lush and green.My one real complaint is that while I paid an exorbitant amount for a last minute reservation in order to be close to business associates, I was disappointed that the hotel was physically fairly outdated. I wouldn’t have a problem paying more if the lobby, public areas and guest rooms were freshened up. My bathroom had plastic towel rods, old sink fixtures and a plastic chrome ceiling grid fluorescent light. The main pool area was particularly mediocre. Many other 1960’s era Hawaiian hotels have been updated to meet guest expectations; the Kahala feels like it needs a similar facelift.

Highlights: spa, spacious lanai with seating/overall décor, friendly staff.I have been to high end spas before and usually like the treatments but slightly resent the high price tag. The Kahala spa was amazing! I received incredible multi-hour treatments both days of my stay. The treatment rooms are gorgeous; the treatments were well-executed; the staff were friendly and unpretentious. Totally worth it!The décor of the hotel seems Hawaii meets Southern charm. This is not a huge sprawling resort and feels intimate. I loved the large lanai with rocking chairs overlooking the ocean- perfect for a book. I would love to return for afternoon tea service in the dining room. I didn't do the Dophin Quest experience (swimming with dolphins) but I enjoyed watching the dolphins, stingrays, and turtles in their respective ponds.The beach is private (unlike Waikiki), although small. Like all of the Waikiki area, the beach quality is OK but underwhelming; the best beaches on Oahu don't have hotels. The water is rather shallow which might be nice for kids or weak swimmers. Also, there are only a few rocks in the water which is a blessing.Location: The Kahala is private and not located exactly in Waikiki, but it's quite close. There might be a shuttle available (I'm not sure). It is close to Hanauma Bay (a favorite place for snorkeling-get there early if you need parking); also, try climbing Koko Head- it's a great workout and ends with amazing views.Food: There are several restaurants including an Asian inspired venue, Italian, and a more American focused (surf and turf) restaurant. I only ate at Plumeria House (surf/turf); the service and food were great. The prices were as expected at a resort.My room was lovely, clean and comfortable with good space and storage.The pool looked enjoyable although a bit small.I really enjoyed my stay.","Fairbanks, Alaska","Lmb2000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fairbanks, Alaska</strong>",27,4.0

James even helped us take some family pictures in the hotel's beautiful lobby. The hotel staff was always very friendly and attentive with ever-ready smiles. I would rate the Plumeria's breakfast brunch as the best we have ever enjoyed at any hotel by a long, long distance. I would definitely recommend getting the breakfast package to all guests. The views from the Plumeria of the beach and the ocean only attended to the very enjoyable brunch there. The complimentary hotel shuttle to Waikiki and the Kahala Mall was always very helpful and ran on schedule. I would also recommend the outrigger canoeing experience with the hotel's excellent lifeguard Gabriel. It was a very enjoyable experience. The dolphin lagoon with the six dolphins was brilliant fun!

About 15 minutes out of Waikiki, it's located at the end of an affluent neighborhood on a golf course with a small near private beach. So you feel relatively secluded, was the perfect place to relax in peace without the chaos normally associated with hotels in Honolulu.

My only comment would be that as a return guest at other hotels, we usually receive some time of welcome amenity, but we didn't receive one here (we did when we stayed at the Halekulani earlier in our trip).

The rooms are very comfortable and the hotel is fairly well kept up. It has a secluded feel to it given the proximity to Honolulu. The beach is rarely crowded but the small pool is very crowded. The only complaints we have are in regards to the timelines of their housekeeping. We had our room cleaned while we were at the pool with the ""Do No Disturb"" sign up..

This place is wonderful. We traveled in May 2015 with our 22 month old daughter.ROOM: We had a second floor room overlooking the dolphin lagoon and it was excellent. A little crowded with the crib, but still plenty big. We were able to escape onto the patio with food and drinks after putting our daughter to bed at night. Other reviewers have complained about the rooms being dated, but we did not have any similar complaints. Our room was modern and clean. The crib was nice and clean, with a soft blanket for our daughter - and a sweet little stuffed turtle for her to keep.BEACH: Excellent. Quiet, private, small waves for the little ones, plenty big, not crowded. We also spent a lot of time at the pool, the baby pool, looking at the sea turtles and the fish, and watching the dolphins. There is also a lot of green space near the beach for a little one to run free.FOOD: Excellent. We had several meals at Plumeria and they were all excellent. The host routinely sat us outside on the patio closest to the garden/beach so our daughter could wander a bit. The brunch, though expensive, is worth every penny. We also had several meals at the Seaside Grill. This was a little disappointing for the money, but still fine. In every restaurant though -- the service was excellent and SUPER accommodating of our toddler. If you venture off property, check out Diamondhead Market. Don't be frightened by the ordering/eating in the parking lot -- the food is amazing! We also enjoyed the shaved ice at Waiola.SERVICE: Not much to add here as other travelers have said it well. The service is outstanding - from the housekeepers, to the restaurant staff, to the check-in desk, to the pool/beach crew, to the valet (who stocked us up with waters and towels before we headed to the north shore with some friends).",Chicago,"Mona G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago</strong>",33,5.0

We were greeted with beautiful fresh leis on arrival and a gaggle of bellmen surrounded our car and unloaded it as one of them escorted us to the front desk, where the clerk asked if we were celebrating anything special. He offered to send up a cake for my son's birthday when he learned that's why we were there. We got an upgraded room that was literally on the golf course -- a nice patio with two padded chaise lounges to relax and enjoy the beauty. I'm sure there are balconies/lanais with views of Diamond Head crater or the ocean on request.Our luggage actually arrived at our room before we did -- our bellman gave us the grand tour and offered to set up our luggage to unpack.Beds: My notorious bed snobbery, that can usually be satisfied only by Marriott beds was taken to a new level. I literally considered never leaving that bed... not even after my credit card was maxed out and the police summoned. It was that awesome. I finally decided against my sleep in because I want to come back. The linens were equally top notch. For that reason Beds: 6/5Cleanliness: I am also a freak about clean and this gets my rare OMG clean award. In fact, while I'm at it, let me tell you that the number one thing that impressed me most about this resort was the maid service. It was spectacular. They all get a raise. I know you can afford it. For example, I had dumped my makeup bag looking for tweezers or something that had gotten lost right before we headed out to eat (we got in sort of late) without thinking about the evening turn down service.... only to return to all my items neatly organized on a towel. They were meticulous about replacing amenities every visit, I just can't say enough wonderful things about the housekeeping staff. Cleanliness 6/5Amenities: Here's a hotel that gets those little touches that make you feel better about shelling out a wad for a hotel room -- slippers, robes, Starbucks coffee (that they keep stocked!), an up-to-date coffeemaker, water, there were bath salts, lotions, any toiletry item you might night right at your disposal -- including a dental kit if your luggage got lost or you forgot to pack ye ole toothbrush. The bathroom was stunning -- his and her sinks, a tub that I could lay down in that also had a spray arm for rinsing off or washing your hair... An amazing shower, a water closet a magnifying mirror... if you're older and blinder you know how important this is but now I need a LIGHTED ONE folks... even magnified isn't enough anymore! But one at all is definitely awesome. The amenities don't stop with the room... there's dolphins... that's right DOLPHINS swimming around in the pool (their own, not the main pool) sea turtles, a sting ray and other sea life. While there is a charge to get in the water with them (at least if it's a planned excursion and not a drunken dare) you can certainly enjoy them from the deck at no cost. Then there's paddle board and surfing lessons... they offer an intro less of about 15 minutes at no cost -- the instructor was so nice to my son and spent extra time with him just because he was the only one. No microwave, though... maybe some rooms do have them.Amenities: 6/5Food: 24 hour room service. Need I say more? The prices weren't that much more than what the restaurants offered. There is also a bar and grill on the beach (my only real negative is that it didn't stay open very late which was disappointing as I enjoy hanging out late afternoon with a cocktail and snacks on the beach.) We had breakfast outside at Plumeria. They offer a buffet but we dined from the menu -- French toast with coconut syrup was quite excellent as was the corned beef hash. It was surprising though that the servers didn't clear the tables right away and that cleared dishes were left out on stands that attracted birds -- some of the patrons seemed to be unhappy with that.Room comfort: The AC worked and you could crank it down if you wanted to be cool and it actually gets cool. The flatscreen TV had good reception and you could angle it if you wanted to watch from the bed. There was a nice settee to watch TV, or just chill on. The desk and chair was a bit of a mismatch -- I found the desk uncomfortable for typing from the chair height and it wasn't adjustable. On the plus side, the wifi worked great here, so that helped with business. They also have a nice business center -- it's located in a suite. Noise was an occasional factor, but it's the doorbells that causes the problem. The adjoining room people arrived late and I got woken up by their door bell, knocking, bellmen deliver luggage, food, etc. over a period of about an hour. Maybe after a certain time, one could avoid the doorbell. Also it would be a good idea to check in latecomers next to an empty room, but of course that might not be possible if the hotel is at capacity. Comfort 4.9/5Spa: I got a discount spa coupon on check-in so I expected that it should be easy enough to get a same day appointment and it was. Looking at the prices might dissuade some people from trying the spa (I'm guess the coupon was incentive to make the leap) but without a doubt, that was the best facial I ever had in my life. Weeks later my skin is still glowing. Facials are sometimes uncomfortable because of the skill level of the esthetician -- but not once was anything less than perfect -- she even worked on my eyelids. The treatment rooms are huge, not the typical little closets that most therapy sessions take place in. I am definitely coming back and treating myself to a spa day in the near future.

For those that are on a budget, definitely splurge and get the breakfast buffet at Plumeria Beachhouse at least once. It is SO good!!!

I don't understand how anyone can give this place a negative review. What I especially love about this place is that it feels like you're on a remote island that happens to be 10 minutes away from Waikiki. I went over the Memorial Day weekend and it was busy, but somehow they make you feel like you're the only guest they have. Everyone knows your name by the 2nd day. They really feel like a family. And everyone I spoke with that worked there acted like they were a family. The hotel was bought recently and everyone there is excited about the new ownership, hoping they can be even better. I do wish they did more Hawaiian stuff, like other hotels do. Maybe have a band playing local music with some hula dancers out by the ocean. Other than that I'm not sure what else they can do. I stayed on the 10th floor with a full ocean view. I think next time I go, I will request a partial ocean view. The scenery over the mountains is very cool and the weather changes - or looks like it's changing constantly. I got a facial in the spa and it was very nice. All the people that work there are so welcoming and it's so relaxing. They have rocking chairs everywhere at the resort, which I love. Only one hammock, which is my one nit pick, I wish there were a few more. Had dinner at Hoku's which was great. The breakfast buffet was included in my plan and it's consistently good. The waitresses always knew my name and would sometimes recommend something they liked and even bring it over to me! Most nights I would take the free shuttle into town. (Make a reservation and don't forget to tip your driver) I never really made the free shuttle back so I would take Uber. It averaged around $14 from town. The slight problem I had with those drivers is they heavily relied on the GPS and didn't really know where to go without it. One time I was at the Royal Hawaiian and it took the driver awhile to find me. You could do Uber taxi which costs the same as a taxi (although no tip is necessary.) They're just taxis that are now with Uber and these guys know where they're going. Now back to the Kahala, I don't really know what else to say about this place except I really can't wait to come back!","New York City, New York","Bryan F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",41,5.0

My profile picture was taken from one of the beach cabanas years ago.The high points:The hotel's location away from the hustle and bustle is really key. You can get into Waikiki easily if you want but the resort itself is peaceful and relaxing.We stayed in an Ocean Front Suite which was amazing. (You can check out my prior reviews if you want more room detail. Or message me.)We ate at all the restaurants. Hoku's is good but we haven't been wowed by it. However, the short ribs and Ahi Musubi off the appetizer menu are a must try. As an FYI, you can order off of the menu for Hoku's in the Veranda. Drink and appetizers are perfect.We love the breakfast buffet at Plumeria - the pecan buns, Kahalasadas and thin pancakes are the best. We ate at the Italian restaurant (Arancino) twice. The Waygu Bolognese was excellent.We had massages and I think this is my favorite spa ever (we have tried a lot of them). The staff at the spa is hands down (no pun intended) the best. They remember us year after year which is impressive. Extremely relaxing massages. The tables are super comfortable - the whole experience is wonderful. The IT team was extremely helpful. We brought our Apple TV and Cameron in IT got us connected immediately. He was incredibly nice and helpful. Areas for improvement:Again, we love this place, but even we have to admit that their general customer service is not what it could be which is frustrating given how much we love the hotel!I think prior reviews have commented that there is a charge for everything. On this trip we did feel like if we didn't pay for something, we didn't get it. And even if we did pay, some things might not have been worth it.During prior stays, all suites included the suite amenity program. They seem to have changed it such that unless you stay in a signature suite, the program is an add on. Because we do want the breakfast and cabana use, we booked the add on. But other aspects of it are a bit spotty. They don't walk you through it and you are left to figure it out on your own. If you book the add on, make sure you call room service at the start of your visit to set up your afternoon drinks and your morning coffee. Reception did not facilitate that process at all. We also found that the appetizers that came with the add-on program were rather underwhelming as compared to prior stays. We didn't even bother with the morning coffee and just went to the coffee station that they set up each day in the lower lobby.This trip was for our 20th anniversary, a fact which was highlighted to the hotel prior to our stay. At this caliber (and price) of hotel, I do expect some sort of gesture of acknowledgement and, quite frankly, the Kahala is the only hotel that has now repeatedly failed at this aspect. No upgrade, no champagne, not even a ""Congratulations"" from the hotel (the restaurants were good at this). Really? Again, if you didn't pay for it, you don't get it.Bear in mind that we stayed here immediately after the Halekulani which has some of the best customer service we have ever experienced worldwide. That is hard to measure up to, but I think the Kahala could and should do better.Enough of the negative! This really is a great property and we will go back for another laid back stay. Definitely give it a try if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki.","Orange County, California","SarahInSoCal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",166,5.0

Our room was very clean and the bedding was of excellent quality with plenty of pillows. Our housekeeper was very nice and gladly left us extra coffee upon request. The alarm clock with latest IPhone connection was convenient for listening to music and charging my phone. In general, the staff is friendly, smiling and very helpful...must say thanks again to Taylor in The Veranda for her excellent recommendations and great attitude.This a a great place to stay overall but here are a few things that need improvement.My partner arrived a day earlier than I did and he was greeted with a welcome and a lei. I showed up the next day and got neither. Maybe I just missed ""Lei day"" but for consistency, it would have been nice to get the same greeting.At the pool, service was spotty and it was difficult to find someone to give you a towel. I'd have preferred they just place a pile of them in one location for everyone to grab as needed. This item may be just my own personal issue but the dolphins on the premises make me feel sad. They live in a pretty small space compared to the ocean that they could be living in just several yards away.

We had an issue with our bill which also took multiple conversations to resolve.These, I guess are admin issues but the bedding was a major one and very disappointing we never were called to resolve for us during our 3 night stay.The resort itself is truly beautiful and the location is what really sets it apart from other leading resorts such as The Halekulani.Having the dolphin lagoon is amazing and offers a real unique aspect to your stay here.Having swam with many sea turtles in Hawaii I did find it a little sad to see sea turtles in a very small pond, but perhaps they are happy, although it seems almost cruel to me.The buffet breakfast here is below world class and well below expectations and has no soul.The omelet and egg station is great but the rest is very poor indeed.Perhaps most people have breakfast as their rate so the Kahala doesn't see the need to be world class in this area which is a shame, as something like this will make people stay elsewhere in the future.We had read many people in their reviews saying how small the pool is, and sure it's not huge but it was more than ok - although we were there in off peak season, so I could see it being painful to get a seat in summer for example.The beach and bay is simply stunning.The free wifi was the worst I have uncounted in any resort on the planet as it drops out constantly and you are not aware it has dropped out, and then you have to re log in, which we had to do approx 10 times a day over just a few hours in the room - simply useless.*We all had this issue regardless of device etc.I can be hard to please (as my wife tells me often) but having been lucky enough to travel across the world there are certain expectations you come to expect when staying AND paying for a resort such as The Kahala and although it truly is beautiful it is expensive and does need some more love and attention.","Sydney, Australia","444Scott444</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",334,4.0

The experience took a dramatic turn when the person at the front desk told us we would not have a King size bed because we did not ""request"" one upon booking. It was not so much WHAT she said, but the WAY she said it. Somewhat condescending and leaving the distinct impression that the satisfaction of other customers was more important than ours. NOT good news when you are on your anniversary. The room was nice but when I turned on the light it flickered like a strobe light in a disco. My wife was very unhappy. I called to talk to the Manager but he was ""busy"" with others. After a while he called me and we were given a significant upgrade to a beachfront room with lanai; but had to pay an additional $250. At first I was a bit put out but came to find that the room they gave me was quite a bit more expensive than our original booking and the $250 was a fantastic bargain. Perhaps the complimentary bottle of Champagne helped too!We ate at Hoku's and the food was good but the service was incredible. The lady who served us helped so much with the pairing of the wines with our meal and great options for going through the menu. She made the experience so much better and even gave us a complimentary dessert with candles for our anniversary.We also invited friends for the seafood buffet at the Plumeria, it was simply outstanding! We all enjoyed the great selection of food and wine list was great too. It was a wonderful and memorable evening for us all.The beautiful and SECURE beach was relaxing beyond compare and unlike the rest of the island where you get a ticket for drinking at the beach, they have a wonderful beach/poolside bar.We will definitely visit again and if it had not been for that one person at Check In it would have easily been a five star experience.","Sasebo, Japan","Khamkeo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sasebo, Japan</strong>",74,4.0

Most offensive is the non slip rubber strips in the bathtub which are almost black. One look and we knew that we would not be using the bathtub.

While the public areas look great, the rooms lost their Hawaii feel and overall impact. The new look is more Santa Monica than Hawaii, and the furnishings, walls and carpets don't wear well. I will never understand why the iconic parquet flors were covered-up with wall-to-wall carpeting. The carpets just get stained, smell musty and make the rooms feel less grand. Despite the generous room size, there is insufficient (and cheap) furniture and nowhere comfortable to sit - other than the bed. Finally, the bathrooms, which were very nicely redone in the mid-90's for the Mandarin Oriental, are showing age and do not match the decor of the rooms. With some surface renovations in the bathrooms, new furniture and exposing the old floors (which hopefully are still under the carpets), the rooms again could rival the best anywhere.",Honolulu,"Frank L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu</strong>",3,4.0

Tripadvisor, Jetsetter and even Andrew Harper ranked this property very high, so we went on the advice of all that research and with high expectations. We were also travelling with another couple and they too saw the high ratings of this hotel. Sadly, none of us will be returning to the Kohala as we were disappointed. When we booked, we reserved a partial ocean view room. When we entered the room it was clearly a mountain view room, and we asked to change rooms. Granted, if you stood on the balcony on a stool and leaned way over and looked far right you might have seen a sliver of ocean in the distance. This room however did not match the picture printout we had with us of a partial ocean view from the hotel website. They changed our room to an ocean front room. The room was very nice, roomy and bright. But, there was a huge parking garage in front of this ocean view.We were ok until the second morning of our stay. We had booked the bed and breakfast package which included daily breakfast at Plumeria restaurant and this was confirmed at check-in. They even handed me a printout about this breakfast package and it all looked nice. When we arrived for breakfast on the second morning, we were told by a man with a snotty attitude that we needed a reservation for breakfast and he would not seat us. He repeated this several times and told us to try our luck getting a seat at the bar to eat. We ate here yesterday--no problems. Now, if a reservation was necessary why wasn't I told I needed a reservation? It wasn't stated on that printout I was given at check-in. Or why didn't they offer to make a reservation for me since the breakfast package was included in my reservation? The Kohala is in a residential neighborhood, so there are no other nearby restaurants or even a Starbucks to go to if your hotel refuses to seat you. But, we were able to grab 4 seats at the bar after a brief wait and ordered breakfast. Danny and Freddy took good care of us there, and they were so helpful and kind--thank you to you both. The valet and bell staff were also superb here. We have stayed at other properties in Honolulu and this is not a bad hotel (especially if this is your first visit to Oahu), but it is not close to being the best either. It was built in the 1950s, has a small pool area and is far away from everything. And for us ....

It is expensive, but worth every penny. Get the best room your budget will allow, you won't regret it. The service is spot on, attentive,and prompt, without being intrusive. At check-in, I discovered that I had not reserved a room with a lanai. I asked if I could pay to upgrade, none were available. They offered me an upgrade to a suite at a reasonable up charge. We took it, it was worth every penny.Regardless, the rooms are great, large bathrooms, double sinks, separate bath and shower, large closets, great beds and pillows. Turn down service and 2 bottles of water per day and free internet. We had the breakfast buffet included with our room, I would Reccomend doing that, but if you don't, have the breakfast buffet at least 1 day. It is one of the few hotel breakfast buffets that is worth it from a quality and variety offering. Everything from American style to European style, to Japanese style cuisine. Fresh fruits and baked goods, etc etc.All of the restaurants on premises are excellent from casual light fare to fine dining with a dress code at Hoku. We never left the premises for 5 days, except to visit Pearl Harbor and the Arizona memorial.If you reported something needed fixing they didn't just note it, they fixed or replaced it immediately. We had a cappuccino machine in our suite( surprisingly). We love coffee so we used it quite a bit. The 3rd day it broke. I told the front desk, they reacted like it was really important. I didn't expect anything to happen. We came back from the beach, it was replaced and ready to go!Speaking of the beach and pool areas, they are quiet, relaxing and well kept. Plenty of space and chairs, and food and drink service. And believe it or not, for Oahu and a luxury resort, the prices were fair.

It is the perfect location – sheltered in a beautiful bay in a quiet neighborhood, very tranquil and beautiful. Yet, a short drive, not even on highways, to Honolulu, should you want a taste of shopping, restaurants, and other “action.” The staff could not be friendlier. The amenities are gracious, with several good restaurants on the grounds, and the scenery is spectacular. There’s a reason that it is chosen as the location for wedding photo shoots every weekend. Having dolphins, turtles and other sea life on the premises adds another dimension of interest. The guests embody the fact that the Hawaiian Islands are almost equidistant from the East and the U.S. mainland. The feel is very international. At the same time, there were many guests with young children. It is very family friendly. I have given our room less than 5 stars because it was a little dark. (We had a room on the ground floor by the dolphin pools.) On the other hand, it was spacious and very convenient.We enjoyed our stay immensely and hope to return soon.","Burlington, Vermont","Olivia7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burlington, Vermont</strong>",13,5.0

He and I went solo and LOVED everything! We loved it so much (and felt guilty for not taking the kids the first time) we returned a year later to celebrate his 50th birthday with our two teenage children. Although it was a different experience with the kids the second time, The Kahala still fit our needs perfectly. PROSThe buffet breakfast is ridiculous. I seriously gained 5 pounds during our recent spring break stay. The beach is super quiet. If there were non-hotel guests there, we didn't know it. All beaches in Hawaii are public beaches, but The Kahala is very quiet compared to the ones in Waikiki. It is a quick 10 minute drive to Waikiki which is great for shopping and people watching. We rented a car for the week as part of our travel package and it was totally worth it. There is a hotel shuttle which my daughter and I used as well. It was very convenient. The service is top-notch! Everyone is very accommodating and just a phone call away. The fish, dolphins, and turtles were fun to watch as well. CONS$20 upgrade fee (daily) for premium wireless, optional of course. My daughter said the free version was slow. I did use one day of the premium on our last day to download movies on my iPad for our plane ride back home. $75 fee (daily) for a roll-a-way bed. My son slept on the upholstered lounge chair in the room for free. The housekeeping staff gave us extra sheets and blankets. The resort food is expensive. We went to Times Supermarket, which is a five minute drive away to pick up breakfast (on the mornings we didn't do the buffet) and lunch items, and snacks. We had dinner in Waikiki most nights or wherever we had driven to sight-see for the day. The Kahala is an upscale resort for more wealthy individuals so we knew what costs were involved when we planned the trip. Just wanted to make others aware via this review. If money is not an issue for you, then The Kahala is completely perfect for you!! Although most people with loads of money are probably not reading Trip Advisor - somebody else plans their trips for them. ;)Overall, we loved it and still give it five stars even though it is expensive. You get what you pay for. We just tried to watch our spending. BTW, my husband and son played golf at Turtle Bay. It is a wonderful course, but the resort itself doesn't compare to The Kahala. It has a very big, busy resort feel (I toured it while they were playing golf), whereas The Kahala feels like home. I will never stay anywhere else on Oahu unless I move there!","Durham, North Carolina","beach224</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Durham, North Carolina</strong>",15,5.0

Highlight of this property is the location and grounds. No craziness like Waikiki, just a stone's throw away. The ocean is calm due to tasteful made breakwaters. Pool is small and more for kids, but with the excellent beach, let the kids have it. Rooms can either face the ocean or the mountain behind. We were hoping for a mountain view, but we were on fist floor with a large tree. Suggest you be specific about what you have in mind. A last item is the dolphins. Could have watched them all day.

I find it difficult to pick out anything to complain about. Maybe I could complain about ""not being able to find something to complain about"". Even the guests were delightful.

If you have ever stayed in Waikiki, you know how crowded it is, and this is totally the opposite. The water here seems to be warmer, maybe because it is a lot more shallow, and during low tide, you can actually walk out a quarter mile and still be standing! Water shoes are recommended. This resort has a dolphin quest, where you can learn about them, and swim with them in small groups. It was really enjoyable. Most everyone here in Hawaii are friendly and nice, but here at Kahala, they seem to really take it to the next level. It all starts at the valet, where they make you feel as if they are there to do all the work for you and take care of your every need. If you call down before you need your car, it is there when you get out front. This is the first hotel that upon check in, we received a lei and a cold towel. A short while after we checked in, we received a call from the manager on duty, excusing himself for not being there when we arrived to greet us! Unbelievable! This is where Kings and Queens stay, and they treat you as such! We ate dinner at Hoku's. A five star restaurant where the service and food are great. If you like musubi, try the signature appetizer, an ahi musubi, cut in four. Really pretty large and to-die-for! I loved it. For lunch, try Plumeria, and get a table on the patio or inside on the rail. The view is really nice and relaxing. The hamburger with an egg was my favorite. The assistant front service manager, Sahng Woo Chun, was really outstanding! He actually took the time to take me up to a two bedroom ocean front suite, so I would know what to expect the next time.

Plumeria and the Seaside Grill also had excellent food and service. The service at the Seaside Grill is a bit more laid back.We did the dolphin adventure and that was outstanding - so much fun and such talented staff and of course the dolphins are so smart! There are stingrays, turtles and tons of fish in a couple of pools along the walkways.There are a couple of things to think about regarding the facilities - the pool is a bit small and although it wasn't that crowded in the pool - scoring chairs around the pool depends on the time of day if you need more than 2 (there were 4 of us and we all like our own chair). We bought ""water shoes"" for the beach because the coral reef is close to the shore and the sand is a bit muddy. We rented two rooms and required them to be connecting - there was a daily fee for this - I certainly don't understand why - it just doesn't fit with the rest of the experience and is the small amount of revenue worth upsetting a guest over?I didn't consider the previous 3 observations to be significant - just something to be aware of.","New Providence, New Jersey, United States","Mike J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Providence, New Jersey, United States</strong>",95,5.0

It made me think of our trip last March to Honolulu and our stay at the Kahala that I never reviewed! Better late than never! Just 15 minutes from crazy Waikiki is this beautiful resort. It has its own private beach and 5 star amenities. It has the island's only swim with dolphins encounter which was a highlight for our 2 daughters. We rented a car on site at Hertz (convenient but indifferent staff and not full time service) and drove around the Island, to Pearl Harbour and into Waikiki a few times. Great place to visit but would not want to stay at the very crowded hotels and beach! Breakfast buffet at Plumeria was amazing. Huge offering and such a beautiful setting especially sitting outside. Unfortunately, given the Kahala's location, you have to eat on site unless you drive into Waikiki or elsewhere. There is a regular shuttle but the drive home takes quite a long time due to stops. Our favourite on-site restaurant was Arancino where we had dinner twice - pricey but delicious Italian fare. Plumeria was fair for dinner and the Vernanda was nice for drinks but not great for food (slow and inexperienced staff). The restaurants could do a better job with their children's offerings all around, especially as it is such a family friendly hotel. The hotel was not super busy for March break (everyone was in Florida?!) so lots of chairs by the pool and on the beach. They didn't nickel and dime you for extras like a lot of resorts do. No resort fee, for example. Included in rate was Plumeria's amazing buffet breakfast for 2 (or 1 adult and 2 kids), Wi-Fi, newspapers, pool and beach towels and loungers etc. Concierge made us reservations at the Hilton Luau which was a real highlight (you don't go for the food though!).

We flew in a couple of days early and stayed two nights at the Kahala. I chose this property because I didn't want the hustle and chaos that I've heard can be the norm when staying on Waikiki Beach. We drove up by shuttle bus at night and saw lit torches(which for whatever reason I hoped we'd see) and the glowing lights from the beautiful chandeliers in the lobby(I took so many pics of them from different angles I couldn't get enough). We were greeted with leis and proceeded to check in. They were gracious enough to upgrade us to a mountain view balcony from the basic room we had which was greatly appreciated. The balcony was spacious and we had a nice, scenic view of the neighboring neighborhood(was slightly annoyed by the groundskeeper weed whacking in the early morning from the golf course located behind the hotel however). The room was comfortable and tastefully appointed. We appreciated the iPod docking station next to the bed. The bathroom was very spacious but showed its age/dated and could definitely stand a refresh. We ate both mornings at the Plumeria Beach House breakfast buffet. I was somewhat disappointed. For the price I expected something more spectacular. There was a great selection to choose from and nice presentation but for whatever reason, it fell short. I also had expected a variety of fresh squeezed juices to be included in the price, they weren't. The view while dining was very tranquil. The sliding doors were open so we got lots of light and fresh air. The beach was quiet and clean. The water was very calm and relaxing. Beautiful scenery to be had from every vantage point. Also, the complimentary coffee/tea station each morning was a nice touch. We only wished they would've kept it open a bit longer. Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our experience.

It is nestled in an area of million dollar homes and exudes class.The beach is one of the best around. White sand stretches on forever. It is one of the few beaches with lawn chairs out at water's edge. The pool attendants set up your pool chairs. Pool towels are huge and luxurious.The staff are friendly and helpful. After the first day everyone greeted me by name! When I had a problem one night the manager asked if he could come straight to the room to be sure things were resolved to our satisfaction. We used valet service for our car and found our car was delivered in less than 2 minutes on each occasion. On the flip side, the pool is very small. However, they have another pool for kiddies that is huge by kid pool standards! The pool was a comfortable temperature. There are trees around the pool and it was quite windy so there was debris in the pool.Rooms are large with huge bathrooms. Compared to Waikiki Beach they are enormous. You have both a soaker bathtub and a shower along with separate sinks and vanities. Toiletries are excellent. Besides the standard items there was a razor, toothbrush and toothpaste, etc. The TV was large with a great picture. However, there were a limited number of channels. Actually, the least I have ever had on this island. They promoted their pay per view movies rather than providing channels we could watch on our own.The hotel offers bicycles and suggests walking the area or walking the beach. I didn't see any other activities. The hotel has Dolphin quest onsite. Prices were steep, but swimming with the dolphins is a once in a lifetime experience. Everyone at the Dolphin Quest was very nice.Rooms have doorbells. I don't know why, except it makes them different than most. We had neighbors who had a lot of guests, until very late at night, so the doorbell was annoying. However, the staff advised us the next day that they had checked out and if they hadn't they would certainly have moved us to another room.The 10th floor is the top floor. However, that is the floor that allows smoking. We were on the 9th floor and moved down to the 7th to be away from the smoke.The dolphin rooms are in a 2 story complex surrounding the dolphins. This area is best for families. The ocean view was limited, but the lowest level rooms walked out onto the grounds.We took the shuttle into Waikiki. Roundtrip it took almost 3 hours from door to door. There was a wait for the shuttle to come, then it was 20 minutes to the stop. The return trip was 40 minutes once we were on the shuttle. Traffic was bad, and we had to make a stop at the Ala Moana shopping center before returning to the hotel. Not bad for a complimentary shuttle service, but much slower than the 10 minutes the staff said it would take each way. Just FYI.I have stayed in all the hotels at Waikiki Beach and this was on par with them. For people looking for solitude I don't think you could do better. Our visit was during very heavy winds which made it impossible to spend time at the beach, biking, walking, or even being outdoors much. This corner of the island grabs the wind more, I believe, since there was no wind when we went to Waikiki in the evening. This property is very exclusive and very expensive. There is no resort fee, but there are also very limited activities offered in comparison to hotels which do have resort fees. Overall a great experience. I look forward to returning again when the wind isn't quite so strong.","Seattle, Washington","DebbieR247</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",63,4.0

That aside, it is a nice quiet location and ocean views are just what you would expect--though higher floors more towards the ends of the wings tend to give better views, and you will have to contend with either noise from the pools or noise from the front entrance traffic. The higher the better to avoid all of that. However, upgrades and room changes are hit or miss, so ask early and check often. The staff is courteous, if distant, and I don't know that I was expecting a genie in a bottle for my $800 a night, but there was some lack of efficiency and ""blurry vision"" towards guests. That being said, the Kahala has a lot to overcome with all the terrible Oahu traffic, fast pace and over-commercialization of this island. Sure, its tropical, but I don't know that I felt like I was in Hawaii. When I fly 12 hours to get here, maybe I expected a bit more ""aloha spirit""...? We ate at Arancino's with at least three tables of crying screaming children in the background--which you can't fault them for, but definitely took away from the gourmet meal and gourmet prices. The beach needs maintenance, but was nice and shallow, and easy to go in the water. Rooms were pretty (if a bit in need of updating-particularly the bathrooms), beds are wonderful, robes were GREAT.

I discovered that I was not too far from the laundry for the resort! Sigh-just my luck (even after asking for a quiet room).

From the moment you arrive, and greeters meet you with fresh leis, you are treated to pristine surroundings and, for the most part, outstanding service and amenities.It's hard to beat the beach at the Kahala - white sand, turquoise water, and an abundance of activities keeps you mesmerized.We were drawn to the ocean on a daily basis, walked out on the coral reefs to explore, and canoed through the calm waters. We also fished off the reefs, and caught Cornet and Sergeant Majors and released them back into the balmy sea.There are four restaurants at The Kahala. The food is most spectacular at AranCino (although we didn't dine at Hoku's, which we understand is also award-winning). But seriously, being from an Italian family, my husband and I like to think we know good Italian food. And AranCino did not disappoint. We tried the Tasting Menu and Mamma Mia, it was beyond creative and delicious. Staff at AranCino is also top-notch, especially Cirus. Ask for him when you go :).Staff at the hotel were also outstanding - polite, friendly and extremely helpful. We happened to run in to General Manager Carmine Iommazzo on our way to do some shopping at the Kahala Mall, and he offered to drive us to it! Thanks again, Carmine :).There are a couple of areas we think The Kahala could spruce up - the staff at the Seaside Grill and the Veranda are just not into it. They seem bored, uninspired and in our experience are not customer-service driven. The only other disappointment for us was - wait for it - the toilet paper. In a luxury resort like The Kahala, we expected a toilet paper to match. I know that's stretching it in terms of things to complain about but it seriously makes a big different to us. Other than that, the rooms are well appointed and spacious, and really make you feel like you are in paradise.Last but not least, the staff at the onsite Dolphin Quest are clearly highly qualified, professional and love what they do. As a general rule, we don't think Dolphins should be kept in captivity but we understand that the Dolphin Quest research program benefits dolphins in the wild and that their work helps rescue dolphins that have been injured.

My wife has a cigarette smoke allergy. That is the headline. Here is the full story.We live locally on Oahu. I planned an escape for me and my wife to celebrate her coming birthday as well as some desperately needed time alone (we have a 5 yr old and 9 yr old). Having never stayed on the Kahala coast before, I though The Kahala would be perfect. A VERY nice lady helped us get a good price on a room that would normally be well above our budget. During the conversation, she said she had given us an upgrade to a partial ocean view/golf course view (the Sony Open was this weekend) on a high floor. I said, ""great, thank you so much"". No mention of a smoking room or floor.Upon check in, another VERY nice person told us we had been given another upgrade to an Ocean View room on the 10th floor. We could not have been happier. No mention of this being a smoking room and a smoking floor.Everyone was so nice and the interior of the lobby was spectacular, though. We arrived at our room and as the door was opened I was hit with a pretty strong and nasty whiff of old cigarette. My wife entered and we sat down. The room was very, very nice. The bathroom, bed, decor and furniture were beautiful. The carpet looked in need of replacement and the couch was filthy around the bottom. The cigarette smell seemed to grow as we sat. My wife almost immediately began to itch and I sent her to the balcony as I called the front desk. I was surprised to find out they had a smoking floor (the 10th). I told them the situation and they immediately moved us to another room. Sadly, my wife's condition did not improve. It became clear we needed to leave and fast, before she needed to use her EpiPen. Another surprise was the manager saying we had not requested a NON SMOKING room on our reservation. I told him I did not think smoking was allowed in hotels anymore AND that I did not remember a place to choose either a smoking or non smoking room on the room reservation pages on line. He then said he was willing to not charge us for our second day but that he would have to charge us one day as we were inside their 72 hour cancellation window. I said that I could see that if we were simply changing our minds. However, no one told us we were going into a smoking room. The situation was directly related to this error - an error the hotel made, not us. I told him we had to go, no matter what. If he had to charge us, while i did not think it right nor fair, we would have to accept it as I needed to get my wife out of there ASAP (yes, we could faintly smell cigarettes even in the new room). As my wife began to panic, I raced her out of there. The manager said he could not make a final decision, as he needed to talk to a higher headquarters and he did not know if anyone would be there at this time of day. Left unasked was my question as to what good is being the manager if you cannot make decisions such as this one. I gave him my cell phone as I needed to know the final outcome as soon as possible. He finally called as we were driving home to ask if we wanted to accept their one day charge and they would give us a ""free"" night in the future - so long as it was within 3 months. After MUCH back and forth I finally convinced him that we would really just like our money back. My wife could not conceive of going back there and being able to relax, wondering if or when cigarette smoke would creep up and make her ill.Make of this what you will. I cannot say enough about how nice the reservation, bell, valet staff were. You can draw your own conclusions about the rest. We wont be back, sadly.","Kailua, Hawaii","HawaiiJohn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kailua, Hawaii</strong>",39,1.0

This is the 5th time I've stayed here and it loses a little luster year by year. I'll make this my last stay. There is a ton to do and it's great for a family. Golf next door holds a PGA Tour event. The private beach is great. The gym is small and run down for a hotel of this stature. The pool is a decent size and well maintained. There's an awesome experience of swimming with the Dolphins. With the rooms between over $400 you'd expect a lot of extras to be included but not here. You'll pay for WiFi. Approximately $35 a head for breakfast. Parking will set you back as well. There is a shuttle to the Kahala Mall which will help offset some expenses. My biggest complaint is a hidden policy I've never run into before. I stay in a hotel 150+ nights per year and this is a first. We booked for 6 days and informed the hotel two nights before that we would be checking out one day early. They charged us a full nights stay citing a 72 hour advance notice is required. That policy generally always points to the beginning part of the stay in case you are a total no show. The manager and reservation manger didn't budge and showed no compassion for the problem. It's the principle more than the money even though it's still a lot of money. I'd suggest to stay here for a night or two and then go to Waikiki where you'll at least be appreciated as a returning or new guest and get tons of affordable restaurants, shops & beaches.

I chose Oahu because of the many happy memories I have there, specifically the good times I had at the Kahala Hotel. I shared my excitement with several of my friends, who decided to join me in the celebration the week of October 19th. In addition to my stay, at my suggestion, 26 of my friends and family were all guests at this hotel. The rooms booked ranged from the Imperial and Presidential Suites to Beach Front and other room categories so I got to see many of the rooms aside from the one I was staying in. I personally had a confirmed reservation for an Ocean Front Suite made several months in advance of my arrival through the American Express Fine Hotel and Resorts Program, which this hotel participates in. Since we would be booking several rooms for the week, my travel coordinator suggested I reach out to the hotel's director of sales,Roger Bright to continue working with him to make arrangements for my other guest’s bookings. I spent six weeks trying to reach him, leaving numerous messages on his voice mail and with his co-workers, but never received a single call back from him over that time frame. I was told when Roger was traveling to LA, when he was at lunch, etc. and did my best to catch him around his schedule, to no avail. He never once returned my calls. (I would later ask him about this, and he stated his phone lines were out? For 6 weeks? If you are thinking of planning an event, destination wedding etc...at the Kahala , pay attention to this! You will get very frustrated trying to work with this property as they are not responsive. As the date of my arrival was closing in I was getting nervous about my event so I finally asked if there was someone else I could work with to finalize my plans and work through details of some logistics. This was when I met Jacob Keanaaina. Jacob was very nice and quite pleasant to deal with. I would not have guessed he was new at his job. A few days before my departure Jacob graciously informed me that because of all of the business I was brining to the hotel, he had taken the liberty of upgrading my room to one overlooking the dolphin lagoon, which he felt my 6 year old daughter would love. This had me believing everything was going to be great!After 13 ½ hours of flying, after months of planning with the hotel staff, when we arrived to this property, we were met by the news that not only did the hotel NOT have a reservation in my name, it did not even have a room for my family. They had lost my reservation! Despite holding a confirmed reservation in my hand for a one bedroom suite, we were told to wait in the lobby for more than 2 hours while the staff tried to figure out what went wrong. I spent those two hours looking around the lobby, noticing that this once lovely hotel isn't what it used to be. When we drove up, the first thing I saw was the old and tired looking stucco building was covered in scaffolding. It looked more like a tenement than a luxury resort. It surely is need of a facelift--inside and out. The lobby looked just old and tired. I have stayed at this hotel several times in the past and it just didn't have the same luster. The furniture in the lobby, which is more patio furniture than luxury lobby décor, sank in from overuse--it wasn't comfortable--it was awkward. It looks so 1960's dated. Not even retro cool. I found the staff was very aloof and unfriendly. I asked the concierge for the name of a car service and since I wasn't a registered hotel guest yet, she wouldn't give me that information! Not one person checked on us or offered any amenity while we waited. Our comfort wasn't their concern yet it was their error that placed us in this situation.  Several hours later, after attempting to downgrade me to a garden view standard room (they told me that's all they had available) we were in fact, FINALLY escorted to the exact suite Jacob had described to me days prior to my arrival—which in fact, had been available all along. I am not sure where, why or how this wasn’t known before our arrival, or why we were made to wait in the lobby for several hours with no apology or explanation other than Roger Bright (The first time I actually ever spoke to this man! LOL) calling me to abruptly say that Jacob was not authorized to give me the upgrade to the room we were in—(this is NOT something a hotel guest should ever be told. This is an internal problem!) I never felt more unwelcome in a hotel! I couldn't believe this was how the Kahala treated its arriving guests these days....it broke my heart. The experience we had in their beachside restaurant (The only one we could get in to, Plumeria) was mediocre at best. They kept giving us the Japanese menu--which we couldn't read--we are not Japanese and do not appear to be--not sure why they did this. The oysters we ordered were rancid-and needed to be sent back--twice. We wanted to try the other restaurants on property, but it's very difficult to get a reservations last minute, so make sure to plan ahead--something I don't always do on vacation. The Italian place looked great--I remember when it was a sushi place and it was awesome--can't say whether it's good or not--couldn't get a resi....The pool area is small for such a big hotel--and eating lunch past 2:00 is very limited. You're better off going off property because the menu offered at the beach has minimal choices--especially if you want to eat healthy. The beach set up is also challenging. I never found anyone to help set up a beach chair or bring a clean towel. It's pretty much self service--NOT what you would expect at a fine hotel or resort. I can't remember the last time I had to search for someone at the Four Seasons....or any good hotel for that matter.The Kahala is under new ownership--and changed hands the week of my stay--I don't know if this impacted my experience or not, but they have a lot of work to do to get it back to world class standards--I believe the management there is the same as it was before the change took place so it should have been seamless--but it didn't feel like it. It appears that the management and staff at this hotel just doesn't seem to have that ""can do"" attitude of other fine resorts. (Except the housekeepers and the spa staff...they were all very nice) Otherwise, no matter what was asked--from the front desk to room service to the beach to the management, it was if it was a bother to them! What ever happened to being hospitable in the hospitality industry? There are many hotel options when you visit Oahu--while the Kahala was once my favorite--away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki, but given the aesthetic downturn of the property, rooms and service, at these prices--I am inclined to go someplace else that focuses on the guest experience first--to spend my vacation time at a property that works hard maintaining and cultivating the customer service relationship and appreciates that we all have choices when we travel so they not only WANT to earn your business-but keep it. I wont be recommending this hotel to anyone.",stillwater,"Mamamorton202</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>stillwater</strong>",22,1.0

I was also very happy with the promotions that they had available whilst booking this holiday. The dolphin quest was amazing with leaving my children speechless, they were very friendly creatures up close and personal. They were very well trained with there professional trainers. The one thing that i would change about this resort would be the activities that were offered as there weren't as many and weren't advertised whilst we were there.

The biggest negative is the pool area, but if you are staying at a not-crowded time of year it won't be a problem..very small pool and very small jacuzzi..the beach is lovely but don't expect to go body surfing, there was no surf whatsoever.

There isn't a chair, sofa or square foot of carpet in sight that is free from stains. The beach side restaurant, which we were told at our 2PM check-in would be a great place for lunch, closes at 2PM. Your only option for food after that time is the pool cafe who's menu is on par with a Howard Johnson's - the chicken on my lame attempt at a salad was basically rubber and I think had drawn on grill marks. The fine dining restaurant is closed on Monday nights...I'm sorry, you run a ""high end"" resort and your main restaurant CLOSES one night a week?!?! Unacceptable. They have the nerve to charge $700+ a night for rooms and then make you pay an additional $65 a day for a beach chair with a built in shade that are all extremely shabby (nothing chic about it) and smell of mildew. We only agreed to pay because the tiny pool where chairs with shade are free is full of screaming children and random people roaming around after watching the poor dolphins they keep in a tank perform a show (I didn't realize we had decided to vacation at Sea World). We checked in a mere 2 hours ago and this is the experience we've already had. I'd pack up and move but we're only in town for two nights and it's just too much hassle.

Our room was huge and well-appointed and overlooked a golf course with a slight sea view to one side. The hotel is suitably grand and while the grounds aren't huge they are generally nicely kept.However, our stay was marred by a few downsides.To begin with, we were told on arrival that the hotel had a policy of deducting $100 a day towards guests' additional costs. Since we'd prepaid our 10-day stay in full and given them a credit card imprint, we saw no reason for them to demand a further $1,000 as security the minute we walked through the door. Reluctantly, they agreed to reduce it to $100 when we complained. A second issue is that while the grounds are nice they are not big. The golf course that runs around two sides of the hotel is out of bounds, leaving just the beach at the back and a small area in front of the hotel to wander about in. The private beach was nice, but not very big. A small oval swimming pool and patio area sits between the hotel and the beach. The constant weddings taking place in the Kalaha Hotel (often more than one at once) mean the public areas like the beach and lobby are frequently full of people you feel obliged to avoid, so as not to inadvertently appear in their pictures - effectively making these too out of bounds. Another issue was that despite the high charges the hotel makes, it does not provide some 'basics' in the price, like shade on the beach. If you want a cabana (sunbeds with a 'hood' on them) to protect you from the sun, for instance, rather than unprotected sunbeds, they want a minimum of $40 (for 4 hrs) for it. Parasols around the pool are, at least, free. Breakfast is also unincluded in the cost of staying there, and if you want a cooked breakfast will set you back around $35 a head.The restaurants in the Kalaha are all overpriced, in fact, and are not all open all of the time - the Seaside Grill, for instance, which is situated between the pool and the beach, closes at 5.30pm, ruling out any chance of you admiring the sunset (around 6.30pm) over a cocktail or light supper on the beach. Another, the Plumeria, is inexplicably closed two days a week. Fortunately, a 20 minute walk (or free shuttle bus ride) away is the Kahala Mall, where you'll find a good selection of eateries and shops. We particularly recommend the restaurant Chillis, which serves good cocktails, excellent steaks and salads and some great Mexican dishes; and the Whole Foods Market supermarket which in addition to some excellent bakery products serves hot breakfasts and dinners. The mall also has a good selection of other shops and eating places.The high costs of the Kahala Hotel extend to the hotel's spa, which charges about three to four times what you'll pay in Honolulu for treatments.We also didn't care for the fact that hotel keeps six captive dolphins for the purposes of entertaining its guests and raising money by selling dolphin 'experiences' to them. The area they are kept in is pleasant enough, but did not seem very big. One of the handlers told us one of its dolphins had been born there 22 years ago and could not be returned to the wild as it would not know how to survive. Nice. Given all this, we wouldn't visit the Kahala again.","London, United Kingdom","dragonbreath2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",14,3.0

Check in was easy and prepared prior to our arrival so there was no waiting for a roomAnd our room, oh my, what is not to love about our room. Decorated very beautifully in subtle yellows, blues and tans with wood features. The bed was extremely comfortable as were the pillows. Down I think? It was like sleeping on a cloud.The his and her bathroom was not only large but well laid out and nicely stocked with toiletries that were replaced constantly. Even though the pool and beach area are amazing it was nice to be able to relax in the soaking tub.Housekeeping was impeccable. She spent as much time as was needed each day to make sure the room was clean and tidy when we came back. Not that we make a mess of our rooms, but it was nice see that corners were not cut just to ""get it done"". And the nightly turn down was a treat, fresh slippers, chocolates, water and ice. She spoiled us!The staff at the pool/beach area went out of their way to make sure time spent there was comfortable. It didn't matter if you wanted a lounge chair set up under a tree at the very far end of the property, just tell them where and they set it up for you, and if you didn't feel like moving from your perfect spot they were more than happy to bring back refreshments.The Lagoon with the various aquatic creatures (and waterfall) is delightful. I went out daily at various times just to visit with what felt like ""my"" animal friends. They all are very well cared for. Their pools are cleaned often (I watched as this was being done) and the trainers were able to answer any questions regarding the sea life and their care.We didn't get a chance to eat at any other restaurants on the property other than The Plumeria. But the breakfast buffet was outstanding, so many choices of food items, all tasty and well prepared. Dinner was extremely good. I had the Rosemary Chicken, he had the Steak. Both cooked to perfection and gracious proportions. After a day of driving all around the island to see what Oahu had to offer...I was glad I made the choice to stay at The Kahala and can't wait to go back.I'd give The Kahala a perfect 10 if it were allowed.","Yucca Valley, California","debbie92284</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yucca Valley, California</strong>",37,5.0

Their staff is outstanding, most especiall U'i Medieros (?sp) who works in the front office.

Something so simple, and yet so elusive in the Ritz-Carltons, Four Seasons, etc of the world. She made an indelible impression with us. Also, when she found out it was our anniversary (30th), she sent us a special treat to our room. She is a lovely woman, and I regret that I was unable to thank her personally. Having said that, the only downside to the hotel is that there is no adult only pool, so if you are interested in lounging quietly poolside without screaming children (and there were A LOT) or getting splashed, your only somewhat refuge is to lay beachside, which is of course, not bad, but sometimes you would like to sun yourself without sand.","Los Angeles, California","Fortuna I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",109,4.0

We were even greeted with a stuffed animal upon check-in, which was a wonderful touch to begin our vacation!We also loved the turn down service each night and chocolates & bottles of water were greatly appreciated! The valet parking is the same price as self parking and is well worth the few dollars in tips each time we used our car. The location of the hotel is also a bonus. Being away from the chaos that is Waikiki was fantastic, but we were only 10-15 minutes away if we wanted to explore restaurants & shopping in Waikiki. The hotel room was very clean and mostly updated. I noticed a slight wear/tear in the bathroom, but the size totally made up for it. I'm very conscious about the cleanliness of hotel rooms and I wasn't disappointed with the Kahala!I would say having a rental car is a major plus, but isn't totally necessary if you don't prefer to drive. There is a shuttle service to Waikiki and we used it once during one of our days....It was a great service on a day we didn't feel like driving in.

I felt really pampered and taken care off. Everyone, from the bell desk, to the valet guys, the front desk or house keeping, were friendly and courteous - they always had a smile on their face! It felt amazing to always be greeted with a warm ""aloha,"" no matter where I went. Everyone seemed to genuinely enjoy working there! The concierge desk attendant gave us great tips in regards to where to go for snorkeling and avoid tourists, as I prefer a more quiet time.In addition, I absolutely loved the Dolphin Quest! I got to spend an hour with the trainer and the dolphins and these memories will stay with me for the rest of my life. As a matter of fact, they convinced me that I should return and maybe retire one day in Hawaii.Talking to the other hotel guests was also great! Turns out, the Kahala has a bunch of returning customers. Once you've stayed there, you don't want to stay anywhere else. Having their own, private beach that is not crowded, made a huge difference in my relaxation! For example, I ventured to Waikiki, just to see what is happening over there, and absolutely hated it!I came to the Kahala for my birthday and decided that i will make it a habit to spend all my future birthdays there as well.

For most of my visit I was accommodated in beachfront Waikiki properties, but as my stay grew to an end, I felt I deserved a few days of relaxation at one of Hawaii’s best resorts. I had previously stayed at The Kahala over 25 years ago. It was like being on an outer island resort, but literally ten minutes cab ride from Waikiki, so I booked three nights at The Kahala Resort to end our Hawaii stay.On arrival my wife and I did a quick walk around the property and were enticed by The Seaside Grill, situated literally on the private beach where we enjoyed a casual lunch under the palm trees before going back to our room to unpack.The foyer area with its huge chandeliers and high ceilings, takes one back to the elegance of yesteryear. The hotel’s décor throughout the property is tropical casual and just sitting and enjoying one’s surroundings is a pleasure. The hotel offers several dining options. We particularly enjoyed having high tea on the Verandah deck one afternoon. Each morning we ate our buffet breakfast from the huge selection of items available (including great crepes) in the Plumeria Beach House. The made to order egg white omelette and the Eggs Benedict were a favourite.All the usual amenities one would expect in a five star hotel are on hand. The Japanese Toto toilets with built in bidets and many gadgets, were most welcome.Rooms range in price from around $440 to $12,000 for the 2 bedroom Imperial Suite. Our room had the highest beds we have ever seen, almost needed a ladder to climb into bed, but very comfortable.The Dolphin pool/lake area, is home to 5 bottle nosed dolphins; one can pay a fee to swim with the dolphins, under the strict supervision of a marine biologist. Feeding the dolphins is also a popular option. This has enabled the resort to donate millions of dollars to help dolphins and other marine life. Although we did not take these options, we had an enjoyable time watching others participate. The dolphins appeared to be having as much fun as the guests. The number of interactions with the dolphins is carefully monitored.Every inch of the spacious grounds adds to ones enjoyment and relaxation. Overall, although it had been many years since I had been to this very elegant property, I was still impressed. Service, room quality and overall ambience was still very much five star.When only the very best will do.","Sydney, Australia","johnpond</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",86,5.0

There are just too many positive things too say about the resort and the experience. The room, grounds, service, amenities, food and staff were great. We chose to keep our island activities to about 1/2 the day, then the rest of the day we would relax by the pool and the beach. A wise choice since there is we ultimately wanted to relax on our vacation and the Kahala helped us achieve this. The Kahala is about a 20 minute drive to Waikiki but perfectly secluded from the tourist madness as other reviewers have noted. We rented a car and the valet/self parking was not an issue.The room we booked was the partial ocean view lanai on a higher floor with a main view of the golf course but the balcony goes out far enough where you can see the ocean to the east (good enough for us).As for specific tips and comments, we did notice the pool was mostly families and children. Not an issue for us since we were one of them, but I wondered how couples on a romantic getaway or singles felt about this. Perhaps an adults only area would address this? We tried to book the shuttle to Waikiki because our daughter wanted to ride on a ""bus"" but it was often full. Because we had a rental car this wasn't an issue so if you are on the fence about getting a rental car I would get one. Having a car was also helpful when needing to run to the nearby Whole Foods and the mall for basic supplies etc...When it came time to check out we did not want to leave and mentioned to each other we will most likely try and make this an annual trip.

Bathrooms we're beyond gorgeous and very thoughtfully done. Beds we're extraordinarily comfortable. The beach was beyond perfect. I would ditch the intertube as it's easy to lose control of it as the current gets strong.

I had an issue and it was easily resolved. The specialists are incredibly nice but be sure that you're satisfied. Ask for Spring!We got our food from Whole Foods. Not ideal but it was close and convenient. Lastly, they do pay more attention to Japanese guests but we enjoyed the grounds so much that it didn't bother us. We waited for a while for our room (they told us the valet was getting our luggage) but noticed three Japanese families checking in after us got quicker attention hence into their rooms faster. We asked if we can have our key without waiting for the bellman or valet. Never once were we greeted when we walked into the lobby or offered water, like they did to others.As I mentioned, the grounds and rooms were so immaculate that we really didn't care if we were greeted.

The hotel is very kid-friendly as it was able to provide a nice/big crib, kids' amenities, and even a baby bjorn potty seat. The service and food was also top-notch during our stay. The only problem we had was with the mattress--it was way too soft for our back. We asked for a firmer mattress during our 2nd stay a few days later and our request was timely served.

I'll break down the review into sections:1. Checkin: Very prompt and fast. No issues with requested rooms. 2. Rooms: There are different types of rooms, as the hotel will describe to you. I stayed in two different rooms, and one was not the ocean view side but I think that both sides are equally gorgeous and tranquil and great. The hotel is quite old, but the rooms themselves are clean, updated and most importantly, CLEAN!!! It doesn't smell or look old and everything is tastefully done.3. The Grounds: The location of Kahala Resort is perfect because it has a secluded beach that is sort of a crescent so that the waves are not strong and the beach itself is not crowded. The hotel covers a large area and within the property is a ""dolphin lagoon"" where they keep dolphins. This is the only downside to this hotel. I am sure people will be excited to see these dolphins but the fact that this lagoon is so small and dolphins are known to swim hundreds of miles each day with their pod, and the lagoon is basically a pool is unfortunate. I know that Kahala is ""partnered"" with the dolphin program and the resort themselves do not run this so I would expect their response to be that they will "" pass this information to the organizers"", but that's really not my point. Those dolphins are trapped much like the way we would feel if we only have our ensuite to live in for the entirety of our life and I am sorry to see that such a gorgeous resort supports this, regardless of how well they are ""treated"" and fed and etc.4. The Staff: Everyone is very helpful, from checkin to concierge and beach staff. 5. Proximity to Waikiki: Although this hotel is separated from the ""centre"" of Waikiki, it is only a 10 minute drive to the centre and the resorts location in respect to beach and quietness cannot be beat . It is worth the drive each day/night you want to go into town, and you are much better off staying at this location rather than fighting the crowd in Waikiki. The atmosphere is much more tranquil. Taking a cab would be approximately $30/ one way. 6. Food: I'm sorry but I didn't eat at the hotel so I cannot make any comments, but the breakfast buffet is always busy and the spread looks great. They have morning coffees setup in the lower lobby and also by the breakfast buffet section that is complimentary each morning and that was excellent coffee! They do have several restaurants on site.I hope you all enjoy your stay at Kahala; it is a wonderful resort.","Vancouver, Canada","Caesar_and_Chloe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",10,5.0

Positives: great beach and property, quiet away from the hectic Waikiki scene, rooms that are large and up to date, good breakfast buffet choices and the assistant front desk mgr Sahng who really went out of his way to accommodate us..Negatives: shuttle service to Waikiki (runs infrequently/needs a reservation), check in (when we booked, I requested connecting rooms since traveling with children and I called and confirmed that we had connecting rooms the day before arriving only to be told on arrival that it was not available), mixed experience with staff (Marc in Concierge was great but another concierge told us on arrival after an 11 hour trip with kids that there were no restaurants open at 4:30pm so sent us on a taxi ride to a mall yet later we learned that the pool restaurant was open until 5:15pm), long lines for breakfast buffet even though there were plenty of tables open, no airconditioning in some of the halls.Overall, you stay here for relaxation and the beach and that's 5 stars, but these other issues really detract from the experience.",New York,"travelwithkids_7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",173,4.0

There is a very large bathroom with wash basins up each end double hanging space and separate toilet and large shower. The rooms are very well kept and the best beds very comfy. It was fully booked on our arrival so had to wait up to 4 hours for our room as the first one we where offered was a long way from the main building but the second was on the 7th floor without a balcony as we couldn't upgrade, would prefer balcony as felt hemmed in not being able to open a window. the buffet breakfast was great, the best pineapple I have tasted.The pool area is getting very tired and not bigger enough. Not a lot of shade and lounges and umbrellas need replacing. The beach is greatvery clear and safe for swimming. The Dolphins are a great attraction to have on site. You can watch them all day and still see something different and the staff are great and will answer any questions who have. They run a free shuttle bus to the local mall, Waikiki and Al Mona through out the day and you can go in for dinner if you want to. The only downside is if you don't have a car you are isolated from eating at local restaurants. This hotel is very professionally run with very friendly staff.

We stayed in a dolphin lanai and that was magical we sat on the balcony a lot just enjoying the view. The rooms are tastefully decorated huge bathrooms. Staff where all friendly and welcoming. While the pool is not huge it does the job but the beach is a great substitute no waves and a perfect temperature my 4 year old loved it. I hired a cabana on the beach one day so could sit and watch her play with other kids. Food and beverage prices are reasonable so you don't feel like anything is overpriced because it is a luxury property.

The beach is private and away from the congestion of Waikiki central, the hotel maintains a dolphin pool, and is adjacent to one of the best golf courses on the island where President Clinton once played.

The Hotel Manager came up to my room to apologize. I was pleased with the attentiveness of the staff in regards to this problem.

I must say the service/employees go out of their way to make sure your stay is as pleasant as it can be. The location is great, away from the hustle of the big city, but central enough to visit any location on the island in a short time. The beach and pool are perfect. There are so many serene and peaceful places to hang out and enjoy this paradise on the property. The breakfast buffet is a great way to start the day. An amazing view accompanies each breakfast. We had dinner at Hoku's (I wrote a separate review) which was the best. The service there was better than many NYC restaurants and the food was just outstanding. Being called by our names at the restaurant was the perfect touch, and the manager will make sure you are taken care of. He was very personable. Little extras like the nightly turndown service, chocolates, bottled water, and the overall friendliness of the staff makes you feel very special, no matter what part of the hotel you are staring in. I can go on, but don't believe any negative reviews. We did have an issue upon check in, but it was rectified beyond our dreams and we thank Flora for that. They will go out of their way to make sure your stay is beyond perfect. Just ask them or tell them and they will react in the right way. If there can be such a rating as 6 stars, I think The Kahala should be the first to get it! If you are visiting Oahu, do yourself a favor and go straight to The Kahala. You will not be disappointed.

It was my first stay at this hotel and hopefully not the last. The location is quiet and feels secluded however it is a quick taxi ride to downtown Honolulu or an easy walk to the nearby mall. The beach is beautiful and quiet. My room was an ocean view that also had a view of the dolphin pools and was worth the upgrade from the mountain view. I noticed the mountains seemed to have rain clouds every day which is exactly what I was trying to take a vacation from! The only problem was that I left my swimsuit at the hotel and admittedly it took me 4 months to realize this. I called the hotel and spoke with a gentleman hoping by some slim chance they might have my swimsuit in a lost and found. He told me the maids get to keep any items they turn into the lost and found if it they are not claimed within 1 month. He told me he would check anyway and call me back. I didn't hear back from him. Considering the cost of the room it would have been great customer service to call me to let me know I have forgotten a swimsuit. I would have been happy to pay to have it shipped to me. I'm not upset...it was my mistake.

If you want peace and quiet in smart surroundings away from the madness of Waikiki beach then this is it. The hotel has a shuttle bus that will take you to Waikiki several times a day and will collect you too. Taxis are about $40 if you wish to make your own way.Before I review the hotel, if you travel from the mainland (LAX) to Honolulu use Hawaiian Air as this will set the scene for this fabulous group of islands. Run by Hawaiians they really are so proud of their home land that you will really feel part of Hawaii before you arrive. We visited 4 islands and Hawaiian air were on time and excellent as an airline. I must also mention that if you hire cars in Hawaii, use Hertz and hire a Ford Mustang convertible, again our cars were ready and the service unbeatable. The weak link in our trip to Hawaii could easily have been the flights and cars but they just worked perfectly, I cannot rate either company more highly. Fell free to contact me if you need any more information.Back to The Kahala, an easy drive from the airport at Honolulu to the hotel. On arrival we had a great welcome from the valet staff who took the car and luggage away and we were adorned with the Hawaiian Lei Garlands - Heavy beads for blokes and a multi coloured flower Lei for the ladies. LOVELY! We were taken to the reception desk (you will find most properties in Hawaii are huge and it is useful to allow yourself to be directed by staff to the reception areas). Rick Rogers was our receptionist and he very professionally dealt with our check in accompanied by the reception Manager Pok Kung. We had a fabulous suite on the 8th floor. The lounge area was a large sitting room with a drinks bar and even a sink with running water - excellent! The room had an en suite shower and toilet area, TV and phones. There was a balcony facing the ocean and swimming pool area. Off the sitting room was the bedroom with a Juliet balcony, lovely matching furniture, a desk, TV and phones. Off the bedroom was a fantastic dressing room, his and hers or his and his or hers and hers to be politically correct. At each end of the dressing room was a wash basin and dressing room area. One end had a toilet with an automatic personal washing system, (if you have never used one of these you are in for a treat!) The other end had a shower. Quality toiletries and plenty of hanging space and drawers. In the middle of this area was a large bath tub. LOVELY!!The hotel has a main quality restaurant used for general meals and breakfast, there are other restaurants which we did not use. Breakfast was a massive buffet which catered for a very diverse group of people. There is a predominant amount of Japanese guests at this hotel, probably because of the proximity to Japan. Every day we saw at least one Japanese wedding taking place and on one day we saw 4!There is an excellent bar area off reception where they serve drinks all day and afternoon tea.Near to the swimming pool is a dolphin pool and every day they were taking people to swim with them - the children particularly loved it - it was great fun to watch them. There are also turtles and sting ray fish in another pool. Access to the beach is very easy, 10 steps from the pool and managed very well by the pool staff who offer chairs, towels and tables. There is an excellent pool bar serving food and drink all day.All the staff at this hotel are excellentThere is a shuttle bus which runs several times a day to Waikiki if you wish to visit the madness of the area. You must go to see Waikiki to see the extreme contrast of the areas.Kahala is great if you want a quieter smart time in Oahu, Waikiki will be for you if you want fast pace, huge hotels and what I see as Las Vegas by sea kind of holiday.","London, United Kingdom","HotelBloke</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",166,5.0

Some of the workers would ask if you would like your picture taken together without even being asked. The rooms are sophisticated and detailed, I loved the charm of the furniture. As you walk in hawaiian love music is on (we later purchased the cd), we had complimentary champagne sent up to our room that night too as well. We stayed on the mountain side and the view from there was great, could even see the ocean. The food was incredible, from the poolside bar to the breakfast buffet to the Italian restaurant, Arancino. In fact, Arancino was probably some of the best food we've ever had. They even gave us complimentary macaroons since it was our honeymoon. There is a dolphin pool there and although we didn't do the dolphin encounter (probably wish I would have), I loved being able to watch them - they seem to be well taken care of and they explained that they are atlantic bottlenosed dolphins used to being in that environment. The pool and hottub were nice, although we didn't spend much time there as the beach was beautiful. The water was warm and they had a nice floating deck that you could jump off of. They have beach side service and make the best lava pina coladas.

The location for us could not have be more perfect. Waikiki is a beautiful City, however for us we wanted a more relaxed and quiet atmosphere which is exactly what we found at the Kahala Resort. The resort itself does not look like much from the outside, however once you enter the outrageously beautiful lobby you can't help to feel as though you are among royalty. The entire staff could not had been more welcoming and eager to please. In fact, after previously living in New Jersey and being poisoned by bad attitudes for 10 years, I couldn't help but to wonder why the check in desk attendant was so happy and smiling so broadly upon arrival. It did not take long to figure out that this is friendly highly personal treatment that one can expect from every employee at this resort.We found the actual room and bathroom to be comfortable and spacious enough for our needs. The bathroom had 2 separate sinks and vanities (opposite sides of the room which was nice), along with our own closets. You will also find a nice soaking tub, separate tiled shower along with the toilet room. We did struggle a bit with our room selection at the time of reservation as we were not sure if we wanted to spend the extra money on partial ocean view, lanai, ocean front, etc as there were many room options to choose from. We ended up going with the partial ocean view (with diamond head views) and we did select the lanai. Once at the resort I re-visited the pricing structure and decided for the cost different of a partial ocean view versus ocean front was not worth the extra expense as we did not plan to spend much time in the actual room. The partial ocean view however is extremely partial, therefore if you want a decent ocean view, and don't mind spending the extra money, I would strongly suggest booking an ocean front room. We did however really enjoy and was glad we chose a room with a lanai as we used it as an additional sitting area when we were back in the room. We had a great time and would definitely return to this resort should our travels take us back to Oahu!

This is truly a beautiful hotel with its own secluded.beach, a dolphin cove, well manicured lawns and a pool that felt like it was heated. Everything is absolutely first rate including their restaurants. The biggest seller in my opinion is the calmness of the resort as opposed to the hectic pace down by Waikiki beach. After spending an afternoon down there you just cannot wait to get back to The Kahala to unwind. No hustle or bustle; no tension just the pampering and relaxation you look for. This is the place to stay on the island.","Paramus, New Jersey","ssuds3121054</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paramus, New Jersey</strong>",43,5.0

I cant think of anything bad about it. Perhaps the smallish pool is the one thing that is lacking. Its just a simple oval. Yes its a fact - its expensive. Dont stay here if you are going to be counting every penny because this is not a place for budget travelers. There is an automatic tip added to everything. You need to understand that Honolulu is probably the favorite destination for Japanese tourists. There are many many many at this hotel and all over Honolulu. In Japan it is not customary to tip. Therefore, If part of your income is based on tips, and most of your customers dont tip its completely understandable that it is added automatically. We found the hotel shuttle very handy and used it exclusively as we did not rent a car. Granted, you may end up waiting for it at stops in town - sometimes it might be late due to traffic. And if you dont have a reservation you may not be able to get back on whenever you want. Do reserve your spot! We were not touring the rest of the island and preferred the minor inconvenience to the hassle and cost of a rental car. Buffet breakfast was included in our rate and we had breakfast there everyday. We found the selection extensive- there is everything you could possibly desire. In addition to the buffet, there was a made-to-order omelet station. In addition to breakfast, we also ate at the Veranda and Arancino during our stay. We enjoyed both meals. Arancino is called an Italian restaurant but it was sort of Italian with a twist. Very modern and inventive. The Veranda was also nice. We werent inspired by anything on the dessert menu so we kind of came up with one of our own and they were happy to put it together for us. Beautiful setting. Do request a table on the Veranda rather than inside.We stayed in two different rooms. We had reserved a partial ocean view, but it was on a low floor so we mostly had a view of the porte cochere. The next day we moved to a higher floor facing the mountain, but it also had a view of the ocean if you stepped out on the balcony. Both rooms were exactly the same. The room was extremely comfortable- good bed and good sheets. I loved the bathroom-kind of separated into 2 parts each with a separate closet and sink. I really like a 2 sink thing. Lots of bathroom amenities which were replenished every day.The grounds were lovely. The hotel has its own private beach. It feels like you are very isolated but Waikiki is just a short ride away. It was so peaceful that we stayed on property alot. The pool as I mentioned is just a simple oval as you see in all the photos. My husband could have spent hours watching the dolphins. I disagree with the review that said the dolphins are confined to a coi pond. They actually have a large lagoon and if they are feeling antisocial parts of it an inaccessible to guests. I think they like the people though because most of the time they are over there with all the people. They have trainers and handlers on site all the time and these dolphins are not in any way mistreated. The big lobby area is much more impressive in person than in the photos. Its really beautiful. Very high ceiling with interesting chandelier and sort of ""island"" decor.We had a his/her pedicure in the spa. If you can get your husband to do this with you I recommend it. I had to twist his arm a bit but he enjoyed it.The area where the Kahala is located is in a very ritzy area. You pass lots of mansions on the drive into the hotel. There were several that were quite run down which we felt was really strange, but found out that a billionaire named Kawamoto had bought all these mansions and neglected or tore them apart and just left them. When we were there they had recently been sold to a real estate company. If you see any run-down properties on Kahala Avenue they were probably his. This doesnt have anything to do with the hotel, I just found it interesting.We had a most enjoyable stay and I wouldnt hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is not on a tight budget. I would love to stay here again.",San Francisco,"DavieWavie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",41,5.0

Everything in the room screams plush and no matter which room you're in it feels as though you get to see the best of Honolulu whether it is the beach or a look at the mountains. The grounds are easy to walk through and navigate but still maintains a feeling as though you are away from the crazy tourist environment that is Waikiki. The beach is semi-private and the hotel offers many amenities for the beach area itself. The grounds also has a dolphin lagoon and small sea creature lagoon also for those who are traveling with families. Downsides would be the high price- but with this place you get what you pay for. The restaurants on site do charge an arm and a leg but friends who have been here rave about the unique cuisine they have here. I would definitely come again!

I stayed there once before, for one night about thirteen or fourteen years ago, but I was so busy on that trip (and it was such a brief one) that I honestly don’t remember very much about the experience, except that I had absolutely no complaints. It’s almost as if this was my first stay at the hotel.I cannot say enough great things about The Kahala. I have been familiar with the resort my entire life, as it’s where my parents spent their honeymoon in May, 1970. It was The Kahala Hilton back then.It was such a pleasure to vacation at The Kahala this month. I stayed in room 724 in the Diamond Head wing, and I could not have been happier with the accommodations. I noticed that some TripAdvisor reviewers have complained about the beds. I had a great night’s sleep every night, so no problem there, and those individuals will be pleased to know that the mattresses have been replaced! The one in my room was replaced (swiftly and discreetly) on my second-last day, so I had the pleasure of trying it out for only one night. Honestly, I didn’t notice a difference (same good night’s sleep), but hopefully those who are sensitive to such things will be pleased. Also, it’s nice to know that the hotel continues to invest in upgrades.A good description for The Kahala is “quiet, understated luxury”. Consider some of the fantasyland resorts on Maui. Yes, they’re impressive to look at, what with the huge open spaces, dramatic architecture, and fountains and waterfalls everywhere, but quite often less is more. While there’s nothing wrong with those places, they’re usually very large (sometimes too large for their own good), and they’re most often situated right alongside one another. One of the special things about The Kahala is that no matter where on the property you happen to be, you don’t see huge neighbouring resorts. In fact, you don’t see resorts of any kind - just beach, mountains, golf courses, and quiet residential neighbourhoods. This means a lot especially when it comes to the view from one’s room. The location really is ideal. I’ve read some reviews that claim the hotel is isolated. One reviewer stated that “there’s nothing else within walking distance”. First of all, people should determine what is or is not in close proximity to the hotel *before* they leave home. Do your research! Also, it is not isolated. It is located in a beautiful residential area, and the hotel provides complimentary shuttle service to the nearby local shopping center (The Kahala Mall), to Waikiki, and to the enormous Ala Moana Shopping Center. Even if, for the sake of argument, we’re going to say that the property is isolated, well - that’s a huge part of the appeal for me, and probably most guests. Complaining about how little is within walking distance is like staying in the center of Waikiki and complaining that it’s not quiet and tranquil enough. The staff is fantastic. Several individuals stand out. Brian (or Bryan?) who escorted me up to my room with my bags when I arrived. Shayne (or Shane?) at the Seaside Grill, who went out of his way to sort out a great table for me when the place was essentially full. Heidi, who did a wonderful job of looking after my room every day. It was a pleasure to see her in the corridor each morning. Those three deserve special recognition, but all of the staff were superb. Also, Wakako Sasaki, Sherrilyn Uganiza, and Ellen Maki of the Reservations and Guest Services departments were extremely helpful when I dealt with them by e-mail prior to my arrival.I didn’t dine at Hoku’s or Arancino, and unfortunately I had to cancel my reservation for Afternoon Tea at The Veranda, but I was always pleased with my meals at the Seaside Grill and Plumeria Beach House. I enjoyed some delicious meals from Room Service, too.The Kahala is the perfect place to visit on Oahu. You truly do have the best of both worlds: tranquility and serenity at your home base, with the island’s many attractions and plentiful dining and shopping options just minutes away.A very big MAHALO to Carmine Iommazzo, Ryan Fitzgerald, and the entire team at The Kahala.

Huuge Bed Huuge room. Really cool AC. We couldn't leave! we had to extend our stay...another two days! The food at the Plumeria Beach House was superb, perfect for a wedding!

So thankful for her!  needed advil and some hygienic supplies at 1 o clock in the morning, and the sundries store had closed at 7 o clock. They sent down a security guard and a clerk to take care of our transaction! What service! Many famous people and people of great influence have stayed at the Kahala (Princess Diana, the Clintons, Steve Martin) and i can see why. Its amazing. I felt that i was being treated as they would have been treated.AND House keeping was amazing! They would even fold our clothes that we left out!

The location for us could not have be more perfect. Waikiki is a beautiful City, however for us we wanted a more relaxed and quiet atmosphere which is exactly what we found at the Kahala Resort. The resort itself does not look like much from the outside, however once you enter the outrageously beautiful lobby you can't help to feel as though you are among royalty. The entire staff could not had been more welcoming and eager to please. In fact, after previously living in New Jersey and being poisoned by bad attitudes for 10 years, I couldn't help but to wonder why the check in desk attendant was so happy and smiling so broadly upon arrival. It did not take long to figure out that this is friendly highly personal treatment that one can expect from every employee at this resort. We found the actual room and bathroom to be comfortable and spacious enough for our needs. The bathroom had 2 separate sinks and vanities (opposite sides of the room which was nice), along with our own closets. You will also find a nice soaking tub, separate tiled shower along with the toilet room. We did struggle a bit with our room selection at the time of reservation as we were not sure if we wanted to spend the extra money on partial ocean view, lanai, ocean front, etc as there were many room options to choose from. We ended up going with the partial ocean view (with diamond head views) and we did select the lanai. Once at the resort I re-visited the pricing structure and decided for the cost different of a partial ocean view versus ocean front was not worth the extra expense as we did not plan to spend much time in the actual room. The partial ocean view however is extremely partial, therefore if you want a decent ocean view, and don't mind spending the extra money, I would strongly suggest booking an ocean front room. We did however really enjoy and was glad we chose a room with a lanai as we used it as an additional sitting area when we were back in the room. We had a great time and would definitely return to this resort should our travels take us back to Oahu!","Naples, Florida","Michele D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naples, Florida</strong>",32,5.0

We stayed at the Kahala 10 years ago, and a lot had changed since we were last there. The hotel is beautiful and the staff are all very nice and attentive. I particularly loved the various fruity waters that were served every day in the lobby.We had two rooms: one facing the ocean and one facing the mountains. Both were incredibly spacious. My room (mountain facing) had two large beds and a huge bathroom with two sinks which was very nice! The beds were comfortable, and we got two waters and two delicious chocolates every night before bed.Our package came with complimentary breakfast every morning. The buffet at Plumeria was one of the best buffets I have ever had! They had essentially any food you could think of! The waiters were all very nice, too.The beach was beautiful and usually quiet. However, because all beaches in Hawaii are public, there were a few days when VERY noisy teenagers came and disturbed the peace at the beach. It was very distracting, but I understand that the hotel could do little about it.The poolside bar and grille was certainly convenient, but, of course, overpriced. I had a delicious peach and mango smoothie once and a Caesar salad, but that was it. Service was good and it was great to be served on the beach. The only other hotel restaurant we tried was Plumeria Beach House for dinner, and that was good too.I used the fitness room nearly every day during our stay. It was wonderfully located to face the ocean, and I was usually one of two or three people there. It had all the equipment one would need, the only annoying thing was that the wifi didn't work there (I'm not sure why). The wifi usually worked in other parts of the hotel, but it was frustrating to have to keep reconnecting every time we wanted to use the wifi.Overall, the Kahala is a great, great, great hotel!

This place gave the last Ritz Carlton I was at a run for their money.Rooms are spacious and even the view of the mountains is lovely. The reason you stay here isn't for the room though, it's to let them take care of you. How you ask? Well stroll on down to the pool or better yet the beach and they don't just hand you towels. They set up your chairs or cabana for you, placing their special lounge chair fitted towel down, handing you additional towels and then asking if you need anything else....I bet a server might swim to the little floating dock in the ocean to bring you a drink if you asked.That was the theme for the day and a half we were there. Whatever we needed, a staff member is only too happy to oblige.Couple tips for people that haven't been here: a) you probably know but check out the dolphins on prem b) the gym is super nice and they offer TRX classes on this little structure out in front facing the ocean (additional cost but would be awesome) c) if you are staying to hang out after check out, you can use their complimentary concierge room to shower up (it's the same place as the business center and it's staffed d) while you have a coffee maker in your room, they serve coffee/tea free of charge in the mornings on the ground floor e) if you can get breakfast included in your room, it's worth it.","Yorba Linda, California","robinl887</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorba Linda, California</strong>",29,5.0

The live music in the lounge is fabulous and only adds to your enjoyment of the beautiful grounds. The Dolphin Lagoon (not where we stayed) is fabulous is you have children or like the idea of watching the dolphins swim by your room. We chose a beautiful partial ocean view with a lanai and loved it. While you don't see the ocean from your room, you can sit on the balcony and catch a glimpse. The view was stunning so don't let that put you off if you ""always"" have an ocean view. We liked being on the 6th floor, it was quiet and the view of the lush golf course below was spectacular. We wouldn't change a thing, and will be back again very soon.","Los Angeles, California","welovetravelsf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",30,5.0

The Kahala's food venues are wonderful (usually there will be as many local residents as visitors enjoying the tasty fare). The rooms are spacious, airy, and beautifully appointed.

At this point, we have lost count of how many times we have been - close to 10. And I will definitely be back again.Room:We booked the Ocean Front Suite on an advance booking deal. We had stayed in this room category before and had forgotten just how panoramic the views are. They are spectacular. We were on the 8th floor and spent many hours on our balcony enjoying the view.Food:We tried the new Italian restaurant (Arrancino?) and found it to be good but perhaps not great. We also enjoyed the food at the Veranda (the Ahi Musubi and Short Ribs are a must try!). Far and away, our favorite is the breakfast buffet. You must try the thin pancakes, the Kahalasadas (by the omelet station) and the sticky buns!Given that this is my fourth review of the hotel, I won't re-hash but will say that we still love the hotel. Close to the action of Waikiki if you want it, but also quiet. The perfect combination.I did notice that they have changed their suite packages a bit in terms of what was included. Just make sure you know what is and is not included (the partial ocean view suites used to come with complimentary cabana use and evening cocktails/pupus, but now does not appear to).The only small negatives I can point to are two: first, hubby found the bed to be too firm. Second, the wifi was extremely frustrating. It would work, but you had to re-click the terms of service agreement far too often.We will definitely be back and highly recommend it.","Orange County, California","SarahInSoCal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",166,5.0

That's a once-in-a-lifetime experience (unless you happen to be William and Kate, who had been there several weeks prior). So, our ""room"" is so far out of the ordinary that the only purpose to include it in this review is to share some photos.More realistically, and thinking of the entire hotel for we common folk: it is a jewel in an upper class neighborhood (think Beverly Hills Hotel with a beach), so there's no Waikiki hubbub. The staff is warm and professional. Shuttle busses can take you to nearby shopping or ""name"" restaurants in other parts of Honolulu if you choose to leave the property, so unless you plan to do some touring, you're actually better off not renting a car at the airport - and paying the extra airport fees and overnight fees at the hotel. You can rent a car at the hotel (cheaper and easier).There are three restaurants on property: the Plumeria Beach House (indoor/outdoor seating, breakfast buffet), Arancino (indoor/outdoor seating, three or four course menu (no a la carte), and Hoku (indoor, dinner). We found Koku to be our fave, and ate there twice; ask for Bob if he's working on your night there, and he and Tony will guide you the best locally caught items of the day. We found Arancino to be a little overpriced and, strangely, misplaced; it's right on the portiere, so if you are dining outside you may have shuttle busses belching natural gas fumes a few feet from your table (we asked them to turn off the engine, and they promptly did - but why set up a situation like that in the first place?).Bottom line: if you have been to Oahu before and don't need to drive around this time, you may just spend your entire vacation on the property.*Driver to and from the airport? Yep! The last time that I tried to find the car rental return at 6:00 am I ended up in the military base two times.

What a nice surprise this stay was! We moved from another hotel on waikiki because we were so disappointed. This hotel was a complete 180 from the others on ""the strip"". We were greeted with genuine smiles, beautiful bead leis and warm hospitality. Built back in 1964, this hotel has a beautiful old modernism to it that fits in with today's newer, sleeker designs. Inside it is filled with warm tropical decor, wooden accents, beautiful floral arrangements, cozy furniture and lots of natural sunlight. The staff was lovely from the housekeepers to the front desk to the pool servers. We loved our room. It was a standard with an upgraded lanai and view of the golf course. I typically would prefer an ocean view but was happy with the peaceful greens out our windows. The room was large and decorated in neutrals and light blues with a large bathroom - two vanities, soaking tub and shower. The robes were soft and the toiletries smelled awesome. The bed was the worst part - saggy and worn with no firmness. We were going to dine at the Plumeria house for their seafood buffet. Upon inspection, we were underwhelmed by the set up and selection and felt it was just a few notches up from a Hometown Buffet. We decided to eat at Hoku's instead which is their fine dining restaurant. The entree prices average around $55. With this being said, we expected a very high level of service and attentiveness. Instead we had typical ""island time"" service meaning dirty plates stayed on the table too long and water glasses went empty. We ordered the small seafood tower and a salad which was perfect for two people. It was good but not great and we felt overcharged for a very expensive dinner that offered a so-so experience. On the other hand, the food and drinks and service at the pool grill was great. We enjoyed the edamame, cheeseburger and complimentary watermelon. Without a doubt, I'd recommend the Kahala. I was afraid we might feel too distant from the action of waikiki but it was a nice escape from the crowded streets and touristy hotels. I loved the feel of this property - very Klassy and Klean!!

Turndown service was very nice with slippers laid out, water by our bed, and chocolates on our bed. The only area that we found inconsistent was the bell staff. We had our own car and frequently left the hotel for various reasons. The staff, especially early in the morning, were at times, rude. One time, we asked for our car and when we went to get it we were handed the keys and pointed in the direction of our car! What happened to the 5-star service of bringing up the car and holding the doors open for the ladies? Another time we asked for some water (which they usually provide when leaving) and were told they didn't have any, ""they didn't receive their delivery""!

There were a few more healthy options to choose from, which is appreciated. The staff was very attentive - we received a ""good morning"" or an ""aloha"" from nearly every staff member that we encountered, even in passing. It was my parents 45th anniversary (primary reason for the trip), and I had called ahead to let the hotel know. They had champagne waiting, wished them happy anniversary, welcome back, etc. Between my parents and I, we ordered room service several times, and it was excellent food and received in a reasonable amount of time. My dad got bitten or stung by something, and when my mom called to ask the front desk if they had some Benedryl or Cortaid, there was a security/EMT guy at the door practically as soon as she hung up the phone ready with remedy. If you pay the ""rack rate"" here, yes it is expensive. However, they offer packages regularly, most of which include a breakfast for two, 4th night free, etc., which brings down the cost. The breakfast buffet is wonderful and so extensive, it pretty much eliminated the need for lunch for me, anyhow. We never encountered any issues with sitting right down to eat. We ate at Hoku's the last night, and the service and food were both excellent. The only time we were a bit flummoxed as to what to do for food was Sunday night, when the Plumeria is a buffet dinner.

The entire staff—from the bell desk, to the check-in desk, housekeeping—works to ensure guests have a pleasant stay. They staff during my stay was unfailingly helpful and informative. The facility itself is as beautiful as the setting. Rooms are generously sized with refined décor. The bathrooms are well lit with plenty of towels. Everything is spotless and in good repair. The breakfast buffets are excellent and a good value. Lunches and dinners at the hotel restaurants are excellent, if expensive—but not out of line for a hotel in Hawaii. About half the rooms come with balconies and about half face the ocean (full or partial views). I was in room 219 and all the rooms on that side and in that wing of the hotel have an ocean view, but the ocean is partially obscured by the parking garage and the entry driveway. If you like to sleep with the windows open to enjoy the breeze, the noise around the front of the hotel makes that difficult. However, with the windows closed, almost no noise is heard. The website provides a useful schematic of the hotel room features and prices. Two charges to be aware of are that overnight parking is $28/night and that the hotel adds $3/night housekeeping gratuity to the bill. These charges are listed on the website, but are easy to miss. On the hotel grounds, Dolphin Quest runs a number of different programs for hotel guests and others to interact with the 6 dolphins in the hotel’s lagoons. It’s a once in a lifetime experience worth every penny. The keepers/trainers are enthusiastic about their careers with marine life and clearly love sharing what they know and love about the dolphins.","Jefferson Manor, Virginia","mackovita</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jefferson Manor, Virginia</strong>",89,5.0

This IS my favorite place to stay on Oahu as you get a quiet peaceful vacation but you can still experience the insanity of Waikiki in only 10 minutes away.We spent 6 nights here over Valentines Day/Presidents Day weekend with our 17 year old son to check out University of Hawaii Manoa and Hawaii Pacific University as he had been accepted to both. We booked golf/mountain view rooms with no balcony as were were not planning on spending too much time in our rooms this trip. The rooms here are really beginning to show their age and could use a renovation in the near future. Our room #816 had the added plus of being a corner room with an added window over the bed with views of the ocean and koko head. You could also see Diamond head. The tradeoff is a smaller bathroom with only 1 vanity and 1 small closet and combo tub/shower. I have stayed in this room before and unfortunately it still has loud plumbing noises 24/7 as well as the old doorwall window which rattles in the wind. The mattress on our bed was so old we each fell into holes on our respective sides. I have never complained about a mattress before, but we did go down 2 the front desk after 2 nights and ask them to please change the mattress. We came up from the pool 4 hours later and the room had been made but it still was the old mattress. My husband found the maid on our floor and asked for a new mattress. She agree a new mattress was needed, made a call and one was delivered within 5 minutes. Our son was down the hall in 804 and while his view lacked diamond head, koko head and the ocean, he did have the larger Kahala bathroom with 2 closets, 2 vanities and seperate bath and shower. He said his room was very quiet. Breakfast was included in our room each morning. The buffet was good and was constantly being restocked. The wait was about 10 minutes to be seated each morning.Unfortunately it rained 90% of our stay. Unusual for this time of year. We only got 1 day plus an hour our last morning out on the beach. There was a large convention of insurance agents there (1st time we have ever experienced a convention here) and they took up a good portion of the beach. We were shocked to see them bringing 12 packs of beer out onto the beach. In the past all Hawaiian beaches have been alcohol free zones. If you wanted alcohol, you had to go to the bar to get it and then drink it discreetly. Hotel servers would only serve you alcohol on the grass. The pool attendants happily set us up with lounges further down the beach. The hotel servers served both food and alcohol on the beach this trip and said nothing about the outside alcohol which was a surprise. Service the last morning was awful. We stood in line over 20 minutes just to get towels as many people were having staff set up chairs and blow up beach toys. We elected to get our own beach chairs so others could be served quicker. There was only 2 staff in the hut, definitely not enough as everyone wanted to be outside that morning after all the rain.We had 1 lunch and 2 dinners at Plumeria Beach House restaurant including the Valentines night buffet (I usually HATE buffets, but this one as great!). The food was excellent, servers excellent and full of the aloha spirit. This is where this hotel excels. We had 1 dinner at the verandah. We wish there would have been a bit more on the menu, but the food and drinks were again excellent. We had dinner at Hoku's and as always the food was exceptional. Our son was congratulated for his acceptance to both universities upon being seated by both the hostess and our server. Our only complaint was that we had ordered a very nice bottle of vintage french wine. Large wineglasses were brought to the table and we were told the manager had to go downstairs to get it from the cellar. Our entrees arrived and still no wine. About half way through the entree we were told they couldn't find the wine and needed to reselect. Since we were almost done we just had another cocktail. A bummer, but we saved 600!The hotel has a new Italian restaurant out in the front by the valet that used to be a nice Japanese restaurant. Unfortunately it requires you to order an expensive pre fixe multi course menu unless you go after 9:30pm and then there is a very limited menu. We chose to skip it and instead drove into Waikiki for a great steak and bottle of wine at the venerable Hy's steakhouse which is always great and a must do.Will we be back. Most definitely yes as we love the location and staff. We were surprised that our son liked The Royal Hawaiian where we stayed in Feb 2013 because the Kahala was sold out better. Our other sons who did not come this trip have always liked The Kahala better. The rooms are large, we just would like to see them gutted and completely redone.","Los Angeles, CA","RPV5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",94,4.0

Two small negatives but they are so easy to correct that it's a pity that the management doesn't takes care of it. Wifi it's dreadful (difficult to connect, always asking for the password, bad speeds and a number of other problems that i prefer to forget).... And as many other revisors of trip advisor keep saying - Pool staff is really needing a strong review - it's not only the fact that they only work if you tip them generously... it's their attitude, rudeness, unavailability to help and also the bad quality of beach material (the beach towels are worst that any 2 star hotel)......",Lisbon,"alwaysmovinglisbon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lisbon</strong>",49,4.0

First impressions on arrival were that this was truly a special property. The lobby, entrance and public areas were tasteful and suitably impressive without being over the top. Our check in was smooth and efficient and we were told just enough about the hotel to keep us going without overloading us with details. The room we took was large, overlooked the golf course and mountain and was extremely clean and well presented. Although there was no balcony, there was a huge sliding glass window that could be opened completely that gave the room a bright and airy feel. The bathroom was well appointed with everything you would expect of this standard of hotel. The bed and linens were as comfortable as we have ever experienced. Free WiFi was easy to set up and available throughout the hotel including the pool and outside areas. As this hotel is a little far away from Waikiki, there are limited options for dining within walking distance. To this end the hotel overcomes this obstacle by providing 4 or 5 dining options which range from reasonable to expensive - there is also a shuttle bus that departs regularly for Waikiki and the shopping centres which we used a few times during our stay. Everything we ate at the resort was delicious as were the wines which had clearly been well selected and were priced well. The daily breakfast buffet was well catered although for the price some alternative options for coffee such as latte or cappuccino would have been nice. Service was exemplary throughout the stay with the only negative being on the last night at Veranda when the drinks took over 30 minutes to arrive and actually came after the food was served. The only other negative was probably that the pool was small and got very crowded with kids. The dolphins were great to watch and never particularly crowded. The hotel benefits from being just a walk away from Diamond Head but if you don't want to walk, hiring a car is all taken care of on site and is very simple. All in all a thoroughly enjoyable experience.","Setagaya, Japan","TokyoSG</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Setagaya, Japan</strong>",19,5.0

The room was gorgeous and the bathroom was beautiful. We sat at the beach for a while and my husband took out a kayak. The view from the water, looking back at the island, was amazing. We had room service dinner out on our lanai. Completely relaxing and enjoyable. We didn’t eat at Plumeria for dinner because it was buffet style.

A lot of people like to stay on the Waikiki strip, but to us, its just too commercial and looks more like a regular city than a beach destination.The beach is nice and ample; tho the waters are a bit shallow around the resort (which I guess is fine if you are with kids). The pool is definitely small and thats where Kahala loses out: but its a small issue given the luscious ocean waters around you.The rooms are large and comfortable and if you can: go for the Ocean View Lagai room; it overlooks the dolphin area and you have wonderful views of the ocean. The sun is ample and if you are feeling lazy; then you can sun yourself on the balcony (why would you do that, tho, is a different question!)The staff is just amazing: I've been to multiple hotels and resorts in the US and I think, at times, resort staff forget their hospitality; but you won't have this problem at all at Kahala. We enjoyed our stay at Kahala so much, that we cancelled our intended travel to Miami and ended p spending 2 more nights at Kahala.Dining options is one place for improvement. They have limited choice and while the buffet spread etc (for breakfast) is good; the restaurants, otherwise, need to explore much more with what further options they can provide.

BUT, we also wanted to be outside of the city yet, on this side of the island for part of our vacation. We were greeted with such a nice welcome from the staff. In our room was a incredible birthday desert and a nice card from the hotel manager welcoming us. The room is clean, spacious and has a beautiful view. Honestly what I love about this place is the energy and feeling when you are here. It is not pretentious. We had some great conversations with guests that have been coming here for years and the reason they return is because they feel comfortable and welcome. While some reviews may say the drinks are expensive or it is outdated...none true in our eyes. The drink pricing and our dinner (which was fantastic) was quite similar to the other resort we stayed at on the west side. Considering the resort is 50 years old, it has been updated and maintain with great care. The history of it is interesting and the views are amazing! Granted we are celebrating a special occasion and typically may choose a more modestly priced resort...but this is worth every penny. It has that more intimate feeling that large hotels can't offer. I thought I better write the review before I get home and move on with life and forget.

The staff goes out of their way to welcome you and remember your names and that really allows you to relax when the kids are doing their own thing.

It is such an amazing little touch and you can tell it is the philosophy of the staff from the top on down. They can't do enough for you, and it is NOT done for the tips. The staff at the bell desk runs to help you and you never feel like it is because their hands are out. The servers at the bountiful buffet run like crazy to get you whatever little extra you want though I am sure most people don't tip buffet breakfast servers well. Randy at Plumeria gave us remarkably good service each day and made sure my kids had hot and fresh Plum donuts every day. You are treated like a VIP, though regardless of what I feel like when I am there, I am not. The walls are covered with VIP's who have stayed there, from President's to Queens, to sports and movie stars. I have to believe it is the service they receive that brings them back. There are many beautiful resorts and when you stay at the Kahala you understand why those VIP's come.The beach at the Kahala is a private one that is very calm. It is very beautiful and they have many activities you can do there. My kids snorkeled and paddle surfed off the calm beach and we were able to take an outrigger canoe out and see Whales that were literally right off shore. For us that was another area that shined. Pete who oversees all of the beach activities, aside from being just a really nice guy is so great with the guests. He helps them surf, always has interesting info and is just a really nice fixture to have on the beach.If you are looking at the Kahala please think of all these things. You can see for yourself how beautiful it is. These things you will only see when you stay here. Any negative complaints here are just from people who either like to complain, or ones who like to nitpick over inconsequential things. Hawaii is expensive, it just is. However if you stay at the Kahala and your big complaint on trip advisor is that the drinks are very expensive than aside from doing your fellow travelers a disservice, you really should see the big picture. This is a top notch, first class resort and you feel special every second you are there.","Long Island, NY","arosen15</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, NY</strong>",60,5.0

The dolphin pools the water falls the beach the restaurants, all were just mind blowing. The room overlooking the dolphin pool was so great. Every morning walking out onto our lanai and watching them play was so much fun. The room was five star all the way,just beautiful. The staff at the beach were on top of there game. You can rent whatever you need to play in the water. Just rent a cabana and soak in the sun. We stayed four days and ate breakfast at the plumeria room everyday, and it was really special everyday.

I am a very picky person and there is not one negative I can come up with about the Kahala. Every element of our stay was perfect. We had a dolphin lagoon lanai room, and we loved it. We could see the dolphins swimming and playing from our room. Upon arrival and entering our room the kids had little dolphin stuffed animals waiting for them on their beds that said Kahala on them. It made them feel so special and welcomed. The turn down service was great. The whole family enjoyed our Dolphin Quest experience while staying at the resort. We dined at Hoku's on Valentine's Day and the service and food were outstanding. My husband and I ordered a 5 course meal with wine pairing. Our waiter brought a special little something for our children with every course. It was so thoughtful. The great thing about this resort is it is top notch without being stuffy. It is a relaxed, beautiful, and friendly environment. The beach was beautiful, clean, and the water was nice and calm. All of the restaurants were great. We rented a car from Hertz, which has a office located in the resort. It was easy and convenient. I recommend the Kahala to anyone who is looking for a relaxed, luxurious resort.

It is one of our favorite places for a relaxing vacation, and it is nice enough that we have never wanted or needed to try another hotel on Oahu. The ocean view rooms are the nicest, and you should know that the partial ocean view rooms don't really have much of an ocean view but they are otherwise just as nice. The service is top notch. Many of the staff have worked at the hotel for a long time, and there are faces we recognize from prior trips. All of the staff are gracious, helpful, and patient. We have occasionally seen demanding guests, but never a grumpy staff member.When many people think of Oahu they think of Waikiki, but that is not what draws us to the island. We are there for a quiet break away from the crowds so we like the location in the Kahala neighborhood near Diamond Head. The Kahala Hotel is right on the beach and their pool is very kid friendly. You can buy or rent just about any pool toy your kid will need or want (the snorkel set was a hit this time). The same goes for the equipment at the beach (both kids tried the stand-up paddle board in the calm waters off the beach). You can have lunch either in your cabana on the beach (there is a rental fee for the cabana) or at a table near the pool. The food comes quickly and the menu is just right for the casual setting. Some people may not like the fact that it is not an all-inclusive resort and that you pay extra for things like the cabana, the pool toys, the paddleboards, and boats. But they are clear about what costs extra, and I am happy to pay for what I use. For the days we spent away from the hotel, we rented a car at the Hertz counter at the hotel for a day at a time. They have a limited number of cars, so we have learned to book ahead, but it is one of the few places where you can get a single day car rental without having to leave the property to fetch the car. This time we ventured out to see the Bishop Museum and did some kayaking in Kailua Bay. In the past, we have gone to the Polynesian Cultural Center, but skipped it this time since we can recite most of their jokes by memory now.The food at the hotel is great. The breakfast buffet has something for everyone. It includes the American breakfast basics (eggs, potatoes, sausage, pastries), healthier options (yogurt, salmon, fruit, oatmeal, tropical juices), and even some Asian breakfast items. Dinners at the Veranda, Hoku's (seafood theme), and Plumeria were all fine - well prepared and nicely presented. The fish dishes were especially good at all of the restaurants and at poolside. We did not try the new Italian restaurant; we get enough Italian food at home.The Kahala is a popular location for weddings, and while we were there this time there was also a corporate event going on. We have never found these other activities to affect our enjoyment. The hotel is big enough that it would be a destination for group events like these, but there are many far larger hotels in Hawaii where I would imagine that such activities would be even more prevalent.Overall, I would say that the service, the setting, and the convenience are what bring us back to the Kahala again and again. It is a family favorite.","Seattle, Washington","rcseattle2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",5,5.0

I don't want my criticism to take anything away from the these very important assets of the Kahala. But honestly, we were disappointed. The hotel is 50 years old and it shows. The common areas/lobby are in need of a major overhaul, as is the pool. The pool is really pathetic for a resort. 4 1/2 feet deep? The stores in the hotel were lackluster, and that's being charitable. To call the little corner of one store the convenience store was joke. It's unbelievable that a resort that is really not within easy walking distance to a convenience store would not have better selection than that. Every other hotel in Hawaii that we've stayed at was FAR better in that regard. We were also treated as second-class citizens to the Auto-Owners, as they were given priority over us ""paying"" guests. Overall, my wife summed it up best for me. It wasn't really a resort we were staying at. Just a hotel.","Seattle, United States","Eric S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, United States</strong>",4,3.0

Breakfast was included with the room and had a large variety of tasty food. The hotel was full but we never had any trouble getting seated. Before we came, I was a bit worried the pool would be small and overcrowded but it wasn't. There were always open recliners adjacent to the pool and the pool was active but not crowded. The pool was heated. The beach was very nice and they groomed it each morning. It was easy to get a nice spot on the beach and there were many staff to help with whatever you needed there. The snorkeling was there was okay but there are better spots to go. Our kids went to the Dolphin Adventure and loved it.

Toilets made me want to throw up biggest germ harbour ever, they have the TOTO toilets when they were last sanitised I don't know. The carpet made your feet dirty underneath, and the chairs in the room were not the most comfy, and as I said before SMALL ROOM. Not worth the price.

On two occasions we couldn't get into the new italian resturant on resort as they said they were fully booked, but when we walked past they seemed empty. The afternoon tea is delightful. The other resturant is ok and again repetative. Breakfast room beautiful looking over the ocean.

Great hotel for children (ours our 6 and 1) and does not feel too crowded even when full. Positives- The beach - Cannot say enough good things about it. Beach is mostly self-contained, such that my older child could wander up and down it without us worrying about him straying too far off. Water is extremely calm and clear. There is very good snorkeling on the reef about 50 feet out. My 1 year old could walk in 20-30 feet on the gradual slope down. Plenty of water sports rentals available (though no sailing), but the staff who run the outsourced rental program were awesome - very attentive, patient and supportive, especially with the children- Breakfast buffet - Plenty of options and we never got bored- Location - if you want something a bit more secluded, this is it. No other hotels within 10-15 minutes of here, but that means it is about 10-15 minutes to get to Waikiki and the various hotels and shopping, if you want that. We spend most of the time on the beach and loved that it was not overrun.Negatives - Wifi is terrible. Signal strength is weak and it kept cutting out. Not a major issue given that we are on vacation and trying to get away from the constant electronic interruptions- The restaurant service is the only thing that really drags down the rating, if at all. Most of the restaurants appear to be slightly understaffed or staffed by people that move a bit slow at times. Ordering food at the beachside cafe can take a long time. Strangely, room service and ordering directly from your beach chair seem to be much quicker or predictable (or perhaps you do not notice the wait as you are engaged in other activities instead of waiting at a table)- Some water sport rentals are a bit pricey. After paddle boarding for several days, I think it would have been cheaper to buy our own equipment and just leave it there. But the quality of the surf instructors more than made up for itWould we go back?- Yes, we have been going for several years and likely will go back again next year.

You can still get a lounger on the beach or by the pool, you can head to the poolside restaurant when you're hungry and get a table easily and the staff seem genuinely happy and not stressed.

Well maybe you need to be an 'A lister' to get the level of service some have experienced. We aren't, and we didn't.Problems (some may seem niggly, but remember $900 a night.....):Check-in was basic. No cold towels or drinks offered.Room directory has no list of services as in most hotels, just phone numbers.Room has a drip coffee machine and three filter packs plus three tea bags of different types, plus creamer. We requested fresh milk and were told that it was available at a charge through room service. We requested more tea bags and these arrived, no problem. Next day back to the basic three.......No complimentary cookiesNothing in the mini bar.One pair of slippersNo cutlery at all, just a wooden stirrer a la StarbucksTurndown service arrived for two nights, then nothing. We followed up on this and it took hours for Reception to communicate with Housekeeping who arrived at 9.00pm.We stood around at the entrance to the Poolside Bar waiting to be shown to a table. Serving staff carefully avoided our eyes for some time, then someone volunteered that it was free seating (not indicated anywhere). Had a similar issue when I sat at a table the next day and waited to be served for 15 minutes - plenty of staff around, but I felt invisible. Once served, we were asked every few minutes if our drinks were OK, but when we tried to get the account everyone avoided our eyes again.At the breakfast buffet we were charged $6 extra for espresso coffee.There are charges for all pool/beach equipment except towels. The hotel website has an expansive description of all the complimentary services available to the occupants of a suite, including beach equipment, but it isn't clear what a 'suite' consists of (some hotels use this term for rooms) or that nothing is available for others - one reason why a room directory with this sort of information would be useful.We arrived on 1 Jan and asked the Concierge what dining options were available for that night. He told us that all restaurants were 'fully committed' without any hint of regret or any suggestions of alternatives. This hotel is remote from Waikiki and in an upscale residential area with no other restaurants or cafes within a mile. It would've been helpful if the hotel had communicated the need to make a restaurant booking in advance of our arrival. In fact this is the only hotel I can remember that didn't make any communication at all before we arrived - it is standard in my experience for all better hotels to email an advance welcome and offer to assist with any arrangements.The shuttle service is too infrequent and is often fully booked.Not one staff member remembered our name in the five days we stayed there - not an issue for me, but other reviews have mentioned the opposite experience. In fact it wasn't until the last two days that a new breakfast server remembered our coffee order (and we breakfasted at the same time each day - very early).With the exception of one or two star performers - such as that breakfast server - the staff did not seem overly friendly or overly efficient, just going through the motions. Again, this is not acceptable at a hotel of this grade.Good things:The room was excellent - well furnished, good bed and bed linens and I liked the large bathroom/dressing room arrangement. Bath plus seperate shower stall, two sinks.The dolphins - fabulousWe booked a Dolphin Lanai room and I contacted the hotel in advance to request a room with the best view of the dolphins in that category. We absolutely got that, which was much appreciated. the interraction with the dolphins was endlessly entertaining, and the rooms weren't noisy as there are no dolphin 'shows' as such, just small groups with trainers and dolphins.I requested a late checkout, for payment, and a very pleasant reception clerk organised this for a $50 per hour supplement until 6.00pm. (It seems that they also charge for early check-in which I haven't seen at other hotels).In summary, my overall view is that the hotel falls short of the standard of their Westin, Trump, Sheraton etc peer group in delivering consistent quality of service and should really look again at some of their penny-pinching policies.","Melbourne, Australia","maxie88</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",77,2.0

The property is a heritage style building and the foyer had a beautiful Christmas tree which made the hotel very festive. Reception staff were very welcoming and upgraded our rooms on arrival. Our rooms were at the back of the hotel overlooking the golf course and even though they were on the smoking floor, we were pleased with our rooms which were spacious with a nice balcony. The furniture and decorations are perhaps a little tired and old fashioned.The cafe restaurant where breakfast is served was so-so. My parents arrived in the morning and as their rooms were not ready, they joined us for breakfast and were immediately told they had to pay, as breakfast was not included on their first day! Even though breakfast is expensive, they still charged extra for cappuccino/latte which was really annoying and unnecessary in a hotel of this calibre. In fact, the whole 'push for tips' every time you ordered food or drink was hard to swallow, especially given they already charge a minimum 18% for groups of 6 or more. Housekeeping told me she had her day off on the day of our departure but her colleague would be happy to pass on my tip!! On the day of our departure, the 'new' housekeeper kept asking when we were checking out. When the luggage was being collected, she darted into the room as soon as she saw I had left an envelope.Three incidents are worthy of mention. The first involves the reserving of pool chairs. On our first day I sat on a chair at the pool. I was there for over 3 hours when I was approached by another guest advising me that the chair was 'hers' and I needed to move!! She told me she had been coming to the Kahala for over 20 years and pool staff always reserved her chair even when she wasn't at the pool!! She then went over to complain to the pool staff. I was dumbfounded by her audacity and also went to question the pool staff on this ridiculous policy. I was told it is not in fact hotel policy to allow guests to reserve chairs and the Manager did come to apologize, however it didn't escape my attention that this woman continued to have the same chair reserved throughout our entire stay!! The second comment is in reference to the hotels dolphin programme. Undoubtedly a wonderful touch for hotel guests and we paid handsomely ($700 plus tax) for our daughter to be a 'dolphin trainer for the day' (5 hours) as her combined birthday and Xmas gift. It should have been a 'once in a lifetime' experience but the trainers were so busy accommodating other guests who had paid for dolphin photo and swim experiences, our daughter had to fit in and join those other groups. She was given very limited 'one on one' attention and left feeling disappointed. Over the five hours ( or to be exact 4.5 hours, as they finished early) they didn't even offer her a drink or snack. 98% of the professional photos taken as part of her package included other families and the photos themselves were poor quality. On our final day when we were checking out, the hotel had a stand in the lobby with snacks/coffee where kids were icing Christmas cookies etc. We automatically assumed it was a Christmas activity the hotel was putting on for the kids as there was no signage or staff to indicate otherwise. My daughter, Mum and I joined in. To my horror, we were later handed a bill for $125. When I complained, I was told it was a paid event.... Very poorly executed and embarrassing. It was also our last impression. We won't be returning.","Sydney, Australia","spoonos65</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",96,3.0

The Kahala is a really beautiful and peaceful resort and did not disappoint in these aspects. It has a lovely old world appeal which I really liked. Our room was beautiful and comfortable, a little worn in some areas with scuffing and wear but not too bad. The staff is fantastic and extremely helpful. Not much in the way of supplies in the room especially tea bags. I hate to sound picky but I expected these things to be in much more plentiful supply and variety for such an exclusive resort. I guess the idea is to order room service but it is nice to be able to make a cuppa in your room when you feel like it. It was lovely to wake up on Christmas morning and open our door to find a gift from the Kahala, that was a really wonderful touch! Just a couple of small things, we thought it was a bit much to have to pay for cabanas and beach chairs to use on the beach. As hotel guests, we assumed these things would have been supplied and to have to pay extra was a surprise. Our in room dining menu was missing/removed from the folder and it was difficult to convince staff that it was missing and we were not imagining it. We eventually received a photocopied version brought to our room. Just one more thing, I realise when I booked this resort that The Kahala has captive dolphins in the lagoon. I'm not sure in this day and age if this is still appropriate, it just seems cruel. They are obviously well cared for physically but they are intelligent creatures and I wonder about their mental well being. I am no expert by any means and I know they are used also to educate visitors and are a big draw card to the resort but, I just don't know if it is right, this is just my opinion.","Sydney, Australia","Amanda C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",6,5.0

When we arrived, we had to wait some time to be escorted to our room. After 15 minutes I went back to reception and asked what the delay was. We were not offered water or a drink on arrival. When I asked for water I was directed to a water urn on a desk. Seriously! We were then taken to our room by the receptionist I'd complained about the wait, to find the concierge with the luggage already in the room. We stayed in an ""ocean view"" room which had a large view of the car park with some ocean view. When I mentioned this I was basically told ""this is what you booked"". Perhaps they should be a little more honest with the ""view"" component. The room was okay but the furniture scuffed and scratched. The bathroom was positively claustrophobic with no air circulation. The mattresses were lumpy and uneven - extremely uncomfortable. Not at all what we expected for a property with such a high reputation.

Sometimes I could only afford ice tea but every staff member made me feel that I was as just as important as one of the many heads of state or Hollywood elite that were frequent guests there. When my parents visited Oahu or when my aunt sent me birthday money we went to the Kahala to dine in the Maile room or have drinks on the beach. Fast forward through the years.In my many subsequent visits to Hawaii, and there have been hundreds, the Kahala was always in my itinerary. And it never disappointed. The same grace, beauty, and excellence in service. Just a few weeks ago I made a short two night visit to Oahu and checked in to an ocean front room. I'd forgotten how large they are, how well appointed, how quiet. The carpet seemed 10 inches thicker than before. The lobby was spectacular, decked out for the Christmas holidays. The classic lines of the property's architecture are even more stunning today. The guest mix was what you'd expect. Well heeled, sophisticated, international, but nice. No pretentiousness. The staff anticipated and accommodated every request. Quickly, thoughtfully, gracefully. Smiles everywhere. If there is heaven on earth, I'm sure the Kahala is part of it.",san dieg0,"Jeff L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>san dieg0</strong>",27,5.0

Free pickup/drop to HNL Airport. I had a rental because we wanted to travel, but they reached out to offer a SUV pick up so I know it was available.2. Welcome amenity (chilled mint towels at check-in, stuffed dolphin toys for the kids, fresh fruit and chocolate macadamia nuts in the room as we walked in)3. Evening appetizer and cocktail in suite -- this is awesome, just tell them what cocktails or kids drinks you want in the afternoon and they are delivered to your suite along with a changing appetizer every day (mini pasta salad on day 1, ratatouille day 2 . . .etc)4. Daily breakfast at Plumeria Beach house (2-bedroom suites -- we got four breakfast per suite included in the package). We are early birds and got there at 6:30am when in opens -- gets busy starting at 7:30am, so be ready if you are late breakfast kind of person. The selection is great -- recommend the fresh papaya from the Big Island and the Kalasadas (doughnut).5. Newspaper and morning coffee/tea delivery to suite -- love this. Got it delivered at 6am, served in a thermal carafe to keep in warm along with the local newspaper.6. Complimentary beach cabana -- these are really loungers on the beach with pull up covers to block the sun. You get a 2-chair lounger per suite. Best part is they give you flag poll -- raise the flag and the staff comes over to take your drink/food order.

While it is a great spot just out of Waikiki and provides a sense of tranquility and seclusion. The best parts for me were the beach and the grand entrance.Apart from that, the staff seemed detached with a hint of attitude. Right from the point of driving up for check-in. Since all we could get for a rental car at the time was a minivan, we were greeted with some shock when we advised we were staying and not just ""dining"" as they suggested when we drove up.At near $US900 / night our room was comfortable but a tad too traditional, with some attention to detail lacking. The beds were also too soft and lumpy, with amenities such as body wash, soaps etc etc were limited compared to other hotels of this ilk. Even water, was NOT included.The fitness centre was well equipped, but the locker rooms/steam and sauna didn't look as though they had been revitalised since the 60's when this hotel was built.We did not eat at the signature restaurant, instead favouring Arancino, which is located within the resort, but is a separate entity.So if you like things a little olde worlde (but dont expect the quality standard to be associated with it), with a sense of celebrity and exclusivity (yes there were celebs there when I was staying)... go for it.

Mahalo, Kahala, for the welcoming touch of a chilled bottle of champagne waiting in our room! Thank you, Herin for the room with a balcony, a wonderful way to dine on our first night!This year, my impression is that service and attention to details seem to have gone up another notch. It started several weeks ago with an email from the Concierge offering assistance. Lauren was most helpful in arranging our dining reservations at the resort. Every employee we met upon arrival starting with Herin at the front desk has been gracious, friendly and helpful. It was wonderful to have some of the employees, such as Julie at Plumeria Restaurant, welcome us back. Service is comparable to that at the Fairmont and the Four Seasons in Maui. The beautiful beach without huge waves (not for surfers) made swimming a dream, which makes up for the aging pool - one area that could use improvement.Tips: best to book package that includes breakfast, complimentary coffee at 5:30 AM, don't drive to Wakiki Beach, use complimentary shuttle and be sure to reserve.In the past we have usually come in November, but this year our stay coincide with the Honolulu Marathon in early December. The road that lead to the Resort was closed for most of the day during the race. I was impressed with the Resort’s efforts to ensure that guests were able to leave the Resort during the Marathon. I was provided transportation to the point where the road is closed, escorted in crossing the road where the runners were passing through and then put in another vehicle for the short ride to the Kahala Mall. Thank you, Heidi, for seeing to it that I got back to the Resort, and for your big smile!Kahala Resort is for those who wants to enjoy gracious experiences in Hawaii. It is tranquil and yet only a 10 minutes drive to stress yourself out with the crowds on Waikiki Beach.

The resort is beautiful has that quiet elegance and is away from the hustle /bustle of Honolulu. We were there Thanksgiving week and while the resort was busy it was not overcrowded. At the check in we were offered a suite upgrade at a discounted price and decided to accept it after being told about what was offered.....however a short time later we were advised the suite was not available after all....we were disappointed and no alternatives were offered....but our room and the view was beautiful. We had an oceanfront w/lanai. The lanai's were larger than other hotels which was nice. Room was lovely with Tommy Bahama products which were really nice. We had the breakfast buffet as part of our package and Plumeria House was beautiful with outside seating. The buffet itself was good but it was not a large or varied as other hotels...we stayed at the Fairmont in Maui last week and that buffet was great. The same items were offered each day and no real variety or changes daily. Also we had Thanksgiving dinner at Hoku's and while it was good, we had Thanksgiving dinner here as well in 2006 and it was much better with choices and much more food. This time for turkey you were given one piece of white meat turkey with some sides. Again the food was good but it was definitely lacking when compared to our prior meal. The focus seems to be more on presentation and trying to make it ""fancy"" rather than a traditional meal. I will give kudos to the chef for working with me on an allergy problem I had with the appetizer. We absolutely loved the beach! Did not use the pool as we prefer the beach and the pool was small and overrun with children. It was confusing the first day as there was an attendant on the beach and when he was done setting up one couple we stood there right where the couple waited and he walked right by us, not asking if we needed help or even hello. I finally figured it out and had to go to the hut by the pool and was told there was a $25 fee for renting an umbrella! Wow that was a first - but since they do not charge a resort fee, they have to get you somewhere. But the beach was beautiful and water calm. Gym was ok - but small - I think there were 4 elliptical and 4 or 5 treadmills....but they had what was needed. They should offer bottled water rather than paper cups you get in a dentist office for water. We had no problem with the shuttle service - as other posters noted they had problems. I inquired about it and was told you can make a reservation on the shuttle up to 24 hrs in advance....we did and no issues....unfortunately we did not know what time we were going to come back so we took a cab - $22 - rather expensive given traffic was at a minimum.

Just about everything exceeded our expectations. Our room was a spacious mountain-view room, with tub, shower, and “his and hers” sinks and closets…and immaculate! Some of the niceties on our arrival included cookies with ‘Aloha’ written on the top one, a stuffed dolphin on the bed for my daughter, and a cd of Hawaiian music playing as we walked in to our room.What really made this hotel exceptional, though, was the staff. Everyone we encountered was friendly, knowledgeable and polite. The concierges, maids, and all of the staff made us feel welcome and made our stay as enjoyable as possible. Our maid and some of the restaurant staff called us by name. When one of the waitresses heard that we were disappointed that there was no more acai sorbet at the breakfast buffet, she brought us 4 fresh ones just a few minutes later. The concierge was so nice to take many pictures of our family in front of their beautiful Christmas decorations. The pool service catered to our special request of a real coconut with straw and spoons. I could go on.The pool was great for both children. My daughter, who is 4 feet tall and gets cold easily, loved that she could stand in parts of it and it was heated. The dolphins, turtle and sting rays were all fun to watch in between swims. While the pool is a little small, we were always able to get two lounge chairs together. The Plumeria breakfast buffet was exceptional, with the usual buffet breakfast choices as well as Japanese fare, cold coconut tapioca soup, acai sorbet, made to order omelets, fresh papaya, coconut syrup for waffles, among others. There is inside and outside seating, and the sunrises there are just beautiful. Although the hotel is in a secluded area where one needs a car or taxi, it was not too far from shopping or some Oahu attractions. In addition to it being close to Waikiki, The Kahala Mall is approximately 2 miles away. It has a Whole Foods grocery store and a pharmacy, so we could easily buy some snacks and drinks to fill our non-stocked refrigerator. We also found some less expensive restaurants there. Diamond Head is just a couple of miles down Kahala Avenue, and Hanauma Bay is about 15 minutes away. We rented snorkeling equipment from the hotel to use at Hanauma Bay, and it was good quality.I took a sunset paddleboard yoga class through their fitness center that was just amazing. It was just me and the instructor, Daniel. Having never been on a paddleboard, I was a little nervous about falling off, but never did. The yoga instruction was perfect for an evening workout, and the sunset was beautiful.We enjoyed the beach, too. We rented a paddleboard a couple of times; no lesson was necessary. We enjoyed the calmness of the bay and swimming out to their anchored dock.Our family would definitely recommend this hotel to others, and we hope to come back one day.

You see, this place frustrates me to no end because it has such amazing potential…and it just doesn’t quite meet it.

This is cool but not necessary – I wish they put this much effort into making the experience better.There is a dolphin lagoon – Cool for the kids but seems rather cruel in many ways.CONCLUSION:I really like the Kahala.

While on vacation having access to good quality food and beverage onsite is clearly a draw for us and many of the other repeat guests. I only wish the Japanese restaurant did not leave.

The setting, just yards from the beach and with a view of Koko Crater, couldn't be more beautiful.The hotel is in a upscale neighborhood, walking distance to Kahala Mall. It is advisable to have a car when staying here or plan to hire a taxi or car service because this hotel is slightly off the beaten path, though only a few miles from Waikiki. The hotel has an in-house taxi drivers as well (I really enjoyed riding around Oahu with Doug, a driver who is also a survivor of the Pearl Harbor attack and who seems to love to share his knowledge about Hawaii with guests).The rooms were nicely decorated, however the were minus some of the niceties that might be found at other resort hotels (i.e. no TV embedded in the bathroom mirror or other such things here).The facilities of the hotel were wonderful although, again, the swimming pool wasn't nearly as fancy as some of the ""free form"" pools available at other resorts. However, the no frills pool is right next to the on-site dolphin and sea turtle ponds where, for a fee, you can swim with dolphins.

Highly professional and courteous staff. Incredible use of space in the rooms, not remotely cramped. Beautiful ocean and mountain views. Excellent restaurants. A beach/poolside bar that is wonderful. On site ponds with dolphins, turtles and tropical fish. Did I mention dolphins!? Tasteful and discreet management of celebrity guests. More Japanese weddings than one can count.This was the back end of a 50th birthday party -- we sent the others home after a week at Ko Olina, then sunk in at Kahala to lose ourselves to its charms. Close enough to Honolulu for social needs, far enough to be quiet and private. Perfect launching spot for a round the island drive. We entertained local friends and business associates at a few of the venues on site.There you have it. Kahala is a perfect tie with Hale Kulani, easily the most exclusives spots on Oahu.

The location is far from downtown and Waikiki Beach but the setting would have been great to avoid the hustle and bustle of those areas if that is what we were searching for. The hotel is quite a distance from the airport as well and its best to arrange car service from the airport if you wish to stay at this hotel.The grounds were really nice featuring a semi private beach, small pool and its own dolphin experience. I found that most of the people staying at the hotel were there for conventions or were families, so if your seeking a night life or a bustling beach this would not be a place for you.The hotel rooms I would rate a 7 out of 10. They have definitely tried to rejuvenate them but they have odd layouts and didn't really impress us. The staff was fairly friendly except for the reception on check in. We were booked for a room with two queen beds and ocean view but were told that even though thats what we booked that wasn't guaranteed. Really? It took two managers and a little strong arming in order to get them to mysteriously find us a room with two beds that the initial 2 people we spoke with didn't have. They gave us a golf course view room but didn't lower the price to reflect it either.All in all if you are a family trying to get away this may be a good option for you, just make sure you have it well documented on which room you will actually get when you arrive.","Newport Beach, California","CarteBlancWine</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport Beach, California</strong>",48,4.0

We stayed for 9 nights, being 2 adults and an 8 year old child. The setting on such a beautiful swimming beach is great with some coral reef to swim on and see some fish. Having the dolphins right outside our door was great and our daughter loved going to see the fish, sea turtles and sting rays. The room was awesome, being a great size and having a good layout and amenities with large bathroom as well. The beds were very comfortable.Things that we did not like were few. The pool is very small and I could imagine when the hotel is busier (was about 50% occupied when we were there) it would be a big problem, although having the beach should ease the strain. The kids club offered some good options - crabbing, net fishing and more - but it was too expensive and nobody else was willing to pay. There were plenty of kids at the hotel but we had to cancel our daughter's time at the kids club because she was the only one there. They should use the kids club as an attraction to attract families, making it free, rather than trying to suck more money out of guests (other hotels we stay at with free kids clubs are always better than paid ones). Not much else to complain about except perhaps the $28/day for parking - something they could possibly justify in Waikiki where parking is tight, but not so much a way outside the main centre. You did feel you were being sucked dry of money sometimes.We went into Waikiki and wandered around resorts there and the Kahala is miles ahead of those - crowded and dirty around the beaches with drunks lying around in some places.We would definitely recommend the Kahala and will stay there again when we return to Hawaii.",Pleasanton,"NeverInOnePlace</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pleasanton</strong>",52,4.0

The staff are extremely helpful and friendly everywhere you go on the resort. The resort property is unbelievably clean and there is tons to see and do, there are five dolphins that call the Kahala home, you can spend hours watching them play in the lagoon. You can lounge pool side or 100 ft away on the beach, both have food and beverage/ bar service. The beach is great, the cove in front of the beach allows for a safe swimming area for the kids, also morning yoga class in the water on a surf board……that was really cool. The resort has several restaurants, the food was fantastic, all but one have a great view of the ocean. The rooms are beautify appointed, the bathrooms have his and her closets and sinks, we made the mistake of cheeping out and not getting a balcony suite, that won't happen again. The breakfast that happens on the beach side patio every morning is spectacular, but pricy and is the only option we found on the resort, take my advice and book the breakfast package deal with your room. Saying that, a resort of this caliber does not come cheaply. If you are working on a limited budget or looking for a cheap getaway……this is not your place. The property is about a 15 minute drive to downtown Honolulu and Waikiki beach, this works well as it is an easy drive or short evening cab ride to head out and see the sites, or head east and go up island and enjoy the scenery. We did this trip as a couples trip however there were tons of families there as well. I am rating this resort experience as a five star, as it truly exceeded our expectations.

You get free drinks and snacks late afternoon (with the rate I purchased) and that was nice too.My only disappointment was the new italian restaurant.

If you want that type of ""tasting"" dining experience it was good, but not what I expected so I was a bit disappointed.

The experience from the greeting by the valet, the check in to the check out was superb. So many of the staff have been there for years (one I met over 40 years) I believe this is telling of how wonderful it is. A real test of staff to me is if you report something that you think is a problem and they take care of it right then and there and don't suggest that you speak to someone else or say they will report it, I had this happen twice here, I was impressed. The rooms are nicely decorated and comfortable (though I must say the mattresses in room 927 could use a flip!), the amenities are nice, the lighting and television well thought out. The best part of the hotel is it is away from Waikiki. You have to see it to understand. The breakfast buffet is great, and FYI if you want eggs other than an omelet, ask. We ate in Hoku's twice. The first night we had their 50th Anniversary dinner with a wine pairing. It was well presented and tasty. The wine pairing is a bargain. The second night we had a sushi/sashimi appetizer, I am wishing for that right now! We shared the lamb chop dinner, the lamb is encrusted in salt and roasted, they break it out of the salt shell at the table for you. We also had a tempura appetizer that I could have done without. My one comment is that the pool is small and there were a lot of children running around. It would be much nicer if there were two pools. There is a baby pool but the babies/children all seemed to be either in the big pool or the Jacuzzi. Otherwise, the pool is nice, chairs seemed to be plentiful and there is good service.

The only property that fits this bill on Oahu is the Kahala (the JW Marriott, Disney Aulani and Turtle Bay are all located far outside the City, while all the other hotels are located in Waikiki). To be sure, in its location, the Kahala was perfect. Situated in a quiet, upscale residential suburb, the Kahala offered us the tranquility we were looking for, with a great little beach, but only a 10-20 minute drive to all the major shopping, restaurants and historic sites of the city. The actual resort is small-ish and characterised by a subdued aesthetic. If you're looking for a grand, sprawling resort with huge pool features and amenities, then this is not the right place. I liked the low-key atmosphere, which I found relaxing and unpretentious and a far cry from the maddening crowds of the larger resorts on Waikiki.The rooms were large and as with most luxury hotels, came with a very comfortable bed with ultra-soft pillows and a pillow-top mattress. Amenities included free internet, free daily bottled water, Tommy Bahama bathroom amenities and evening turndown service. Decor was island-style but still felt up-to-date and not particularly dated. Service was satisfactory, though not quite up to the standard of other 5-star hotels in major cities. One day, the maid service just failed to come despite our having hung the ""Please Service"" hanger on our door knob from 8:30am. Some of the concierge's restaurant recommendations also did not turn out to be particularly good. Further, unlike at other 5-star resorts and hotels, we just didn't feel that the service staff made efforts to truly anticipate our needs. At other 5-star resorts, while at the pool or beach, attendants will often come to serve you cold water or pineapple slices or chilled towels, but this was not the case at the Kahala. Service was definitely friendly throughout, I just did not feel that it went the extra mile that I would expect from a 5-star hotel. We ate breakfast at the Plumeria House buffet every morning which had a limited selection. It was not impressive, but again was satisfactory for our purposes. We also dined at their fine dining restaurant Hoku's which was overpriced for what was offered. I would recommend going to Roy's down the highway in Hawaii Kai for better food at cheaper prices. All in all, I would not describe the Kahala as 5-star luxury, so much as 4.5 star high end. Everything was satisfactory and I would definitely come back again because of its location and relaxing atmosphere the next time I am in Honolulu, however I cannot say that it truly stands out among other comparable resorts.",South Pole,"Tanagan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Pole</strong>",109,4.0

The hotel is located about 10min away from the touristy bustle of Waikiki and allows the adult guest a somewhat relaxed atmosphere with a beautiful and placid beach ( unpatrolled so caution). Check in good with the usual upsell of better rooms for a fee when you arrived which was enticing.The rooms somewhat ageing as most of its Honolulu competitors ( beside the Trump) offer decent sized accomodation providing you take a upgrade to the Laguna fronted rooms where you will entered by the antics of the resident dolphins. This is one of the highlights of the resort that prides itself with its performing troop of dolphins which you can interact with for a hefty fee of course or $100-200. The food options are ok with breakfast being served in a roomy cafe while you line up like cattle to fill your plate with the usual American calorie rich breakfast intake. There two other restarts being an Italian and and a modern international fusion restaurant at five star prices. For convenience they pass, but there are better offerings in Honolulu centre. As a family of 4 ( two kids aged 4 and 6) the food was o.k but we started getting tired of tipping and taxes and our way to the Wailea shopping centre where wholefoods chain provided excellent healthy foods and also there were other USA franchised food places to keep the family happy.One major complaint was the poorly run kids club which was small, lacked diverse activities and was run by staff who were not very flexible or compassionate to the needs of young children. They required advanced booking of activities and were not very friendly in my opinion. The resort being a five star should move the kids club over to numerous vacant spaces on the lower ground floor and provide a real kids club with games, outdoor play areas ect Overall, the place passes but is ageing with a need to upgrade the infrastructure especially the on,y small pool which had us packed around like sardines.

First I noticed on the second day of our trip (after pre-paying for our stay) on Expedia that the hotel had re-charged my room rate. And it wasn't just a hold it was a $4,000 cleared charge that the hotel needed 5 days to reverse. They admitted to the mistake. As if to rub it in the hotel continued to hold amounts on my credit (impacting my available balance) of $9,000. The manager admitted the holds were excessive but had no explanation. He said ""it seems totally excessive"". I agreed given I had been charged twice for my rooms and spent only $2,000 while at the property that $13,000 was ""totally excessive"". Next while moving a dresser to use a power socket for my laptop I noticed a large red stain that seemed to have flowed from the headboard down to the carpet. My wife and I both thought it was blood (it had gone dark brown) the head of house keeping agreed, then disagreed. The on duty manager said it was red grease. we were skeptical and irrespective it was disgusting.The nail in the coffin was that my wife sent out her white jeans for cleaning and the came back as if they had been dropped in the dirt. They were filthy. It was the last straw for me. I complained about all this and was given a $300 room credit or a 3% discount on our entire stay.

Thank you Kahala hotel for saving us from Waikiki hell. Our stay here really made up for the nightmarish one night (which we barely lasted through) at the Sheraton Waikiki. We had such a lovely 2 week stay on the Big Island and planned on rounding our trip off in Oahu for a few nights before returning home. After the horrible experience we had at the Sheraton Waikiki, we quickly checked out early and decided to head over to the Kahala and it was the best decision made!The rooms are spacious, service first class and the private beach exclusively for Kahala guests was the cherry on top. Even the clientele here were a lot less obnoxious and more laid back. Above all, the service here is outstanding. From the valet/bell desk boys, front desk staff (James - thx for trying to help me print out my airline tix), and Lynn from housekeeping, you guys are all top notch. It's the little things that really count when it comes down to the competition between 5 star hotels on the island and yes, in my eyes you have surpassed the Halekulani in that respect. Just to give a quick example...the first night they only had king beds available for our small family (two young toddlers) and after returning back to our room later, the housekeeping staff had brought in a crib during turndown service without even requesting for one. Also, all our bath towels were replenished, my personal toiletries re-organized, my kids' stuffed toys were neatly tucked into bed & the iPhone/iPad chargers were all neatly looped and tucked nicely by the bedside table, beautiful Hawaiian music playing on the CD/ipod player and plumeria scent in the air, along with cold water bottles and ice filled in our ice bucket. It's the nice personal touches like this I appreciate as it separates this resort from the rest on the island. Even the basic mountain view room we booked had a spectacular view of the golf course and a side view of the ocean.

We were met at the airport by a car service provided by the hotel. Our driver Paul whisked us away and brought us to paradise.  The Kahala is located outside the city which for us was perfect. The lobby is beautiful. Understated elegance. The staff from the concierge to the front desk to the bellman were fantastic. Friendly, helpful, always smiling.  The room was gorgeous. A partial ocean view was quite nice. Not oceanfront but pretty good. The grounds are beautiful. Love the dolphins, stingrays, fish. Always fun to watch. The restaurants were nice. Fresh fish, lots of choices & beachfront.  The Kahala was probably one of the nicest hotels we've stayed at over the years. It's not cheap but you certainly get your money's worth.

It is a good value if you book 60 or 90 days in advance. Far away from the crowds at Waikiki, close to the restaurants in Kaimuki and a nice walk to Starbucks in the mall is easy. The beach is seldom crowded. Pool area and pool is too small, but great for kids. We like the large bathrooms with a full shower and a separate tub. Wifi is weak. No resort fee, but parking is not included and cabs are expensive to Waikiki. The hotel as looked the same for decades. Maybe it's time to upgrade.

I was reluctant to stay on/near Waikiki based on our stay ""on the strip"" 20 years ago. We were considering a stay on the North shore, possibly at the Disney Aluani or Turtle Beach and I am so glad our travel agent recommended the Kahala. The resort is a bit of a drive from the ""strip"" so be prepared to either rent a car or pay for taxi fare to and from that area. The resort was far enough away from the strip that it felt like we were on a different island this time. The resort is absolutely beautiful as soon as you walk in and see the beautiful open airy lobby that overlooks the wide deck to the ocean. I was impressed by the open and beautiful decor in the hotel hallways -- right up there with any Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons we have stayed at. The rooms were very spacious and the bathroom had two separate vanities, a separate toilet, jacuzzi tub, and rain shower stall. This bathroom also held two separate closets, a small fridge and coffee maker. The large room size was wonderful for our family of two adults and two teen girls. We never felt like we were stepping on each other. The resort grounds were just as beautiful. To get to the beach, you walk over bridges and ponds that hold seas turtles, sting rays, and dolphins -- we saw something different each time we crossed these ponds. The beach is long and pristine with private cabanas for each guest. The resort offers surf and stand up paddle lessons, and will take you out on a sailboat or canoe for a fee. We received a package that included the breakfast buffet each morning, and the food was delicious. My kids looked forward to the fried ""malassadas"" (donuts) each morning. Lunch by the ocean was nice as well as the drink service at the beach. We ventured outside the resort for dinner most nights. The one night we did stay, we had the resort buffet dinner. It was a bit of a let-down for the price we paid. I think that was the most expensive meal of our trip and we had a hard time finding foods that we could all enjoy (we felt the food choices were geared toward the Japanese/Asian guests). Aside from that one small blip, this resort was fantastic and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for luxury outside of the Waikiki strip.","Hudson, Massachusetts","jakpolk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hudson, Massachusetts</strong>",15,5.0

The hotel and the service is amazing. It is a 20 minute drive to Waikiki, so a car is a must. We each had a rental car, and used them every night! A tip: You probably will save money if you get a rental car, because there aren't too many restaurants nearby and we drove into Waikiki everynight and there are PLENTY of restaurants there! The hotel has a private beach, with water as calm as the Caribbean. There's always enough lounge chairs and towels. If you want a relaxing few days and just want to spend it at the beach, you won't be disappointed. The pool was OK, and small for a luxury hotel, but with such a wonderful beach, we didn't use it at all. They do have a Dolphin pool and you can swim with the dolphins. So, if you have small kids, that may be a fun thing to do one day. It's expensive though.The rooms were very nice & spacious, and beds super comfortable. The only negative is there's no ice dispenser on the floors, and you have to call for it. But they deliver very quickly. Their Breakfast buffet is another amazing thing at this hotel. The only other hotel I've had comparable quality breakfast at, was the Four Seasons hotels. So, don't miss the breakfast buffet. Usually breakfast for 2 is included with each night's stay, otherwise it was kind of expensive, but well worth it.all in all, it was an amazing stay.

It is a beautiful hotel, for us the best place to stay in Honolulu mostly because we do not like those tall hotel buildings in downtown Honolulu with all the noise and traffic around. The rooms are what you'd expect from a 5 star hotel, however in our room we could hear the wind whistling through what we think are windows that do not shut well. First day we thought someone in a neighbour room was playing a flute until we realized it was the wind. Not a big deal for us, we slept very well. The location is great, the staff is very nice and friendly, food is good. The thing that makes this place a no go for us is the bad experience at breakfast. It seems the tables are not cleaned properly, if you touch the table or the table mat you can feel how your fingers get gluey from the things the people who were there before had for breakfast/lunch/dinner. This is not 5 star experience, table at Mc Donnalds are cleaner + it was not an exception at one table. We had breakfast 4 times and it was the same at all those different tables. We were thinking of getting wet towels to clean up our table. Can you imagine that in a 5 star hotel?

We loved everything about it! It looked just like the pictures, which doesn't always happen.. it was very classy, clean, beautiful from top to bottom and the service could not be better. We did go into Waikiki and Honolulu, which was great, but the beach here was much less crowded so better for us. Our room was beautiful, the bed was extremely comfortable, we loved the turndown service, bottles of water on each side of the bed and Hawaiian music playing on the cd.. the room and the whole hotel smelled great everywhere.. the workout facility is small but has anything you want to have! Ate at all of the restaurants except Hoku's,(it was dress shoes and slacks only so not what we wanted) and they were all good. The breakfast buffet at Plumeria has it all and the view was perfect. Seaside grill has good food and is on the beach.. just a few steps away but they have shaded trees and canopies so if you don't want to eat right on the beach..(they will serve you there) you can go cool off and still have a great view! All around for us it was perfect in every way. The pool is small and it had kids in it the whole time but again, for us, this was ok. We spent our time on the beach.. and there were kids there as well but was not overcrowded and they did not bother us..just might have to bring our kids and grandkids next time! Also did the 15 minutes with the dolphins and loved it.. staff was informative and it was a great experience.","Darien, Illinois","690janetm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Darien, Illinois</strong>",32,5.0

Love that it was not over crowded, it was private and secluded from all the noises. Beach/pool service was good and I was really able to relax and enjoy myself. Did not have a hard time renting a cabana for the day. The only negative thing was the water system in the bathroom.

For us, getting away for a few days means none of the crowd and all of the peace without wanting or needing to leave the property. We can and do frequent 'the city' all the time. We're customers of the restaurants already, so our first stay still felt familiar. Ocean view room. Perfect. The dolphins were directly below our room! The Kahala has a homey, classy feel. There is a mix of modern and 'needs updating', but that's fine with us. We've stayed in upscale hotels in major cities before and the feeling of home was hardly present in those places. Why no 5 star review? Well, we would have loved better beach service and communication. 1) We were told that we could order breakfast from our cabana. Not true. I was told this prior to our stay and during our stay. 2) We wanted to have a cabana. I reserved one well before our stay, but when I did, I was told that even with a reservation, it was best to get it first thing in the morning. Guess what we cancelled? The buffet breakfast. That was upsetting. We wanted our buffet and our cabana and didn't see why that was something we had to stress about or not have guaranteed to us. 3) There were changes in our charges that didn't make it to the final bill. At check-out, the employee assured me all was set, but a quick glance at the itemization showed that we still had a buffet charge on there. He was gracious, but a few seconds of attention to detail would have been great. We work hard to relax and I did feel that we had to 'work' a bit during our stay for a simple breakfast, cabana and accurate charges. Loved 99% of the hotel and food service staff, the housekeeping service, our room, our view, the cabana, the Dolphin Quest/staff, the valet staff and the overall impression. I'm ready to return before the end of the year, but I do hope that a cabana reservation is just that...a reservation. It was a bit odd to order to-go from The Plumeria House in order to eat and enjoy the beach. Maybe it's not a cut throat situation, but that is how it was communicated to me by the pool staff. First come, first served, reservation or not.","Honolulu, Hawaii","TexNCajun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",0,4.0

Its our 4th time here during 4 past years. Its the first time we decided to share our opinion of the hotel. First and foremost, its certainly a unique hotel in Honolulu with great location and great privacy you can't find in Waikiki or around it. However, there are some developments the frequent visitors of The Kahala should be prepared for. 1. Restaurants:  - Instead of 'Tokyo Tokyo' there is a new Italian restaurant named 'Arancino'. They want to sell you a 4-5-course dinner for $85-100+tax+tips per person. Its a questionable value-for-your money when you are free to take a cab and go to Nobu's or Morimoto's in Honolulu and pay less money for a dinner from a developed brand name. - Also Arancino is now positioned as an ad-hoc restaurant for dinner available 7 days a week, while 'old dinosaurs' Plumeria and Hoku's are open 5 days a week only. + Watching Japanese guests of The Kahala at the moment when they are attempting to navigate through the Italian menu of Arancino, instead of the familiar waters of Tokyo-Tokyo, may be entertaining and make someones day. - 15-18% tips are printed by default on all bills for restaurant food/spa services etc. You must have a strong determination to wipe them out or modify the tips amount every other time. Its an old and legitimate revenue boosting trick, but we still couldn't figure out why there are tips included in a bill for a buffet breakfast we got within our accommodation package. Its a self-service, guys, its a pre-paid self-serices buffet breakfast. 2. Hotel quality: - Many places of the hotel are really worn out (by really we mean REALLY). For instance, the rugs from the main lobby to the dolphin and beach-front lanais have not been replaced for a century or so. Our fridge in the dolphin lanai was louder than a modern jet, etc. You may find in many similar reviews below a valid explanation to why its happening with many Honolulu hotels (high occupancy is warranted almost anyway). But the property is really crying for a refreshment. In comparison to many modern Caribbean hotels most of Honolulu hotels bring you back to 70s and 80s. It maybe a really nice thing if you are 50 and this is your 30th stay in The Kahala Hotel, but if you are only 30 it may be a little bit depressing. + Dolphins in the lagoon are really awesome. Its still very difficult to beat Kahala dolphins with anything in Honolulu.",New York,"Andrey Z</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",3,4.0

Service, cleanliness, staff dedication are all hard to beat. Cuisine is excellent, and the environment is great. Concierge is top quality. Rooms, even mountain view, provide you with great comfort and you won't miss anything (matresses are too soft though for my preference). The pool area is very confined however, with the pool itself being rather small - unbalanced with the rest of the resort. The Kahala maintains a large enclosure with dolphins; the mammals are very well taken care of, with dedicated curators and staff, and the water quality is top with careful monitorization. But keeping these animals captive - even weighing all the educational aspects of it - goes against current trends of thought and sensitiveness, and does not bring value to the resort, on the contrary, in my view. For me, it created a strange tension from which mixed feelings remained alive long after I left the resort. Still, the Kahala is very hard to beat, I want to emphasize that.","Lisbon, Portugal","Marmifero</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lisbon, Portugal</strong>",55,5.0

In saying this, most hotels in Honolulu are very tired as they seem to have high occupancy so don't need to bother refreshing them.Honolulu is an excellent destination for shopping and some nice restaurants but if you want the idyllic island get away go to Maui or Kona (I have only been to these two islands). 2 nights in Honolulu is heaps, if no kids go to Halekulani but they hate children and noise there so if young kids Kahala probably not a bad option.

Now I know picking Oahu is not necessarily the island for that as it is more fast paced than the other islands, but we have friends that live here, so we also had some visiting to do.Over the years I've been to Hawaii roughly 12-15 times and have visited Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai. I've also stayed at the Four Seasons in Kona and the St. Regis in Princeville, so these are some of the luxury hotels I'm judging Kahala against, and it simply cannot compare.I think the first issue I have with them is expectation. In reading their current ads which seem to be everywhere lately, they purport to be a very high-end, luxury hotel. And their prices are up there. But they do not have the service, amenities or style to compare, nor are their rooms that great. The lobby is lovely, and I think the rooms were probably really nice in the '90s. They provide a CD player, and some of the furniture has been painted in shabby chic stripes to hide its dated appearance. The bathroom has old composite granite for counters and in the shower where it is pulling away from the walls, the tub was old and had the built-in non skid surface that collects years of dirt no matter how much you clean it and the tile floors are pitted and cracked. Again, if we were paying for a basic hotel, no problem, but we were advertised a ""luxury"" stay, and this was not it.While the friendly people at the front desk can be lovely, I found the service around the pool to be lacking to non-existent. And while I'm on the subject of the pool, please be advised that they advertise the pool as luxurious. I kept wondering if there was another pool they were speaking about, because the only one I saw was extremely small and there was nothing relaxing about it. The lack of an adult pool in addition to a family pool simply means that the one and only pool is a veritable water park of children splashing and screaming. There is nothing at all wrong with that in itself, but if you expect to chill out by the pool and have some cocktails between naps, this is not the place where it's going to happen. At least not during summer break.A few other items: -Tropical Drinks: Not one restaurant in this complex can make a decent mixed drink. I don't know if they are using cheap booze or bad recipes but over the stay I tried 3 and gave up. The mai tais are just terrible. Go to the Royal Hawaiian or Halekulani if you want a great mai tai, you will NOT find them here.-Breakfast buffet: The free buffet that they serve in the morning is plentiful but (again, for a ""luxury"" hotel) inferior to almost any other buffet I've ever had on the island. The Sheraton is superior. The Sheraton. Kahala's eggs were rubbery, the oatmeal was too soggy to eat, the mashed potatoes tasted powdered and the waffles were dried out, overcooked and hard. All of the muffins and breads tasted pre-packaged from a big box supply house. Even though we had five days of free breakfasts coming to us, we gave up after the first day and ate elsewhere.-Fitness center: it is one of the most institutional I've ever seen. Not inviting. It's just a place to sweat and get out of there. I wound up working out in my room instead.All in all, this hotel is very average and quite basic. Do not be fooled by the high prices or the advertising luring you into a luxury hotel. I've stayed at many a luxury hotel, and this is not one of them.","Los Angeles, California","SophieBug</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",65,3.0

This is a high end hotel with many high end finishes and thoughtful touches. It is about 10 minutes away from Waikiki at the end of a long road in a residential area (very nice residential area, I might add). It is very serene, calming, and gracious. The food at the hotel is outstanding - not your typical hotel food which easily rivals some of the best restaurants that I have ever been too. If you are here on Friday or Saturday evening, consider the seafood buffet where you can stuff yourself silly with ahi poke, mussel poke, octopus poke, sashimi, sushi etc. There is a free shuttle service to Waikiki, but be sure to call ahead and reserve it as it only holds 15 people. The hotel itself is beautiful with many thoughtful features. Is it pricey? Yes...but oh what a memory of those few days.","rochester, mn","senye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>rochester, mn</strong>",8,5.0

The Kahala is not these things. My husband and I had our daughter later in life and before her arrival were lucky to have stayed at many fine establishments and do our best to find accommodations that incorporate those expectations while embracing children. The Kahala is comparable to many high end resorts in most ways and ideal for a 6 year old in tow. Is it the ideal romantic couple's resort? Probably not in my opinion, but we saw at least 5 weddings while we were there. So a lot of people thought so! In all honesty one of the main reasons we chose the Kahala was for the location of Dolphin Quest on the property. We had a fabulous experience and I am so glad we chose the program for our daughter's birthday. Another prime reason was location. It was removed enough from the main tourist tract that the resort felt isolated, which was a good thing. Go to Waikiki for craziness. We had excellent care given from all staff. Friendliness knew no boundaries. A few standouts were Ms. Carolyn Chung at the front desk. She added extra special touches to our stay, such as a piece of birthday cake waiting for our daughter. She also recommended a change in room location after hearing my girl was was a huge animal lover. We couldn't have had a better situation overlooking the dolphin lagoon. Her kindness was so appreciated. A second employee to mention was the manager at the Keiki Club. She was responsive from the beginning, returning phone calls and assuring me of the proper credentials she and the staff had. My girl had a great time and asked to stay longer. However, the clubroom needs an overhaul. Give her some upgrades in toys/supplies and ambiance! We looked forward to the breakfast buffet as it was part of our package. It rotated each day with options and the food was high quality and lacked the mass produced feel/taste of a kid friendly buffet. Lastly, the Seaside Grill had some really boutique style cocktails which were exceptional and well beyond the standard mai tai or pina colada. One suggestion for the Grill: Add just a couple more options to the menu. At day three we wanted to eat there because of its spectacular location (our girl could frolic on the beach as we ate) and the fancy drinks, but man, we wanted something different to eat! Oh yes, one extra tip. Take advantage of the tea service upstairs. It was pretty substantial and the setting was impressive. Spend 2 or 3 days out at the Kahala to experience Hawaiian hospitality at its best and then spend a couple more days out on the big island to experience something all together different. You will appreciate the Kahala even more. Okay,so a few are going to balk at the expense. Its not cheap at the Kahala, but here is an instance where you get what you pay for.

And, I've got to say, to me, this is what a really great hotel experience is all about- people. The people working at the Kahala seemed genuinely happy to be working there, and it showed. To each and every one of them, thank you.Loved the island style decor of the room at the Kahala, mountain view king bed number on a lower floor with a picturesque view of palms trees and greenery, and its size and layout.

Soft background Hawaiian music is heard as you enter the public areas. Our stay got better and better. Check in was oddly delayed by lots of keyboard clicking and repeated promises that room would be ready... soon..... Once we cleared that hurdle and made our own way to the room, we were pleased to see the pretty Tommy Bahama style room, with 2 double beds, a chaise lounge, desk, dresser and round table. Our balcony overlooked the golf course, with an ocean view. The bathroom was wonderful-his and her vanities, his and her closets, shower, tub, with hand held shower spray, lots of drawer and cupboard space, coffee bar counter, safe, and a separate toilet room. Tommy Bahama toiletries, chenille robes and wonderful big white towels completed the bath. WSJ delivered daily. Turndown service was provided nightly. Housekeeping staff was quiet and courteous. Parking is valet or self-park in the adjacent several story garage. For self-park, you will need a parking pass to exit the garage. Plumeria buffet breakfast was included with the room. The buffet included different specials each day, as well as Japanese options, and an omelet station. Try acai sorbet, guava juice, kahalasadas, rolled crepes, Japanese pickled vegetables over rice, Kahala coffee, and fresh papaya and pineapple! All excellent! For early coffee drinkers, visit the cart at the bottom of the staircase by the orchid wall. We booked our tours by phone with the hotel concierge prior to our arrival and all were ticketed and ready at check-in. We spent our afternoons at the Kahala beach and pool; chaircovers and towels are provided by the pool staff. Fascinated, we returned to watch the trained dolphins daily at the hotel's renowned Dolphin Quest. We often just stopped to sit for a moment on the rocking chairs on the porch to watch the dolphins play and the ocean spray!

While there were a few areas that they could improve upon, overall, it was a fabulous vacation and an excellent value in reality. I stayed at the Kahala Hilton many times as a child and had very fond memories of the vacations spent there, and wanted my husband and son to experience the same thing. We stayed at the Four Seasons Wailea for our honeymoon, so my husband's expectations were very high. The lobby still has the same awesomely vintage chandeliers, but the furnishings have that Hawaiian plantation look to them and there are plenty of spots to just sit and hang out. The rooms are quite large, as other reviewers have mentioned. We had a room with two double beds, as we shared a room with our 7 year old son. We had planned on he and I sharing a bed, but when we saw how large the divan that is in the room was, it was a perfect sized for him, so we just got extra sheets and blankets and he slept very comfortably on that the entire time. There have been a few complaints here and there about the bathrooms, but my husband I loved it. There are two sinks at opposite ends, each with it's own closet area nearby. The toilet room is a tad small, but really, how much time do you spend in there? We had a partial ocean view room, for which the rack rate is quite high, but with a promotion (which they run all the time) it came out to being quite reasonable in comparison to other comparable resorts. We could watch the sun rise over the ocean and Koko Head and that wasn't craning our heads around the balcony either - it really was a partial ocean view.For those expecting a giant Grand Wailea type pool, this hotel, as others have mentioned, was built in the 60s, and is surrounded by homes, etc., so is not getting any bigger. The pool is plenty big for kids and adults to hang out in, but this is not an amusement park type pool with waterslides, etc. The beach is maybe 50 feet from the pool, and speaking of the beach, it is a fabulous one if you have kids. There is a coral reef about 100 yards offshore, so it acts as a breakwater, and there are no waves to speak of. You won't be surfing here, but it's a wonderful spot to let your kids just hang out. My son spent a couple mornings in kids club, and the only bad thing was that there were only one or two other kids each day, as we were there when school is in session and not during a break. He thoroughly enjoyed the activities and wanted to go back. The food, overall, was excellent. We ate at the terrace restaurant (can't recall the exact name) that is between Hoku's and the lobby. We dined there twice and both times, it was very good. The breakfast buffet at the Plumeria is outstanding. We had a breakfast for two included with our room, and it was an excellent deal. There are many healthy options, as well as the more decadent ones. My only complaint, and it's not really that (because the fries were AMAZING), is the food by the pool. I wish there were more healthy options for ordering at the pool and beachside restaurant. My parents ate at Hoku's and said it was very good. One of the best parts of the Kahala is that you are 15 minutes away by car from Waikiki but you are hours away from the hustle and bustle and crowds of Waikiki. The Kahala has a free shuttle, which we found convenient most of the time. We did rent a car, but there is a Hertz car rental right in the hotel, so as long as you reserve in advance, you have the car right there. You can even rent by the day, which we did.They have excellent classes available through their Chi fitness center. My mom and I took a TRX yoga class which was great. I really wanted to the stand up paddleboard yoga class, which looked really nice as it was first thing in the morning when the water was like glass.The whole ambiance of the hotel just makes you say ""Ahhhhh"" and totally relax. I do have a few things which I think they should pay a bit more attention to. First of all, the servers by the pool could be hit or miss. The first day we arrived we waited quite a while to be served at the beach side restaurant. They are all young, so I understand that they may be new or what not, but perhaps a bit more training could be in order. Additionally, there were a few little things that one should not see at a five star hotel. There was a bit of rust at the bottom of the chairs at the pool bar, and some of the metal furniture on the balconies (which are huge) has rust as well. It is a tropical climate, and these things will happen, but some better emphasis on maintaining the little things would go a long way. There was some peeling paint on our bathroom door - not really noticeable unless you looked closely, but still...All in all, the Kahala is a wonderful oasis close enough but worlds away from Waikiki.

Upon arrival, we were upgraded to an Ocean Front One Bedroom Suite, a big upgrade over the regular partial ocean view. The view from the room was breathtaking, with views from Koko Head to Diamond Head, a great view of the pool, beach, and ocean, as well as a great view of the dolphin lagoon.Our first room had an issue with the air conditioner in the master bedroom, but the front desk quickly moved us to another room (the first room they tried to change us to had not been cleaned yet, but they quickly found us an ocean front suite that was clean and had a working A/C unit).Pros:-Great service-Great room/amenities-Awesome view-morning coffee and afternoon snacks delivered to the room-Great restaurant for or complimentary breakfast (AMex Plat.) -Dolphins!-A semi-private beach that you could always find a quite place on-Away from the hustle/bustle of WaikikiCons:-Not a big fan of the Tommy Bahama bathroom supplies-A/C issue described above (but quickly taken care of)-Very family friendly, which obviously is not a con if you have your family, but we noticed all the kids when we were trying to have a ""second honeymoon"".

I have gone into great detail in prior reviews so I will focus on something new.We booked our stay after receiving an email about a limited time offer they had. We have received these before and used them. If you are considering the Kahala, get on their email list. It is definitely worth it.The offer we used was a greatly reduced rate on the Partial Ocean View Suites and we are thrilled that we booked it. We have tried several room categories from Dolphin Lagoon, Ocean Front Lanai to Ocean Front Suite. Obviously the Ocean Front Suite was awesome but not exactly the most cost conscious. So when we received an offer for the POV Suite we decided to give it a try. First of all, I thought based on the room map that the view would not be great. I could not have been more wrong! In some ways, the view was better than the Ocean Front. We had a much more panoramic view of the hills, golf course AND the ocean. Yes, it is not as flat out ocean view, but you absolutely can see plenty of it. (We were on the 5th floor of 10 which was great.)Having the extra space was awesome including two full bathrooms, a living room and the lanai.Plus, with the suite, even at the special rate, we had the suite amenity package which included transfers to and from the hotel, a beach cabana every day, breakfast, afternoon drinks and snacks, morning coffee, etc. For us, it was definitely worth it, especially given that the offer was at a rate lower than some non-suite room categories.As always, the food was uniformly awesome from the breakfasts, to the Veranda to the fish tacos on the beach. I particularly appreciate the hotel’s flexibility. We had originally booked only 3 nights but we were able to add a 4th night at the original rate no problem at all.The hotel also delivered a nice bottle of champagne in honor of our anniversary which was an improvement over last year.If we had it to do over, we would have stayed all 7 nights at the Kahala, but such is life.We will definitely be back as this may well have been the best stay.","Orange County, California","SarahInSoCal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",166,5.0

So, if you prefer not to stay in one of the hotels located on the crowded, noisy, and ""touristry"" main drag of Honolulu, The Kahala is the perfect place for you.The service is impeccable as is the food offered in the on-site restaurants, namely Hoku's and the Plumeria Beach House. The lobby and grounds are lovely and very well maintained, as are the guest rooms. And, the hotel is noted for the array of celebrities who have stayed at this beautiful and secluded hotel over the years. Make sure to check out the ""Wall of Fame,"" which features photographs of numerous celebrities who have stayed at The Kahala. Who knows, you may even catch a glimpse of someone famous while there!Note that the hotel rates/fees can be quite expensive, but during the low season some decent rates and packages can be had. Make sure to check on-line for Kahala's ""Internet Rates"" and special packages no matter what time of year you go.Last but not least, the entire staff goes out-of-their-way to make sure that you feel special and pampered. They often go above and beyond to accomodate you and your requests and to ensure you have a wonderful and memorable vacation.Even if I don't stay at The Kahala while in Hawaii (we sometimes stay at the Hale Koa military hotel), I still have to stop in at The Kahala for lunch or a coctail, because my visit to Honolulu just wouldn't be complete without a few hours at this beautiful and timeless landmark!","Detroit, Michigan","likestotravel16</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Detroit, Michigan</strong>",24,5.0

It is a little quieter than Waikiki but the relaxation and enjoyment you will have will be worth it.We checked in early and they provided us with a magnificent standby room so we can refresh ourselves from our flight, haves shower and just relax until our room was ready.Only around 35mins we waited and they provided us with a room which was super quick as we arrived at11am. The staff and service was wonderful and they all knew your name straight away once you gave it to them once.Our room was lovely. It was huge, big balcony plus huge bathroom with separate shower and separate bath also with a shower. 2sinks so I used one side and my husband the other which was great.The room we had faced the mountains with partial ocean view. Honestly this was breathtaking. Even if you can't afford an ocean front room, it doesn't matter because mountain view is also stunning.The resort is very nice as there is a private beach which is fabulous as it isn't busy like Waikiki and the service is great as they bring you towels and fold out bed towel covers. The ocean is at first very shallow which is great for kids or not confident swimmers. The pool side is lovely as there is a smallish pool but one for adults and one for kids plus a hot warm spa too. The best thing about this hotel is that there are dolphins.there were 6 male dolphins and I could sit there watching them all day as they were magnificent. The trainers are very informative and friendly and its very good for taking pictures.Overall amazing. Only down side is location but it makes up for it with the little touches such as providing water for you every day even when you go on a trip, extra towels, directions how to get anywhere, wireless Internet, shuttle bus to go into Waikiki.Only thing I would suggest is to have more shuttle times and a bigger bus because you have prebook as they get busy. The last bus is at 845pm which isn't late at all.

What they don't realize is that outside of Waikiki and Honolulu, Oahu has the most beautiful beaches in the Hawaiian Islands. Fortunately there are other places to stay while on the Island. One such place is The Kahala Resort in the Kahala section of Honolulu - basically it's the Beverly Hills of Oahu. This area, though only 10 minutes outside of Waikiki may as well be on another island completely. The road to the resort dead ends into the hotel in an area nestled between the Pacific Ocean and the Waialae Country Club Gold Course. An oasis of comfort, quiet and relaxation. Every room is decorated in color palates that are peaceful and serene overlooking either the ocean, the dolphin lagoon, or the golf course - with the exception of the least expensive rooms - which overlook the vast courtyard and circular driveway in front of hotel which has its own unique charm. The rooms house the most practical and fantastic bathroom areas you will see in any hotel. They have sinks on opposite sides of the bathroom and all your closet and drawer space is essentially in this room - allowing the visitor to basically store everything out of their immediate sleeping area. The staff is exceptional. One would assume that the best hotel employees of the island work here. From check in to maid service. From the pool service to food service, this place is unique. You even get your own beach (though beaches in Hawaii are all public, this beach is not easily accessible if you're not staying at the hotel - so it may as well be private). The beach is protected by an enormous reef, so it's very calm for the kids. Speaking of kids, there are dolphins housed in the lagoon overlooking the pool area. The sounds of the dolphins jumping in the water, the gentle trade winds, the gentle crash of the ocean waves all contribute to this celestial experience. Save your money, treat yourself and go here. Vacations are meant to create memories for families and should never be marred by hotel horror stories in the name of saving a few bucks. That's how vacations are ruined! This simply won't happen here. Be prepared to feel some guilt as you will undoubtedly feel you don't deserve this.

No matter what spa treatment you pick, you have your own suite to enjoy with a tub where the water falls from the ceiling. I truly wished I could have experienced a treatment there. The rooms are beautiful as well as the views. Each room decor is different and hand picked so each room is different. You walk into your room and light music is already playing. The balconies are huge as well as the bathroom. You feel more like you are staying at a friend's house than at a hotel. There is a fun lagoon where dolphins live.

Great live music from the piano at night.Seaside Grill is a great place to grab lunch while swimming in the pool or snorkeling in the ocean.The view from the room was great!

Always with a smile and a warm Aloha. They took care of our room as if it was the room of the biggest VIP.The best part of the room was the nightly turn down service. They would always leave a small surprise on the bed (orchid buds) and have soft Hawaiian music playing on the CD player. Two bottles of water would be left on the nightstands. They even replaced a small cup of water my wife had some flowers in with fresh water for the flowers.

The location is great for those (us) wanting to get away from all the tourist traffic, as it is about 15 minutes from Waikiki. (car necessary) The rooms were a good size, extremely comfortable beds (note: 2 beds = 2 doubles, not queens), and the bathrooms were very spacious...overall lovely. The staff were professional and pleasant; good service but nothing offered that was above and beyond. The grounds and beach are very nice, and the dolphin encounter must be their claim to fame (great for just watching ... probably a blast to participate). My criticisms were that they charge for parking (I find this tacky...like someone charging a house guest to park in the driveway), the website is misleading about the tennis courts (They belong to a club next door and it is $30+/hr pp to play!), and the biggest downer for me, the attention to room cleanliness. Although our room was lovely at first glance, it had soiled upholstery (a chaise lounge, which they did remove at my request), a tired carpet, and tile missing (only one) in the bathroom. These concerns would be not as big a deal if I were staying at a place where the price and reputation warranted it, but this place is expensive by Honolulu standards and has a high reputation. Overall we really did enjoy the resort and would recommend it...it's just that first impression when you walk into your room with high expectations and were a little let down. The concern was addressed, but nothing additional was ever offered. (Note: I had paid for 4 nights and only used 3 (my doing), but thought that because of that and the room issue that they would upgrade me to a better room...they didn't).","Shanghai, China","JJHigh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",47,4.0

We were upgraded to a ""partial ocean view"" but the ""partial"" was more than adequate; also included was the sumptuous breakfast buffet. We ate almost every night here as the food was amazing, varietal, local and seasonal, which coming from the midwest is saying something in the winter. We were advised well by the concierge for activities-especially the tidbit of taking a taxi to/from Diamond Head-the parking there is so very limited, and to get there early.  We loved watching the Dolphin Experience, the fish, turtle and ray lagoons as well as having yoga in an outdoor setting, seeing beautiful flowers everywhere and anything you could possibly want at hand.

She also held her wedding reception and celebration at the Waialae Room, and stayed at the absolutely fabulous suite at the hotel. Though we are far from VIPs, everyone at the Kahala bent over backwards, went the extra mile, and tried to do everything possible to make this wedding and reception the best, with the quality of service usually reserved only for the most elite and special clients. No task, no detail was too large or too smail ---- they would always walk the extra mile to insure that their guests were comfortable, happy and well taken care. They truly want you to have an absolutely wonderful experience.The reception cuisine was outstanding --- from the main courses (mahimahi with special sauce), to the the various salads, veggies and desserts.There are so many outstanding Kahala Associates --- starting with former Wedding and Catering Coordinator, Aimee Graham. Though promoted just yesterday to Sales Manager at the Kahala, she nevertheless kept her word and was there today as our wedding coordinator. Everything went just like the bullet train -- so smoothly, seamlessly and on time. She did anything and everything to making it all work. Like the duck that seems to glide on the water, she seemed to do everything so easily and gracefully, but underneath the water she and all the other Kahala Associates were working so hard on our behalf. Your services will be truly missed at future Kahala weddings.Nicole, one of the first that we knew and met at the Kahala - thank you so much as the Kahala wedding experience was everything and more. We cannot thank you enough for everything small and large that you and all the Kahala Associates did for us today.Carolyn M. Chung was the second person we met by phone and then in person in connection with our daughter and son in law's suite and check in. Though it wasn't part of her job description, in coordination with Aimee who was at another wedding at the time, she made sure that we could rehearse in the ballroom because it was raining outside by the waterfall. Together with Aimee, they made sure our wedding party's parking validation was taken care ---- no task was too small for them to make sure it went right. Like Nicole, Aimee, Carolyn made us feel welcome --- like we were now part of the Kahala family.The suite was outstanding ---- the view terrific from the lanai and everything so special and perfect. Our son in law said it was one of the best rooms he has ever had the privilege of enjoying.Michael at the Waialae Room thank you so much. I have never seen anyone try so hard to make sure that everything went right at the reception for the bride and groom as you did. We noticed when you even wanted to make sure that the bride got special tea, and always made sure the guests received anything and everything to make them happy and comfortable. We noticed that you stayed until the very end to make sure everyone got their validations for parking, had all their stuff and packages taken to the cars or rooms, and even, together with Aimee, helped snuff out the candles and pack the glass candle holders so they could take it with them. It wasn't their job ---- but it just got done, with a smile and with grace. When we thought we should go, Michael, I will always remember you saying ""no need to rush, you are our special guests, we want you to have a wonderful experience."" Duane also was always there to make sure the set up was right, and everything went smoothly.The Kahala Associates that helped us with our packages and things, got our cars so quickly, and always had a warm smile and welcome to the Kahala when we arrived, and a thank you and come see us again as we left were also the best.No one at the Kahala ever says it's not our job when you ask for help. Anna Hinkley who I think may be the new wedding coordinator answered the telephone when I called Aimee's telephone number. After not being able to contact Aimee, Anna asked if she could take a message for Aimee or help us. When I explained that someone had lost a family heirloom in the ballroom, she asked if she could have my phone number as she was a floor above the ballroom and could go right down now and check the ballroom for the item and call me back. Fortunately, meanwhile, the family heirloom was found, but it just goes to show you how far each of the Kahala Associates, I believe, will go in order to make it a wonderful and special experience for all.The Aloha Spirit is NOT dead and gone in Hawaii --- it is alive and well at The Kahala in each and every Kahala Associate. I hope this review is printable and that the general manager at The Kahala will see it and will pass it on to the several named individuals above and to the many other Kahala Associates not mentioned by name but who played a part in making this such a special and fantastic celebration.As legendary Bob Hope would end, I borrow in saying at the end of this thank you ----- TO ALL THE ASSOCIATES, ""THANKS FOR THE MEMORIES.""

The staff were great too all of them. Loved the layout, the beach, the pool, the fish, turtles. Its a comfortable place. We had a mountain view, no lanai. It would have been nice to have a balcony but we only stayed 2 nights. We arrived after a long flight and travel and found our room was ready. Very impressed! The rooms were a great size but the beds were small. We had two doubles. They were a little small for a child that moves around all night and an adult. They were comfortable though. It was extra for a rollaway and the rooms were expensive anyway, so we didn't get one. The rooms are very quiet, relaxing. The Kahala has its own slice of paradise.I also liked two vanity basins in the bathroom. This was very convenient. If you are an Aussie be careful about what is on offer on the TV for children. Unsensored TV in the daytime (after 11pm stuff here) scary sci-fi. So we just turned it off. Maybe ask the staff which channels are best. The beach is very nice with many sunbeds. If there arn't enough the staff will get you one. No umbrellas though unless you paid for a cabana. The water temperature was beautiful. We loved seeing the dolphins everyday and never tired of their antics. An inclusive kids club would have been good. No free activities during our stay. The other strange thing was that other families (not sure whether they were local) didn't let their kids play with our daughter. Weird, stranger danger taken too far!!!! After all it cost over $3,000 to get to Hawaii just in airfare alone. Breakfast was good and we got an inclusive package. Good selection, nice omelettes, attentive staff. The tables were near the ocean i a lovely setting. Other food at the hotel was good too, pricey but its what you expect from a 5 star resort. It wasn't too far from Waikiki but we stayed in Waikiki after our time at Kahala. Check out whole foods at the Kahala shopping centre. Great food, great selection of fresh food.We had a car so explored the coast south of Kahala (a must) and had dinner at Roys at Hawaii-Kai. A great place to eat and watch the sunset.! We didn't use the shuttle but it seemed to be available. Worth a stay.

Overall, I am happy to report that my choice of the Kahala resort did not disappoint. It is located only 15 minutes by taxi or shuttle away from Waikiki (which we visited several times for dinner and oh boy, it is like a human zoo in concrete jungle), yet Kahala resort totally felt like a piece of paradise away from crazy crowds and super crowded Waikiki beaches. The resort is located right on the beach front and it is a perfect location for romantic getaways and families traveling with children.We stayed in Partial Ocean view room and paid extra to stay there versus Mountain View room. Was it worth it? Absolutely not! Don't take me wrong, the room itself was absolutely perfect with everything you need, very spacious, with super comfy bed, huge bathroom with shower and a separate deep bathtub, lots of space to feel like you are living in a spacious apartment. However, the Partial Ocean View is truly a golf-course view room. There is absolutely no way you can see the ocean or any part of the ocean from your room, but you can see a tiny piece of beach and tiny piece of the ocean if you go outside on the balcony, get very close to the railings and look all the way to the right. In my honest opinion, I have no idea why Kahala even came up with Partial Ocean View category and charges more for it. We were not able to take even one single photo of us standing on the balcony with the partial ocean view on the background unless we compromised our safety while trying to capture tiny view of the ocean. But, regardless of this issue, we were so pleased with the room itself that I would not take down any stars from my review. In all fairness, Kahala website specifies that partial ocean view is only available from the balcony, but I think they should make it much more clear that it is hardly any view at all so that people don't pay extra $$ per night for something that doesn't really exist. On a very positive note, the view from Partial Ocean View rooms to the surrounding golf course with swaying palm trees and mesmerizing mountains is just as breathtaking and truly remarkable. I was not disappointed with the view even though it was not what I originally expected. To top it off, we could clearly see the Dolphin Lagoon right down below our room from the balcony and all rooms in this category that include a balcony should have a very nice view of the Dolphin Lagoon. Now, originally I debated if I should book Dolphin Lagoon room, but decided not to because I wasn't sure if the water in the lagoon would be fresh and free of any smell. I am happy to report that these issues are of no concern at all. We spent every day hanging out at the dolphin lagoon and the water is sparkling clean in the lagoon. In fact there is a waterfall that pumps water from the ocean continuously, so the water is always clean and fresh. If I were to return to Kahala, I would definitely book Dolphin lagoon room. Rooms in this category are located in a separate 2-story building that surrounds the lagoon and each room had a balcony or patio area and all appeared to have great, unobstructed views of the lagoon and playful dolphins. If you do consider booking a Dolphin lagoon room, I would recommend requesting a room on the second floor as you would get a much-much better view of the entire lagoon and dolphins playing in it. Now on to dolphins! This is probably one of the best features of the entire resort. Absolutely amazing!! The dolphins that live at the resort are so well cared for and so loved! I read some reviews prior to our arrival that spoke negatively about dolphins kept in captivity, but you should definitely take time to get to know people who care for them to learn each dolphin's story before jumping to any negative conclusions or passing on judgement for the resort. Each dolphin caregiver that we met was delighted to share their knowledge about dolphins and share with everyone who is willing to listen interesting stories about all their dolphins and various projects that the resort is participating in. It is quite an experience! I could see that each and every dolphin is so well taken care of, so loved, and so happy to be there. They play day and night even when noone is around them, it's just so incredible to experience. Our 9-month old baby was way too young to appreciate the dolphins, but older kids would definitely have a lot of fun learning about dolphins at this resort. The resort also has sea turtles, fish and manta rays and hotel guests can participate in daily feedings as well as learning about their life. Definitely a great experience to be part of!The resort grounds were beautiful, clean and never appeared too crowded even though the hotel was pretty much at full capacity. There is always something to do around the resort. They offer daily exercise classes that are pretty unique ($25 per class), such as balance yoga in the ocean on the paddle board, TRX suspension training, foam roller classes and various yoga classes. They also have a nice gym with modern equipment and super spacious area for women/men jacuzzi and sauna (it is hidden near the gym and we didn't even discover it until several days into our stay.) The beach was always perfectly cleaned and we never had any issues finding a great shade area to relax. Pool staff was always super friendly and helpful, setting up chairs for you and generally making sure you are having a good day at the beach. Everyday that we stayed at the resort there was a wedding going on. On weekends there were two per day. The resort has a nice white gazebo near the beach where all weddings took place and from what we saw all weddings were nicely organized. However, if I were to look for a wedding location, Kahala would not be on my choice list to consider. It is an amazing resort but in my opinion, not a great setting for a wedding. Why is that? First of all the location of this wedding gazebo is just truly unfortunate. It is located just literally steps away from the main restaurant where all guests have daily breakfast buffet and lunch (and morning weddings take place at 11am during breakfast hours), so you have bunch of hotel guests sitting literally 7 steps away from your wedding location eating breakfast while you are getting married. And another thing is that wedding gazebo is located directly in front of the entrance/exit from the gym, also about 20 steps away and it looked kind of weird having beautifully dressed people and lovely brides in flowing white dresses standing right next to the gym where sweaty people enter and exit with towels hanging across their shoulders. I don't know. Maybe I am too picky, but in my travels I have seen much better choices (more romantic, more dramatic, more interesting) than this particular location. However, people who we actually observed getting married over there (pretty much all of them were Japanese from Japan) didn't appear to care and truly enjoyed their special day. Now about the restaurants on the property. We had breakfast buffet included in our room rate, otherwise it looked like breakfast buffet was about $85 for two people on weekdays and about $94 for two people on weekends. Breakfast was delicious and plentiful: eggs made to order, fresh fruits (watermelon, papaya, strawberries, melons, etc.), lots of hot items (meat, fish, potatoes, baked zucchini, etc.), yogurt, pastries and even acai sorbet - delicious! I never got tired of breakfast buffet, it was yummy and fresh every single morning. We also had lunch in the restaurant by the beach (can't remember the name) - it was delicious and a great setting - right on the beach with excellent service. Other restaurants were just as good and delicious, with friendly service and interesting menus. The resort offers complimentary shuttle bus to Waikiki and nearby shopping mall - Kahala Mall, that has Whole Foods in it. Make sure to get shuttle schedule from front desk and reserve your space on the shuttle, we learned a hard way that shuttle spaces in the evening to and from Waikiki are often booked in advance. So, few times we had to take taxi to Waikiki for dinner (read my reviews about restaurant experience in Oahu.) Taxi would cost you about $20 each way, sometimes even more depending on traffic in Waikiki, so free shuttle bus helps. We had a great experience with concierge service, always friendly and helpful, though it seemed like they recommend exact same restaurant choices to everyone (usually on the expensive side.)Overall, a great vacation at Kahala, I really loved the resort and would highly recommend it to anyone. Unless you are familiar with Waikiki and know exactly what you are getting yourself into, don't book any hotel in Waikiki - it is super crazy, busy, dusty and just looks exactly like something you would see in Las Vegas - tons of people moving back and forth inside huge hotel lobbies and overcrowded beaches that don't resemble paradise. The Kahala, on the other hand, is a true paradise on Oahu.","San Francisco, California","kismika</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",119,5.0

At the Kahala, they take care of every detail, from start to finish. The rooms are so nice/big, and the view is amazing from any room. I also liked how the hotel is small and intimate. We stayed there as part of a wedding party, and everyone in our group was thoroughly impressed with the service. When we checked in, they asked how old our child was and what her name was. They brought up a crib without being asked, and our nephew had his name put onto 2 giant cookies. They also gave all the kids in our party stuffed animals. The bride and groom had 3 complimentary bottles of champagne + chocolate covered strawberries delivered to their room. Every time we saw someone in the hallways, they were super friendly, and the dolphin staff was also very approachable/educational. I never thought of this as a kids hotel before, but the nice pool, calm/secluded beach, and animal/recreational activities all make it a very kid-friendly hotel. It was well worth the price, and was much more bang for our buck then any other hotel we have stayed at with similar cost. The location is awesome- outside of the hustle of Waikiki, but close enough that its very convenient, plus plenty of great places to eat in the Kahala area.

We have stayed here three times now, over the years. We keep coming back because it is just such a carefree and comfortable way to enjoy Oahu. We usually take a taxi from the airport here when we first arrive from the mainland. It helps to know we don't have to make a connection or rent a car, etc., upon our arrival. The trip from the East Coast of the mainland is arduous enough without dreading further hassles upon arrival. Taxis are always waiting in front of the airport (check in with airport attendants at the taxi stand, who will make sure you get the next available cab, and that the taxi is legitimate). Taxi fare from and to the airport averaged us around $46.00 before tip, one-way.We find the staff at this resort just simply OUTSTANDING. We are older, seasoned Hawaii travelers...so we've sifted through all the options and now only stay at hotels with great employees and management. Almost all my hotel reviews are five stars because of that. No use traveling 5 thousand miles one way to stay less than great. Please don't think I hand out praise indiscriminately, though...I just choose very carefully to begin with.Loved the latest stay and wished we could have lingered longer. Next time we will. Rooms larger than average, beds super comfortable, atmosphere relaxed and welcoming, staff attentive. Best of all, though, is the BEACH. It's large, sheltered by breakwaters and its natural cove shape, right out front of the hotel, soft sand, free lounging chairs which the pool attendants will cheerfully outfit with chair covers and towels (we tipped of course, but no formal charge for these). The beach is easy for children or older people to negotiate, but anybody would love it, and it's gorgeous as well. The water is warm and gentle, the underwater slope EXTREMELY safe and gradual. You could sit there all day and never grow tired of the view. I especially like sitting under the spreading shade trees where the grass meets the beach. Really sweet. AND the folks from the poolside cafe make regular trips out there to serve you...even if you're all the way down the beach near the end of the property.No resort fee. I like that because I don't want to be burdened with a car there, and I hate paying a resort fee that includes parking...like so many large resorts. If you want to go to Waikiki or the Ala Moana Shopping or Kahala Shopping Centers, you can take the free hotel shuttle, which runs about every hour. You can tell by this review that I expect to pay top dollar for my room or my meals (if they are worth it, as they are here), BUT I do NOT like to pay for a lot of extras). I don't feel nickeled and dimed here like I do at many other Hawaiian resorts.Food options were in flux while we were there. We were surprised that our favorite on-site eatery...the beachside Plumeria Beach restaurant was closed on Sunday and Monday nights. We arrived on Sunday, ready to relax there for our first night's decompression... and that made us sad. Hope they change that, and soon.They were getting ready to open a new Italian restaurant where the Japanese restaurant/Sushi bar used to be (on the front-side of the hotel), but it wasn't open yet. Dinner and lunch menu at Plumeria Beach has changed since our last visit, and now includes more Asian type dishes (we'd like to see just a bit more choices). Staff there treated us like royalty...especially Joy, the superb hostess/manager. The breakfast buffet (also in Plumeria Beach) is just excellent. Definitely get a breakfast package when you stay here. Another treat: high tea on the Veranda lounge...even my husband liked it (yes, it's true, and he is NOT the high-tea (or even middle or low-tea) type! : ) We don't eat at Hoku's (not feeling like dressing up or making the effort most times). All food and drink at the Kahala is, well, it's just plain expensive. Just understand that going in and plan for it...it's no different anywhere else worthwhile in Hawaii. At least, you get what you pay for here.Here's a tip about restaurants in this hotel: they are heavily patronized by local residents, especially at holiday time, so if you're coming then, make your dinner reservations before you arrive (we stayed once in December and many office parties, family gatherings, etc. were being held both in public restaurants and in private banquet facilities). We also noticed many local families in the restaurant this time (March) as well, because the schools were on Easter break. I'd eat here regularly, too, if I were lucky enough to live in the Kahala neighborhood.We are thinking about making another trip from the DC area to Hawaii some day soon. We figure we could take the new non-stop flight from Dulles Airport and be in Honolulu by mid-afternoon, taxi out to the Kahala, and just settle there for the whole vacation. As we get older and airports get more annoying, we look for ways to make it easier on ourselves. If you have to pick one island, Oahu has a lot going for it. We also find that there are more attractive flight options (wide-bodies, non-stops, lower prices and more frequent flier seats available) for incoming mainlanders as opposed to outer islands. If you stay here at the Kahala, you have the outer-island feeling of being isolated and on the beach...but you can have a wealth of other cultural, entertainment, and scenic options easily at hand. The concierges are SO helpful...and can get you a car any time you want it, so you can explore the island.Lots of families with children were staying here this time (spring break). Usually I avoid hotels with this demographic, but you aren't really affected so much--especially if you sit down toward the end of the beach, away from the swim platform (I like that better anyway). The hotel does not FEEL crowded, even when it is full (not noisy at all, and I attribute some of this to the fact that it is not U-shaped like so many hotels on the beach...those high-rise hotels that have pools in the middle seem to serve as echo chambers for children's delighted squeals...the kind that can cut through you like a knife sometimes). It also has cleverly-designed landscaping and made-made waterfalls that absorb noise.You just have to understand that there may be a lot of children in the (rather small) pool and the one nearby hot tub. If that takes away from it for you (it does me), then go to the free fitness center beachside and use the adults-only hot tubs (gender-specific)...really hot, really clean, and usually empty. There, you also have the use of saunas, steam rooms, showers, exercise equipment, and lockers at the same time. Quite nice! And all perfectly free. (and did I mention grownups only?)The Dolphins are always enchanting, the waterfall landscaping lovely, the grounds beyond beautiful. It's easy to get around without hiking long distances. I honestly love this place.","Washington, DC","rothea</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",138,5.0

This was a big disappointment and by far the biggest waste of money. I've put my point form review below.- First impression was one of bad service. Not greeted very well as our car, then rushed through the check-in process. Literally rushed, and told they were busy.- The room was adequate, the view over the parking lot did distract from the sea. I would hesitate to call is an ocean view room. The washroom amenities were definitely not 5 star, more a 3 - 3.5 star if I'm generous. - The cleaning staff did not speak english (those we dealt with) and was very difficult to communicate our needs.- the concierge was ok, although woefully out of date on restaurant changes.- the staff at breakfast were excellent and very well trained, the view was also spectacular, although every morning at that same time there were workmen grinding the tree branches that they had previously cut down. This happened every day.- They were terribly stingy with their water, they only gave us 2 bottles at turndown and wanted to sell us more at an exorbitant price. That left us with no choice but to go off site and buy our own water. I had not seen this at any 5 star hotel in the past- The staff at the pool was non-existent. There were staff there, but they didn't acknowledge us or help us in any way. All of the chairs were stacked up and not available to use and the pool was uncleaned, with debris floating in it. There was also no shade available. Needless to say this was not an inviting environment.- Since we couldn't be by the pool we went back to our room. But there were people smoking on the balcony beneath us and we could not sit outside. This is a non-smoking hotel. I think what amazed me the most was that the valet could clearly see what was going on and did noting. We did call and they came but am not sure what the resulting action was.- during our last 2 days there was construction taking place and shook our entire room so we couldn't even be inside, we decided to leave the hotel as that was our only option. I told the front desk about the problem and they said upon our return they would have a solution. When we arrived back, they said we could have a choice of some different rooms that were better than ours. That was untrue as they were the exact same, only offering a reprieve from the noise. However, the rooms they were recommending were in the same area just a little higher and still had the sound of the construction. I was paying full price for absolutely horrible service and a horrible environment. - the equipment in the gym was old with only 2 of the 5 treadmills functioning properly. You could see that the other equipment was not properly functioning either.- this hotel has a lot of hype that is not at all true- Unfortunately I can't recommend this hotel to others, as it was by far and away our worst overall hotel experience on the islands and even compared to other trips we have done. I only hope they make some changes to improve the customer experience.","Guelph, Canada","mbfa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guelph, Canada</strong>",17,2.0

The pool and ocean view are charming and intimate, the lighted pathways with torches were beautiful, the dolphins were a highlight for our 11 year old who took a class with them. The breakfasts were amazing...especially the maple butter pancakes!!! Someone is still dreaming about them. The hotel staff were very helpful for booking day trips and any information. The only thing that I would suggest changing is the double rooms have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds for families. But, it wasn't a big deal. We loved a side trip whale watching that we took and you must go to the Polynesian Cultural Centre it is so nice for families and adults...it's like a mini Epcot Centre without the rides!!

The outstanding focus on service is evident from the moment you arrive at Kahala with with valet parking staff. This group of individuals perfectly balanced friendly service, professionalism and enthusiasm. They were always willing to provide directions, give recommendations and typically would address us by name. Upon checking in, we were pleased to learn that we had been upgraded to a partial ocean view room. While it overlooked the front entrance of the hotel, it was a nice treat to see the ocean from our room. We sacrificed having two beds (our son slept on the small sofa at the foot of the bed) to have breakfast included with our room rate. This was a well made decision. Breakfast at the Plumeria Beach House is excellent with a wide range of choices, more than enough to suit every palate. That said, if it hadn't been included with our stay, I doubt we would have eaten there as our daily bill for breakfast was over $80 and that seems exceptionally steep (considering how much we actually eat). If you do plan on eating there, I strongly recommend arriving close to opening at 0630hrs as it gets very crowded and busy as the morning progresses. We went around 0800hrs on our last day and it was too busy to enjoy. The location of Kahala is excellent for those looking to be away from the business of Waikiki. It is an easy drive into town and is close to both Hanoma Bay and Koko Head Crater. I agree with other reviewers that the pool is small for the size of the resort. It was very windy during our stay so we did not spend much time on the beach. The pool was full of families playing (worked well for us having a child but I can see how adults looking to relax might find it a bit annoying). Those we spoke to who did the dolphin experience said the enjoyed it greatly but it seemed a bit cost-prohibitive for a short period of time with the dolphins.As other reviewers have mentioned, Kahala seems to cater to the wedding (on the beach) crowd. During our stay, there was at least one wedding daily, sometimes two. It is a beautiful location although it felt a bit strange to be returning to our room following a dip in the pool or ocean as a bridal party was preparing in the lounge near the elevators.I believe having a rental car is a must when staying here though as the shuttle service fills up quickly and you must book your return time in advance (we tried to change our return without success so found ourselves killing an extra couple of hours Waikiki while waiting to return to the resort). Overall, our experience at Kahala was positive and I would recommend it to anyone who was looking for a relaxing holiday away from Waikiki but who was keen to leave the resort for meals and activities.","Victoria, Canada","24JillH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",37,4.0

The entire staff from the valet, bell, front desk, concierge, restaurant & pool were all accommodating in every way. I wouldn't say the pool area is too small as others have posted, but it was just the right size to have an eye on the kids in any direction and feel safe with them having some independence. The pool service, bar & food were all excellent. I loved the ability to have a private cabana, chairs or a lounge on the beach and have beach service!My husband & I had the best time relaxing on the beach while the kids played in the sand, then ordered lunch with some delicious cocktails. All with the raise of the flag they provide for you to use when you needed service on the beach. That is a vacation at its best!The dolphin lagoon was a big hit, we could view them anytime of the day, including the turtles & stingray. Very educational in a fun environment...yes to swim with the dolphins was at a high price, but this is Hawaii & a resort, so everything will be at a cost. The Plumeria restaurant was excellent, breakfast, lunch & dinner. All of it is worth the price since the food was consistently good. They also have Hoku (fine dining) and the Veranda, which is in the main area and on the balcony overlooking the pool & beach. They offered the kids menu in all locations, so my husband & I could eat a nice meal knowing the kids had an option. We really enjoyed the wine menu and all of the specialty drinks were great, if you are into enjoying a few libations on your trip.Our room was in the main tower 9th floor with a beach view, we also had the valet driveway underneath, but it was never loud, one thing I worried about for a good nights sleep. We had a nice sized room with 2 beds, the bathroom had a great tub, shower, 2 vanities & 2 closets. A great perk!It was busy at times with 1-2 weddings a day, but they usually were not there long, only to do the ceremony & take photos. I never saw an actually wedding party or dinner that was larger than 20 people and most of them were not guests so they didn't bother us. It was nice to see the beautiful brides and flowers. Our last night there was a huge company party, but we were able to enjoy their private fireworks display off the beach... it was like our own special farewell to an unforgettable family vacation.I hope that I am not leaving out any other details about this perfect paradise.The best part for us was being away from Waikiki, Kahala resort is its own secluded oasis. We did take the free shuttle into Waikiki a few times to do some shopping, some people watching and grab a burger at a local place. Overall, I think you really need to be aware that Kahala is off the beaten path, so if you have teenagers or are looking for a fun night life, then you should stay in Waikiki. We loved the simplicity of the private beach at Kahala, then having the ability to go into the main strip was an easy balance. The resort can be busy at times and maybe a bit hard on the wallet, but if you want the best vacation ever you need to realize there is a price. I can't say enough about how this place made our trip drama free! We were all happy everyday... it helps when you don't have crazy expectations and can just relax & enjoy the ocean.The website offers some great packages & deals, so many of the complaints/reviews can be remedied if you plan ahead. We did have the free breakfast for 2 adults, so instead of $100 every morning, it was only $30 for the 2 kids buffet.Also, the work out facility was nice, it is located on the main floor and overlooks the water. We also had alot of fun with the private paddleboard & surf lessons from Peter. He is the best!The concierge can set up many of the island tourist attractions like Pearl Harbor, snorkeling or whale watching. Hint: book your these activities before your trip or as soon as you get there since it fills up quickly. We were lucky to get tickets to Pearl Harbor after there was a no show.Overall, I can see our family staying here again & again until the kids grow alittle older and needs change.","Denver, Colorado","JetSetFam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",1,5.0

Their modest sushi restaurant was always fully booked. It is a beautiful property with calm surf, nice beach, very comfortable rooms. But the pool is smallish and mostly for families at play--not always a bad thing--but for relaxing adults, not so much. I believe the hotel management has a strong focus on drawing the wedding-on-the-beach crowd...the parade of photo-op brides and limos was a bit off-putting.

Amazing buffet breakfast. Beach was awesome, swimmable, beautiful. Pool was nice and warm. Staff was great and super nice. Room had really pretty view, nicely appointed, two big closets and two separate sinks which my wife and I loved. Shops were great.Food at the high end restaurant exceeded expectations - we expected over hyped food and were ready for disappointment. We followed waiter on recommendations and they were spot on. He guided us not to order too much as it would be plenty of food. Fun dolphins which our 4 year old loved to watch, great fish to watch feed, amazing sea turtles which brought lots of enjoyment.If I am trying to come up with any downside to the hotel.... the only thing on my wish list would be a bigger pool. At the same time, our 4 year old loved it and we loved the fact it was a super warm pool and not chilly.Waikiki is a short 15 minute cab ride. Babysitters on call were awesome.Truly, we were braced for something to go wrong given the last minute nature of the booking and being suspicious of Oahu versus the other islands. We were dead wrong.

But the breakfast buffet is superb!!Staff is superfriendly and helpful-only exception the concierge (had a few snafus with them, but after complaining to management they more than made up for it and did everything they could to make my stay extra-special - which is the sign of a well-run hotel - snafus can happen, but how it's dealt with is what makes the difference - and management here definitely gets 5 Stars!! A disaster is the Hertz rental on the premises - rude, sloppy and unreliable (didn' even fill up the gas fully and still tried to charge me for it, the car had not been cleaned, but they threatened a $200 cleaning fee, if it wasn't returned pristine.....the worst car rental ever!!So look no further, there is nothing better and more beautiful than the Kahala in Hawaii - the locals also LOVE and recommend this hotel!!","Santa Monica, California, United States","gg345271</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Monica, California, United States</strong>",0,5.0

We were there with her company for a special event. She had company meetings for two days and the rest was open. We never ate dinner at the hotel since we felt the prices were just too high, I had breakfast once and never again. I understand the cost of putting on a buffet breakfast and have paid in the high $20 dollar range in the past. I just thought $38 was absurd. I was also planning on doing work a few times during the trip but it took the hotel 3 days until they solved the problem of getting my computer and IPAD hooked up. They kept saying everything is ok, then on the third night like magic it started to work. I sensed they had a problem, too bad they just didn’t admit the problem. This hotel is an adult hotel. simple pool and beach, great place for adults and order kids. I have stayed at nicer hotels on other islands and never paid what I paid for parking and other amenities here. I am not the fan of resort charges, always pay attention. Would I go back if I wanted a hotel on Oahu, no, I would choose another hotel. I have to give this hotel on thing, the rooms were outstanding.

We had opted for a partial sea view and were given a room on the top floor, facing the mountains. If we went out onto the balcony, and leaned over, you got a bit of an ocean view. My husband is scared of heights and could not go out there to enjoy the view. We asked to be moved to a lower floor. We were given the choice of a lower floor for the same pricer or a full sea view also on a lower floor but at an extra cost, but kindly reduced by one of the managers, both available the following day. We chose to pay extra for the sea view, which we had loved on our first visit, and it was wonderful, so much better than looking at the mountains.

I thought of writing this review when I returned home, but I just could not wait. I have been traveling for many years and would say that I am a bit finicky, but I was absolutely blown away at the service they provided us and the hospitality received. My positive experience began weeks before I even arrived. I had some issues with my booking and management was able to take care of any concerns I had even before I arrived. The management is superb and you can tell the staff has been managed well. From the minute you arrived, the warm and sincere welcome you receive is just unbelievable. i honestly felt like royalty. My bell hop Trevor was so enthusiastic. He showed me the amenities and facilities including my room as if he had built the resort. The rooms are beautiful and so spacious and amazingly clean. The beds was like sleeping on clouds and I felt like I was sleeping in my own bed. The turn down service was awesome, coming home each night to hawaiian music playing in your room and bottles of water by your bedside. The waiters at the restaurant again wonderful. When my daughter was upset returning from the buffet claiming they were out of their famous sticky buns, ""must try"", Eric our waiter who was cleaning the next table and overheard, went and brought my daughter some. i was so shocked at how attentive the staff was. The beachside attendants set up the loungers for you even laying out your beach towels. The front desk who when you ask for wake up call, asks if you require a reminder call in ten minutes or if you want to know the full weather for the day. The room service who not just delivers the food on a tray like most resorts, but wheels in a table with places settings even if you just ordered a simple burger. The list goes on. They truly go above and beyond the industry norm for service.mHonestly, I have never experienced such hospitality and service anywhere. There may have been newer resorts, but the service here is so genuine and sincere. The staff are really happy and as a result you see that everywhere you go at the resort. I did not once run into any staff member who did not greet me or have a smile all week. Truly amazing resort and this is the one and only resort that I will come back without a doubt!!! Private beach, dolphin lagoon with sea turtles right at the resort, wonderful restaurants with excellent food, free shuttles, valet service. This resort has everything you want for a perfect vacation. This was the best decision for my family to stay away from the tourist Waikiki area where everyone normally stays and truly experience Hawaii and the Hawaiian hospitality.

After reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, we had high expectations given the amount we were spending. While we were very happy with the location (what a beautiful and calming neighborhood), overall we felt that the Kahala was not such a good value when compared to its peer hotels (Four Seasons Manele Bay comes to mind), and that in particular there were service gaps that one should not be experiencing when spending many hundreds of dollars per day. Before I cover the service gaps, I do want to thank the front desk manager (Tobias) for patiently listening to our feedback and for immediately acting on it by delivering some goodies to our room and comping a small portion of our bill. Tobias is an excellent listener and someone who the Kahala should be very proud to have as an employee. Also, while we had massages scheduled during our stay, there was construction noise next to the spa, so the spa staff kindly offered to do in-room treatments at no additional cost, which was very considerate. The massage therapists were excellent and provided some of the best massages we're ever had! Our complimentary room upgrade (courtesy of my AMEX Platinum card) was honored at check-in, and our subsequent request for a partial ocean view room upgrade was honored at a nominal fee (nice gesture), as well as the complimentary breakfast and $100 spa credit. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and many items were labelled ""GF"" (gluten free), which we really appreciated. Service at breakfast was quite good most of the time.The grounds are immaculate and quite beautiful, security is ever-present but low-key, and the dolphins are amazing to watch.Finally, we had an early flight our last day, so the front desk kindly suggested that we order breakfast via room service and provided us with an ample credit to cover most of the expense.The service gaps included: nothing in the room to celebrate our anniversary despite being asked (when I reconfirmed our reservation the day before we arrived) by one of the MODs whether we were celebrating a special occasion (what we felt was the biggest fail); no call-back from Housekeeping after we reported a missing shirt from the room we moved from; slow service one day at breakfast; Housekeeping not cleaning a dust-laden fan before installing it in our room; a malfunctioning phone which was not fixed during our 4 night stay (the button for the car valet stopped working 2 days into our stay and Housekeeping did not follow up). While these are not major fails, for the amount we were spending, we kept asking ourselves ""would this be happening at the Four Seasons Manele Bay""?Also, the ""partial ocean"" rooms actually face inland and have but a sliver of an ocean view so if you want a true ocean view, be prepared to pay a pretty penny for it. We would definitely consider returning to the Kahala if the service levels are raised to meet/exceed those of the Four Seasons to provide better value.","Los Altos, California","Travellingbug07</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Altos, California</strong>",33,4.0

Physically of course the property is still as immaculate as ever and more importantly the staff are as wonderful as they ever were.Arrival was a little different this time as the airline (no names) decided not to leave my bags in Hawaii this time around, however they did find them and return them to me the morning after my arrival.At check in this provided another opportunity for hotel staff to show their warmth, kindness and hospitality. The moment it was learned my bags were missing, Tobias (Front office Manager) assured me he could provide anything I might need in the short term, and Carolynn offered to provide items from her home. My room of course was ready and as anticipated and expected, in perfect condition. Without a doubt this is the most peaceful and attractive location on the island and the beauty of the location is more than equalled by the unending efforts expended by every member of staff you will come in contact with to ensure that your stay is as it should be.

Each restaurant does what it sets out to do and succeeds admirably, from casual on the beach to the slightly more formal Plumeria to the more formal Dining in Hokus, rest assured wherever you eat you will not be disappointed in either the food or the service. For a light and refreshing break in the afternoon, tea in the Veranda is the perfect spot. As for the staff, in many instances more like friends than employees. I have been fortunate enough to reside at many fine hotels in my life and nowhere are the staff more kind, friendly, helpful and courteous than at the Kahala. As some of my 'friends' retire it is most gratifying to see how quickly the newer and younger members become part of the magic that is the Kahala.Individual kudos and appreciation, the list is way too long to include everyone but I must mention a few with no slight intended to the ones I don't list!Wakako, where it all starts, Two really special ladies, Angelie and Saori in the spa (the number 1 rated spa in Hawaii by the way) Jaimie,Julie,Joy and everyone in the Plumeria,Carolynn,Noel and the ladies on the check in desk, Tobias of course and the lovely Flora who took time out of her busy schedule to chat for a pleasant half hour.

I agree that Waikiki is way too touristy to be there all of the time. In fact, if I had to stay in Waikiki, I would not enjoy Oahu at all.Thankfully, The Kahala solves the problem. It is located in a high-end, residential neighborhood and when you are at The Kahala, you do not know there's anyone else in the world. It is private, safe, and has everything you need right there. Yet, you can be in the center of Waikiki or Honolulu in 10 minutes to enjoy the very nice restaurants and shopping in those areas.The Kahala is 50 years old so it's not like staying at a place like Aria in Las Vegas. To follow the Vegas analogy, though, it's very much like staying at Paris in Las Vegas. It's clean and it's quaint. It reminds me of what the resort from the original Dirty Dancing movie is like, but the beach version, in that it's the kind of place that you want to go back to over and over again because it feels like ""home"".Expect to see a wedding on the grounds everyday you are there, because it really happens. Apparently, it's a big wedding destination for Japan. The dolphins and fish are beautiful and add to the flavor of the place. The staff calls you by name, and the views can't be beat.The beach is so peaceful because there is a reef about 50 yards out that stops the waves from breaking on the beach. You can see the waves, but the water in front of you is as still as a pond.Don't leave this place without renting a cabana and getting the chance to raise your flag. You will have a cold beverage in your hand in your cabana 5 minutes later. Seriously, this alone is worth the price of admission.In summary, my wife and I love this place and wish we could just live there. Because of The Kahala, we love Oahu, and have be all over that island as a result. Don't be mislead into thinking all of the beauty of Hawaii is on the other islands. There's not a more scenic place in the world than Makapuu Park on the southeast coast or Ke'ena Park on the northwest coast, and I could sit on the North Shore and watch the waves forever.If I were smart, I would give The Kahala an awful review so that demand does not drive up its prices, but if you have a chance to go to Hawaii and stay at The Kahala, you will never forget it.","Abingdon, Virginia","VTEsq</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Abingdon, Virginia</strong>",3,5.0

Within the hotel grounds the beach is also beautiful, and the pool is not huge but very comfortable for the crowd: we never felt it was too packed for an entire week. The service is great: they always address you by name when you call the front desk. The breakfast buffet was excellent and for our package included for up to two adults per room. Wifi was free. We did not do the Dolphin Quest swim, but we saw the dolphins playing plenty of times just standing on the fence of the pool. Hoku's restaurant was excellent.Things to be aware of: the beach has no waves, since it is a tide pool (as is much of Waikiki) and the outer barrier blocks the waves coming in. Nice for swimming, but not if you're looking for body surfing. (The beach park right next door might not be a tide pool.) Also, if you have a car, it is almost required that you valet park it. I think there is self parking option but the cost per day is about the same. There is no street parking as the resort is surrounded by a private golf course and private club.We had a very nice stay and would definitely consider going back again.",USA,"Jim H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",6,5.0

And through the on line booking tool, visitors can easily ensure they can exactly the room they want and at the rate the visitor wants to pay. I always book the ocean facing rooms/suites and love the sun light and wave sounds. The yellow walls and white bedding create a true area of relaxation. The king size bed is super luxurious. An elegant ceiling fan allows one just the right amount of island air circulation. The large bath with separate shower and tub are spacious and I enjoy the additional drawers and shelving space in the bathrooms. The robes and slippers are nice to use during your stay. I was surprised by the rather large amount of children at the resort in mid-March. (Parents, please do not allow your children to run up and down the halls at any time of the day yelling to their heart's content. Many guests try to enjoy peace and quiet in their rooms,) I was watching several of the Academy Award nominated films as I waited for the winds to calm down a bit.High winds thwarted our beach visit this week. If you are beach walkers, wear shoes as the hotel's beach is rather short, but a walk can easily be extended around the area, if one wears flip flops or sneakers.While not the most accommodating staff, the room attendants are pure delights. They are always so helpful and want to make sure everything in your room is perfect. I did not have the chance to visit the spa on this most recent trip, but I have had some of the most amazing massages at the Kahala Spa. Highly recommend the Spa and the massage services offered. I did want to mention that the Bell Staff is usually helpful. Our front desk reception and check in was handled very professionally by Ralph. We did request an additional room up check in, and I think we may have thrown him a curve ball, but he handled the requests like a pro. The food available around the pool and on the beach is typical beach fare. Fish tacos, ask for a corn tortilla or you will receive a flour tortilla. The nachos are pretty good, but ask for a side of guacamole and pico de gallo. The hot dog is served on a long roll, not a bun, so be prepared.In my room, 409, I could hear a guest in another room taking a bath and each time another guest in a close by room closed their door, I thought it was very loud. The sounds outside the room were very much a part of my room. Not mentioning the kids running up and down the halls, ringing door bells and using their outdoor voices. Perhaps some sound dampening measures can be taken.I like that the Kahala is not on Waikiki, but if it is morphing into a year round family destination and children will be running around as if they are at a Disney resort or a Marriott, i may have to return to the Halekulani.",California,"DinLBC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",73,4.0

But the service is what gets you - warm, genuine, going out of their way to make your experience special, from the room, to the food, to the careful advice about your daily choices for fun and relaxation. I'm a frequent visitor to hawaii and used to stay at other hotels to save a little money. I found the extra I spend on the Kahala is repaid to me 100 times in added experience, relaxation, and feeling pampered before it's time to go home. I also like the location a short distance from Waikiki, but not so far that you can't go in for dinner or shopping.Coming here as a single woman, I feel completely cared for by the staff -they look out for you. The concierge and bell desk help with recommendations and directions. The restaurant staff and the beach/ pool staff are plentiful and look for ways to serve you. This is not one of those places where you need to flag down someone or where the staff do not make eye contact - EVERYONE across all levels seems to really care. The beach is uncrowded and gorgeous. The breakfast buffet is scrumptious, with healthy choices, fresh omelets, and fresh fruits, large selection of homemade jams and baked goods. The staff are warm and catering even when the place is packed, as it was on weekends ..... the buffet was the highlight of every morning. I can't wait to go back. The Kahala spa was out of this world. Beautiful spa rooms, luxurious treatment, knowledgable about their products and delivered a customized massage with lots of aloha..... unbelievably serene and relaxing. I highly recommend the Alii Detox massage, which really helped me relax and recover from a cold and sore muscles from a hike the day before.

When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted outside by friendly staff. The lobby of the hotel was lovely and had many nice seating areas. Our room was nicely decorated and had a beautiful view of the ocean. The bathroom was spacious and had his and hers sinks as well as a closet for both of us, which included slippers and robes. Going out to pool was an amazing experience because the Kahala has a lagoon with dolphins ! It was so fun to watch them everyday just playing. The pool area has a bar that has a limited food menu as well. The bar has seating on the beach as well . We tried several of the restaurants and found them all to be excellent. The breakfast buffet at the Plumeria had a great selections of foods daily as well as an omelet station. Hoku's Restaurant was amazing as well. We both had spa treatments while there and had great service. The hotel offers rentals by the pool if you choose to paddle board or snorkle.

We were there for five nights right after New Year's. The staff is superb - super friendly. The location is great as you are well away from the density of Waikiki. (in my mind there are really only two hotels to consider in Honolulu - either the Halekulani in Waikiki or the Kahala Hotel - but you pay for the service and luxury). Unfortunately the Kahala Hotel does not seem to be quite the luxurious experience it used to be. The rooms are a bit dated and the attention to detail is lacking. For example, bottled water is only sparingly offered in the rooms. They only have single sinks in the bathrooms -not a big deal, but not what you expect in a ""five-star"" hotel. While we had a room on the 10th floor with ocean view, the lanai was not particularly clean and I was uncomfortable going out in my bare feet. The dining room for breakfast (the Plumeria Beach House) is beautifully situated, but it is a challenge negotiating the enormous breakfast buffet which is their standard fare. It is far from a unique experience and we found the crowd for breakfast to be uncomfortable - there seemed to be some large tour groups there while we were there. We also had dinner at Hoku's which was ok, but not particularly memorable. You pay a lot for this hotel and, while it is nice to be away from Waikiki, the Halekulani provides a more memorable experience. As a final note, while I understand the dolphins are well cared for and have full time attention, it is bizarre to see people in the pools with them, holding on to them to have pictures taken. They are beautiful creatures and it is strange to see them cooped up in the rather small pools. And having people in there swimming with them when they are supposed to be wild creatures.","Palo Alto, California","kentfield</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palo Alto, California</strong>",41,4.0

We were having brunch at the Plumeria Beach House yesterday morning when we suddenly thought, why not stay the night? My daughter wanted to use the pool. :) Overall, still love the hotel and the staff are mostly awesome. With ONE exception (and this was the same even with our previous stays)....why is the front desk/reception staff find it sooooo hard to crack a smile? Why is answering a question such a hassle? I also had the feeling that one of them didn't want me to book a room. I walked up from the Plumeria Beach House and asked a lady in the front desk if there is a room available (I was doubting it due to the Sony Open). The first lady said there was only ONE room available and it was an undesirable room on the first floor with a view of the front of the hotel (where people drive in). I told her I will ask my family first. When we decided to go for it, I went back to the front desk to book the room but found another lady available to help me. I asked the same question and she said there was a room on the fourth floor with a nice view of the golf course/mountains. So was the first one lying? I took the fourth floor room but when the second lady was processing the transaction (by the way, the whole time, NOT a single smile or friendly small talk), I had a quick question. She actually had the gall to say, ""wait I don't know where I am now,"" while staring at the computer screen the entire time. Maybe I should not have bothered her while doing rocket science work of booking a room - my apologies! But talking to me like that was RUDE!!! Rude!!!!! I don't want to end this review on a bad note so I must say that the valet service folks were exceptionally nice as well as the guy who delivered our bags to our room. Room was super clean, very big with an awesome view of the Sony Open! Housekeeping staff was also super, super nice.Dear Kahala --- we live in the neighborhood but check in for staycations and have also celebrated milestones there (our wedding, our eldest's baptism & first bday party). We also plan to have our second baby's second bday party there. Please train your frontdesk to more polite and to show a little bit more Aloha. It's such a shame when one of the first people you encounter upon checking-in seem as though the last thing they want to do is help/serve you.

Up close you see that everything is in immaculate shape. Every inch is freshly painted and clean and there is a real classic feel. FOOD:(my priority)Food was great, breakfast standard buffet but perfectly fine, except that the wait for a table was 15min once or twice, admittedly on the two busiest days of the year. Poolside drinks fantastic, reasonable range of poolside food for lunches. Dinner options good, the bar outside the main restaurant had great drinks, very sophisticated ambience with a superb musician and sleekly attired staff, good wines. Hoku was a fine restaurant, great wine list, and priced OK if I remember rightly.POOL/BEACHESThe pool is pretty small and generally too warm although it cooled down after a couple of days. The kids loved it. I was a bit surprised at how kid-friendly it was as a few people had suggested the Kahala was a more adult-oriented resort...in fact I find it hard to imagine Hollywood celebrities hanging out by the pool which is a pretty noisy hive of activity..lots of great pool toys in the pool or for sale for the children.Beach was stunning, the staff set you up with a deckchair or pod chair, the beach here is totally calm and perfect for canoeing. You can get more privacy here if you want. We were at ground level so could walk out onto the sand within a minute. Beautiful night sky and stars.SERVICEImpeccable, friendly, service, coming from Australia especially you really appreciate people just going out of their way to make sure you are completely happy. Can't praise this highly enough.SLEEPNo noise issues of any kind that I recall (except for New Year's Eve fireworks)OTHER15 minutes to Honolulu can't be beat...we had dinner at Nobu and then popped back to our ""private"" beach, what a setup!NEGATIVESWell none to do with the hotel at all, but as you may know the hotel is built around a lagoon housing dolphins. I feel strongly (even more so since my stay) that these animals should not be kept in captivity. They are obviously cared for to the highest standards but this sort of attraction will hopefully be a thing of the past soon. I still give the hotel 5 stars as this is a personal opinion only.","Melbourne, Australia","FredHayek</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",14,5.0

I had never stayed at The Kahala Hotel & Resort before, however I had always heard about how relaxing the resort is from friends and family. The fact alone that it is only a 10 minute drive away from Waikiki however is completely surrounded by a golf course is the best of both worlds, the city life and the traditional Hawaiian vacation. Two of my friends from our travel group were really interested in the famous shopping and activities in Waikiki, while the rest of the group just wanted to sit by the isolated beach and get a tan...The Kahala was the ideal resort for this type of situation. At night after we all went out and did our own activities, either on property (The Kahala Spa is one of my new favorite places, because of the private rooms with their own infinity spa tubs...their Lomilomi massage is better than Four Seasons resorts in Hawaii) or in the city, we would eat on property. We stayed for a week, so we were able to try out their various restaurants including their newly renovated The Veranda. The waitress showed us pictures of what The Veranda looked like before, so if you have stayed at The Kahala previously you should try and look online and seriously consider going back, because I think the hotel is always developing to extend the beauty of the property. The entire feel is outrageous, with the open room just next to the lobby, offering a delicious and wide new dinner menu and after dinner drinks menu. We ended up loving this so much we would get drinks there before walking just across the room to Hoku's, their upscale island restaurant. The service across the hotel really was what made our stay over the top, with every staff member ready and willing to please our group. If I could go back again this year I would. If you are looking for a Leading Hotel of the World in Oahu with a large standard room, you need to look on The Kahala's website and really consider about how much this hotel has to offer, not only for a group of friends but for families and couples too (They offer dolphin quest and private dinners.) The property also offers great rates depending upon the season- so make sure to check out their rate promotions on their website. I ended up getting this great deal for their ""Spring Package"" that gives 20% off on the room price with daily free breakfast buffet for 2 people.","Geneva, Switzerland","Olivia_Garwood</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",4,5.0

Customer service is extraordinary (as to be expected), and the restaurants and paddelboard/canoe rentals are great. In high season, the cheapest rooms start around $700/nt, going up to the thousands for the multiple bedroom suites, which are fabulous for families or luxury travelers. If you want to be in the middle of the action on Waikiki, stay at Halekulani or Royal Hawaiian (we've been to both and they're great), but if you want a little more quiet, Kahala is the place to go.","San Francisco, California","thestyledoctor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",206,5.0

We had dinner at the hotel and it seemed like a blast. The restaurant is truly a gem but the rooms and hotel do hold something to desire. I think it can be said it needs an update. Room was spacious but the views are stinky. We tried to get a room with a partial ocean view but the partial was left to the imagination from the balcony. We then moved to upgrade at $175 additionally each night only to find the parking lot view was worse. We went back to our keyhole view of the ocean. Room was pretty, colonial in style and old in my opinion and the interior and lower level is all dated. Service is good and the outside bar is pleasant. Frankly most of Honolulu needs the same type of face lift and any hotel taking the first step will get the benefit the investment deserves.

It was a serious let down.The GoodLocation is great – away from the noise of Waikiki. The beach is lovely, nice sand and great swimming conditions.The Dolphins are wonderful and the Dolphin Quest team is very friendly and helpful.Service at Hoku’s was excellent. The food was of a good standard - not great, but better than the rest of the resort food.The BadThe cabanas. Normally you can rent for an hour but over the holiday period you have to take for the whole day. The second cabana we booked took over an hour to deliver and they are like mini torture chambers – very hard and not long enough to hold a standard person.The rooms – while large they are poorly laid out and you have to perform a contortion act to get into the tiny toilet cubicle which seems smaller than an aircraft toilet room.The food and service at Plumeria for an evening meal was ghastly.The beds are not comfortable.The UglyAs previous reviewers have mentioned not getting the bedding configuration you booked and how the front desk staff handle this. We too booked back in August and ended up with the two single beds instead of a King size bed. An argument ensued at check in which was not handled at all well by the check in staff who seemed to blame us for not knowing that this was their policy. It is ridiculous when you are paying $1000 per night that this is “on request”. Imagine the plight of a honeymoon couple booking a king size room and ending up with two single beds! Beyond a joke.The breakfast situation is the worst we have experienced at any hotel. Based on the reviews we tried booking a time for breakfast, but even that didn’t work – we were kept waiting almost 45 minutes after our reservation time for a table. First you queue to register then you queue to wait for a table – there is no waiting area so you are left standing the entire time. The frustrating part is that there is no reason for this – there are plenty of empty tables, it is just very poorly managed.To sum up, the resort has huge potential but it is very poorly managed.","Auckland, New Zealand","Kiwi75</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",219,3.0

I would like to offer a different perspective. First thing to consider is that this is a very expensive property. Rooms cost more than $750 a night in peak season, breakfast not included.Second is that demand is so strong for Hawaiian hotels - 2012 will an all-time record year for visitations - that the hotels in Waikiki/Honoloulu don't have to try for business, it just walks through the door. The knock-on effect is that some staff, especially at the Kahala's front desk, are good at saying ""Aloha"" and ""Mahalo"" but out of their depth when there's a genuine issue.I would argue that they are blind to the basic needs and expectations of customers, such as that you'll get the room you have paid for. In our case that was a garden view room with two double beds. Check-in was from 3pm but our family of four - including two teenagers - was not given a room key until 40 minutes later. No staff member approached us during this time to offer hospitality of any kind - drinks, snacks whatever. In Asia, at this kind of rate, we would have been fawned over. Anyway, I got the key and checked out the room which had a double king bed and nothing else in it. In other words it was not the room we had booked. I returned to the front desk and dealt with another receptionist, told her brusquely we had the wrong room, please fix it. She is a little taken aback and informs me that there is no guarantee at the Kahala you will get the room you have booked. She says it's not a firm booking we have made but a ""request"" for two double beds in the same room.I check the fine print and she is right. Two double beds is classified as a ""service request"". There is no guarantee we will get what we paid $2,290.64 over three nights for. We made the booking and paid 75% in August, the balance in October.No-one from the property has contacted during this time to advise that the room we had booked, requested or whatever would not be available. So, our expectation was that it would be.Anyway, I get angry, we've been waiting forever, paid $750 a night for truly awful service, drop the f-bomb as in just ""f_______ fix it"" and walk away. We wait another 20 or 30 minutes, again no one offers any kind of hospitality, until my wife approaches the front desk and told ""great news, we have a room for you"".I take a look and there are two large single beds, a chaise lounge and a rollaway bed to accommodate our family. Again, not what we had asked for - or so we thought. At least give us another rollaway bed and get rid of the chaise, which had no bedding.We are later informed that we have in fact been given two double beds. Huh? They look so small. We measure and find they are 1.4m wide, big enough for a couple of honeymooning midgets but not much else. I've just checked with Wikipedia and the official US double bed measurement is 1.9m - 500mm larger than what the Kahala is calling a double bed.But I digress. We are still upset at the lack of hospitality we have received and ask for breakfast to be included and instead get into an argument with the receptionist who does nothing at all to defuse the situation. Instead, she further inflames matters by blaming us.At no stage over the preceding 90 minutes has any staff acknowledged that a series of errors from the hotel has brought us to this point. We have been offered zero hospitality. Somehow they think it is all our fault.The customer service director is brought in one assumes to calm matters. Instead she adds fuel to the fire. Another staff member joins in and adds another voice to the argument, the hotel's voice of course.By now the volume is up. Loud but not shouting. Again, I repeat, no effort has been made to defuse the situation. In fact, the customer service director says something like ""ok that's it, I am calling security"" with the implied threat we are getting kicked out of the hotel.For what? Sticking up for ourselves? Raising our voices in an argument that is 90% down to the Kahala not fulfilling its obligations - not one of them - as an elite hotel charging $750 a night.Who knows. The fact is that Honolulu./Waikiki is totally told out. It is two days before New Year's Eve and there is literally nowhere for us to go. Somehow we get the keys back, go to the room and try to calm down.My wife, who worked as a flight attendant at Qantas for 14 years, is incredibly upset. The staff have been doing nothing but sticking up for themselves and their mistakes, then call security to sort it out.It's bizarre.I later speak with the front desk manager who was aware of the fracas at the time it was happening but did nothing to intervene. I ask him why did this occur and he once again offers the hotel's perspective, which is essentially that nothing is guaranteed.He does not acknowledge the lack of hospitality we received while waiting for the room (""we only say check-in is after 3pm, not at 3pm""), and also attempts to justify offering us a king room with a single bed for four people, the basic error that led to everything else.I ask him to make my wife happy. He sends up a bottle of domestic sparkling wine and a note that offers no apology just the message: ""We hope you are feeling better"".He offers also breakfast as token but, not as it turns out, for all of us. Just two people from our family of four get breakfast on the house, everyone else must pay.As for the hotel and infrastructure, it's quite nice but nothing special. Great location, small pool, crowded, decent beach. Guests - lot of Japanese and a mix of other nationalities.Breakfast buffet is average, the food at Plumeria good, as is the wine list.For these reasons I will give the property two stars. If this was only on service, the Kahala would get nothing.In summary, front desk staff are poorly trained and have no idea of genuine hospitality or how to deal with a guest with a justifiable complaint. A bit of customer service 101 would have nipped this whole thing in the bud.Of course, that did not happen.In fact it was the customer service director who called security rather than making her guests feel special.It's so ridiculous, you just have to laugh.",Sydney,"TruMarc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",45,2.0

For the most part, our December trip met or exceeded our expectations. The rooms are magnificent and the views from our fourth floor mounain side room were great. We enjoy the retro design of the hotel along with the modern interiors. If smoking was allowed and people dressed more formally these days you could imagine that you were in a Mad Men episode. The pool and the beach were perfect places to relax when it wasn't windy or rainy. I thought the breakfast buffet at plumeria was a good value, especially if you can eat late enough to make it more of a brunch that will get you to dinner. We also had a wonderful dinner at Hoku. We had two criticisms. As with our prior trip, the service at the pool and beach, as well as the lobby bar, can be spotty. There are some very good folks working outside, to be sure, but some of them are slow. A couple of the waitresses at the Vernanda seemed downright unfriendly. When I asked one of the waitresses about my bill--I thought I was being billed twice for the same drinks--she told me that she was sure she hadn't made a mistake and she ""had not been drinking."" Again, there were a couple of very good waitresses at Veranda, but a couple of them are probably in the wrong line of work. I will say that the food at Veranda as well as outside is excellent, especially the nachos and burgers. And the drinks were very good as well. The other criticism I share with some of the other reviewers is that the seafood buffett was a real disappointment, especially given the price. I expected overflowing amounts of fish, clams, lobsters, oysters, etc. The food at this buffett did not meet expectations.All of that said, it was a wonderful trip. We love the class, charactor, and elegance of the Kahala and will go back.

Things have never been better at this classy and elegant resort a few miles from Waikiki.I used to tell people the service at Kahala suffered from a slight air of haughtiness that always tainted our stay. That is GONE...nothing but sincere and friendly smiles to make sure your stay is as pleasurable as possible. The outside hotel structure which epitomizes some of the more outdated ideas of building design from the 60's gives no hint to the elegance you will encounter within.From the drive-up and efficient (and free!) valet service, prompt and courteous counter check-in, you are ushered to your room with luggage and given explanations about the resort. We had a seamless experience. There was never any hint of an expected tip (although of course we did).The spacious rooms have been slightly updated to be more modern with a cool palette rather than the traditional mix of Polynesian and Boston colonial furniture (the traditional Hawaiian mix since missionary days) they used to have. The room was impeccably and absolutely clean. Everything was in perfect order. Internet service was complimentary. The bathrooms remain unchanged with two sinks, two closets, separate shower and bath and a huge array of lotions and complimentary supplies. If you pick up the phone, they know your name. Housekeeping and turn down service was discreet.Their main hotel restaurant, The Plumeria Beach House (aka Plumeria Cafe) which borders their beautiful, private sandy beach has been reverted back to a tropical garden theme, and service and food is friendly, effiicient, carefully prepared..and delicious. Choose to sit on the patio if it is a nice day. The breakfast buffet is back to its top-notch offering; of course at $31/person now, the price is top-notch too (we were offered and accepted a price break of 50% for two including tip and taxes if we pre-paid at the time of our reservation). High quality ingredients and careful preparation. This is easily one of our favorite eating spots in Hawaii.I'm sure others will say they prefer the Halekulani and that their very reason for being on Oahu is to enjoy and be a part of the hustle-and-bustle of urban Waikiki and if that is why then certainly stay there, but if you want to enjoy the amenities of Honolulu and Oahu without being directly in Waikiki, the Kahala is an oasis of peace and gracious living that I highly recommend.","Honolulu, Hawaii","ScottN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",202,5.0

I remembered the quiet, elegant service, the beautiful settings, the amazing view and the delicious food. May it be brunch with my folks, birthday celebrations or weddings, we all left delighted and extremely happy. This property has been THE HOTEL in Honolulu; its name would garner a bit of envy and praise. Unfortunately, the locals only speak of it with nostalgia; the Kahala hotel is a ""has been,"" with falling standard of service. The location of this hotel is excellent; adjoining the Waialae Country Club and with its own strip of beach. It is extremely private but with very easy access to Waikiki; furthermore, the small Kahala Mall is just a stone throw away. The lobby is still exactly as I remembered: grand and beautiful. It was exquisite to see the sun slowly resting over the horizon, to feel the trade wind gently circling and to smell the very impressive Christmas tree towering over the lobby.We had excellent reception by the valet; luggage were quickly retrieved and delivered to our room. The check in took a little longer than expected, but this allowed me to relive nostalgia. We had a room in the lagoon wing overlooking the country club. The living space is well appointed and the bed is extremely comfortable; in fact, it is quite large for Honolulu standard. However, the bathroom is in need of a major face lift. I don't know if this meant to be part of the ambiance, but cracks on the tile and cabinets and chips on the furniture seemed a bit out of place. Also, the Tommy Bahama brand toiletries are a bit odd; it doesn't fit the over feel of this hotel.As I walked down the corridor, I see the signature markings of this once Mandarin Oriental: there are beautiful pieces of furniture and Ming vase lamps. The tranquility and the soothing glows of the setting sun were simply amazing. Of course, this blessed evening was marred by the forgettable dinner at the Plumeria Restaurant.Plumeria is one of those nuisance flowers that grows everywhere on the island, and it rots quickly. This restaurant has very similar qualities: very common, over priced and understaffed. As reviewed by Glenn B, the buffet is $55 per person and the offering is very underwhelmed compared to other establishments in this buffet-rich city. There were large parties, and the food were gone quickly, but took quite a while to be replenished. The hostess and manager were in foul mood that night and servers were assigned too many tables to offer adequate service.An otherwise pleasant stay was scarred by misinformation given by the morning receptionist. We were to be stranded at the hotel and to miss our flight due to the start of the Honolulu Marathon. Our hearts skipped a bit, but we got out and arrived at the airport in plenty of time. So much for a pleasant lasting impression.We would stay here again for the location, and living quarter is quite good. The valet and bell hop are first rate. However, I can see why this hotel is not quite five star. The management has changed so frequently in the past that this once grand dame of Honolulu is having a bit of identity crisis. A grand lobby with chipped bathroom, Tommy Bahama theme toiletries, Denny-like food and service just don't harmonize.",washington,"panam747</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>washington</strong>",177,4.0

You can get more bang-for-your-buck on Oahu in Waikiki or Ko'Olina... but Kahala is away from the hustle-and-bustle of Waikiki, but close enough to the action for a short taxi ride away if that is your thing.Dolphin show is great for the kids, beach is nice, protected unless there is a big south swell. Average grounds- it's Hawaii, but I've seen better landscaping at similar class resorts.Did I say a great staff?The server at the lobby bar/lounge area open in the evening I found to be a little on the salty side, but by and large everyone else at this resort was great.As a local I've stayed at resorts on Maui, Big Island, Kauai and Oahu, and do so fairly regularly for work so I feel like I've got a good grasp of the market and what is available here.Stayed one night for a sunrise wedding on 12/12/12, and I don't think you could ask for a better staff to plan your wedding- Amy, the wedding planner, is VERY good, and for someone coming from the mainland, she will make your special day a true delight. Highly recommend her.Otherwise, it's all about the name at the Kahala- it's pretty much the top name resort you can stay at on Oahu, but that's more because of the location and heritage. (Kahala neighborhood is one of Hawaii's wealthiest)As other local reviewers have noted here, it's really not that special... there are better beaches, better sunsets, and better locations, but the Kahala has a special feel to it and has played host to a number of celebrities over the years, probably more because of it's seclusion yet proximity to town. (Check out the wall of celebrities- it seems like every A-list actor from Hollywood present or past has stayed here)Looking for 'The' name-brand high-end resort on Oahu? This is it. Looking for the best in value amenities, sunsets and beaches?

On a birthday they will give you a small cake with a candle.","Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","Glenn B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada</strong>",3,3.0

This trip we found some changes. They appeared to be cost saving measures, although the room prices are not reflective of the changes. You no longer get fresh leis but plastic type ones. For a luxury hotel, it seemed a bit on the cheap side. In the room, the toiletries were no longer the French ones that they used for years but Tommy Bahama. They were okay. My biggest complaint was there were no coffee cups in the rooms only paper ones. Really? An expensive, luxury hotel with only paper cups in the rooms for coffee. The breakfast buffet no longer allows you to get your own juice, you must ask for it. In addition, the selection of pastries and other items has been scaled back.We love the location and the spaciousness of the rooms. However, our bathroom tile was chipped and marred, again not indicative of a luxury hotel. We do love the beach here and the rooms but would hope they would do a bit more maintenance to be at the level of a luxury, pricey hotel.","concord, ca","Cavsp_12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>concord, ca</strong>",4,4.0

Prior to coming to The Kahala, we usually stayed at the hotels in Wakiki. Wakiki simply became too crowed and the beach is jammed packed; no longer a pleasure to spend a week, a day maybe. (take the Kahala shuttle to Wakiki Beach)Kahala is about 15 minutes east of Wakiki. Located at the end of Kahala Avenue (the most coveted address in Honolulu, I think), it is secluded with lovely surroundings. Without big waves and a gentle slope, swimming in the ocean is a pleasure. (only beach that I can swim without getting knocked about by waves) Best of all, i've never seen more than 10 swimmers at one time.Delicious buffet breakfast is pricey but if your vacation package includes, it is a fabulous treat especially if you go at 6:15 AM and watch the sunrise as you enjoy the freshly cooked omelette, incredible pastries and of course,fresh fruits.Downsides: the pool is dated, small, and less than five feet deep. This resort is not design for children, except very young ones. With the exception of dolphins, it is not a children friendly resort. It is designed for weddings, multiple weddings in one day. Parking is expensive and no street parking available.","Morgan Hill, California","Molly C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morgan Hill, California</strong>",54,5.0

We cannot speak highly enough of this hotel. It was our first time there and will certainly not be our last. Our accommodation was top notch, very spacious and the bathroom was excellent with his and her sinks at either end of the room, separate bath and large shower, fridge and safe, plenty of hanging space in the bathroom, again his and hers. We had a large balcony with partial view of the ocean (normally we prefer ocean front but the view we had was great with the golf course, mountains and homes at the back and the ocean to the side). The breakfasts were excellent although we only ever had the continental which gave us ample choice without needing any of the cooked options. Unfortunately we didn't get to try Hokus restaurant as I was unwell the night we had booked so had to cancel our reservation. We can both thoroughly recommend this hotel, the location is a little away from the downtown area but that suited us as it was really quiet and we had a rental car anyway. The actual pool area was a little small but the beach was just adjacent with very comfortable beds and full amenities so that's where we did our relaxing in the sun and swimming in the ocean. The dolphin attraction was wonderful, we didn't actually swim with them ourselves but watched others and did a lot of filming.

The hotel did offer a complementary shuttle, but we always opted for our own vehicle, so I cannot speak to the shuttle service.Our room was absolutely gorgeous on the top floor overlooking the ocean. I loved sleeping with the veranda doors open and never had an issue with bugs coming in. The room was large and mostly well-maintained. I really enjoyed the separate vanities in the bathroom, which made getting ready in the morning much easier for two people. The bedding was also extremely comfortable.Our rate also included breakfast. Wow! This had to be one of the best breakfast options that I've ever had as included! Fresh squeezed juices, omelets, pancakes and waffles and fresh fruit, yogurt, etc. There were enough options that I could have eaten there all day. I'd definitely recommend trying to get a breakfast-included rate though as it was quite expensive if you paid separately. There were also a few other dining options on property that we found to be good (food and service), but nothing over-the-top spectacular.The beach and pool areas were also very clean and beautiful. I especially love the privacy of the beach and the little island that juts out (makes for some great photos). We never had a problem with getting chairs, towels, etc.The service was also attentive. The front desk staff was very accommodating for a few special requests that we had such as check cashing, recommendations, etc. They also promptly took care of a problem with our original reservation.","Atlanta, Georgia","goferris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",119,5.0

We knew full well it was an expensive 'resort' from the start but we were not happy with a few things when staying here.PROS:The valet/bell boys out the front were great, friendly, and always had some cold water and a beach towel for us.The food at the Seaside grill was actually quite good even though it was a bit expensiveThe dolphins, swimming pool and beach were all really niceThe bed was comfy and amazingCONS:Everything costs extra - want an umbrella? Sit in the shaded bungalow? Borrow a pool toy? They all cost extra. Even when there were only a few people by the pool, staff still wanted to charge for the bungalows.The shuttle bus to Waikiki only starts at 10am and last pickup is 9:45pm. For such a large hotel, one bus per hour that holds 12 people is not sufficient. We would have spent over $300 in cab fares just to get to Waikiki and back during our 10 day stay. I'm sure you can afford a second shuttle bus that runs on the half hour and for longer hours?No information/out of date info: No-one told us to book the shuttle, we had to learn that the hard way by not being allowed on and having to pay for a cab. The info book in the room mentioned a sushi restaurant - after walking around trying to find it we learnt it had been shut down.WiFi was hit and miss, and we were only on the 1st floor.We were not allowed to have a late checkout on our last day, when were were doing a Pearl Harbour tour - forcing us to check out at 5:45am and leave our bags in storage. I know they were not that busy as to need the room straight away.No free breakfast - even the cheapest Holiday Inns have free breakfast, come on guys. There isn't even a microwave in the room either, just a small fridge.In short, unless all you want to do is sit by a pool or the beach, this is an expensive inconvenient hotel. We were on our honeymoon and apart from some champagne in the room on the first night, we felt that the service was not up to the price of our stay.","Adelaide, Australia","James M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",34,3.0

We booked 2 rooms @ Mountain Lanai overlooking the lush Waialae Golf course. Ocean-view will cost a lot more. We had stayed here a few times in the past. In its glory days, it was an exclusive enclave built by the late Baron Hilton where the Rich and Famous and Holloywood set gravitated. There is an impressive photo-ops and words written by past famous guests lining a wall, including Kings and Queens. The latest movie guest staying here was George Clooney when he was filming the movie 'The Descendants'.PRO:* Subliminal beach setting* Extremely private and relaxing. No cell phones heard at the beach.* Friendly staff * Staff Karen/Roger coordinated & arranged a seamless tennis day at the Waialae Country Club down the road.* Great customer service from Dianah (sp ?) at the Business Center & Randy at Plumeria restaurantCon:* Rooms are older, no rain showers or up-to-date stuff like phones & TV's in bathrooms* Better buffet spread and quality of towels and bed linen when the hotel was managed by Mandarin Oriental Hotel* For value rendered, would not pay rack rates, but special deals like stay 4-and-pay-3 with breakfasts included are value for the money. Must stay at a lanai room inorder to fully enjoy the super views* Free shuttle serive got booked up quickly when we were there. At high season, it would likely be hard to get by. On previous occasions, we rented a car or took taxi to Waikiki, Ala Moana and dinners.SUMMARYThis is more like a place to kick off your shoes and totally relax. I would not compare Kahala Hotel to the 4-Seasons or Mandarin Orientals except perhaps to the Oriental in Bangkok for its imbued history. When in Honolulu, we stay at either the Halekulani or Kahala. They are different. You're buying a particular kind experience with each.

So we left. (Turns out other reviewers on this site confirmed my suspicions.)Upon exiting my friend handed the ticket to the guy in the parking booth, and the guy said, “$35”. That’s it – just said, “$35”.So I said, “What?!?!”, and my friend asked, “How long were we here?”The answer: “1 hour”We were both in shock, and the guy said if we’d spent $25 in the hotel they would have validated the ticket, but there was no clear signage as we entered the parking lot that showed that!o.k. we decided not to argue the issue, and my friend handed the parking attendant his Visa card, and was told, “Cash only”.Friend didn’t have that much cash on him at the time – and luckily I’d put some cash in my wallet for the days outing; I don’t usually carry cash with me, but it’s a good thing I did that day!Hmmmm, I wonder what would have happened if we hadn’t had the 35 dollars in cash?All that said, I realize Honolulu is a very expensive city to visit, and typically parking garages/lots in big cities are very expensive – but 35 bucks for ONE HOUR?!! C’mon!!I realize, too, that we should have probably stopped to read the fine print on the sign before we pulled in to the hotel – but we didn’t. Actually, I’m not quite sure it was even posted; in hindsight we should have looked closer. But when I’m a passenger in a car, I don’t think of such things.Another reviewer wrote of a similar experience back in June of this year. Apparently the Kahala has started this parking fee policy since my friend had lasted visited, and he wasn’t aware of it.The grounds were nice – nothing particularly special – the Hilton Hawaiian Village is way more spectacular! The dolphins & turtles were cute, but I sure as heck don’t think seeing them was worth 35 bucks!Doing some research after our “$35 Kahala experience”, I learned that the Kahala Hotel & Resort is supposedly one of Honolulu’s more “classy” hotels, so they figure they can charge this outrageous parking fee for the casual visitor. Apparently they figure that’s the “price of admission for looking at 'classy'”. Personally, I think it’s ludicrous to have that kind of a minimum parking fee, and I will never, ever go back to that place again. I think their parking rate and policy sucks!So, I’m just writing this to warn others: BEWARE!! If you plan to visit the Kahala for a short visit, be prepared to pay for it.Final note: In view of the fact that I paid just $70 (with a discount coupon) to park my car in a parking lot near Phoenix Airport for the entire 8 DAYS I was in Honolulu, it makes the whole “$35 Kahala experience” seem even more ludicrous!","Glendale, Arizona","Cacata42</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glendale, Arizona</strong>",23,1.0

I would echo MikeK's review completely actually but would also like to add a few other points.To the good. The valets greeting you are exceptional. Always with a smile wishing you a good day and welcoming you back. They easily and freely gave directions, and recommendations for local attractions and eateries. Far more knowledgable than the concierge actually.Housekeeping was okay. They did an excellent job tidying up but timing always seemed to be off. Given we had a few days with a conference with set itineries I felt that the staff should be aware of when guests would be in room or out and make them up accordingly as well as turn down service. (they generally showed up at the door at 6pm for turndown as we were trying to get ready for evening events or activities on our own)The concierge was not very knowledgable about dinner recommendations, or general hotel policy truth be told. Without someone at the activities desk all the time or at guest services full time the logical next choice would be the concierge. Take my word for it and ask the Valets. Wifi in our room was spotty at best. Two days it was excellent. 7 days I had little luck staying connected. I had a much better connection on the beach. On our last two days I mentioned it to the concierge and our modem was replaced but it was placed on top of the garbage can. I would advise whomever placed it in the room that perhaps the desk above would have been a better location. The electrical plug in our bathroom was also faulty. If you fiddled with your curling iron just so you might get it to stay working. It was a gfi plug so I reset it assuming perhaps it had tripped. No...it was just poorly wired. Fortunately there was another mirror in the toilet room. There actually were very few plugs in the room at all. We had utilized all the plugs around the desk to charge phones, and ipads. I need a cpap so I had to unplug the light beside the bed if I wanted to charge my camera battery overnight and use my cpap.Overall the hotel was nice. It could use some updating. The rooms are very spacious. Our ""ocean view"" was hardly that. (Leaning off the edge of the balcony to see the ocean is not what I call an ocean view. ) Given we spent little time in the room and we were paying a conference rate that did not bother me too much but we also stayed an extra 6 nights in addition to the conference so one would hope that would have been taken into consideration when allocating rooms. If I had paid regular rates I would have been less than amused.We had no issues with the beach staff unlike the previous poster. $26 for an umbrella is a little pricey and I hate being nickel and dimed after checking in but we bit the bullet and learned not to rent an umbrella again. The wait staff in the restaurants were wonderful. The quiet beach delightful.There just seemed to be something lacking. Looking at their regular rates (not corporate conference rates) I would expect exceptional. Other 5 stars in that price range we've stayed in have been exceptional. Ritz Carlton, Fairmont, etc. It seems the Kahala is trying to catch up to the times living off it's former glory. I think it can be exceptional again. When paying top dollar for a hotel one expects not to have to worry about a broken coffee pot, electrical plug, modem. etc. I would stay again for under $325 a night but would not stay again over that rate.",Canada,"Frozenrose</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",70,3.0

This is the final stop on a three island vacation (with a work conference for 3 days) - I could not be more positive on all aspects of our stay at the Grand Hyatt in Kauai and at the Four Seasons in Kona -- 2 hotels that exceeded my expectation for beauty, fantastic service, exceptional food and stunning pool and ocean areas. As I read the reviews, maybe the hotel stills believes in its legacy as a leading hotel - but management should visit some of the higher ranked hotels to figure out what it will take to bring this place back to its legacy. More importantly, the service staff are not fitting for a top-notch hotel, for example: concierge staff had limited knowledge or willingness to help, even getting a couple of chairs set up by the pool seemed to be a hassle - while others in the hotel have been better, just not excellent. It is clearly time to revisit what the Kahala wants to be; either lower prices and be a four star, or make some substantial changes to compete with a Four Seasons or even Grand Hyatt.

We visited here for our Honeymoon in October. Mr Kalozois. The following review is 100% honest and not seeking anything from the hotel, for either good or bad comments. Room Type: Partial Ocean Lanai - $700 p/n including breakfast. Check-in:Lays on arrival. Extremely friendly staff, from bell staff to check in desk. 5/5 here. Rooms:Complimentary Brut for our honeymoon was appreciated. Unfortunately we found an empty water bottle underneath our dresser on arrival. Bath tap dripping. Strange tapping noise from air conditioning. Nice CD music - hawaiian music playing on arrival. Nice wicker fan adds to look of room. Great beds. Awfully large LCD screen bolted to wall, smaller LED tv would be expected in hotel of this standard. Expensive pay per view movies, and very limited non HD offerings on television.Very nice bath robes. Good selection of bathing products. Poor floor tiling in bathroom area. Broken thermostat in shower, didn't compromise use, but plastic handle easily came away from fixing. Excellent room service. Excellent housekeeping after initial bottle under dresser. Very very friendly housekeeper. Extra coffee left upon request. Nice view. Dining:Excellent buffet, but expensive if not included. Valued at $90+ per couple. Spotty service, good one day, not so great the next. Even when breakfast is included the bill is shoved under your nose immediately after sitting down. Our table was completely cleared when we went to get a plate of food together. Overly eager to get you out. One would expect sincere apology and a rush to get cutlery and drinks back to table. Not so, some ten minutes waiting for this. No apology, but laughs from the staff. Not impressed here. Hoku restaurant barman asked for ID from us even though we were in their system, we are 27 and 31 respectively. Not worried as is law, but expect they could check ages on system instead of embarrassing us in front of other guests. Very expensive, and cocktails so so. Better value in Waikiki beach. Service impeccable from waiting staff they received a very large cash tip, as we did not want bar staff to share. Complimentary water at various points within hotel. Overall dining could be improved but buffet at breakfast offered great choices and quality. Beach/ pool area:Exceptional service upon asking for towels and chair covers. Staff will set you up on the beach or by the pool without you asking and do so with a smile. I tipped $2 each time for this. Very happy with this service. Quiet beach area was appreciated. $25 charge for umbrella was steep, but considering the staff have to dig a hole and position it each time, is understandable. $100 for cabana was very steep and not necessary. Quality low. Not net curtains but canvas, and steel not wood. Small pool but not many using it so this was acceptable. Excellent service at pool side bar, very pleased here. Excellent staff. Prices reasonable. $15 for burger and fries. We were told that the hotel is non smoking so we paid extra for a partial ocean lanai which is smoking. We waited until in the room or went to designated smoking area to have a cigarette. Unfortunately double standards allowed guests to smoke on the beach as it is classed as public property. Upon complaining I was informed there was nothing that could be done. In terms of law, fair enough, but feel this double standard let the hotel down wildly. This upset me greatly. Additional services/ amenities:Shuttle service into town is booked up extremely quickly and no second run if overbooked. They would also take you out and leave you there if not return space is available forcing between $20-40 return taxi dependant on drop off point. Surprised at this.Dolphin lagoon is dreamlike. Early morning feeding was wonderful, impromptu show of jumping was spectacular and the trainers were friendly and informative about the dolphins and lagoon. Excellent addition to the hotel. $125 experience, seemed good value. Shops in hotel expensive, but cater for the type of clientelle expected.Limited evening activities, forces you into Waikiki too often. Overall:Service was exceptional. Let down by a few points of carelessness and double standards with smoking.We would stay again, but would hope these points of contention are ironed out before returning. Hotel manager and staff do their jobs very well, and cannot control everything, but one would hope the information filters to the people who can make a difference. Aloha!x",,Jkalo,5,3.0

There are more pools for fish, including giant turtles. It is paradise on earth. BUT, and it is a shame there are a few ""buts"" all is not perfect. Surely someone should have taken us to our room when we arrived and shown us how all the gadget there worked. Surely the mini-bar should have been stocked and,when I asked for beers, wine, etc., I should not have had to pay a service charge. The lavatory inside the gorgeous bathroom was too small - you had to wriggle to get inside the door. And, writing about lavatories, the ones by the main pool were a disgrace. Again tiny, and often smelly. Also, just one cubicle for men and one for women, certainly not enough for all the guests. The restaurants were not bad but not that good either. There were only two to choose from, again not enough for a large hotel like the Kahala. The bar between the pool and the sea was charming, however, and the service superb. I had not been to the Kahala for 31 years.

We had just spent a week in Maui, so to be fair,there is nothing that can compare to that. Oahu was a overly crowded, hectic place. If we had known what it was going to be like we would have enjoyed one more day in beautiful Maui. The Kahala is a beautiful hotel, but just not as beautiful for the $$$$ you fork out to stay there. We saw hotels that were better for less in different areas. We were supposed to have been allowed a ""honeymoon upgrade"", which was a joke. We actually ended up paying them even more money to see the ocean instead of the parking lot. I'm pretty sure if they could charge you for the air there, they would. The plus side of this hotel is the private beach... that was the best thing about staying here. If you have seen any of the other hotels in this area, they are very crowded.

I am only reviewing the hotel and not my experiences with the wedding (which was good overall). I have been to Honolulu 7 times & stayed in different hotels - mostly in Waikiki (Marriott, Hotel Renew, Pacific Beach, Ilikai, Aston Waikiki Beach Tower). I was pretty excited to finally stay there as my sister & her family live next door to the Kahala & we dined there frequently. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with my one night stay. # 1. check in took a very long time & there was some confusion at the reception. # 2. We had breakfast included as part of the room but they would not confirm that and argued that was not the case until they found the reservation. I was put on hold (on the telephone) for a long time until this was straightened out. # 3. we found the bed to be incredibly uncomfortable - we ended sleeping on the floor (the mattress is very, very soft - like sink in soft - in all fairness, if you like that type of mattress, I guess it would not be too bad but my husband and I both prefer firm mattresses). My parents were staying there for one week and they had the same issue with the mattress and had to have it replaced. As we were there for just one night, we didn't think it was worth complaining about. # 4. The service was average for Hawaii standards and not exemplary as expected in a hotel of this star rating/price. To be honest, I experienced more genuine Aloha in the hotels in Waikiki.The good of Kahala is of course the unmatched location right off the most beautiful part of the island away from all the craziness of Waikiki. View of the sunset from the beach is amazing. The room was large, clean and well decorated. It was nice to watch the dolphins from our balcony. We ordered room service for the wedding party and the food was quite yummy. Restaurants on site are all very good. Overall, I was disappointed with the value we received and I doubt we would stay here again. There are too many nicer hotels (& less expensive ones) to choose in Oahu. It seems like their rating on Tripadvisor has gone down in the last year or so - I remember they were #1 or # 2 on the list for a long time - maybe they need to consider making some changes to bring them up to the level they were at. They definitely have the potential to be an exemplary hotel.","Atlanta, Georgia","jeniusk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",10,3.0

We stayed here for 4 nights before going to Maui and maybe should have stayed here the entire time. Yes it was that good. Compared to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki this is an oasis. Waikiki reminds me of The Vegas Strip. Been there done that. Too crowded and commercialized. Maybe we are getting older but the calmness and serenity of The Kahala can't be surpassed. The beach is absolutely gorgeous and uncrowded. No trouble getting lounges by the pool or on the beach at any time of the day. The Mai Tai's are to die for. Our room was partial oceanview. Well this was the best. We had a view of the mountains, golf course and the ocean. We felt this was better than a oceanview room because we had all views in one room. The room was large, the bathroom to die for, and it was spotless. We sat out on the lanai every morning watching the sun come up. Doesn't get any better than that.Service was impeccable.

I would never normally write an online review, but following my stay at the amazing Kahala Hotel & Resort i feel compelled to give them the praise they rightly deserve! Our honeymoon consisted of a few nights in vegas and LA sandwiched with 9 nights at the Kahala. I understand this is not everyone's idea of a good honeymoon, but for us we are very active and while we enjoy an idilic beach we like having the option of lively restaurants/bars and plentiful activities nearby. The Kahala proved to be the perfect balance for us.Upon check in we were greeted with wonderful lei's, complimentary bottles of hawaiian mineral water and very friendly and helpful bell staff. As we made our way to the check in desk there was no que and a very helpful receptionist who explained the layout of the resort and informed us we had been given a complimentary room upgrade to the dolphin lagoon wing (i must admit, we had emailed the resort ahead and explained it was our honeymoon, and if they could do anything to make our experience even more memorable it would be much appreciated). Once we reached our room, we found a complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries! The room was a very nice size, with a huge bathroom (double sink, large waterfall type shower, large bath), a supremely comfortable queen bed and small sofa. Our room was also in a perfect position, at the end of the dolphin wing, which meant we were a short walk from the lobby, but a stones-throw from the beach. the room was overlooking the mountainside/golf course which was very nice. I have read other reviews complaining you get woken at 5:30am by the golf course being mowed, i heard it once and to be honest the only reason i heard it was i had woken early with jet lag - it was so insignificant i cant believe people actually commented on it! The complimentary resort wifi came in very handy for me and the wife making friends and family jealous with pictures and facetime calls!The beach at the kahala is absolutely gorgeous, i don't think the pictures online do it justice. It is flanked either side by small rock peninsula's which provide awesome views of the bay/resort and the mountain side. The sun beads are free as are the towels/bed covers - its worth noting a lot of waikiki hotels charge for use of their sun loungers. The selection of beach activities are very good - while not being intrusive to other beach users, there are a selection of canoes/kayaks/surf boards but our favourite was the stand up paddle boards. There is also a small reef which protects the beach from the larger waves and provides ample snorkelling terrain.We ate at the plumeria beach house for breakfast and the beachside bar and grill for lunch. The breakfast buffet was fantastic quality and vast, my favourite meal of the day! Another nice touch is the complimentary Kona coffee they serve untill 8am outside the plumeria beach house. The staff are all excellent - addressing you by name everyday.Another nice touch is the complimentary shuttle service which takes you to the kahala mall, ala moana shopping centre or the centre of waikiki at regular intervals throughout the day and night....this is good as it saves you approx $20 a time in a taxi. It takes approx 15 mins into Waikiki and we used the service most evenings as we loved the dining options that waikiki offers. Yes it is built up, but not in a tacky way - international restaurants, hawaiian style restaurants and plenty of nice shops and bars to keep you entertained.Ok, so my only gripes with the kahala were the spa pricing. We were both looking forward to having a nice massage/treatment upon arrival, but when we saw the price list there was no way we could justify the price. Im sure like everything at the Kahala, the massages/treatments would be outstanding but i would like to see them adjust their pricing to make them more accessible to all.So in summary, i believe the Kahala is the best hotel i have ever stayed in. They helped to make our honeymoon absolutely perfect and i would love to return sometime soon!","Chigwell, United Kingdom","Andy E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chigwell, United Kingdom</strong>",3,5.0

There is a dolphin lagoon and ponds with various turtles and fish. it was beautiful to see the dolphins. We swam with the dolphins previously, this was excellent. There is a large swimming pool, jacquzzi and child's swimming pool. There was plenty of room to get a sun bed at the ,various times of the days we went. there are restaurants that overlook the beach. The beach is small and caters for mainly the guests of the hotel, but continue walking and you walk to residential areas We booked breakfast at the hotel for one night and this was $35 per person without taxes and tip. this was a buffet breakfast and the food was exceptional and well with the money. Plenty of choice from fresh fruit, to continental, yoghurts, pastries, cooked food. The hotel has a complimentary shuttle to Waikiki, Alamano, and kahala mall. You will need to book the shuttle as it does get booked up quite quickly. The first bus starts 10.30 and the last picks up 8.45. This is a good service, but they could look at having a later shuttle back say 10pm. The hotel is about 10 mins in the shuttle. This hotel is in a good location, and away from the main waikiki..

Architecture and decor of the hotel are timeless and luxurious. Dolphins and turtles in hotel premises with secluded beach are perfect for family as well. I hope, one day, hotel provides washer and dryer so we can pack light for children. Hotel staffs are always smiling and provide detail service. One of the staff, Grace Chen, was especially helpful in many different events (especially our memorable wedding!).

I practically wept when it was time to leave. The hotel is outside Honolulu on a beach with views of the ocean, mountains, and palm trees....sitting outside in the early morning, enjoying said view, and one of the best breakfasts I've ever had, I felt pure happiness. This was indeed paradise. We had a junior suite as we were travelling with children and the rooms were large, pretty and clean. There were two large bathrooms and a balcony to enjoy the daily complimentary cocktails. Ok, The Kahala IS expensive but there are deals to be done, and we had breakfast, free wifi (though why any hotel thinks it's acceptable to charge is beyond me), and daily use of a cabana included in our rate. We stayed at The Four Seasons on Maui and The Fairmont Orchid on the Big Island, both wonderful resorts, , but The Kahala was our favourite.","London, United Kingdom","EJYork</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",62,5.0

I really thought that the Kahala would be an excellent experience. It was not. The terrible rating is for the management of the hotel. Upon check in Carlos asked me what time I would be leaving on Sunday. If I were to leave after noon time there would be a charge of $80 That was unusual and made me feel like the hotel is only concerned with revenue and turning the rooms over and certainly no aloha spirit there. I also have never been asked that before upon check in. The reservation was for two and he also asked if a ""Mrs"" would be coming along. Again another unusual question. It reminded me of something that would be asked in the 1950's The toliet clogged and it took them an hour to get someone to correct the issue. At that point I decided to call the manager. His name was Paul Lukela. What a mistake! He was condescending. He said they only took 15 minutes to fix the problem whcih was not true. In additon when I told him what happened at check in he offered no apology. Most people want to relax on vacation and not deal with issues.and the way Paul responded was not acceptable. I asked for the corporate number and Paul's response was oh dont worry I will call corporate and tell them what happened. What does that even mean? It gets worse. I decided to call the general manager Roseann Grippo. I was told she was in a meeting. The entire day Friday passed and she never called back. I called again on Saturday not expecting a manager to be in the office. Again I got voicemail and no return call. Being in a meetng is not an excuse to not call someone back. Since they asked for my email and phone at check in I would have thought that she would have called on Monday. Again no call. I guess she feels that she does not need to for a guest paying $800 per nightThe waitress at breakfast was not attentive and never cleaned the dirty plates. The day before I had a different waitress and when I asked for help with the birds that constantly try and get your food she said ""you know I am not your waitress"" I thought that was an unusual response for a five star hotel. I did speak to the manager Joy and she corrected the issue.

Only a few negatives. It's time for a refreshing of the rooms. The carpet needs replacing, it's showing the signs of wear. The conceige (Julie) was not very good. Sent us to an abandoned Golf course with no driving range! Now for the positives. The Kahala rooms are very spacious and I loved the bathrooms. The rooms were very clean and the bed was spotless (this was nice after my experience with The Ritz, Maui).This was my favorite hotel of the 3 that we had stayed in during our 10 day trip. The view from our room was fantastic,we had a waterfall just outside, a view of the course and a view of the dolphin pool. We ordered room service our first night and it was outstanding! We order the sea salt roasted chicken with potatoes and asparagus. The coconut cake for desert was very fresh and moist. We ordered roomservice for breakfast our last day and it was a home run as well. We are already planning to return to this hotel in March, I wish I had planned a longer stay at the Kahala.

We just returned from a fabulous stay at the Kahala. The property is beautiful and the location is perfect. If you want luxury, beauty, a great beach, and a true Hawaiian experience I would recommend staying at this hotel as it is the best on Oahu. The staff is very friendly and efficient. Food is good, albeit very expensive, and food service is a bit spotty (seemed isolated to cases of new employees).The rooms are well done and they have put thought into ensuring any and all amenities you may need are stocked in your room. We opted for the Oceanfront lanai and it was well worth the price for the view of the dolphin lagoon, the lush grounds, and the water. The hotel attracts tourists from all over the world so you have to go in with an open mind and understanding of different cultures. No place is with without flaws or issues, but the sign of a truly great hotel is how well they are handled. We had a couple of very minor issues and the hotel handled swiftly and professionally. You can take comfort in knowing that the hotel will strive to ensure your happiness during your stay.Here are a couple of words of advice for when you book your stay at the Kahala… 1. If you are an American Express Platinum customer, book your stay through Amex. The discounts that you will receive are substantial (discounted room rates, complimentary breakfast, spa discounts, dining credits, and more). 2. If you are planning on eating at the hotel make your breakfast and dinner reservations in advance. The wait will be long otherwise. 3. Book a cabana! 4. If you happen to have a room facing the ocean, look to the far right of the beach sometime around 3 or 4 pm. You might see paparazzi. We saw them twice. Then you and your travel companion(s) can play the guess-which-celebrity-is-staying-at-the-hotel game.

We were greeted warmly by the fawning staff on arrival and provided leis and flowers. We traveled with our three boys which made an adjoining room necessary and the Hotel did not disappoint. Our rooms were as attractive and sumptuous as we had remembered, accented by bright linens and dark rattan. While not inexpensive, the dining at Plumeria and Room Service was exquisite and bursting with the tastes of Hawaii, Kona coffee in particular was excellent. That said we were somewhat taken back by miscellaneous charges which cropped up such as wifi internet access (tip is free for 30 mins in Business Center), parking, and cabanas.

I also grew up in the area so I know this area well. Looks a little worn at the registration desk especially the floor. Our room was 1226 on the second floor with a partial ocean view. There were two sinks in the bathroom. I had the water running, brushing my teeth and I felt water on my legs. I thought WHAT? I looked under the sink and the drain pipe was totally disconnected so the water was running directly on the floor. Unbelievable. Ate at the seafood buffet for $55 each. I wish I could get my money back. The edges of the sashimi were turning green (old). The poke was overseasoned and there was gristle running through the pieces (lower grade). The sushi rice was too big and not seasoned well if at all. OK, the bad stuff done. The good stuff is that the beach is great. Kahala beach is usually a little windy in the afternoon but the days we were there was just right. The staff was great! Worked very hard and very eager to please. Kathy the bartender, was terrific. Housekeeping staff was very very good. You can tell they took pride in their work. The piano guy at night was soothing, really enjoyed sitting and listening.

That's fine for a smart Adult's hotel, but doesn't seem very child friendly.In brief, it's the sort of lovely quiet place to go as a couple or perhaps to take the children, if you don't really want a family friendly Hotel and all of the noise that entails.Dining can be hugely expensive, although we bought a breakfast package deal which was a reasonable $16 per head, if you don't buy the package expect to pay at least $40 for breakfast...plus extra cost for grapefruit juice or a latte! We didn't have Dinner at the Hotel for the same reason.In conclusion, this is a comfortable, smart hotel for the well healed only. You won't find any Stag Parties staying here!

I have to be honest, we were all dreading leaving the ""real Hawaii"" for the big city Hawaii. However, I wanted my family of four to experience Oahu. WOW!!!! What a way to end our trip!! We were all blown away by the Kahala! We were greeted with smiles, leis and fragrant towels. We were also told that they sold out of our dolphin room, so we were upgraded to a dolphin deluxe at no charge with 2 roll away beds for our twin 12 year olds. We walked into the dolphin deluxe suite and couldn't believe our eyes. The room was absolutely beautiful! We had 4 giant cookies with ""Aloha"" written in chocolate and a bottle of champagne waiting for us. WOW! The room opened up to a patio with dolphins wrestling right outside our door!! My kids were so excited and so were we! The rooms, grounds, ocean, people etc... are all magical! My son sat for hours watching the sea turtles and the fish, while my daughter met all the trainers at the dolphin lagoon along with the owner of Dolphin Quest. The trainers answered any questions, brought the dolphins over by the different viewing areas and told us to get ready at different times for picture taking opportunities. We missed the 6 o'clock shuttle to Waikiki, so we decided to eat at the hotel on Saturday night. We went to the seafood buffet at the hotel. It was like no other seafood buffet we have ever been to. The food, presentation, and sheer assortment of shrimp, sushi, salmon, salads, desserts, etc... were beautiful and best we have ever had a buffet. Even the tea is better at the Kahala! We loved walking the beach and looking at all the million dollar houses. We wanted to rent bikes but ran out of time. The guys at the valet were extremely helpful. They packed us with towels, waters and free boogie boards when they heard we were going up the coast to some other beautiful beaches. Everyone, from the servers to the front desk and valet were shard the aloha spirit. My whole family wished we had more time to spend at this magical place! It was perfect for us. We drove to Diamond Head within 7 minutes and hiked to the top. Then went on to Waikiki to take surf lessons and shop. Going back to the Kahala after a long day was like coming home. We loved the turn down service every night and Tommy Bahama bath amenities. We did not think anything was better than the Four Seasons on Maui, or the Grand Hyatt on Kauai, well the Kahala rivals them both!!

A beautiful setting and everything you need. The dolphin lagoon was excellent and good fun for the whole family.

The facilities here were very good, a spa, gym, shops, dolphins etc and we made use of most of them. The private beach is great with waiters to serve food and drink if needed. the breakfast is vast and caters for all needs. Rooms were spotless and if you needed anything it arrives swiftly. Our two disapointments were that the room wasnt ready when we arrived after a 22 hour trip to get there so we had to wait when all we wanted to do was swim and take advantage of the environment. Still at check in time we were delayed another 30 mins and for a 5 star this wasnt up to standard and a let down. Staff in general were great apart from one in the reastaurant who was seating breakfast or lunch - despite tables being available we had to wait 15 mins. We were told we couldnt even sit and wait or have a drink we just had to wait. The other experience of the Veranda was a girl informed us we couldnt have drinks in the lounge despit all tables being taken in the veranda- and all that after being told we had to wait for an hour for a dinner table. So in other words an hours wait for dinner ( because tables were reserved for hotel giest- not sure what we were then) and we couldnt get a drink either in this lovely 5 star hotel. They got the service very wrong on this day with breakfast, lunch and dinner. Also no apology! Poor for the standard of hotel. Despite a couple of hickups the hotel is lovely and very relaxing.

Everything about this hotel and resort is world class. It's hard to know where to begin. Let me try and break it down.First and foremost I need to say that Flora Lamontagne (Director, Guest Services) went above and beyond to make our stay exceptional. She is a gem. If your reading this, thank you again Flora !! You are the best. Location. Beautifully located in one of the best neighborhoods of Honolulu, sandwiched between a beautiful golf course and a magnificent beach front. No matter which way your room faces, you get a spectacular view. We had a ""partial ocean view"", which means we had a view of the golf course and the mountains studded with what are some pretty amazing houses (even from a distance). I have seen some other reviews that say you pay a lot for the partial view, but frankly some of the ocean front views actually look over the parking lot - so I would rather see a golf couse and mountains myself. It is away from the hustle and bustle of Waikiki - which from my perspective was a substantial blessing. A peaceful oasis of beauty and calm describes the Kahala location.Room. We had a superior room on the 10th floor with a large balcony. Room was beatifully done in what might be termed upscale Hawaian. Very comfy bed with nice linens, very large bathroom with two seperate sinks (one on each side), plus a large tub and good sized stand up shower. Two seperate large warddrobe areas with lots of hangers. Excellent and super quiet air conditioning - nice hair and body goodies - coffee maker - fridge, can't think of anything that falls short. Yes - it was absolutely worth what we paid in my opinion.Service. Superb service from all staff, from front desk to cleaning. Example: Whenever I called for my car, the phone was answered in no more than 3 rings, with a friendly voice saying "" Aloha. How can we help you Mr. Canada?"" If I wanted my ca, it was always there when I got downstairs, no matter how fast I went. Amazing. Room was cleaned spotlessly every day, with turn down service provided. I think we also got water bottles replentished every day. If you were heading to the beach, the valet desk at the front was happy to provide you with towels and extra water. Wonderful. The staff went out of their way to provide advice and direction on where to go and what to do - especially if your like us and want to find those hidden beaches that only the locals know about.Food. The food at the Kahala was excellent, from the beach-front to the upscale Hoku restaurent. Waiters are attentive and well trained, and the chef's are as good or better than you will find at any other restaurent on the island. We ate at all ""the best"" restaurents around (the top 10 per TripAdvisor) so had a good measure by which to go by. The cost was no more expensive than any other top restaurent in it's class. Other. After several trips to the East shore and up to the North shore, we decided to chill and and spend an entire day on the Kahala beach. It was wonderful. We rented a cabana for the day, and swam - had lunch on the beach - and used some of the other fun stuff that is available right there. One of the local companies is on the beach and works with the Kahala to offer outrigger canoe trips and stand up paddle boards and kayaks. We did the 45 minute outrigger canoe trip ($70 for two), and I tried my hand at stand up paddle board Hawaiian style. It was great. Summing it up - one of the best 11 days I have spent in many years and many vacations. The Kahala Hotel and Resort may have spoiled me the same way that travelling Executive Class does when you fly. Once you experience it - everything else just pales in comparison.If you have any specific questions, please feel free to email me.","Ottawa, Canada","Canada_One</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",94,5.0

The reception staff need to left their game and need to be much more welcoming. We had to wait for some time for anyone to greet us or to speak to us when we arrived and we were rather tired having arrived from Sydney.  It took 3 hours to get our room ready but we discovered the holdup was to replace a light fitting in the bathroom. Eventually a receptionist noticed us still waiting and allowed us to go to the room while we waited for 3 men to replace the light fitting. We sat on our partial ocean view balcony while they worked on the light fitting, which took about 15 minutes. It's a pity we had to wait so long in the lobby for maintenance staff to do repairs at 4.30pm in the afternoon.The room was comfortable but the bathroom was dated with the toilet in tiny cupboard sized area.It was hardly a partial ocean view. The view from the balcony was of the golf course and if you leaned over the edge of the right side privacy screen you could see glimpses of the ocean. The table on the balcony was quite rusted and definitely from the 1960’s.It was difficult to find out information about facilities and we missed out on dinning in their signature restaurant because it was booked out on our first night. We then tried for the 3rd and 4th nights of our stay to be told it was closed. There was little choice at the hotel and the food was very pricy for what is was. Eventually we extracted Information from the hotel to get a list of restaurants in the area. Our package included breakfast and we were shocked to find 50 guests crowded ahead of us waiting for tables. Guests who knew to make a reservation sailed in ahead of us.The hotel seemed geared up for Japanese, it was predominately occupied with Japanese tourists and specialized in weddings In fact there were multiple weddings of Japanese tourists every day. Many of the staff were Japanese too and at times I felt like I was in Japan instead of Hawaii. I would have preferred a more Hawaiian experience.The best thing about this resort was the private beach. It was quiet, nicely landscaped and set up with plenty of deck chairs. The staff needs to be more welcoming and helpful with information to guests. We would have appreciated some advice about their restaurants, an offer to make reservations and to warn us about the need to make reservations for breakfast. This hotel has seen better days, it is evident that it was built in the early 1960’s.","Sydney, Australia","annagram09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",300,3.0

After pulling up a winding driveway, you are greeted with a lei and a very attentive staff. I was at the hotel for my daughters wedding, Wow! If you are thinking about a wedding in Hawaii, this is the only place to be. You will not be sorry. The gazebo's (there are 2) ) are so spectacular overlooking the ocean.The layout of the hotel is excellent also. My 17 yr. old daughter was able to walk alone to the dolphin lagoon,the pool and the beach,it was a very safe environment. We had the mountain room. It was calm and very pretty( I especially liked the furniture and the ceiling). I've never felt a bed as soft and comfortable.The sheets were very soft as well.The rooms are so clean as is the entire hotel. The fresh and clean smell is wonderful.

The whole approach of the hotel is geared towards getting as much money out of you as possible and it isn't subtle about it either. The dolphin lagoon and beach area are incredible, beautiful and serene. Overall i'm glad we stayed there due to the fantastic location and some amazing scenery, however we will not be staying there again i'd have thought. I would say that they also need to make the guests children adhere to pool rules, as during our stay the pool was overrun with inflatable dolphins and people somersaulting into the pool. Whilst it is not the hotel's responsibility to teach the (very rude) parents how to look after their children, they could at least make sure the hotel stays peaceful and comfortable for the guests without children.","Haywards Heath, United Kingdom","Stammered</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Haywards Heath, United Kingdom</strong>",35,3.0

The Kahala is not a bad place to visit but it is not at the calibre of other luxury hotels. If I were in the Caribbean it would be as nice as a Sandals but if you are a fan if places like th Trump Chicago or any of the best Vegas hotels this place is not up to par.Lets start:Rooms: we booked a two bedroom suite (2 kids and my wife and I) the rooms were large but worn and dated. The soft bed had a hill in the middle from too many visitors althpugh our view was nice the only suites are located near the elevators so guess what you hear all night. We were on the fifth floor and we could hear everything going on above us...including some adult activities. Patio table on put balcony was rusted and had two chairs.....there were 4 of us. In my opinion if you are trying to be a first class destination you need to anticipate that....duh...maybe all four of us would want a seat on the balcony.Food: food was good at all restaurants but very pricey. Make sure you get the breakfast included as the $160 shocker of a price for four people may bug you. With the suite we got coffee wvery morning delivered...nice but that was it. In addition we were supposed to get preferential seating at Hokus...well the two times we went we say at the Chefs table(basically the worst table in the restaurant.Service: Overall the service was good and the staff tried to go out of their way to remember you. However, as you can imagine we did talk to a manager on our third day about changing rooms due to the issues above. He asked for specifica so I mentioned the patio chairs, noise and lipstick on my coffee cup. He did nothing. He told us there were no other suites available and said he would follow up with us the next day. He did not. I figured they woulD at least have had two more patio chairs brought up or something but no....the concerns were basically ignored.Location: Quiet beach but windy. Private, no nightlife. No surfing at the beach. It was good on the one hand as there were no crowds but most hotels have something going on and this one did not. Dolphins: if tou have done it elsewhere dont bother. Yes they are cute but 125 bucks for 15 minutes?Overall: they have pics of celebrities on the walls but I did not see any from 2012. I think this place was probably a big deal at some point but is now trying to hold onto a past that it cannot sustain. The building is too old and needs too much work. Although the people are nice it is a money making machine first and and seeking repeat clients second. Next time I wilGo someplace that has standards they uphold...not just talk about in the brochures.","Toronto, Canada","631NeilM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",34,2.0

We were treated like royalty, even with teenage kids. The staff are the most pleasant I have ever known. We all went for a massage which was out of this world. The whole experience is expensive. You cannot compare it to a normal hotel and talk about pound for pound value for money. It is something you either save up and commit to it, or don't go. There are some ways of saving money, ie booking a deal with the hotel directly as we did of including breakfast for the room for a knock down price. That saves a fortune and the gratuity is included. Also not eating dinner in the hotel unless you go to a weekend buffet, which is very good value. Signing chits for drinks by the sea is great fun, but expensive. You have to use some common sense here. This is a hotel without comparison that offers you fresh towels by the front door as you leave for a taxi to a beach. You barely have to get dressed by yourself, let alone worry about how to manage anything! Of course it is expensive! The rooms are sublime. Comfort is key here. The bathrooms have his and hers wardrobes and basins. The shower is big enough for at least two! Slightly spooky toilets though. Obviously designed for Japanese with cleaning jets and so on! We tried the reef fishing as well which the boys loved. Swimming with dolphins at the hotel was brilliant. We also hired a driver for a few hours to take us to North Shore for jet skiing and the turtle beach. Our driver was called Brian, attached to the hotel. He talked us through all the history and the geography of the whole island and we stopped off for garlic prawns by the roadside on the way back. Great fun. I have to say, eating in Waikiki was a little cheaper, and we had the best steak meal ever in our lives at the DK Diner on the third floor of the Marriatt Hotel in Waikiki. It was recommended to us by a local and certainly lived up to expectation. Mouth watering. The Spa at the hotel was absolutely wonderful. I had a Samoean lady called Fina who is like a goddess. The massage was like an out of body experience. I have never felt so wonderful. Expense was beside the point. We went to Waikiki expecting a laid back surfing town. Oh my goodness - it is a modern shopping town on steroids! Designer boutiques abound. The Japanese shopping addiction is rife here. Think Bicester Village at full price 50 times bigger! Pricing in the US of hotels and services is always misleading, as they quote a price and then add tax and you have to add gratuity. Something we English do not always take into account. Usually though, the service is so far above what we get in England, we are happy to reward it! We would all love to go to the Kahala again anytime. We have moved off to another island now, which has a great deal to live up to!

While I'll agree with the attraction of getting away from the crowds, I'll agree even more with the criticisms about too many fees and lack of upkeep. A resort charging upwards of 500 dollars a night shouldn't be charging you for internet and forcing you to pay an 18 percent tip on an overpriced ""free"" breakfast. And don't even get me started with the laundry fees -- yikes. Fourteen dollars to launder a toddler dress?! The basic amenities for Surfrider were every bit the equal of Kahala, without the incredibly windy weather and smaller beach whose water lacked the clear blue because of the breakers off shore. The food at Plumeria House was mediocre as well, hardly to a five-star standard.

Upon our arrival we were greeted by bellmen and then my family and I were ""lei'd"" w/ beautiful shells by a hostess. We were then escorted to reception and was asked to wait an hour before our rooms were ready. Now how can you complain about the wait when your backyard is the beautiful ocean. As a Leaders Club member we were upgraded to the Dolphin Lanai from Partial Ocean View Lanai, all the more reason why there's no complaint about waiting an hour for the room. DINING:While waiting for our room we had lunch at the Seaside Grill which was SUPER EXPENSIVE! 3 salads/1 kids meal/4 beers/3 cocktails came out to $170 for LUNCH! They offer a pretty good buffet breakfast at a pricey $39/person. However, all-in-all the culinary at the Kahala needs improvement. I highly recommend you eat elsewhere. THE ROOM:The room is very spacious. We got a King and a rollaway and still had plenty of space to walk about. I must commend HOUSEKEEPING! They are awesome! Whenever I had a request, I simply just wrote a note, left a little tip and voilà! For example, after our first night, we noticed our bed was super noisy and lumpy and I knew there was no way I could sleep another night. So I left a note asking if it would be possible to replace the bed and so they did. The bathroom was spacious w/ his/hers sinks & closets.

No little stuffed animals that the hotel makes and sells as gifts for the children.The Hotel Manager must either have a low standard or the owner is too cheap because all through out the hotel there are areas that need to be kept more perfectly in terms of fresh paint or cleaning.

It was close enough to go into town in our rental car, have a great dinner, some ice cream and then go back to the peace + quiet of Kahala. The hotel was pretty empty while we were there, mostly older Japanese tourists, so we did miss interacting with younger couples, which we found at Four Seasons. I didn't love the beach at Kahala but it got us to explore the other side of the island - spending the day at Makapu'u Beach for a day was one of my favorite things on the trip. While it was smaller, personally I found the breakfast at Kahala to be tastier than Four Seasons, hotel for week #2 of our honeymoon. I lived on waffles for the week :-) Shelly the omelet chef was our new best friend. A++The staff was very friendly - concierge was great to suggest off-the-beaten-path things for us to see. The pool-side staff, while friendly, was very thin so it was kinda tough to get service, despite it being empty. Some of the drinks were absurdly priced, too. $14 for a weak pina colada was crazy. I've read some reviews say the staff was not friendly. We didn't see any of this. Everyone from the front desk to valets were exceptionally friendly to everyone we saw. I wonder if the reviewers who say ""unfriendly"" are rude themselves -- or unreasonably demanding. We did receive our upgrade (breakfast buffet included and free parking!) by booking with a travel agent but our room had a very, very minor gnat problem; they upgraded us on Day 3 when we finally said something and immediately moved our rooms to one with a partial ocean view. They were very apologetic, so it was no big deal at all. They handled it perfectly. We did have a car so able to head into Waikiki when we wanted and explore other parts of the island. We would have been bored without the car -- the resort was very quiet (middle of June). It's definitely not in a hoppin' area.

The location, privacy and proximity to a nice beach was exactly what we wanted. The house cleaning, valet, pool and bell staff were excellent. They truly made us feel at home and tried to satisfy our every request. The valet staff truly excelled by thinking of what we needed even when we didn't, such as providing water when we went hiking up Diamond Head and asking if we needed umbrellas when it was raining. The only thing that disappointed us was our dining experience. As much as the other parts of the staff excelled the dining staff suffered. The attentativeness of the wait staff was mediocre at best and at times lacking. An example of such a case was when we were served the wonton soup appetizer but were not provided soup spoons. Also consistency was lacking. After realizing we did not order enough we had ordered another wonton soup and the second came out with a piece of shrimp tempora on it while the first did not have any. And again no soup spoons was provided. Also I had ordered a special cake for my wife's 40th birthday to be served after our dinner but the staff forgot and had to spend quite a bit of time trying to find it, to the point one of my children fell asleep waiting. I will say that the manager there did make us feel that he was truly sorry about it, but it shouldn't have happened in the first place considering I had ordered the cake months in advance to make the arrangements. Another area of improvement that our dining experience needed was the quality and taste of our entrees. The food was just ""ok"". It was not bad but not something I would consider up to the quality of the rest of your resort and definitely not on par of which we were paying for.Also the available food selection for our children was very poor. Even my young children have tastes beyond chicken strips and cheese pizza. It was not practical for them to have so few choices for a week long stay. Some additional pasta or other choices would have made us more likely to eat at the resort more.","San Jose, California","FamilyTraveler583</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",4,4.0

While other resorts and hotels may have your room ready when you get there and the front desk staff may check you in promptly, at the Kahala Resort, we felt like they were just waiting for us to arrive so that they could treat us like royalty. Upon check-in, Linda described our pre-assigned room and then gave us keys to 2 rooms and suggested that we view both and then call her from the room we wanted to stay in and she would have our luggage delivered to it. The rooms were equally luxurious, so we picked the one on the higher floor. On every second encounter with a staff member, they always greeted us by name. All the staff was exceptionally helpful and eager to please, e.g., when the valet brought my car around, he asked if I needed directions and then proceeded to draw a map that took me exactly to the ArtsFest at Kapiolani Park and on to the art museum. I must admit that with all the royal treatment, I actually had to convince my hubby to leave the resort and see other things on Oahu. The Kahala has several restaurants and the 3 we tried all had excellent food with varied selections. Our most delicious meal was at the the Oceanside Grill, and we enjoyed tasty breakfasts in the Plumeria. Live music by wonderful pianist David Swanson provided a romantic backdrop for cocktails and dinner in The Veranda, a magnificent space.I guess royalty doesn't spend much time on the internet, but we're accustomed to checking our email each morning and internet service in guestrooms is an extra charge -- unexpected in an ocean of wonderful experiences.","Silver Spring, Maryland","TravelingIBMretiree</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Silver Spring, Maryland</strong>",11,5.0

We knew we were going to stay at the Four Seasons in Maui, but agonized over our first 3 nights in Oahu We saw some touchy comments on this site, but in the end booked a suite (with the amenities package) and could not have been happier.We booked a partial ocean view suite (which was awesome) for our family of three. My 15 year old daughter really loved her own bathroom and my wife and I the extra room. I think the suite package was very reasonable when you consider the airport transfers and very pampering in the niceties of morning coffee delivery and evening Pupus and cocktails. The cost of 2 rooms would have been more and 1 room without amenities not that much less.Reception was seemless, including lei greeting and a relly nice man playing ukulee and singing great Hawaiin tunes for your pleasure. Service without exception was friendly and spot on. Loved that they remembered to fill the ice bucket each night at turn down.The grounds were very well cared for and the ""private beach"" really great and calm for swimming. My wife and daughter did stand up paddle boarding one morning with Peter (he was really patient and genuinly nice) and had no problem switching from a surf lesson to paddle board even with no notice and a lower billing for his company.I mention this, because at no time did I experience any nickle and diming as some reviewers have suggested. Of course, when staying at a resort of this caliber you should expect to tip generously for the service and experiences you are enjoying.One note on location, we found it perfect for us, but if you are staying for more than a few days, a rental car would be nice. We did use the shuttle one aftrnoon and rented a car for one day right at the resort. Both experiences very easy.Breakfast at Plumeria each morning was really good and the location stunning. We were at first disappointed to find on our arrival that Plumeria had recently been closed for dinner on Wednesdays. However, we ended up enjoying our first night meal at the Veranda off of the lobby. Very comfortable (we ordered off the Hokus menu and the more casual Veranda menu and enjoyed the best of both worlds). Im sure I am missing something, but let me reiterate book the room you want/can at this resort and be prepared to really enjoy yourself. When we return to Oahu I would not consider staying anywhere else. Sorry about any misspellings but very tired from 24 hours of delayed travel home from Maui yesterday.","Elkton, Maryland","madasa1024</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Elkton, Maryland</strong>",88,5.0

We've stayed in a number of high end hotels around the world, including names such as Ritz Carlton, St. Regis, Four Seasons, Orient Express, and others. This may be the best place we've ever stayed. It is not luxury in a stuffy manner - but they've got the simple elegance of island luxury down. It was like staying at a (very) wealthy uncle's oceanfront home. Four things make this resort stand out - and only one thing brings it down.1) Staff Friendliness. I cannot remember making eye contact with someone who worked at the Kahala who did not say hello (or aloha or good morning). They were so friendly and accommodating - from the escort to the suite and the explanation of the resort (for which a gratuity was declined) to addressing our many requests, such as our rotating times for coffee and drinks (see suite amenities).2) The Suite. This room was huge. There was a very large (700 sq ft?) bedroom, an equally sized living room, and two full bathrooms, each with double vanities, standing showers, tubs, and closets. And very well appointed with nice furnishings. Every suite comes with a range of 'extras' such as morning coffee, afternoon drinks and appetizers, cabana at the pool, etc. I know that you pay for these with your room rate, but it is a nice touch to know that you have all these things - we even made it an evening ritual after the pool time was over to come up to the room, shower for dinner, and order our cocktails. Very nice touch.3) Marine Life and Landscaping. At the resort are the much trumpeted dolphins, but also there are sea turtles, colorful fish, and birds. This and the general well appointed resort just made everything beautiful. The entire resort was a postcard.4) The Veranda. I wasn't expecting this, but the Veranda at night had an entertainer who was so exceptionally good, just sitting there having a drink was an event by itself. I think that most nights, I went down there for a drink and to listen to some outstanding music.5) Location. Some people may not like the seclusion of the resort, but for us, the distance from Waikiki was a huge advantage. Having just stayed at the Royal Hawaiian the two nights before, we were looking for something away from hubbub of the traffic and the strip. The Kahala is all by itself among multi-million dollar homes. We had the public beach to ourselves (who would venture out that far to get there) and never ever had any difficulty finding a place for ourselves.As I said, I had very few complaints/areas for improvement. For a resort of this quality, you would expect an equally spectacular pool. However, it was only a very simple, oval pool like you might find on a nice cruise ship. Also, the coral was so abundant and so close to shore the actual useable ocean near the resort beach was quite limited. However, the best accolade I can give the Kahala is that my 7-year old daughter, for the second week of our 2-week trip to Hawaii, kept saying about every other hotel - ""this is nice, but it doesn't compare to the Kahala."" I wouldn't hesitate to go back.","Richmond, Virginia","SheMakes3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",31,5.0

We come to Hawaii most years and have just spent over 4 weeks on Oahu in wonderful rented houses by the ocean.As we drove into the garage, we thought it said $4 for the first half hour but can be validated. Our bad that we did not read more carefully. It turns out, it's $4 for the first 10 minutes, then $35!!!! You could spend $25 at the resort and get validation but we had already spent $12 for two Haagendaz ice cream bars and knew there was nothing we wanted to purchase, so simply paid up. But, it hurt and makes us never want to come back. Not a good way to drum up new business! #disappointedThe resort seemed nice but a bit cramped and dated. From the pictures in the hotel, you can see that it used to be a place celebrities had dinner at and some stayed there. But this seems to have been a while ago. And as the parking attendant told us, they just introduced the very expensive parking fees - probably to reestablish exclusivity. I think this is a nicer location than Waikiki, as it is quieter, and there are obviously not a lot of resorts outside Waikiki on Oahu. I think for the money, you can get a much better value at the Turtle Bay Resort in a quiet and natural setting. But, if you like to see and be seen, this might be the place.","San Francisco, California","princessvontrapp_7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",216,1.0

This is the way to holiday, yes it is pricey but you get what you pay for . We had a Dolphin Lanai room close to the end of the building so only a short walk out of the building down the steps to beach, this room was quite expensive compared to std rooms, the resort is so good though a std room would make for just as an enjoyable stay.

As in the past, we greatly enjoyed our stay. I have previously posted about prior stays so feel free to review my post from June 2011. Instead of providing another point-by-point description of the various amenities, let me give some general observations and advice.As many have noted, the Kahala is not a brand spanking new hotel. It is definitely an older property and the style is likewise not ultra-modern. If you are looking for super updated, slick and shiny, the Kahala is not the place for you. Instead, it has a relaxed charm while still being upscale.About the rooms: unless you are booking a suite, the rooms (at least in my experience) are pretty much the same. We have had 5 different rooms in both the tower and the dolphin wing and all were virtually identical; we also tried a suite which was gorgeous but expensive. There really are only primary two variations in non-suite rooms (well three, if you count price): view and balcony. The only other variation is the tower, Diamond Head v. Koko Head. The Diamond Head Tower is closer to the parking lot and hotel entrance while Koko Head looks more over the dolphin lagoon and is slightly closer to the beach. In case you haven’t seen it, the hotel has a color coded map showing where each room category is located: http://www.kahalaresort.com/rooms-suites/index.cfmDecide which components are important to you, what you can afford, and go with it. I personally prefer the Koko Head Tower or the dolphin lagoon rooms. We have always chosen to have a balcony and have made great use of it. One more tip on room selection: do not expect to be upgraded from the category you book. Unlike other hotels we have stayed at, the Kahala does not seem to do this, even when rooms are available, for special occasions (or when you are multi-repeat customers like we are).Now for the criticism. First let me say that I find the staff that you interact with day to day to be amazing. They are extremely friendly and accommodating – the staff in the spa and bar remembered us from a year ago. But I think that hotel management should take a serious look at its higher-level customer service practices. In addition to my earlier comment about room upgrades (not to mention the point in my prior review about our ignored anniversary) I am very much starting to agree with comments from posters about being charged for everything. Case in point: we asked if a late check-out would be possible. Absolutely! We could check out at 2 pm – for the bargain fee of $80. Really? Come on now, either you can do it or not. If not, no biggie, but $80 for 2 additional hours? Sorry, but much as I enjoy your hotel, even I, an extremely loyal customer, cannot overlook that one. I have already overlooked the high parking, internet, beach chair, etc. charges but I have never seen a late check-out fee before. I sure hope this is just the Kahala.Sorry for the rant, but on our last day, this really rubbed us the wrong way. In any event, I still give it 5 stars. We very much enjoyed our stay from food, to spa, to room, to beach. Just know the lay of the land so your expectations will be reasonable from the high-level service perspective.Notwithstanding the foregoing, we definitely recommend the hotel and will probably stay again on future stays.","Orange County, California","SarahInSoCal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",166,5.0

From the minute we arrived we felt like special guests. I have stayed at 5 star resorts before, including The Four Seasons and The Ritz-Carlton, but the service we received at The Kahala exceeded both of those. All of the staff greets you by name throughout your stay. If you have gone to dinner in Hokus, the next morning when you are at the breakfast buffet the hostess/servers ask about your experience the night before. We had the breakfast buffet included in our package. It was a very nice start to each day - great views and good food.We had a corner room on the top floor with partial ocean view. It was a beautiful view of the golf course and ocean. Since we were on the top floor, the balcony was very windy, to the point that we needed jackets out there at night. Room was very nice and well appointed. Some aspects of the hotel show a bit of age, but overall grounds are beautiful and well kept. We will definitely stay here again when we return to Hawaii.

It was 3:30 and we were asked to move. Really? Since when does the price of the room not entitle us to sit anyway. Reminds of those hotels who tried the ""resort Fee"" and we all know how that went over. Went to the bar for a drink at the hotel lobby bar area and ordered 2 nice glasses of wine. Was expecting some nuts or something while enjoying our drinks before dinner however nothing arrived. When we asked the very lovely server said ""of course she would bring something"". Next a small bread plate arrived with a handful of peanuts! Tacky and just embarrassing. It would have been better if she just said they don't serve anything.

Nice big lobby, with our room being on the 3rd floor with a mountain view. To be honest, the view was still spectacular even if it wasn't the sea. The rooms was lovely, 2 massive double beds, great big bathroom, nice shower, seperate sinks. Nice and spacious. The maids were very polite and friendly, always saying hello.We were quite surprised when we got to the pool area. The actual pool is tiny compared to the size of the hotel. I get the impression this is quite an old hotel with some heritage as is shown by all the photos they have hung up in the main corridor of all the famous people who have visited. And maybe back then having a large pool was not so important. Ironically there is a pool lagoon, where they have a turtle or two and some dolphins. I guess it depends on whether you agree with dolphins in captivity or not, but the kids seemed to enjoy it. Personally I would open that pool to the public and release the dolphins :) Service is not the best at the restaurant at breakfast. It's not cheap, $30+ per person, and clearly they have more guests than seats, as there is a queue, yet I always saw empty tables, so I think maybe it's moer about the time to clear tables. But the view from the breakfast restaurant over the ocean is incredible. Breakfast too is a little disappointing. Nice lady who makes the omelettes but I don't think she knows how. Several people returned theirs. More scrambled than Omelette.The gym is great, with modern equipment, headphones etc. Hotel also provides a free shuttle to Waikiki town centre, although it's incredibly touristy, top end stores catering to wealthy Japanese tourists, designer stores etc. Parking was $30ish a day, not cheap. But having a small pool and small beach area, gave us an incentive to hire a car from Waikiki and drive up to North Shore and drive around the perimiter of the island. Awesome.

From the moment we pulled up into their circular driveway one could feel the understated mid-century elegance ,casual sophistication & warm aloha that exudes from the Kahala hotel & professional staff. Amazingly well kept throughout the property Kahala truly feels like your peaceful luxurious home away from home !Most staff are proudly & amazingly the same some after nearly 15-20 years ! I think this says alot about a resort. Rooms are cool,spacious & soothing in light cream & white tones with solid wood beds. Bathrooms are long & spacious.

Most people probably feel that it's a ""schlep"" and inconvenient distance from all the action of Waikiki , but that's exactly what Kahala's asset is . It's designed to be an oasis from the noise of modern urban Honolulu citylife !! Car rental is essential to shuttle to & from Waikiki or do excursions up North . Kahala's not cheap (ie $500 +/ nt ) but show me what is anymore . But I'm selfish and shouldn't even be writing this because I'd like to keep Kahala an exclusive secret hideaway. So please don't listen to me .

We had stayed before at the Outrigger Reef in Waikiki, and this time, for our wedding anniversary, decided to splurge a bit and stay at the Kahala. I guess I expected too much - from the reviews and from the photos online. Don't get me wrong - the room was beautiful, the mountain view was nice (overlooking the golf course), the lobby was grand, the overall architecture of the hotel was gorgeous, the dolphin lagoon was a pleasant surprise, but there were certain things that just disappointed my wife and I. The foremost negative experience was the room service schedule. Their website said 24 hours. And in our room, the menu listed schedules for 10:30 PM onwards. My wife and I got back to the hotel late at night, went to the gym with the intent of having room service for dinner after gym. So, after looking at the menu, and choosing the food, when we called room service, we were shocked to learn that the service was closed from 10 PM to 6 AM. So, we couldn't eat. I then went down to the lobby and asked the front desk if I could order from any of their restaurants (Hoku, Plumeria, Veranda), but Bart of the front desk said all were closed already. That was frustrating. There I was, hungry from working out, and we couldn't order food. Bart tried to do his best by getting food from his office (I'm assuming the food was his), and though his intention was good, I felt insulted by what he did, like I was receiving hand-me-downs from him. I felt they didn't go out of their way to help me with my problem. I decided to ask about nearby food joints that were open and he suggested a McDonald's (which closes at 11 PM - this was around 1045 PM already). Again, I guess Bart assumed I had a car, which I didn't. The whole experience was sorely disappointing, for a hotel that had a high reputation. Moreover, the hotel didn't even have a 24-hour convenience store?! I mean, the hotel is located around 6 kilometers from Waikiki and Kalakaua (you're surrounded by the golf course and apartments, and no 7-11 stores within walking distance). Needless to say, the next night, my wife and I bought take-out food from the Royal Hawaiian Center food court for our late dinner. The other negative experience was the bed and pillows. By the 2nd night, my wife and I had stiff necks from the pillows. The bathroom in our room looked old. It looked out of place versus the room itself, which was beautiful. The tiles in the bathroom were ugly. As for the room itself, it was very nice. Spacious, with lots of sunlight, a huge window showing the mountains and the golf course. It was nice that when you entered the room after checking in, the CD played soft guitar music - relaxing. The breakfast was superb. We got the breakfast package so we had breakfast every morning (expensive, at 77usd for 2 pax). You had eggs, sausages, rice, fruits, salad, yogurt, cereals, oatmeal - great selection. The staff in the Plumeria restaurant during breakfast were nice - like Corrine.The beach area was not as good as I thought it would be. The shore was not wide. The water was too shallow for swimming and snorkeling. The water was murky when I tried swimming. I noticed that not a lot of people were lounging at the beach area. Yes, you have some privacy in the beach, but after a while, it was boring. Having a free shuttle to the Ala Moana Mall and Royal Hawaiian Center was very important for us, because then we could eat and shop and stroll in the Kalakaua area. If you decide to stay at the Kahala, buy some take-out food and water from Royal Hawaiian or Ala Moana Mall for your late night eats. The people in the Kahala were good. Allison of the Business Center was great and accommodating, the check-in staff were ok, the bell desk people were helpful (like Dean). They always tried to address us by our surnames. You had 30 mins free Internet in the Business Center daily. And you had free water bottles every night when the housekeeping staff turned down your bed.A surprising touch was the dolphin lagoon. We didn't expect that we'd be able to see dolphins anytime we wanted. It was fun seeing the dolphins there. Make sure you look at the photos on the wall going to the Business Center - you'll see all the celebrities who've stayed at the Kahala - like Alicia Keys and Michael Jackson. It's a shame that we had negative experiences at the Kahala. But the room was nice, the service was good, the breakfast was delicious, the hotel grounds were beautiful. I just wish they'd have a convenience store (sell snacks and sandwiches), and also have a microwave in the room so that night owls can eat at night. And change the pillows and bed please. For the same price, one could stay at one of the hotels on Kalakaua (like Halekulani or even the historic Royal Hawaiian Hotel). I don't think we'll stay at the Kahala again.","Manila, Philippines","JW1023</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",45,3.0

Though you are near Waikiki for shopping, beach activites, and food - you feel a thousand miles away. The pace is so much calmer at the Kahala. We loved watching the dolphins! You should swim with them if you stay here. We did it on our honeymoon and it is an experience we will never forget. We had the best jumbo prawns while sitting on the veranda. The rooms are exceptional. This is a place to go if you want pampering.

The carpet needed cleaning. We found the restaurant menu after 18 months (last visit) was basically the same and choices are limited. The room service menu needs a serious update. The Kahala is a five star resort I can make a tastier pizza at home than the one served to us the night the main restaurant was closed. Very disappointing.

You had to make reservations for breakfast or stand around for an hour waiting to have your name called. Not what you want to do in Hawaii! Plus, I hated to see the creatures on display.

The decor of the hotel is pleasing. The dolphins and the seclusion are the highlights. Based on our experience and other reviews the standard of service, cleanliness and upkeep is not consistent and is not always acceptable. For surfing, swimming and sunsets I would recommend one of the Waikiki hotels. For calm and quiet the Kahala could be for you. Use hotel website to check for specials and promotions or call them. Website has diagram of room locations. Our experience:1 hour before check-in our room was ready. No lei greeting, leis are included in some packages but not all. I declined to pay extra for them, as for me that defeats the purpose. We had enjoyed leis at other top hotels already. The room (dolphin lanai): the minibar in the room is empty. An empty fridge can indeed be useful, but understand there was no bottle of water, nothing, in the room. To have a sip of water we would have had to order and wait for room service. (Maybe the tap water is fine, but facing a long flight the next day it is not the time to take a chance). Room and bathroom/dressing area spacious, pleasant color scheme, furniture especially beds not to my taste but not bad. Bedding is of a high quality. Nice view of dolphin lagoon and dear child very happy to find a little stuffed dolphin on bed. However I don't think I have ever been in a room with that many scuff marks and digs in the walls. Next to everything that moved, there was a deep dig into the plasterwork: the lights above the beds, the television, even the towel rails next to the vanities. I felt insulted to be put into a room in that state of repair. We were there as a special treat for our dear child, so I sucked it up. Toilet is in a closed off tiny room, on the plain and ugly side, but more disturbing to me were 2 marks next to the toilet roll holder that I was able to easily clean off. Shame my disinfecting wipes got thrown away by mistake that morning. Dh and I clean the 2 chairs on our lanai which were filthy. Verandah: We had a late lunch and tea on the open air part of the verandah, decent food, very helpful hostess, very peaceful setting. Off to the beach. We let the pool/beach boys help us so they could explain which seating needs to be rented and which not, etc. Lots of complimentary loungers available. Our towels were lain on loungers and then the beach/ pool guy walked away, leaving us to brush the pile of sand from the previous users off of the foot part. I can't believe it. I think of the St. Regis pool boys, trotting back and forth with warm towels on a drizzly day, and immediately cleaning up when someone left. The beach in front of the Kahala is peaceful (nearly empty) and the waves break quite far offshore - you cannot bodysurf or boogeyboard here, for us disappointing, but not the Kahalas fault. There is a platform one could swim to and jump off of, fun for dc. Dh tries swimming parallel to the beach, but the depth varies and he could not swim properly as too shallow in parts. Maybe unlucky. Dh, like another reviewer, suspects the sand is industrial and does not belong on a beach, I did not look too closely. We tried out the main pool, a reasonably sized oval with a built in bench along one side. Had fun there with dc until 6pm, when pool closes. There is also a small pool for toddlers and a hot tub/jacussi - but the ?hot tub had an ugly strip of plastic yellow tape across its entrance while we were there. During our short stay 2 weddings and 1 event are held, but to the sides of the pool and beach area, we didn't feel inconvenienced and dc enjoys glimpsing the brides. Back to our room to bathe - dc choses the tub, so I checked it - 2 pale (head) hairs, I looked closer and then ran my hand inside - lots of white residue, soap scum or product residue. We were furious. I called housekeeping, who came a few minutes later and started cleaning. In our wet bathing suits and beach covers we waited half an hour to have use of the bathroom. Following regulations the door to our room was jammed wide open, so in that time our family and our things were on full view to those passing by. At least we had a lanai, so we waited there and watched the dolphins and a chopped piece of the sunset. The location of the Kahala is not the best for sunsets. I spoke to the manager, who apologised and offered to make some form of ammends. We chose to go to the Friday night buffet at the Plumeira beach house and the hotel offered to pick up the tab of dinner and a round of drinks, which was something and calmed dh down somewhat. The food at the buffet was excellent, we went back and forth more than we usually do. We did not hear other guests from our room, but the airco does cycle on and off so make arrangements if you are a light sleeper. I had a hurried but good breakfast and took dc to a kid's Dolphin Quest program - an hour of marine animal instruction and 30 minutes with the dolphins for $287. Dc was the only one signed up that morning, so I did feel it was fair value and a fabulous experience. Not sure in a small group with less dolphin time how I would have felt. The trainers were really really great with our dc. I did find that $150 for a cd of the photos taken robbery. Later dc spent a few happy hours with a new friend by the pool before we checked out. I paid $80 to have the room for 2 more hours, which I suppose is a reasonable charge compared to the room rates, but I had to be moved to another room for those 2 hours. It was all easily arranged with the front desk and bell boy staff, who were very helpful and courteous. Dc (5) loved loved loved the dolphins, but found the pink palace (Royal Hawaiian) better because of the surfing at Waikiki and the slide at the neighbouring Sheraton's pool.","Berlin, Germany","jcc03_12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",20,3.0

If you think it is too expensive don't go! I think it is worth the money, you would pay a lot of money for a hotel in England and nowhere in England is a nice a Hawaii!

The Kahala is located in the best area of Honolulu, quiet and well taken care of , but also very close to the action of Waikiki. The hotel has a shuttle bus going to Waikiki regularly. The staff is great, food in the restaurants ( Hoku's and Plumeria ) is also the best you can get. We did not try the Tokyo Tokyo restaurant so I cannot comment. The Cabanas Seaside grill is o.k to have some fast food. The gym is very well equipped and my wife loved the fitness classes. It is difficult to imagine that the hotel was built in 1964.

We felt that we should post a review as we always use trip advisor ourselves prior to going anywhere. We came to the states from the UK and to his was a wonderful place to stay.We've never been to Hawaii before but the reaction from other people on the island, was that the Kahala resort is the ""Beverly Hills of Hawaii"". After our stay of 10 days we can say we felt that the service was fantastic, the hotel is beautiful, impeccable standards and cleanliness and very welcoming, we got garlands on arrival and as a honeymoon present a bottle of sparkling wine in our room which was unexpected and a great start to a fantastic break.There are a variety of places to eat within the hotel all of which have excellent standards, one of the best was an afternoon tea with champagne in the veranda restaurant overlooking the dolphin lagoon.If partying is your style this would most probably not be the best option as Waikiki is 15 mins down the road by taxi or bus and has all the hustle and bustle you might like. We enjoyed the serenity, peaceful tranquillity, privacy and personal beach service at the Kahala however we made full use of the free shuttle bus which took us into Waikiki and back within specified times. We made full use of room service in our spacious room with huge bed, lovely bathroom, separate shower/dressing area, fridge, turn-down service with plenty of chilled bottled water.Although we didn't have a sea view, the balcony was well worth it, sitting watching the sun go down over ancient volcanic mountains with a cold beer in hand after a hard day sunbathing on the private beach was particularly enjoyable. We took a couple of excursions from the resort, you can book and pay in the hotel and get their friendly advice, and away you go for the day.It's a long way to go half way around the planet to stay somewhere for a week or so but this was definitely worth it, 5 star means 5 star at the kahala!

This impression has usually been formulated from motion pictures, TV and glossy brochures. The one resort where the promise is surpassed by the actuality is the beautiful Kahala hotel and resort. Having been fortunate enough to visit frequently I am happy to report it just does not, and probably could not get any better than it is. A magnificent location,serene, beautifully laid out and impeccably cared for, anything and everything you could possibly wish for in a perfect vacation is at your fingertips.Location, no matter how important, fades quickly if the service is not of the same standard. Have no fear, there is nowhere on the planet that you will be treated more graciously than here at the Kahala. From arrival until departure you are nurtured as if you were royalty. Not surprising really they just truly do not know any other way to treat their guests.On your visit you will be amazed at how important you are made to feel. When you return (and you will return) you will be further staggered by how many of the things you need, or prefer are remembered and prepared for upon your return visit,It is virtually impossible to select any one area of this wonderful place as special because every part that you visit will impress you. Check in is smooth and all that you have requested will be exactly as you wanted it. Room - large, clean comfortable and every possible amenity you will need, and some you wont. The Spa, a truly 'died and gone to heaven' experience. On arrival check with Angelie and if Saori is available allow her to provide a memorable and incredibly relaxing massage. The food of course is excellent with a choice of Hokus, the Plumeria (my personal favorite) where the food, especially the nightly chefs preparation equal any offering in a higher priced location. Snacks on the beach, tea in the veranda, anywhere you choose to eat you can be assured of attentive service. Were I to name all of the ladies and gentlemen who make the dining experiences at the Kahala special it would take up far too much space. After your first culinary visit you will understand exactly what I mean.When deciding on your vacation hotel by all means check out the other properties and then make the smart decision and head straight for the Kahala.

The room itself was spacious, even with 2 beds in the room. Service was great at the restaurant each morning for our delicious breakfast buffet and also at the pool where we spent lots of time just hanging out, swimming & drinking mai-tais & lava flows. The pool is small for a resort this size, but the beach is great for swimming and there was a neat inflated raft we swam out to with the kids every day. We used the activities desk to try out paddle boarding one day and it was really convenient (paddle boarding was fun, but challenging when you're going against the tide). One of the activities desk staff even took our girls out to the end of this jetty to ""fish"" while we were paddle boarding. I'm not sure if this is something they do for everyone, but very much appreciated by us.This is such a relaxed environment vs. Waikiki. We love the Halekulani on Waikiki beach, but that's not a family place, so this was a great place to relax with the kids.

I called reservations explained my horrific experience, and was invited to come take a look at the Kahala. The reservationist made arrangements for the manager to meet us in the lobby. First, let me say the drive over from Waikiki, was so pleasant. Finally I felt like I was in Hawaii, and not Venice Beach, California. The closer we got to the hotel the better the surroundings. The area is like being in one of the better areas of Maui. The Kahala is a beachfront property located on a secluded corner of the island, that is only accessible to hotel guests. When we arrived the courteous manager personally escorted us to view 2 rooms they had in mind for my husband and I and our 2 teens. They were gorgeous, spacious (each over 500 sft.), and well appointed rooms with really nice views. We immediately checked in and headed to the pool and beach areas. Right outside the back of the lobby next to the pool there were, dolphins, turtles, fish, and a stingray. We arrived seeing the dolphins being fed and putting on a heck of a show. You can swim with the dolphins for a fee. The pool was decent, but who needs a pool when you have a private beautiful beach, with excellent attendant service to set up your complimentary lounge chairs and towels where ever you prefer. Each night we returned to our room after dinner, we would walk into a clean room with soft music playing, low lighting, the bed turned down, floor mats on both sides of the bed with a bottle of cold water on each nite stand. The bathroom was very nice, over sized and split, as in his and her sides with robes and slippers for your use. The towels and the high end toiletries were refreshed twice a day. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a variety of foods to please just about any nationality. The view from every area of the hotel was fantastic, from the lobby to the restaurant to your guestroom. Valet service was efficient with friendly knowledgeable staff. The fitness room was well appointed. Both women and men locker rooms had a dry sauna, steam room, spa, showers, and toiletries. There are fitness classes and personal trainers for a fee. If you are one to get excited about seeing celebrities or dignitaries, you may run into a few staying at the Kahala. If nothing else you will feel like one or the other with such great service and surroundings.

From inside the room, we could see the ocean.

The resort is in a quiet neighborhood, far from the bustle of Waikiki, and yet only minutes away. It's actually easier and faster to get to the airport from here than from the Waikiki hotels.

My husband, our baby boy (7 months) and I. It was worth every penny and even though it's expensive, it's also close to flawless. Of course, this all depends on your expectations and what you are looking for. We were trying to avoid the crowds at Waikiki, looking for a more secluded beach, a quiet but comfortable hotel with a choice of restaurants (so to avoid having to go to Waikiki), but close enough to the city centre to be able to go shopping a day or two.For this purpose, the Kahala is perfect. They have a free shuttle bus which we used for the Ala Moana shopping mall and Waikiki - for a walk down the busy streets. It doesn't run all the time and it pays off to sign up for it, but it's very handy and works well. Not sure it would work if you go out all night dancing, but then you can probably take a taxi. For us, it was perfect with our own beach which did not seem crowded or busy at all. With a baby we were at the pool quite early and never had any problems with sun chairs - even if we came late morning or early afternoon it was possible to get a chair - easily.The choice of restaurants is perfect. We had roomservice (nice and convenient with a baby) a few times as well as dinner at practically all the restaurants. They are pricey, but from a European's point of view, it's not pricey taking into consideration what you get. The sushi restaurant serves delicious sushi and japanese courses and the service and ambience was relaxed and personal. No problem at all with a baby sleeping in a stroller. We came in early and asked in advance if it was ok.Their upscale restaurant (forgot he name) was amazing. Again, expensive, but we live in Copenhagen, so not so bad in comparison. Even here we asked and got an ok to bring a sleeping baby in a stroller. The service was fantastic. They were very accomodating and nice to move us to one end of the restaurant, since a rather noisy party was right next to us to begin with. We always try to be not too much of a burden if we bring a baby and get in and leave as early as possible so as not to be of any inconvenience, but they did not make us feel uncomfortable at all. On the contrary. We had one of the best dinners of our holidays in Hawaii. In other words: we were absolutely fine with the location, quiet, family friendly (without being swarmed with noisy children) and beautiful! Forget about serene, beautiful sunsets if you're in Waikiki. Expect there to be a million others right next to you taking a picture. At Kahala, on the other hand, you'll feel that island feeling and remember why you chose Hawaii and not Miami (if you come for the same thing as we did).On premise, they have everything you could wish for. My husband even got a haircut and I did yoga close to beach front one morning. It's a small pavillon and only downside is that it's right next to the breakfast terrace and even though they have white curtains to shut off from all the people, it would have been nicer closer to the beach. The yoga instructor was good. I'm not very experienced so he put together a practice that was a perfect mix for all levels.Rooms are beautiful and with huge bathrooms. We could easily ""rent"" a microwave for a fee and we could borrow a baby crip for free. Extremely comfortable beds, spacious rooms (standard sizes and the suites are just two rooms put together) and we had a nice view to the golf course.The microwave ended up being superflouous since we could get oatmeal at the breakfast buffet for our son. The best breakfast ever! Made on the spot omelets, and an abundance of choice - even catering to the Japanese guests. Couldn't list it all even if I tried. Have to mentioned their buttermilk pancakes, though! Don't miss their breakfast if you're there. Maybe at least one morning. At the same restaurant we tried their seafood buffet one evening. Actually, an amazingly high quality of food considering the number of people there and thef act that it was a buffet. Fresh sea food, sushi, a million different stuff. Delicious.See our room tips, for more about the rooms.We did not try the dolphin experience, but (without being an expert) the dolphins seemed quite happy (!!) and the families trying the whole thing looked pleased and happy as well. With our son being so small the (relatively) high prices didn't seem to be worth it.The hotel was top of our list of places we saw in Hawaii, the service, the rooms, the location, the food, the pool (had a very small childrens' pool and the main pool was nice) and everything. Overall the amenities and activities there, including the pool, was great for us. For older kids, it was a great place, but maybe more for relaxing for some days in a quiet spot not in Waikiki. It's not really for adventures onsite - think it's a great spot for exploring Diamond Head, though, and easy going into Waikiki for shopping etc. The dolphin experience might be worth it all for families with older kids. Having mentioned all this about our baby and kids - don't worry, couples and friends (looking for a quiet spot) can have an amazing time here. I remember holidays without kids - and I would recommend it for that purpose anytime. Even if I ever had a chance to come back to Honolulu without kids, I would definitely stay here again.Just go there and splurge and enjoy - it's worth it. (went to Royal Hawaiian - which also seemed nice - and Halekulani - which are comparable in price - would go with Kahala anytime...)","Copenhagen, Denmark","Dinesko</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Copenhagen, Denmark</strong>",25,5.0

The staff of the Kahala Hotel and Resort not only extended hospitality to my partner and I, but exceeded all expectations one can come to expect for a Leading Hotel of the World. In fact, I think we need to create a new word in the English language for their excellent and warm hospitality. After a horrendous stay at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, we were hesitant about the remaining nights of our vacation. After calling American Express for a hotel recommendation and booking, we had a decision to make: the Kahala or Hilton Hawaiian Village. Thank God we chose the Kahala! Immediately upon our arrival to the Kahala we were greeted with a warm welcome by both the valet/bell stand staff as well as a guest servicerepresentative who presented us with a kukui shell lei and a cold towel. The thing my partner and I liked best about the greeting from the bell staff was when we inquired about valet or self parking, he said to go ahead and check in and whatever we decided was fine, he just wanted to spoil us! What a great first impression of a hotel!!! As they say, you never get a second chance at a first impression, and boy did they hit this DIRECTLY on the head. After valeting the car, wewere ushered to the reception desk and after a brief wait we had the privilege and honor to be checked in by Lynn. Of all the hotels I've stayed in( and I do stay in quite a bit of hotels for work... At least 150 nights on the road a year), I've never felt so welcomed at a hotel in my life! It felt like we were returning home and your closest family member was greeting after not seeing you for an extended amount of time. After briefing mentioning our terrible and short stay at the Royal Hawaiian, Lynn checked us in most efficiently and quickly. As she was finishing, she asked us to wait for just a moment. Can you believe she had the Front Office Manager, Tobias, escort us to our room!? What a nice touch! A lot of 5 star hotels will either check youin your actual room or have an agent escort you, but we've never had a manager. After showing us to our room, he gave us his card and personally thanked us for choosing the Kahala and informed us that if we needed anything, he was just a phone call away... What a great change after the Royal Hawaiian. The rooms are quite spacious, dressed in a simple, yet modern elegance. We were lucky enough to have a lanai, as not all rooms have one. Words to the wise, book an ocean view LANAI room or better for nice rooms with a lanai. The bathroomsare also quite large, they all have a separate bathtub and shower... double vanity... two closets... and shelves/drawers. One of our favorite things in the room was the bath robes... They are almost a knit material, which is quite different from your typical terry clothrobes found in most hotels. Recommendations for you stay, be sure to do the breakfast buffet. We definitely had our share plus another families' share! :D. And if you have lunch/dinner at the hotel or room service, be sure to have their fruit salad, which is served in a pineapple half and accompanied with sorbet... My personal favorite flavor of sorbet is their lilikoi, which is Hawaiian for passion fruit. YUM YUM! To summarize, the Kahala hotel is definitely heaven onOahu, if not heaven on Earth.. from the staff to the rooms to the hotel grounds (which are stunning and picturesque- nice for weddings), you can't go wrong staying here. Definitely don't waste your money at the Royal Hawaiian and Hilton Hawaiian Village. Are those hotelscentrally located in Waikiki, yes... but the reason you want to come to Hawaii is for relaxation and peace of mind. Oh, and did I mention they have dolphins and sea turtles at the Kahala?! You can do a group swimming session or individual session... All for the right price ofcourse :). Thank you Kahala, but more importantly thank you Lynn!","New York City, New York","AD361</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",32,5.0

My husband wrote her back immediately and has yet to hear a response (almost a month later). Great management, huh? I grew up staying at the Kahala with my family and have such fond memories of this hotel, which is why my husband and I decided to stay here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and my good health after finishing chemotherapy. Sadly, this is not the same hotel it once was. It breaks my heart to write a bad review of this hotel...though if it leads some of you reading this to stay elsewhere and avoid a disappointing Hawaii trip (didn't even know that could be possible!), then it is well worth it. I'll refrain from commenting about the jack-hammering that ruined our stay since my husband's review (and many other reviews on here) give a great recap. What I will comment on is, that after multiple attempts to get more than a generic apology from management, we have heard nothing. If this was a 3.5 or maybe 4-star hotel, then this review would have a very different tone. But for a 5-star resort that charges what they charge, the resort and the management should be at a 5-star level. Construction noise aside (that was loud enough to be heard through earplugs while sitting on the far end of the beach, btw), here is an overview:Let's start with the good....The rooms are beautiful and luxurious. Even the cheapest room in the hotel is large and well decorated - really makes you feel like you are on vacation. Beds are very comfortable. The maid/room service/wait staff are very nice and attentive. If you have kids, the dolphins are amazing and will keep them entertained for hours. And if you're the type of parents that don't really want to parent when you are on vacation, you can let your kids run around the small-ish resort area (because that's what most of the parents there were doing). Tip: If you don't have kids or don't want to be bothered by other people's unattended kids, I suggest heading far to your left when you get out to the beach. Protected ocean is great for wading and swimming. There are no waves at all, so if you are not a strong swimmer you can safely swim here. Food out by the beach/pool is great - love the soba noodle salad! Had a great meal at Hoku's.The not so good...The pool is SMALL! If you are a pool person, stay elsewhere. It is tiny (think the size you would see in a backyard of a very nice home). Bathrooms by the pool are disgusting. By the end of the day it starts to feel like a Starbucks bathroom in NYC. I think it's from the tour buses of people that get dropped off at the hotel to hang out and watch the dolphins. Breakfast buffet is good, but not great. The fruit I bought in LA when we got home tasted better, and canned peaches at a breakfast buffet at a 5-star resort in Hawaii is unacceptable. And again with the tour-bus drop-off! With only 1 person making eggs, you could wait in line a very long time with the tourists to get your omelette. The host at the Plumeria will actually encourage you to eat breakfast before 8am to avoid this. The beach is not smoke-free and there were many hotel guests smoking. When the breeze picked up, it wasn't so bad, but if you prefer not to breathe in second-hand smoke, the newer resorts are much better about this issue. Thankfully, this was not a problem in our room or at any of the restaurants. If you are like us and grew up coming here in the 80's and 90's, pay attention to the recent reviews! It is not the same management and not the special hotel you may remember. :( Create new memories with your family elsewhere.","Los Angeles, California","ParadiseLost2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",12,1.0

I could only afford a ""Scenic View"" room, even with the advanced purchase promotional discount. The room was still the same nice room as other rooms, with the only difference being the view. I was on a stopover between Sydney and the mainland US so I didn't really need a view for a one-night stay. That said, the view was actually nice - the mountainside behind the resort as well as a nice waterfall on the resort grounds. And, the location within the hotel was very quiet. I was in room 104. The room was very clean and nice and large - especially the bathroom. I had the best night's sleep in this hotel on my entire 11-day journey - the most comfortable bed, and I never had to use my earplugs.I arrived before the designated check-in time, around noon, and my room was available immediately, so I was thrilled with that. The desk staff and bell staff were very friendly and full of information even though I would only be there one day. The resort did not appear to be crowded, though I saw two wedding parties - one each on Thursday and Friday. I was able to find a good chair on the beach no problem, and there is staff in the pool/beach area to set you up with towels and covers for shade.I chose this hotel because it had a private beach area for hotel guests only as well as a shuttle to Waikiki if I wanted to eat in town instead of onsite. I wanted to be able to relax and enjoy the ocean/beach without the Waikiki crowds, and this place fit the bill. Waikiki is always so busy, and I am not a shopper, so I ended up staying put. There were plenty of nice areas on the property to relax. I did not try any of the shopping or the spa available onsite. I also did not try the activities offered, such as dolphin encounters or water sports, as they cost extra $$$.I wound up trying meals in the Veranda, Plumeria Beach House, and the casual beach-area restaurant and all were reasonably good. The Veranda only serves Pupus/Appetizers, but they are good-sized portions and very tasty - the best food out of the three places I tried, though they had a limited menu. The service at the beach-area restaurant was quite slow, and the food seemed to cater mostly to kids (hot dogs, nachos, burgers) but the fish sandwich I ordered was tasty, although pricey. And, I had an early lunch prior to check-out at the Plumeria Beach House that had a nice patio on the beach with great views. The food was fine, but not spectacular - again, pricey but typical for Hawaii. The fourth eatery is the upscale restaurant which I did not try. Overall, I would recommend this place for a more relaxed atmosphere compared to Waikiki. Personally, the view from my room is not very important to me so I wouldn't pay the charges for the upgrades since it is not a nominal fee change to go from the least expensive category up to an ocean front category. On a property like this, I tend to use my room for sleeping, showering, changing, and enjoy the ocean from the beach.","Phoenix, Arizona","phoenixjewel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",29,5.0

Then the next year I booked a partical ocean view, confirmed by the room description, which were, seemed to me, did not have much difference. Although I booked the room more than 6months before the arrival date, my room was disaster... Actually my room was located in the center of the building directly facing the mountain side! The first word my mother told me was, ""where is the ocean!"" Soon I called the front desk, assuming that they must have misunderstood my reservation, however, they told me that was a partical ocean view room! Yeah...., if I look back the ocean side from the balcony, I could see very small part of the ocean (but none from the room). In my perspective, it cannot be called as a partial ocean view room! Actually some other guests had same feelings and I happened to see several guests were claiming the front desk to change the room.However other services were excellent. The Hoku's dishes were awesome. The common facilities of the hotel was very gorgeous.

Before I give my review of the hotel I just wanted to tell people who look at these reviews to take them all with a grain of salt. The week before we came we saw a few concerning reviews. I called the hotel before we arrived and mentioned these to them. Flora the manager who was maybe the nicest and most professional hotel manager I have ever spoke to allayed our fears and did all she could to make our stay perfect. I always read these reviews to see if it would be a good hotel for my family. I was just rereading a few of the negative reviews. One person's negative review was because they pronounced his name wrong, something that he said happens all the time anyway. When you are staying at a resort like this, you expect things to be expensive, so why complain about it. If your grey goose costs 11 dollars and that is a deal breaker for you, don't stay at a 5 star resort. Complaining that you don't have a balcony, when the room you booked is a non lanai room doesn't help anyone.Sorry for the editorial onto my review.This resort is the best of both worlds. You are 15 minutes from the shopping and dining of Waikiki but you feel Worlds away when you are at Kahala. The pool is really nice and they just put beautiful new lounge chairs at pool and beach. There is a ton of staff at pool to help you set up chairs at the beach or pool. No request seems like a big deal. You also don't feel like the staff all has their hands out for a tip. They genuinely seem to want to help you.Our room was an Ocean View Lanai. It was huge, with 2 separate sink areas. The Lanai was very large and the beds were remarkably comfortable. The decor is very Hawaiian and there are flowers all over. The dolphin lagoon is a great thing to have and the beach is great for kids, and there are really no large waves. Our kids took paddle surfing lessons and the staff was more than helpful.I honestly felt like a valued guest at all times. They have a way of making you feel pampered without it feeling overdone or too formal as I have felt at Ritz-Calton's occasionally.People complain about little costs. I loved the fact that they had free coffee and tea every morning for you. They had stuffed Dolphins in the room for my girls when we checked in, and beaded Lei's as opposed to the flower ones which die right away. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough and we are already planning our next trip.","Long Island, NY","arosen15</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, NY</strong>",60,5.0

Let me start with the room. I booked a partial ocean view, so imagine my surprise that our room directly overlooked the hotel driveway and valet station. A full view of the driveway. That should not even be a guest room, let alone categorized as a partial ocean view room at a 5 star resort. We seriously could not even keep the sliding door open because it was that loud. We were in the process of finding another hotel when Rick at the front desk found a room on a higher floor that was actually a nice quiet ocean view room. That was much better, and thank you Rick. The room itself was a little small. As others mentioned, the furnishings are a bit worn. Also, if you have a ""balcony"" rather than a ""lanai"", you will have a ledge with railing, and that's it. This goes back to the whole room description/categorization issue. At this price point, don't pretend that a view of the driveway is a partial ocean view, or that a ledge is a balcony. The room had a wall of drapery, which seemed sort of dusty. Housekeeping was OK, but one day we had only 1 wash cloth. The next day we had only 1 bath towel. Wifi was $15 per day, and it was slow. Do not try to download a movie for your flight home the next day. These are not major issues, but at this price point I do expect to receive a full set of towels every day. And I will say it, if the Holiday Inn Express can provide free Wifi, why can't the Kahala? On that note, the business center will charge you $1 per page to use the printer (though no charge for boarding passes). And be sure to get there between 9 to 5 or you will be out of luck. I mention this because it is Hawaii, and most people will be outside from 9 to 5 enjoying themselves. Other hotels of this caliber have guest key entry to their business centers which allow access when it is convenient to their guests.One thing that seemed a little off was that a seized jewelry auction was being held in one of the ballrooms on Sunday. I peeked in. It was run professionally, but seemed out of place and a little low-rent for this hotel.The private peach is nice. The pool area was pretty nice. The pool service and food were good. All of the common areas were well maintained. Of course the dolphins and turtles are winners. The restaurant Tokyo Tokyo is no longer at the Kahala, so there are only Plumeria and Hoku's. Hoku's is really good, we had dinner there twice. We thought Plumeria could only pull off breakfast. Happy hour was OK, but lunch was just bad. The problem is that you are kind of a captive audience out there, so they should step it up a notch or two. Keep in mind that if you take a taxi to Waikiki for dinner, it is about $50 roundtrip. Also, please do not lie to my travel agent. My travel agent called twice and spoke with the operations manager and was assured that the construction work was finished as of Valentine's Day. We were there over President's Day weekend. As others have mentioned, there is ongoing construction work at the hotel. Yes, you can hear it at the pool. It was not the jack hammering that others have complained about, but there was the sound of power tools and pounding. At least be honest that there is ongoing construction work. While we were there the construction work was right off of the lobby and Verandah area. If you pulled back the curtain, you could see the power tools. That would otherwise be a nice view. All in all, we have mixed feelings about the Kahala. It is beautiful, quiet, and peaceful. Hoku's was great. But, we have had far better all around service and accommodations in Waikiki.","los angeles, ca","julias</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles, ca</strong>",140,3.0

Our room was spacious, had a marvelous ocian view and the bed was first rate. A minor annoyance was the air purifier that greeted us in the room on arrival. Our non-smoking room turned out to have been a smoking room and the hallways also reeked of cigarette smoke. Fortunately we spent all our time with the windows open so we didin't notice the smell in the room.We have stayed at the large hotels downtown and did not miss being there. Instead of the maddening crowds, the hotel is in its own private area adjacent to a lovely residential (high end) neighborhood. That means that the beach and grounds are not overrun by tourists from other hotels. The pool is a bit small, but there were more than enough lounging chairs along the beach that we were never without two together. The dolphin pool is a pleasant attraction.Overall, as reflected in the other comments here, the key is the wonderfully helpful and warm staff throughout the hotel. From the restaurants to the front desk and cleaning staff everyone was welcoming.One evening they could not find our car and we nearly missed our reservations at a downtown restaurant. They called ahead for us (found the car in time) and then left us a bottle of wine and a tray of chocolates with a nice note apologizing for the inconvenience.If you want to be within walking distance of downtown, this is not the place.

Although quite a pricey hotel, its worth the experience. The location of the hotel is away from the centre of Honolulu where all the crowds are, but only a short distance away by car (or free hotel shuttle service every hour). You have your own private beach which is a luxury. There are several places within the hotel to eat, so you have the choice of either ""fancy"" or ""pleasantly ordinary"" for dinner, and the same applies for lunch, with the extra option of a simple BBQ by the poolside/beach. Our favourite was breakfast in the morning which had an open terrace looking out onto the beach and sea - soooo pleasant and relaxing. However you need to get there early as there is a wait for a table (unless you're happy to wait). Breakfast tends to be expensive, so try to get it as part of your package.The rooms are very large and comfortable and you don't feel like you are in a hotel room.The hotel has its own dolphin pool with about 5 or 6 dolphins which is a delight and very entertaining to watch. You are able to swim with them (for some ridiculous fee) but I guess when you're on holiday one tends to over spend anyway.The staff were all very very friendly and made you feel welcome everywhere within the hotel.

Some of the rooms overlook the ""dolphin encounter"" - 5 dolphins live in expansive pools.We were lucky to encounter a ""last minute special"" for a mountain view lanai room with daily breakfast buffet. We do not usually eat a large breakfast, but with the hotel being rather distant from other options we figured it would be worth a try. There was construction at one of the restaurants causing some noise when we viewed the property, which we were told would be coming to an end around the time we were going to be checking out. The mountain room faced away from that area, so we figured we would give it a try. Construction noise was not an issue during our stay.We were very happy with our stay. The room was ready when we arrived at about 1 p.m. with the in-room sound machine playing a relaxing Hawaiian CD. The staff attended promptly to our request for a second luggage rack. We should have asked for a table for the lanai, our room did not have one, but we saw others that did.If you like breakfast buffets, this one is very good, much like what we have had on a cruise ship, with made to order omlettes and fresh waffles. On Sunday, there was a carved ham. It was very good value and we skipped lunch every day and had a minimal evening meal most nights. There was a Friday night Seafood buffet that was excellent - much better than the one we had in Waikiki.Being a bit concerned about animal welfare, we watched the dolphin encounter and were very pleased to see that the dolphins were trained, fed and interacted with throughout every day - no concerns there. The trainers were very professional and seemed to love their work and the animals.The people pool is a bit small and did not seem to be heated, something the hotel should change.The staff were not perfect, but they did seem to try. At the buffets there were sometimes large gaps between the clearing of plates from the table.All in all, we found it an expensive but worth-while four day stay.","Vancouver, Canada","David C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",54,4.0

Both of us had wonderful memories of vacationing at the Kahala with our families as children, and have many friends and family members who cherish their stays at the hotel. Although the near $500 per night room rate was well out of our budget, we thought it would be the perfect ending to an amazing week in Hawaii.We were wrong.When we arrived at the hotel at around noon on Friday, there was complete chaos. Instead of the elegant and tranquil greeting that we had come to expect at most Hawaiian resorts (and certainly at the Kahala), we were welcomed with the most intense jack-hammering I have ever heard (and I’ve lived in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York). We were told at check-in that the noise was temporary, and that the construction was limited to the lobby, and on week-days only. In other words, we were told that we wouldn’t be able to hear the noise from the pool or beach or our room and that it would not last through the weekend. This sounded reasonable enough. Although annoying, if the war-zone pounding were truly limited to just the lobby and only for a few remaining hours that day, well, I could live with that. It would have been nice to learn about BEFORE our stay, but I am a reasonable person and understand that hotels need to renovate.However, claims about the limits of the disruption were simply not true – the noise was deafening throughout the hotel: on our balcony, in the restaurants, at the pool, and clear across the entire beach. We decided to set up shop on the beach as far from the lobby as possible, and, instead of hearing the cool breeze and the ocean, I heard incredibly loud jack-hammering. We were then told that the construction would last ALL WEEKEND. Needless to say, we were furious.Upset and frustrated, my wife and I began calling other hotels to see about spending our last two nights in paradise elsewhere and asked the hotel’s manager to help us. He was actually very friendly, and I believe did the best he could to manage the situation, but all hotels in the area were booked solid for the remaining two nights. The manager upgraded our room and offered resort credit to keep us at the Kahala. We ended up spending about three hours calling other hotels and switching rooms, time we would have preferred spent relaxing by the ocean (again, were it not for the jack-hammering).We endured the disruption all day Saturday and checked out Sunday at around eleven. Every guest we spoke to during our stay was furious. The only Kahala employee that even acknowledged the problem was a very nice evening host at the Plumeria. There was a letter telling us of possible minor disruption that was left after turn-down service - this was laughable. I am a reasonable person and I realize that hotels require construction and ongoing maintenance. However, I think its poor form to not communicate potential disruption, especially one that makes three-quarters of your hotel uninhabitable, and even more so at $500 plus a night. I have a friend that manages several hotels and he was shocked that an establishment of any regard would neither notify nor acknowledge the potential problem. The hotel should either have been closed for the weekend or rates should have been markedly discounted. If we had known of this disruption prior to our stay, we NEVER would have left our timeshare early to visit Kahala. And after our last stay, it will be difficult to lure us back.Again, I have fond memories of the Kahala, and I hope this is not indicative of the hotel’s current management and future direction.","Los Angeles, California","ParadiseLost1978</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",12,1.0
