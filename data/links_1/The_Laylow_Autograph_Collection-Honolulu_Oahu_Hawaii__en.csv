All this owing to the well-designed property and the hospitality of the management team. I was upgraded to a very nice , well-appointed and spacious room on the 15th floor. Whole-panel floor-to-Ceiling window, modern and stylish room design with wide open areas, light-colored carpet and bright-colored furniture (all in excellent condition), looking exactly like the picture at the hotel's website. The room is stark contrast to many of those tiny Waikiki hotel rooms with glum dark-colored carpet and old smelly furniture. Staff were super polite, efficient and professional and appreciated local residents. Bed is indeed on the soft side but still OK. The only problem was that a door handle fell when I tried to close the door; luckily it didn't cause any damage.",,waahi1200,1,5.0

The rooms were very well appointed and spacious. The bed sat a little low but was comfortable once you got in. I would recommend requesting a high floor so u don't hear any noise at night. The outdoor bar and lounge area was really nice with the fire pit. They had local entertainers performing in the evening which added to the laid back ambiance. The flip flops, snacks and water offered in the welcome basket was more than what some other hotels offer in return for the pricey resort fees. The location was perfect for walking to Wakiki beach and shopping and restaurants. The ABC store is right next door and it is right across the street from a very reasonably priced Japanese noodle restaurant. I would definitely recommend staying at the Laylow.",,jlynnredd,5,5.0

The room had two kings and was perfect for our family of four. The hotel is centrally located between the beach and the canal - we also rented a car and the hotel has valet parking which we opted in and out of depending on our plans. Everyone on the staff is very helpful and made our stay comfortable, fun and relaxing. The salt pool was especially nice and stays open late. The only down side doesn't have anything to do with the hotel - it's in a busy part of town so expect street noise. If you can, try to stay in a room on one of the higher floors. Ours had a view of the mountains but the balcony is small and has a better view of the buildings next door.

In short being allocated a noisy room on the third floor and the lacklustre service turned me off this hotel...Despite requesting a higher floor we were on the 3rd floor right above the restaurant. It was so noisy it was distressing and I hardly slept (I used ear plugs and an eye mask). Day bed was not made up - apparently we had to request this specifically even though there were three adults staying - we arrived at midnight so this added to our annoyance.Level 3 is not recommended for car noise, noise from people talking on the street, restaurant noise, music etc. Even though we had a larger corner room (which was why I selected the Laylow) I was willing to give this up for a higher floor. I was even considering moving hotels. I was very disappointed with the lack of concern and service with regard to my concerns; it was explained they were fully booked and had been very busy. I had been given no confidence we could be moved but the next morning we were relieved to be told another higher room would be available however we would have to pack up by 11am and then wait until 2-3pm to get back in. The 10th floor room was so much better. But the lack of service in regard to the situation and no small gesture for the inconvenience was surprising and disappointing. When we moved rooms I got a courtesy phone call, but that was it.The good things...location - close to everything - and style. The restaurant, bar and café are pretty good too.Resort fee and car parking is excessive. Pillows and beds are not comfortable for all.","Wollongong, Australia","Familygdl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wollongong, Australia</strong>",62,3.0

Were he to be incarnated today (vs. reincarnated, since he never actually existed), Don would feel right at home a few blocks away at the Laylow.This hotel is a lot of fun. From the neo-retro style to the friendly folks staffing the hotel, The Laylow is elegant hotel with a distinctive mid-century modern personality and an arch wink. The rooms are nice, albeit cozy and the beds are comfy. I don’t believe I’ve ever stayed in a hotel with a wooden shower (even if it is a simulacrum of timber). It’s not on the famous Waikiki sand, but two blocks away. And yet the hotel boasts it is “Hawaii’s most Instagramable hotel” … and they might actually be right. The food is tasty and there’s a lively bar scene at the “Hideout” packed with soused and sunburnt salespeople celebrating their hard won President’s Club reward trips to Hawaii for exceeding their annual quota. As I said, Don would fit right in.One pet peeve, and not a surprising one from a fellow writing under the moniker “Jittery Eric”: Hotels – including the Laylow – should offer regular, non-elite guests a way to access standard coffee and hot water for tea without waiting in line behind all of the folks ordering specialty coffee drinks. It’s no fun to start a day in paradise jittery and cross. In-room coffee makers and kettles or urns of coffee and hot water in the lobby for a couple of hours each morning should be a basic right. If they can do it at the Hampton Inn and Econo Lodge, they can do it at the Laylow. Even charge for it if you must, or better yet, include it as an amenity covered by the $35 per day, per room “Destination Fee” (not a “Resort Fee because the Laylow is not a resort)!Many guests would likely value coffee and tea over some of the amenities included in the Laylow’s Destination Fee – Hawaiian chips, chewing gum, flip-flop “slippers,” a Laylow rubber duck (a mysterious inclusion given the rooms have no bathtub in which this duck might float), Shave Ice (on select days), Ukulele lessons (on select days), air, etc. – even the singers provided in the Hideout in the evening. Speaking of the singers, they are quite talented and mellifluous. If you happen to be in residence when Keahi Delovio & John Manion are in the house, you might just hear a version of Let It Go (no, not the Frozen one) by James Bay that far eclipses the original. And the best part is that even if you have to leave the set, instead of Muzak, the Laylow streams a live stream of the performance into the elevators.A brief digression about Destination/Resort Fees. I’ve never met a traveler who has expressed enthusiasm about such fees. Some people don’t mind them a jot, but I’ve never heard anyone say, “Gee, this is a terrific hotel, but the amenities are so doggone great I wish they charged me a Destination Fee too.” These fees are here to stay until (1) hotel shopping aggregators TripAdvisor, Expedia, Hotels.com etc. include them in quoted rates as people comparison shop or (2) they are legislated out of existence. Why? Because people say they want and how they behave are inconsistent. Any hotel is at a competitive disadvantage if it doesn’t charge hidden fees when travelers choose based on price comparison with another property that does charge equal fees but displays a lower basic room rate. Taken to its natural apotheosis, soon the room rate at the Laylow will be $35 and the Destination Fee $300. Or more likely, the room rate will be $300 and the Destination Fee $300. It’s all nonsense in the pursuit of RevPAR, but I’m serious about the coffee. A final note: remember to count your blessings. You’re in Waikiki, not Wichita. When’s the next time your oatmeal is going to taste this tropical? The good news is the coffee bar at the Laylow opens at 4 am, so if you are willing to wake up way before the lark, you’ll likely be able to secure caffeine without too much competition.See you at the pool reading my copy of Dante’s Inferno.","Los Angeles, California","jittery_eric</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",45,4.0

Perfect location if you want to be in the center of the action there. It’s designed well, common spaces are nice, rooms are nice, bathrooms a bit small but shower is big. Nice toiletries. This is not a resort, it’s more of a hotel with a small pool that I’ve heard doesn’t get much sun. The beach is a minute walk, but if you’re looking for a resort on the beach with beach service and a big pool this isn’t it. Hotel parking is absurd at $45 a night. There is an enterprise a block away we did daily rentals and returned each night to avoid paying the fee. Staff was lovely.

Location is great as it’s just off the main strip but next door to the international marketplace. At the international market place you can pick up a rental car which is easy and convenient. We rented a car just for each day and at the end of the day instead of worrying about (and paying) for parking we just dropped it back off and picked up a new car the following day. The hotel has a nice restaurant and lounge along with coffee bar. Nice to walk downstairs grab a coffee then go back up to your room. Room decor is so tasteful and very Hawaiian. Loved the little touches like the welcome basket with flip flops. They will lend you beach towels which conveniently have the hotel name printed on them. Shower is very nice great amenities. If you’ve never staying on Waikiki it’s noisy no matter the hotel so don’t complain about the hotel rather be prepared this is a very large city (population 1,000,000). Yes there is cars driving at all hours, ambulance, sirens etc. The check in process was easy. No rooms available for early check in but that’s ok the valet guys take your bags and store them until you have a room. Then they will bring up and deliver your bags. Upon check out we ordered a cab with the front desk and by the time we were downstairs the cab arrived the valet guys scooped up our bags and put them into the cab.

I was there for 3 days and found it pleasant, but the whole hotel is one tall building with a lovely airy open lobby and a small pool area. It isnt a resort.That said, its really beautifully decorated and every interaction with the staff was lovely. The sheer lunacy of ""resort fees"" continues to astound me, but Laylow at least gives you some free flip flops and water to soften that blow. The pool is perfect temperature and well appointed, right next to a small good gym. (NOTE: the pool is in a punchbowl of sorts beneath a garage and the hotel itself, so the sun only warms the area a few hours in the afternoon, which worked well for me, but beware a full day/mroning at the pool would be a waste). As a Bonvoy Gold member, i was a little irked that not only was I not upgraded (no way hotel was full) but i didnt evn get the King Balcony room i ordered- they put me in a Double (and i think every single room has a small balcony, that isnt really a perk). Nevertheless, the room was pretty and the bed was DIVINE. (As luxurious and fresh the sheets/mattress was, the towels were frayed and could use a replacement). Good shower, too.I was here mainly for work, so this was ideal.

Our room felt clean and modern however one of the windows only had a shade that didn’t do the best job of darkening the room which made it a little annoying. The bathroom was rather small only one sink and the toilet isn’t separate which I prefer but did appreciate the larger shower so it’s a trade off. I don’t think I could stay here for a whole week with the bathroom situation it would make it challenging and more time consuming to get ready. We were stocked with plenty of toiletries and towels so we didn’t have to call the front desk after one night and I really loved that. All the staff we encountered was kind and helpful. Otherwise I was very happy with the bed and pillows. I liked the amenity basket with the flip flops and it’s a nice souvenir that is still a reminder of my trip many months later. We didn’t get to use the pool but it seemed nice. I did like the water station set up by the pool that was a nice touch. The area that I would like to see improvement is the hotel restaurant, nothing on the menu is marked gluten free nor did I find the restaurant had many options or perhaps able to accommodate for someone with a seafood and gluten allergies. I ended up eating a salad for dinner which was fresh though not exactly what I was looking to eat but we were exhausted from traveling and not in a state to venture out for food. We decided not to eat breakfast there the next morning as there were more options for my allergies elsewhere. Overall I’d definitely stay here again only a few minor downsides but I do tend to be particular. I liked the location and many places to walk around nearby the hotel convenience store, shopping and restaurants you could possibly get away without a car.

They have a good Happy Hour and two of the bartenders, Taylor and Rei were very friendly and made me feel welcome.

The decor and colors are so Tastefully Done and very Hawaii. Guests are treated to little welcome baskets. In ours we had flip flops, Hi-Chews, Taro chips and chocolate!

Once you order a drink smooze on over to the pool, plenty of seating, it looses the suns rays once it passes over the building, but it provides enough space to lounge relax and dip to cool off if need be. We traveled during the holiday season and their were more kids than adults, which I’ve never encountered in a smaller hotel, but their rooms are supper accommodating. All rooms have a king size bed and if you need a double it is fitted with two king beds. They have a mid modern Hawaiian feel breezy, airy with flashes of contemporary.

The coffee served at the Hideout was terrible - only bought once. We did not eat at the restaurant as the menu was limited and too expensive. We were notified of the New Years Eve party at the Hideout, however, it was for adults, which ruled us out as we had our kids. The room was clean but small. I hated the bed, it was way too soft for me. The other thing that was noticeable - no tea or coffee making facilities in the room. The “Destination Fee” of $35USD per day is also exorbitant!

True, it is not on Waikiki Beach and there is no direct beach access. However, within a few minutes from the hotel's doorsteps, you will be at Waikiki and its loyal throng of voracious tourists. With it being considerably more economical than a Waikiki property, you would be stricken with beach fever if you pass this option up.From the airport, it was about a 20-minute cab ride to the hotel, located rather obscurely by the International Marketplace, an open-air compilation of boutique shops, gourmet eateries, and lovely water features. Beyond the small sign stating LAY LOW, the New York pizzeria, and a dual set of escalators, you would be hard-pressed to know that you had arrived at the hotel.Up the escalators, you reach an open area with a large seating area, two cocoons, as well as Hideout café and restaurant. This was also where the reception and concierge were located. It was a rather small reception area amid the backdrop of hula girls. We arrived around 9:00am and obviously our rooms were not available. By the way, we booked the corner suite with queen day bed and two balconies.When we returned after a full day of sightseeing, we were assigned rooms #1004 and #1015. We were also given a card entitled ""The Perks of Laying Low"" as well as informed that an arrival E Komo Mai basket would be available in each of our rooms. Keep in mind that most Hawaii properties charge a resort fee, so you are in essence paying for all of these extra perks and amenities.After about 15 minutes, the bellboy brought all of our luggage to our room. He was friendly and had a smile on his face, although we wished the service could have been a bit faster.Both rooms were mirror images of each other, just on opposite sides of the hallway on the tenth floor. There was a nicely firm king-sized bed, rather simplistic and on a basic wooden foundation. The backdrop was pinkish wallpaper with green- and pink-colored palm tree designs. There was a comfortable powder-blue sofa bed adjacent to the bed and the ginormous day bed by the room door. There was a small window by the day bed with views of he Honolulu skyline away from the beach. There were also two balconies, one with views of Diamond Head (partial) and a glimpse of the water by the Royal Hawaiian Hotel.There was also a stylish TV rack and cabinet combination piece, with a chair to a supposed work space, two large coffee-table-sized literature, as well as the must-have ukulele. The TV did not have a good selection of programming and given the onslaught of Japanese and Korean tourists everywhere we went, we were shocked that there was absolutely no Asian programming. Behind this unit, there was an actual secluded work station, with sturdy table, bench, and two chairs, as well as convenient plugs. This was located right across from the bar area with ice bucket, ""smart"" fridge, as well as some books to read if we wanted to do so. The welcome basket, which included flip-flops of two different sizes, a bag of taro and sweet potato chips, a bar of dark chocolate, and a stick of Hi-Chew acai-flavored candy, was located on a surfboard-shaped coffee table in between the sofa bed and king-sized bed.We definitely appreciated and admired all of the beachy touches in the room. The light fixture in the separate work station was simply the coolest, although the bellboy emphasized the safety aspect. The stools looked like objects you could find on the beach, and the color scheme of pinks, blues, and bright oranges added to this appeal. The carpeting can be likened to reeds found in the water and there was one token picture of Waikiki by the king bed.The bathroom was of a decent size, with a large oval-shaped mirror, a spacious single vanity, an adequate selection of toiletries, and interesting locations for the tissue box and toilet paper roll. We requested for extra towels but even if we didn't, we would have plenty for our needs. The shower was great, since the sliding door actually closed all the way, unlike most hotel showers that have gaps that cause water to seep out, making the floor wet, although the temperature control was a bit hit or miss. You really couldn't control the water temperature for the shower, cold or hot. Moreover, there wasn't much space between the toilet and vanity, making the bathroom useful for only one person at a time.The one major problem experienced during our stay was the room temperature controls, since on the first night, it was really stuffy, despite lowering the temps to the lower possible degree. It gradually became too chilly but we were unable to raise the temperatures any higher on our last two days there.We did not dine at Hideout since we started each day very early, although we were a bit confused as to why the hotel would advertise coffee and pastry availability at 4:00am daily if that wasn't the case. Only coffee was available. Luckily, there were a myriad of dining options at all hours of the day very close to the property.The bellboy service was very good, very friendly, attentive, almost effortless. The receptionists consistently welcomed and greeted us, which is a bit unexpected nowadays. The pool was a nice touch, although we didn't use it.We would definitely choose The Laylow again in a heartbeat. It was close to all of the action -- great shopping, amazing dining, a short stroll to Waikiki -- and the price was extremely attractive for all of the extras offered. Why pay an arm and a leg for Waikiki access when you can save that money and dine at some of the most coveted establishments in the area, such as Duke's?!

Not sure if lower flowers would have noise issues. Cute welcome basket like others have said -- a really nice touch (two pairs of flip flops, a rubber duckie, large bag of chips, chew candies, and small chocolate bar, and 2 small bottles of water). I hope they never do away with it. Not much of a pool area but that's to be expected since it doesn't fare the ocean (which is right across the street). The pool is actually quite nice for what it is, but I didn't come to Hawaii to lounge at the pool when the ocean is right there. Bar area is nice, sort of a balcony open area. Didn't try the restaurant as there are plenty of options.My only ""complaint"" is that the bed is really soft -- I'm more used to the Westin/ Sheraton type bed. Maybe it's b/c I had the handicapped room -- which I voluntarily take b/c it's on a higher floor than what I was offered (basically just a lower bed, handheld shower option, and a pull out bend in the shower --no bathtub). I didn't ask until the third day if there's something that can be done about the bed -- like putting a hard board at the bottom. The front desk said it would call housekeeping. Never heard from anyone. If I had asked for this right away, I would have followed up, but as it was, I didn't bother. Anyway, not a huge issue but I wonder if the beds here are all that soft. This is the only negative for me and I would certainly come back. Closet area all pretty tiny -- it was fine as it was only me, but could be tight for two people. Again, not sure if the non handicapped room would be different. Didn't try the gym but for a hotel this size, it looks decent.

We got upgraded to the exec floor - so they also had an espresso machine and different small snacks (croissants, cookies, mixed nuts) throughout the day. The rooms were huge (for the area) and we had a partial ocean view (between buildings) with a nice balcony. The hotel is also within walking distance of everything Waikiki has to offer. I used to always get a car but with parking now what it is down there, it is actually cheaper to just take a car to/from the airport if you aren't going anywhere else on island.We also had a chance to try the restaurant for lunch - it was a little pricey but the food was really good and it had a nice vibe.

Our family of mom, dad, and 4 little girls had a marvelous time at this luxury hotel. What stands out first and foremost is the exceptional service. Everyone at the Hideout restaurant, front desk, and the valet stand really did a tremendous job ensuring that our needs were met. I commend the staff for their attention to detail and proactivity. It was highly impressive how folks went above and beyond and tried to think of how to offer ""extra.""Here's an example -- there is a lovely pool and good fitness facilities where complimentary fruit is offered. Early one morning, I got an apple to feed the girls prior to breakfast since they were complaining of being hungry. I went to the restaurant to see if they had a real knife for me to use in order to slice the apple. Upon requesting the knife, Ashley C perceptively asked if I needed it cut (to which I answered yes), and she went to the back room to get it sliced. Then, she came out with a takeout container with it cut, and 4 little peanut butter containers since she thought the girls might like that. WOW. They did obviously, and I am so appreciative for her forethought and initiative. Every single time, the entire staff was proactive in their thinking, and accommodating of our requests -- really excellent service!!In addition to Ashley C, Edgar, Rita, Cindy, Ashley and Ben the general manager were amazing, helpful, and friendly. We mostly ate breakfast meals at the hotel -- favorites were the French Toast with Nutella and the salmon with pesto and toast. The flatbread pizza with truffle is also fantastic. The valet staff was terrific. Harold, Christopher, Matt, (name escaping me...starts with A) were all incredibly quick to get our 13 passenger van and super accommodating. Front desk staff ensured everything was well explained and taken care of.The location is right in the heart of Waikiki. The rooms were beautiful. The beds were very comfortable.

The staff are very friendly, the rooms are a great size, the coffee in the lobby is excellent and there are fun touches like free shaved ice daily between 2-3pm, free flip flops and ukelele lessons. Despite this, I was disappointed by our Laylow experience. I am a Marriott Bonvoy member and had booked our two adjoining rooms directly with the hotel. When I booked I asked for our rooms to be on a high floor, mindful of reviews here about noise. I also requested an early check in as we were arriving about 8am, though I was aware that might not be possible.As it turned out we had to wait, drooping in the foyer after an overnight flight, until 2.30pm for our room. Guaranteed check in time is 3pm so that wasn't exactly early. Another day I noticed another family waiting to check in (they had to wait half an hour) and they were offered free pineapple to snack on. We were offered nothing. And as for the high floor - we were on level 6, of 16. Reception is level 2. So my requests amounted to nothing. And I understand that happens but it would have been nice if we at least had been given an apology. The only explanation was that there are not many connecting rooms, but if people have to check out by 11am why did it then take 3.5 hours for our room to be ready?Our connecting rooms had no view whatsoever, were quite noisy from the airconditoning in the International Marketplace and also from loud amplified music in the bar area until 10pm on at least two nights. The kind of loud music that earplugs doesn't drown out.Our rooms were stylish and clean. However they were also poorly lit at night, short of hooks in the bathroom for towels (if you have only two hooks and one rail, how do you hang two bathtowels, a facecloth, a hand towel and a bath mat?) and the pillows were hideous: overly large and overly stuffed. I found the bed quite comfortable but it is on the softer side, my husband hated it.Also a security bug: you need to use your room key to access your floor in the lift. But anyone can enter the stairwell from the lobby and access every floor in the building that way.The pool area as others have pointed out is very small (and shallow, only 3"" deep) - quite often there was no seating available at all.I realize this all sounds highly critical. It IS an appealing hotel, we loved the look & feel and we loved the location. But we never felt particularly valued to the staff and that noise - even requesting particular room types in advance doesn't guarantee that you will get a quiet room. So it's a guarded recommendation from me.Protip #1: if you want to order things online and have them sent to the hotel before your arrival, this is possible. I noticed a small pile of packages waiting for guests to arrive.Protip #2: Overnight parking is $45 but you can park overnight in the parking lot round the corner on Sunset (next to Ross) for only $32 or for free alongside the canal one block to the east.",Sydney,"kiwicmc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",22,3.0

If anything, I was surprised it wasn't more expensive.I'm not one for huge resorts that feel impersonal. So the fact that the bartenders remembered my name, and the person working the coffee bar remembered what I had gotten the morning before, was lovely. The hotel has a shop with some cute local goods. Obviously nothing is ""cheap"", but I also wouldn't say that the items were unreasonably priced. The drinks and food were really tasty. It all seems to be carefully crafted, which is again something I appreciate in a ""boutique"" hotel. The only thing I noticed was that the service at the pool was a little slow. However, it's a 20-step walk to the coffee bar and restaurant host stand if you really wanted to put something in. I'm a huge coffee snob, so the Hideout coffee bar was a dream to me.

It is in a busy area which is both good and bad. You're right in the middle of everything. If you want to feel a little more 'away from it all' this is probably not a good choice. I also agree with the last couple of reviews mentioning a slow bar and lack of recognition for Bonvoy members. This feels more like a hip boutique hotel (positive) but your Bonvoy status isn't going to get you much (negative). It's a fun alternative to the large hotels right on the beach.

Honestly, I LOVED The Laylow - from the rooms, hotel amenities, in-room welcome basket, bathroom products, onsite restaurant (expensive but good quality) and most importantly their staff. In particular I want to commend the following staff for making my 9 day stay even more enjoyable as follws: Alahi and Hokulani (Front Desk), DJ (Pool Attendant), Edgar and Daisy (Hideout Restaurant). My only suggestions for travelers is to try to get a high floor only because many of the lower floors do not have any views of the ocean and if you are a pool person like me, get to the pool early as there are limited lounge chairs on the deck. The pool has regular chairs and water lounges that seem to always have availability. Also, the sun doesn't seem to hit the deck until 11:30-12:30 so if you want sun walk to the beach (one block) and then come back later.

Looked cool and good location. The shave ice was really good and helped us cool down. The pool was small and intimate and perfect to just hang out. It was what we were looking for. The international marketplace is right there so lots of shopping and food options. Staff of hotel was good and helpful and really nice. The bartendars were not the most helpful and I had to flag them down to get a drink even at slow times. But still overall was decent enough in service. Cons:The bed was lopsided. After the first night I woke up the next morning feeling un rested and my back felt sore. But kids were excited and we headed out first thing in the morning and spent the whole day swimming and hanging out in Waikiki. Came back after dinner exhausted and was ready to go to bed. The kids were in bed and when I jumped in the bed I realized the left side was lower than the right side. I asked my wife to jump on the bed and she said it was lopsided. At that point I was going to call to switch beds but the kids were sleeping so I just slept on the bed and woke up unrested again but we were checking out and going back home. At this point I probably would have still gave 3 stars since the hotel stay was great, amenities were as expected and the lopsided bed probably minused one star. When I came home I recieved an email on a survey. I participated and expressed how the bed being lopsided was bad and I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone else to sleep on. I mentioned in the survey that I wanted to be contacted via email due to the lopsided bed. No one ever responded. If you are going to have me do a survey on my stay and ask for my opinion then at least follow thru and reach out to me. Not sure if hotel manager gets these survey. If they do then I fault them for not getting back to me. If the hotel managers never get the survey then what is the purpose of having us take them. And because of this I gave a 1 star as this is a service based industry and if Marriott doesn’t take it seriously then they will lose customers because of this.

To get enough sleep being away from home, I typically ask for silent rooms. I did the same in the laylow at the pre-checkin at 8:30 am of the day of arrival, coming back for the checkin at 6pm (doing a day tour in between). What we got is a room directly facing a parking space, on the same floor, with loud music and a constantly working air airconditioning of a shopping center next door, with the elevators in front of the room and a door to our neighbors. I asked for a change after I saw the room, but no way. Really? That is the worst experience I have had in years. After coming from a perfect experience at the Hyatt Waikiki Beach, this is even more disappointing, considering that this hotel is more expensive and much worse located. Just the interior is better, as newly renovated. I do not recommend this hotel, if you like a good night sleep in your holidays.

Living on Oahu, The Laylow Hotel is a perfect staycation hotel. My apartment had water damage that initially needed two-weeks for repairs. The repairs ended up taking five and a half months, from March to September 2019! My initial feeling was stressed to be living out of a suitcase, but the staff made it easy to adapt to the situation.The Laylow is located on Kuhio Street, one street inland from the busy Kalakaua Avenue and almost half way between the Waikiki stretch. I was able to walk instead of dealing with traffic and parking. There is a market next door for any needed essentials, shopping, and restaurants. The Laylow is a smaller intimate boutique hotel that is able to maintain a hospitable environment. The staff consistently provided me with unexpected personal attention that made this stay feel like a second home. Off of the bustle of Waikiki, you take a ride up the escalator and enter tropical sanctuary. There are multiple seating areas surrounded by lush greenery. From this area you can access the pool/gift shop/gym area, the front desk, and the Hideout coffee, restaurant and bar. From my check-in to the multiple extensions, to checkout, the front desk was always very helpful in making the changes and accommodating any needs. The entire front desk staff were all very welcoming, especially Joey who greeted me by name every time I left or returned to the hotel. In a conversation about coffee, he offered to have a coffee maker sent to my room. I was given two complimentary coffees/teas to make a day. This was an unexpected convenience for me for those rushed mornings before leaving for work. I didn’t have to worry if there was a line for coffee in the lobby.My Laylow room was on the 10th floor and comfortable with a midcentury style and the right touch of Hawaii detail. A welcome basket and a note was in the room with snacks, bottled water, a cute Laylow duck, slippers (flip flops), and $50 activity credit that can be used with the concierge. The room had a mini fridge, built-in style furniture along with books, fun décor, and a ukulele for those of you who are musically talented. The hotel also offers ukulele lessons you can sign up for held in the lobby! Rooms also have a reading area and balcony for another relaxing space. I loved having the plush robe after using the large walk-in shower and lounging. After earning enough Marriott rewards points I was able to upgrade to a 12th floor corner junior suite. This room was very spacious having two balconies, and two sitting areas. During my entire stay at the Laylow, I rarely spent time in the rooms. I almost felt like I was missing out on enjoying the corner suite, but Waikiki has so much to do rather than stay in the room! The housekeeping staff was also always consistent in the cleanliness of the rooms, leaving a sufficient supply of toiletries, and accommodating any needs I had. I liked how they came during work hours too!Another favorite is the saltwater pool with submerged lounge chairs along one side, comfortable cushioned lounge chairs with overhead moveable shades, and two cabanas. They also have fruit infused water and fresh fruit available daily while relaxing in the sun. Around midday, a pool server stops by and gives mocktails and a menu for easy ordering drinks and/or food. The Wagyu Mainlander Burger and fries was perfect for lunch at the pool, followed by a 1:00 pm complementary shave ice! The pool attendant DJ was always attentive in welcoming me to the pool, and providing me with sunglass wipes. Love those! There is also gym access from the pool area open 24 hours. The gym also has fruit infused water, fresh fruit, towels, and ear buds to use with the machines. They have a variety of equipment for any level of workout you might desire during your vacation. In the early morning hours, I had the gym to myself!The valet was another plus for me during this extensive stay. I was always greeted with a smile and by name. They knew my work schedule and had my car pulled up front before I came down from my room. Even when they got busy during peak times, the valet team made sure my car was near. The entire valet team was friendly and made it a point to be aware of my schedule. In the morning the Hideout coffee bar was a friendly bonus where I could grab a coffee and order a great acai bowl. They also have fruit and bars to grab for on-the-go mornings. Maryann greeted me frequently and offered me a stamp card where you earn a free coffee after nine stamps. I was able to earn a lot of free coffees during my stay!The Hideout Restaurant and Bar was my go-to spot for many snacks, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and drinks. Managers Roberto and Ben do a fantastic job to ensure the Hideout is run smoothly. They regularly check in with guests and have welcoming personalities that make them easy and fun to talk to. The Hideout environment is laid back with stylish décor that makes you want to hang out forever. The energy is always fun! I especially liked how there are no televisions in this space, this forces patrons to be more social and enjoy the moments. During my time at the Hideout I met many interesting people from locals, to business travelers, to vacationers. In fact, I still keep in touch with some of those people. In the open-air rooftop style area, there are two large fire pits on each end and lounge seating. Local music artist begin to play at 7:00 pm every night and allows the crowd to feel that intimate, yet exciting venue. They also have a DJ play for the weekend nightlife vibe. There aren’t many places in Waikiki that provide fun live music nightly.This was a fantastic spot to go to unwind after work and enjoy happy hour or dinner. They have a menu with a variety of Pacific-Rim style choices. My favorite appetizers are the poke tacos and Pork Belly Brussel Sprouts. The Manchego & Truffle Flatbread is yummy and the Asian Pear/Bacon jam flatbread with a glass of Pinot Grigio is the perfect combo! The Hideout also features a fresh catch fish dinner that the chef prepares perfectly with your choice of a recommended sauce. Other favorites are the Poke and/or Chicken Rice Bowl, Miso Spinach Salad add Chicken, Coconut Curry Seafood, and the Mango Smoked Chicken. These are healthy portions that can be shared. All of the meals I had were consistent in preparation and service.Lindsey bartends in the morning and I was able to enjoy his spicy Bloody Mary drinks with a breakfast burrito or avocado toast. Rae, Justin, Tyler, Sheena, Matt, Julie, and Atticus bartend in the evenings and I always looked forward to talking to them. They are all very personable and take time to get to know the people who sit at their bar by name. There were times where they would have my glass of wine ready as I walked towards them! Although my norm is a glass of Rose or Pinot Grigio, I’m also a gin drinker, but picky about the brand. Justin took time to make me a fancy gin cocktail that I was able to add to my favorite gin list. The consistency of the staff for my long stay says a lot about how the staff is treated by management. I am under the impression that the Laylow staff is an extension of their own ohana. During this extensive time I was able to have both friends and family stay at the hotel or visit to enjoy the Laylow with me. It’s now become their favorite too! Mahalo to the Laylow staff for creating a home-away-from-home for me! I’ll be seeing them all again soon :)",,Tara S,2,5.0

So we decided to do some reconnaissance. The moment we walked into the hotel we were great greeted by Rachel at the reception desk who gave us the details of the hotel invited us on a quick tour and encouraged us to have a bite and a drink at the bar. She just had so much aloha we couldn’t help but feel right at home and then our food and drinks were amazing.It was quite a first impression and thankfully our stay, rather than challenging that impression actually confirmed it; the LayLow will be our go-to spot from now on, it is conveniently located between Kuhio and Kalakaua avenues so you can feel part of the action or just distant enough to keep the relaxing vibe. So how did we spend our time do you ask? Sitting at the pool drinking amazing cocktails and lounging around doing absolutely nothing during the days then in the evening cruising Waikiki, dancing and having an amazing time.

We stayed in a Ho‘okipa Level Corner Suite. Upon arriving in my room, there was a bottle of champagne with a super cute note from the hotel wishing me a ""Happy 40th Birthday!"" The room is perfectly laid out: spacious enough for hanging out with friends, catching some sun from the lanais and had the most comfortable bed, and day beds. We had 4 people staying in the room without it ever feeling crowded and like we each had our own space. The room amenities were great: a welcome basked filled with local goodies, an empty mini-fridge (definitely a plus when you're staying multiple nights), and perfectly scented toiletries.Upon check-out, Summer and Suzanne helped us quickly through the process.

The hotel is in great condition, has live music at night, a bar onsite, and a salt water pool. The pool area was a good size and didn't ever look over full. There is a daily resort fee which came with a few perks like a welcome gift basket that had snacks and sandles. The resort also had towels to take to the beach and a few other benefits. The only disappointmeant was some of the benefits were very time limited like the shaved ice. It would have been better as a serve yourself setup then a specfic and limited time window. The room and bed were comfortable with a dedicated sitting area, large tv, and small balcony.Pros:Staff was very receptive and kindRooms and hotel were in great shapeOnsite barConvenient access to shopping, rental cars, and foodCons:Resort fee was a bit too high and the benefits very time limited.

Even though I had to call Chase several times, the Laylow staff were super patient and understanding and always had a smile while trying to solve my issue. I also requested to move my room since my view was the parking lot. Even though there was not a suite available until the next day, I gladly waited to move because Gabrielle the manager made me feel so welcome and taken care of. Special thanks to Summer and Gabrielle. Thank you for making my stay amazing and always providing me the best customer service. I will definitely be back because of the staff and service! FYI, all junior suites are next to the elevator but you wont hear the commotion from the elevator because of the configuration of the room.

Location- central. Easy walking distance to shops, restaurants, 24 hrs convenience stores, laundromat, beach. Hotel also provides bicycles for free which we used to bike to the nearest Crossfit box for 3 mornings. And to Ala Moana Centre too. Room - really tastefully done. Mid century Nordic designs in wood and a warm green / teal colour. Accented with drawings of palms on the wall paper, sand design echoed on pool towels, flip flops given to us, etc. Quality and sturdy furniture that still looks good despite all the stays. Bathroom is well designed. Showers have wood tiles so feels warm to be in there. No view of the water and get a room on the high floor. 15 or 16th. Not rooms by the pool. It gets really noisy early. Big surprise- along the corridor is a self service station with a great coffee machine (really good coffee with all kinds you can think of. Even the regular black coffee has a great cream!). There are also 3 kinds of water on tap! Snacks like assorted nuts, fruits like oranges and green apples. In the afternoon, there maybe be cookies or something sweet up for grabs. In the mornings, they put out pain au chocolat, cinnamon rolls, etc. It’s a great pick me up place and I’ve never been so excited to get to a corridor to see what they have put out! Restaurant- had dinner there once, and a small breakfast. Menu is limited and in the evenings, it’s a big hangout place for the local hipsters with live music. So it gets noisy. Overall, I’d recommend it. ","Shanghai, China","BuddhaFleur</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",169,5.0

Excellent location. We stayed on the corner suite on level 7. The room size was excellent. Our kids shared the day bed (which was the size of a double bed). Pillows were somewhat disappointing to my liking. We arrived early at 10.30am to check in and were told that a room wasn't available, but if a room did become available, it would cost $50 (for an earlier check in). I've never heard of any hotel who charges a fee like this before (maybe its a Hawaiian custom?). They took our contact details and the reception advised that they would contact us if a room became available before the 3.00pm check in time. We decided to leave our bags in their storage to grab an early lunch and a wander of the surrounds until the check in time of 3.00pm. We decided to head back to grab a drink at the Hideout at 2.00pm. We also queried reception if any rooms were available and were advised yes (so much for reception contacting us as previously advised). There wasn't a $50 early check in fee as we were within the hour.So after the drink at Hideout we handed our storage tags to reception who then passed the tags on to the Porters (so they could retrieve our luggage). 1 hour 25 mins later, our bag hadn't arrived. By this time I made 2 x follow up phone calls and even went back downstairs to where the luggage was stored to grab the luggage myself...only to be told that it was already sent up to my room. I beat the porter to my room by a furthet 5mins. Frustrating after a 9hr flight.Overall, rooms were clean, it could get abit noisy for those on the lower floors above the bar due to the live music every night.

I had been to Hawaii a few times but not in over 10 years and he had never been. Generally I’m not a fan of going to big cities on vacation so in other circumstances I would have skipped Waikiki and gone straight on to our Kauai vacation but since we had to fly into HNL anyway and my husband wanted to see Pearl Harbor we decided to stay for a few nights. I dithered on which Marriott Bonvoy property to stay at, of which there were many as I had enough points for 3 nights at any of them, including the Ritz. Ultimately I decided to book the Laylow after reading all of the reviews here and the allure of the boutique style hotel that wasn’t a massive resort with hundred of kids on the already over crowded Waikiki beach. I have stayed at Marriott properties all over the world and this was by far one of my favorites. The location is perfect, the service is top of the line and the food and drinks at the open air restaurant are the best I’ve had at a hotel. Highly recommend the fish tacos and the Catch the Vibe cocktail. The welcome amenities and everything that comes with the resort fee are such a nice touch as well - flip flops, water, snacks in your room and the fee covers all of the usuals plus daily pool side cocktail, snack, shave ice, and a credit for an activity.

On a recent trip to Honolulu, we decided to stay at the Laylow Hotel, which is part of the Marriott Autograph Collection. One word sums this hotel up nicely, “Fabolous”. From check in to check out, we experienced great service, and a welcoming spirit. The Laylow has a fantastic restaurant and bar. Excellent food and drinks, at very reasonable prices. Tiki torches and fire pits set the Hawaiian atmosphere and ambiance in the evening. No need to go anywhere else from this all inclusive hotel. This hotel is highly recommended. Fantastic rooms with a welcoming basket are icing on the cake. Now for some constructive criticism that will move this hotel from 4 star to 5 star. The pool and deck are very small. It is a very nice pool and deck, it just happens to be tiny. My observation is that many of the local residents/children from surrounding neighborhoods , use the pool each day. Not sure why, when you have the most beautiful beach in the world right here for free at your 24/7 disposal. There is no room check/resident confirmation at the pool so it’s basically a free for all for anyone that wants to use it. People just walk right past the “Pool for Hotel Guests Only “ sign. The number of non-residents using the pool is incredible. This makes it very difficult for residents of the hotel to find a place to sit, and use the very small and crowded pool. The recommendation is for those wanting to use the pool to be channeled through the gift shop area where pool users are asked to show a wristband (need to implement this/wristband) by a designated employee. This check should be implemented from 1 June- 1 October (busy season).Other than that, we enjoyed our stay immensely, and would certainly recommend this hotel to all needing accommodations in Honolulu.Mahalo !","Naples, Florida, United States","MajorS812</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naples, Florida, United States</strong>",52,4.0

Also good shopping malls.Room was very well appointed , very comfortable bed and nice complimentary basket of goodies , including flip flops . We had one on the 15th floor which we paid extra for. There is a counter for hot drinks and cold water on this floor but not sure this perk is worth the money. We had a side on sea view( all views are side on) but the balconies are very small and felt precarious to see the sea so I would say don’t bother troubling your self to pay for it. The hotel has a small pool which looks very smart but there is not much seating so hit and miss if you can get a sun bed. It gets sun in the pool area for about 3 hours each day otherwise it is in shade. They gave complimentary shave ice and the odd drink during the day.

It is a pretty average hotel, with the rooms on both sides of the hotel overlooking parking garages, which is really disappointing when you enter the room after landing in a tropical paradise. The rooms are clean, which is good, but they are basic. If you are looking for a lowish cost hotel in a great location, that is good enough for a family vacation, then this may work for you.

We usually stay at the Turtle Bay Resort, Aulani and The Kahala, but have also stayed at the Marriott, Embassy Suites, Waikiki Parc and others. I had been interested in the Laylow. I was intrigued by the retro Hawaiian decor at this Marriott Autograph hotel and really liked the idea of two king beds. I was a bit hesitant when it first opened, but decided to give it a try a few months ago.Verdict: We loved it! I would not hesitate to return, as a matter of fact - we will be returning later this month. The location is perfect. It is in Waikiki, but away from the noise and a very short walk to the best part of Waikiki Beach. The renovated beautiful International Market Place is next door. It was an easy walk thru the International Market Place, cross the street, go thru a lobby and we were at the beach. The hospitality was wonderful. Every staff member that we interacted with was very polite and helpful. If you lucky enough to run into the manager as we did, you will find a very polite person who is truly interested in giving you a wonderful unique experience. His staff reflects this.The rooms are brand new, clean and the decor is delightful. We enjoyed having a ukulele in the room and a wonderful selection of books to read. The books were really great selections about the history of Hawaii, culture, architecture and the Hawaiians. All carefully selected. You can see that lots of thought went into selecting these books, which is true for every detail in the room. There is no detail that has been overlooked even the straws in the coffee bar have that retro look. if you have an interest in retro Hawaii, you will be in paradise. We loved that the TV had Netflix and we were able to watch the finale to one of our favorite shows.The room was very quiet. We never heard anyone next door nor in the hall and we were right across from the elevator, but never heard a thing.Every morning we had fantastic coffee at their coffee bar. They have the very delicious and hip Stump Town coffee from Portland, Oregon. We tasted amazing cappuccinos and Lattes every morning and enjoyed their pastries. No need for a Starbucks!We spent an evening at the outdoor lounge, The Hideaway and very much enjoyed our time drinking some of the best mai tais in town with delicious appetizers. Don't miss the appetizers. They are excellent. The Hideaway is a popular place. Live music is performed and the breeze up there is great.Other highlights were being across the street from Marakume Udon. It has the best udon. We ate there twice. FYI: best time to eat there without lines is 10:00am or 3:00pm. Expect a wait if it is any other time, but totally worth it. Get a piece of fried chicken to go with it, you’ll thank me later.The top floor of the International Market Place has lots of upscale dining options. They are all beautiful and very temping. I suggest a visit to the IMP to check it out for yourself. If you are on a budget, then turn left and next door you will find Duke’s Lane Market and Eatery where you will find some great dining options and a large ABC market with food and drinks. We ate at Ono Burgers twice on our trip. Fantastic! Look down the alley and you will find the absolute best place on the island to purchase souvenirs. there are dozens of vendors selling everything you could possibly want. Don’t miss checking them out!Our stay at the Laylow was fun, exciting, comfortable, refreshing and it is a most welcomed new hotel on Oahu.

The first full day, our room [corner junior suite w/ king bed and queen day bead] was bridesmaid ""get-ready"" headquarters. The room was chic, clean and spacious enough. The other two nights, I stayed with my husband for a little 'staycation' since our honeymoon wasn't immediately after the wedding. As kama'aina I love this hotel and will stay again. Nearly every employee we interacted with was stellar and had amazing guest service skills. The food at the restaurant/bar was tasty and the drinks were unique. The pool area is relaxing and very cute. The location is convenient and walking distance to many of the Waikiki attractions. The prices are very reasonable and I feel like I got my money's worth. Clearly, there are a plethora of good things to say about this place!For the sake of review, there were just a few things that could be improved, but definitely not enough to deter me from staying again:1) Our mini-fridge didn't seem to maintain a consistent, cold enough temperature. Some of the things I put in there were not always cold enough to the touch when I took them out. The temperature gauge randomly fluctuated from 35 degrees to 44 degrees.2) There is only one place to get ice, in an ice chest on the lobby level near the pool. I think a few more ice chests on a couple of floors would be a little more convenient. Also, I couldn't seem to find any signage on where to get ice in my room or in the hallway outside my room, so I called down front desk and they let me know.3) There was only one employee working poolside [taking drink/food orders] on the day we went to the pool. Though it wasn't overwhelmingly busy that day, it seemed like a lot for one person to handle. We would have ordered more had she made it to us sooner [between her running back to input the orders and running the orders out, it took about an hour for her to get to us]. I don't necessarily fault her with this, however I do think they should staff at least 2 people to work poolside.","Wahiawa, Hawaii","GenesisCL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wahiawa, Hawaii</strong>",3,4.0

She made a point of introducing herself, asking our names etc. After that first night, she always greeted us with a friendly smiled, asked about our day and remembered what we preferred to drink. She was great, The only negative I would mention was that our room was never cleaned before 4pm and on two nights we had to request towels so that we could shower & get ready for dinner. One of those nights our room did not get cleaned at all because we had to put the do not disturb sign on the door so that we could get ready for dinner. When the room was cleaned, it was done well. No complaints about the cleanliness, just would have preferred that it was done during the day while we were out exploring the island.","Malta, New York","Nicole R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Malta, New York</strong>",45,5.0

The location is great. It’s at the center of everything in Waikiki and just one block from the beach. We like the boutique feel of The Laylow over the larger beach resorts. That said, although the location is amazing, your room won’t have a great view. We spend so little time in our room that the view is a non issue. We like the cute decor, the fun welcome basket, daily shaved ice, the nightly music, and the pool (which is tiny) but great for our small kids. I also love that the lobby is elevated from the street which makes the hotel feel like even more of an oasis from the Waikiki crowds. If you’re looking for a smaller Waikiki option- this is a great one! Will stay at The Laylow again!

Last time at Laylow for me.Example: I asked for a late 4pm checkout and was told it was guaranteed, but as I came back to my room at 3:30 to take a late shower, I was told that my room now was occupied by a new guest and housekeeping had cleaned my room at 2:45pm.

From the moment the cab drops you at the valet, you feel welcomed! Service, is stellar! I love the escalator up to checkin. It’s like leaving your travel day behind you as you are elevated to another level. Most importantly the warm ohana feeling the staff greats you with is impressive. In an era of low unemployment, I think hotels have suffered an apathy that is palpable with the most staff. Not here, they are attentive, interactive and actually offer service! We were very impressed having traveled extensively for work, and pleasure it was refreshing.This is a reflection of good management, it is a a general manager who is engaged and focused on guest experience and his/her staff as well. So well done! We stayed in a corner king and the room was FANTASTIC! Lots of room. It is in the heart of Waikiki just a block from the beach and right on the main drag. Saltwater pool is relaxing and on the main level. This high rise building it is not without views but Waikiki is dense. The upper floor where we were offers an espresso machine and am croissants. We loved that. Shopping, dining and easy access to all thing Honolulu are right out the door. This is a must stay location. Had we known how great this place was, we would have booked a whole week here and not gone to the North Shore. We liked the mix of clients here too. Families, couples, hipsters, and business travelers alike. Breakfast was great and the wait staff was fabulous. Loved the bar and nightly music. Their cocktails were creative, unique and FUN!!!! We started every night out there and then ventured to a nearby restaurant for dinner. Loved the Guacomami it is a perfect appetizer. We will be back. Aloha and Mahalo for a great stay!

But view was of other high-rises. Hotel is deluxe in every way but jammed into the high-rise city. The. open-air restaurant on 2nd floor was super. Great for breakfast.

There was a dining nook so you don't have to eat on the bed or day bed and the bathroom/shower are roomy. The king bed was super comfy and the room was decorated with really nice post-modern furniture. I really liked the random books in our room, one which stands out was the Hawaiian Survival Handbook. The welcome basket had great snacks and cute slippers to wear to the pool! They also have a mini-fridge and refill the bottled water daily. It's a great location, right next to international market place, and walking distance to other great shops/eateries. The Hideout had great food and drinks.

Good restaurant with an interesting breakfast menu. Excellent service - Kaitlin made sure I had a kettle and some teabags to help with my cold and Richard is a personable and knowledgeable concierge. I was in a room that faced a parking garage, not the pool, but I suspect it was quieter. The only noise issue I had was slamming doors very early. My room on the 7th floor was next to a storage type closet which seemed to get a lot of use in the early hours. I would give 5 stars except for two important reasons: my mattress was very uncomfortable - little back support - needs replacing. And it has been a long time since I stayed in a hotel that did not have a coffee tray setup in my room. Waking up with a back ache AND no coffee was problematic.

The place is picture perfect - every corner is beautifully styled with lush plants, unique art and paintings, and modern design. When we arrived, the concierge was super helpful in getting us checked in, noticed we were SPG members, and kindly upgraded us to a room on the 16th floor. This was preferable to us over a room by the pool, as it was higher up, less rowdy from the bar and pool noise, and the floor had complimentary coffee, water, and snacks. This was perfect because the mornings came with a pastry or a ham and cheese croissant, and evenings had cookies!The rooms are beautiful and comfortable, the furniture was well kept in great condition. We also loved the toiletries including the soap and hair product in the bathrooms, we were tempted to take the leftovers home! The only drawback here was the loud air unit in the room - most nights this was fine, but a couple of nights it kept us up with a whirring and whistling sound which was quite annoying. We would absolutely stay at the Laylow again, however, I think I would be sure to request a room without the noisy air unit, and I think that if they had more incentive to welcome guests to the Hideout - say, with a happy hour or a complimentary bev upon arrival - it would have been perfect.

Our family of four, including two young adult sons, stayed for a week in a corner suite on the 10th floor facing Kuhio Ave. The room is comfortable and large enough for four people. It has two large king beds and two day beds which are a great plus to have, as is the sitting area with a small table and chairs. A small fridge came in handy to store some food for breakfast and snacks. The bathroom is a bit on the small side and it has a sliding door that in our room did not close well. You should prepare for very soft mattresses on the king beds. If this doesn’t bother you, you will be very comfortable. The daybeds have firm and hard mattresses, which I preferred. Also, prepare for some noise coming from the bar on Friday and Saturday nights, as there is a DJ until 12 AM whose music we could hear up to the 10th floor. However windows close well and sound insulation is good, noise coming from the avenue or otherwise should not bother you. The air conditioning equipment was probably a bit old, as it sometimes made some strange noises. We did not use the pool. It's rather small, about 15 meters long x 4 meters wide and it gets little sun because of the buildings. Housekeeping was fine, the room was neat and tidy, and they responded quickly whenever we asked for something. Finally, staff at reception were very friendly and helpful. I would especially like to thank Rachel and Joey, who were very attentive to my requests.

She was super professional also as I saw her deal with a ""challenging"" customer and Hoku was calm, collected, and extremely professional through out the encounter!Pros of the Laylow:Nicely decorated room, improved fitness room, great room amenities including gift basket with slippers, snacks, and bathroom stuff, 15th floor cappuccino machine and snack bar/breakfast bar was great (thanks Hoku!), 1pm complimentary shave, complimentary non-alcoholic drinks poolside, evening firepits, fruit and cookies around the hotel, and friendly staff. Pretty good poolside food (from the Hideout); ok foir Waikiki Prices. Cons of the Laylow:Being that it's a Marriot brand, A LOT of kids at the pool. And the pool is not that big. If you want peace and quite you will not get it at the pool. Go early if you want the loungers at the pool but of course in February the sun won't hit the pool till noon. Poolside service a bit slow so catch the servers when you can. ""Interesting"" layout to the room (funny corners, funny lighting, and obstructed view if you want to watch TV from the bed).

The little extras on the exec floors for frequent rewards members (Marriott Total Rewards) are a nice add-on for those on the move. The bar was a nice area to get morning coffee and eggs and log on for a little email and work. The resort charge is mandatory — not pleasant, as what it gets you gives diminishing returns: you only get the gift basket once and pool usage was rare. Valet parking is the way to go.

This hotel is not on the water, but it is in a great location and has a really good vibe. The staff have always been kind and attentive to my every need.

Sheila was so sweet and attentive after having endured a tongue lashing from a Guest who was never going to be satisfied. She was very helpful in getting me the room I wanted and making me feel welcome.Pros: Good location! Front Desk staff is efficient and friendly. Valet staff is fast! Fun pool scene! Excellent outside bar area! Very hip! Everything the W brand struggles to be!Cons: Coffee in the lobby is WAY too expensive! (Go next door for a cup of Kona blend at half the price.). No in-room coffee makers. Actually, a hotel branded in The Autograph Collection should have basic complimentary morning coffee service in the lobby. They measure the alcohol at the bar. (I just find that so NOT classy!). Location: Its on Kuhio Avenue, which has crime issues late at night. You just need to have good situational awareness when walking around this area of Waikiki. RESORT FEES! I hate resort fees! I find that such an insulting rip-off. This property should include the cost of value added amenities into the nightly rates. In the case of The Laylow, I am not quite sure what that extra $20.00 daily gets me, since this is a conventional city hotel by all standards and not a resort.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","alternateview</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",5,4.0

That aside, the inside of the hotel is beautifully done although quite quaint. I did like how this property is a bit tucked away off Kuhio ave but yet smack dab in the middle of Waikiki; kind of gives it it's ""lawlow"" feel. We got a Deluxe Corner Suite and were given the corner of the hotel facing Kuhio ave and the parking garage next to the pool. The room itself is BEAUTIFUL. They really have done a wonderful job with these rooms compared to what this hotel used to be. If this hotel was somewhere tucked away on the beach and a little bigger, it would be HEAVEN. This room had a very comfortable king bed, a queen daybed (essentially your couch), a little reading corner of sorts, and two balconies. The one thing that shocked me about this room was the bathroom. It was TINY and just standard shower, sink, and a toilet. Most properties would not have a ""Delux Corner Suite"" that's just got a standard hotel bathroom, let alone a tiny one. The Hideaway (the on-property restaurant and bar and cafe). This place is excellent. The food is amazing. Chicken Satay and Kalua pig egg rolls were some of our favorites. Even the service is great; very warm and welcoming but also on top of things. Bartenders are very friendly and knowledgeable in their craft. Drinks were great. My parters favorite drink is a ""pain killer"" and she mentioned they were pretty darn good. BONUS: it's on their happy hour menu. They also have nightly music. We were only there a few days mid-week so we go the live music vibe. On Thursdays-Saturdays they have live DJ's. The woman who was singing while we were there was AMAZING. Hey voice was powerful, on key, and the song choices were perfect for the lowkey vibe of the hideaway. Overall, this part of the hotel is on point. The pool is...well... small... This part is SO hard to review because you can tell they really tried. I mean it looks quite beautiful for what/where it is but it's tiny. The water went up to about waste high to me in the deep end and I'm about 5'9"". It also is right next door to a massive garage that's got some pretty loud fans coming from it that you can help but notice their humming sound in the background. There also surprisingly isn't much of a pool service. They do come around every once in a while but if you want a drink you just need to take a short walk over to the bar to order your drink. Some positives are the in-pool chairs that are always awesome to relax in. There are about 9 day beds and some chairs on the side of the pool, with two ""cabanas' at the end. Everything is first come first serve so if you want your pool time you've got to snag your spot. You can't reserve anything (believe me I tried). There is a massive building that towers over the pool so for a few hours during afternoon the pool is in complete shade followed by about another hour of sun, then it disappears behind the next building. So, again it's really hard to review because it's just the location in this case, not much to do with the grounds or staff or anything else. I did have a couple issues with house keeping. When we checked in to our suite, there was a dirty diaper just sitting on the floor. Kind of gross. We called down and they had someone come up. What surprised me was that we did not get the vibe that they were sorry there was a nasty dirty diaper left in our suite. Just came up, grabbed it, and left. Our second night we planned an amazing dinner at a local stake house. I highly recommend stopping at Mortons to anyone whose hungry for amazing steak. Anyway, when we got back from the pool to get ready for dinner the room wasn't cleaned ( we were gone from about (12:00pm-5pm and yes we did take the do not disturb sign off when we left). So, I called down and they said they would send somebody up. We left and went for a walk and came back about 45 minutes later as we were really pressed for time at this point. The house keeper literally just came in made the bed, and replaced towels. Didn't clean a single thing or take out any of the trash or room service items from the morning. Again, we were in the ""Delux corner suite"". I actually went downstairs to make their manage aware of this, she did apologize and offered to make it right by sending someone up but by that point I just was over it and wanted to spend time in the room. Over all this location has some great highs but it certainly has it's limitations. The staff are all great, the food is awesome and reasonable price, drinks are fantastic, pool is cool and hip but just in bad location, and the rooms are beautiful. Only thing that keeps it from being ""Very good"" is just the limitations of the property because of it's location and quaintness.","Redwood City, California","MR_SoWong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redwood City, California</strong>",11,4.0

The biggest disappointment was the pool area. - the pool is tiny and it is surrounded by big concrete buildings, one of them being a car parking house, in summary not much vacation atmosphere at all. Only a few sunbeds around the pool and even those are not movable to catch the few moments of sunshine when it happens to get into the pool area between the big concrete blocks... The car parking house next to the pool area creates a big noise, disturbing both during day time and especially in the night (couldn’t sleep with open windows because of that). On the positive - the rooms were fine and the service was fine, no complaints about that, just they cannot compensate the disadvantages of the property itself.You could possibly consider this hotel when travelling with children and for some reason want to avoid larger hotels on the beach. While the pool is tiny, it could still fit a couple of kids (and it mostly was occupied by kids) and the kids usually don’t care that much about the surroundings. Also, you could consider this hotel, if you don’t want to spend any time on pool or beach, otherwise it would clearly make sense to choose one of the beachfront hotels. However, considering a large number of positive reviews, there must be a market segment for this hotel as well, even if i don’t quite get it.","Tallinn, Estonia","Ago V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tallinn, Estonia</strong>",17,3.0

This stay was superb. Just to give an idea of the changes, last time Marriott's 4pm late checkout guarantee for elites wasn't recognized at all, even when taking up the issue with a manage. This time, I was proactively asked if I needed late checkout when I checked in. More generally, the hotel was very new last time, and the staff seemed far better trained this time. The room we received was excellent for our family of five, it's preferable to get a room on a higher floor if you can. The hotel breakfast is excellent, even if the $30 voucher for two for elites still won't quite cover it for most, I believe the menu at least makes that possible. The pool is small, but adequate for a family looking to splash around a bit, and the free shave ice at 1 and frozen grapes at 4 were much appreciated. The location is really excellent, right near many restaurants, shops, a Long's Drug Store, booths selling Hawaii tchachkas in the alley, food trucks, and even a McDonald's if the kids are sick of ""local"" food, but still close to the beach. There is a very popular and reasonably priced udon restaurant across the street, though we weren't fond of the food. The only two criticism I have is that the music downstairs, while ending reasonably early, might disturb guests who have just arrived from the mainland or Asia and are not yet on Hawaii time in their sleep schedule. Also, whomever designed the hotel should have provided for more than 2 elevators, they are always busy and when, like last year, one is out of service, it's a disaster. Hawaii rental cars are pricey, and the hotel charges $40 for parking, so we found it was cheaper and more efficient to get around by Uber and taxi (Uber was actually usually more expensive than taxis in most places, and unlike in most places minivan taxis that fit five are plentiful).","Potomac, Maryland","David B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Potomac, Maryland</strong>",94,5.0

I have a dog and as you dog owners know, dogs hate fireworks. So I think the expense of getting a hotel room at a pet friendly hotel in Waikiki for one night is worth it as I personally do not think it is a good idea to sedate my dog. I do realize because of the holiday the room rate was exorbitant, but it was a worthwhile expense for my dog. I have stayed in pet friendly hotels in the past and this hotel's pet policy is pretty easy. You don't have to notify them ahead of time that you will be bringing a pet. Pretty much any pet is welcome as long as the weight does not exceed 50 lbs and its one pet per room. There is a $150 pet fee per stay. So if you stay one day or 7 days its the same fee. I always book hotels on the hotels website, never through travel websites, this is to reduce the chances of them messing up the reservation. So in this case, there was no mysterious ""lost"" reservations. I made the reservation back in September and their cancellation policy was absolute, no refund at all for canceling, period, it didn't matter how far in advance you cancel. Understandable since it was a holiday weekend. I also compared prices with other pet friendly hotels and they were pretty much around the same price.Checking in was pretty simple, there was a line when we entered the lobby at about 3:15pm and more people lined up behind us. There were three people (max amount) working at the front desk and they were doing their best to keep up. The wait was about 15-20 minutes, check in was pretty usual and simple even with the dog. There was a lady passing out skewers of fresh pineapple to the people who were waiting. The woman who checked us in explained everything to us well and we were headed up to our room in another 15 minutes. I overheard some other guests complaining about how long the elevators take, but I did not feel that the wait for them was out of the ordinary. There were only two elevators and stairs that were easily accessible. The common areas were clean and neat even when it was a rush in the lobby. I did not make use of any of the hotels facilities or services other than the valet parking which is $39 per day.I no longer feel it necessary to stay awake until midnight to celebrate bringing in the new year. I pretty much planned to be in bed and asleep by 10pm. That worked out according to plan. That would have not been possible either if I stayed at home as people set off fireworks well into the wee hours of the morning. We went out to dinner, left the dog in the room, came back and she was there cuddled up in my bathrobe that I left on the bed. The hotel gives you a sign to hang on the door notifying anyone outside in the hallway that there is a pet in the room. I took a nice relaxing shower got into the bed and promptly fell asleep, we did not even hear the fireworks show that they do in Waikiki every new years eve. I woke up at about 6am. The room was clean, comfortable and spacious. I got the standard room with two king beds in it. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The room temperature did not have to be adjusted at all while we were there, it remained at a steady comfortable temperature during the day and night time. The room was on the third floor with a balcony that had two chairs on it and there was a pretty crappy view, but I wasn't there for the view. I am not sure if they designate specific floors or rooms to guests with pets, I did not ask. The bathroom only had a shower in it, no tub. I like that there was no tub. The shower was sizable and had sliding glass doors that covered the whole shower from wall to wall which was great because I hate those showers that have the half door on them. There was a small refrigerator, no coffee machine or kettle that I noticed. They had a basket with flip flops for use and some snacks and bottles of water. There was no indication that they charged you for it so I believe it was all complimentary. We drank the water, but did not use anything else. They gave us a card that allowed us $50 credit on activities in the hotel but we did not use it.The employees that I did interact with were professional and friendly and I did not have a problem with any of them. I believe if you have the pet sign hanging on the door housekeeping does not enter the room, you have to take the pet with you if you want the room cleaned. We only stayed one night so it really didn't matter.I would stay here again specifically to be able to bring a pet with me, though I feel it would be a good choice to stay without a pet and for a longer stay. The hotel is pretty centrally located in Waikiki and walking distance to many restaurants, bars and entertainment places. There are bus stops close by if you don't want to rent a car and taxis galore in Waikiki and of course Uber.",Hawaii,"Ha_Y_an_Traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawaii</strong>",66,5.0

This place is a Scam!!! Let's me start of by saying that I am a very frequent traveler. I have never been soo disappointed with a hotel in my life. 13 of us couples stayed at this hotel from dec 29- Jan 2nd at a 300% the regular rate due to the holidays. The min we got there we had issues, 1st they couldn't find our reservations, next they said the room ain't ready, keep on mind check in is at 3 and we got there 3:30... 10 out of the 13 couples had the same issue. We ended up eating at the hide out at the hotel which you can see my review for that as well... another 1 Star.... finally we got to room an hour or so later... they held on to our bags and when the bags arrived at the room my LV bag had random scratches on it that were not there before. The pool size was misleading from pictures all together. The next night we went out by the time we got back someone from room service came into the room and STOLE 2 rings that were made over 60 years ago... I had to file a police report but the hotel failed to even take this seriously. I even suggested for them to come to look through the room and our bags.... other couples which will post reviews soon will tell you about their room door being cracked open when they came back from New Year's Eve party which again makes no sense. The room service ladies walked into the room 4 times with out even knocking as rude as it gets. Room service stoped cleaning our room completely after I reported the stolen rings. No one from management even bother to reach out to me. This place is a motel 6 with a face lift at prices of major hotels that are beach front. What a joke... on top of it all they also stole a Gucci cologne but I didn't even care about that but that wasn't take seriously other. I am giving it a 1 Star and not a straight zero Bc the girl in the front desk Ashley has been really trying to help even though management clearly could of cared less. Note - there are thieves working here, room service will always get your order wrong, over priced and quality of food is trash. Management could care less you are spending 500$ a night.... no real costumer service. Next door to roof top which is load and will keep you up at night. You can see more about this at TripAdvisor in the next couple of days from all of my friends and you can see their reviews where somewhat similar. Don't do it, avoid the headache, any other hotel would of been better. I can't believe I lost a whole day of this vacation just between looking for the rings, filling up police / hotel reviews and dealing with all of this. Aka RUN AWAY AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, this place is a Scam! We didn’t have hot water for 2 days and the ceiling of the bathrooms were molded!!!",,Daniel K,4,1.0

Our room had a pull out bed, regular bed and sofa bed with a breakfast nook and two balconies. View was of the street but that was OK.

I even presented confirmation that stated a resort credit vs. food and beverage credit only to be told that hotel management would not honor our confirmation paperwork.

From the moment the vibrant staff greeted us we just knew we were in for a good week. The welcoming gift basket of Thongs and other goodies was a bonus.  The hotel and rooms decor are faultless. Kudos to the re-design team that got this refurbishment spot-on. An almost 60’s ish Deco design that befits Hawaii, our 12th Floor room was spacious and had a comfy bed too. The furniture, side tables and accessories were fab too. Our room had everything! The bathroom was well appointed and spacious  The Pool was surprisingly cool and cute too. Trendy and comfy like the rest of the Hotel, it served its purpose. It’s not the biggest but perfect for relaxing in for the midday sun periods. A bonus was the free Shaved Ice treats daily and the daily free poolside mocktails, a real treat. There is fresh fruit infused ice water throughout the hotel which is a plus. The poolside 24 hour modern Fitness Gym is small but most importantly clean and tidy. A bonus.  The Hideout Bar & Cafe in the entry Lobby was terrific too. The coffee was amongst the best in Waikiki. A daily must, even if not staying here. We started our day with breakfast at the Bar, usually entertained by the friendly Lindsey. Lunch and Dinner are also served here as well, along with Night Time entertainment.  I highly recommend this fine Hotel. It’s location on buzzing Kuhio is ideal (only 7 mins from lobby to beach sand) but it’s the vibrant staff and trendy fit-out that make it a must. I could not fault one Employee, but kudos to Lindsey and Richard for their time and attitude.  Not many downsides too.

There were lots of choices to eat away from the beach and it was only steps through the International Marketplace to the beach and the Holiday parade the day after Thanksgiving.

This is a great place to stay if you are using the hotel as home base and doing a lot of excursions away. This is NOT a resort hotel so I wouldn’t stay here if you plan to spend a lot of time at the pool or at the beach as the pool is quite small and the beach is a few blocks away (which is OK if you don’t mind the walk). There are other hotels that serve “resort” needs better. With that said, the Laylow is very centrally located. It’s one block to the main strip and easy access to get in and out of Waikiki by car (or Uber). For our annual trips to Oahu we usually stay a week in Waikiki and a week on the West Coast to get the best of both worlds so this hotel served our needs well. It’s also very new so everything is clean and up to date.We had a corner suite on the 14th floor. We were above the restaurant and street so there was a lot of noise until about 2-3AM. I slept with earplugs on but my family seemed OK with it. The layout for the suite was weird as there was a table area in one corner that was partitioned off from the rest of the room. Surely there must be a better way to use the space? The bathroom was quite small for the size of room and there was no bathtub, nor laundry line to dry swimwear and only one sink.Service was prompt for all of our needs and the room was well appointed. We had complimentary gift basket at check in that included Flip-Flops and some snacks and water to get us through the first night as we checked in quite late. There’s a small fridge that works well (many room fridges don’t keep things cold enough).The breakfasts at the restaurant was good too – detail review of the Hideout is separate. The pool was a bit cold and is a long rectangle meant originally for doing laps. They do have towel service and occasionally staff members would come by and offer free poolside treats like frozen fruit. Fitness equipment was good as well. Bell Desk and Valet were prompt and Concierge was able to answer all of our questions. If the price was right we would definitely stay here again!","Vancouver, Canada","Four_Star_Traveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",19,4.0

Nice bar, decent pool, live music at night - great location and cute rooms. No question here is the thing: there is a construction going on right now november 2018 (while i’m writing this) and will be going on for the next few months - drilling, hammering you name it. Its unbearable if you’re planing on working from your room. so its 7pm on friday and i can still hear them hammering. hotel staff doesn’t care and says its not their problem because its a restaurant in the building not associated with them. This is hard to believe as its literally under he escalator. my point is that they should at the minimum let their clients know that this is happening right now and there will be noise. . . But of course they don’t. for $300 a night save yourself a headache and find something near by. you can hear it in front back of the hotel 1 star due to unprofessionalism, not even “we apologize for the inconvenience” and tough sh$$ attitude from the front desk.

The landscaping includes lots of palms and two sandy fire pits with comfortable seating areas. The mid-century Hawaiian decor extends into the guest rooms, most of which have balconies. From my top floor balcony I had a glimpse of the ocean and the sunset. The menu at the Hideout restaurant includes fresh fish and other local items.

I did pre-check-in around 2:30pm and wandered around the area for the next 30 minutes until check-in. When I returned at 3pm, I learned that there was a further delay in my room by 30-45 minutes. Considering that I had to get ready for a 5pm meeting, I was not pleased. I was given a junior suite on a lower floor (not the executive floors as I wanted), but with access to the executive lounge. I was given a $50 credit for the restaurant, which I did not need or want since I would be eating out and leaving very early the next morning. The staff kindly gave me points in exchange for the credit since I told them that I wouldn't have any time to use it. 2) The hotel phone system was down. Every time I called guest services to have the valet bring my car around, the line would go dead. I had to use my cell phone to call the front desk. They said they were having problems with the phone system in the entire hotel, but this persisted for at least 12 hours.Summary: I have SPG Gold status, but it didn't seem to matter. I travel extensively, and I have never had a hotel bump me down in rooms because the hotel was oversold. I initially booked an ""Executive level, Executive Suite, King, Sofa bed, Waikiki view, Partial ocean view, High floor"" room. I ended up with a Junior Suite with no partial ocean view. I tried The Laylow as a new hotel option for this business trip in Honolulu, but I'm afraid that I haven't found a good business hotel yet. I fully accept that Honolulu is primarily and overwhelmingly a vacation destination, but there's still business to be done! I would reconsider staying at The Laylow only for vacation.","Los Angeles, California","SCSCSC11111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",22,3.0

It’s truly what Instagram dreams are made of. We stayed in an executive level suite, which had some daily freebies—continental breakfast (fruit, juice, coffee) and snacks during the day. Nothing major, but it was a nice additional touch. The room was clean, comfortable, and pretty spacious. Our room also had gorgeous ocean views. It was mesmerizing to watch the ocean from our room in the evenings. And the location was great too. The hotel is only a few blocks away from Waikiki beach and a short drive from other sights in the area (like Magic Island, for example). Staff were generally friendly and professional.There were a few small negatives during our stay. First, the hotel staff was not always immediately responsive. It took a while to get someone to come up and make up the daybed on our first night (3 of us slept in the room, requiring use of the daybed for sleeping). On another day no one answered the front desk number for a solid 15 minutes. And on our Saturday night stay, it took quite a long time for the valet to bring our car around (well past the time they told us it would take when we called down). We felt these were relatively minor inconveniences relative to the positives of the hotel.

To sum it up, if you are a traveler with no loyalty to a program or no elite status you will enjoy the property. It is a nice property with friendly staff in a super convenient location. Just beware as they do charge an exorbitant resort fee without providing any resort amenities. I know many complain about resort fees, but I don’t have a problem with them when they actually give you something worth the fee like beach chairs/umbrellas like many beach properties do. At this place nope. The resort fee gives you free shaved ice and a fruit basket to pick out of. Total scam. Honestly best to avoid this place.If you are a platinum member expecting any of your benefits to be honored, you should avoid this place as it is obvious the management does everything they can to skirt around the member benefits. As a platinum premier, I wasn’t even offered an upgraded room (which as a platinum is GUARANTEED IF AVAILABLE) at check in when there was virtually every suite type available for the length of my stay. Executive level, junior suite, family suite, and corner suites. When I mentioned this, their excuse was that they we’re not available for upgrade. If they don’t intend to honor the program then why even bother branding as a Marriott? The manager was hostile when and claimed the site has a glitch showing those rooms which was nonsense because later in the evening I overheard people checking in being offered a suite for a fee to upgrade. Totally shady business practices. What’s even worse is they sell executives level rooms when there’s is not even a lounge. They have a pantry basically offering room tempurate water and coffee and that’s about it. I spend a lot of money at Marriott/SPG properties with the promise of being granted certain benefits in return (when they are available). Being lied to, to avoid granting those benefits is not only frustrating, but leaves a black mark on the program. Total scam management running this property.","Brooklyn, New York","pork917</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",11,1.0

WOW!First thing my wife and I noticed about the hotel was the decoration...quite modern, seem like a lot of fun even at the smallest detail. For example, the room card for the executive level was different, has a reflective coating to make it look like its made of metal. The staff said the hotel likes to stand out and be different...they certainly made their point in my opinion. Checked into the room and we found a welcome basket full of snacks, postcard and two slippers. Fun!Room was very nice...not too big and not small either. About the right size. Service was perfect, even though we stayed only 1 night. Staff was friendly on check-in, was very helpful and answered with a smile whenever we had a question. There was a snack station on our level that not only was it constantly filled throughout the day, but it changes from time to time. I still think about the Macadamia Chocolate Chip cookies that was available...should have taken them all for the rest of our trip. ;o)Location was perfect...in Waikiki and the shoreline and shopping were all within a few minutes walking distance. The Laylow is practically next to the International Market. Already told the staff upon checkout that we certainly would stay there next time we visit Waikiki.","Shanghai, China","travelinggeo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Shanghai, China</strong>",38,5.0

As some others have noted, the hotel has a cool relaxing vibe when you enter. After a long flight we felt like were stepping in to great place to relax upon our arrival. Front staff were welcoming and helpful in getting us to our room. Our room was fantastic, we had a corner room with glimpses of Waikiki beach from our balconies. Room was spaciousness with a comfy bed and large bathroom.Prior to our arrival we worked with a concierge at the hotel, Meena. In a word, she was incredible! Prior to arrival, we talked to her about what we wanted to do, and she came up with a great plan. She was very knowledgeable about the Hawaian Islands and had many options for us to choose from. All of the activities were fun and allowed us to experience both Oahu and later Kauai, while leaving us time to enjoy the beach, sleep in, shop,etc. When we needed dinner recommendations on Oahu she had great recommendations and made reservations for us. Meena truly made us feel special during our visit to the hotel.We had lunch at the hotel on the day of our departure to Kauai and had a great burger and fries, and of course a cocktail or two. We spent the last day at the hotel lounging poolside waiting for our flight, The pool while not larger provides a great lounging experience. Definitely recommend the Laylow. Great location in Waikiki, with a short walk to the beach, shopping next door and tons of places to eat.

There were a choice of chairs (lounges, cabanas, chairs with tables), sunscreen and water. Free mocktails were served by the pool one day and staff can around with cool water to spray on us.- Hideout bar was great for food, coffee and drinks. The atmosphere was fantastic, I loved the lounges by the firepit.- The rooms had everything we needed. We had a view of diamond head to one side and the Royal Hawaiian to the other (and a car park straight ahead, but we didn't book a room with a view, so I was pretty happy). There were no towel rails in the bathroom but we made do with door handles. The lighting was also a little low in the room, but fine in the bathroom.- The location was about 2-3 minute walk to the beach, next to an ABC shop and Dukes Markets. Other shops (Macys, Nordstom, Rip Curl, International Marketplace, the Royal Hawaiian Centre etc) were about 1 minute away.- Extra perks included free shaved ice at 1pm daily, a welcome basket with thongs/flip flops/slippahs, water, snacks etc. And I'm pretty sure it's the most instagrammable hotel in waikiki ","Melbourne, Australia","788AmyM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",26,5.0

It was a bit of an experiment .... I wanted to see whether it would really diminish my experience by not staying at a fancy place right on the beach (and bonus, spend a lot less on the room).It was a great choice, what I loved about the Laylow was its proximity to shopping and restaurants and the trolley stop on Kuhio, breakfast at the Hideout was amazing (avocado toast with smoked salmon!!), the rooms were so fun with all the Hawaiian accessories and gift basket, great service at the pool, friendly housekeepers. I stayed on the Ho’okipa level which has the espresso machine, pastries/fruit/treats set out throughout the day, and a highlight for me was SPARKLING WATER ON TAP!!! This was so awesome, I need this in my house! The view from my room on the 15th floor looked out over the International Marketplace and over the top of the banyan tree you could see the Moana Surfrider and the ocean beyond.Bottom line, I loved the Laylow. The only thing I really missed from the RH was being able to sit under a pink umbrella at the beach ...but renting a beach set from Waikiki Beach Services was practically equivalent.I definitely recommend the Laylow.","Atherton, California","megustaelsolgirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atherton, California</strong>",35,5.0

The dissatisfaction that I had during my stay was the Destination Fee (29USD/night). I can understand the fee if they offered more, but it was lacking compared to if I stayed at a Marriott Resort.You’re offered one (1) food basket for the duration of your stay. That already doesn’t constitute the per night destination fee. If you get one every day, that would be great. It felt like an AirBnB; everything was manual. Asking for mugs in the morning, asking for hot water (eventually gave us a kettle), need to ask for utensils and no microwave. They had 4 cruisers available, so you’d be out of luck if you didn’t take one before the rush of people going out.Service by the staff was excellent from top to bottom.

We just finished a great staycation at the Laylow in Waikiki. Tucked just above the craziness of Kuhio and Kalakaua avenues, this boutique hotel indirectly anchors the recently renovated International Marketplace shopping center. When you arrive you'll have to go up an escalator or elevator to reach the main lobby, concierge, coffee bar, pool, bar and restaurant. They really did a great job with lobby decor so that the ambiance separates you from the noisy hustle of Kuhio Avenue below. Check in was a breeze and we were able to get a room on the 16th floor with partial ocean view, partial mountain view and full Waikiki views. When you exit the elevator on floor 16, you are greeted by a small coffee/water/snack station that was fully stocked throughout our stay, The pastries change between morning, afternoon and night. The coffee machine does tend to brew on the loud side, so I recommend a room just a bit away from that area.Our room was a delight. Super clean, airy with a nice contemporary tropical design. And with books on the shelves! They offer a welcome basket that included locally made chips, chocolates, water and two pairs of room slippers. And a toy rubber ducky! The A/C was nice and cold and from morning, noon and night we barely heard traffic from the down below. Nor could we hear the live music coming from the lobby bar at night. Dining options are slim but the restaurant/bar below called The Hideout served a really good breakfast. The shopping centers next door will open up your food options a bit. They do however offer room service.Overall, we would definitely stay at this property again. We really enjoyed our stay largely because of its size. It's not a gigantic mega resort.

It was a nice oasis away from the hussle and bussle of Wakiki. The rooftop bar had a good laid back atmosphere. We had breakfast at the hotel and found the service exceptional and the food to be very tasty. The food was not your normal American breakfast options; they had several local/Hawaiian dishes. The concierge booked our excursions for us. They were great to work with. They were very attentive and did a great job explaining our options as well as telling us about things on the other islands that they would recommend.The location is great and close to many excellent restaurant choices. We had stayed a few days on a different part of a Oahu and was finishing our trip to Oahu in Wakiki. We were able to drop off the rental car in town right next to the hotel and avoid paying the valet parking fees that the hotel charges. If you don't want a car the whole time, this is one thing to consider. There are quite a few car rental places near the hotel.My one disappointing factor of this hotel is that with gold status (now platinum premier) I didn't feel like this meant anything to this hotel nor do I recall if they recognized my status when I checked in. I was more recognized at the Marriott Kauai than I was here. I ended up on a room on a lower level right next to the elevator, which is completely fine.

It was previously the Aqua, and it went through a $60 million renovation and is managed by Marriott. The new theme is traditional Hawaiian, with a modern spin.The positives are the aloha, the amenities and the location. For example, we arrived a little over an hour before checkin. Our room was not ready, but Sheila at the front desk was kind enough to get us a room right away. There was a difference in price so she made it worth our while to change. We were happy to change because our daughters were really tired and needed a quiet place to take a nap. The amenities include a welcome basket that inlcudes slippers, a rubber ducky and a couple of bottles of water. Additionally, they offer ukele lessons, free shave ice, and free frozen fruit. Lastly, Laylow is located right next door to the hot shopping mall, The International Marketplace, and across the street from Marukame Udon, an inexpensive place to grab a meal.The only downsides are the location can get a lot of foot traffic because of the International Marketplace, and it seemed liked the elevators were slow. However, we noticed that the foot traffic died down during the week vs the weekend.All in all, a very pleasant experience vs the Vive and Hyatt Place up the street. Both of those places have their issues. I would have no problem staying at the Laylow again the next time I am in Waikiki.","Los Angeles, California","KeoPAloha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",101,4.0

They do a daily happy hour(s) and have some form of good quality live music. The painkiller cocktail was delicious.We stayed in a junior suite which was quite large for a hotel room. Lovely design, great bathroom with good amenities. Wifi was reliable and speedy. No problem streaming video.The only cons were that the room let a large amount of light in. We were on the 4th floor facing dukes lane and the car park lights were extremely bright so bring your eyepatches until they put in better blackout curtains.It was also a bit noisy at both night and morning but that can also be a pro because of its fantastic location and a bit of noise is to be expected.

The Laylow offers a great alternative to the more ubiquitous branded hotels in Waikiki - even though it's part of Marriott's Autograph Collection, you'll find no signs of Marriott branding and sales pitches here. The experience begins with valet or drop off on busy Kuhio Ave but a tall escalator ride up takes you to the relaxed atmosphere of an open air lanai, pool and reception lobby well above street level. Small in scale but high in style and character. Low-key but very helpful staff are available to meet your needs. Music permeates public areas and tempts you to take a deep breath. Pony up to the bar for crafted cocktails or custom coffees from the barista serving select procured roasts.Inside rooms are comfortable, contemporary furnishings and good use of valuable space. All upper floor rooms have balconies while pool cabanas get wicker swing pods. Mini fridges included but I couldn't get temp below 48. I also couldn't get the AC system to adjust as much as I wanted - but then I also didn't ask anyone for help. Plenty of spots to plug in devices but no in-room bluetooth speaker to use (glad I brought my own).I've only ever stayed in the Pool Cabana rooms - of which there are only 4 - and line up along the pool deck. If you need only a King bed and want easy in and out to pool and bar, these are must-have rooms for you!The Laylow may not be for everyone. Small kids will probably be bored but older children could appreciate the laid back attitude. Definitely great for couples or business traveler. There's typically a waitress serving the pool but you may be best doing more self-service which is an easy walk to the bar. You won't get nickel and dimed here - all pool lounges and cabanas are first come at no extra cost. Chilled Lemon water provided poolside. Pool is small but good enough for cool-down plunges. Biggest complaint here is the droning mechanical noise emanating from the adjoining International Marketplace Garage which abuts the pool deck. Poolside music helps. Rooms are well insulated though so with doors closed, you won't hear anything.Weekend nights have DJs and live music on the lanai. One restaurant serves breakfast/lunch/dinner. Being close to the Int'l Marketplace affords many benefits such as easy in-out shopping access, great food court alternatives, and tour shuttles/trolleys along Kuhio. I definitely recommend The Laylow for value, style, comfort and location as an alternative to larger resorts if that's how you roll.

Staff were not at all accommodating and my children fell asleep in the reception area after waiting for hours for our room. We were never offered a drink in the nearby cafe restaurant or for the children to jump in the pool. My husband approached the concierge on one occasion where the woman didn’t bother to make eye contact and was hopeless. When we returned a week later to stay the night before an early morning flight home the hotel had lost our pre-booked and pre-paid reservation. After blaming our travel agent and trying to blame us we were sent up to a room. We are a family of 5 and the room had one bed and a day bed. Our travel agent was in contact with us by then and confirmed that everything had been confirmed at her end of things. As we had already stayed the previous week in a room that accommodated us all it was obvious that The Laylow had lost our booking and given our room to someone else. The Laylow then tried to say they would charge us to upgrade to a larger room. We ended up 5 people in a room with two beds. Our travel agent offered to move us to another hotel which we would have gladly done however it was late and we had an early start. Shame on the front desk and management staff. That was our last night in Hawaii. My children were either stressed or so tired they said they would sleep on the floor. And we had already paid for the room. I would not recommend staying here. It’s completely overrated and the facilities are beyond basic with not even a kettle in the room. Fifteen floors of patterned wallpaper does not make for a boutique hotel or a boutique experience. The attitude of the front desk staff was disgusting. What a shame the Hideout cafe/restaurant is attached to this hotel. The staff and food there was amazing.

The hotel is mid-century modern Hawaii, it was a choice that provided a nice local flair to one of my favourite design styles. Our room was clean and comfortable with a balcony that overlooked the pool. We were on the third floor and did not find the pool to be noisy. The hotel has live music in the evenings and we enjoyed sitting on our balcony and listening to the music. We also had a pretty good view of fireworks from the beach one evening, at least the ones able to go above the buildings. I was particularly impressed with the friendly professionalism of the staff. Everyone with whom I interacted was attentive, friendly and was able to address my query or concern. Because we opted for breakfast during our stay, we had the opportunity to interact with the servers in the restaurant. They were very good and one was one of the best at the job that I have experienced anywhere. He managed to be available without hovering, engaging and entertaining without being intrusive and helped to make the mornings he was working a nice start to the day. The breakfasts were great. We were three and had five nights at the hotel so we divided and conquered the menu so that we could try everything. I loved the delicious savoury oatmeal and the buckwheat pancakes were light and the contrast with the macadamia nuts and kona coffee maple syrup accent was a delight. I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the loco moco but I enjoyed it. The meat was tender and flavourful, the only minor glitch was that the sunny side up eggs were slightly less cooked than I prefer but I was able to quickly remedy it by flipping them over into the hot gravy. Our daughter who is not a foodie and rather picky also enjoyed her breakfasts. We enjoyed the restaurant enough that we opted to have our last dinner in Honolulu there.

Love he décor, and the bed was very comfortable. We booked an Executive Room staying on the Ho'okipa level. Our view from the 11th floor looked out over the top of the car park to the International Markets (so not that appealing to some) but we could see glimpses of the ocean which was totally fine for us. We didn't really stay here for the views. There was a coffee station available to guests on this floor and basic snacks through the day - I wouldn't call this a continental breakfast as advertised. Nothing over the top amazing, and often there was no milk for the coffee etc, but it was a handy treat none-the-less. Loved the restaurant downstairs.

Laylow is very centrally located in Waikiki, just one block away from the famous Waikiki beach strip. It has been recently renovated just over a year ago.We got here early after an overnight flight. We were unable to check in straight the way because the night before was full and that's fair enough. The receptionist was great she took care of all our luggages while we cruise around the shops nearby. There are plenty of eateries and shops around the Laylow. The Udon shop opposite the road is constantly full with a huge line outside. Luckily we managed to try it on the first day.We checked in later in the afternoon. Our double room consists of two huge King beds. They were slightly soft but reasonably comfortable. The room also has several books regarding Hawaii, a ukelele, and an empty bar fridge which I prefer instead of having a whole heap of minibar stuff that we don't use. No kettle in the which is a little unusual. Bathroom has a nice shower with 4 different types of configs. The balcony is narrow and frankly not very usable especially on the 11th floor where we at.Laylow has a nice pool on the ground floor, it is narrow and right next to the main building which again worked out quite well it created nice shelter from the blazing sun. There are certain free items each day they serve as part of the resort amenties such as shaved ice etc. We never tried the restaurant as there are so many eateries around. The international food alley is closeby and also a Japanese food alley on the other side.The location is perfect if you would like to base your stay in Waikiki. The bus stops are close by they can get you to most tourist destinations.All the staff we encountered during our stay were friendly and very helpful. Have not encountered one issue from check in till check out.Overall we enjoyed our stay here very much.

We arrived early and were ready to drop off our luggage and hit the beach, but the friendly receptionist performed some magic so that we were able to go to our room right away. Our executive level room was wonderful—comfortable, beautiful decor, nice little balconies, fantastic bathroom with wonderful smelling bath products, and a nice welcome basket with snacks and flip-flops. The snack bar on the executive level was very nice and convenient—coffee, juice, and pastries. The only issues I had with the room: 1) No hooks in the bathroom. Nowhere to hang a towel or swimsuits. 2) The walls our a bit thin. We could hear the next room through the wall by the bed, but it wasn't much of a problem.The location was great—far enough away from the madness, but just a short walk from Waikiki Beach. Tons of food and shopping options nearby, although you'd do well to eat at the onsite restaurant, The Hideout. Great food and drinks, and just a lovely spot to relax. We didn't spend time at the pool, but it looked very inviting, if small. If you're limiting your stay to Honolulu you might want to forgo a rental car from the airport. Parking is VERY expensive and the valet stand tends to be backed up.We will definitely return to the Laylow. It is a fun, hip hotel, with a lot of character, and great service.

Unfortunately, it falls short in almost every other area.RoomThe room and build out of this hotel is absolutely gorgeous. Lots of little aesthetic details like a ukulele in the room and the interesting Hawaiian books on the book shelf. Unfortunately, the nice buildout was the best thing about the room. My husband and I stayed in, the ""cabana room"" right next to the pool, it was a little bit of a nightmare. The hanging chairs outside are absolutely darling, but other guests would use them, which made for awkward moments opening the slider in the morning. Our room, room 212, was a hallway and another room away from the gym, which doesn't seem like a big deal, but the floor is so poorly insulated that we could actually feel and hear people using the treadmill and worse than that were the guys slamming their weights down during their workouts starting around 5 am. It was so loud that I thought the noise was coming from above our room. My husband figured out what was going on and went over and asked one guy to stop slamming his weights as he was literally throwing them down after each set. We called the front desk a few other times to ask them to intervene, but with a 24 hour gym, we were up at 5 most mornings, very unpleasant. The AC unit was also very loud and had a difficult time keeping the room cool, so it would be on for 5 minutes, then off for 30 seconds and then back on. Lastly, there are literally no hooks in this room, not even in the bathroom. This made hanging up wet bathing suits and towels an issue.ServiceAll of the staff we encountered were very friendly. The downfall is that though everyone was friendly, there was a definite lack of efficiency and attention to detail. We ordered room service most mornings and there was not one time that the order was delivered correctly, an item was missing each time. I asked specifically if the chicken papaya salad had cilantro as an ingredient and was assured it did not, the salad was delivered with cilantro as one of the main ingredients. We ordered room service and asked for it to be delivered to the pool area, this request was also overlooked. An item of clothing went missing from our room. I asked three different employees to look into finding it and never heard back from one. Upon departure, I inquired once again and was told that they would contact me by phone. After a week of being home with no correspondence, I called and spoke with a manager who assured me that he would look into the matter and get back to me, I never heard back. I called back two weeks later and spoke with another front desk employee who assured me that she would look into it and call me back, nothing. Horrible customer service. The sheets were not changed once during our stay and the room was not vacuumed. We had to call to request more toilet paper and toiletries as they were not consistently restocked.Room ServiceThe food at the hotel is delicious! The food all tastes very fresh and it is obvious that quality ingredients are used. The tuna poke bowl was a favorite as were the mac nut sticky bun and fruit bowl. Though the food is all very tasty, every single item is delivered in disposable packaging delivered in a bag. For a beautiful boutique hotel on an island that is striving toward eco friendliness, this was a complete shock. My husband and I felt bad after each meal looking at all of the waste created. It is really unfortunate that the hotel can't come up with some sort of room service plan that doesn't involve creating so much waste. PoolThe pool area is darling with lots of greenery, complimentary fruit and shave ice. However, the pool itself is tiny, with little seating. There are only 32 spots for sitting or lounging around the pool, 22 spots are loungers, which makes for few spots when the sun is out. The pool is surrounded by high rise buildings, so the it gets sun from about 11-2. It is bordered by a parking garage on one side, and for some reason there were a lot of loud motorcycles revving their engines in the garage which was not relaxing. I will not be returning to the Laylow. Hopefully they will read this review and make some improvements.","Reno, Nevada","Megasis4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reno, Nevada</strong>",8,2.0

The service was fantastic and we had no issues whatsoever this time. We really like this hotel as it’s off the main strip but still within 5 minutes walking distance to Waikiki beach.

The service staff is also outstanding! Being a hotelier myself, I’m impressed on the follow up by this hotel. Usually you get a blah blah response...we’ve noted your concerns and do better next time... and nothing happens. These guys really tried hard to make our stay the second time outstanding and they did. We’ll be back. Thank you to Robert and his team. PS. They also fixed the platinum status issues.

However, we were placed on the third floor, and loud music blared every night from the hotel lobby. Forget trying to relax in the hotel room anytime before 11 pm when the music finally turns off, and that balcony? We were staring out over Duke's Lane into the parking lot, and being so close to street level was definitely a turnoff. We ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant several times, and the service at the hotel restaurant was overall lackadaisical. If you're looking for a self-serve, modern vibe, this is the place for you.

I would say this hotel met our families needs but we were far from blown away. The staff were all very friendly and had lots of smiles for their guests. Our room was large, comfortable and clean. The Hideout restaurant and bar has a nice atmosphere and very good food at prices that were on par with other similar establishments in the area. The hotel has a great location a couple block walk to the beach and tons of shopping and restaurant choices also within a couple blocks. This is an urban area though so peace and quiet is not happening. Live music, party goers and sirens punctuate the evening hours. The room sound proofing was very good so we could not hear our neighbors or hall noise but even on the 11th floor we could here music through the closed balcony door. Light sleepers will want white noise or earplugs or something. The views from the hotel are also urban, parking garages, shopping malls and other hotels are more prevalent than ocean and mountain view. I find it annoying that ""fancier"" hotels provide less for their guests than lower end hotels of the same brand. You won't find in room coffee or basic coffee available in the lobby without a hefty price tag. The top two executive floors have a coffee machine for guests of those floors. Since there is no real executive lounge gold/platinum members get a daily credit to the Hideout that will most likely leave you with out of pocket expense if you want to use it. There is no business center but the front desk will print boarding passes for you. We never got our internet service working correctly. We couldn't use the Hideout patio seating off the lobby to have our daughter eat a Subway sandwich because it is part of the bar so they wouldn't allow outside food. The $29 a day resort fee is absolutely ridiculous. This is a hotel and not a resort. I've been to many Marriott resorts and this hotel does not have even a small percentage of the amenities and activities available at an actual resort. The least pleasant part of our stay was the couple of days that the hallway on floor 11 smelled like a wet dog (or worse.) I don't know if something terrible happened to the carpet or they cleaned it as part of routine maintenance but I saw a staff member shampooing it and until it completely dried out it was gag worthy. Not what one expects from a nice hotel. We didn't even bother complaining as the couple of small things we had asked for like an extra blanket the first night were never taken care of. We stayed for 7 nights. We are loyal to the Marriott brand but I doubt we would choose this property again. We were expecting a 4+ star experience but it was just average.","Everett, Washington","KLS1118</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Everett, Washington</strong>",27,3.0

My friend and I make an annual trip to Oahu for Memorial Day and were looking forward to staying at the laylow. Unfortunately the hotel did not meet out expectations. I'll start with the positives:The renovation they underwent last year turned out really nice on the physical spaces, especially the bar area down stairs and the ""midcentury"" touches in the rooms. The shave ice (covered by destination fee) was goodThe hotel is next door to the international marketplace and a very easy walk to the beach.The Welcome basket was nice (also covered by destination fee)The toiletries were niceUnfortunately the night club across the street is super loud and they don't close until 4 in the morning. We got woken up a couple nights at their closing time, once because patrons were fighting with cops and once because the music is so loudThe views from the rooms are not great. If you are on a high enough floor you can see a pocket of ocean, but if you are below the 10th floor you will have a view of a parking lot. The reception area is very small so we had to wait a bit to have a couple of issues fixed.I'm not too fussy with the gold elite stuff but they offer extra points or a $30/room credit for breakfast which if you're traveling in a pair will likely leave you having to go out of pocket if you want to eat at the restaurant for breakfast. The destination fee also includes ""frozen poolside treats"" which was literally a single frozen grape for us. The pool area was not cleaned regularly either.

I very much appreciated: - Central location 3 doors from the International Market Place. - Humongous guest room. - Nice welcome basket. - Extremely clean (I pulled all the sheets/covers off and inspected down to the mattress) -- white, clean no dust, no bedbugs or other critters. Beach towels for borrowing at no fee. - Smart fridge. - Big flat screen. - The shower is large enough for 2. Water is hot, good pressure, the shower head is adjustable. - Quality toiletries products (I used with no side effects on my sensitive skin and face).- Very quiet (I didn't see many families, which I appreciated as a solo traveler).To be improved:- Air conditioning in my unit would not stay on auto, so I was up and down for both nights to adjust.- The carpets in the hall and elevator could use a good cleaning (not dirty or smelly but dingy for sure).- The lighting is not good at all. Too dark in the room even with all the lights. Also, the lamp on the bedside table needs to be replaced. It's so cool it's not functional.- The walls in the room also needed to be cleaned.- No in-room coffee or tea maker.- No bathtub. :(All rooms in all hotels were over $200/night during my time there.

That in itself will add $25 / day of ""transient tax"" to your bill, besides the resort tax of $29/day. The latter gives you access to wifi, the pool, and a basket of goodies, which is not worth $10. The basket comes with 2 bottles of water, which are NOT replenished everyday. I thought for a $29 a day resort fee that was unacceptable. Staff are friendly. Reception desk is really small so it can get backed up really easy. Room was on the small side, bed was comfortable though the mattress needs to be replaced. AC works well. Safe and small fridge in room. No slippers, robes or coffee/tea available in room. Bathroom was ok, toiletries were fine, nice towels and nice shower though the pressure was low. My room had a view to a parking structure and I could hear loud live music every night coming from the mall next door. Restaurant has happy hour everyday. Wine I was served had gone bad so they had to change it, which was not a problem. Food was nice. The mall next door has good local fast food and nice restaurants on the third floor.

As we arrived quite early in the morning our room was not ready until mid-afternoon but they stored our luggage for us. Our room was on the 12th floor with a tiny balcony from which we could see the ocean in the distance. We also looked over the car park next door which was fine as we were above the parked cars.The room was lovely and had some quirky additions that others have mentioned, ie the basket of goodies with chips, fruit chews, flip flops and a rubber duckie! The bed was comfortable but very low to the floor and the bathroom well equipped. The smart TV was huge and provided all services you might need. I found a wonderful Mark Twain book on Hawaii in the bookshelf and knew two days would not be enough time to read it and sightsee as well. I asked if I might buy the book and the shop downstairs willingly obliged. What a treat! He's written so many fabulous travel books. There were a number of other articles available for sale in the shop too.The bar and coffee shop near Reception was attractive, bright and airy but service was a bit slow. especially when we only ordered coffee. The pool looked inviting but we didn't swim. The location of the Laylow is great! Two blocks from Waikiki beach, an easy walk. The surrounding shops and restaurants are great with such a variety to choose from. Dukes Lane market is worth a look then continue across the road and down to the beach. The International Marketplace is also nearby. Buses to Ala Moana Mall are close by on Kuhio Avenue and are frequent. We were impressed with Laylow and knew we made the right decision to stay here.

The check-in process was quick and we were in our room on the 10th floor quickly. The lobby/pool/restaurant area of the hotel is located above the street level so the hotel is hidden from the sidewalk except for the valet (which can make it more difficult for Uber/Lyft drivers to find, but it wasn't ever an issue during the day). Our room was opposite of the pool and faced a parking structure. Both sides of the hotel face parking, but if you stay poolside and on a high floor you may have some partial ocean views. We did not care for the 10th Floor room as it was pretty noisy from Duke's Lane so after our first night we asked the front desk if there were any poolside rooms available, and they had a room on the Executive Level (floors 15 and 16) which include coffee, water and snacks. We told the front desk we were celebrating our honeymoon and they upgraded us to the executive level. Our new room was on the 16th floor facing the pool and had a great partial view of the ocean. The snacks and filtered water available were also great; each morning there was a new breakfast item available (cinnamon rolls, chocolate croissants, ect) with orange juice, snacks in the afternoon and cookies in the evening. The pool is very nice (although we didn't spend much time there with all the great beaches in Oahu!), but it was nice to get back and spend a few minutes relaxing in the warm salt water. The pool closes at 10pm and after 8pm it's more difficult to get towels (ask the front desk). The towels came in handy during the trip as we just checked out 2-4 each morning, took them to the beach and returned them each evening. The hotel staff was always very friendly and accommodating. When we switched rooms we forgot we had left a couple of items in a drawer and the staff went and grabbed them and kept them at the front desk until we returned from the beach. They also moved our packed bags to our new room for us, and has champagne and flower petals in our new room which was a great surprise! Each room gets a welcome basket upon check-in, which had sandals, chocolate, hi-chew candy chips and water. One final suggestion I'll make relates to the $50 credit you get to use for activities through the hotel's concierge - we sat with him and went through some options for the credit but they were all very expensive. In particular, we were planning to go to the Pearl Harbor memorial and the hotel option was an all-day deal with trips to all 4 pearl harbor sites and was much more expensive than what it costs to do the self-guided tours at each of the 4 locations. We ended up taking an Uber, going to the Arizona Memorial, USS Missouri and USS Bowfin for less than $100, and didn't take an entire day! Overall the hotel experience was excellent and we'd highly recommend it! It was great staying close to Waikiki while staying somewhat secluded.",Kansas,"KEVIN T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas</strong>",13,5.0

We booked a junior suite on Expedia for three nights. We decided to book a suite because we wanted a bigger, nicer room. We were given room 601, right next to the elevator, with a view of the parking garage next door. When we mentioned that to the front desk, they said all the junior suites are next to the elevator. Um....okay, that’s really lame and stupid. It would be helpful if they mention that on the website somewhere or give us the option of being in a non elevator suite. We heard a constant loud hum in the room, but couldn’t locate where it’s coming from. Could be the elevator, hard to tell. The hum is still there even when we are in the hallway, so it isn’t just our room. We called the front desk telling them the issue, they said they will send an engineer up and see what the issue is. I don’t know if the engineer actually came, because we left the room shortly after to go to the beach. When we came back a few hours later, the hum was still here. We went to the front desk and couldn’t locate the gentlemen that told us about sending an engineer earlier. So we talked to the lady at the front desk about the issue. No help from her. She treated us as if we are trying to stay here on points and didn’t deserve their attention and help. She gave us two options, we could downgrade to a normal room, but we wouldn’t get the difference in price back or any other form of credits. Or we could pay extra to upgrade to the corner suite. It was very frustrating because we were not trying to get a free upgrade here! We wanted a room that we could sleep in, without a loud and constant hum. And we wanted what we paid for. They basically want us to pay extra to solve a problem that is ENTIRELY, 100% on the hotel. The front desk staff were totally unhelpful. Are they new? I don’t know. Maybe they are trainees. But they didn’t act like they are in the hospitality business. Anyway, we ended up paying extra to upgrade to a non elevator suite in the corner on the 12th floor. The new suite is very nice and doesn’t face the garage and doesn’t have a constant loud hum. Also we had better treatment at the Hyatt we stayed earlier on points. Very disappointing so far and I have three nights to go. Hopefully no issues come up, I don’t want to deal with the front desks people again. ",,CarmenK747,6,1.0

First of all, wifi was terrible. I never was able to get speed of more than 1Mbps, which is not fast enough to do normal browsing. Ironically, I kept getting a message saying that I was at the “highest speed” for wifi as a result of my Gold status, so I can’t imagine the poor people suffering from even slower speed. For a cool hotel seeking people who want to relax, fast wifi is absolutely critical. Neighboring shopping malls had much better connections. I had a large, well-designed room, but there were a few big problems. The bed was way too soft. The shower pressure was weak and the shower head angle could not be adjusted. When I first checked in, the air conditioning was way too strong and couldn’t be adjusted, so maintenance had to come in and fix it. The front desk did not have a fax, so I had to go to a local UPS store, which is inexcusable. The restaurant design and layout were really suitable to relaxing, but the coffee was terrible and the breakfast menu could be much better. Finally, there was no laundry/dry cleaning service on Sunday. This is terrible for an upscale hotel.

Given that this is scheduled maintenance, the fact that they did not note this during check-in indicated a deliberate managerial decision to hide this from guests.The front desk was even more callous and unsympathetic. When I noted that I had an upset stomach, they did not offer bottled water, they did not offer alternate accommodations, nor did they even offer an apology. They simply said 'don't flush.'This is the most disrespectful thing that has ever been said to me by hotel staff. Because if someone has an upset stomach and cannot flush the toilet, you are basically asking them to vomit into a toilet full of their own diarrhea. They had a choice to try to make the situation right, and the option they selected was 'don't flush.'I would not recommend this hotel.

Had a great stay.1. Staff. Super friendly and welcoming. 2. Atmosphere. Not something we normally pay much attention to, or seek out. Yet clearly this place seeks to feel lively. The pool is ""cool"" enough for young adults, without being off-putting to families or older folks. So it's not a crazy party atmosphere, yet it's alive. The retro furnishing feed the feel of the place.3. Room. Our opinion is definitely influenced by the free upgrade based upon Marriott status. Wow. Huge corner suite room. We did not pay attention to how many it is permitted to sleep, yet 5 would be easy. King bed, queen futon, and a sofa. And a small dining table, and plenty of closet space. Very new, sleek bathroom with walk-in shower. Mini-fridge (although one of those hotel types where you can't adjust the temp/stays at about 42 degrees...fine for beer, maybe not cold enough for some foods). Super clean and fresh/in great repair.4. Welcome basket. Lots of reviews note this. It is a nice touch. 5. Location. Since we are there for business, we prefer Kuhio Ave or the side streets to the noise of Kaulakau Ave. Hotel is directly across the street from the super popular Udon place that has lines out the door most of the day. Easy walk to anywhere in Waikiki. Minor Con's:1. (Noise). IF one is a light sleeper, perhaps the live music from the restaurant/bar or pool could annoy you. Band is done by 10 Su-Th; and midnight Fri and Sat. I was one floor above the bar, with a lanai overlooking the bar area. I could hear the music, yet slept just fine. A friend had a room overlooking the pool, and noted the live music was fairly audible there too. Didn't bother us, yet can see how some might not like it. If that's the case, ask for a room on the opposite side from the pool (you'll be looking at a pedestrian alley, yet should be quiet....trade the cool pool view for less noise).2. Resort fee. So this is clearly advertised so its not a surprise. It's just a pet peeve of ours. Just charge what you need to for the room, period. Travelers get hit with so many add on fees (layers of lodging taxes, layers of rental car taxes), a resort fee feels like a gouge, whereas, it if was in the room rate, we'd never know. Management ties the fee to the welcome basket, and some freebies poolside during the day (which we don't use, and imagine few guests do....who travels to Hawaii to be sitting around the pool at noon...guests are touring the island, at the beach, etc). Neutral observations. 1. For Marriott gold/platinum, if the room upgrade is available, it's a huge perk. Didn't look up the rack rate difference in cost for the corner suite, yet it's clearly a much larger room. The hotel also offers a $15/day restaurant credit or 750/day in bongo points. We had a great stay and will hope they have vacancy for our next trip. Mahalo.","Yorktown, Virginia","FJVLS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorktown, Virginia</strong>",148,5.0

Staff were friendly, rooms were nice, it was a great location and had a great bar connected to the hotel with live entertainment. Some minor downsides;- upon our arrival, at about 7.30am local time, we were greeted by about 4 boys who helped us get our bags out of the taxi, they stated they’d bring our bags up if we were about to check in. It was still early, there were no other guests around. We checked in with no issues and were informed our bags would be brought up. We had to call reception about 4 times and at least an hour later our bags were finally brought up. We were very unsure what took so long as it was early in the morning and the boys were just standing around when we arrived- we paid for an “ocean view” room. Based on the location of this hotel I was skeptical as to how an ocean view was possible - I thought a partial ocean view perhaps would be a better title. Our room had a very very very minimal view of the sea. If we weren’t so tired and jet lagged I would have contacted reception stating it wasn’t an ocean view room at all, rather a view of a carpark with a tiny bit of ocean. But after waiting 1+ hour for our bags I wasn’t in the mood- housekeeping was poor. They attended to our room each day, however they did not change our sheets. 4 days in we requested with reception that our sheets be changed. Reception was surprised this hadn’t been done, and wrote a note requesting it be done the next day. The next day passed and still no sheet change. Once again we spoke with reception. The next day and still no sheet change, this is 6 days in to our 10 day stay. We don’t expect fresh sheets daily but in a 4 star hotel we’d expect a couple of sheet changes. The next day two of us were in the room when house keeping came around and we had to ask them to change the sheets, they obviously weren’t impressed with this- the pool was a little small for the size of the hotel, and it was very shallow. Coming up to about my waist at best. Nonetheless it was pleasant, had some comfortable seating and each day there was a complimentary pool drink as well as shaved ice Overall a pleasant hotel, very funky however some room for improvement!

The description on Marriott.com listed ""pool cabana"" as part of the room. When we arrived, we found out that the cabana wasn't a reserved cabana but rather a hanging chair on the balcony that wasn't private. While they were supposed to be for our use, people could easily walk over to them and use them, and did. The hotel can argue the definition of cabana, but I think most people would expect an actual cabana over a hanging chair the way it's advertised. The real lay down cabanas at the pool, which there were only two, were first come first served and were not included in the room as described. I consider the advertising to be misleading, so understand it's a hanging chair that they're calling a cabana, and it's not private, outside of the hotel potentially putting a ""reserved' sign on them which people ignored. We had some other problems with the locks on the sliding doors and ended up changing rooms. The locks were not working properly, and we ended up having engineering coming into the room. After they worked on it for about 30 minutes, we decided to change rooms. My partner cut his finger on the door, so we were just ready to move. The hotel moved us to a 2 bedroom king room on the 11th floor but offered no refund or compensation for my partner's bleeding knuckle. While the manager on duty did initially say they would do something, he spoke to the general manager and came back and changed the story. They gave us bandaids and offered only to file an accident report. While I understand insurance is the issue, they should have simply made a gesture of a rate decrease or a drink, just something to smooth out the experience. We found the resolution to be inadequate and cold. I'm a Platinum Elite member with Marriott, so I expected them to handle it better. Other comments about Platinum Elite benefits are spot on. Don't expect to be upgraded and expect a $15.00 food and beverage credit per day per person that can be applied over Club benefits or free breakfast. While the hotel has been remodeled and is a good location, I found it to be just average and the experience we had overall means I wouldn't recommend or return to this hotel.

Hokulani was extremely helpful on the phone to help us know how to get the best rate; she also honestly answered questions about the suitability of this hotel for my family which I really appreciated. For example, I asked if the hotel was loud because I have small children; she said there was live music there for the weekend and that she would place us in a room higher up to minimize the noise. She followed through with a great room on the 9th floor and the opposite side from where the music was. The hotel has a nice feel, modern but classic Hawaii at the same time, with nice little perks (small gift basket in the room, shave ice for the kids, apple cider by the pool) and comfortable furnishings. It was great for our family. It's also nicely located in Waikiki near food options, walking distance to the beach, easy to find. My one criticism (which is not unique to this property) is the now prevalent practice of charging a 'resort fee' for a hotel. It's sort of like the bag fee when flying...it used to be part of the service of flying to check a bag for free; likewise, the resort fee I think goes for things that used to be standard (like expecting to be able to use a towel at the pool) - actually, I'm not even sure what it's for. But all in all, so happy with our choice of the Laylow and feeling so grateful we picked this property after our very stressful incident at our home.

It was a risk to stay here because I've stayed at several Marriott properties but never an 'autograph collection' one. Because of this property, I now fully trust the entire Autograph Collection line! From the very start, the open-air lobby blew our minds away. So stunning! The gift basket was a very nice surprise as well, and they even let us trade out our flip flops for better sizes! The location of the hotel was by far one of the best parts. We could walk anywhere for food or souvenirs or breakfast or to Waikiki beach!! And our teenagers could walk around safely while still staying very close to the hotel.The hotel staff, especially Patricia and Genesis, were extremely accommodating. She really prepared me for what to expect although I was still blown away.I did not pick this location for the pool, but my girls actually loved it. It's small but I think that's actually one of the reasons they loved it??And I was also surprised by the valet service! Not only did they ask us to schedule when our car is needed every day so we didn't have to call down, but they loaned us boogie boards and bikes! It was the PERFECT idea to stay downtown Waikiki and then travel out each day for excursions. The beds..... oh my goodness the beds.....LOVED the design of the rooms.We hung out at the 'Hideout' every evening! Open air hangout area where you can also grab drinks and food.

Upon check-in, they did acknowledge my platinum elite status and birthday celebration. However, there is no offer of any complimentary upgrades. There is no lounge access but instead provided $15 vouchers per person per night. They said that the executive level “lounge” is only available to guests staying at those level and not for any platinum members. My marriott profile has high floor listed as a preference. They gave me a room on the 9th floor (out of 16) and told me that it is a high floor. The $15 per person voucher barely covers the cost of an entree as half of the breakfast entrees are over $15. There is also this confusing line item added as a service charge which was explained to me as something internal between the hotel and servers whenever vouchers are used and is normally taken off the total cost of bill. But do double check to make sure it is not included as part of the total due. My recent stay at an autograph collection hotel in Miami (Turnberry Isle), free breakfast is actually “free” - includes beverages and tax gratuity is included. In this case, these vouchers are merely discounts. The one good thing is that you can use these vouchers for breakfast, lunch, or dinner but no alcoholic beverages. You just have to use it on the specific date listed on the voucher. The platinum arrival gift of $10 can be used during the stay and on alcohol. Don’t expect any freebies from hotel for birthday. No acknowledgement or anything. But that’s okay... I didn’t even bother to say anything. Valet parking per day is $35 plus tax. What they called “destination fee” is another $25 per day. Essentially what you are paying is the E Komo Mai basket, pool towels, and daily shaved ice. There are other daily poolside delights listed as perks, but they are often unavailable. I waited for the drink sample one day but was told they are not ready... I approached the front desk about it and they said they will bring it up to the food and beverage manager. The day before, the frozen fruit bites was a no show either. Don’t list amenities as part of the reason for this daily destination fee but then fail to deliver. Now despite these short comings, I do love the location of this hotel and proximity to great restaurants and shopping. The starbucks reserve and kona coffee purveyor is just a block away and the beach is a quick 5 mins walk. The valet attendants as well as the staff and servers are all really nice and attentive. The housekeeping service is efficient. The management just need to up the level if they want to entice ritz carlton/marriott/spg members to pick this hotel when visiting oahu.

Executive summary: great place!Pros:Comfortable beds, spacious room, fluffy towels, very clean, bathrobes, friendly service, excellent location if you are looking for something not on beach front. Great insulation for noise reduction. In room systems are top notch. Extra touches that made it special: e komo mai gift basket, ukelele in room (mine was hopelessly out of tune, so I could not play it), shave ice every afternoonGreat coffee shop -would have liked more options than just pastries, I like some protein in morning- but they serve stumptown coffee, which is my favorite. They also start at 5 a.m., which is great when you are still on mainland time.The Hideout is a lovely bar and restaurant that goes from morning to night. Evenings are lively with entertainment and ukelele lessons and great cocktails.The pool is small but great, and the hanging chairs are cute and fun.More about location: everything you could possibly want is right outside, including groceries, an ABC, a mall with shopping, dining and a nightly mini luau. Buses go right by, and there is a food truck court and laundromat 1 block away. Waikiki beach is 1.5 blocks away. The hotel provides beach towels, so just grab one and go! Super fun and easy.Cons:Only a few tiny things that did not ruin anything, but that were slightly annoying: there are no hooks in the bathroom, and the elevators can be a bottleneck during busy times.

Would have liked a coffee pot however got coupons to use in coffee, restaurant, bar area that could be used any time of the day for marriott status. Coffee was good at bistro, I like latte's and the fact it was pouring one morning was wonderful to just eat in. Breakfast was truly delicious we probably tried every morning entree with 5 of us in a 4 night period. Twice we ate dinner there while our adult children went someone else. Was really good especially the short rib and burger. Service each time was great for us.Happy hour is really great and discounted food and drinks we had them twice, great place to meet up with our friends. The spring rolls are especially good and the flat bread.There are so many shops and restaurants in the area and a short stroll to the beach, valet was on spot each time. The price of the rooms were really reasonable for a large city. They truly did a great remodel of the building, has a great modern vibe.The pool area is nice with comfy large lounges and we sat talking with friends most nights there.

Having been a loyal Marriott Rewards member for many years and with good status, we were lucky to receive an upgrade to a corner room on both stays of this particular trip. This room was slightly larger, and definitely one of the more ""homely"" hotel rooms I have ever experienced.The hotel had held three Amazon packages that had been delivered in the days before our arrival, and these were promptly put into our room after our check-in.The pool and the coffee shop are located on the first floor beside the reception, and they have a very pleasant feel to them. The busy main streets (Kuhio and Kalakaua) are literally down the escalator, but up here you feel removed from the hustle and the bustle. The staff are friendly and positive, and they are happy to assist with any request you may have.The GM and his management team have made a habit of being present in the lobby at various times during the day, and it is very easy to strike up a conversation, address concerns, or to give praise. On that latter note, I wanted to give a positive mention to Marianne in the coffee shop and to Stephanie at the front desk, they both went above and beyond in terms of personable service and making us feel welcome.In short, this hotel was an excellent find. It seems that the building had been a less desirable property prior to the renovation and subsequent opening as the Laylow Hotel. It is very clear that everyone at this property is now working hard to win the hearts and minds of those travelers who may be associating something more average with this address.

Upon arrival I was instantly impressed. The location is perfect. It's very modern, chic & put me in the mind of a ""boutique"" hotel. Gabby & Victoria are absolutely awesome!!! Also Milan, he works at the Hideout, is the bomb!  Now, there were some things that I had an issue with. The main one being the $25/day amenity fee. I knew upfront that I'd be paying this amenity fee, so it wasn't a shock once I checked in. However, I assumed it would have included a few bottled waters EVERY day...boy was I wrong! There was a cute little basket filled with goodies, flip flops & 2 bottled waters. That is all of the water you'll be getting from the property throughout your stay. I spent over $100 on the amenity fee and I feel like bottled water on a daily basis should have been included! Also, while the room does include a mini fridge it does not come with a microwave. I was okay with that too, once again I assumed that there was one available for guests to use in a ""common/vending"" area. Well I was wrong on that too. We spent a countless amount of money on food, brought back leftovers only to be told there was no where we could heat our food up. Laylow, please use some of the $25 amenity fee money to purchase a microwave for guests to use. The room also does not include a coffee maker, this wasn't a big deal because I don't drink coffee. However, I would've liked having something available to make hot tea in the evenings. The only resolution was to get hot water from the restaurant on site....what an inconvenience!Housekeeping ~ they definitely need to work on this! When I leave my room around 9am on a daily basis & don't return until well after 3pm, I expect to come back to my room being cleaned. I was there 5 nights/6 days...4 of those days I had to request housekeeping service. I just don't understand what they were doing, every time I saw the housekeeping crew they were in the hallways in clusters of 4-5 people. They need to do less socializing & more cleaning. That is ridiculous to charge what this property charges but not have their housekeeping up to par!All in all, I would give the Laylow another chance. I really hope that they pay attention to these reviews & consider making some changes that will result in this being the PERFECT property to stay at.

I cross reference everything here. I almost didn’t stay at the Laylow because the guest pictures always look so dark and uninviting (I later came to figure out why), but after an Air BnB nightmare, it was close to where we were supposed to stay and they had a room available at the 13th hour. When we pulled up to the property it’s instantly appealing. From the friendly valet guys to the awesome tiki torches and music coming from the rooftop. Up the stairs to the super quaint lobby, with the ocean breeze coming in, the amazing pool and indoor swings. I was already in love. The front desk staff was so amazing. They always had good attitudes and helpful. Our room was on the 14th floor. We had a nice balcony with a slight view of the ocean and nice view of Diamond Head. The room was very well decorated and the lights were very warm and romantic (hints the pictures). There was also an amazing welcome basket full of goodies. Hideout: the food was to die for. We ate there at least once a day. You have to try the North Shore Crab cakes...help Jesus. Lol. And the rooftop patio makes you want to sip drinks and never leave. I wish I would have been able to take advantage of all the other hotel amenities like the ukulele lessons, the bikes, and pool. But too much exploring the island. I did however love that you could check out beach towels and the $50 excursion voucher. Overall, super staff, beautiful property, yummy food.

As a frequent visitor to Hawaii, I was excited to hear about this new hotel. As we were traveling with a baby, the room size was priority instead of it being ocean front. The hotel website is beautiful, and the price was right. I thought we got the right hotel for us.Our stay at Laylow, unfortunately, started ""low"". A month before our arrival, Laylow's customer service representative and I corresponded so that we can have a corner room on Executive Floor facing the ocean. We also requested a crib and a kettle. On our arrival day, our flight got delayed and we were checking in much later than we planned. I called Laylow right away and explained the situation. It sounded as if everything was taken care of - however, regardless of my efforts, our stay did not start smoothly. We arrived at a hotel and was welcomed by a somewhat happy lady for the check in. My Marriott Gold status was not even acknowledged (and no voucher for Gold members was offered.) Being too tired to argue, we went to our room. Our room was not what we promised via email -- the room was completely on a opposite side of the room we requested. No crib. No kettle. No welcome basket. Dirty sink. No confirmation of baby sitter (I was calling Concierge more than 4 days to confirm this.) I called the front desk but she was unwilling to do anything to solve the situation. Feeling desperate, I reached out to Marriott International and luckily they contacted me right away to get me connected to the Assistant Manager. The assistant manager (I forgot her name) was very helpful and tried her best to accommodate what was promised. She assigned us to the right room, sent us some champagne with freshly baked pineapple cake with a hand written card, and made sure that we got food vouchers. From this point on, our stay became more enjoyable. Despite all the disappointment we experienced on Day 1, there are some positive sides which I need to mention. First, yes, the executive floor lounge is underwhelming but their pastry is pretty delicious. Please have cinnamon roll, chocolate croissant, and sticky bun, more often, though. They were much better than the ham and cheese croissants. Second, the room is quite spacious for a hotel in Waikiki. With adjacent windows of the corner opening to two sides, we never felt cramped during the stay. Third, there are some really good staff, including front desk staff (if not all) and assistant manager, working at this property. Please do keep them! Fourth, the pool-side cabana was very nice for a family with a little one. As a newish hotel, the hotel needs to work on some issues, however. First, some front desk staff needs better training or find some other line of work. I was frankly surprised when she, I withhold the name here, was not willing to help us out all when I contacted upon arrival. Second, although people at concierge are nice, and I understood that they are busy, it would have been nicer if they could have confirmed reservation promptly. Third, the food at Hideout is good - but it lost its flavor when the room dining was served in a plastic container with plastic utensils. I would suggest using porcelain plates and metal utensils, instead. Fourth, the bathroom on the lobby floor (the one accessible from the swimming pool), was not clean often times. I recommend sending the cleaning crew more often.","East Lansing, MI","lovebossa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>East Lansing, MI</strong>",26,3.0

Most tourist-hotels jockey for position to be as close to the beach as possible, and the ones that retreat one block inland to Kuhio Ave are generic or business-oriented. The Laylow, along with the nearby Hyatt Centric, are the exceptions to this. The Laylow offers everything a leisure traveler should expect from a mid-range hotel. Good service, a clean/comfortable room, good pool, good bar/restaurant. That being said, it is not a resort: no spa, no luau, etc. (which the nearby resorts will gladly offer to non-guests). Despite being in an urban environment, our room on the 10th floor had zero street noise at night, but you could hear the sounds of the city during the day while on the balcony (duh).The same situation can be described for Hyatt Centric, and it really comes down to personal preference. If you want something sleek/sexy, Hyatt Centric may be better for you. If you want a fun (almost campy) ""I'm in Hawaii"" feel, go to The Laylow. As a tie-breaker, the Laylow is closer to the International Marketplace, which not only offers great food/shopping options, it also provides as comfortable and convenient route to the beach.As a Marriott Gold, I was treated well; they provided dining vouchers and a generous room upgrade. The only complaint I have about the hotel was the elevators. There are only two on the property (no service elevator) and they routinely required a 3-5 minute wait during the day. I considered this to be a nuisance instead of a showstopper though.If you don't want to pay beachfront prices and don't mind a bit of extra walking, but still want a fun/comfortable place to stay, you can't go wrong with The Laylow.","West Chester, Pennsylvania","PatMcpsu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Chester, Pennsylvania</strong>",67,5.0

Free flip flops provided in your room to walk across the street to the beach. Excellent coffee and Kona Coffee Purveyors right next door. My personal favorite was the sofa style loungers at the pool, perfect for a nap or a tan, while you wait for complimentary pineapple-coconut water served right to you.

Upon check-in, I had to ask for a complimentary room upgrade with my gold status, but she kept insisting that she wasn't able to verify my status which never happened to me. I had to browse to pull my account information online, and she complained how the system was odd. The next two days were nightmare. Like other reviewers mentioned, the pool music was very LOUD. They started to play before 8AM, and we were awake due to the disturbing loud music. Second day, he heard the drill sound and thought there was construction going on upstairs and we couldn't resist anymore after few hours of consistent drilling, so I asked the front if we could change the room, but I was told that there wasn't any available (When I checked online at Marriott website, I was able to see the vacant rooms though). The front desk receptionists were very uninformative and kept repeating that the noise was from the escalator repair (YES! the escalator also had a problem and didn't work) even though the room we were assigned at opposite end, and the noise was coming from the up-stair. I even video taped it. They only have two elevators, and one wasn't working the whole time we were there along with the escalator, so it took 10-15 minutes to just catch the elevator. Third day we were there, there was a fire alarm and announcement that it wasn't drill but real. I was in shower and panicked. We just got out and I just had wrapped myself with the bath towel, and guess what? it was an error!This place is a joke. I travel alot, and I've never experienced something like thisMy expectation for any Autograph Collection hotels are ZERO.

There was a very nice welcome basket in the room of island snacks and event zories (flip-flops). The only issues that were encountered was loud music coming up from the nearby International Market but it usually quit by 10:00PM and while there, one of the elevators was not working. This caused long lines for accessing the remaining elevator either going up or down. Other than that, the rooms were nicely furnished.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised. Right in the heart of Waikiki Beach, 2 streets off the beach, it was perfect. After a long day of business I was able to escape to the open air lobby for drinks at the bar, or travel within a two block radius and eat some of the best food I have ever had. I was told by a local that the Laylow has recently re-modeled their rooms. They did a great job. Beds are super comfortable and the shower is spacious. In fact, I liked the shower head so much that I found out the brand and model and purchased one off Amazon when I got home. I used the fitness room several times and it had all the necessary basics. I did not use the pool, but there were always a lot of people out there lounging around. The only downside is that my room had a view of the parking lot, but that didn't bother me as I was only in it to sleep and get ready for my day. I would get up early at 4:30am (due to the time difference from Virginia), and hit the Starbucks next door (which opened at 4:30am thank goodness). Then I would come back to the hotel and sit in the bar/restaurant area and drink my coffee. Very pleasant experience. I included 2 pictures of the view from where I was drinking my coffee. The large building is a condo across the street and the street shot is of the udon noodle restaurant right across the street. Everyone who worked at the Laylow was extremely pleasant and helpful. I had some business associates who stayed in a different hotel and were not pleased with their situation. Especially after they saw my room...and shower!",,Tommy D,2,5.0

Located right next to the new international market place, it’s convenient for restaurants and is central to most things in Waikiki. -it’s unheard of to find a room that can accommodate 2 King beds. This is really nice when traveling with kids or friends. -bed was really comfortable. They provided a firm pillow and a soft pillow for each person. -air condition worked well. -WiFi was free. Tv was a smart tv so you can hook into your Netflix when needed. -Downstairs has a coffee bar (serves stumptown coffee) and has a restaurant where the food was good. -parking for $35 a Day is average for Waikiki but that being said, the valet guys are great. Very helpful, very patient, very friendly. They were by far the friendliest staff at the hotel.Could be improved but not deal breakers:-tv, phone and mini fridge functioned intermittently. Had to power off/on several times for it to work. -no view. The building only faces car garages. -this hotel is not ideal for kids. The pool is small and meant for relaxing, the bar downstairs had live music but was really loud. -little dresser and counter space. Again might not matter to most but with kids it makes things difficult. -wish they had a coffee machine and a microwave. -the toiletries provided were not very good. Had to buy the necessities at an abc store. -wish they offered beach towels. -the room service menu was limited to several items whereas if you were to get take out from the restaurant below, the selection is greater. Which is kind of a pain to have to go downstairs. -with the exception of the valet, the rest of the staff were just ok. Not unfriendly but not the type of local friendliness I’m used to.

Room:The room had an older layout feel, but everything inside is refurbished. So it's like a mixture of old and new, although it's ""new"". Bed was comfy, decor was typical Hawaiian and happy, and bathroom was adequate space wise. No double sinks or fancy showerheads or toilets. We got a room on the fifth floor. It is on the side of the bar and was super noisy at night. If you are trying to sleep early, then this might not be the room for you, as the music doesn't stop until the early morning. However, if you were like us, then you joined the festivities and the loud music was not a problem. Breakfast:For Marriott gold, don't expect a full on breakfast experience like a typical Marriott. We got coffee from a Nespresso type machine, some Hawaiian donuts or pastries, and a fruit. There is no lounge. I'm not sure about the restaurant, as we did not dined there. There are many places to eat within' walking distance.Pool:It's a smaller pool, and depending on time of day, will not get sunlight as it's blocked from all the high rises around. It's a nice pool. A bit crowded though.Bar:LOVE IT. If I were to go back to this hotel, it's to hang out at the bar and get a drink. Urban feel and trendy. It felt like a rooftop bar, but it wasn't ""rooftop"". I think a lot of the renovations went into the bar. Location:Being across the street from Marukame Udon was a high plus. It's not on the beach, but still central. It's within' walking distance to all the Waikiki Beach places, shopping, food, two blocks from the beach. I like it's location. Overall:We would stay here again to experience Waikiki Beach and Honolulu. If we want a beach getaway, we would stay closer to the beach. But if that's what we wanted, we'd go to Maui or Kauai to ""relax"". Honolulu is to walk around, eat, enjoy night life, and have fun! The Laylow is adequate for all that.",,Guppies-cn,51,4.0

The elevators take long, as there are many young families with one kid, but all the gear (massive stroller plus a beach wagon!) The restaurant serves delicious food. We only ate breakfast there and found the prices to be in reasonable (as the take out places next door charge the same for similar items.) The staff was great. The front desk is only manned by at most 2 people, so sometimes they take long, but they were always happy to help. The valet, if you call ahead, they have your car waiting.

The lobby is a smaller open air design that flows right into the bar and restaurant as well as pool. Its a few blocks off the beach which is walkable or you can take a free bike, which I highly recommend. At night, the bar makes great drinks, several craft beers on draft and their food menu is simple but outstanding. Try the spicy edamame. I've run into so many international travelers that stop down for a drink and listen to the live music. I guess they recruit locals that can sing well which also attracts people to the bar.

They pass out drink samples and have shaved ice every day at no charge. Breakfast in the restaurant was delicious and so was dinner. We ate there every day. No need to go anywhere else. Servers were quick and friendly. They also have live music every night by some local musicians. Sit at one of the firepits, have a cocktail and life is good! The ambiance was perfect.Best thing is their coffee shop that opens every morning at 4am where you can get a delicious latte from a friendly barista. Perfect for us jet lagged east coasters.The rooms are large enough, we liked our two king beds, and the bathroom, while not huge is perfect with cool wood tiles in the shower. Housekeeping was spot on and the girl who cleaned our room was very nice. There is a neat welcome basket in the room with Hawaiian sandals and some delicious local snacks. Loved it. They also have a ukulele in the room that you can bring down to a free ukulele lesson at their restaurant lanai. Have a cocktail and you'll learn real quick! You can also buy them at their gift shop which has some other nice little gifts and souvenirs. We liked some of the local soaps and sunscreens and took some home with us.But what was most impressive, was the staff. Literally everyone that we encountered was super friendly, always eager to help and greeted us with a friendly smile and aloha whenever they saw us. We celebrated my wife's birthday and when they found out they sent us some wine and chocolates.The Concierge hooked us up with a couple of cool activities which we really liked. They are very knowledgeable and easy to work with. During peak times there was a line but the front desk jumped in and helped us out with some directions.I usually don't write long surveys but I just wanted to thank them for making our trip very special. Wish I remembered some of the names of the great staff. I would stay there again in a heart beat.","Coral Gables, Florida","bigcitymia1980</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coral Gables, Florida</strong>",11,5.0

Subsequent attempts in following up with the staff about the lost item were equally met with rudeness and even eye-rolls. Additionally, the hot water in the shower stopped working one night, and when we requested for maintenance, the staff simply told us that nothing can be done.

We arrived early after disembarking from the NCL Pride of America and were told to check back in around 1:00 and that our room should be ready no later than 2:00... Great! No problem! We chose to leave our bags with the hotel and explore Waikiki a bit. We eventually found a bar to enjoy some lunch and drinks before heading back around 1:00 to check on the status of our room. We waited around in the lobby and close to the hotel afterwards as we were looking forward to a quick rest and a shower before exploring more of Waikiki on one of the three nights we had. At 3:00 (check-in time) we checked in with the front desk to see if our room was available, and after much confusion (""Yes, your room is ready and your bags are in the room... Oh wait..""), we looked down the hallway to see the cleaning crew had just gotten to the room to begin cleaning it. Finally, around 4:30, we walked into our room to find no bags, which only showed up after multiple calls and visits to the front desk. We finally received our bags around 6:00 pm, only to have felt like an entire day of our vacation was wasted by waiting on the hotel. Please - just level set expectations with your guests. If we had been told that our room wasn't going to be ready until 3:00, we would have explored the city until 3:00. We stayed in one of the cabana rooms, which as with many of the experiences at this hotel, I'm conflicted about as I reflect on it. On a positive note, these rooms are conveniently located on the same floor as the lobby, meaning we didn't have to deal with the elevator issues, but along with this came a definite lack of privacy and noise. Should you choose to stay in one of these rooms, be prepared to have the fan running in your room at all times to block out the noise of the hallway as well as the pool. We spent a ton of time on our balcony area, sitting in the chairs, but so did everyone else. **Note to management - please for the privacy of the guests who pay extra to stay in these rooms, indicate that the chairs are for room guests ONLY, and not for everyone.** I lost count of the number of times that we opened our curtains (which typically had to remain closed while we were in the room because of the traffic of the pool) only to find people sitting in the chairs, staring back at us. To be fair to those individuals, it's not clearly marked. I feel we spent way more time outside than we would have with a traditional balcony, and for that I'm grateful. The room itself was large, although missing amenities that many others have already touched on (in room coffee maker so I didn't have to pay $4 for a cup in the morning, towel hooks, better lighting, etc.). Other items to note: -Breakfast was delicious, although expensive. -Many members of the staff are incredible and genuine, I firmly believe our negative experience was only with a few staff members and should not be a reflection on the whole. I apologize that I can't remember names, but some of the people we dealt with were fantastic and wanted to make amends for the issues we encountered. -The pool area looks incredible, but from a functionality perspective, misses the mark. It is shady most of the day, and the chairs that are available are taken quickly in the morning, something I attempted to do twice only to have someone else take over the chair while I went back into my room to put on a bathing suit and apply sunscreen. -While the beach is ""close"", it's definitely a walk, and it's difficult to find a place to enjoy it. Keep that in consideration when booking this hotel if your preference is to lay by the pool/beach all day. This probably isn't the hotel for you.

I arrived at 1:30p and the room wasn’t guaranteed until 3p, but I attempted to check in regardless. It took 20+ minutes to wait in line to check in, which was the first display of their disorganization.They told me they would call me when the room was ready, but that it would be ready by 3. (Understandable) At 3:20 I got in line again, and patiently waited while they tried to find me a room. They called housekeeping, verified that a room had been “inspected” and then finally handed me keys. However, when I got up to the room, housekeeping was in there and said that the room had a problem (a horrible chemical smell that they couldn’t identify or fix) and said that I couldn’t stay in that room. So they sent me back down to check-in. At this point, a manager upgraded me to a junior suite and apologized profusely. That’s part of the reason this is tough to write, because all of the staff I encountered were friendly, helpful, and went above and beyond!! But...The room was noisy, and I could hear traffic on the street as well as in the halls, at all hours of the day and night. In addition, I must have been close to the kitchen (though I was on the 7th floor) because there was always a bevy of fresh cooked smells wafting through my room. (Not as enticing or enjoyable as it may sound)But, again on the positive side, they had great entertainment and a host of fun activities that took place downstairs, as well as a phenomenal location. However, there are so few pool chairs, that I never got to enjoy the pool, despite the fact that I wanted to. See what I mean??? CONFLICTED. All in all, I don’t think I would stay here again. I visit Honolulu 3 - 4 times a year, and there are plenty of other places in the same price range that are a far better value for the money, with much quieter rooms and a closer walk to the beach.

We have been to Hawaii before - but we had never found a home away from home that we would be prepared to return to, until now! You will have read all about the charming décor, gift basket and very cool mid-century make-over that the hotel has had. The renovation looks like real quality work, and I expect it will continue to look as lovely as it did when we arrived only months after it re-opened. Usually, we stay in apartments so we have a bit of space and privacy, but this time, as we were only in Waikiki for a week, we decided to all bunk into the one room. I can say that even with three of us, it was enough room. The huge and comfy king size beds did not feel as though they consumed the entire room, and there was plenty of bench space on the cool Eames style wall shelves. For me - there was not enough lighting in the room. That makes for a lovely moody space, but at night, when trying to read a book on the side of the bed that does not have a bedside table, it is difficult. Perhaps a sconce light over the 'outside' edges of the beds could be helpful. The only other thing that could be improved - as everything else was perfect for me - was that there was nowhere to hang towels in the bathroom. The bathroom is just beautiful - really stylish down to the finest detail .... except for the practical matter of hanging your towel (or lovely gown that is also supplied) after your shower. Again, no big problem, but noticeable when there are three of us using the space.There were plenty of coat-hangers, towels, glasses and really nice quality bath accessories. You can't always assume those sorts of things will be in plentiful supply, so it was fab to have all that on tap. Added to all this, the staff were mostly lovely, although sometimes, some staff seemed too preoccupied or unable to assist readily, and room service choices for in-room dining could have been better with some simple meals or snacks to have in-room after a long day out. The ABC stores next door were good enough for that though!The location is the best in town, in my opinion, having stayed in several other high profile properties and areas over the years. Our room on the 10th floor was surprisingly quiet.I am already hoping to come back to Hawaii, and next time I do, we will absolutely want to stay at the Laylow Hotel.Thank you all for a fantastic holiday!","Sydney, Australia","torneyteam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",16,5.0

Was given a nice upgrade to a suite(more like a junior suite) as a Gold member. Stayed 7 nights. Felt the amenity fee was weakly justified but that is not unusual. Vouchers for the restaurant for Gold members in lieu of a lounge is nice but it is a shame they are no longer allowing the vouchers to be used for alcohol. Also it seemed like every waiter handled these vouchers differently. It is not a luxury hotel but is fairly comfortable.Location of the hotel is great if you do not need to be right by the beach. Staff were nice.I am giving this a 2 rather than a 4 or 5 though as I was annoyed when I was denied the Gold/Platinum member 4pm guaranteed late checkout ""because they are a resort"". While hotels classified by Marriott as resorts certainly do not have to offer the 4pm late checkout, I had researched this hotel beforehand and was almost certain it was not classified as a resort. On checking with some people after and on the Marriott resort directory, I got confirmation that this is definitely not classified as a resort by Marriott(hence the daily ""amenity fee"" and not ""resort fee""). I really do not like hotels lying to try to get out of the guaranteed 4pm checkout. Thankfully most Marriotts are very good at honoring this benefit. I appreciate that giving this benefit in Waikiki with so many red eye flights might be difficult but these benefits are part of the deal they make when they affiliate with Marriott. They should do better. We ended up changing our flight to a morning flight in part because of this.","London, United Kingdom","Robert K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",27,2.0

They give us a room with one King and a ""sofa"" that's really not meant for sleeping on. We ask for the room we booked with that bedding plus a queen. Sorry, they say, we thought you only had 2 in your group, so we gave you enough bedding for 2. The marriott website doesn't allow you to list your kids, just how many ""guests' you have. This hotel charges for guests 3 to 5 IF they are ADULTS, so we put down 2 guests. I pointed out that as Gold members, we are entitled to the bedding we booked. Nope, sorry, they are full. Could they bring us a rollaway? Nope. Could they bring us a spare mattress (plenty of room for it) from a bed or the cushions from a sofa not in use. Nope, they claim that housekeeping has NONE. Really? I don't believe it. Anyway, they refused to honor the bedding gurarantee, or to give the $100 compensation that's the minimum Gold members are entitled to when they don't get the bedding they booked. They waived a $35 fee, and gave us pillows and blankets to our kids could sleep on the floor. Totally unacceptable, but it was Christmastime and there was nowhere else to go, so we put up with it for one night.Next day, we said we are checking out, and asked for the 4pm ""guaranteed"" late checkout. The woman at the desk claimed that his guarantee was subject to availability (it's not) and that she couldn't do anything past 1. After about ten minutes of arguing, I was about to show her the dictionary definition of ""guarantee"" when another clerk intervened and gave us the 4pm checkout. Because there was nothing else available for a family in the city, we decided to leave the island early, so the hotel ruined our vacation.I then mentioned to the manager that we are entitled to the $100 for not getting our bedding, and after disappearing into his office for 20 minutes, he finally came out and said no, because how was he to know that we had more than 2 people in our party? Hello? The guarantee isn't dependent on how many people you have in your party. What if we weren't a couple, and wanted the king and queen so we'd each have a nice size bed? And is it our fault that Marriott doesn't let you specify that you have kids coming with you?The only good fortune we had with the hotel is that we were on the 3rd floor, as one of the 2 elevators was broken, leading to huge lines, so we walked instead. Near as I can tell, the hotel offered no compensation beyond a meager apology for making guests either wait 10-20 minutes each time they wanted to use the elevator, or walking up and down the stair--the hotel has some very high floors!Did I mention that you can hear the music from the lobby in your room when you try to sleep?This is by far the worst experience I've ever had at a Marriott, with the absolute worst, ill-trained staff.BTW, if they had had a queen bed, it apparently would have been similar to the incredibly uncomfortable ""Sofa"" that was in our room. This hotel is not built to accommodate more than a couple, regardless of their claims on their website to have rooms for 5.Finally, instead of giving Gold members breakfast, they give a voucher of $15 for a single, $30 for a couple for their restaurant--but nothing on their menu is $15 or under, so the breakfast isn't free.STAY AWAY!","Potomac, Maryland","David B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Potomac, Maryland</strong>",94,1.0

I picked this hotel because it said it was a Marriott hotel. This is not a full size Marriott hotel it’s just a boutique hotel. As a Platinum Marriott member this was not a Great idea for me to book this hotel! They don’t treat you any better or upgrade your room. They said I would have a Mountain View high up and we had a view of a parking lot! I also asked for two connecting rooms as I have a kid who has special needs and we will be in the rooms a lot. It why I wanted a room with a view and connected. For 5000.00 USD I expected more. When I sent an email to the management they called me and offered me some Marriott points and Champaign. They had no idea or seemed to even care they have really messed up my only family vacation. I don’t want points I want the room I reserved! To add to the bad things. They left our luggage in the rain and I put it out of the rain myself but somehow they put it back in the rain! So don’t bring your Gucci or Chanel suitcases The second of only two elevators didn’t work for 3 days! So we had to walk up and down the stairs! Because the elevator line was so long. When we checked out I called for a bell boy to get our bags. They didn’t show up so again I carried my bags. They I saw him in the lobby and asked him for help with my bags he sent to me to the front desk and she told me I had to carry my stuff to the valet myself again! And he didn’t help get my wife’s suitcase and she has to also carry her own stuff. So long story short only stay here if you are not a Marriott member who expects the same great service at the Marriott hotels any place else. Good stuff the rooms are big and nice and clean. Room maids did a Great job and always said hi when we saw them. The bartender was Great made me a drink that was very very strong The lobby is nice but small.

The location is convenient to beaches, shopping, restaurants, and night life. In addition, the property is chic with a vintage-Hawaii decor that includes a ukulele in each room. Unfortunately, there is no lounge.I chose the Laylow for our stay because I am a Marriott Rewards member, and it was an Autograph Collection property with good online ratings. Unfortunately, the property did not live up to the hype. While the property looks fantastic and flashy, the staff and facilities left much to be desired.The property has two elevators for guests to reach their rooms. One of those two elevators was broken for four out of our five nights on property. It made for long waits for the elevators and cramped quarters in the elevators themselves. In addition, the elevators are secured, meaning you need a room key to reach your floor. It's great for security, but it's not so great when the elevator is stuffed with guests, and you can't get to the panel. Also, it made things difficult for guests with luggage, whether checking in or out.The room was nicely appointed with two king beds and the amenities included robes, a safe, an iron & ironing board, a refrigerator, & spa toiletries. The bathroom was nicely laid out and finished with nice materials. The shower was especially large, and the it had good water pressure and instant hot water. The one downside for me - I found hairs in multiple towels and under the cap of a bottle of conditioner. It was off-putting for me.The Front Desk Staff and the Concierge were fantastic. They always greeted us with smiles and friendly interactions. I took advantage of the Concierge service to book some activities, and Meena was excellent.The Valets/Bellmen, on the other hand, seemed disinterested and not very well trained. On multiple occasions, they simply handed me a car key when I gave them my claim ticket. Thank goodness it was for the correct car. However, my biggest issue was with their attention to details...or lack thereof. From 40+ minutes for baggage assistance to messing with the driver's seat in the car, they didn't seem to be concerned with the finer details. And for me, the details make the difference.The Laylow is a nice property, but I cannot justify returning when there are so many other great properties in Waikiki.","Atlanta, Georgia","371ricardoh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",4,3.0

Not too far from Waikiki beach, 10 min walk. Next door to International Market Place and a large array of restaurants in the area. I was lucky to get a room as soon as I arrived at the hotel after arriving at 7:30am. Not bad.Room was nice, looks just like the pics on the website, plenty of space but... I booked a room on the Ho'okipa Level and thank goodness I booked breakfast as the complementary food on the level was so basic it was more grab and go and should be stated as such. In fact they leave you bags to take the food away. The food/drinks area is in the middle of the hall located between the rooms so if you want a coffee super early your likely going to wake half the floor!! There is no signage to tell you what is what and whilst most items are easily identified until I used the taps I didn't know one was for soda water and other two were just filtered water. Coffee was ok but no stirrers provided and as no cutlery in room how was I to stir my sugar?? There's a bar fridge in the room - empty for you to fill as you wish. A basket with thongs, water and snacks but again nothing to say that it's complimentary! Water bottles are not replenished as I guess you are supposed to refill your bottle using the taps in the hallway!The bed is waaaay too soft and uneven in firmness. Plenty of pillows to choose from thoug so that's lucky! Also plenty towels etc in bathroom, although I did get child size towels on a couple of days - so small I wasn't sure what happened! Breakfast is ok, but can be slow even with the number of staff.

Property is in a great location (unless you want beachfront), close to many great places to eat and shop. Whoever did the decorating for the property gets a gold star. Very retro, hip and funky rolled into one. Room itself was not very large (we had a corner ""suite"" which was not really really a suite, but the bed was comfortable and the balconies were great. Bathroom is nicely done, but very small.Check in was methodical and not overly friendly. Remaining staff was hit or miss, with some seeming to enjoy their role and interacting with guests, and others not so much. (Managers roaming the property were very engaging) Marriott status did get food vouchers after asking, but not much else. (FYI for lounge access, upgrade expectations etc.) Resort ""fees"" are commonplace at resorts and while you do not care for them, you pay it, hope to recoup your money while on property and move on. Resort fee seems in part to augment the base room rate. You do get a cool welcome basket, but you are paying for it. Other ""perks"" I remembered was use of a bike (we only saw one) and $50 off $100 spend with the concierge which we did not use. Overall, we were happy, just trying to capture our experience. This was our first overnight in Honolulu after many in Maui.

Most of the staff was pleasant and professional and the concierge was especially helpful. When checking in it was hard to communicate with the front desk due to the loudness of the lobby during a weekend evening. Although those who want to be part of the action will appreciate the nighttime activity in the hotel, the sounds which emanate from it can still be heard on high floors. Although bookings through the concierge receive $50 off $100 in spending, for two people who wanted to visit some parts Pearl Harbor. it might not be that easy to utilize. The concierge suggested adding some things to our activities that we might not otherwise have chosen in order to reach the $100 figure. Overall, I liked the hotel but thought that it was worth pointing out that someone who is a Platinum Starwood and Marriott member might be disappointed in the status benefits offered. Although platinum members are guaranteed lounge access and breakfast for two and offered space available upgrades, I believe the hotel's approach is to minimize its offering of benefits. Since there was no coffee machine in my room or in the lobby, it would have been nice to have access to a lounge where I could make coffee before the restaurant opened. Although the executive floors have a coffee machine, filtered water and some minimal food offerings, I was initially told only guests upgraded to those floors receive access. The explanation offered was that as an Autograph collection hotel, they are different. A brief review of Marriott's policies would show that Autograph collection hotels are not exempt from providing stated benefits. Even if the counter is not considered a lounge, it would have cost the hotel little to offer gold and above members access to it without debate. The $15 per person food and beverage credit is a marked improvement from what some reviewers had claimed was the hotel's attempt to substitute the offerings on the executive floor for the required offering of continental breakfast for gold and higher members. Some Marriott hotels, including Autograph collection ones, provide a full breakfast or at least a substantial continental breakfast. Increasing the credit by $5 or $10 per person would make this hotel more competitive.",New York,"Rny321</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",75,4.0

We had stayed in Waikiki several times before as stop overs to shop after staying on the other islands. We figured that it was more financially expedient to stay one block back from the main strip. What a marvellous decision!! The rooms were what the website indicated (small but clean, tidy and a little funky, i.e. ukele, etc) but what the internet doesn't tell the you is that the staff are great, the little pool is just right and the proximity to the International Market, Maui Brewing Co., PF Chang's as well as the Cheesecake Factory means you are central without too much noise!! Awesome bar service during evening drinks - thanks Seth (he remembered our drinks) and Cassandra (Irish?? accent) for keeping tired Aussies happy. Jarren at reception who was polite, patient and very professional - thumbs up, it was a busy day that we arrived. Richard our concierge who helped with arranging massages, etc and still remembered our names whenever we walked past!! The pool staff who made sure they refreshed guests with NA drinks and did NOT hassle us to buy cocktails AND provided sunscreen - Australians are big on that. Finally - each corridor has a coffee, tea juice, ice station with snacks for guests to grab on their way to their rooms, this was a nice touch. The only downer??.. The morning of our departure - the fire alarms went off and instead of letting guests know it was a false alarm within several minutes, it was announced when many of the guests had already run down (in our case 15 flights and we ran back up because the lifts were taking too long) to the EEP....luckily we had a 7am departure.

The location is excellent, a mere 20 minutes from the unfathomably lousy international airport, seconds from the shops of the International Market Place, and minutes from the high-end boutiques of Kalakaua Avenue and the Kapiolani beach. In other words, it is in the heart of the place to be. The hotel offers 16 floors of stylish, comfortable accommodation in what is billed as a throwback to 1960s glory as might be experienced in Miami or Las Vegas. The hotel’s aesthetic matches its claim, but the overall feeling is one of underwhelming achievement. The property could and should do more, but it doesn’t. The “suite” is an example of the disappointment. I booked what unfortunately is the “best” and “biggest” room, which begs the question of what a standard room offers. The room boasts two balconies, one of which affords a commanding view of a neighbouring car park and the other a narrow ocean view. To be fair, this isn’t a beachfront hotel and so its nice to see the water at all. What really disappoints is the daily “Destination” fee for activities. The best way to describe it is as extortion, as the partner offers are of dubious value. I had to pay $50 daily for the convenience of WiFi that I’d have received for free anyhow and for other so-called amenities like pool towels, access to the gym, and daily newspapers. If I wanted Ukulele lessons, then I’d have paid for them separately. The fee should be optional at a property that isn’t anywhere close to a resort.

Room walls are paper thin and doors don't fully close. Have to pay for water. I picked this hotel for a business trip. I usually stay at Hilton Waikiki Village or Marriott Waikiki, but decided to try something new. The facilities at Laylow is pretty neat and the decoration is kinda weird given that it's in tropical Hawaii and their interior looks like IKEA European modern style. I was given a room on 9th floor at first, but I soon noticed the walls were paper thin and I was sharing a door with the next door and I could hear them talking clearly as if they were in my room. So I requested an upgrade by paying $20 more per night to get changed to 15th floor that they called the ""executive floor"". 15th is supposed to have free drinking water in the hallway, but the tap was broken the whole time I stayed. I also noticed that when the room door closes, there's a gap around the door and if you turn off the light, you can see a square of light coming through the gap, which is lights up the room at night and is very annoying. Location of the hotel is good though. I requested for complementary water, and got a response from the front desk (she also frowned upon my request rudely) that I could go to the bar and buy one at $5. Oh hell no. I ain't paying $250 per night to also pay for a bottle of purified water, this is crazy talk. Hilton and Marriott both have free waters at front desk and offer them to you at request. Here, no. And they make it sound like you are the crazy one. 15th noise level was better, but most rooms are facing the parking lot so you dont get any view. My suggestion is that if you are paying $250 anyways, go to Marriott or Hilton. They at least offer complementary upgrades and you can usually see a corner of the ocean at least. Upon checking out, I asked the front desk to put my small carry on with them and I'll be back to pick it up in 30 min. I stood there for 10 minutes when I watched Kimberly assisted customer after customer who were checking in and left me completely to the side. Finally I questioned whether they were always treating members like that and girl named Stephanie roller her eyes when she heard it. Bet these people got hired here because Laylow is newly opened and cannot find anything better than Kimberly and Stephanie. After finishing assisting customers who came way later than me at the front desk, Kimberly wrote me a tag, which only took less than 30 seconds. Then she rolled her eyes and apologized to the customer in front of her. EXCUSE ME?! This Laylow front desk overall is definitely NOT ALOHA SPIRIT, and they always seem to push back on your simplest request that you take for granted at other resorts. I won't be coming back, and will stick to my regular Marriott.","Hong Kong, China","monnikka</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",10,2.0

We didn't use the pool as we went shopping before catching our flight home. There's a noodle place opposite the hotel which has a huge queue at all times!

You get the consistency of Marriott service and standards with an intimate, local, boutique feel. Rooms were new and clean. Loved the pool area. Service was amazing and food was also really good. Check-in - Since it's a smaller hotel, early check-in is probably unlikely unless you have status and request before hand. Also don't think they have a hospitality suite but they do have nice, clean restrooms if you wanted to change/freshen up. Vibe - We loved the vibe at the hotel and ended up spending most of our time hanging out there by the pool. We found it much calmer and relaxing than the 1,000+ key resorts in the area and with a much more laid back/local vibe. While we didn't love Waikiki, we would be tempted to go back just to stay at this hotel again.Location - Great, central location. Next door to an ABC Store that opens at 7am and a lot of casual and higher end food options in the new International Marketplace. Also across the street from Marukame Udon so you can go at odd times when there is no line (we thought it was pretty good but not worth more than a 10-15 minute wait). Would also recommend Boss Tea for bubble tea right across the street and the Hula Dog food truck a few blocks down Kuhio. Really easy to get a taxi/uber but also walkable to the farther attractions Diamond Head (45 minutes), Ala Moana Center (30 minutes). F&B - Had breakfast a few mornings as well as drinks and food out by the pool. Food was always delicious and prices are reasonable for Waikiki. My personal favorite was the breakfast skillet fried rice and kalua pork egg rolls. Bar pretty lively at night and they have live music and lots of areas to just sit and chill. Pool Area - Small with some loungers, chairs and two cabanas but guests are pretty good about not reserving spots so we never had any issue getting a spot. On weekend afternoons, we would occasionally have to chill on a chair or in the pool for 15-20 minutes before a lounger opened up. During busier hours they have servers for food and drinks and when they don't, very easy to pop over to the bar and order yourself and they will bring it over. We were there in October so due to orientation of nearby buildings, best sun in the pool area was from 11am-3pm. Free shaved ice in the afternoons!Service - Everyone we interacted with was friendly and professional, especially the front desk staff and the servers.Only note is that we found housekeeping to run on a really late schedule so if you want your room cleaned before you return from the day's activities, would recommend calling and requesting a cleaning on your way out. Rooms - New, modern, clean, and well-furnished and thoughtfully decorated. The welcome basket upon arrival (ours had flip flops and snacks) was a nice touch. Only very minor comment on the bathrooms was there weren't enough hooks / towel racks so between the two of us, we had to get creative with towels, wet bathing suits, etc.",,sying775,8,5.0

Bell staff and valet were very nice, front office was a little dry (most of them don't even smile - it's Hawaii!). Very young staff, which I believe need more training on brand and customer service standards. I decided to extend one more day in Hawaii, so I was advised to stay in the same room (corner king suite) I liked the suite for the most part (bathroom was small). So I asked the front desk if they can send extra water bottles, she told me she can't do that as it's basically one stay and water bottles are scarce(something to that context) I mean how could that be? It's a freakin hotel! She did offer me a drink in a cup. While on the elevator, I could overhear another elite member saying that their lounge sucks, I was like they have a lounge?! He said yeah it's only for platinum members its on the 16th floor. NO ONE TOLD ME THIS. I quickly went downstairs and asked about it, and the reason why I (a plat elite) didn't have access to it. She told me it's only for elite members staying on that floor, I told her that's unacceptable because a lot of the people who were going there didn't stay on the 16th floor. She told me that she'll give me comp access this one time. This was so weird. On my last day, I called SEVERAL times to have my room made, and I'm not exaggerating this, I mean several I told them I was heading out to dinner. So come to find out once I got back up to the suite, my room has not been made at all! I called clearly upset and told the front desk emp(male) this, he said that it's weird why they missed it. So he offered 5k points into my account I said, yes, that would be great. A couple of days after my stays posted, NO 5,000K BONUS POINTS. What is it?! SO many excuses, like no water, they missed your room (several times), poor customer service from front desk. This is by far the worst hotel service Ive received with my elite status and surprisingly it's in Hawaii where people are supposed to be warm and friendly (I come from an island too). Plus no parking fee waiver for elites. They should just charge once for a stay. I get that this is a new hotel, but this being an autograph brand, you should up your standards, invest in a better lounge, give complimentary breakfast (not coupons) and retrain your staff. Otherwise category level should be lower IMO.Some positive points:AGM was friendly enough, she was helping out with the shaved ice service.

It is right across the street from the notable restaurant, Marukame Udon. It is a 10-minute walk from the world-famous Waikiki Beach. Would not recommend for anyone that wants to be right on the beach. It is however a short walk or even shorter Uber ride away. Check-In is an escalator ride up from Kuhio Ave. The hotel is right next door to Michael Mina’s establishment, The Street. If you were walking on Kuhio, you probably wouldn’t notice Laylow as it tries to encompass the concept of its’ title, a place where you can lay low in the chaos of Waikiki. It’s bar Hideout has a similar concept. Once you reach the top of the escalator, you’re greeted with mid-century furniture and leafy palms. On the lobby floor, you’ll find the Restaurant, Bar (Hideout), Coffee Shop, Saltwater Pool, Gift Shop, and where your clients check in. The saltwater pool provides infused water and cocktail service from the bar. They also include complimentary shave ice. Fun fact: Hawaiians don’t call it shaved ice, for some reason they knock off the d. Reason for a 4: Long wait time at The Hideout for Guests and no Hawaiian coffee at the coffee bar. Room: Sync your phone up to the TV and play music from the Bluetooth connection. Included in the $25 Resort Fee are complimentary snacks, thongs or slippers (flip flops), and a ukulele in your room. You can bring the ukulele downstairs to the lobby for complimentary lessons. The rooms are uniquely designed with palm print wallpaper and certain quirks: books from authors on Hawai’i or Hawaiian authors. Maak (pronounced make) bath products are inspired by the native flora of the region and are specific to the Laylow. I.e., you will not find their smell anywhere else. Every room or suite has a lanai. Con: The coffee shop does not serve Hawaiian coffee. How is that so? It is the only state in the U.S. that can grow coffee commercially. I would recommend reconsidering the lighting as the rooms are slightly dim. I would also recommend reserving a few sofas at Hideout for Guests Only as our group had to wait over 15 minutes when many sofas were available. All in all, I would highly recommend.","St. Petersburg, Florida","Meghan F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Petersburg, Florida</strong>",11,4.0

Summer, the hotel manager, was nothing short of superb as she was able to answer all of our questions and accommodate our needs. We did not reserve a suite; however we did get two King Deluxe Rooms and they were just right for 7 women. Upon arrival they provided a delicious, fresh mango snack and fragrant hand towels, which were a nice touch. Inside each room they had a complimentary basket of snacks, as well as two free pairs of super cute ""slippahs."" The breakfast was literally the best free hotel breakfast I've ever had because you can use your credit at their coffee shop, which has amazing coffee and ridiculously scrumptious baked goods. The pool is smaller compared to other chain hotels, but it was perfect for us and not crowded at all. The lounge chairs inside the pool were great and the beach towels are really cute! The location is perfect as it is right across the street from Marukami Udon (over 6k reviews on Yelp!), next to the International Market with shops and restaurants, next to Nordstrom Rack, and a short walk to the beach. The decor is tropical chic and I would hire their interior designer in a second for my own home. The only feedback I would give is that the rooms need a little more lighting and the Friday night bartenders could have been a little more friendly (told us they couldn't serve us from where we were standing and already waiting for 20mins). Other than that, the Laylow was excellent and I will definitely stay there again. ",,Ivy Q,1,5.0

The rooms on the concierge level were fabulous and we were greeted by a welcome basket of flip flops, cookies, dried fruit and taro chips. The outdoor restaurant bar overlooking one of the main streets gave you a beautiful view of downtown and had nice outdoor fire pits to relax by. The poke ( Asian ahi tuna and rice dish) was wonderful as was the breakfast. The hotel is conveniently located in the center of everything and just a couple blocks from Waikiki beach. Plenty of shops and other restaurants to choose from. We loved the outdoor wading pool and the comfortable lounge chairs. The staff was very good and do meet Richard Guerrero, their concierge. He made our trip so enjoyable and was full of great ideas where to go and what to do. Would stay there again in a minute.

Our room was attractively appointed with cute touches like complimentary flip-flops and a golden pineapple that I was tempted to take home with me. The bed was very comfortable with nice linens and they didn’t skimp on the towels like some hotels. The Good: spotless room, nice staff, and valet attendants were super helpful (even offering food recommendations). The Bad: Noise. Located in the heart of Honolulu you hear street noise and walls weren’t terribly thick. We had the misfortune of being in a room on the 15th floor located directly across from a mini-bar of sorts that held their continental breakfast offerings of coffee, fruit, and pastries. Every morning we were awakened at 5:00 am sharp with the sounds of the staff clanking containers and refilling their coffee machine. After an hour of that noise then came the patrons standing around and talking as they got their coffee. The idea that a food station would not interfere with the peace of guest rooms nearby, is incredibly short-sighted and unrealistic. We asked to be moved to another room, but the hotel was full. When we checked out a savvy staff member compensated us for the inconvenience, but I had to fight for it. I can’t emphasize enough what a poor design this is, so if you book an Executive Suite be sure that you don’t get placed next to that bar!","Portland, Oregon","pickipicki</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",4,3.0

The hotel room has very nice decor. Nice large tv with many different channels. The bathroom is very nice as Well. The bed however is quit horrible. The bed is hard, the pillows are High and very bad, the duvet is synthetic fibers, bed not at all up to par with other hotels in the marriott family. Af is working nicely though. Just arrived home first evening. Room not cleaned, beds not made etc. Talked to reception, they where not sure if they Could manage a cleaning Now. They asked if i had put the sign on this morning, to which i answered yes, untill noon. The reply was that when they see the sign, they do not Make up the rooms. There is a sign in the room saying that cleaning is from 9am to 5 pm, hmmm that is kinda strange.The breakfast is a la carte. We had breakfast included for two. We are 3. Asked when checking in, they told me that breakfast was one entree and a non alcoholic beverage pr person, for two people. When asking the same question at the breakfast restaurant, the nice lady told me that we Could order what ever we wanted. I told her that sounded Strange. She Got what i Think might be the superviser, which told me we could spend 50 USD, and the additional was extra. Took her word for it. Would however have been nice with non conflicting answers.The breakfast is not to my liking. Way overpriced, Lots of fat laced options, and they are not quit sure what a Continental breakfast is. On the laylow it is coffee, juice and a Pastry at 13 USD. A Danish is 6 dollars.Pool area is very good for waikiki, with some treats during the day, like shaver ice water and the likes.The hotel staff is very nice, and the whole decor is authentic to Honolulu. The location is also quit nice.Would I stay again?

Let me tell you the place has changed. I noticed a few hotels going through makeovers. My guess would be to keep up with the International Marketplace. I decided to give the Laylow a chance after seeing it on Instagram. I give this a 5/5 on the IG meter. You pull up to the narrow valet driveway steps from the escalator that lifts you from the crowd. Once you step off into the open air lobby you see the simple clean interiors. The pool area is quaint. The most important staple for the modern day traveler is anchored right in the heart of the lobby...the espresso machine. The super adorable reception area with the hulah dolls. Have those trigger fingers ready on your smartphone. Like I said 5/5 on the IG meter. The feeling of ""I picked the right place"" hit me.The customer service of EVERYONE was EXCELLENT. From check in to check out, we were constantly greeted upon arrival and departure for the day's activities. Michelle who was constantly monitoring activities was so gracious and also remembered my boys' names and took the time asking how was their stay. A great touch!The room was clean and really well done. I thought the wood panel in shower was sick! BTW water pressure was great. The two kings (I think) were nice to come back to and sprawl out on after a day of activities. I even loved the books that were on the book shelves. Wifi signal was strong too. Whether you were in your room, lanai, pool or lobby.The hotel is close enough to plethora of restaurant. Too many to name. All you need to know is udon across the street and ABC about 40 feet from escalators. I ate breakfast one morning and pancakes and French toast were delicious.In the evening, the Hideout had a different performer nightly and the music was too 40's and every single one was awesome. Not your boring lounge singer that moaned the oldies. I enjoyed listening from my balcony some nights too. Here's the thing if you want a quiet night's sleep you probably shouldn't be within a four block radius of Waikiki. Have fun in the North Shore. Book your stay now! You won't be disappointed.

Our room had a ukulele which I learned to play on YouTube, ha ha. The decor in the rooms consists of open shelving with a bunch of books, the ukulele and other Hawaiian-themed things. However it would be nice if they put books on the shelves that were helpful or interesting for the guests! The ones in our room were weird and boring photo books. I guess they picked titles people would not want to steal. Hotel has a really tiny pool that is largely in the shade. They apparently serve shaved ice in the lobby but no one mentioned that to us. It is a LOOOOOONG convoluted walk to the beach (minimum 10 minutes if you walk really fast) from here. Don't stay here if you plan to spend a lot of time at the beach!! Also, bathrooms had NO towel racks to hang up wet bathing suits etc and the shower door went to the ceiling so that didn't work either. We thought this was a serious oversight in design. Our room was super quiet, which we loved. But the ice makers are all located on the lobby level, which we hated.

Loved that they had 2 king beds in one room. And the room came with complimentary snacks and 2 flip flops upon arrival. And they had towels on the pool area that we can take to the beach that is 5 minute walk. It's not a beach front property but we knew that. It is next to International Market that provided convenient food options nearby and shopping if you needed anything. Having ABC store next door was also great when I needed water bottles and snacks.Housekeeping did a good job overall and was pleasant to deal with. The 2 negatives I have to say was that we had a low floor and it was facing the pool. At night, there is music playing and you can hear some conversations and in the morning, you can hear cars and buses passing by. Being that this was the first island that we arrived to and we were jet lag so we were able to sleep anyway so we never asked for a room change. Not sure if the low floor assignment had anything to do with booking through Costco. I am a Marriott member but did not get any benefits since I didn't book directly with them. The second negative was the valet parking fee and resort fee. There is no self parking in garage and sometimes had to wait a few minutes to get your car even if you call early and getting into the valet check in, one time, the line was out the street. The resort fee, only thing I felt I benefited was the one time snack in the room and the one time I used towels to the beach. The pool though nicely kept was a bit small. Never knew about the shaved ice in the afternoon as was never told when I arrived. Never used the concierge and $50 activity credit as you need to spend $100+. Might be a nice discount for 2 person but we were a family with children. But I would still recommend this hotel if you are not looking for a beach front hotel. Just ask for a higher floor and hopefully you won't need the valet parking.",United States,"Jackjack706</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",17,4.0

Facilities and rooms were great. We arrived early so staff did their best to get us into a room as soon as possible, which we were very grateful for. However, after a day or two, I noticed there were many extra charges on my credit card for which there was no explanation. These charges were in the hundreds. The staff did their best to fix the issue and prevent it from reoccurring by removing my credit card, however, I wasn't able to get the funds back immediately which limited what we could do during our last days. To top it off, after we returned home, they charged AGAIN for the entire stay. The payments were returned a week later, however, as a young student, this was very inconvenient for me. Emailed but got no reply back. TV also didn't work for half the stay, requested twice for it to be fixed then broke again and wasn't repaired after another request. One of the women at the front desk was very good to us, tried to help as much as she could and waived destination fee but overall, not a very pleasant stay.","Hamilton, New Zealand","Ellie M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, New Zealand</strong>",0,3.0

We were qualified for a certain rate that was a great surprise in that it was all inclusive. Room rate, internet, valet parking, ""destination amenity fee"" and a $100 food and beverage credit. No extra charges or hidden fees upon checkout...very transparent and a nice change.Being Marriott Premier Platinum, hotels are usually very good to us. This hotel was no exception and they provided a room upgrade to a corner ""suite"" on a high floor. Always appreciated, but the ""suite"" was just a regular hotel room with a partition separating the bed and a couch/table. Regardless, it was nice of them to do and the room was perfect for the two of us. The staff at valet were a warm welcome, reception was a little slow as there was only on person on the desk at the time, but very pleasant once it was our turn. Since the hotel doesn't have a lounge, they offered bonus points or breakfast vouchers for the morning. The executive floors do have a small continental breakfast on each floor with juice, coffee, fresh fruit and pastries. While not typical, it was great for when we woke up and wanted to relax before going down for full breakfast. Speaking of full breakfast...the POG (Passion, orange, guava) mimosa was great and the Hideout Benedict with pulled pork instead of Canadian bacon was awesome! Also had the Nutella French Toast...ridiculously good.Having dinner plans elsewhere, we decided to enjoy some drinks at the Hideout (hotel bar) before heading out for sunset. Over walks our waitress Cassandra, who couldn't have been more full of life. She was awesome and a joy to talk with. We used our F&B credit to start the evening off with a bottle of Champagne while sitting out by the sand surrounded fire pit on the lanai. A nice way to wind down from the day and get your evening in Waikiki started,Didn't use the pool and it's rather small, but there is a pretty good sized pool a few blocks away. I like to call it the Pacific Ocean. Another observation was that the neighboring buildings started to shade the pool mid-afternoon.Staff the next morning at the desk were a little confused on how to accept a Marriott gift card. Still left the property without a finalized bill, but I'm sure the accounting department will figure it out.Car brought around and again, a pleasant interaction with the valet staff. A fond farewell was offered and smiles. I would definitely stay here again when we want a little break in Waikiki.","Honolulu, Hawaii","FiveStarHawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",93,5.0

I'd like to start with my initial meeting with the sales manager Patricia. The energy she brings is just what is needed while visiting Hawaii and this luxurious hotel. I met with her after a terrible stay at the Holiday Inn Express which is right down the street from the LayLow Autograph. During our meeting, she welcomed me with fresh fruit and food from their lounge area which is called the Hideout (details to come). She gave me a brief history about the hotel and the direction it is heading to. I was given the opportunity to sample some of the food that was made by the hotel Chef who is an amazing cook. Patricia also gave me a tour around the hotel and allowed me to see what the rooms will look like once I checked-in. Once I saw what the rooms looked like, my jaw dropped in astonishment because this was going to be my home for a few months. I was so excited!!!I must say from the minute I got out of my vehicle (Valet) and made it to the top of the escalator, I was highly impressed. Patricia did not have to say much about the hotel. I was sold already lol. Once you make it to the top of the escalator or elevator, you're introduced to the hotels ""Hideout at the LayLow"". It's a bar, restaurant and lounge area which is part of the hotel. This is definitely the place to be while visiting Waikiki. The managers Ben & Chandly (I hope I pronounced it correctly, so sorry) lol, are so awesome. They make you feel right at home. They greet you whenever you enter in the lounge area and seat you at your table. The Hideout has live entertainment 7 days a week which starts at 7 - 10 pm. They also offer a happy hour from 4-630 pm. On Friday and Saturday evening they have a live well known Dj who gets the party started from 9pm - 12am. They have a killer bar that has every drink known to man and also some of the hotels specialty themed drinks. The restaurant and bar closes down at midnight every night. The Hideout patio is filled with soft outdoor furniture which sits under the moonlight. Tiki torches are also lit to bring out the mellow ambience of the great people who partake at the Hideout. I'd like to recognize the employees at the LayLow Autograph that I can remember off the top of my head. This is in no particular order:Patricia, Ben, Chandly, Housekeepers, Victoria, Rachel, Hoku, Jarren, Leilani, Morgan, Cassandra, Daysha, Emily, Forrest, Seth, Shania, Trevor, Julie, Richard, Chefs, Cindy, Rita, The Entire Valet Crew, and Night Watchmen Crew.

Its a fun trendy hip hotel. The ladies at the front desk were full of ""aloha"" and really sweet to my kids. The lobby is the most fun with their hula doll collection and swings from the ceiling. The rooms are modern and chic. The only reason I give 4 stars is because of the pool area. The pool is on the smaller side and a basic rectangle with a few chairs inside. It is near the lobby and popular bar so its not very private. And gets shaded early because its surrounded by tall buildings. Besides the pool area I recommend this place!","Colorado Springs, Colorado","beautifulscent123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colorado Springs, Colorado</strong>",4,4.0

I have a peak-a-boo view of the ocean ... and the location feels convenient and pleasant ... albeit in an area of Waikiki that is becoming increasingly more gentrified (this hotel is certainly evidence of that - with a 60 million dollar stylish mid-century modern re-do of an Aqua brand hotel). Rooms are sleek and modern, but housekeeping could use a bit of consistency & standardization (felt like I got a different combination of towels and toiletries each day ... one day no washcloths, one day they didn't pick up old towels, one day no bar soap or body wash, one day a rubber bath mat appeared but no cotton bath mat ...??). No in room coffee ... but they will being a Kurieg to your room upon request. They have a daily resort fee ... which seems questionable for having only a salt water pool. Lovely front desk staff. Steps away from the International market, nestled between two great coffee chains, Pink line trolley stop, an ABC store & famous Udon shop next door ... and Maguro Bros. poke shop down the street. My kind of perfect in the bustle and hustle of Waikiki.","Norwood, Ohio","janebI5465FV</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norwood, Ohio</strong>",5,5.0

Facility-wise it's one of the best in the area.The issue I have is being Platinum Premier - by the time you figure in the $25 destination (free shaved ice is what you pay for) fee and the parking fees and the lack of a real lounge – it is actually cheaper to use your cross benefits with SPG and stay at the Sheraton Waikiki which waives the destination fee as well as the parking fee for Platinum members.The lounge is small and offers little more than snacks throughout the day and closes at 9 PM. They do offer a $15 breakfast credit but the breakfast downstairs runs around $20.I've grown weary of all the little tricks to nickel and dime customers – while I don't mind paying extra to stay in a nice hotel, I don't like paying extra then getting fee after fee on top of that with little recognition of Platinum Premier status.My suggestion to management is to improve your lounge – go to the Sheraton and you'll see a well run lounge - and waive fese for your Elite status folks - esp Platinum and up. I know you're new at this but it seems like you always have rooms available while some of the other hotels in the area do not...during a 2 week stay at the Sheraton in July I met 6 Marriott Platinums who chose the Sheraton for the same reasons - and all of us agreed we rarely if ever stay outside the Marriott brand...

Coin laundry and ABC store close by with a short walk to trolley and bus stop. I like the pool area even though it is a lap pool and others have reviewed it as small. Has 2 x undercover cabanas and adequate deck chairs and lounging chairs in pool itself. Free snow cones by pool daily after 1pm, beach towels provided. There were two of us and we had Junior Suite on the 5th floor with street view and small balcony which was adequate for us but not overly spacious. Shower caps not provided in amenities,however hairdryer and ironing board in room. No hanging hook in bathroom to hang clothing or towels. No tea/coffee making facilities in the room which was a negative for me as I don't want to go downstairs to cafe bar first thing in the morning. Hideout restaurant and bar nice and very popular with live music each night. Best to request a higher floor so music doesn't disturb you and street noises don't interrupt your sleep. As mentioned we were on Level 5 and heard music and street noise but we were prepared and had earplugs anyway so no problem. You can choose street view or pool view rooms. We arrived by taxi and the valet area had 3 staff working at the time of our arrival. All staff members were talking amongst themselves and only after we unloaded our bags did one staff member approach us to ask if we required assistance. No welcome greeting was extended and no direction given to the lifts or lobby area. Not the most welcoming customer service experience I would expect from a four star rated property. Working in the hospitality and tourism industry myself I pay particular attention to customer service standards wherever I go. Checking in at front desk was worry free, however I could not say any ""wow"" factor was evident and staff provided polite service but again no welcome greeting was extended. We had breakfast once at the property where we provided our room number but then decided to pay cash and discovered on checkout we had been charged again for our meal. In the end front desk staff deducted the amount from my account however it did take a few phone calls to the accounts area. On our last day at the property our room was not serviced which was also a little disappointing. Even with the issues I have listed I would and have recommend this hotel due to its location, price and nice modern appeal.

Most of the mid-range hotels had the exterior upgraded with not much attention to the rooms except carpet and paint to justify the prices they now charge in Waikiki. This hotel is an exception of that. It's now a Marriott hotel and a complete renovation has transformed this location to a centerpiece property adjoining the new International Market Place. The lobby has been re-done in natural wood and is now open-air. The pool in the courtyard is now resort style. The rooms are all refitted with Marriott standards with new tech and wi- fi. The bar downstairs"" The Hide-Out"" is now a premier meeting spot in Waikiki like there never was before. The elevators and parking has been re-done and even the sidewalk widened and lit up to highlight this new location. Centrally located and only a block to the beach.

Best feature: it's just a short walk to & from Canoes and Duke's which are ground zero for the best beach & surf action Waikiki has to offer. I rented a board and walked through the IMP, passing under the old monkey pod tree and treehouse which are still there, almost every day. So many fond memories of past visits to Honolulu here.The staff is super friendly and helpful. My 11' paddle board couldn't fit in the storage room designated for beach gear so the chief engineer graciously had it parked in his office.Only minor flaw is loudness of open-air lobby / restaurant / bar which offers live music and turns into a popular gathering place every night -- unless you're single in which case this is another plus. Definitely a hot spot.The suites are good size for up to five people. Ours had a sofa bed and queen size day bed in addition to a king, and a semi-separate kitchen area with two balconies.

He complains about the crowds, traffic and noise. However after stay at the Laylow he is willing to return. It is a beautifully redone hotel that is a block or 2 back from the main strip. There is a quiet road that you can walk down that is lined with little store kiosks to get to the main strip. So you are close enough to the action without being in it. The rooms we had were well appointed and so much larger then expected. I mean have you ever had 2 king beds in a room before? The welcome basket was great and we appreciated the free breakfast certificates because we are gold elite with Marriott (I had read complaints about the concierge breakfast offering before leaving, since they didn't mention having one and offered us free breakfast I'm guessing they got rid of it).

Whatever you could possible need is just a casual stroll away. The lobby situated on the second story with access via escalator. That gives you a slightly removed feel from the street traffic. No noise from the hustle below, whatsoever. The staff was very helpful and friendly. They really go above and beyond to ensure an enjoyable stay. The entire hotel has recently benefited from an update, with lots of attention paid to detail without being seeming too trendy or snobbish. Comfortable, relaxing and classy. Lots of space to relax by the saltwater pool. The pool appears to be more of an adult feel, with an rectangular shape that welcomes short laps back and forth. Once the weekend came, more kids took over and seemed to jump in and out, getting splashed in the process while sunbathing. I feel that's more of a parenting issue than a staff issue, however. Parents today seem to be buried in their cell phones instead of thinking about the other guests...Just a suggestion ;DThe room had a wonderful gift basket filled with flip flops, sweet potato chips, candy, etc. We have Elite/Gold Status with Marriott, so not sure if that comes standard for everyone. Fun books on Hawaii to read and picture books of Hawaii's history of surfing. It really felt like a home-away-from-home! Soft robes, comfortable beds, and delicious pillows to sleep the night away! Quite rooms, too! Didn't hear a peep from other guests at all. No coffee maker in the room, but one can be sent up if you'e like, free of charge. The coffee machine I requested was more like a Keruge (by the cup) style. We were given $15 per person with food/beverage vouchers a day to redeem, as well as $50 off any local activity you book with the concierge in the lobby. The food was scrumptious, breakfast, lunch and dinner! The views at the Hideout Bar was that of a rooftop get away (on second floor adjacent to the lobby area) along with a coffee lounge with barista's and bakery-like items. Lots of lounge seating around gas fireplaces in the center of every seating area, as well as traditional outdoor tables and chairs to choose from. We never had a reason to step outside of the hotel! One other daily fun treat included made-to-order free shaved icee's from 1:30-2:30 in the lobby.

I booked the hotel in February (before it even opened) but it was an available Category 8 hotel w/Marriott since I was browsing possibilities when I was planning my summer trip on the Marriott web site. I used Marriott Reward points for our entire 5-night stay (Marriott has an ongoing promo that if you use points to book 4 consecutive nights, you'll get the 5th night free).Hotel has valet parking only (no self-parking lot option). It was $35 a night & the garage is underneath the hotel (convenient but cars have to leave the garage & come out around the bldg to pull up to you which isn't far but there's a traffic light & pedestrian traffic to wait on).Lobby is up an escalator & is open (we didn't walk thru any doors). Check-in counter is small but 2 attendants available. We were on the 14th floor (there are 16, I think). A small balcony (ours overlooked the pool). We had a room w/2 king-size beds which were very comfortable. Bathroom is spacious but the door was a sliding door that has decorative (non-see-thru glass). It's very bright if someone turns on the light (w/the door closed) in the middle of the night to use it. Having the sliding bathroom door also doesn't accommodate a door hook to hang towels. Little options for the 3 of us to hang face cloths, bath towels or a hand towel. Not even a rod on the wall on either side of the bathroom sink/counter. I ended up using the arm of the pull-out make-up mirror for my face cloth. As much as we are ""green"", we preferred not to put our used towels on the floor so we could use them another day (but more than once, housekeeping replaced all our bathroom linens).This hotel does not recycle (& I asked thinking I could set all my recyclables aside for housekeeping to dispense). No dividers in the waste baskets for putting yogurt cups, styrofoam or plastic containers, et cetera).Furnishings were very simple but useful. Small fridge & no microwave (I couldn't even get the staff to heat up some restaurant leftovers for me). Balcony had two chairs & a small table. Shelving (like a bookcase) surrounded the flat-screen TV which had some ornamental objects & paperbacks. This was convenient for putting our ""stuff"".My sweetie & I went to the pool once. The wooden floor planks where the chaise lounges are were extremely hot on our bare feet. Towels are free (just sign the clipboard w/room # & how many towels). Sun is no longer on the pool by 1400 (& the pool isn't heated). There is a server that occasionally roams pool-side patrons to see if any beverage/food is needed.There is a restaurant in the lobby & my sweetie & I went there every morning for coffee (sweetie) & a caramel latte (me) (both were delicious). It does serve breakfast in the morning then lunch/dinner items after. There is live entertainment on some nights. I also asked (& was accommodated) everyday to fill our water bottles before we left the hotel on our excursions. Very convenient.I did use the workout room (which is by the pool). Spacious & lots of equipment (free weights, bench, yoga mats, medicine balls, treadmills, ellipticals, bikes). Water cooler & towels also available inside. Coming off the elevator, there are directional arrows to tell patrons which direction to go (lobby, pool, restrooms) but no arrow to tell you where the workout room is. So I ended up walking by the lobby, by the pool area to the workout room. When I came out of the workout room, I went the other way & the elevators are right around one corner (instead of 3).Hotel is located by a Starbucks, a small grocery store & plenty of restaurants all within walking distance. Lots of shops too (but I saved my souvenir shopping for the Swap Meet at the stadium).I used the concierge even before arriving to book a luau. There is a $50 voucher that is rec'd upon check-in to be used for any excursion booked thru the hotel. Since I already booked (& paid for) my luau, I had to bring the voucher to the concierge to receive a credit. Strange why this wasn't mentioned when I paid for the luau. I did receive a credit card statement. I am also glad I only booked one excursion thru the hotel. The base MWR has tix for everything. I am glad that I took Richard's advice on Diamond Head. I was going to book a guided tour & when I mentioned this to Richard when I booked the luau, he told me not to. It's $1 per person to get in (so I didn't get the guided tour or a certificate saying I went to the top but I saved money thanks to the concierge).Front desk was very accommodating & printed all our boarding passes the night prior to our flight.

The people were all friendly, restaurant was decent, small menu, like everything else in Hawaii, it's expensive. The location has lots of food around and the shopping is abundant. So why the zero star location? The street that this hotel resides on has 2 strip clubs across the street and hookers galore, homeless galore too, but they're everywhere else as well.

Was hoping that it would be nice, and overall it did not disappoint. I thought the location was great, close enough to the beach to easily walk there. Plenty of shopping and other eating establishments in the area. While waiting for our trip to arrive, I read the reviews as they grew in number. Yes, some things could be handled a bit differently especially for elite members, such as better controlling access to the 15th and 16th floors, but they kept the food offerings pretty well stocked. When the coffee machine went on the fritz, we could go downstairs to obtain one at no cost. It was promptly repaired. I had a corner room which had a small round table with two chairs and a bench along the wall, with USB and electrical outlets. So, it was well suited for working. When first arriving, the welcome package did not have the flip flops I had read about and seen in pictures. I had not brought any as I was planning on using those. I mentioned it at the desk and was told that they had run out and were awaiting more. Later that day, however, as I was passing the Concierge desk, I was stopped and informed that some had been located. My feet were happy! Mahalo.

Not a long walk at all and you're actually in the best part of Waikiki. The Laylow was just remodeled! Fresh and new!Pool was small but enough for us. The king-size adjustable seating mats made this more appealing and comfortable than the crowded beach. We regret not spending more time at the pool.

Both are great hotels for different reasons and both are very welcome additions to a tired Waikiki hotel scene. If you haven’t been to Waikiki lately, you will be amazed by how these two hotels and the all-new International Market Place next door have transformed Kuhio Ave. I actually preferred staying at these hotels over the beachfront resorts because, with the exception of Halekulani, the beachfront resorts are anything but chill plus I never sit on the beach anyway. Also worth noting that the Laylow and Hyatt Centric are not just next door neighbors but they seem to have the exact same target market, and it was clear that neither hotel wanted to be outdone by its neighbor (e.g., live music at the bar most nights, gift baskets upon arrival, welcome drinks, etc.), all of which benefit the hotel guests. The Laylow marks Marriott's return to the Waikiki hotel scene after the disastrous Waikiki Edition. It was formerly the 3-star Aqua Waikiki Wave and was extensively renovated and reflagged as a member of The Autograph Collection (as a side note, which, The Autograph Collection adds even more confusion to Marriott's already confusing hotel brands (for instance, in Los Angeles, the hierarchy of Ritz Carlton to JW Marriott to Renaissance to Courtyard to Residence Inn is clear as day as you drive down Olympic Blvd, yet in Phoenix, the Camelback Inn, arguably the most iconic Marriott of all, is branded as a JW Marriott and is much nicer than the Ritz Carlton, which was just re-branded as an Autograph Collection). Apparently the Autograph Collection designation is more about the uniqueness of the hotel than its level of luxury. It's also worth noting that the Laylow's sister hotel in Hawaii is the iconic Mauna Kea on the big island, which, along with the Kahala Hilton, was considered among the very finest hotels in the world. Anyway, who could have ever imagined that the Mauna Kea might one day not only end up in the same sentence as the former Aqua Waikiki Wave but also end up as its sister hotel?!?! But I digress...so let's get back to my Laylow visit:Pros:• An long exterior escalator transports you from the unassuming exterior of the hotel to an amazing open air lobby and pool area, which feels you have entered another world...an urban escape that somehow feels a million miles away from the madness of Waikiki below. Possibly the coolest lobby in Waikiki, especially because it’s so unexpected (think 10 Downing Street).• All rooms have private balconies. I realized what a big deal this was when I stayed at the Hyatt Centric the following week, where none of the rooms have balconies or even windows that open• Rooms seemed well-insulated except that the doors slam shut. Need to add a soft-close mechanism• Beds, pillows and linens are excellent• Location is perfect, especially with the recent opening of The Street social house, a high-end food court/social house on the ground floor (facing Kuhio) of the all-new International Market Place. • Room service (but hours are limited unlike at the Hyatt Centric next door, which has 24 hour room service)• Great restaurant and bar with live music on the terrace many nights• Awesome gift basket with many treats including my new favorite candy, Hi-Chew• Pool is stunningCons:• After checking in, I walked to the elevators and was suddenly reminded that this was an older hotel. It feels like the owners spent 80% of their renovation budget on the amazing lobby and pool, and the rest of the hotel (e.g., the hallways and, to a certain extent, the rooms) were an afterthought• The hotel and especially the rooms are a mix of luxury and kitsch. The lighting in the rooms is terrible, as they opted for these tacky outdated retro lamps with incandescent bulbs and no dimmers, which means you could choose between having the room as bright as a Target store inside or pitch black. Other furnishings include a futon sofa, which was fine, and a tacky lounge chair which was not at all comfortable. The designers should have opted for consistent luxury and quality instead of mixing in so much kitsch. Speaking of which, the Hawaiian dolls at the front desk in the lobby must go!• The bathroom was the same story. The plumbing hardware, vanity and lighted round wall mirror above the sink were of excellent quality; the fake wood-paneled shower was tacky and felt out of place. If they wanted a retro look, marble always works. There was also a very cheap small non-lighted vanity mirror attached to the wall which seemed like an afterthought. Overall, it felt a little bit like some corners were cut with finishes in order to meet a construction deadline, and hopefully this will change over time. The guest rooms themselves are actually better at Hyatt Centric except for the lack of balconies (I also had a suite at the Hyatt Centric so I'm not sure how the standard guest rooms compare).• Staff tried to be helpful and friendly but it was clear they were still learning. By comparison, the staff at Hyatt Centric was excellent and on it. In fairness to The Laylow, the hotel had literally just opened a few days earlier.• No ice machines in hallways, which means you have to call for ice every time you want it. This is a big deal to me. I loved how Hyatt Centric not only had ice machines but also water stations to refill water.• Another big deal to me was that room service is not 24 hours at the Laylow. Hyatt Centric has 24 hour room service.• Alarm clock was difficult to set and came with no instructions. I had to finally look up the owner’s manual online. It was not at all intuitive.Despite the cons listed above, I am still giving the Laylow a 5 rating because it’s such a unique and welcome addition to the Waikiki hotel scene. If you are looking for a chill spot to lay low and escape the madness of Waikiki, this is definitely it.If you are considering Laylow vs Hyatt Centric, it’s a really tough call and you really can't go wrong with either one. For me, I give the edge to Laylow because of the balconies. As much as I loved the Hyatt Centric, I’m not sure I would stay there again because of the lack of balconies or even windows that open, which seems crazy in Hawaii.","Los Angeles, California","JJ72LA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",23,5.0

It was quiet and a nice break away from the crowded feeling of Waikiki. So, if you are looking for a quality place to relax in the heart of the shopping and restaurants, it's great. If you are looking for a beachfront experience this is not it. It's a solid 2 and a half blocks to the sand of Waikiki beach. If you are looking for an expansive pool to take in the sun, this is not it.

Platinum status is supposed to mean something, but not at The Laylow.Management is cheating elites by breaking the spirit of Marriott's elite program rules. The complimentary breakfast is a joke. In fact, pretty much anyone can get access to the ""lounge"" for breakfast. The lounge isn't actually a lounge. It's just countertops and cabinets in a hallway on the ""executive level"" floor. The breakfast itself is pathetic -- by far the worst of any Marriott hotel. In fact, a no-frills Holiday Inn Express or even the Marriott brand Fairfield Inn offers a better breakfast. At The Laylow, all you get is free coffee and doughnuts. That's it. No yogurt. No oatmeal. No eggs. Nothing even remotely healthy. The hotel doesn't even provide coupons for a discount if one wants breakfast off the menu in the lobby-level restaurant. I skipped the restaurant as the prices were ridiculously expensive: $16 for a yogurt parfait and $8 for cereal. A cappuccino was $5, which is more expensive than Starbucks. Instead, I went to the Moana Westin and had breakfast, including coffee, juice and tip/tax, on their porch facing the beach for $23. ""Executive level"" rooms are also supposed to receive ""complimentary non-alcoholic beverages."" The only beverages were coffee, water and juice. The juice was gone by early morning. At every other Marriott hotel, this would include soda pop.The Laylow also charges a resort fee of $25 per day -- they call it an ""amenity fee."" I would have less objection to the fee if the hotel was actually a resort on the beach. It isn't. It's a city hotel located on a very busy street a couple blocks from Waikiki Beach. There are zero resort amenities. The rooftop pool is nice, but it's very small even by city hotel standards. Also, the pool doesn't get much sunshine because of neighboring buildings.Outside of these complaints, the recently opened and renovated hotel is a gorgeous example of mid-century modern architecture. I liked the design. It's just too bad that the management has decided to penny pinch.","Fort Wayne, Indiana","travelnonstop247</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Wayne, Indiana</strong>",355,2.0

We had three rooms at the hotel. We loved the location, and the public spaces of the hotel itself were nice. We were disappointed in the fact that after spending four nights in that hotel, our room was cleaned once, and our daughters' and sons-in-laws rooms were not cleaned at all, other than having the beds made. Even worse, they didn't empty the trash, didn't even wipe down the counters in the bathrooms and didn't take any dirty glassware or dishes away. Even though this is a newer hotel, opened in March 2017, the beds are well-worn and uncomfortable. When we asked the front desk about cleaning the rooms, several times, they apologized and said it shouldn't happen. Mind you, we had three rooms on three different floors, so the problem is throughout the hotel. The confusing and finicky elevators and room keys left people stuck in the elevators trying to figure out how the heck to get up to their rooms. The pool area was fine. Unlike some reviews we read, we did not have trouble finding a place to sit out by the pool. However, they have many large umbrella stands with no umbrellas and when we asked for one, they said they didn't have any as the ones they had were a safety hazard and they have not gotten new ones yet. Also, it would have been nice to have servers out by the pool area instead of having to go into the bar to order food or drinks poolside, even they did have a pile of pool menus to look at so you could go order. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone as I don't like spending that kind of money and not ever even seeing someone actually cleaning the rooms or vacuuming or taking the trash away.",San Diego,"Kashes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",5,2.0

There are plenty of stores, restaurants around it (the International Market Place itself is a shopping center, third floor offers a variety of restaurants and The Street on the ground level has different food stands and plenty of sitting room). The hotel bar has a great vibe, good happy hour, and it is a ""scene"" especially on weekends + they have live entertainment nightly which is a nice perk. The room was nice and spacious (we had a deluxe with 2 kings) and kept very clean and tidy. There was a welcome basket with flip flops and Hawaiian goodies waiting for us in the room which is a great touch. Staff is nice and friendly. Plenty of bus lines you can catch just a few steps away if you would like to explore Honolulu a bit (they take exact change only so have your $2.50 ready).

Most hotels that were on the beach had options for either a single king or 2 double beds. We really wanted to stay at the beach, but a single double bed for our two kids was a non-starter.The hotel is newly remodeled, and everything has a neat, clean look. The pool area was very well done, with a wood deck and wide, comfortable lounge chairs. There are also lounge chairs in the pool. This is a big difference from what we saw at the beach properties, where it seemed like the seating was arranged to cram as many people as possible into a small area. Another nice touch is that they have music playing at a volume level that is not too loud but loud enough to drown out traffic noise from the surrounding streets.The location of the hotel is excellent, with a lot of restaurants and shopping within a short walk. The beach is a short two block walk - maybe 10 minutes. If you really want a chair at the beach you can walk down and rent a pair with umbrella for about $50. The beach is very crowded, and we only went to the beach we could walk to one day.For breakfast we ate at the hotel since we had a package that included breakfast. It was always very good all around - service, quality, etc. There is no Marriot executive lounge, but on the 16th floor there is a nice coffee machine and some fruit and pastries. The kinds of executive lounge service seems to vary somewhat among the Marriot properties. This could be improved, but for us on this trip it was not a big deal since we ate every day in the restaurant. One thing to note is that there is no self parking at the hotel. Space / real estate around the hotel is really tight. The valet service is good, but one thing we learned is that it was easier to grab your car on the street when the valet was bringing it around instead of letting them pull up right to the valet stand. If you don't do this you have to exit through the alley to one side of the hotel. When we were there it was a bit tight as some construction was going on. At times the valet gets really busy, so if it is one of those times you might have to wait a bit for your car.The internet service always worked quite well everywhere in the hotel, including the fitness room.All in all this hotel exceeded my expectations.","San Diego, California","scottwJ1544VN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",2,5.0

Real estate is expensive here, so that probably accounts for the small rooms. We stayed in the executive level on the top floor, in one of the 4 largest rooms they have, and it was average. It was a standard smallish hotel room with an extra 5 feet width added on, in which they put a small table and seating area. I kept bumping my head on the light over the table getting in and out of the chairs, and I'm short. The bathroom was 5 ft by 5 ft, plus a shower. The room size was adequate for us, but I expected more. We could see a sliver of the ocean between the buildings. The room looked new, however, and was very clean.Breakfast was a small counter opposite the elevator, with a coffee machine, filtered water, orange juice, apples and oranges, and about 15 donuts. During the day, the donuts became a puffed type snack. The creamer on the coffee machine was not working during the 4 days of our stay, even though I let them know. The small front desk does not have change, and we were referred to the bar area, but after waiting a few minutes for the bar tender, I just left - not worth the hassle.I noticed that many of the five star reviews are written by first timers, so I question whether they are real reviews.The hotel is average, maybe ok for the Waikiki area.

First and foremost, the staff in the bar and restaurant were great! Staff involved around the front desk and rooms were ok at best. Being hoteliers ourselves for over 15 years we know what it takes to provide great service and they're just not there (yet). First night we arrived late, air conditioner made a incredibly loud bang every time it came on and off. Hardly slept that first night. Reported it to the desk they told us they'd look into it. It took me two follow up request u till later that next day they informed us they'll move us. They told us to pack up our stuff and they'll move it once the room was ready. We went out for about three ours and came back. Got the new room keys but no luggage. ""They forgot"". I had to go to the desk 2 more times until 40 min later our bags were finally delivered... disappointing! When I spoke to the Front office mgr about the first night she told me that she'll take the destination fee off which equates to about 100$ for our stay. The right thing would've been to take the first night off completely! I'm a Marriott platinum elite member so usually get breakfast at Marriott hotels. This hotel also states they have a continental breakfast but it's really just a doughnut and a coffee machine. Don't expect much here. Valet is also a cluster. I called down 30 minutes before our car pick up but when we got down there they didn't even get the vehicle yet! At one point there was a long line up at the front desk so I asked the concierge if he could call up my vehicle and the response was "" You want me to call up your car?"" Just not a real service attitude. That being said, Daniel at breakfast was great and Jeffrey at the bar was also awesome. We're moving in the morning to the Royal Hawaiian and hope for better hotel service. The rooms are great and new and hopefully as this hotel matures the service gets better but we leave as unsatisfied guests.

You should really think about what is important to you before you stay here.Here is my perspective based on our stay. Note, we are platinum elite members.Club Level - if you are booking this for the ""executive"" level or are an elite expecting normal Marriott benefits, do not book here if this is really important. It's a joke quite seriously. Basically anyone can access the 15th and 16th floors to get the ""benefits"" and there are single serving coffee machines that take a couple minutes to make so the line backs up quite quickly. The food or snacks can only be described as minimal. We basically never used this even though we had access.Basic Hotel Amenities - you will not be getting basics like a coffee maker or ice machines. Yes, they do give you a welcome basket which is a nice touch, but honestly I would prefer the basics. There are also only two elevators and they are slow. Don't be in a super hurry. The rooms are not super huge, but the beds were comfy and we couldn't hear our neighbors above, below or on the sides so that is always a plus. Pool is small and crowded.Elite Member benefits - don't expect anything. In face, when we asked about any upgrades the front desk person tried to tell us we got upgraded when it was the room we had reserved already. Then they gave us a room that was right next to the elevator. Luckily Rachel helped us out when we told her we wanted another room. She agreed that we'd be hearing the elevators often. She was great by the way. I already mentioned that there is no club room. We come to Hawaii frequently and had some discussions about whether to stay at another hotel where we would get access to a real club room and upgrades. It is a choice point. While almost every Marriott that does not have a club room will have elites free breakfast, do not expect this here even though there is a hotel restaurant. I don't think they are trying to attract business travelers to be honest.Location - this saves the place. It is located next to the newly renovated International Marketplace so it is super convenient to shops and restaurants all within walking distance. You are off Kuhio which has improved with all the recent development, but some aspects of old ghetto Kuhio are still there. You are also not super close to the beach. For me when you see the beaches, it is when you start to feel the Aloha feeling. But it is only about a block away. There is also really not a good view. Yes, you can see Diamond Head between buildings and you can sort of get an ocean view between buildings. Staff - very friendly and very good. Some folks mentioned the backup that can happen in the tiny little check in area, but the wait time was never that bad.Autograph Brand - if you are choosing this because of the Autograph brand of Marriott, be warned this one is more boutique and small then some of the luxury Autographs we have stayed in previously and we have stayed in quite a few.Décor - the hotel is nicely designed and the noise between rooms was not bad. There is a hip mid-century vibe to the design. The place is pretty new but there are signs of being worn down already. I am sure these rooms take a beating.Weekend Parties - we did not realize that there are weekend DJs blasting music. The noise did not bother us, but we did give pause to some of the people it attracts. It definitely changes the vibe while that is going on and the lobby area gets packed.Okay, so after all that. We did enjoy our stay and hope as the manager has responded on many of the reviews that noted improvements are under consideration. We are willing to give this place another shot when we return in July so we will see what is ""talk"" and what is real.","Phoenix, Arizona","Phoenixroby</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",224,3.0

If you would rather have good service and rest then you might want to check out another property.The ""cons"" with this property: you get nickeled and dimed for everything, we had limited access to the hotel's amenities, and the elevators are SLOW. We only booked this property because we had a free night with our Marriott rewards and the Military/Kama'aina rate for follow-on nights was decent. However, after you tack on the hotel taxes, the ""resort"" fee, and daily parking at $35 a day you are looking at $100 a day in additional fees on top of your room rate. The room lacked staples that you normally get in any room such as in-room coffee and tea. If you are like me and appreciate a cup of coffee or tea in the morning before you shower, forget it. There is no in-room coffee maker. They offer a ""coffee bar"" in the lobby but the coffee isn't free. It had prices higher than Starbucks and believe me - Starbucks this place is not. I ordered a medium coffee only to be told that they were out of medium cups and could only do small or large. The small was tiny so I opted for the large and was still charged the large price, even though she could have made the medium size serving and just put it in a large cup. Before our stay I called the hotel to ask if they provided a shuttle to the airport. I was told that they offered a shuttle to the airport but not from the airport. Since we only needed transportation to the airport this was perfect. The day of our flight I inquired on the shuttle times only to be notified that the shuttle costs $18 a person. This is highway robbery and information that could have been offered when I inquired about it earlier. We called TheCab instead and ordered a van for a total of $35 for our entire party which was literally less than half the cost of what the hotel shuttle would have been. Lastly, the hotel's restaurant and bar/coffee bar were booked for private parties almost our entire stay. We were able to eat at the restaurant for dinner the night we checked in, but it was closed pretty much the rest of the time. We ended up having to take our business elsewhere. To make matters worse, the private parties had DJ's spinning music the entire time that was so loud, you literally couldn't even communicate with the front desk staff because you could not hear each other over the loud music. Since you have to pass right by the bar to get to the elevators or to the pool you got assaulted every time you passed by. The music was so loud Saturday night that the thumping and bumping could be heard all the way from our room on the 9th floor of the hotel well past 10pm when we were trying to get to bed. Not to mention there were drunk people lingering all over the hotel. It seemed every time we got onto the elevator there was a drunk person about to be sick. There was one particularly precarious elevator ride with a woman who could barely walk and was about to throw up at any moment - I didn't think we were going to make it but she got off on a lower floor than us without being sick in the elevator. We were trying to use the pool one evening and there was a drunk guy passed out cold in a chair by the pool holding a huge bottle of alcohol in a paper bag. We didn't see a hotel security person our entire stay so my guess is this hotel doesn't have any. I attempted to complain about the noise and limited access to amenities to the front desk but got a half-hearted ""there isn't really anything I can do about it"" attitude.Overall, the hotel itself is well designed with a modern Hawaiian feel and is really pretty. It is centrally located nearby to the new International Marketplace and a short walk to Kalakaua and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center so there is plenty to do and places to eat within walking distance. Outside of the modern upgrades to modernize the look and feel of this hotel, there is no mistaking that it is an old hotel that they upgraded. The hotel only has 2 elevators and they are SLOW. We spent a lot of time waiting on an elevator during our stay which is irritating. The hotel pool area is very small with no hot tub and given that Waikiki beach is literally 1 block south of the hotel, surprisingly the pool was packed during the day time. There was not a seat to be had during the day, but after 6pm at night it is a ghost town. The pool is open until 11pm which is the latest I have seen pools and is great for those who prefer to avoid the sun's dangerous rays. We didn't use it but the fitness center seemed to be pretty nice and rarely used since it was empty every time we went by. It even offered fruit infused ice water, fresh fruit, and towels. When we were able to use the hotel's restaurant and bar, we were not impressed. Despite it's very modern and relaxed feel, the place was a zoo on the Friday night we ate there. The service was terrible beyond words and the food and drinks were mediocre as best for outrageous prices. It took over 20 minutes for our drinks to come to the table because we were told no clean glasses were available but yet tables around us who came in after us got their drinks before us. Drinks from the bar average about $15 and are fairly small. Their cocktail list is limited and left a lot of be desired. For similar prices you can get much better drinks and a meal elsewhere. The one night we were able to use the bar we received less than stellar service. We were at the pool and walked over to get drinks. When they learned we were at the pool we were immediately treated like second-class citizens. We were made to wait for a certain bartender, who when she finally came and took our order, ended up refilling and taking new drink orders for all her customers at the bar before she started to make our drinks. Then after they were made she discovered she didn't put them into the right glasses, so I had to wait even longer for her to remake the drinks in the pool glasses. All in all, I waited almost 20 minutes just for two drinks and they were not even mixed well.The best parts of our stay were the rooms themselves. The decor is really quite nice and included Hawaiiana books and even a real ukulele that was able to be taken off the shelf to be played. We were surprised by the gift basket of goodies that as it turns out is complementary. There is a note inside that states that the basket is the one of many surprises we would find during our stay. I can't say that we found any other pleasant surprises during our stay, but the basket was nice and included 2 pairs of flip-flops, short bread cookies, local kine potato chips, candy and postcards. Our room had two King beds, which are certainly King size width but not length. My husband is 6'4"" and his feet dangled off the edge when he laid on the bed which they do not on a regular queen size bed at home. The bathroom was really nice including a rather luxurious shower enclosure. We had a late flight out and were allowed to extend our check out time by one hour and they stored luggage for us several hours until our cab came to pick us up. We had a vehicle parked with the valet for several nights before bringing it to the port to ship. My husband discovered when he picked up his vehicle in the morning to take it to ship, that the valet broke the OBD-2 Connector and his onboard computer would not operate. Since it was very early when he picked up and he didn't have time to stop and argue due to needing to get to the port ASAP he wasn't able to address it with the valet staff. We figured the hotel would not take responsibility so we didn't even bother to mention it upon check out but certainly very disappointing and we will inoccur a cost to repair.All in all, we were very disappointed with this property and will not ever stay at this property again on future visits to the island.","Kaysville, Utah","parkerflyHI</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaysville, Utah</strong>",34,2.0

So loud that we had a difficult time speaking to the front desk attendant (who also commented that the music made her job challenging). The tiny lobby could not accommodate the crowd of people.While the room is cute with decorative items, it is not really functional and is very tiny. There are no hooks to hang towels anywhere, not in the bathroom, etc. The wallpaper is iconic and ""cool"", and the welcome basket with lay low slippers, etc is are nice touches.The small pool does not accommodate the crowd as well - kids splashing, families trying to cram into 1 of 2 pavilions, among couples looking for a luxury retreat.

Very nice staff but they lack the standard attention to service.The lack of care toward Marriott Elite members make this hotel a big looser in my book. They had the opportunity to stand out as a full-service Marriott in Hawaii that offers Gold and Platinum members some easy perks like a lounge and Breakfast. Yet it Is clear the cheap and bare bone options is what the management went for. They worked very hard to provide nothing with saying they provide everything. There is NO LOUNGE at this hotel do not be fooled like I did. I booked an executive room as it was the lowest class room open when I booked. I’m a Marriott gold, and normal perks are Upgrades, Lounge access and for hotels without a lounge full breakfast. This hotel is a scam! They say.. Oh yeah we have a lounge with “Drinks and Snacks” thru out the day and “continental breakfast”. Yet what I found was a table in the hallway with TAP water, a coffee machine, and 2 bins of mostly empty trail mix. Breakfast is the slap in the face that will wake you up. They have low end watered down OJ and donuts and some basic full fruit... I have seen more items at hotels at the front desk for all guest. The worst part is here is what is in the room description that I booked and paid for (Deluxe Room, Executive Level, Partial Ocean View and Mountain View, balcony) “Complimentary food: - Continental breakfast - midday snack Complimentary non-alcoholic beverages” again let me be clear as what this is in reality. Tap water, Trail mix, watered down OJ, coffee, donuts, fruit” In the hallway area they have a pull-out drink coolers that never had anything in it. I checked both the 15th and 16th floor. When asking the staff about this so called lounge, I was told “well sir, it is nice for free”. NOT FREE I booked a room that cost more with these so called perks. As for other perks as a gold.. NO upgrade or even a apology they could not upgrade me, NO Elite recognition, Nothing! At the bar as I was I talking to a Platinum guest who did get a $10 food voucher. Wow just shows this hotel is not trying to “deal” with Marriott Elite members. Fail! Now to the room. It is nice, modern but on the small side. Before they redid this place, it was a roach hotel. Not anymore. I would pick this place based on the room, but lack of so much makes the nice rooms last on my list. This hotel thinks they can survive based off being new and having nice rooms. Just not going to cut it in the sea of hotels in Waikiki. Room was clean, Bed was nice. Bathroom was small but nice, shower water pressure was not great. The wifi was SLOW and at times just did not work. The room style was cool and a good place to crash. Yet they lack of normal Marriott perks even for an Autograph collection hotel. One last thing there was a welcome basket in the room. A nice touch (I’m told this is for the so called Executive rooms) it was 2 sets of branded flip flops, 2 bottles of local soda, and some chips and cookies. But the thing I found a bit odd was two condoms at the bottom of the basket, I may be old school but this is odd for a High end Marriott branded hotel. I can not imagine how this could be awkward for parents who have kids running for the chips and find this.. Yes this hotel is new and my issues can not be put down as growing pains. It is a clearly calculated way to provide Marriott Elites the bare minimal with playing around the rules on what a hotel should provide.","Oahu, Hawaii","dcl80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oahu, Hawaii</strong>",357,2.0

The website showed off the property and amenities and completely sold me on the experience. The reviews were also favorable. Unfortunately, the experience has fallen short... very short! I decided to upgrade to the ""Executive level, Executive Suite, King, Sofa bed, Manoa Mountain view, Partial ocean view"" with promises access to a Club Level experience. The website says: ""Special Benefits"" including:Complimentary food:- Continental breakfast- midday snack- Complimentary non-alcoholic beveragesThe complimentary food is a completely false representation. Continental breakfast this morning from 7-9am was ""Lilikoi cronuts"" and nothing more. At 715am there was no more orange juice, only water and coffee. Complimentary non-alcoholic beverages is literally water and coffee. There are two refrigerated drawers that have not been filled with any bottled water or beverages since we arrived. We've made it a point to check frequently throughout the day.On a positive note, the rooms are lovely! Spacious, well designed, beautiful decor. We did enjoy our welcome basket. That was the big plus of our stay but still not enough to make up for an ""Executive Level"" with disappointing 24/7 snacks and drinks. The other weird thing is that there is no ice available anywhere on the floor. We went in search of ice all over the floor then had to call down to the front desk. They are always happy to deliver things to us but that would've been nice to know upon check-in.Last rant- when we drove in, there was no one at the valet stand and no signage to indicate it was a valet stand. So we drove around the hotel 2x until we finally found our valet gentleman to help us.

I ended up choosing Laylow even though they were pricier because Pacific Beach was still under construction and I didn't want to hear construction noise. Laylow is a small hotel. They only have two people checking guest in. The check in process went smooth, but I noticed the person checking in next to me got a lot more information about the hotel. In terms of activities happening and where everything was. I just got my key cards handed to me. The rooms were nice. I liked that there were two king beds, but there is no other space for a table. So if you are here for business there is no table to do your work. When we got to our room I could hear construction going on for the building next to the hotel. Remember I chose this hotel because it was done remodeling with no construction. I called down to the front desk to ask if this would be going on all day and early morning. They assured me that it would not. So I decided to deal with it since we would be out. But early morning around 4am I could hear trucks back up all morning and then by 6;30am the construction started. I called the front desk later in the morning when I was about to head out about the noise. They said they could switch my room and to gather all my luggage in one spot for the bell hopper. I headed out for the day and by the time I got back that evening I got keys to my new room.They switched my room to the other side of the hotel away from the construction with a view of the pool on the 7th floor. Well on the weekends they have a DJ for the Hideout bar area near the front desk blasting music. I called down to the front desk Kim answered, I asked how long this music would go on til. She said midnight. With no apologies or anything. So I'm thinking fine I'll put on my ear plugs, but nope I could hear the music THROUGH my EAR PLUGS! That tells you how loud the music was. I had a early morning of activities. I called back down a couple of times and no on answered. I finally made one more call and the manager answered the phone. Kim must of known it was me and either didn't pick up or waited for the manager to pick up. If you call down at night its always the same person that picks up. That's how small they are. So the manager apologizes and says they'll have them turn the music down. That doesn't help at all. I call again and told her it didn't help and I could hear the music through my ear plugs. I also tell her I don't want to pack up and change rooms again as I'm only there for 4 nights. I didn't want to unpack and repack again. She said if the noise was still unbearable then to call back, but I didn't see what calling back would do as I really didn't want to change rooms again. That's not what I went on vacation to do. On top of all that in the new room there was a wad of dirty hair stuck on the wall of the shower. Which was gross!! I didn't get much sleep at all during my stay, as the first night there was the early construction in the first room, 2nd through 4th night I heard the blasting music every night! Which made it very tiring for the activities I had each day. This was not a relaxing vacation at all. Also they have no ice machines, or coffee machines in the rooms. So every time you want ice you have to call to get it. Nor was there paper and note pad in the rooms like majority of the hotels you stay at. So you have to call for every thing which means you have to tip for every thing there. Which isn't a problem, but for ice?Overall, I was very disappointed with my stay. Had I known all this I would not have booked with this hotel. I was unable to get any rest and paid more to stay here.","Seattle, Washington","Helen N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",2,2.0

To the LayLow Team and anyone who may happen upon this review, I hope this finds you helpful. The LayLow Waikiki is my absolute new/new fave hotel in Waikiki. I was born and raised in Hawaii, on Oahu. As a local, staying in Waikiki can sometimes be such a hassle. It's hard because you want to have a vacation but can't afford to ""travel"" so for myself and many other locals, stay-cationing in Waikiki is the second best thing. The struggle presents itself when you want to enjoy your island home but among a sea of tourists. Many times hotels, public spaces can be so congested it's hard to enjoy. The LayLow presents a stunning solution to this dilemma. On to my personal review of staying at the LayLow, My friends and I made a weekend of staying at the LayLow because we had a special event to attend together. I had heard rave reviews of the hotel from my close friends and wanted to stay as well. Upon checking in and being helped by a staff who was nothing but absolutely lovely, I instantly fell in love with the hotel, and I hadn't even got to my room yet! The whole design aesthetic of the hotel is what charmed me straight off. A vintage 60's, old Waikiki Glam while still being very modern and accommodating in comparison to its competitors. Loved everything about the rooms. One of my best friends and I had shared a room, and the two king beds were absolute heaven to sleep on, the BEAUTIFUL WALLPAPER, the awesome gift basket you receive, luscious air conditioning, and a lovely bathroom. The wood tiling in the shower is stunning. Being a musician, particularly enjoyed that there is an actual good quality soprano ukulele in each room that guests can play with and get lessons. Another good friend of mine had a suite and SWEET LORD, the room is AMAZING. We wish we could live there. I did not want to leave. THE HIDEOUT is also another thing that amazed me about the LayLow. In Waikiki there are so many restaurants that tend to be too pricey, too fancy, and rely on gimmicks to sell food. The food here feels like old fashioned local comfort food with still feeling gourmet and elevated in taste and presentation. The bar, deck, and fire pit area which we were lucky enough to relax in is just another visually stunning part of the hotel. I do wish the pool was a bit bigger and deeper but it's still also very beautiful and the lounge chairs and beds by the pool are soooooo comfortable. Side note, we were lucky and was at the pool when the hotel gave FREE shave ice, it was no joke, THE BEST SHAVE ICE I've ever had. I hope I've included everything that I set out to talk about, bottom line I just want to build up and compliment the excellence of this hotel. Lastly the Valet staff is also very good! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND staying here, what I loved most was that, the location of the LayLow being where it is on Kuhio, and the layout of the hotel, you know you're in Waikiki but you can actually relax and be secluded from the crowds bustling just down the escalators. And if you do want to explore Waikiki, you're located in kind of a center of both Kuhio and Kalakaua Ave which makes getting around easy. Mahalo to the LayLow Ohana, I can't wait to come back with my friends and family. ",,Lina R,2,4.0

The hotel is new and the design is awesome. You definitely feel like you are in Hawaii and not a typical Marriott, other than the good service. My room was large and nicely furnished. It included several interesting books as well as free amenities and snacks. The pool area is nice but relatively small. This is not a place to stay if you have young kids who like splashing around in a large pool. The hotel is more suited for couples and business travelers who want to know they are not on the mainland anymore. There is a great, and very popular, udon restaurant right across the street. The only downside of my stay was that the front desk neglected to text me when my room was ready. I will definitely stay here on my next trip.

Downside is you're not on the beach, which we knew coming into this. The benefits for platinum members are just do not in any way live up to the standards of any other property we have stayed at. Terribly disappointing, really. The breakfast promised to platinum members is a complete joke.... pastries and beverages=not adequate. Worse, the ""lounge"" is literally a table in the hallway on a floor that all guests have access to. I explained my disappoint to the manager, and asked if there was anything she could do at all to help out with breakfasts since we'd have to be buying them, and was told that I got my $10 voucher (or 500 points) and there was nothing she could do.

The rooms are also equipped with USB docs, comfy robes, and a gift basket with all the things you need to experience the Hawai'i lifestyle.

FOOD: Hideout Restaurant/Bar has a nice ambient feel being an open air, and it's especially beautiful at night when the fire pits are lit. Food is amazing. STAFF: Everyone is so friendly and willing to help, especially the concierge and valet. They really make you feel at home and excellently assist in all your needs. Cool personal testimony- I was waiting for my car to pull up at around noon, and being that is was pretty hot, one of the valet attendants offer and say ""it's pretty hot, you're welcomed to come stand over here if you'd like"" pointing to where their desk is, supported by a big umbrella to keep the workers cool.

I booked this hotel as part of a Marriott vacation package. Overall, our experience was very good.On a scale of 1-5, I would give the hotel staff a 6. From the front desk staff to the concierges to the restaurant waiters to the hotel maids, they were all friendly, helpful, professional, very customer service-oriented. The hotel was recently renovated and beautifully decorated. The location was perfect, as was the size of the hotel.Two categories of things prevent a 5-star rating. First, the Marriot vacation package said we would have a ""view."" The balcony of our room looked straight into a parking garage. That doesn't fit my definition of a ""view."" Second, there were technical/technological problems that may relate to the recent renovation; they need to be resolved. We could not get HBO on our television and we had problems getting our cellphones to work in the room--these all seemed to relate to problems with the wifi service the hotel had gotten from an outside vendor. The other technical issues related to the elevators. The key card for the room also was to be used in the elevator to gain access to our floor. Frequently it did not work. On our last morning there, both elevators stopped working altogether. Fortunately, they were back in service by the time we had to take our suitcases down and check out.Besides the good experience at the hotel, we went on numerous tours that were great. The Circle tour of Oahu was not great due to the overbearing guide. Probably the most fun and interesting tour we took was a walking tour one evening with a company called Mysteries of Hawaii owned by Lopaka Kapanui. The most calming dining experience we had was a formal afternoon tea on the veranda overlooking the ocean at a wonderful hotel called the Moana Surfrider.All in all, a lovely vacation.",San Francisco,"Jenni P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco</strong>",1,4.0

Friendly valet guys.... welcoming front desk... cheerful housekeeping staff.... and the managers always seemed to be walking around the hotel and restaurant asking if we were enjoying ourselves and if we needed anything. Rooms were clean... comfy beds.... I got the suite to get the full experience.... and because I saw that they were pet-friendly, I brought my dog with me... they had a doggie bed and bowls waiting for us when we got in the room. My dog didn't even want to sleep by me because she loved how comfy her bed was. And when we'd walk in and out of the hotel, the staff would address my dog too. She had a BLAST!Also... that welcome gift basket in the room with the slippers, and snacks?! You better believe I ate and drank everything in there! And I wore my slippers with pride! Fun!Don't get me started with the Hideout restaurant! Because I was there from Friday through Tuesday, I was able to experience their DJs on Friday and Saturday AND the live music (they have live music Sunday-Thursday). It was a great way to wind down when I'd get back to the hotel.The food at the restaurant was tasty and fresh.... best burgers and poke tacos you'll ever eat!

I'm going to bullet point this review to try and keep it concise:-Staff: Everyone on staff that I encountered was incredibly friendly, I mean everyone; Valet, front desk, housekeeping, servers and managers at the Hideout restaurant, everyone. The front desk was especially helpful in helping track down a suit that I had misplaced on my last day.-The room: Fresh, cheerful, and very comfortable. I booked a junior suite with a king bed, and the decor was fun, very trendy & retro. There was a cute gift basket with local treats and two pairs of slippers (flip flops) on the surfboard shaped coffee table. I was delighted to see a small collection of popular books on Hawaiian culture & history and there was also a tenor ukulele that I enjoyed playing in my room. There was also a cute little office nook tucked away behind the TV. I was happy to find USB docs on both sides of the very comfortable bed for device charging.-Pool: The pool is a wading/hangout style pool (only gets 3 feet deep) with nifty little one piece lounge chair-things that are submerged about 6 inches on one side of the pool which I found fun for pretending to be in a luxury vacation photo shoot. There are also two cabanas opposite the pool entrance, a bunch of two-person day beds and free shaved-ice near the pool in the lobby (not sure if this was a Sunday thing or an everyday thing?)-Hideout restaurant: Very cool semi-covered roof-top restaurant & bar, two firepits,and great pacific fusion food. Organic beef burgers and creative poke bowls were a favorite.-Location: The hotel isn't on the ""main"" Waikiki road which was great because you don't get the same pedestrian and vehicle traffic congestion. The new International marketplace is right next door and there are lots of neat little local restaurants in close walking distance.To summarize, I had an exceptional stay and am definitely planning on returning for another staycation as soon as I can. I very highly recommend the Lawlow!",,Eston R,1,5.0

Service is exceptionally good, staff members going out of their way to please. Beds are still firm/comfortable, but this is a new property. Pool and exercise room are small but it works.HOWEVER, as a Marriott elite member, this property is a disappointment when it comes to elite benefits. As noted earlier, there is no serious breakfast benefit that Marriott Gold/Platinum members would normally get. Instead, what they have ""negotiated"" (per the front desk) is a Keurig coffee machine and one pastry type that varies by the day. There isn't an executive lounge, despite the hotel selling ""Executive Level"" rooms! What a joke. There is a nice restaurant on site and one would typically expect a daily breakfast voucher in lieu of the lounge breakfast.. well, guess what - no breakfast coupon either. Forget about complimentary room upgrades for elite members - not offered. Might have to beg the front desk for this one. If you are here on business, the rooms have a tiny desk in each room. It's not really a desk where you can work on. The hotel lists a business kiosk in the lobby, according to their materials.. surprise -- none exists. Per the front desk, there is a tablet available for use (I cannot imagine how this helps anyone). Best of all (insert sarcasm here), there is a Destination Amenity fee of $25 per day.Notice how it's not called a Resort Fee, probably because it's not a resort (not on the beach!). What amenities does one receive due to the fee? Hmm.. I wonder. In conclusion, this property is great if you got lucky with your Priceline bid or if you want nice sized hotel rooms in a great location (International Marketplace is next door!). Marriott elites, biz travelers - look elsewhere to get your money's worth.","Chicago, Illinois","izzik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",80,3.0

Pulling up, I was greeted by a friendly valet attendant whom I told I was checking in but planned to leave once I dropped my bags. He said he would keep the car ready. I was directed to an escalator (there's an elevator too) with directions to the front desk. Walking up to the front desk I was greeted by name (nice touch by the valet) and promptly checked-in. As a platinum Rewards Member, I was given a nice little upgrade to a junior suite. This was much appreciated even if traveling solo and was also told there would be a welcome basket with some complimentary items (they might do this for everyone). The room was a nice size with a sitting area and probably the size of two normal rooms. It was on a lower floor so my view was of a parking garage, but it wasn't a big deal given my short stay and the free upgrade. Overall, everyone on the staff was very friendly and accommodating. Highlights of the property are: it very much has a boutique feel and not the same vibe as some of the other touristy waikiki hotels | decor is fresh and new | proximity to the International Plaza and great dining options within walking distance | pool and bar area.Only two detractors although both are minor: elevators were on the fritz while there so stairs were needed to be used | not on the beach and probably most views are city (or garage if low).All in all, I would recommend and stay here again if in Waikiki.

We usually stay at the Marriott or Waikiki Parc but were excited to give this new hotel a try. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. The hotel is brand new- who doesn't love a fresh, new, stylish hotel? Our room on the 16th floor was great- except the day it wasn't cleaned. We had the do not disturb sign out until 10am, returned at 2pm and called to request a cleaning when we departed again at 3pm. Never happened. I find that inexcusable at what touts itself as a high end hotel. Speaking of high end- I've seen the manager's response to reviews about the continental breakfast. The pastries are not great- chocolate donuts or cheese danishes shoved in a glass box aren't high end. Why not provide the executive floor with the same high quality pastries available at the coffee bar downstairs? The continental breakfast provided definitely has a Holiday Inn Express feel. And as others have noted the hallway fills with guests from other floors so it can be pretty loud in the morning. I felt bad for the guests in the room beside it.Other than that we did enjoy this place and will likely stay again.","Seattle, Washington","Vagabondgirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",57,4.0

All around pretty design and styling. The bed was very comfortable. Front desk, valets, wait staff were all very nice. The soap and toiletries smelled so good, but I couldn't find them in their little shop. The shop has a nice little collection of Aloha Beach Club wear and the handmade mugs from an LA artist, but the rest was kind of boring. Cocktails at the bar were very tasty. Chips and guac good, too. Cons: This hotel seems confused of its identity. No coffee or minibar in room, but room service stops at 11p. We checked in at almost 11p and had to call down to let them know our slippers and welcome basket were not in the room. Just kind of a pain when we were exhausted. The executive level lounge is really just a long bar in the hallway in front of the elevators. In the morning there's donuts, the afternoon rice puff snacks and cookies at night. They were similar to what you get at a large grocery store bakery. Fine. But most frustrating is the terrible coffee machine, it's the kind you'd find at a gas station. Really bad. And no cream just a bowl of artificial liquid creamer packs. Seriously? Felt like I was at a roadside motel. Why not have good Kona coffee? Even the restaurant coffee was bad and inconsistent. Was able to get a decent drip coffee from the little coffee shop in the lobby. Everyone in the entire hotel seems to use the executive floor to get coffee and pastries. Business people will ride the elevator up and give you dirty looks for being in a robe on vacation. And stuff runs out at 7am. Such a bad setup. We had breakfast included in our package and the food was just okay. We tried both benedicts and found them so bland and the hollandaise tasted like they forgot the lemon. Never mind that the tiny crab cake patty tasted frozen. The next day we tried the rice skillet and sandwich, both of which were strangely very sweet and again bland. I think they poured sweet syrup all over the rice. Also the skillet pan was cold, like they heated the rice in a microwave and then dumped it in a skillet for presentation. And again the coffee is so bad. The winner finally was the salmon toast. And this morning the entire kitchen/ bar/ coffee shop staff was running around confused and we got to hear a loud argument in the kitchen among the cooks and waitstaff. What a mess. If you're not interested in good coffee, if a minibar and consistent food/ room service aren't important to you and you just want a place to lay your head at night this would be a good hotel for you. I wish I would have stayed at the Surfjack or even paid a little more to stay at the Modern or the Moana. I was looking for more of a place I could eat, drink and hang out at and the Laylow did not fit the bill for that kind of trip. This hotel has so much potential, the design is on point so you think they are going to be boutiquey, but sadly things are just executed poorly. At check out the front desk lady with the metal on her face was not friendly and never offered to call down to valet or even ask us how our stay was. In fact that is the general vibe of things here, the only staff who asked how our stay was going was the valet guys. They were great. The rest of the staff seemed very inexperienced and lacking direction. Despite the insta worthy decor it feels more like a corporate airport hotel. Very confusing and disappointing.

I had booked my reservation before it opened, so I had no idea what to expect. Well the hotel ended up being even more beautiful than I expected! There was so much attention to detail, and the tropical midcentury vibe was stunning. The first night we stayed in a standard room which had partial ocean and island view, which was already great. The last 3 days, they moved us to a larger suite due to some technical difficulties. The suite had a separate dining/work space, which would be perfect for those trying to get some work done while on vacation. We loved hanging out downstairs in their lobby area, and the pool was very nicely done with several lounge chairs and two large covered sunbeds. We had happy hour at The Hideout, and got coffee there in the morning (Stumptown was a big bonus!). At night, we would hang out at the Hideout for drinks as well. The live artists and the DJs played amazing music. All the staff were really nice, especially the evening valet guys! The location was very central. We walked to several restaurants and shops. The International Market next door just opened, and it seems like a lot of new restaurants are popping up in that center.

This is a nice refurbished hotel in a good part of town that has many nice features. If you are an Elite Marriott member who has stayed at the Waikiki Beach Resort, you will find the free breakfast to be an embarrassment. The concierge lounge/free breakfast is a table in the hallway of the 15 and 16 floors that features a coffee machine and a box of doughnuts.My first morning there I complained to the manager and was told that this what you get. Several nights later while sitting by the firepit having a cocktail and listening to the live music, I told my story to my waitress Ivy who took ownership of it and soon I was visited by Chris who is another of the managers. I suggested to Chris that he visit the breakfast at the other Marriott and see what is being provided there as opposed to what was being served at the Laylow.Chris made it right by providing me with daily credit to be used in the restaurant for breakfast.

The staff let you borrow towels to take to the beach or if you stay by the pool, you get a delicious shaved ice delivered right to where you are sitting! Valet parking is super expensive at $35 a night but .. the valet staff are wonderful! Great hotel -great location- nice rooms! My only advice is that the furniture -beds- chairs on lanai are all low profile which matches the retro 60s vibe of the hotel so if you have mobility issues then maybe see if they have accessible rooms available. Definitely going back to the Laylow!","Kelowna, Canada","bmilnes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kelowna, Canada</strong>",9,5.0

I went with my parents for my dad's birthday trip. We stayed on the 11th floor, in a room with two very spacious king-sized beds. There was a small balcony that overlooked an outdoor pool of the hotel next door.Every morning we had breakfast downstairs at 'The Hideout' with fantastic service from all of the staff. Special shout out to Kehau (or the pretty lady as my mom referred to her) for being so friendly and providing excellent service!If you are using valet, there was quite a bit of construction going on beside the hotel resulting in a bit of a hassle getting out of the alley. The location of the hotel is fantastic and the pool which is on the same level as the check-in desk and the restaurant, is small but is like an urban oasis. Also, the International Market Place is literally right next door and the famous Marukame Udon where you will see long line-ups is right across the street from the hotel. The best thing about this hotel is that everything is brand spanking new (including the towels, furniture, bed sheets etc) and the decor is so unique and retro chic. Although it was a bit of a gamble when I initially booked the hotel as there were no reviews given its newness, I am very happy with the choice and my parents really enjoyed it too.

We originally checked into the Waikiki Marriott Resort and Spa and were so disappointed in the room. I received an email about this hotel opening, but with lack of photos on their website - I just didn't feel confident switching our reservation to this new hotel. Literally minutes after checking in to the Waikiki Marriott Resort and Spa, I picked up the phone and called The Laylow to see if they could accommodate us for a week. Luckily for us, they were able to! Upon our check-in at The Laylow, we were greeted with fresh pineapple slices. There was live music being played in the Hideout lobby bar. The room was spacious with two KING sized beds (Waikiki Marriott has doubles, yuck). The room also had plenty of drawer space, which was highly needed with three women sharing a room! There was a fabulous welcome basket filled with snacks, drinks, and postcards waiting for us in the room - compliments of the hotel manager. The pool area is quaint with a jungle type of feel. They have complimentary water and sunscreen available, as well as super cute towels. Not to mention, they give out complimentary shaved ice mid afternoon. The executive floors were stocked with snacks, water, and coffee. I've stayed at other Marriott hotels that have had much more to offer in this department. The Laylow's set up was pretty basic, but the daily donuts were very legit and tasty!This hotel is retro, but also very modern. This is the perfect hotel for instagrammers! You will have loads of content to take pictures of with all the fun details scattered about the hotel. The location of this hotel is also spot on. It is centrally located and is within walking distance of everything!If I ever get back to Waikiki, I will definitely stay at this hotel again.

We were worried because a bad hotel experience will ruin your once a year holidays.There werent a lot of reviews for Laylow when we book, after all the day we check in were only the 3rd week since their grand opening. I will highly recommend and will definitely return to Laylow next time.Let's start with service, everyone is friendly, helpful and smile all the time. I like to comment Mr Chris Horning, for being super attentive and always try to make sure we are well taken care of. Kudus to you sir!We book the standard room with BreakfastRoom, Modern decoration. The room have a three sitter couch which can easily be transform into an extra bed. We have a 2 year old who sleep with us at our bed. The sofa works great for us. Internet, we dont have any issue with the internet. I was playing online game one night and dont have connection or lagging issueLocation, about 2 blocks away from Waikiki Beach. A enjoyable walk. They are plenty of restaurants around too. We got bored of them pretty quick though. The Honolulu Trolley pink line bus station is right across the road. Very convenient. Nordstrom Rack is just around the corner. We spend 4 nights there, just hunting for treasures. Lastly the breakfast. I have to say the breakfast will be the reason we will go back to Laylow. We book the place with breakfast included. I think they under sell their breakfast online. Their breakfast is absolutely amazing. For breakfast, you will get a $50 limit to spend on anything on the breakfast menu. Tips is excluded, so you will have to pay around $10-15 tips. Obviously this is objective. $50 is enough for family of 3. You must try their North Shore Egg Benedict. It is top of the class!Area of improvement:Air conditioning, though its does it job, it could be quite loud when it cranking up. I am pretty sure I can hear the thermostat click. We open our balcony door most nights, but it could still be quite noisy because of the location. We stay at 14th floor.Netflix, it is available at the smart TV but you need to log in with your own account, not a major since I have an account. Though, it a lot better then most other hotel which dont give you an option to Netflix. Bath, there is no bath in the room. The shower were great though, strong pressure, good hot/cold water mix.I would recommend this to all my friends.Good luck with your stay!Sooi","Ipoh, Malaysia","Sooi W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ipoh, Malaysia</strong>",1,5.0

Next door, for example, is the new International Marketplace. A five-minute walk away is Duke's - and the beach. The hotel itself is kind of Hawaiian-retro. Great for couples - I didn't see many kids. Speaking of kids, the pool is smallish - which is probably not conducive to kids. The fact that it's a Marriott makes it even better.

Other than that, the location is excellent, right in the best part of Waikiki. Walking distance from everything you might want to do in Waikiki. The price is also right. It was less than half the price of the ocean front hotels. None of the hidden fees (such as resort fees and other nonsense that should really be illegal). But this isn't just about the price being lower. The hotel is plain cool. Every guest gets a gift basket. Free shave ice in the afternoon. A cool bar with live music. All beds are really nice king-size beds. Modern AV in the room, allowing streaming apps (such as connecting to your Netflix account). Cool, modern room decoration (to a point where I took home some ideas for our own home). Books and a ukulele in every room add a nice Hawaiian touch. And so on. I really enjoyed my stay.

Part of this redevelopment has been the reopening of the International Market Place with Saks Fifth Avenue, the first tower of the Ritz Carlton open and the second under construction, the first Starbuck Reserve open and only one of 15 in the world and now the Laylow an autograph collection hotel owned by the Marriott.And what a welcome arrival it is, a fun and quirky hotel tha'ts only a week old, that is paying homage to its retro Hawaiian roots but with all the flare of a completely fresh and innovative refurbishment.On the first level is the check in, breakfast area and pool. The Modern has held the mantle of the best new hotel in Hawaii for a while but I think its time to hand it to the Laylow. Rooms on the top two floors are spacious with partial ocean views over the top of the Pink Palace. Decor is Hawaiian but with a great fresh citrus twist that leaves a real zing.The problem with a lot of Hawaiian Hotels - yes you Hyatts, Marriotts, Sheratons and Outriggers is they have the location i.e. beachside but they let their rooms deteriorate into these old and dated dinosaurs. If you are a savvy traveller you will start looking for hotels like the Laylow that offer friendly happy staff that set the atmosphere for your visit. Innovative ideas like snack bars with complimentary snacks, tea/coffee and continental breakfast. Rooms that are styled with a homage to Hawaii that is chic and contemporary. Pool areas that are more Las Vegas than Children's urinal. And a breakfast area that resembles a great urban cafe.While its early days this hotel really deserves to succeed and if the staff are all as welcoming as Rachel and James when we visited then we will be back.
