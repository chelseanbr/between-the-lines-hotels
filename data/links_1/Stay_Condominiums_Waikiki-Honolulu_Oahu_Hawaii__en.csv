Then they said they had been trying to get the maintenance to fix it, but because it was the holidays, they would not come out... So it must have been broken for several weeks....",,81bryanc,0,3.0

That means Wi-Fi is not free. You check in at the hotel across the street. Are they touring the hotel my girlfriend and I were shocked. It is not as advertised. The floor is so dirty that my Japanese girlfriend did not want to take your shoes off in the condominium. All the cabinets were old and dirty. Some of the Cabinets and Doors have been eaten Away by termites at the base. This is not the clean bright rooms they advertise. About three or four inches away from the wall all the way around the condo the floor is never been cleaned disgusting dirt everywhere. And cockroaches everywhere everywhere cockroaches. Cockroaches on your food plates cockroaches in your luggage cockroaches waving to you while you're eating your breakfast. It's good we did not spend much time in the condo. Because my girlfriend's been most of her time screaming and tried to shoot the Cockroaches out the broken sliding glass door. The screen door for the sliding glass door was just laying there against the wall. I guess no one goes out there to check anything. The location of this place is ideal. That's why we chose it. I parked in the parking structure near the condo and paid for 5 days with the parking. They towed my car anyway and charge me almost $300 to get it back. I used to live in Hawaii. And I used to go to Waikiki a lot before I move there. It was never like this. My advice used to stay away from Waikiki all together. It has changed into a tourist trap of epic proportion. I came here to visit my friends who all live on different parts of Oahu. They all said he's really changed in the last few years. Oh and did I mention the homeless people everywhere. All over Waikiki Beach. Homeless people drunk people everywhere. People screaming and fighting all night when you're trying to sleep.

This is a single room that has a king bed, a futon/couch, and a small kitchen. There is NO OTHER FURNITURE. No table, no chairs, no desk, nothing! There is no divider between the bed and the rest of the unit.The location is 2 blocks from the beach, but the rest of the location is terrible. There is an Alamo rental car right next door, so all the units hear the cars starting, stopping, radios blaring, horns honking, and alarms going on. Across the street is the back side of the King’s Village shopping center (which will be closing at the end of January 2019 and replaced by a new hotel). So at 4 am, yes, 4 in the morning, garbage trucks are on the narrow street revving engines, backing up with their beepers, lifting dumpsters, and making a lot of noise. At least units 1, 4, and 8 are impacted by this, but probably more. There are 3 parking space for 11 units and they are $45 per night. When you check in, they will recommend 3 other locations that are $30/night.This was supposed to be a 1 bedroom condo for 4 people. It is a single room as said earlier. For four people, it had 3 sets of towels, 3 forks, 7 spoons, and 11 knives. It did have 4 dinner plates and salad plates and 4 coffee cups, but only 2 tall glasses and 2 both of which were cracked in multiple places.It had a single cup coffee maker, but they ran out of regular coffee one day and only had decaf. It takes special packets (not k-cups) so you can’t really even buy coffee. It has a single window air conditioner which struggles to keep the place at 72 degrees even when it is only 74 at night out side, but you can’t open the door to the balcony at night because it is too loud. All the windows are louvered windows, but most don’t stay open either and if you are in a front unit will just let in even more noise than they already do. The food AC unit had to run so hard and so loud all the time, it never stopped. At least a ceiling fan would help.Pain is peeling every where and the paint job is sloppy, runs and drips. The floors were so dirty that upon arrival and walking across the room once, our feet were black. We used one of the 5 bath mats to mop and sweep the floor when we arrived. The TV is mounted on a corner wall, so you bump into it when trying to walk between the the bed and the wall. It has a small “shelf” above it that is just 2 brackets that cost $2 at Home Depot and a 12 inch by 9 inch piece of peg board not even painted and NOT screwed down. We nocked it down once accidentally and it scared the crap out of us.The stove top in our unit was bent like someone stood on it to get to the shelves above. One of the burners (electric) was broken. They have one power strip in the kitchen with the microwave, coffee maker, phone, and cable decoder all plugged into it. The same duplex outlet in the wall that had the power strip also had the air conditioner plugged in. Expedia advertises this at a 3-Star for typically $250 per night and we got it for half price on a Black Friday 2018 sale. This is not a 3-Star unit. The person who took the pictures that are on line should get an award for how good they made this sparse studio apartment look.","San Jose, California","Stubecullerstan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",1,1.0

There was nowhere to eat in the room. Note, your website showed bar seating. Vanessa offered to bring barstools to the room but it’s absurd that a patron should even have to complain about this.6) broken tv (We were told the tv had been broken for some time and you were waiting for a part from your corporate office somewhere in the Midwest, all of which is absurd.)7) no blankets on the bed or in the room upon arrival. It took 2.5 hours and a trip to the front desk to get them.8) nasty shower curtain that only covers about half of the shower and resulted in a soaked floor with every shower9) amenities charge for next to nothing in exchange. I’ve never stayed at a hotel that charges for coffee and tea in the lobby or towels. 10) outrageous parking cost, higher than almost anything nearby, and even higher than many high-end hotels in San Francisco. Additionally, there weren’t spots available adjacent to the apartment on one of the nights even though we had paid for it. 11) Requested one hour later check out at noon was met with resistance. I was told I could only make the request the day of. This is ridiculous given you don’t allow your guests to check in until 4 pm. This isn’t a condo. It is a cinderblock, studio dump. It’s very clear your owners don’t care about this property and have done little to maintain it with any integrity or quality. The best thing this place has going for it is Amy who worked the front desk the first couple of days we were here.

This is not a 3-star location as advertised, its a poorly-maintained motel with an odd kitchen. If you read the responses from the GM it shows a clear pattern of attempting to apologize and deflect without ever fixing material defects. As Danny M said on 8/22/2016 the photos are glossed up: I see that the GM - so happy to respond - still hasn't updated them to be more accurate.  The property has a kitchen but no dining table, bar stools or basically any place to eat. We took a cookie sheet and placed it on the luggage rack. But that's OK it allowed us to look at the severely scratched cafeteria flooring from my public-school childhood. This (the lack of tables) was mentioned in prior reviews too on 3/9/2016, 1/10/2017, 2/03/17. The first time the GM talked about pending upgrades, I note now they are quiet on that.But at least it's a place to sleep, wait no it isn't because the louvered windows (some cracked) block no noise and the neighboring car rental company has alarms going off at 3 AM - and, the less said about the apartments next door who power sawed, hammered and yelled until 9PM each night the better. Best you can hope to do is drowned it out with the overly loud, broken and moldy A/C unit. But hey for us it was in the kitchen (so it cooled almost only that) and not over our bed like in some photos (which is just horrible). The bathroom is equally horrible with a pocket door and a hook-and-eye closure, two mismatched shower handles, only one place to hang a towel and a broken toilet.  I feel like I could have had a better stay in the roach motel in under the sink. Look, if you’re a college student who doesn't much care about quality: this may be for you, but if your a business traveler, family or someone who wants a modicum of comfort/safety/peace: look elsewhere. After my dissatisfaction I realized Priceline did me no favors, I could have gotten a real hotel for not much more. Also, just be advised the hotel charges $45 for first-come-first-serve parking, a car as mentioned in prior reviews may be a hindrance... but, if you need transport, the public lot in the neighboring hotel only charges $30. The hotel is the Aqua Pacific Monarch and the entrance to the lot is on Kuhio Ave before Uluniu Ave. I only mention this because the desk agent was unable or unwilling to provide the location on check-in, rather I was told there are a ""few"" public lots around, The walk is worth the savings in my opinion.

You need an early breakfast? There's breakfast places just within a block. Need a quick stock of supplies before heading out to North Shore? Just down by the corner is an ABC store. If you're going to Chief's Luau by thr Sea Life Park, the shuttle (rsvp and payment needed) is across the street picking up mostly Hyatt-Regency guests. The wifi is actually not that bad, but I suggest you download a VPN app for your devices for added online security. There's personal computers down by the lobby, but use only for search, I suggest do not use it to log on to any of your accounts. There's also a karaoke bar down at the lobby. I never got to go but it seems a nice place to chill for a bit. If you need beach mats, body boards and towels, just ask at the front lobby. One thing I like was the free use of laundry. It just means I can pack less clothes and just wash and reuse what I bought.Now, the downsides when my friend and I went to stay at this hotel. Just like some guests had mentioned, the garbage truck pickups is really loud in the morning. It's not that big of a deal to me as I'm usually an early riser but my friend was not so much of a fan. We also had a toilet that makes this very high pitched sound after each flush. I had to open up the toilet back cover, isolate the issue, and found that air is coming out from the fill valve not closing completely. A simple flick up to close it well is all it takes. Minor but very annoying issue when you had to take a minor wee in the middle of the night, flush it, go back to bed. Only to get up again 2 minutes to fix the high pitch sound.","Fremont, California","naturalflavors</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fremont, California</strong>",1,4.0

The building is gated so I felt secure at night. The room is very simple, with all the necessities you need. The full kitchen was a lifesaver with the good sized refrigerator.

Kitchen with amenities for cheaper meals, and everything was clean.The city was doing some sewer work on the second day of our stay, and we had an issue with our plumbing as a result.

I have provided photos to help demonstrate this. The accommodation is literally two streets back from the beach (refer nice view photo!). But, as the other photos show, it's a little rough, which for the price should be expected as you are literally right next to an amazing beach paying bargain basement prices for the area. You can't have it both ways, and for us, we were happy to save the money to spend on activities.The units are loud. The air con is also loud and positioned above a bed. The hotel is next door to a car rental. This was actually a great help as we decided on the spur of the moment to rent a mustang for an unforgettable drive around the island. We would have unlikely done this if we weren't over looking all the cars.The staff were really kind and accommodating. We had the units attended to every day of our stay and they had everything we needed to enjoy our holiday in Waikiki. Would I stay here again - with the partner, no; with my mates though, probably!

The bathroom provided near the lobby gives a bad impression of what is to come as the room we had was great, newly renovated, clean and comfortable with a great kitchen area and cosy beds. The only down points were that the curtains let through too much light from the apartments behind and a curtain between the main bed and the sofa bed would be perfect for those travelling with small children. We would definitely stay again.",Perth,"bendy452</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth</strong>",3,5.0

I knew when I booked that the office was a block over. It had good reviews. We go to the office the girl tells me there is no parking, go down the street and pay 10 dollars for ten hours then you can move your car back here. Now understand we are tired from travel. I am not a happy camper. We drive back around the block to unload a family of 4 with 2 children a sleep up the stairs to the 3rd floor. After going back and forth 5 times. I come down to find I am about to get a parking ticket because there is no parking. The police let me move the car without a ticket. I go down the street to the parking garage. The guy tells me it will be $15 dollars and I have to move the car at 8:30.Now it is late so I set my alarm with the family sleeping I walk the block over ask where to move the car and a new girl at the front desk looks at me and asks are you on the waiting list. I told her I am going to park in space 3 load up my family by 11 am and leave and that is what I did.Now the GOOD. I will say the hotel is old but the room has a full kitchen, hot water, good internet. Great location. At the front desk they have great coffees and morning snacks. Beach toys to use and young people just hanging out having funIf you don’t need a car and can be happy in a 2 star room with a full kitchen and a balcony with no chairs. This can be a great place.",San Diego,"iamthejwalker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",17,1.0

The hotel is actually a refurbished three level condominium building located roughly 100 meters from Waikiki Beach. The building is very close to most points of interest in Waikiki and at the same time it is set far enough back from the main strip as to avoid the worst of the congestion. The room was clean and comes with a full kitchen which was very useful. Four nights of every week they have a decent farmer's market right across the street from the building so if you get sick of restaurant food can you buy fresh ingredients and make a home cooked meal. The one issue we had which has been touched upon in other reviews is that there was no table or chairs in the actual unit when we arrived which would make it very if you are planning on cooking some of your own meals or even bringing take out food back to the room. I mentioned this to the front desk and by the time we came back from dinner on our first night they had placed a simple table and two chairs in our unit so problem solved. Evidently all of the units will be getting some dining stools and patio chairs in the near future. Generally speaking the unit provides good value at a great location and we would certainly stay the the Stay Condominiums Waikiki again.,"Toronto, Canada","Ronald V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

At least the sheets were clean, but apart from that, this place was a dump. The parking situation was awful. Three tiny spaces next to the premises, and don't think about moving your car--it's first come, first served, so you could lose your space. $25 for this.Check-in is at a different building--they gave an address, but I had no idea where it was. Eventually someone came to walk me over there, through a locked gate, then their laundry facilities and a rabbit warren of halls.My room location was so noisy--it was right by the gate where everyone staying there went in and out, slamming the door, shouting at their companions, clunking their suitcases up and down the stairs. I didn't feel safe or secure there, either.TV came with no instructions. No matter--there was no signal, either. It took an employee 30 minutes to get one station working, and that was all there was. The one lamp beside the bed was broken.No hair dryer.In spite of a kitchen, there was no place to eat--no table or chairs. $10 for amenities such as grab & go snacks, computer access in their lobby, coffee and use of beach equipment.Horrible value for the money they charge.","SF Bay Area, CA","love2bake</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>SF Bay Area, CA</strong>",8,2.0

The desk staff were some of the most friendly and helpful I have ever dealt with. Location was within two short blocks (5 minute walk tops) to Waikiki Beach and was better than we hoped for. Loved having a full kitchen so we could do our own food some of the time. We were able to walk to the start line and back from the finish line of the Honolulu marathon. The only reason this is not 5 star is because parking was an extra $20 to $25 per day unexpected (so budget for it) and the room was pretty dated.

This is a hotel with just 11 units. Check in was at the front desk of a larger hotel across the street. Hotel was 2 blocks off of the main part of Waikiki Beach.

The accommodations were simple, comfortable and affordable...which was exactly what I needed. The rooms were quiet and clean, and had a full size kitchen! Which was nice as I prefer not to eat out and was able to purchase healthier options to prepare myself.The condo's were located behind the Stay Hotel, but I liked that it was more private and separate from the hotel. I also appreciated the gated keycard entry to obtain access to the units. As a woman and staying alone, this made me feel very secure. Everything I could possibly need was within walking distance as well, which was very convenient. I was surrounded by markets, restaurants and shopping, so I didn't have to deal with the hassle of driving anywhere and fighting traffic. My daughter probably appreciated this as well, since it meant I had plenty of time to go buy her things in the evening. :)Overall, I had a great stay. I will certainly stay here the next time I am in town, as it feels more like a small apartment than a hotel room...Really had a nice home away from home feel to it. :)","New York City, New York","Ava L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,5.0
