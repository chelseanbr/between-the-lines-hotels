But it was one of the better experiences I’ve had at a hotel in New York City. The hotel is located near some great food spots and shopping. We were greeted by Toni Hudak upon our arrival and she was fantastic. She gave us all that we needed to know about the hotel and even suggested eating at the restaurant located in the hotel called The Usual. We ate there for lunch and it was delicious. Toni also helped us out with getting cupcakes for my sons 4th birthday. She was so nice to go out of her way and have it ready for a surprise. Not only was she very helpful but she is very friendly & made our stay an excellent one. This hotel is lucky to have an employee like Toni! The room itself was very clean and we had a corner room with a direct view of the Empire State Building. They also have a happy hour for guests with free champagne, wine & cheese plate. The next morning they served complimentary breakfast (pastries, yogurt & fresh cut fruit) which was great! Toni was there & she even got juices for my 2 small boys and let us know tea/coffee was ready for guests. I definitely recommend staying here because we will back for sure!

We were able to leave our bags at reception while we ate and had drinks, very fine. Once we were done, we headed upstairs to our room 705. It was cozy, with a modern-idustrial feel. This was a balcony room, and although freezing, we had to spend some time out there taking in that view (The Empire State Buiding and Chrysler , among others). They have great black out curtains to keep the city out once your ready to hit the hay. The mini bar is decent, stock with gin/wine/whisky and some soft drinks. There is also a snack drawer that you can pick from if you get a midnight craving. The pillows were great, with the perfect level of firmness.

It's a short walk to so many amazing places, and a couple of blocks from a number of subway stops. - Staff were great- The little extras that were improved from last time - the basic breakfast and lobby coffee plus happy hour every day - The design of the hotel - rooms are small but they are functional and well thought out. Plenty of bench space in the bathroom, loved having a balcony to open to fresh air and really love how much natural light the rooms get. - Incredibly well priced when we stayed. The street is pretty noisy so level 5 and above is best. There aren't power outlets at the head of the bed, which is a bummer but totally manageable.

Probably the most egregious flaw that stuck out to us was the chill that permeated the hotel. Upon arriving at night, we decided to eat dinner at the restaurant in the lobby. I’m not one to easily get cold, but the restaurant was so cold that even though I was wearing a sweater, I was anxious to get my bill and get out. Arriving in our room, we found the same experience. Cold room, cold floors. Turning up the heat helped a bit, but the heat would constantly turn itself off and we were back to the same problem. For me, a hotel room should offer a respite from the outside world, but I often felt like I was camping because of the chill in the room. The hallways outside were also especially cold. The weather outside was in the 30’s-40’s so it's not like it was absurdly cold outside, but the pervasive chill made me just want to stay under the covers in our room. Another unsettling aspect was the noise from honking horns on the street. It wasn't pervasive, but from around 3:00-7:00 PM, traffic was backed up on Kenmare and you could clearly hear cars honking their horns for the entirely of that time.  Another miscue is the layout of the room. The layout seemed very inefficient and clumsy. For example, the water closet (toilet) is located by the front door but the bathroom and sink are located around the corner and on the other side of the room, meaning that you have to walk all the way around to wash your hands. The bathroom had its own problems. The towel rack is awkwardly stuck on a wall behind the head if the bathtub making it extremely difficult to get to. We had to shimmy between the tub and the wall to get to it. The shower head turns on when you turn on the water, meaning you'll get a shock of cold water on your arm when turning on the water. Another awkward placement is the curtain to look outside. It’s located behind a chair, meaning you once again, have to shimmy behind the furniture in order to get to something. The room lights were also awkwardly located and took a while to figure out. Finally, the corner of the wooden bed frame stuck out at shin level, and given the tightness if the room made it possible to bang your shin. The TV remote was unresponsive and difficult to change channels. Sometimes the TV would unexpectedly turn off. The Wi-Fi was slow and practically useless. With these criticisms being said, there are some positives. I do like the neighborhood, which is close to Chinatown and Little Italy. They offered a limited continental breakfast in the morning. I had a croissant which was pretty decent. I did like the bathtub. It took the chill off from the cold, cold room. If this were a budget priced hotel, I could forgive a lot of the above criticisms, but I don't think you can put a nice lobby in a hotel, throw a few nice touches in a room, but have glaring errors in basic hotel needs. Most hotels give you a sense of relaxation after a day of being out, but this place just made me want to go home to a warm place where things actually worked.","St. Louis, MO","seamonkeee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. Louis, MO</strong>",101,3.0

This hotel is great for a solo traveler, but I wouldn't recommend staying here if you need to share a room with friends or family.Here are some pros and cons about my stay:Pros:-Staff: The staff was friendly and really helpful.-Location: The hotel is within walking distance of SoHo, Little Italy, and Chinatown. You won't have any problems finding a place to eat or shop at. The Usual (restaurant) is also connected to the hotel.-Amenities: Some amenities my room came with are a hair dryer, slippers, yoga mat, mini bar, iron, and ironing board. I do wish the room came with a free water bottle. I did see an Ethernet wall connection, but didn't test it. The speed of the free WiFi was moderate. The AC/heating unit also worked well.-Other: I had a few deliveries sent to the hotel. They all made it to the hotel and the staff held my deliveries if I wasn't there to receive them. Cons:-Room layout: The shower and sink area and the toilet room are on separate sides of the front entrance. The shower and sink area also didn't have a door to close it off. The front door is visible from the shower door, which is all glass. If two people shared a room and someone was showering, the other person wouldn't be able to go in and out of the room because the shower might be visible from the outside if you opened the front door. I suggest installing a sliding door to block off this area.-Outlet locations: There are no electrical outlets next to the bed. I use my phone as my alarm so thankfully I brought an extra long charing cable that reached the bed. I wish there was at least a USB charging dock on one of the bedside tables.-Outside noise level: The hotel is on a busy street so you hear cars honking until midnight. I sleep late so that was okay for me. If you sleep early and are a light sleeper, you might have trouble sleeping. However, the inside of the hotel was very quiet.-Other: The rooftop area is closed. I was told they are renovating it to be a bar.","San Francisco, California","ttpham678</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",6,4.0

Told me about a good one they had but they were out of them...Very disorganized at that front desk with some guy always popping out of the back room to join in questions. Odd. But what was really disappointing was upon check out was when I asked about transport to midtown, they offered to call black car. I said I need a cab, the guy pops out from the back and says well, walk to Bowery, because they don't come down our street. Which is not correct. Bowery is two blacks away and I had an enormous suitcase. Very poor customer service. I will skip this place next time I want to be in the area. The location does not overcome its shortcomings.....no matter how hip they try to be. They are trying too hard in that way, and dropping the ball on customer service.

I wanted to keep this place my little secret, but sharing is caring.If any problems (I really didn't have any) They had only one pair of slippers inside and one robe which is standard that's fine I get it. They can always bring more up, just ask them at the reception desk. They were warm and friendly. Before I could finish my request the receptionist was like ""Right away sir !we are sorry."" Great service! All the amenities where functioning. If you need something just ask. If they don't have something they usually say.""Let me see what we can do"" I appreciate that effort. Other hotels I have been to usually are like ""really we thought we put one in there"" well your wrong fix it. I hate that especially if you get a deal on the hotel. They make it like your taking money from them. Um, I'm sorry I'm a customer.Do your self a favor, First time or not to NewYork city if you at Nolitan Ask to go to the roof and get a view of New York City. They have what I call a nice ""infinity lookout"" the parapet is made of glass windows. You can just look out and enjoy the view. if you're by yourself just listen to some soft Jazz music. Nice controls for the room for the right setting. The bed was nice and comfy. It didn't feel like I was l floating on air or anything but, it did feel like a nice warm hug. your know The type you get when you where a small kid after walking all over Disney land till your little legs can't walk anymore, and your parent pics you up. Their walking pace the body warmth and sound of their heartbeat puts you to sleep...... Like that! The window curtains are blackout curtains, I forgot not only what day it was but the time the curtains were so dark. The outside noise was defined enough to the sound of a white noise fan at night which is as good as your gonna get in New York. I was on the fourth floor. I recommend higher floors for any New York hotel. Listen you came to New York right? Capital of the world. It doesn't sleep keep that in mind. Get a higher floor where ever you go, not just cause of sound but you want the view. It's like looking down on the big skeleton clock and at night, it's like a skeleton clock with neon gears.I tried Bnb's apartments before and they are a hit and miss I just rather come to Nolitan.Do yourself a favor. If it's your first time visiting the area, ask downstairs for bike check out go to a central park for a ride around. Or walk through the neighborhood by NYU. I have seen more movie stars here than in California. Jason Mamoa was walking down the street on Mott and Prince coming from the pizza shop on prince street. Just like that. Maybe it was timing but then I went to Prince street pizza shop and saw his pic with others that come and visit. oh, there pizza is good too...get the square slices. Come at (11 a.m).If you're a foodie, NewYork this is the place to be! Any spot of your epicenter to start your trip, I would use this Nolitan hotel. if you want a New York sandwich to go to Parisi bakery. You are not too far from Katz delicatessen but everybody goes there. (Please keep in mind if you wanna try these places out. You gotta go around 11 a.m before the lines start. Plan ahead know what you want before going, or you will get cursed out of the line..... like I'm serious). They have some Michelin star rated restaurants near Houston street. It would take me a good 5 months just to try out all the places within a mile radius from the hotel from just walking up and down Mott street. you find all these cross streets with restaurants that have been in NewYork for years perfecting their craft. If you see a line its good. Just go the next day though( you can tell I don't like lines).If you don't want to leave the Hotel The Usual Restuarant dinner is great! I have no fav all around good. I would like to highlight the service. I came late at night before the cap off. They had a good midnight desert. Big brownie cookie in a little skillet with ice cream on top. They have a good selection of wines. A cabinet of liquors and wines from the bartender's waist all the way up to the ceiling. The environment was warm and quite. I was craving some chips. You know just one of those midnight cravings. I asked the bartender "" Hey man you got any like leftover chips or something"" He looked at me and was like"" you know what let me see what I can do"" boom homemade taro chips! He went the extra mile I will come back Thank you. I also had a stain on my suit from a restaurant I was previously out. A bartender had to tide pens on hand and club soda.For the Nolitan hotel, morning breakfast was light and enjoyable. it's not like bacon and egs farmer breakfast. It was a nice business breakfast. crossaints where warm, love the cranberry muffins. everything was fresh. Love the chocolate croissant muffins. basically its enough to get you going not too much to wreck you from going out and enjoying the sights.My wife and I where an 8-min walk away from the 6 Train. 15min walk BD trains. 8 min walk Broadway for shopping and 8-min walk to Canal street. My wife was happy lots of places to shop and window shop.Your not to far from little Italy or china town. So if your idea is seeing New York without having to stay in Jersey or by the airport or 42nd (42st street is a tourist trap don't get a hotel there! not my cup of tea you will be up all night)Nolitan hotel is the place you want to be. You won't lose time. Other hotels might be cheaper but you pay for it through travel that's what happened to me last time at another hotel I got burned I learned and I move on. Here you forget the rental car, you take the subway or worst case, call a cab. You do not want to rent a car. You will look forever for parking.Close by if you want NewYork pizza you can go to Lombardi's for lunch then rice to riches for dessert.All in all, if I'm New York Manhattan and want to cover a lot of ground in little time. I'm using this place. It is my second time staying here. I look forward to my third visit one day. Nice Job Nolitan!",,Josh M,2,5.0

Everyone working there were great really, shame they had to deal with the party that completely thrashed a room on New Years.The room itself was small but still a good size for 2 people. The bed was comfortable but the pillows were too hard to my liking(everyone has different pillow preferences though). Really didn't see the point of the window from the room into the shower or the lack of a door, but I guess I'm weird for wanting guaranteed privacy in the bathroom. A lot of the channels on the tv didn't work properly. Not a big deal as we didn't go to New York to stare at a screen, but it can be nice to watch something before going to sleep.

Loved it the 1st tine but not as much this time. It was hot outside - the lobby was always kind of warm. I could never get my room temp below 73 even with the ceiling fan on high and the temp set on 68. All i wanted was a cold room. The phone in the room didn’t work. It’s a nice hotel with small but good rooms. The rooftop area offers a great view but unfortunately the bar up there isn’t open (would be a nice place to have a drink). No gym on site but guests have access to Gym NYC a few blocks away. I was definitely not impressed with the gym. Very old equipment with a few out of service. Gym was a bummer. Hotel now has a little bit of food out in the morning and a little cheese and wine in evening. I like to ear at Butchers Saughter across the street for breakfast (sooooo good) so I only got a little fruit each am. Kind of weird that they have bowls and silverware out but no place to put the dirty ones. People just leave their dirty bowls sitting on the couch. Suggest that they either use paper plates and plastic ware you can throw away or have a places to put dirty dishes. It looks pretty low end the way they do it now (although I do give them credit for trying; it could be nice with a few changes). Overall I’d still recommend the hotel. Neighborhood is great and it’s reasonably priced, but I may try another place in the area next time to compare especially if in the summer as I want a cold room.","Chicago, Illinois","shopgirl312</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",8,4.0

I got the ""Timeless Romance Rate"" which comes with champagne, chocolate dipped strawberries, and white rose petals to spread on the bed. The staff made sure that upon arrival the strawberries were fresh, and that the petals were refrigerated so that they didn't wilt. Another part of the great service was that I emailed The Nolitan the week of my arrival to make sure everything was prepared and I even asked them if they could help me surprise my boyfriend by allowing me to check in with my friend to decorate the room with Christmas decor, but pretending like I was checking in for the first time when I returned with my boyfriend. The staff was super helpful, friendly, and genuine. When I needed extra supplies like slippers they immediately brought it up. Whenever my boyfriend and I bumped into staff through the halls or on our way in or out of the hotel they greeted us with a smile and asked us if things were going well.The Nolitan Hotel also has an awesome minibar, and a wide variety of amenities, which I didn't use, but was great to know that it was available to me. For example, you can ask for a lap-top, I-Pad, and even rent a cool vintage looking bike to get around the city!I booked the suite so I had a bedroom and living room. The living room was very spacious and clean. The couches were clean and comfortable, and so was the pull out bed. There is an elegant modern chandelier hanging above a luxurious brown ottoman. The T.V. was bigger than I expected. The closet was very spacious which had a minibar/minifridge. I've been to hotels where you can't put stuff in the minifridge because of how it is set up, but I was able to use this one to put in additional drinks.I also got a beautiful view of the Empire State Building lit up in Christmas colors to top off a romantic evening! The bathroom was amazing in that there was a tub and a shower stall next to each other. There is actually a curtain separating the bathroom and bedroom and I makes the bathroom seem much more spacious when you can bath while looking into the living room. I really liked that the toilet was in an room on its own (water closet). The bathroom mirror was wide and clean as well - I can't emphasize enough how clean this room and hotel was.The bedroom was very spacious with a lot of drawer space to put your belongings in, which came in very handy since I had brought quite a few Christmas decorations. The bed was clean and beautifully prepared, and the flower petals added an elegant and romantic touch. There is also a T.V. in the bedroom. I just wished it could have been as big as the living room T.V. and not pop out as much as it is positioned between the bed and the wall. You don't get much of a view from the bedroom as there is a condominium being constructed next door, but that didn't bother me much since I had a nice view in the living room.I also would like to mention that the lighting in this suite was very soothing. I like that there were enough light fixtures to make the place bright, but it still had a dark, cozy, and relaxing feel to it. We also got complimentary breakfast which ranged from freshly baked croissants, yogurt, fresh fruit, and juices. And from 5PM - 8PM we were also able to get complimentary wine, cheese, and grapes from the lobby. Also, I must say that I had very respectable, quiet, and clean neighbors (non-smoking) neighbors. Overall, The Nolitan Hotel is definitely a contender among the hotels in the Lower East Side. Not only are the rooms luxurious and affordable, but the staff went above and beyond with their service, kindness, and sincerity - something that not all hotels can provide no matter how high-end it is. I can't thank them enough for helping my boyfriend and I have a memorable and very merry Christmas weekend!",,Armando R,1,5.0

Check in was a breeze and the lovely staff suggested we check out the rooftop for views - which were, as promised, not to be missed.We had a neighborhood room on the 7th floor facing Kenmare street and noise wasn't an issue. It was lovely to get a glimpse of the Empire State Building each morning and evening.The room was what I consider to be standard NYC size and we were really comfortable in it. In a big plus, the toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom so there is plenty of space in the bathroom itself. The bed was really comfortable, the design was sleek and fun and the turn down service (closing of blinds, slippers out) was a nice touch Everything was very clean and tidy. The lobby sitting area is as gorgeous as it appears in photos and if we had longer there, I would have no doubt I would have hung out in the space a bit longer.Location is AMAZING, I loved being mere steps from the beautiful streets of Soho and Nolita, it's really my favorite part of the city.

Location is great - near Soho & Little Italy. Check-in was easy, friendly and I got a room earlier than I thought which was nice because I got into city early in the am. The first thing I noticed when I walked into the room was spotted dirty windows. Rooms are small, but typical for NYC. Toilet was not with sink & shower - it’s in a sparse white closet with broken floor tile. Some good attention to branding/detail (slippers, robe, etc). I lied down to rest before going out and woke to a maintenance man walking into room to check the shower. Didn’t knock...he quickly apologized and left. (Not sure what was wrong with shower - worked fine later). Rooms are VERY noisy from street traffic, but they supply ear plugs if you ask. Beds are comfy and air/heat is quiet. There is no restaurant or room service - but all literature and website still says there is. Coffee and some pastries are served in the lobby. I booked the trip through Tablet Plus which offers an upgrade, a bottle of wine & some other perks. They had no record of it so I didn’t receive any of those things. Was a little annoyed, but that may be a Tablet Hotel issue. Not sure I’d stay again. Nice front desk staff but, the overall vibe is a bit depressing to be honest. ",,Jennifer V,5,3.0

Our room had a balcony and while there wasn't too much to see, you could see the empire state building which was cool. ConsThe road the hotel is on leads directly onto the Williamsburg Bridge. Not sure if there was construction going on but the traffic going east was bumper to bumper constantly which meant the horn honking was OUT OF CONTROL. During the day all you could hear was construction vehicles from across the street. I would say from about 1am-5am it was mildly quiet but that was it.

It had a nice bed, a good spacious window for natural light, and it had everything I expect from a hotel room.A good plus is that I could request earplugs at the desk free of charge. A very appreciated convenience for the city.Unfortunately I think there were just a few things about the experience where I was unlucky. For starters, when I walked in the room the first time, the bathroom was already locked from the inside. I don't really know how this happens but this was easily solved by calling the front desk. However the more impactful thing for me was the poor quality of the so called ""high-speed"" internet that is included with the room. I think there is a chance that the room I had just had poor coverage but the internet was so slow that an instant message took a minute to send. I could barely call people with VOIP which was something I really needed to do on my trip. However, when I woke in the morning, and head into the cafe, the internet quality was great, which is why I think it might have just been the room I was in. Again, a little unlucky, but if they can, they should try and ensure consistent wifi quality.The third, and somewhat most negative experience I had with the hotel is that the room was reserved with another card than my own but they charged the stay on my card, the one I used when I checked in. I discussed with them and arranged authorization to pay via a money order instead of my card. Not only did they give verbal and written confirmation that they wouldn't charge my card, but they charged my card anyway a day after receiving the money order. I'm still dealing with this a week after I stayed. I've never been charged the night with the card I check in with at a hotel before. Maybe this is more normal to them but they should be clearer about their procedure to smooth things over.As much as I loved the room, there were too many issues with service and payment for me to give this a perfect rating. The frustration with just trying to pay the hotel at all was enough to spoil the experience.",,Daniel S,3,3.0

When it was time to pack up the car (shortly before our dinner reservation), the garage noticed that the tire was flat. Now - most hotels would have said call AAA and best of luck to ya, but not the stellar team at the Nolitan! The manager, Sheldon, personally walked me to the garage and - by golly - we figured out how to change the darn tire (I did get AAA on the line, but it was going to be an hour wait). After we checked the damaged tire into the concierge (I'm pretty sure that was a first for them) we were able to make it to dinner on time! The great service didn't stop there. Fortunately, there is a tire repair shop right across the street. Now your normal hotel would have handed over your tire and pointed across the street. Not the stellar Nolitan team! Then even rolled my tire to the repair shop, so I didn't need to get dirty. Tire fixed 20 minutes later, and I was back on the road to Massachusetts. Above and beyond the service, the hotel is in a great location with lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping a stones throw away. I had the best omelette of all time at the Egg Shop, right next door. The only down side is that the Nolitan is on a busy street, which can be noisy if you are a light sleeper. But the hotel provides ear plugs or a noise machine should you need them. We will definitely be back again! Many thanks to Sheldon and the staff.

But drivers honking their horns for long periods of time and trucks reversing all day and night is neither romantic nor ambient; it's noisy and disruptive.I was appointed a 3rd floor room that offered zero respite from the perpetual noise. Immediately after stepping into the room, I requested a room change but was told the hotel was fully booked and that maybe I could switch rooms the following day. I admit I wasn't excited about the prospect of unpacking and packing twice for a 3-night stay and with only 8 floors and no noise proofing, I didn't think it would make much of a difference. I was told that all rooms face Kenmare St but upon looking at the evacuation map on my door, this turned out to be untrue.The room itself was thoughtfully laid out in an industrial design. The tv worked, the toiletries were nice, and there was a minibar.The housekeeping staff were friendly while the front desk staff were operating at a minimal service level.

Far, far beyond my expectations. I just can't say enough good things about the Nolitan, but I'm about to try.First, they rescued us from being left ""homeless"" by an AirBnB host who wouldn't address a door that threatened to lock us out if we left the apartment. Sherieka was wonderful on the phone and offered us a better rate than Trivago.com. Once we got there, they let us check in early, gave us an orientation to the neighborhood, and proceeded to generally treat us like royalty. The next morning, Sherieka and Michael chatted with me over breakfast in the lobby and gave me lots of recommendations for what and how to do NYC, including using the subway. Theirs are the only two names I have, but everyone there was gracious, professional, and helpful, including the evening clerk who poured me a glass of wine to enjoy up on the roof.The rooms are gorgeous, sleek and modern without feeling cold or austere, and the beds are comfortable in the extreme; only because there was so much to do and so little time did I not want to spend more time there. The building is insulated well enough that outside noise is minimal, and there was absolutely none from inside. The lobby is spacious with lots of comfortable chairs, the background music is great, and there's a great selection of reading material; all of which made an hours-long Saturday downpour more relaxing than frustrating. Also in the lobby are four complementary bikes, skateboards (!) and a supply of umbrellas.When we stayed, their restaurant was temporarily closed, but continental breakfast in the lobby is above average: fresh fruit, Greek yogurt, really good granola, and pastries. And as one last wonderful amenity, they have a car service to LaGuardia for $55 including tip, and watched our luggage after checkout until time to leave. We left with hugs from Sherieka, knowing our next trip to NYC will be timed for when the Nolitan has a room for us.","North Kansas City, Missouri","CathyC962</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Kansas City, Missouri</strong>",3,5.0

You can also track how busy The Butcher's Daughter cafe is, if you are inclined to visit, but there are so many great places to eat around, you just might skip it altogether.

The room was quite small and was lacking storage space. We spent there a week and we had to keep most of our clothes in suitcases. The rooms could be better maintained - there were some spots that weren't cleaned during our stay and after we checked in we had to ask for someone to clean the floor.Deluxe rooms are dual-aspect and they have restricted view towards Midtown and the Williamsburg Bridge. During our stay there was a construction going on in the opposite building so we had to keep the curtains closed. Kenmare St. is quite busy so there was a lot noise, also at night. The hotel has a roof terrace with an almost 360 degree view - really nice if you like to shoot night panoramas. The wifi works well and is free.We would stay there again but only because of the area and the reception staff.","London, United Kingdom","piotrGk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",8,4.0

Many aspects of the room have been thoughtfully designed, but not the beds. The location of the bed and the matress are not good. The air conditioning blew directly on our faces so I ended up turning it off while we slept, which was okay since there was a ceiling fan but not ideal. Also the matress is terrible, there was no support in it at all so my bad back was in agony. I didn't sleep well or much for the seven nights we stayed there. I tried sleeping on the floor and I tried adding pillows under my body - which did improve the situation but not sufficiently enough. My husband slept perfectly fine though. I did really like the style and furnishing in the room. The room has an open bathroom but private toilet. It has a large shower (no bath) with good shower pressure but as everywhere we stayed tricky to figure out how to use. There is a tucked away well stocked minibar, iron & ironing board, haridryer, robes, slippers and glassware. The only missing amenity from the room was an ice bucket, which we were able to request along with ice via reception. We had an inredible view looking uptown and we got upgraded to a balcony room. Unfortunately we are both too scared of heights to spend time out there, especially with those all glass barriers. However, I do commend them on the design of the bench seat to best utilise the small balcony space. Stylish sunken lobby lounge with books, games and bikes available to borrow. The staff are really friendly and helpful and the area is fantastic. There is so much quality food within a stones throw from the hotel. Unfortunately, Bread, the restaurant within the hotel is not one of them (great service and awesome drinks but average menu and food). However, the Egg Shop, Butcher's Daughter and L'Asso are all great, just to name a few. Pascale Jones is also meant to be great but we didn't get a chance to try it. There is also a rooftop that you can hang out on, which is fabulous. We got up early one morning (well I was already up cause I hadn't slept) and went to the roof to watch the sunrise. It was lovely. But you could grab some take-away from Xi'an Famous Foods on Kenmare Street (another great local food option) and pick up drinks from Wine Therapy on Elizabeth Street and enjoy it all on the roof. I also recommend getting your laundry, dry-cleaning and alterations/mending done at Eco Friendly (Zhang's Dry Cleaning) on Mott Street. The only thing that is keeping me from rebooking this hotel for our next stay is the bed. Otherwise, I would be back there in a second.","Brisbane, Australia","TheTravelTipster</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",17,4.0

The hotel location is fantastic, we first stayed at Times Square and after the initial awe of the lights it became clear that it wasn't 'real'. It was all geared up on the tourist dollar and it just didn't feel right. Times Square is great on your first visit, after that avoid at all costs. The Nolitan however is near Little Italy, Chinatown and within a reasonable walking distance to the Brooklyn and Williamsburg bridges. Spring street station nearby will get you anywhere you need to via Subway.The hotel is clean, the views are jaw dropping but most of all the staff make it what it is. I must mention especially Sheldon and Gene. Absolute salt of the earth guys and they are a credit to the hotel. The best member of staff however, as noted in other members reviews is Gustavo. Gustavo works tirelessly to ensure your stay is what you hope it will be. I ordered from a Mexican restaurant and they were not responsive an hour after delivery, I mentioned it in passing to Gustavo and he was kind enough to call them and speak in their language with a firm but fair attitude. The food arrived around 15 minutes later. You cannot walk through the hotel door when Gustavo is working without seeing his friendly smile and stopping for a conversation. You can easily spend an hour just chatting about everything in general and his knowledge of the area and the less tourist packed places is fantastic. I wouldn't consider staying in another hotel in future, maybe if Gustavo wasn't working here it wouldn't be the same and I would consider it, that's how much of an impact he has.

Easy access to anywhere in Manhattan and to LGA- the style is wonderful. Rooms are small but well-appointed, and very comfortable.The bad:- they cancelled the nightly wine and cheese. One can only surmise this is part of the partnership between the hotel and the adjoining restaurant, who were perhaps not pleased that the hotel was giving away food and drink. Shame.- the rooftop patio, while offering great views, is woefully under-utilized. It's a dead space that could be a wonderful meeting place.The ugly:- I hired a car to take us to the airport. The car was hired for 6PM. To me, that means that the car should be at the hotel at 5:45, at the latest. This is not a dinner reservation I'm going to; it's a flight. They won't hold the plane for me, so the hotel's job, as a service provider (and not a cheap one, as it happens), is to make sure I make my flight. Anyway, no car came by 6. I was assured that the car was coming, but they couldn't tell me exactly when.That, my friends, is unacceptable. A hotel should provide excellent service from the moment I arrive until the moment I leave. And this was a major oversight in their part. In the end, we got a cab.

I stayed at many hotels and saw lots of sights. I had lots of set backs. My truck broke down pulling into NYC, and I was struck by a hit and run driver on my Harley in Indianapolis. I arrived at The Nolitan disheveled to say the least. I was carrying not just my normal luggage but many of the items that I didn't care to leave in my truck while it sat outside the dealer waiting to be fixed. I was the perfect example of a hot mess. Sweaty, dirty, with 3 dogs, most items not even in luggage. Just about as bad an entrance as I could make. I believe it was Sheldon who set my mind at ease telling me I was in New York and that I could make whatever entrance I wanted and it was OK. Sheldon, Dorina and the entire staff made me and my guests feel like royalty from start to finish. When my stay, which was also my 45th birthday weekend, was over and my truck was not fixed. I was too be riding away on my Harley. They offered to hold some of my luggage until I could make arrangements to have it sent to me. Well, three weeks later here I come to claim my luggage. I was positive it was all at Goodwill by now. I almost didn't even call but I was passing by the city and figured I'd try. Of course they had my luggage still and gave it to me without any type of attitude or making me feel bad at all. I saw where they check your luggage. My bags were most definitely in their way for the last three weeks. But making guests feel bad isn't their style. I can't recommend The Nolitan highly enough. I'd give them 10 stars if possible. They are without a doubt my favorite hotel in the country and I spent a large part of the summer in $1-2 thousand dollar per night suites. Those big name chains have nothing on this cozy little SoHo hotel. I could have spent a few paragraphs telling you about the hip decor or the trendy neighborhood but quite simply the reason to stay at The Nolitan is because of Sheldon, Dorina and every member of the staff.

Anything you need, they're happy to help. The foyer is arranged with a recess where evening drinks and breakfast are on offer to guests; a nice informal touch. The room itself is clean and essential, with a post-industrial spartan finish which is fine by me. Free Wi-Fi works and is is welcome. The bed was comfortable, the shower powerful, and if you're in time, you can grab a bicycle to ride for as long as you like.

The floorpans are clever — we were in a corner suite with floor to ceiling windows and a unique centrally located tub that opened to the bedroom and living area on both sides — gobs of space and natural light. And the finishes are superb! Clean, modern fixtures and tiles, exposed concrete, and vintage furniture all come together to create a package that's eclectically modern. Awesome.3. Amenities.

Coming to the city as a tourist, I was looking for a clean, safe and well located hotel that was completely different from the big corporate chains. The Nolitan hotel and the team running it ticked all the boxes and more!The neighbourhood is great. Well located, within a 40 minute walk of Battery Park and a 40 minute walk of Times Sq. Its funky, but safe and friendly with a great selection of independent coffee shops, restaurants and interesting architecture. With Little Italy and Chinatown literally on the doorstep and the Village a short stroll away, this was a very different NYC than I normally see.We had a King Corner Room on the 7th floor. Very clean, great city views (Williamsburg Bridge, Empire State) and well equipped with a safe, well stocked fridge as well as a bath and shower. I am paranoid about bed bugs when staying in the city, couldn't find a single entry for Nolitan on the registry and the sheets were immaculate and the mattress had a cover, an undersheet and then the sheet we slept on. Pillows were amazing, very little traffic noise this high up and a choice of fan/aircon so the room was comfortable at all times. Slept brilliantly.The onsite restaurant ""Bread"" is now open and serves a full menu, though we only tried the wonderful croissants and muffins. Coffee could have been stronger, but the tea was good. We mostly ate around the neighbourhood, from cheap diners where we got a huge breakfast for under $20 to the higher-end where that was the starting price for a plate of eggs. This is New York after all.The staff were really helpful and friendly, answering lots of questions before the trip and making us feel very welcome while there. Their recommendations, including local restaurants, were good. At one point, one of the team lent us his metro card so we didn't have to buy one for a trip uptown. Stefanie in particular was always happy and helpful.There were a few good surprises, like the roof terrace with great views of the city in all directions and the fact that Booking.com honoured their price promise more than once as the price dropped in the weeks before the stay. There was also one unpleasant surprise - the car service the hotel booked tried to bump the price up within the first 30 seconds and then drove like a maniac.

The rooms are modern, clean and simple. They are also very loft-like, featuring concrete ceilings, exposed duct work, wooden floors with wide planks, and plenty of natural light. I like the comfy beds and high-end showers with glass walls. The lobby is modern, inviting, and unpretentious. The staff are casual, friendly, and exceptionally helpful, especially Gustavo and Sherieka, who took care of my every need. Wine and cheese are served every evening.

Little Italy and Chinatown are just a couple of blocks away. Bikes are available in the lobby for exploring the local area. There is a also a newly-opened eatery just a few steps from the hotel, called Bread, which is a great place to get breakfast, lunch or dinner, since there is no restaurant onsite.

The hotel gives perfect access to a huge variety of dining options, many of which have plentiful vegan options. My room was very modern and clean, albeit slightly small. The size wasn't an issue for me however, as I was there on business and spent most of my time out. They have a rooftop lounge which offers great views of the mid-town and down-town skylines, however, it was a little disappointing that they didn't offer refreshments there - seems like an opportunity missed.

We drove down from upstate NY, found a spot right on the street (we can't believe it either), and fell right into the rhythm of the neighborhood. The Nolitan Hotel is right at the heart of Nolita (north little Italy) It's charming, with flares of luxury, yet unpretentious with friendly and down-to-earth staff. As soon as we arrived we were greeted by warm smiles at the reception desk. The lobby felt elegant but also inviting- pieces curated for beauty and comfort too. We spent some time sitting and sipping the complementary wine provided in the lobby. I tried the red, and was impressed. Small appetizers were provided as well, which helped take the edge off my hunger from our travel into the city. They seem like small things, but having food and wine as soon as you arrive somewhere is a marvelous start to a relaxing stay. It gave us time to unpack, explore the hotel a bit, and take time choosing where we wanted to go for dinner. Our room was incredible! We stayed in one of the corner room suites- 8th floor. The first thing that hit me was how cool and peaceful the room was when we walked in. It was a hot muggy day, noisy in the city, but the room had been perfectly prepared and cooled down before our arrival. (no fidgeting with thermostats I don't know how to work) I also noticed how quiet it was- we never heard our neighbors or folks in the hall! The layout and design of the room was breathtaking. The bathroom opens up into the living room with views straight north to uptown Manhattan, a straight shot to the Empire State building, and east to the bridge. (The bathroom has a curtain you can pull between the tub and living room for privacy, but we never wanted to obstruct the open feel of it all.) Gorgeous! Small details made us feel at home such as luxurious robes, comfy slippers, fun magazines, and a pantry full of snacks, drinks and souvenirs from the Nolitan. There was even a yoga mat! A delicious variety of Nespresso pods gave us options for gourmet coffee/espresso in bed. My favorite part of the room was the tub. It's such a beautiful highlight in the center of the suite- like something out of a Pinterest dream board! The water was perfect- great pressure, no waiting for the hot water... I drew a bath, placed a few drops of frankincense in and relaxed with a glass of wine while looking out through the floor-to-ceiling windows at the city through sunset. The location of the Nolitan Hotel is fantastic. We grabbed amazing Mexican food at La Esquina just two blocks walk with a 5 min wait for tacos etc; amazing pizza right across the street at L'asso. The Butchers Daughter, diagonal to the hotel is a great cafe where we also saw different celebs coming for brunch. Best of all, downstairs from the Nolitan Hotel is the newly opened Bread. A fabulous Italian cafe/restaurant with great cappuccinos, breakfasts, and full service all the way through dinner. It's hardly 10 steps from the lobby of the Nolitan. The Nolitan has been my favorite hotel experience yet in NYC. With so much to do and see in the neighborhood- and fun bikes you can take from the lobby to explore- it's the best boutique hotel, and really the best way to experience NYC in its truest sense. It absolutely gets 5 stars! ",,AndreaLaraHarris,1,5.0

Although we have stayed in the city (Manhattan) several times, we had not had the chance to thoroughly enjoy this fun 'nabe' north of Little Italy and almost directly east of SOHO. Needless to say, Nolita is a premier location for pretty much anything you have planned to do on your NYC weekender. From shopping to dining and bar hopping to people watching, the Nolitan was the perfect spot. At the hotel itself, the modern, and welcoming lobby gave way to a friendly reception desk & concierge staff. Besides being very knowledgeable about the area with plenty of great recommendations, they were extremely helpful in getting us last minute reservations to a nearby and fun speakeasy/restaurant (La Esquina) that came highly recommended as a 'must-see-and-do' from several friends (thanks Michael & Sherika!). The staff was willing to walk down to the place while we were shopping to make sure they spoke to the right person and get us on the list! We were impressed and the spot did not disappoint. The suite we booked (Suite 801) was surprisingly quite large for a new boutique hotel in the city- which are typically known for being smaller than the national average. It was in the corner of the building so it had two window-walls that flooded the room with natural light but had window treatments and black-out curtains for a restful night's sleep. I get hot very easily and it is summer so I thought a well-lit room would mean a warm-ish stay but I was so pleased at how cool the suite stayed all day and night. Besides the modern furnishings and raw concrete columns/ceilings (Eames lounger and all), the layout of the suite was clever. The living room was by the spectacular views of Midtown (with clear view of the Empire State Bldg) and the ample bed-room (king size bed) was set towards the back of the suite with the bathroom placed in between both spaces. The soaking tub and rain shower head was predominantly featured in the room to allow for light and an openness in the entire space(see picture). Yet there was an optional curtain wall that provided total privacy for more shy occupants. The suite also had all the amenities you would expect to have in a quality hotel, like terry-cloth bath robes, slippers, free wifi and a portable media console, but it also had several novel ideas that just made our stay extra special, like a yoga mat, umbrella, Nespresso coffee machine with pods, and bicycles to borrow. At sunset we would hit the rooftop lounge area to rest our feet from the day's worth of exploring, shopping, and eating! The sunset skies over Midtown and Lower Manhattan were stunning. The deck practically has 360-degree views which is rare in this city filled with buildings competing for air-space. It was the perfect little break in our evenings before heading out for dinner and drinks. The Nolitan just opened up a new restaurant off of their main lobby named BREAD, a casually-chic, modern Italian fare, which relocated here from a close-by but smaller location. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast there before check-out and were happy to see that they had an outdoor/side-walk dining option, perfect for people watching in this vibrant neighborhood. Our Nolitan weekend was even better than we hoped it would be and most of that positive experience is attributed to our stay in this amazing boutique hotel.

We booked this hotel for a work trip over 2 months ago. 2 days before we arrived we received an email telling us that there is no hotel restaurant and room service. Then the day before we received another email welcoming us and proudly announcing their new restaurant. Very confusing! On arrival we find that the restaurant is a building site, and that there is no room service. I'm told that it's not their restaurant, which sounds a bit weird to me. They talk about it in promotional emails and on the website, so it sounds like their restaurant to me. The hotel has offered to send out for food if we want, and there is continental breakfast in the lobby. Fair enough offer. What annoys me is the lack of honesty. I'm sure they are trying everything to keep their bookings and revenue, but that's not my problem. On the hotel website they are still promoting bed and breakfast and the restaurant and room service. The room is great, the location is good, but for $400 to $500 a night, I'd like a cup of coffee in my room. It's sparing with the truth at best and we've not been offered any form of compensation. Be honest, come up with a better solution, a Nespresso in your room, a few bucks off, an alternative room service offer properly set up with a couple of local restaurants. Maybe even put their menus in the rooms. It's all very half hearted, and don't call me a 'Nolitan' on your welcome letter when this situation is occurring.

And, right by Elizabteh Street on Kenmare. The concept is also really nice. The lobby is a nice place to sit and work or just people watch. The Restaurant is closed and the renovation process is obviously disturbing in terms of construction noice. Also, this means there's no breakfast or dinner at the hotel. The roof terrace seems abandoned. No flowers or anything. Weird, since it could be really amazing. The corner suite is really nice in terms of furnishing. The bed is great. The details aren't really there. Seems like the contractor was not used to doing high end boutique styled builds if you look into details. Also, I know this is NYC - but the rooms are really not for light sleepers. The windows are floor to ceiling, but I've stayed at other hotels in NYC with the same type of windows where the sounds have been effectively kept out. . Here they're not... The service is great.

I have always loved this area of New York for the boutiques, shops, restaurants. And now I found a delicious boutique hotel to make my home base. I splurged on a corner room with a deep soaking tub and floor to ceiling widows facing east and north which lit up the room in the mornings in a very nice way. The room had a yoga mat, a very comfortable bed, it was very clean and the bathroom well lit. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. I enjoyed the wine and cheese happy hour. And while the weather was cool for enjoying the outdoors, I made a stop to the rooftop and it is fabulous with almost 360o views of lower Manhattan. Summer at the Nolitan Rooftop must be great!

The beds are super-comfy and the wine and nibbles in the evening are a nice touch. We booked a corner suite with a tub (latter main reason for booking). Cost was $377 for one night. All confirmed by phone the night before.Arrive early afternoon. Staff full of apologies, due a leak no corner suites available. So we get downgraded to next level (much smaller room, no tub), $70 off bill and a complimentary bottle of cava. Well, these things happen, but pissed that $70 just means we are simply paying the rate for a room we wouldn't have booked in the first place. Next morning rate for night being charged is $370 (after we open the envelope and look at bill while at the desk). So..... $7 off for a room we didn't want and wouldn't have booked (plus a bottle of cava we didn't drink). After checking and then complaining we get apologies for overbooking (so not a leak after all) and $70 plus taxes refunded. So essentially still paying almost full price for room we wouldn't have booked, being downgraded, lied to and then attempted overcharging. We leave. Then subsequent email full of apologies and another $100 off. But a bit late to be honest. Get your stories straight guys, and if you are going to overbook and then downgrade: 1) let us know when we ring the day before; 2) don't make up stories about leaks; 3) agree proper compensation upfront and stick to it.

Overall it was a good choice but a few issues may be important for some travellers. The hotel faces Kenmare street (the continuation of Delancey beyond Bowery) which can be rather noisy at times. Personally I dont mind traffic noise it that it's not too direct but some people may sleep bad due to that. Second (at least the room I had) there bathroom (apart from the WC) is open-air/loft style so privacy may be reduced. As with traffic, I did not mind but again some travellers may be affected. Overall rooms seem to be a bit on the low-size edge but that's normal in ny unless you really pay a lot. There was enough storage space and room details were all fine. The lobby with its afternoon drinks and finger food is also rather welcoming. Useless to say, position is great for access to east/west village, Chinatown, financial district....and the area is full of restaurants and design stores and all you can aim to buy and see. Yes, fan is rather noisy when you activate heating/cooling while you sleep....in my case i just needed it a few hours to warm up the room so I did not mind but I imagine it could be an issue if you needed through the night.",francoforte,"fabio-ff</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>francoforte</strong>",39,4.0

Nolitan is situated in one of the best neighborhoods in the city, walking distance to Soho, the LES, Village, FiDi, Tribeca, and even Williamsburg. If you want to get to know the cool side of town, the location is stellar. Art galleries, museums, boutiques and some of the best restaurants and nightlife in town. Early check-in and late check-out compared to other hotels so we never felt rushed. The staff is truly amazing and I believe that's what really makes this hotel super perfect. Special shout out to Gabriel as he was super helpful and made sure our honeymoon staycation was extra special!! The food at the restaurant is amazing!! Definitely have your meals there. We had complimentary breakfast during our stay. Complimentary wine and cheese in the evenings a nice touch. The hotel exudes a modern industrial vibe but very homely. The rooms are on the small side but corner room views are great, room service spectacular. I recommend an upgrade because the standard rooms were teeny for a couple. Complimentary bikes that rode beautifully, and I believe they have complimentary iPads, gaming systems, all that good stuff as well. The only issue with our stay was the heat in our room didn't work for 2 nights and it was freezing by the time we got back at 4am but they came immediately to try and fix and made sure to compensate for the trouble(thanks Eric!). It wasn't a super big deal and doesn't hinder me from giving it 5 stars. I've recommended my clients to stay at the Nolitan whenever they visit.

If you do not know, Nolita is about as perfectly located as it gets for current NYC living. SOHO is a block away, Chinatown is a block away, Little Italy is a block away, the Lower East Side is just down the street... etc, etc, etc...There are so many wonderful restaurants within walking distance that you could spend several days before needing to get into a cab, Uber or subway. Having said that, the Bowery subway stop is only a block away.The rooms are small, but wonderfully designed. I have stayed for a week and never felt cramped. If there are two of you, spring for the corner room, however, as it is larger and has an awesome soaking tub in addition to the shower. The design is really outstanding - if I remodel my house, this is how I want it to be and look - simple, beautiful and efficient.The staff is also superb. They are helpful in every way and super welcoming to repeat visitors. A few things to be aware of:1. This is not particularly a business hotel - they do not have a real business center, room service, coffee makers in the room, or any of the other things you expect in a hotel catering to business travelers. Having said that, I am a business traveler and stay here anyway as everything else taken together outweighs these shortcomings2. The dining option in the hotel is extremely limited. They kind of serve breakfast after 8, but honestly, it is clearly an afterthought at this point and is not really at the level of the rest of the hotel. See point number 1. Nothing but coffee and bread products until after 8? Doesn't anybody who stays here have to get to work? Again, there are so many options within a block that I do not care and would not eat here in any case, as I would want to explore the other options.I list these simply so that you know potential downsides going in.

A lot of consideration went into planning the NYC leg of our trip, the big decisions were choosing the right neighbourhood and whether to stay in a hotel or rent an apartment. We couldn't have chosen better! The hotel offered the ideal balance between the flexibility and local feeling from an apartment with the customer service and ease of a hotel.Firstly the neighbourhood is ideal, great local atmosphere, plenty of reasonably priced bars and restaurants within easy walking distance. There are a few subway stations ideally located to get around the city, we mainly used Grand St to go uptown, Spring St coming back and Bowery to get to Brooklyn/Williamsberg. LES is within easy walking distance for even more bars, or a cheap taxi ride. Secondly the hotel. We had a tall order for the perfect accommodation in NYC, and The Nolitian delivered. The hotel is very stylish without feeling like a gimmick. We stayed in a balcony room which I believe is one of the smaller rooms, however the design ensured the space was where you need it. Two girls with loads of clothes and make up and we were fine. The only thing I could say is the full length mirror is directly outside the bathroom door which meant knocking on the door before coming out when one of us was getting ready. The roof deck! The roof deck was a welcome surprise. Spacious with panoramic views around the hotel. Fantastic views of midtown in one direction with famous buildings like Empire State and Chrysler, Williamsberg bridge to the right, and the financial district to the rear. The hotel have seating and tables on the roof, and you are free to take your own food and drink there, which if you are watching your budget is great. There were a few days we got so entirely lost in the city we didn't get back to the hotel until 9pm and didn't want to freshen up and head to a restaurant, instead we got take away pizza from a restaurant across the road and a 6 pack of beer and it was great! The staff, so friendly and couldn't do enough to be helpful. Great recommendations on restaurants and bars, handy tips about getting about town. They will print of subway times and stations with directions to get you to your destination quickly (although I highly recommend getting lost of the subway and seeing where it takes you!).Flexibility, we found the team at The Nolitian were flexible with what we needed from our stay. We pre-paid breakfast and were able to order breakfast (to our room at no extra cost) any time between 7am and 3pm. The food was delicious with a menu with enough options to have something different each day with some interesting dishes. We pigged out so much at breakfast we didn't eat much at lunch time most days. Monday-Saturday between 5-7pm the hotel services wine, cheese and nibbles in the lobby which is free for guests. It was lovely and sunny most days so when we were around for it we took our wine and nibbles to the roof deck, or if we were getting ready to head out up to the room. Really nice touch. Although we didn't take advantage, the hotel also has bikes, skateboards, games consoles, laptops etc for hire free of charge. I highly recommend The Nolitian to anyone, and If I'm back to NYC I'll be back for sure!","Manchester, United Kingdom","nikkij_9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

Stephanie the agent at the desk was very upbeat and helpful. She gave us a rundown of what the hotel provided for us and the main thing that stood out was the HAPPY HOUR. Complimentary Wine and Cheese was a Cherry on the top especially after a long day out with the kids just to unwind. During the happy hour we got to meet some other guest who let us know this is the only hotel they stay in when they come to New York City and we see why. During that time we also got to interact with the staff. Sheldon especially he was a breath of fresh air besides giving us different options on what we should do while we were in this part of the city, he provided us with a couple good laughs and made sure he kept the wine coming.Now to the Hotel Itself. It was a beautiful design From the sunken lounge in the lobby to the beautiful rooms. The rooms were not very big but what else do you expect in NYC. It was very clean and we had a balcony on the 8th floor which gave us an AMAZING view at night of manhattan.

While there make sure to stroll around the corner and have traditional italian pastry and coffee at Ferrara's pastry shop.","Athens, Greece","maria p</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Athens, Greece</strong>",31,4.0

I'm in NYC for a few weeks and staying at different hotels to mix it up a bit. The Nolitan was a great experience. Smaller and quieter than some of the bigger hotels I've stayed in and that was welcome. The staff I spoke to were very friendly. Sometimes when I walked into reception I did feel a couple of the staff on reception could have been more attentive and perhaps looked up and said hello when I walked in. This happened on a couple of occasions and the girls I refer to weren't busy on the phone or with other customers- so I think that could be improved on. Just basis manners- but that was only applicable to a couple of people. It was outweighed by the friendliness of most of the staff. The room was a decent size. The balcony was great. It looked out onto Kenmare street and was great for people watching. It was clean and contemporary and the bed was very comfy. Loved the turn down service and the little chocolates left on my bed! The view was incredible. From my pillow I was looking at the Empire State!The roof terrace was stunning. Amazing views. Could see the whole of manhattan and the Williamsburg and Brooklyn bridges. It could have benefited from having a few sunloungers. There was some furniture up there but it wasn't the comfiest- but that's me being super picky!I love roof terraces so for me this was a huge bonus. The location is great. One street away is little Italy. And Chinatown. Soho is a couple or minutes away too. Lots of subways nearby. Some great eateries on kenmare/Elizabeth street/Mulberry/Mott. Loads of cool quirky places. Rice to Riches- the amazing flavoured rice pudding bar is on the next street! Omg! The Butchers Daughter across the road is wonderful. I have no complaints about this hotel. It really is excellent and somewhere I will be returning to. ,,Suey R,7,5.0

The design is very modern, with a lot of thoughtful details and quirky style. Overall, it was really comfortable, and despite being on a busy street in NYC, it was relatively quiet. The rooms are small, it's NYC for crying out loud, they all are! But they have everything you need, thoughtfully laid out, and they are impeccably clean. The furniture is ecclectic and it took me the entire three days to notice that the drawers (there wasn't a formal dresser) were in the bed base. Oh well, we lived out of the suitcase and survived it. The closet is small and has a small refrigerator that is stocked with the usual (and usual) overpriced mini-bar stuff. The OJ was welcome on a hot desperate day. In the late afternoons though, the lobby hosts a nice wine, cheese and fruit time which was a nice surprise. There's also a roof deck which was too hot during the day when we visited but I'm sure is nice in the evenings. The staff was universally nice and helpful as well. Honestly, couldn't find a thing to complain about except the pillows, which if we'd asked to have changed out for firmer/fluffier ones, I'm sure would have been accommodated. Oh and perhaps the wifi which, although free (thank you!) was sometimes intermittent and annoying. By the way, attached to the lobby is also a really nice cafe where we had a good breakfast and there are other restaurant options in the neighborhood as well.","Corte Madera, California","cali-mom2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Corte Madera, California</strong>",38,5.0

But despite its urban location, it immediately feels calm and relaxed upon arrival. The sunken lobby has the feel of an upmarket study with leather sofas, arch lights and bookcases but doesn't feel like its trying too hard. Between 5-8pm it becomes a quiet venue for complimentary wine and cheese evenings. Staff are polite and friendly without being overbearing while the rooms are clean, cool and comfortably furnished with modern but understated furniture. Mini bar appeared well stocked while there were other neat touches like branded yoga mats and t-shirts as well as free wifi. My very brief visit to the restaurant had a speedy and polite service with well presented and tasty food.As it was summer, the rooftop terrace proved something of an oasis from the bustle of the stifling heat with great views across the city. I understand there are plans to introduce a bar here which would be an excellent addition. Some reviews have mentioned traffic noise; I was situated close to the road on the second floor but heard nothing both nights.There is currently no room service while the new in house restaurant finds its feet and there are no in-room coffee/tea making facilities but given its proximity to the wide choice of local amenities, these are tiny gripes.A great place to stay if you're looking for a taste of everything New York has to offer.","Watford, Herts","Mark S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Watford, Herts</strong>",10,5.0

If you're looking for a lively nightlight scene you'll probably have to take a cab to another part of town; but if you're looking for a good place to stay as you soak up NYC culture and sip some mimosas over brunch, this is the right location for you. The staff was very friendly and the hotel even offers mid-day wine and snacks for patrons free of charge. The decor is fitting for the area and adds to the NYC vibe during your stay. The room was spotless and the room fixtures functioned properly. I'd suggest getting a room with a balcony or a corner room on a higher floor. The basic rooms can be a bit tight so coughing up an extra $50-$60 for the space is worth it. The hotel also has a fantastic rooftop with uninterrupted views of the Williamsburg Bridg, the Empire State Building and downtown Manhattan. Although it's not used to it's full potential, and can appear a bit bland at first, the rooftop is what you make of it and friends of guests are welcomed. Unfortunately, the restaurant and bar were not open during my stay. I would have preferred that the hotel disclosed this to you prior to your arrival, especially if I were a patron who liked to sleep, eat and drink all in the same location; but it wasn't that big of an issue. If you're in town for a weekend in summer, I'd suggest arriving early on a Saturday to take advantage of the hotel's day-time offerings. Familiarize yourself with the neighborhood a bit and pick out some spots which appeal to you so that you can make some reservations before the dinner/brunch rush. I look forward to going back once they've made some updates to the rooftop and re-open the restaurant/bar. Overall, 8.5/10.","New York City, New York","scap2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,4.0

Having previously stayed in the Novotel Times Square the Nolitan and surrounding area was a welcome break from $15 beers and 'hey guy do you like stand up comedy'. We loved it so much we booked again for our last stay, the 3rd to the 10th of July. On the 4th of July we got engaged on the rooftop at night waiting for the Macy's fireworks I couldn't have picked a better place. Each night the hotel does 'wine and nibbles' Where they lay on cheese, wines and biscuits in the comfortable, spacious and very well decorated lobby. All in the price of your room stay. The hotel rooftop offers great views all around, with plenty of seating. The rooftop is a great place to chill out and just sit staring into the city and just watching the world go by. I took my coffee and a cigarette there around 7am most mornings and felt complete nirvana at the surroundings, even with the infamous New York car horns it is a different kind of peace. The room itself was well decorated, clean and tidy and perfectly laid out. The bed was great and the shower was powerful which is a must for me wherever I stay. Basically I cannot rate the hotel high enough, and I cannot wait to get back. The months leading up to our return dragged as I was so excited and eager to get back! Finally, i have saved the best part of the hotel until last, the staff. Firstly let me say there was not one member of staff that I didn't like, they were all great that's unquestionable, the girls on the desk were cool and the staff around the hotel in general were friendly, however I cannot leave a review without noting certain staff. A good hotel cannot be great like the nolitan with poor staff, it just won't work. Whilst they were all great some stood out;Leo - the housekeeping manager, every day we would see him in the hotel with his clipboard marking off his list of rooms, everyday we were fortunate to meet one of the most friendly and happy guys you could wish to meet. There was never a time when he didn't have a smile and a few words to say. Sheldon - the first time Iv met sheldon as I don't think he was here when we stayed last year, great guy and funny too. Real funny. Hailed us a cab when we were leaving and the guy was almost in little Italy trying to pull us one down! Had a laugh talking to him about his college tutor too. Ameen - We were checked into the hotel by ameen, another friendly and pleasant guy who we spoke to over our stay about general things, was an interesting guy and really enjoyed talking to him. Gene - Gene im pretty sure was here when we stayed last year, however this time we got talking to him a lot more and he is one of the friendliest and funniest lads you could meet. Professional as he's at his place of work but down to earth too, real great guy all round. I hope the management know too that they've got a great guy in Gene. Lastly, Gustavo. - I cannot put into words what an absolute credit Gustavo is to the nolitan hotel, I'm sure they do but I hope the management know that all the staff they have are great, but Gus is on the next level. Iv seen him deal with things in a cool calm way whenever a hotel guest has asked him for help, even at midnight he was ringing up a takeout Id ordered from hurrying them up as they'd taken ages! Last time we stayed we got talking to him when we were going out or coming back to the hotel and he was friendly and funny, this time it was like seeing an old friend. We share a keen interest in the greatest football team in the world, Manchester United. I'm fortunate that staying at the Nolitan enabled me and my partner to meet Gus and i now class him as a friend. So yeah, Iv kind of got carried away, stay at the hotel and you will see why I have. You will not regret it.Thanks Nolitan staff, you've all managed to make a great vacation even better and I wish you all the best in your careers wherever they take you and hope to see you all again soon!","Manchester, United Kingdom","Dannyboymufc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",9,5.0

A surprise in the room was the glass shower in the room so I could look at the midtown and uptown Manhattan skyline (Empire State Building and Chrysler Building). It doesn't bother me but I could see how others might not like it. The best surprise was the small balcony with the bench. The glass border of the terrace made it feel more expansive than it actually was. The Hotel is well located... easy and quick walk to NoLITA, Chinatown, and Lower East Side.

The price is on the cheap side for the location. We stayed in room 202, a corner king suite. We requested to stay on a high floor when we made the reservation, but they can't honor requests. We had our hearts set on a view and being as far away from street noise as possible. They tell you they can ""take them into consideration"" but it's apparent that is a company line and their policy is strictly first come first serve. The second floor ended up being nice because you can get up the stairs quickly without waiting for the elevator and the walls + curtains are thick enough to make the view quiet. The view was still nice, even if not as high as we would have liked. The bathtub is beautiful and can fit two people easily. The shower was poorly designed and impossible to turn on without getting wet. The towels are also weirdly small. If you're taller than 5 foot and weigh more than 100 pounds, it will barely cover your body. The room had two robes, which were nice. The room was big by New York standards, but most people would find it small, but having lived in the city it seemed pretty generously sized. He pictures are deceiving, the floor-to-ceiling windows just span the corner of the room, but the longer of the walls is mostly wall with the window at the end. Curtains are great and block out most light but do not black out the room. The bed was comfortable and soft, the linens were great. The radio didn't have an aux cable for your iPhone. We didn't use the TV at all. They have a wine hour with free wine in cheese in the afternoon. Room service is delivery from a ton of choices from nearby restaurants. Which in New York, means a really diverse range of options. You can order breakfast from the restaurant downstairs on a card that you hang on your door any time between 5am. The food isn't mind blowing but it's good and some of it is organic. Wasn't impressed with the freshness of vegetables. Room cleaning seemed to keep weird hours. We left at 7am and when we came back at 2pm the room still wasn't cleaned. We had to call to have someone sent up later. Amenities are quirky and fun. They have valet, which is a plus. Complimentary bikes which are decent road bikes that are new and very cute. They have yoga available to guests at a gym nearby. The roof has a beautiful view, but weird and unfinished patio furniture. This ended up being nice because we brought our own wine up there and hung out. Check out time was the only real time they dropped the ball was check out time. Check out is noon, not 1pm like listed in the website. We asked for late checkout, which was 1:30. They called us twice in the morning to check out and we had to tell them we had late check out. Felt very rushed and unprofessional. Nearby recommendations- - The Farmers Daughter: great vegan/vegetarian food and fresh pressed juices. - Two Hands: best Australian coffee around the corner - Jack's Wife Frieda: great for brunch and dinner - La Esquina: great foodie Mexican. Mal a reservation and ask to sit downstairs aTLDR: good tub, weird shower, weird cleaning hours, decent food, unreal price/location, good design, complimentary bikes, complimentary wine hour, yoga, comfortable bed, clean, good unfinished rooftop, beware of checkout time.

I think subconsciously I have been putting it off as I haven't wanted anyone else to go there!! I travelled to the Nolitan in September 2013 with my fiance, my sister and her boyfriend. We are all in our late 20's/early 30's. We had stayed in Midtown on previous visits, but wanted to experience a more authentic New York lifestyle this time - away from the more touristy areas. We really like the idea of Chinatown/Little Italy and came across the Nolitan. We love boutique hotels, nice sized and personal, and we were happy to pay a bit extra for what looked like a perfect place. From the minute we arrived, we knew we were going to love it. The weather was fantastic and so we headed straight for the rooftop to enjoy a nice cold afternoon drink. The view from that rooftop is just stunning and instantly, it made the place feel like home. The hotel is conveniently located for the subway, and lots of little bars and restaurants that you wouldnt usually get to visit when staying in the more touristy areas. Staff - amazing, couldnt do enough to help you. The free drinks and nibbles at 6pm were a great touch. Rooms were really decent sized for a NY hotel - everything was beautifully designed, modern and just gorgeous basically! Lovely little touched in the room again - toiletries, slippers etc. The only thing to say is that the hotel is on a busy road and it could be noisy first thing in the morning; it didnt bother us really but if you are a light sleeper, earplugs could be useful. We didnt try the restaurant in the hotel but the bar was fab and was the perfect place for a pre-dinner drink. All in all, one of the nicest hotels I have stayed in - I still cant believe we just stubbled across it. Can't wait to go back.

As a boutique hotel, it knows how to cater to their guests - it is by far the best hospitality and care I've seen in a long time. (I spent many years as a consultant and have stayed in many hotels). The hotel is beautiful with a hip New York feel that is different that many other NYC hotels. It also has a beautiful rooftop! You're also in one of the best neighborhoods in New York, with Bowery, Soho, the Village, Noho, Nolita all right at your fingertips. The food at Cantine Parisenne is delicious, the bar is great, the service wonderful, the rooms are so hip and cool and the best is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. We also hosted our organizations conference at the Nolitan hotel - with approximately 45 guests staying at the hotel. We've received so much praise about the hotel and the experience the hotel was able to provide to our guests. Thank you Nolitan for creating this wonderful space for us and our guests.","New York City, New York","Jennifer P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,5.0

The rooms are quiet, small and functional. I was excited that we had a view of the Chrysler building. We were always greeted warmly by the staff. The location is great if you want a more local experience. It is also close to the subway. Free Wifi but it is an open network. My husband and I had kind of a lot of luggage so the room was just too small. We were able to make it work but we always felt like we were moving luggage around to find things/move in the room.Our stop in NYC was the last of a mutli-city journey. Initially we booked only 2 nights of a 5 night trip. After 2 nights we decided the location was perfect so we would book the remaining 3 there. We booked using a 3rd party site. We went down to the front desk to inform them of the new reservation when someone else called to extend their stay. The front desk quoted them $50 more per night than we paid (nearly $200/night). We liked the hotel but it was really only worth the lower price.","Lucerne, Switzerland","crazybubbas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lucerne, Switzerland</strong>",18,4.0

The same restaurants, the same museums, even the same shows. My wife and I will occasionally book a weekend in the city in hopes of finding something new. Our recent visit to the Nolitan did just that. It renewed our interest in exploring the ever changing and emerging neighborhoods of NYC each with it's own personality. Nolita definitely delivers. The neighborhood is just big enough to provide a weekend of enjoyment while still placing you conveniently next to everything NYC has to offer.Nolita is a great place to eat, shop, and explore and the Nolitan hotel is definitely the place to stay. My wife and I are ridiculous when critiquing places to stay. We have more than once talked ourselves out of a place because of one negative review thinking we'll be the 1 out of 1000 that gets a bad Piña Collada at the Ritz in Grand Cayman. We chose the Nolitan based on some friends who loved it and have to say we did too. Just walking in the door made you feel more hip. It was like hanging with the cool kids in school and it felt downright awesome. It's hip without feeling like a poser. You can sum it up with one word: ""authentic."" It's authentic NYC, authentically hip, has authentic style and makes you feel like part of a creative and exciting neighborhood within manhattan. In the words of Nacho Libre ""let's get down to the nitty gritty."" This hotel is number one clean. I like bright rooms and white bathrooms because you can't hide dirt and these rooms are bright and clean. The bedding was comfortable and the bathroom linens were plentiful. The bathrooms were well stocked which is important because who wants to call the front desk for extra TP (that would kill the hip-ness acquired when you walked in). While industrial chic the rooms were warm and inviting. We did not hear anyone above or around us and we know they were there after meeting them in the elevator. We had a corner view which is almost all windows allowing you to experience the city from the comforts of your room. However, there are privacy curtains so you don't have to share every moment of your life with the world. I did see some reviews about street noise but let's be frank, you're not staying on a farm in North Dakota. You're in NYC. The staff was polite and helpful although we really did not need them for much more than checking in and out. We ate at the restaurant in the hotel which was awesome. We had a chance to meet the chef/owner who was a pleasure and added to the feeling that you belonged. Overall I highly recommend this hotel. Whether you are visiting Nolita for a long weekend or looking for a convenient location in NYC for a long term stay I think you will quickly get comfortable at the Nolitan.","New York City, New York","mmsa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,5.0

I concur with others' remarks about mixed service. Some of the evening staff are brilliant. The day time staff are somewhat friendly, but like another said, robotic, in their attitude. I asked to be upgraded (at my cost) as i was not happy with my room (a small room facing the bridge) and had to ask every day if there was a possibility (no!). It would have been nice if they'd reached out to me at least once in the 8 day stay to let me know the status.As suggested, my room, while comfortable, was nowhere near as lovely and bright as my friends' who faced Manhattan and was sunny and light (same room category). Mine felt dim even though it was on the top floor.It feels petty, but i can't remember the number of times i had to call reception to ask them to refill my fridge of juice. It was odd..very odd, but they just couldn't do it!Also, i ordered pizza from their nearby restaurant service and it took nearly 2 HOURS to arrive!! It was stone cold. How funny when i walked out of the hotel the next morning to realise the restaurant they had to collect the pizza from was literally across the road. Again, countless calls to reception to find out where my pizza was! They were nice about it, but no action. I guess if i could sum up the service it feels somewhat friendly, but quite disingenuous.Other than that, the location is brilliant, the bed is super comfy, the lobby is lovely (and the happy hour is fab!).

They went out of their way at times, to make sure we were happy and well taken care of.The lobby - great selection of books, very warm and comfortable. Good for sitting and people watching. We spent a lot of time looking at the various books, drinking wine and just enjoying the atmosphere.The room - LOVED it. Had a corner room, with a cool tub and great view. The bed was very comfortable. Sunday was bad weather-wise, so we stayed in the room a bit before we ventured out for our show, and dinner, and it was great. I really enjoyed it.The restaurant/bar - had a great cocktail while I was waiting for husband to find a parking space. We did not have the opportunity to eat in the restaurant but the happy hour was excellent. The neighborhood - well, not much bad you can say about the great location and the ease of getting around. There is plenty to walk too, see and do. It was a perfect location!The Cons:I debated if I should even mention anything negative about this property - but I do feel that people should know as much as possible about staying at a place. I have to say, if I had to think about anything negative about the room or hotel itself - it would have been the noise from the heating system. Every time it came on - it woke me up. It is REALLY loud. I don't think there is anything that can be done about it ... you need heat and frankly - as long as I was warm and comfortable, I did not mind too much. But it's LOUD. So much so, that when watching TV or having a conversation, you could not hear anything while it was on. It only stayed on for a short time, long enough to warm up the room and then it shut off, but I could not get used to it. Street noise is expected - and there was that into the night, but I did not mind that since I requested a corner room that is practically all glass. In summary:Overall - it was a bit more expensive than we usually like to spend, but for a nice get-away and a long weekend, it was worth it. I had a very good overall experience at this property, and I am VERY picky about where I stay. The hotel really met my hopes and expectations. I would definitely recommend it and would love to splurge and stay here again sometime.","Alexandria, Virginia","Lisa E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",57,5.0

Went here for a week between Christmas and new Year with my husband and two daughters (20s) for a 60th birthday treat. Customer service was particularly good - I was contacted personally in advance by the reservations manager (Joy) to make sure we had exactly the room we wanted, which was fantastic - ours was 9th floor corner with fabulous views to Williamsburg bridge and Empire State/Chrysler Building etc in each direction and they had arranged for our daughters to stay in the next door room. Joy also booked us into some great restaurants in advance as it was Christmas period and busy. The desk staff were relaxed, very friendly and welcoming, and couldn't do enough to help - one even went and bought me a New York Times for my Sunday breakfast. The rooms are very groovy 'industrial chic' and the bed was supremely comfy. Not huge, but the space is well thought out and wonderfully light with the floor to ceiling windows. The happy hour each evening was a treat, complimentary wine, cheese and biscuits and olives etc. A complimentary bottle of cava to each room on New Year's Eve was a nice touch. The hotel restaurant does good (slightly pricy but huge portions) breakfasts with good coffee. The location was absolutely perfect, within reach of all the funky untouristy downtown stuff in Nolita, boutiques, restaurants, Lower East Side Tenement Museum (a must) and the subway less than 5 mins walk. Perfect. My only very small quibble is that there was piped rock music in the lobby and bar area that was a bit invasive, and wasn't so relaxing at times for hanging out. The volume seemed to vary, though, as did the style. If music was essential (and it seems so these days) they could have had something a little more subtle, ambient and chilled out and in keeping with the alternative feel of the place, rather than mainstream rock (not everyone's taste). . But the rooms were completely quiet, with no neighbouring room noise or street noise at all. Great sleeps!

The location of this boutique hotel is ideal for anyone wanting to experience the real NYC - away from all of the tourist-y areas near Times Square. Situated in the Nolita section of NYC, the neighborhood is what makes this hotel so special. It borders Soho, the Village, Chinatown, and Little Italy, so within an 8 or 10 block radius, you have countless areas to explore with trendy boutiques, great shopping, some of the best restaurants in the city, cafes, bars, you name it - you can find it within a very short walking distance. Some of the negative reviews I read mentioned the size of the rooms and the noise level at the hotel. The rooms are typical NYC-sized rooms, which tend to be on the small side, and you can't stay in the city without expecting some traffic noise, but the beds and linens are super comfortable and the rooms are very modern and industrial chic. There were also nice touches like the huge soaking tub, slippers and robes in the room, and umbrellas that you can use in rainy weather. We found the front desk service at the hotel to be very friendly and helpful, especially Valerie and Sheldon. The hotel offers complimentary wine and cheese in the evening and in nicer weather, you can enjoy this on the amazing rooftop balcony. Unfortunately, it was very cold while we were there, but in nicer weather, I could have stayed on the rooftop for hours! The views are unbelievable - the Empire State Building, Williamsburg Bridge, and the Freedom Tower - an amazing view from every angle! The on-site restaurant, Cantine Parisienne, was great for breakfast or a late night drink - the latte was to die for and everything that we tried was delicious - from the fluffy omelets to the delectable french toast and pastries.

This was not our first visit to NYC and last time we had stayed at The Mondrian. I do feel we are past staying at a hotel that has a nightclub on the roof (Mondrian) but we enjoy a classy ambience with excellent service. The Nolitan exceeded our expectations on many levels. Our room, whilst on the small side was exceptionally well equipped with a stunning view of the Empire State Building and the Williamsburg Bridge. The room had all the luxuries one would expect from a top hotel, the bed was comfortable, we had a freestanding tub and a separate powder room. There was free WIFI in our room as well as in the charming lobby area where we would meet up with family each day. The restaurant and bar provided all necessary drinks and snacks but we also enjoyed the stunning array of dining establishments in the nearby area. The staff were friendly, efficient and charmingly helpful.

Nolita is in a lovely little area...just east of crazy-busy Broadway and SoHo neighborhood. One block from great Italian and Asian restaurants. Excellent boutiques and shops up and down Spring and Prince streets. The rooms are typical small New York style. Are they five-star? No. But, I have stayed in other hotels in New York and I thought this was very clean and modern and worth a four-star rating. During our last visit, we stayed in Chelsea. Yes, we could walk easily to the subway. But, there was no ""neighborhood feel"" like Nolita has. We walked throughout the neighborhood, to the Village, and up and down 6th Ave and Broadway. I loved staying in a hip, bustling neighborhood without the crush of people that you get in other touristy areas of the city. Easy to get the subway uptown, to a play, or to Central Park (or, insane Times Square if you like). I read the mixed reviews about staff. We found them to be very friendly and helpful. The hotel has a fantastic view of the Empire State Building, which was lit up for our Christmas visit. For simplicity's sake, we ate breakfast in the restaurant one morning. It was ok, but expensive like most other hotel restaurants. There are many other great restaurant options within a few blocks.

The hotel is modern and stylish and the rooms whilst small are smart and welcoming. The roof terrace is a great place to watch the sunset with a drink (no bar upstairs but you can take them up from the bar downstairs). The hotel is in a great area with a real neighbourhood feel surrounded by independent bars and cafes. It is really easy to walk to the main sights, particularly lower manhattan. The subway on Spring Street is only five minutes away. The hotel bar is quite good and they do wine and cheese for guests in the afternoon which is a nice touch. The thing that causes the three star review is that we stayed in three different rooms in our five night stay. When we arrived our room type was not available as they had overbooked, but they offered us another room and a free breakfast and a move to the correct room the next day. We were moved in the morning to a room on the top floor however at night a vent next to the room made such a loud noise I had to ask for another room. They managed to turn the fan off for the night and moved us the next day. Whilst I was impressed by the customer service and the final room we ended up in, it was clearly a bit of a hassle.

Usually I'm of the opinion that a hotel is just somewhere to put your head down and I'd rather spend the money on stuff. But my better half doesnt see it that way and I have to admit that how the room is designed and the views of the empire state building and mid-town set the hotel apart. ok , so we love the hotel. We're not rich but are willing to make the sacrifices to be here (ok its no saca-ri-fice, no sacrifice at all) and some things like your better half's approval are as they say are priceless.but I agree about the heating problem. the glass bricks design feature in the outside wall are really poor thermal insulators and the balcony door is almost as bad. the heating has only one fan setting. its noisy and inneffective and you have the choice of a cold hotel room or having a cheap noisy fan blowing lukewarm air into the room. we had it on for an hour and the temperature went from 63 to 65F- we were hoping for 70. you cant sleep with that noise so you wake up freezing. The noise from the road, theres nothing that the hotel can do about that. The other source of noise is the air exhausts on the 8th floor, set into a space between the buildings. what idiot designed that? the noise bounces around that space and amplifies like a noisy car is parked outside the window. these need to be ducted up.there was a problem with the booking which to the hotels credit they did resolve and were very apologetic about the mixup. I was a tad annoyed that I had to ask for a rebate rather than it being offered, as for the first night we got a room with a lower spec than we had paid for, but it didnt spoil my holiday.noise is a real problem for me, other than that excellent.","Bracknell, United Kingdom","linus_atpug</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bracknell, United Kingdom</strong>",47,4.0

I'll start with the good points because unfortunately there are some bad points. Great location; there's so much you can see and do within a 5 or 10 minute walk from the hotel. The hotel is very modern and stylish. We had a balcony room and although it was unseasonably cold, it was still great to sit out and watch the world go by. The hotel has a roof top garden which is quite simply awesome. You get an amazing view of Empire State and in particular World Trade. I imagine this roof top garden would be very busy during the summer for obvious reason though definitely one of the best things about this hotel. The room size is pretty standard for a New York room with a good sized bathroom. There were special little quirks with the hotel that all added to the experience... Down turn service between 5-7pm when you received 2 complimentary chocolates and the weather forecast for the next day. The room also had a Nolitan umbrella which is a nice extra when you forget to bring your own and it's raining outside. Very close to most subway lines if you want to leave the area but honestly, there is so much to do in Little Italy/Nolitan/ Soho. Would highly recommend the Butchers Daughter and the Egg Shop, 2 great cafes beside the hotel. I have given this hotel 3 stars as there are a few negatives... As stated this was booked for our honeymoon. The email correspondence was great before our arrival but when I was booking in, the female receptionist was impersonal and made no reference to our wedding or honeymoon, it was like talking to a robot. I had arranged for a bottle of prosecco to be in the bedroom but this was never produced. These are small points but when you are spending this much on a hotel, you expect the service to be exemplary. The room itself can get very cold as the windows are huge; heating is via the air con system which is very noisy but unfortunately you have no choice when the room is so cold. Each morning I would wake up with a sore throat as I had to have the heating on and the air con system drys the air. Consideration should be given to a better heating system. Although the room size is standard for New York there is still limited storage space. We stayed for a week and we simply had to store our clothes on the table as we only got three small drawers and a small clothes rail that we managed to squeeze about 2 coats and about 4 or 5 other garments on. Also, one evening during the down turn service, a male member of staff walked into the room having knocked then only waited no more than 5 seconds before opening the door. Thankfully I got to the door in time as my wife was getting changed. There was no need for this man to walk into our room. Also, the bedrooms face onto Kenmare Street which is a busy street. The noise levels were fine with us but for first time visitors to New York, they may wish to consider bringing some ear pops as the traffic noise never dies down. I have detailed some negatives but this is a great hotel and simply needs a few areas tweaked. The majority of staff were great and very welcoming, it was just a pity that our first experience of the hotel was with a dispassionate member of staff who didn't seem interested in us at all.",,MrTeddyTedford,12,3.0

This is a great boutique hotel. Super stylish, very clean, amazing service. Be prepared for small rooms and a noisy street outside - some might not like that, but to us that's just part of the experience of visiting NYC. Overall, this is the best hotel experience I've had in New York after about 6 visits here. The location is incredible. Nolita is an awesome neighborhood. You are within walking distance of Soho (which is really, really close) and the Village (a bit further, but still a nice walk). The train to Brooklyn is a block or two away. Little Italy and Chinatown are right there too. The lobby is super cool and the rooms are very modern and fun. The only issues we had - and believe me, they were minor - were the day we left. It was the end of daylight savings and we were supposed to get a wake up call (we were nervous our phones were going to forget about the time change) that we never received. Also, the car service we booked through the hotel was supposed to be all paid up front - we paid at the hotel, and then when the driver dropped us off at the airport he asked, ""so who pays?"" and insisted that we hadn't paid up front with the hotel. And he charged us more than the hotel said the fare was. Turned out to be the driver's fault, but seems like some extra communication is needed between the hotel and the car service. The staff at the hotel reimbursed us immediately and really the only thing we suffered was a few minutes of panic. Overall, it's a great hotel - highly recommended!

Walking distance to subway lines East (6, J/Z), North & South (B, D, F, M) and West (N, R). We reserved the Cityscape Corner Room for a splurge (yes, it is expensive). The first night, however, we had to stay in their Cityscape Room due to plumbing problems in our reserved room. The Cityscape Room is small, but I felt the layout works. Lots of space for your toiletries in the bathroom and I personally did not have a problem with the exposed shower room. Separate water closet (very stark in all white); main sleeping area has exposed concrete with fabric panel as a headboard. Watch out for the sharp corners on the bed platform and floating side tables (those tables are slightly above eye level when you're in bed). The Cityscape Corner Room is accurately illustrated on the hotel website; the oval tub is wonderful and again, we didn't have an issue with the exposed bathroom area concept. We enjoyed the view from the 9th floor (I like the use of the frosted and clear window paneling), and during our stay, we didn't hear any noise from other guests in the hallway. As fellow reviewers have stated, the only item(s) not quiet were the A/C and water closet/bathroom fans--my husband thought the motors were broken and called the front desk for a request for repairs! They are very annoying; fortunately for us, the weather could handle the running of the ceiling fan for ventilation--I pity those who visit The City during the summer and stay at The Nolitan!In any case, a couple of recommendations for the hotel:1) Fix the fans!2) Provide complimentary drinking water for guests; this should be a given with the prices charged.3) Become consistent with your turndown service in the early evening (the hotel additionally provides weather cards and chocolates, but we only received that service twice in 4 nights).4) The on-line concierge service request (a link with the reservation confirmation) was totally ignored (although I didn't need it, I thought I'd test it out and the hotel failed completely).5) Check your credit card bill when you get home; I was charged for items I didn't purchase (probably due to opening the minibar refrigerator to store cheese and olives that I had purchased).Kudos to the wonderful bath products, fluffy towels and friendly front desk folks (thanks Dorina and Kimberly!). The rooms we had were clean, stocked appropriately and electronics worked (i.e., TV, hair dryer). I also appreciated the fact that they supported local artists with artwork (albeit one piece) in the rooms. Note that we didn't access internet service, visit the rooftop bar, take in the complimentary wine and cheese social or eat at the restaurant, so I will not comment on them.Foodies in the immediate area: do have breakfast at The Fiat Cafe on Mott. Very reasonable prices with charming ambiance. Don't forget to walk over to Grand and Essex for The Doughnut Plant and Kossar's Bialys (GREAT Bialys). Pizza at Rubirosa on Mulberry is tasty (very thin crust style); I thought the Russ and Daughter's restaurant was disappointing and expensive--visit their E. Houston street location and purchase take away instead. Don't leave the area without having dinner at Balthazar; a definite ""worth it"" splurge.We visited the Museum of the Moving Image in Astoria, Queens (the famed movie studio is next door). Great place to visit if you love the movies and lots of creative happenings for children on weekends. The Chuck Jones exhibit is currently highlighted--it leaves in January, 2015. Thoroughly loved it!I also recommend taking a sunset cruise on the Hudson via the Adirondack schooner at the Chelsea Piers. It is a lovely way to see Lower Manhattan--plus they serve wine, beer and non-alcoholic beverages on board!

The top-floor suite had no opening windows, and both the A/C and bathroom fans were as loud as motorboats. Most frustrating, however, was the sporadic internet service during my stay. I was traveling for work, and without internet access, a $400 boutique hotel room is no better then a $89 Red Roof Inn. Did I mention the lack of workout facilities? And because they have no in-hotel dining, the hotel's version of room service amounts to the hotel ordering from an outside restaurant for you and adding on their own ""room service surcharge"".

Other reviews set us up to fear the room size, but we ended up in a standard room and found it very comfortable -- we've experienced much smaller in NYC & London and didn't feel at all cramped. We like the industrial edge and found it to be very stylish, but understand that's not for everyone. The bed was the most comfortable I can remember sleeping in (maybe EVER) and our friends, who had a corner room, said the same. For a 'small & trendy' room, the bathroom had a lot of space and plenty of counter top, which I really appreciate. Good heavy curtains keep it dark as long as you want and we didn't get neighbor noise from any direction, including the hall -- though the air conditioning unit was quite loud (louder in 601 than 401, for some reason). It was clean and the finishes and 'accoutrements' were high quality.Other good stuff includes the small bar in the restaurant (Moet & cheese plate while waiting for friends), the 'Sips & Savories' complimentary happy hour, the friendly & accommodating staff, views from the roof (which will be fabulous when / if it is developed into a proper space), the hip & homey lobby, and the location nestled amid great bars & restaurants. The 1pm checkout is a God send, and we always love free, reliable, easy to use WiFi.The bulk of our frustrations stemmed from being downgraded: we booked (and paid in full) for a corner room 6 months before our arrival, but were told at check-in it had been sold to someone else. The Nolitan wanted to make it up to us -- they credited back a chunk of what we'd paid, gave us free breakfasts, a bottle of wine, and many apologies. A bummer, but not the end of the world. The other thing not quite up to snuff is the 'online concierge' that they will email you about if you book. I used the tool to submit preferences and requests twice in advance of our stay, but when I called to follow up neither had been received and, despite submitting the requests a third time over the phone, the little details they claimed to want to take care of (extra pillows, etc) were never seen to. Again, not the end of the world.It's a lovely hotel.

On busy Kenmare Street in Nolita it was close enough to everything - trendy Soho shops, Little Italy, Chinatown and the little streets close by were a perfect setting for wandering around. I didn't eat at the restaurant but there are more than plenty of eateries and cafes to chose from. Plus there's a guide with local businesses who driver to the hotel.My room was a 9th floor cityscape balcony room overlooking Kenmare street. The perfect view of the Empire state and midtown manhattan. I could also see the Williamsburg bridge to the right. I had such a great view that i never closed the curtains at night, instead preferring to soak up the view of the empire state lit up in red, white and blue for labor day. I have to say I could hear the street noise outside, even on the 9th floor, but it wasn't obtrusive and it's New York! It's a lively bustling city. If you're someone who likes total quietness at night then i suggest a higher floor room (pay that bit extra). The room was decent sized, with a toilet separate from the bathroom, although directly across form it so hardly out of the way). There's a peek-a-boo shower but ha a curtain for privacy. Like I said, I'm a solo traveller so this was fine for me.Overall I am so glad I picked the Nolitan Hotel, I was on a 5 day trip and spent 3 days here and then 2 days at a hotel in Midtown but i'd have happily stayed here for the 5 days. I didn't have much dealings with the staff except for check in / check out but they were always friendly when i passed in or out of the hotel. And I suppose you could day if i didn't have any dealings with them then my stay would trouble free.I'd go back here again on my next trip, fingers crossed!!","Stirling, United Kingdom","911angelah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stirling, United Kingdom</strong>",6,5.0

Very Modern. Very Expensive! But that is expected for its location and the quality of rooms! Seems like a completely renovated old property so while the interiors are trendy the layout of the rooms leaves a really bad taste! We had two rooms 601 and 602! One overlooking Kenmore and other overlooking nothing! Very small closet where one couldn't store much! NoSpace for suitcases! Had to open doors to look for the loo! It's on its own away from the sink and shower! And a spa tub on the middle of it all which didn't need to be there except that if it's there the hotel can charge an exorbitant night rate! Not much of a view! Very noisy air conditioning! Could work out the controls! Horrible lighting as had been properly done the room would not have an arty look! Not much of anything really! The keys didn't work and we kept having to go back to the reception! Very smiley staff but irritating!! If one is looking for a place that affords a trendy address then the Nolitan is the best!

The in-house restaurant serving breakfast is convenient, but expensive. I have long hair and the staff immediately placed additional towels in our rooms for me - lovely touch. Staff kindly kept a gift package for a friend at reception after we left, which we really appreciated!!Will definitely stay here again.

Room was clean and well finished. A couple funny things though. The shower had a window that faced the street, so if you got in before the glass fogged up, your body was fair game for the building across the street. No curtain on that window. Also, there was a window between the shower and the room itself. That's fine but the curtain for the shower was controlled from the room, not the shower. Which means your roommates/family could pull the curtain to the side and see you in all your glory. Lastly, if you valet your car, call the number on the ticket yourself. We called the desk as we were walking back to the hotel on a tight timeline, but the hotel staff didn't call the valet service for another 17 minutes. So we got stuck in more rush hour traffic than we would have if we had just called the valet ourselves. Overall, we would still go back to this hotel. Of course we don't have kids who could pull the curtain to the shower to peak. ",,sgumedic,8,4.0

We're both professionals in our late 20's and early 30's (so not Hipsters) and we found that the Nolitan delivered the perfect base in NYC for us. From the incredibly friendly team behind the front desk through to the brilliant 'in-room dining' all of which can be ordered through them and brought to your room (apparently without a charge because you just pay 18% standard gratuity). That was one of many highlights and was so good that one day we just stayed in bed and ordered Chinese for lunch and then a Meatball Pizza for dinner, only venturing out for drinks well into the evening! The rooms have everything in them (including bathrobes), speakers etc. The see through shower which divides the room was fun. Although if you aren't romantic with the person you're sharing with, it probably wouldn't work for you! Either way they sensibly put the toilet in a separate room because unlike some hipster hangouts a dividing screen is not enough and in my humble opinion a big step too far. There was a cool balcony where we drank the complimentary wine/champagne they offer you each night in reception and listened to music while we got ready to hit the town. Overall it was just a very cool experience and perfectly suited to what we were doing in NYC (which was having fun!). As I said the staff were all incredibly friendly people and not 'too cool for school' types. Overall one of the best stays in one of the best parts of Manhattan. We'd definitely come back, maybe even in winter just so we have an excuse not leave the room and order takeout again, great, great pizza area and Chinatown on your doorstep what more could you want?...",Tortola,"OwenP61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tortola</strong>",2,5.0

Rooms are minimally yet very tastefully furnished with a good sized tv, comfy chair and I also opted for a room with a balcony and was lucky to be on the 9th floor with an amazing view including Empire State, midtown etc. simply wonderful. Since Kenmare St can be quite noisy, I do think it is worth requesting a room on a high floor not just due to the views. Room (and rest of hotel) was very clean and it is worth heading to the rooftop too to get the amazing views. Free wifi worked perfectly. Front desk staff were friendly and helpful. It is worth popping to the cheese and wine (5-7 every day I think) as it's a nice way to start the evening. Although there wasn't a great choice of food ( probably because I had been totally spoilt during my first days in the city in another hotel where cheese and wine is also offered), it's definitely a good touch and I know some guests took their drinks up to the roof.

The room had a sexy feel to it with a glass shower open to the room. It also has a curtain and separate wc for the more modest. The room had adequate shelf and cupboard space.

Kenmare is simply an extension of Delancey which leads directly to the Williamsburg Bridge, a beautiful sight all lit up at night.

If traffic noise is a problem or you are a light sleeper, ask for a room on the 7th or 8th floor. The room size for our king was spacious and the bathroom really large by NYC standards.

The hotel does complementary wine, champagne and nibbles between 5-7pm, they have cruiser bikes for guests to use and the doorman is a nice touch for such a small hotel. One note, they do not have water so BYO. Whole foods is a 5 minute walk but you have to pass the Bowery men's shelter to get there which can be a tad seedy after 6pm.

In our room the toilet was in one room, and the sink and shower in another. The shower had a glass window looking out to the bedroom, presumably so you can see the view out the window while you shower. There is a curtain that can be drawn for shy folks. The ceiling in the toilet and bathroom are left bare concrete as though to show what's been done to the rooms. We had a balcony where we could get some New York air if we wanted. The room was nicely air conditioned or heated as the weather warranted. There was a bar and closets with umbrellas, iron, and hair dryer.

My trip to New York was designed to be the trip of a lifetime. What I didn't count on was that the Nolitan would be such a cornerstone of such an amazing trip. The perfect location just on the edge of the village meant that evening strolls, morning brunches and brilliant little shops were the order of the lazy days when you felt lazy. Or the proximity to the bustling city meant that within a few blocks you were right in the heart of the noise and excitement. The staff were excellent yet barley noticeable. My room was simply amazing - I could look out to the Empire State building from my SHOWER ! Every morning I had intended to nip out and get a different breakfast, however after day one and my main man Carlos looking after me I sat in and had breakfast the in great little restaurant every day, watching the traffic drift by and enjoying the low winter sun. Then I would take a coffee up to the roof top terrace, soak in NY city, then go out for the day. Every night was an absolute pleasure coming back to the Nolitan. Whether it was to crash out on the bed (after checking the forecast card on my pillow every night) of relax with a drink in the bar. The mood, the vibe and the general atmosphere at the Nolitan hypnotically soothes you and just puts you in a fantastic frame of mind. No wonder this place has such great reviews. Like nearly everyone who has stayed here I was reluctant to leave. What should have been the trip of a lifetime actually has become a quest.......how can I get back to NY and how can I get back to the Nolitan.

Sure, NYC is one noisy city, and the constant outside noise does seep in through the double glazing, but that's just part of being in Manhattan. If you're bothered by horns, traffic, sirens etc, I'd say go for a room on one of the top floors without a balcony (you'll also get the views over Manhattan to the Empire State from there). We tried both rooms with, and without balconies, and although the balcony is fun, it does give you a little less room space and it's a tad noisier. Anyway, the roof terrace is a fab spot for taking in the panoramic Manhattan skyline, so no need for a balcony really.The rooms are cleverly designed in a sleek, minimalist style with lots of concrete, white paint, muted tones and glass. The generous sized shower and separate toilet are nicely integrated into the room design. Air con is a bit noisy (a couple of other guests complained to us about that) but we only needed to use the overhead fan, so no problem for us. Overall, the staff were fabulous, and just on the right side of chatty while maintaining a high level of professionalism.The hotel also offers a free cocktail hour between 5-7pm in the foyer which is a great way to meet other guests and chat with the friendly and helpful staff. You can also grab your drink and some snacks and head up to the roof terrace which was never busy.The best recommendation I can give is that when we're next in Manhattan, we'll stay at the Nolitan.","Melbourne, Australia","David M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",3,5.0

I got a balcony room at Nolitan because I wanted to have a bit more space and a reasonably view in a fun part of town without breaking the bank. I definitely got that. The rooms are small but were laid out so that everything was functionally usable and the separate WC is a huge win. The balcony itself was very tiny although it had a fun view. But the real reason to get it is that those rooms are slightly larger and if we'd had a smaller room it would have been harder to move around by far. The staff at the Nolitan were very helpful and friendly. They handled normal requests and special requests in general but there were a couple of oddities in the service (the paper we asked for wasn't delivered the first couple days, the pillows that we asked for were delivered on first ask, and turn down service only happened some nights). With a bit of additional organization the staff could easily provide an outstanding experience because these were exceptions to their great service and I assume were simply oversights. The location here is fantastic - Nolita is a really fun neighborhood and I'd say it was our favorite for walking around. Our next favorites (east village and west village) were not far at all and overall I felt like we had great access to great restaurants. It will take you an average of 20 - 25 minutes to get up to the major attractions like central park, theaters, etc. But it was worth it to stay in such a fun area. Please note that this is a hotel with a modern look - if you want traditional notions of luxury you won't find them here.

The somewhat gritty, trendy and rapidly gentrifying Lower East Side definitely qualified as such. Seeing as the Nolitan borders NoLIta/SoHo and the LES, I figured the hotel would make an excellent gateway to this section of the city. And I was right. Like most things in New York, so many things were within walking distance of the hotel. Not to mention that it's a quick walk to either the Bowery Station (J,Z trains) or the Spring Street Station (6 train) to ride the subway to all points up and down Manhattan. The hotel itself is gorgeous from the outside. It's a fairly new hotel, and the architecture stands out in contrast to its neighbors. The hotel lobby is very simple and modern and lends itself well to the rest of exterior and to the rooms. Now the rooms are definitely cozy. For anyone that is visiting New York for the first time, a room like this would be a shock to your system. But seeing how it's New York, rooms of such small size are more common than not. Even with myself just traveling alone, it was a little of an adjustment for someone with a fairly large suitcase. That being said, the rooms are very functional, and designed well with somewhat of an industrial feel to it. The bed was very comfortable and the overall cleanliness of the room was superb. The coolest part of my room by far was the bathroom. The bathroom is very good size considering the overall size of the room. A completely glass wall separated the shower from the bed, which means you can see into the shower from the bed, and vice versa. I could definitely see how that would be a perk for couples. I made sure I chose a room with a balcony (whenever I can get one for not that much more money in the city, I go for it!), which overlooked Kenmare Street. Kenmare is a pretty busy street since it leads up to Delancey Street and the Williamsburg Bridge. Even considering that though, the room was fairly quiet and getting a sound sleep was not a problem at all. If you do stay at the hotel, definitely head up to the rooftop to get an amazing view of the financial district and of the Williamsburg bridge. As far as eats, the sky is the limit. After all, you're right next to Little Italy and only a block away from Lombardi's Pizza! If you choose to dine in at Cantine Parisienne, in the front corner of the hotel, you will not be disappointed. Excellent quality at very reasonable prices. And if I ever needed to make a quick run to the store for snacks/toiletries, there's a Duane Reade right next to the Spring St. subway station. Overall, I felt that this was an excellent stay. For a couple heading to the city for the weekend for a quick getaway or someone on business looking to explore the up and coming neighborhood of NoLIta, I would highly recommend this hotel. I probably wouldn't recommend it for families or for people visiting the city for the first time. There are cheaper and more attraction accessible options.","Fair Oaks, California","Mike P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fair Oaks, California</strong>",4,4.0

It's styling may not be to everyone's tastes and will probably date in less than a decade but right now the minimilism, and mix of industrial materials with more traditional has a style which is fashionable and looks the part. On the whole I liked but couldn't help wonder whether the fashion for bare concrete ceilings in the bedroom suited the hotelier's pockets more than it did me.I had Cityscape Balcony Room (7th floor) and found it quite spacious and very clean. The open plan arrangement makes best use of the space and although having the toilet and bathroom on either side of the entry may bother some it didn't bother me. I imagine many people don't use the balcony, which is only about 3ft wide with a bench, but I enjoyed rested up with a beer after a hard days sightseeing, watching the bustle below. Having paid extra to be on floors 7-9 the promised view was a little disappointing. I suspect you really need to be on 8 or 9. It was also a shame that a 3/4 of the window was semi-opaque as well - if I wanted privacy I could close the curtain. However, the roof is amazing with near 360 view including Empire State and WTC tower one. The bed was probably the best I've slept in at a hotel, although Kenmare Street is quite busy and I wouldn't have wanted to be on one of the lower floors. On the seventh, it was just about OK but light sleepers might near ear plugs.Location is excellent. Little Italy, China Town and Nolita are virtually on your doorstep. Access to the rest of Manhattan is easy with three metro lines just a few blocks away. Bowery Street, one block away provides a link to JFK and parts of downtown though not much else (I never used it).

On the positive side, the rooms are nice and spacious, look very slick and are comfortable. This is a big plus. On the downside, there was a live band in the restaurant on the Sunday night we stayed. The band played music very loud and was going until after midnight. The band also kicked off again in the early hours of the morning. This kept us awake. We were then awake at 5.30am in the morning with loud music being played throughout the hotel. We had to ask staff to turn the music down as most people like to sleep at 5.30am. The internet was patchy and kept kicking us off wifi. We had to ask the staff to reset the system. This was particularly frustrating as my partner and I were using the system to enter information which we had to repeatedly re-enter due to the problems with the internet. When checking out and leaving the hotel, there was no offer of assistance with flagging down a cab. So consequently, we decided not to tip the staff downstairs.

We were very happy with our choice for several reasons. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. There was always someone at the desk to answer questions or help with suggestions. The atmosphere was hip and young and professional. The room was spotless, very modern and the beds were great! Trouble getting out of them in the morning! Because of circumstances we ended up needing a cot in our city scape room and even then it was roomy enough. The bathroom was large with a good shower. While the air conditioner unit was noisy it was a constant thing and we didn't notice it. For two this room would have been very comfortable. The rooftop was a great spot. What an incredible view! and the happy hour bubbly and snacks were a nice break after busy days. We didn't eat in the hotel so can't comment on that. Nolita itself was wonderful. It reminded me of Europe. We walked everywhere and found everything from a sports bar for the hockey game to Karyokee to wonderful cafe's and wine bars, restaurant, shopping....

I loved the feel of the rooms and the hotel itself. The rooftop deck was really great. It was such a fun way to see the city. It was close to a ton of great restaurants/bars as well as shopping.However, I don't think I'll stay again. This is mainly due to the hotel's location. When I booked a room, I saw that there was a subway station about a block away. I didn't think about checking which subway line ran through the area. It was the J which will only take you further downtown or into Brooklyn. If you wanted to go uptown (to see a show, central park, museums, 'touristy' places) you had to walk about 4 blocks. This wasn't terrible, it just wasn't completely convenient. I actually ended up just taking a cab home from midtown most nights (about a $14 ride). It's on a busy street. Even on the 9th floor with the windows shut we still heard traffic all night. That happens in most places in New York. Finally, the room we had initially booked was flooded. So we had to downgrade. The hotel gave us a free bottle of champagne. That was nice, but I feel like when I've had similar things happen at other hotels I was comped for a night or was given a free meal at the hotel restaurant. Obviously the situation was unavoidable for them -I don't fault them for having a flooded room - but I was disappointed about not getting the room I had booked.If you're looking for an interesting and different neighborhood, I would definitely suggest this hotel. I'll probably stick to a place that is a bit more convenient for getting to all of Manhattan.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","Sharkalark</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",151,3.0

The hotel is cool but in an unpretentious way, the lobby is excellent, modern, full of books and newspapers and place you feel comfortable hanging out in.The rooms were compact, but very modern and well designed, there was lots of natural light. I was on the third floor and had no issues with the street noise, they must have triple glazed the windows as the room was very quiet. There was a full mini-bar as well.I didn't use the restaurant.So there is no room service as such instead they have menus from restaurants around the areas so you make a call and the food comes directly from the restaurant of your choice and there were about 20 restaurants to chose from....I didn't use it because hey its New York so its not like there is a short supply of eating options in the city. But still an excellent idea.The only negatives were the fans in the toilet and the bathroom, plus the heater seemed exceptionally loud, they all worked perfectly but very loud. Also another minor point is that there was construction happening in the hotel during the day, it would have been nice to be told on check in as is usually the case with exceptional hotels...also the gym is 5 blocks away which is a bit inconvenient, especially if the weather is not so great......still these are very minor, picky faults with a very very nice hotel.The price as well was very reasonable considering it was the Easter weekend and the cities reputation for expensive accommodation.Highly recommended.","Paris, France","superpang</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",48,4.0

Concierge was super helpful in helping me track down a particular store (Raleigh Denim, 5 minutes walk away) as well as giving me eating options outside of the hotel (the French Brasserie is very good however, get the club sandwich), and the whole experience was one of the better ones I've had in New York.

Usually I'm on business but this was a short vacation in the city and the first time my wife had accompanied me. For business I've stayed in the front facing cityscape and neighbourhood rooms - all have been great. However as it was a vacation and there were two of us we wanted more space and loved the idea of the suite on the 8th floor. You get three distinct areas; bedroom, living room and bathroom but the hotel's kept it pretty open plan so it feels spacious - especially by NYC standards. You also benefit from the floor to ceiling windows (some of which are opaque - allowing the light through but offering privacy). There's a great free standing bath in the middle of the suite which affords fantastic views of the city skyline including the Empire State building. The staff are incredibly welcoming and create a relaxed atmosphere which is best experienced in the lobby living room where the hotel has a complimentary wine and cheese reception every day between 5-7. It was a good chance to meet some of the staff and other guests - we got a few good dinner/lunch recommendations for some of the neighbourhood restaurants.In terms of location the hotel's worked well for business and this trip proved it works equally well for sightseeing. Both Spring St and Bowery subway stations are only a few minutes walk from the hotel and offer pretty good connections. We made it down to Wall St in 15 minutes and from there it's a short walk to Battery Park for the Statue of Liberty. Getting up town (especially East side) to the museum's is pretty straight forward from Spring St. And for shopping we literally strolled into SoHo.The Nolitan's in house restaurant was buzzing on each of our 4 nights - we can testify that the food, cocktails and wine were all up to scratch; the staff were helpful and knowledgeable about what was on offer. We also noticed that many of the guests appeared to be from outside the hotel which helped to remove the sterile feeling that often accompanies many hotel restaurants.What could have been better? Two more days to chill and better weather!

My partner and I were looking for something pretty central with enough to keep us occupied indoors if the weather got bad. The Nolitan might be small but it is just a sensational place to stay, and it ticked all the boxes for us.Our arrival was smoothly handled by Dhillon and the rest of the reception staff, all of whom were young, friendly, professional and helpful without descending into over-casual or over-familiar. A good balance. We managed to arrive at happy hour and chilled glasses of bubbly were pressed into our hands as we checked in.Our room was pretty small – I’ve only seen smaller in Japan – but beautifully appointed and with little touches like excellent quality toiletries and red slippers and robes and plenty of storage and hanging space and good lighting. We didn't have a kettle in the room (being serious tea drinkers a kettle is essential for us) but one call to reception got us a very stylish kettle (of course) and some mugs. So just ask!We had a perfect view of the uptown skyline including the Empire State Building decked out in its red and green Christmas colours – ask for a north-facing room on a high floor. We didn’t have a balcony – some rooms do and some don’t. The balconies are tiny in any case, but in warmer weather it might be nice to ask for one.As mentioned, happy hour starts around 6pm until 8pm and you can chill out in the leather seats at reception quaffing really rather decent red, white and sparkling wine and nibbling on cheese and crackers and nuts. A nice time to relax before heading on out for a busy night in the Village.Wifi is free and the signal is strong in the rooms and at reception.As mentioned before, the staff were all great and couldn’t do enough for us. There is a restaurant on site but we didn’t eat there, just had a drink at the bar. You can borrow a PlayStation if you want to stay in, or a skateboard if you want to get around the neighbourhood a little more quickly. There are countless great places to eat and drink nearby – just walk out the door and into whatever place takes your fancy. They’re all great. But don’t miss the Bowery Diner just a couple of blocks away on Bowery Street. A sensational modern diner – and the bloody Marys and mimosas at breakfast are a great pick-me-up after a heavy night.Can’t imagine staying anywhere else in New York when we come back again next year. Oh –and don’t miss the rooftop terrace with 360 degree views of the best skyline in the world!",Melbourne,"Mairead D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",47,5.0

Just be advised that there are some differences with this property that you might want to know about ahead of time. This is a good hotel. Not great, not bad. You must know that the rooms are very small, and the HVAC system is loud (fan noise). On the plus side, you can often find a good price if you are flexible, it is a clean hotel, it seems safe, and it is well located.Review: I was attracted to the Nolitan, oddly, because the Butcher’s Daughter restaurant is located across the street. It is a good find, and I might stay at the Nolitan again.As to the negative, the first is that the rooms are very, very small. The hallways are exceptionally narrow and dark. Or, I should say, lightly lit. When the fan for the HVAC comes on in your room, it is loud. I actually never did get a good night’s sleep because several times an hour, the blower came on and awakened me. Ear plugs helped a bit.The Nolitan can be pricey, but if you are flexible, you can find a reasonable price. It is never inexpensive.Here are the plusses: a comfortable lobby, there are some excellent staff members that work the front desk, WIFI is available at no extra cost, it is located nicely to access fun neighborhoods like Nolita and SoHo, and also to access lots of fun restaurants (try Butcher’s Daughter, Taim, Rubirosa, Hampton Chutney, Baltazar, etc.). I love that it is very clean. I always felt comfortable at the Nolitan.I wish Trip Advisor would allow fractions on its star rating. If it would, I’d give the Nolitan Hotel 3.5 stars.","Manhattan, Kansas","fidelrobert</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manhattan, Kansas</strong>",96,3.0

When the city was hit with a snow storm impacting travel the staff was helpful in providing information on how to get around the city and options for airport transportation. Beyond the customer service the rooms were well decorated, impeccably clean, and the amenities were unique and befitting of the area of town the hotel is located in.All I can say is that I'll definitely be back, we had a wonderful stay filled with great memories.","Seattle, Washington","Lauren R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",4,5.0

Location is very nice, many nice restaurants and breakfastplaces within walking distance; same goes for shopping areas and subway stations.Why only an average rating, you may ask. Well, because the other hotels in the direct neighborhood have the same advantages as the Nolitan of course and you should rate primarily on the merits of the hotel itself. Perks: they have 4 bicycles you can use free of charge and everyday except on sunday they have a ""happy hour"" with wine and snacks. Service is good and friendly.Problems: rooms are tiny and the airconditioning makes a hell of a lot of noise. Everytime it turned on at night it literally woke me up. This was particularly annoying, since I'm from Europe and due to jetlag I cherish every hour of sleep I can get when I'm in NYC. All the front desk could do for me was hand me a pair of earplugs; apparently this problem can't be solved which is a real pity. The prices they charge are such that I think I can do better elsewhere.Another thing is that while the temperature is comfortable in the rooms, the hallways and elevators are freezing cold in winter.

I have absolutely no complaints about any of the actual features of the hotel they were just fantastic. The issue with my stay arose with the continental breakfast - very average selection to say the least, regardless we had it anyway as it was included in the package - or so we thought. After asking staff whether we had to pay extra for other things or was that all included in the free continental breakfast, we were met with the response it would be extra, so we stuck with the continental. Upon leaving we went to pay for the coffees that we had to find that the whole breakfast had been billed...... This was queried and following a quick check on my mobile phone, the website for the hotel clearly stated 'Free perks included: continental breakfast' Following pointing this out to the staff at the front desk they contested that because my booking didn't state it had a breakfast option it was chargable? What happened to the customer is always right. They even had the cheek to print out my booking and point to the fact it wasn't listed there. The fact is it was listed on their website as clear as day and should have been honoured. After spending nearly $2000 on a stay in their hotel surely they would comp a $20 bill which was because of their misleading advertising? It took the duration of my stay of arguing with them and it wasn't until they then billed me again for another breakfast which i didn't even have they refunded me the amount. Absolutely unacceptable behaviour from someone in the service industry and it would definitely put me off staying here again if they treat their paying customers like this, regardless of how nice the actual place is.","Norwich, United Kingdom","Blainey77c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norwich, United Kingdom</strong>",20,3.0

On reflecting our four nights in each area, this hotel and location was our definite preference. The hotel is clean and the staff are amazingly friendly and obliging. Our room was a corner room on the 7th floor and it had an amazing view of the empire State building, lit up at night in Christmas colours. The room had large windows, some frosted and some clear and the room felt very private - we didn't feel the need to close the curtains at night, preferring instead to absorb the New York/Nolita night life below. The bed was comfortable, the toiletries lovely and the bathroom area, with a separte bath open to the rest of the room felt indulgent. The area is amazing and you feel removed from the overly touristy areas of New York and instead you are surrounded by boutiques, restaurants and cafes in the Nolita area, contrasted by the action packed ares of Chinatown and Little Italy a short walk away. We enjoyed just walking and taking in the the local area and there is easy access to uptown Manhattan via the Spring Street underground station, a short walk away.There are some amazing restaurants and cafes nearby. We enjoyed breakfast twice at The Butcher's Daughter across the road and had a great dinner at 'Public' - a Michelin star restaurnt a short walk away.

It's in an interesting location at the intersection of Soho, Chinatown and Little Italy. You can see elements of all three neighborhoods the moment you step out. Turn one way and there's the Italian pizza and pasta place, turn another and shop signs are in Chinese. And it's very well located for shopping at SOHO, which is barely a five minute walk away, just past the really convenient Spring Street subway station on the number 7 line. The line is great for the east side of Manhattan, taking you directly to shopping areas like Fifth and Madison, within easy walking distance of places like Bergdorf's and Barney's, though I would stick with Soho for variety and a better range of prices.The line is also very convenient to museum mile on the east side of Central Park, and you can get to the Met, Whitney, Frick etc without switching trains. There's also a really useful Citibikenyc rental station just off the Spring Street subway which is great if you want to cycle. And the hotel provides it's own bikes if you prefer.The hotel's rooms are smallish, and on the slightly expensive side compared to what you would get in other cities. But that's common in NYC, and they are very well designed to look bigger than they actually are, as there is a glass wall between the bathroom shower area and the rest of room looking toward the windows. This opens up the room considerably in a visual sense. (Don't worry there are dark curtains at the shower glass wall for complete privacy if you so desire.)The room was kept spotless all the time and even when I looked closely at the shower area, there were zero stains or dirt. For a germaphobe like me, this was important. I didn't find the room I was in on the 7th floor noisy at all, as some other reviewers had warned.The toiletries provided were also pretty good, being the same brand and range that I got in the Mandarin Oriental in Barcelona.While breakfast wasn't provided I found the pricing of the hotel's in-house restaurant reasonable and the quality quite respectable. The wait staff were friendly and efficient. The lobby was nice and there were always people sitting around reading on the sofas which is great if you would like to socialise a bit.I have to say that the hotel's staff lived up to their claims of friendliness. They were friendly and helpful to a fault. I requested tickets to a broadway show and a cruise around the city before I had even left Singapore, and they were waiting for me when I arrived, as promised. One thing I found really interesting about the hotel staff was their diversity. There were receptionists and staff of Chinese, Hispanic, Sri Lankan, White, and Black descent. I also thought Torge, who was Tibetan, was really helpful (and kinda hot!) I thought this was a great reflection of NYC itself , with it's diversity and tolerance.Some advice: There did not seem to be any difference in the internal layout and size of the rooms with and without balconies. So if you don't need the balcony, it's cheaper to just go with the standard room. There is enough light as the windows are sufficiently large. The hotel gives an access pass to a nearby public gym. It's a big gym sprawling over three levels. But if you don't like walking please note that it's a 10 minute or more walk away, which isn't great in the winter. Also, at peak periods there aren't enough lockers at the gym with combination locks, so if you are going there just after working hours, make sure to bring yr own padlock. The gym itself is very well equipped and the staff friendly and welcoming.In all, I had a very enjoyable and restful time at the Nolitan.","Singapore, Singapore","BertSingapore</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",27,5.0

Since this hotel is still relatively new, the prices are quite reasonable for what you get. The Nolitan is a design hotel. Rooms are a clean modern design but warm using a combination of wood (floors), concrete (ceilings and wall sections) and glass. The location is excellent, just on the border of Nolita ans SoHo and a five minute walk to several subway lines. The staff were EXCELLENT during our stay. The youthful front desk staff were knowledgeable about the area and eager to help and please. Clearly this is important to the management both in hiring practices and training.Upon arrival on day one, we were checked in early and the staff recommended some local restaurants that offer 15% discount if you are staying at the Nolitan. We ate at the Ken&Cook across the street which was amazing and very reasonably priced. for breakfast we hit a tiny little deli diagonally across the street called Fiat Cafe (small, owner run and cash only) which was great.Bathroom shower was nice although strangely in front of a window facing the street (don't worry, equipped with a pull down blind of course).

We stayed in an 8th floor cityscape king room during the week of Thanksgiving, and the view was incredible. The rooftop terrace offers gorgeous views of uptown and downtown. I would like to stay there again during warmer weather and enjoy it more. We really loved the comfort and design of the room, which was not too small by NY standards. The bed was super comfy, everything was clean, and the little amenities such as robes and slippers, umbrellas to borrow, and good quality toiletries were nice. The glass shower in the middle of the room is kinda fun, especially because if you leave the curtain open, you can enjoy a view of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings from the shower. A unique experience! The location was perfect for the places we wanted to be near, and it's a short walk to the F train, or the NR or 6 trains in the other direction.

The hotel is near a busy junction and New York drivers are madly in love with their horns. They blast them constantly if they think someone is slow, in their way and the list goes on. The first night was impossible and be aware the traffic never stops in 24 hours. We got earplugs which I hate and even they did not block it completely. The next issue is internet connection. Despite checking with the hotel before booking as we needed it for work and calls it hardly worked. Many calls to the desk to get it reset gave you a 50% chance but even when it worked it was so slow it drove you mad. Others complained or sat in the lobby to connect.

Unless you are subway-phobic or believe Manhattan is limited to midtown, I highly recommend this location, sandwiched between Soho and the Lower East Side, just north of Little Italy and Chinatown. The rooftop view is unrestricted by nearby buildings, and provides some of the best views - both uptown and downtown - that I have seen in any hotel.I was provided a hassle-free, early check-in to a room on the sixth floor. This was much appreciated after coming in on an overnight flight. One of the former reviews suggested that this hotel has all of the ambiance of a hip, boutique hotel, but without a hint of the stuffy attitude that seem to be part of these hotels - and I fully agree.I'll leave the room descriptions to the other reviewers and oyster.com - other than to say that the room was clean, well appointed and comfortable. I am giving four stars for the fitness center - even though there is none located in the hotel - because the passes to the 24 Hour Fitness in Soho, while convenient on a rainy day, is a plus.The only potential negative is that the hotel is close to an intersection that inspires a great deal of horn honking in the late evening. If this bothers you, you should be looking for a hotel in the countryside. For me, a relatively deep sleeper, this was a positive reminder that I was in electrifying NYC, and not on a camping trip.Thanks to the Nolitan and its staff for a great weekend!","Sausalito, California","CaptainOver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sausalito, California</strong>",15,5.0

After a very long day of travelling, I arrived at the Nolitan hotel late in the evening. I was met by a very nice lady at the front desk who was very polite, professional and informative. The hotel lobby itself is very welcoming, warm and has a great atmosphere when there are people there. We were given our two room keys and we went to our room (601). The room was immaculately clean, the furnishing very trendy and the bed was very inviting. The bathroom was clever, using windows and light to create more space. We were hungry and given a few places to go and even offered room service from one of the many restaurants around Nolita. The hotel was more of a base as we were exploring NYC for the week but it was always a pleasure being there. The rooftop terrace, the Cantine Parissien, the complimentary wine and nibbles in the evening and the superb staff all led to us having a fantastic time. And to top it all off we were going to go to a plain boring 3* hotel in Times Square for almost £1000 more for the week however we took a chance on this new hotel and ending up striking it lucky. I genuinely can't recommend this hotel enough for a young couple going to New York. It's not the poshest place, it doesn't pretend to be. It is relaxed, clean, trendy and affordable with good size rooms. Don't be a sheep and go to Times Square, it is gaudy and not much there.

The Nolitan seemed an ideal location in the heart of the surrounding areas of Soho, Little Italy, Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side. Upon arrival the staff were immediately friendly and accommodating offering extras such as bike hire, 'happy hour' (complimentary cheese and wine of an evening) and even down to what time we preferred our room to be serviced. The reception area was cosy with modern decoration but ample seating for guests to enjoy their wine of an evening.The room itself (a Neighbourhood room) was compact but very contemporary with great attention to detail. The 5th floor room had a great view onto Kenmare Street, and noise was minimum of an evening taking into account you are staying in Manhattan. What makes the Nolitan a unique hotel within the area is the rooftop, located on the eleventh floor. We were taken aback with the unspoilt views Uptown (of Empire State), the Williamsburg Bridge and the Financial District. I cannot stress enough how much more special it makes the trip and because of its locations you see so much more than you would in a top floor hotel within Midtown. We stayed for ten days so although we were busy exploring we also wanted a comfortable hotel we could unwind in and recharge our batteries. The Nolitan is perfect for this and the rooftop was ideal for relaxing (you can take your complimentary wine up there, or order a drink from the adjacent restaurant earlier/later in the day). One thing that surprised us was the lack of facilities to be able to make a cup of coffee or tea in the room. The mini bar was full with alcoholic beverages, snacks etc. but when you want a coffee to wake you up, you have to get dressed and head down to the restaurant. It was mentioned on check in that we would be able to phone down and request coffee to our home, but when we did this on the third day we were advised we needed to come down ourselves. It was a minor thing and did not tarnish our stay, but were surprised it was not available in the room.As all the other reviews on here testify, the Nolitan is a hotel like no other in Manhattan.

There were some great little touches, we loved the bicycles that were free to take out. This is honestly the BEST way to see the city, and the Nolitan provided cute little bikes and locks for free!

Rooms in NYC are notoriously small, but the small details at the Nolitan, like the drawers under the bed, narrow desks, glass shower cubicle, floor to ceiling windows, slim furniture, and very minimalistic design, gave the rooms an airy feeling and the impression of a room larger than it actually was.

Staff was really friendly, relaxed and very accommodating, suggested to take the wine and cheese to the rooftop, picked up pizzas for us one evening, all in all a very ""complete"" experience.The location is very good, 5-10 min. to SoHo, Chinatown, Little Italy and Subway stations. There is a 24/7 Duane Reed and a Wholefoods Market close by, and a lot of small quirky shops, cafes, bars and restaurants in the streets surrounding the hotel, very ""local and cosy"" feeling.The rooftop is a great asset for this hotel and although it is probably going to be really nice when they get a bar going up there, it was nice to have the rooftop almost like your own private terrace.As others have mentioned, Kenmare street is not a quiet street, NYC has traffic everywhere and I usually do not mind some street noise, but here we are talking about huge trucks passing by and some of them delivering goods in the early morning for some food whole seller across the street. That said, I suspect that the main problem is the door to the small balcony, since the corner room we also had (on the same floor) was very quiet.Once again, thanks to The Nolitan and all the staff for a wonderful stay in NYC.","Brussels, Belgium","Ole L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brussels, Belgium</strong>",69,5.0

It has everything you could want in a hotel. The decor is minimal and modern, and many of the rooms have balconies. The rooftop is amazing and open to all of the guests. The staff is so friendly and welcoming that you almost do a double take and wonder if you actually are still in NY. They welcomed me back the last time I stayed with them like they missed me. It was really sweet. We brought our niece to NY as a graduation present.Joy, from the Nolitan, called a few days beforehand to ask if there was anything else we needed before we arrived. Its small personal touches like that which really elevate the Nolitan above many other hotels. We stayed in the Nolitan Suite, which was on the 8th floor and had a great floor to ceiling view of the Williamsburg Bridge. The room was very spacious and the couch pulled out into a sofa bed which they set up for our niece that night during turndown while we were out. They have bikes that you can rent for free from them and take a tour of the city. Its located a few blocks from the subway which will take you wherever youd like. The Lower East Side, The East Village and Soho are all right there on your door step. And at the end of the day, you get to come back to The Nolitan, which has one of the most comfortable beds I've ever encountered. I never count down the days until i can sleep on my tempurpedic at home. The bedding itself is luxurious and soft. The rooms are an average size for NYC. I would rent the suite every time i came to NYC but as I am not independently wealthy, I will stick with a cityscape balcony, which is totally affordable. All in all, theres no downside to the Nolitan, I just wish they had a Nolitan every place I visited.","Alameda, California","Jimmatysik</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alameda, California</strong>",3,5.0

Could not have asked for a more knowledgeable, thoughtful and hospitable staff and front desk. The wine happy hours were nicely done. Hot nights and hotter days, so going up to the roof w/ a complimentary glass of wine @ about 6p.m. just hit the spot. The roof is ""raw"" (unimproved) but very appealing- great, perhaps spectacular views, comfortable seating w/ tables, and a great chance to meet other hotel guests...or not depending on your preference. Just a very comfortable space, without being highly designed or decorated.It is a treasure.Our room itself was very clean-small but fine with a nice design element. We had a balcony. I loved the look but I felt unwilling to venture out on it by the height and narrowness. My companion was fine with it. The roof didn't bother me in the least but that balcony.... The room layout was a bit odd, but it seemed to make sense. In the room the toilet was on one side of the internal hall and the sink and shower on the other. Nice fixtures with good water pressure. A yoga mat reclines in the closet. I didn't use it, but it made me feel virtuous everytime I saw it. With all the tasty food available within a very short walk from the hotel, feeling virtuous was good.We had no issues w/ the noise level. We had the a/c on, so maybe that masked it sufficiently. The halls could be a bit noisy when people were coming and going.Location, location, location. Great, in that you can get there from here. Lots of walking adventures, Little Italy, Chinatown and Soho. Shops of all stripes, restaurants galore and the subway is convenient. One downside about the location- for some reason it is really hard to grab a cab right by the hotel.In sum, we enjoyed our stay, thought it was a decent value for the money, has a great staff, a nice vibe and would go back. A great place to put up your feet at the end of the day and a good place to start from the next day.","New York, New York, United States","Lisa M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, New York, United States</strong>",1,4.0

The hotel is what you would expect of a boutique: unique, service oriented in a genuine way, leading edge. The team was great across the board, especially James -- who was hugely tuned in and willing to make your trip memorable.The wine and cheese at 5pm is nice, but pretty basic. Once they get the roof top patio in full swing, it will be even more compelling.

It was my first time staying in this area and the hotel really is in tune with what is a great place to base yourself for a visit. I have tended to stay in the Meatpacking District but having stayed here I think my next trip will bring me back to the Nolitan. The hotel is surrounded by bars, restaurants, cafes and quirky shops (from furniture to jewellery makers to music stores) that work beside businesses in a way that feels more lived in. The atmosphere is very engaging (the afternoon complementary wine reception in the hotel lobby, which while modern in design, has a feel of a library to it with bookshelves and a sunken seating area is a nice idea). Free use of iPads, bicycles and skateboards you may not necessarily make use of but underline the feeling from staff that there is a genuine interest that you enjoy your stay. We were in town visiting friends so ate out every night so while the attached brasserie and bar looked nice we didn't try it out. The rooms are very modern in design but make good use of space and the toilet is seperated from the bathroom. It was large enough, with the balcony, to spend some time in. Our room was on a higher floor with a small balcony, I would book a higher floor again due to the traffic noise. There was no problem of sound when we were there from other rooms but you could hear traffic throughout the night and I was glad to be that bit higher from street level.

Despite a giant sign on the warehouse wall telling the truckers to switch their engines off they ignored it. Even with earplugs it was impossible to sleep the whole night. The hotel rooms are small and it's difficult to find space to open a suitcase. The first night I ordered room service. My roast chicken dinner arrived in a plastic dish with a plastic knife and fork.

We loved the hotel, (even under the circumstances), that we decided to return on our last trip to NY. We were delighted we did! It was like visiting old friends! The staff was amazing (and remembered us!). We had a beautiful room with a city view and balcony. A lovely ""return"" thank you gift and note was waiting for us upon our arrival (thank you again!). They also remembered that I wanted the NY Times delivered to my room and it was at our door every morning upon waking.The hotel's ""Sips and Savories"", a wine and cheese gathering, is a lovely extra and a nice way to get to know the staff and fellow guests. My husband is a bike rider and the hotel gave him one for the entire day. The bike was brand new and the hotel provided a lock and a basket. My husband had a great time riding around the city. Renting bikes can be expensive in NY so this is a wonderful, thoughtful extra. The hotel is in the best area of Manhattan (in my opinion), close to all of the places that we were interested in going to and everything else is easily accessible by subway, walking or cab. Our stay was during a heat wave in NY but we were visiting from Florida so this was not much of an issue for us. The air conditioning worked amazingly well and in balcony rooms, once the door was closed, the street noise was not an issue at all. The roof deck was lovely. My only suggestion would be some large umbrellas for additional shade, but the furniture is comfortable and sunset with a glass of wine was a perfect Manhattan experience. This is a hotel for adults and couples (due to the unique shower/bath configuration). It is rare to find such a gem of a hotel in Manhattan and we are so happy that we are now Nolitan ""family"". We know exactly where we will be staying on our next trip to NY. This is a great hotel; clean, modern, amazingly friendly and helpful staff who are genuine and sincere.

For instance, one weekend we came in and our room was not ready. We dropped our bags and did what we love to do most in the city, walk around. We were tired from partying the night before and had things to do, so I called at 3 to see if our room was ready. Much to my dismay, it was not. About 2 hours later, we went to the hotel to see if it was ready - nope. By this time, it was happy hour in the lobby (can you say, champagne????!!!!!!! awesomeness!!!!!) so we chilled and waited. It was about 20 minutes in, and our room was ready. (Side note: I never lost my cool. That was my 3rd stay, and the girl recognized me.) Well, we were upgraded to a wonderful room WITH a sweet note and a bottle of champagne waiting for us. Amazing! Every time we visit, I request a high floor and they have always accommodated. For the people complaining on size and noise - it's the city. And honestly, the noise and sounds are totally fine. No need for earplugs. We actually sleep with the window cracked a bit; we love the sounds of the city! Size is great for 2 people. I always have a gigantic bag, and I never had a problem with size. My favorite thing in the room (other than the bed) is the FAN!!!! AWESOME!Only thing I would say is something that could be ""better,"" would be the continental breakfast. It looks a bit like what you would see at a low-end chain restaurant....I would suggest maybe giving a break on the menu items (which if you love pancakes or French toast, I would totally eat. It's AMAZING!) in lieu of the pastry spread. That's just my humble opinion. Anyway, this place rocks and I love it! See you again soon!","Phoenix, Arizona","Candace311</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",2,5.0

The building next door -- a parking garage -- was a having a very loud DJ'ed party for the 4th and our room was literally throbbing with bass. We were so close to the party, they actually invited us over. Nice as that was, it wasn't exactly what we had in mind. Mervin, whom we contacted downstairs, was extremely helpful.

Not to mention the daily happy hour(s) with complementary wine and snacks where one can easily connect with other guests.The roof terrace has stunning views on midtown, Williamsburg bridge and the financial district. We recognized installations for a bar, hopefully that materializes eventually…The only downturn (but it was not significant for us) was that our corner room, facing NE/SE, warmed up pretty much on a sunny morning, and the A/C was too noisy to let it run during the night. So if you're sensitive for either, you better pick a SE/SW corner or a SE balcony room. All higher floor rooms have nice views anyway.So bottom line, this was the right choice, and we definitely will come back.

As some people know, it has been pretty horribly rainy weather in New York, and I was really dreading a couple days in the city with a 3-month old baby in tow-- waiting outside for taxis, hauling a stroller around, waiting until 3pm to check in, noise from neighbors and no room for the pack and play. However, from the moment we arrived, soaking wet and really tired, our every need was met and exceeded. We were given a room upgrade to a Corner King and the view and space were cleverly laid out and inviting; loved the small touches like a super cozy cashmere throw at the end of the bed. Best of all, they let us check in early-- total godsend when you have a baby in tow! I'm not saying they will always be able to do this, but the fact that they were willing to try to get us in ahead of time, shows flexibility and this is a sure sign of really good service. They advised us ahead of time that parking next door, instead of using a valet would save us $20/day which is really nice of them. Also, on more than one occasion, the doormen stood outside in the pouring rain to hail us a taxi. Due to the rain, there were not many available in the area but they must have waiting outside for at least 15 minutes, and it was really pouring!They had a happy hour in the lobby lounge with complimentary red wine/white wine/cava and dried fruit, two kinds of cheese, grapes, crackers, nuts and a Bed Head pyjama trunk show. This was so fun because all the staff were in pajamas for the event and the wine and snacks were delicious! The hotel is clearly aimed at hip, travel savvy people of all ages, but one may not initially think of bringing a child.

Only thing that wasn´t all that good, was the a/c that made a lot of noise in the night. Sounded like a truck starting at times...Lobby and restaurant - very nice with a very cool and relaxed atmosphere. The guys at the reception and restaurant were very accommodating and service minded (like all americans are!). The complementary wine and cheese at 5pm was very nice and made for a great atmosphere. My wife injured her leg the day before we arrived, so she came on crutches and we had to rent a wheelchair. When we were leaving, Kimberley arranged for the rental agency to pick up the chair, saving us the trouble. Well done - those are the things that takes the place from good to great. A small tip though; make more out of the rooftop terrace...We had a great time in New York, and will definitely come back.

We also had access to a little roof deck, which everyone can access, we just happened to have a door from our room. There was some noise with the construction downstairs, I think they were building a restaurant, but we weren't around much during the day so it didn't really bother us and never woke us.

While the area isn't quite as trendy as some places nearby, it does have a nice vibe and felt relatively safe even late at night (some bits of the nearby Bowery, by comparison, felt distinctly seedy). There's also a good variety of restaurants and pubs/bars nearby. The Nolitan is only a 5-10 minute walk from the great shopping on Broadway, and the nearest subway station (Spring Street) is likewise only a 5 minute walk away and will get you to midtown in less than 15 minutes on the 6 line (the entrance to the uptown platform is just next to the Duane Reade on the corner of Spring and Lafayette Streets). The rooms themselves are on the small-ish side but well laid out and very comfortable (especially for the price, which was much better than a lot of the other options in the area). The bathrooms in particular are much larger than you'd expect relative to the overall size of the room, and the glass shower looking out onto the room is unusual but helps to make the room feel bigger than it is. The bed was one of the most comfortable that I've come across in a hotel, although a fair bit of street noise does reach the rooms (unless you're a particularly light sleeper, though, it shouldn't be enough to cause problems). The front desk staff were friendly and obliging without being overbearing, and my room was always cleaned to an impeccable standard. Free wifi is available for guests, although speeds can be on the slow side. The only (very minor) downside of the location is that taxis weren't that easy to hail on Kenmare Street, but if you walk around the corner to the Bowery you won't have any trouble finding one.","Canberra, Australia","MattB83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",9,5.0

They also offer free wifi, which seems like such a small thing, but so many hotels still charge for it, so I was pleased not to have this hidden cost. Another amenity that was a nice touch is that they give guests free passes to a local gym. I loved the well-designed lobby area, and the staff were very courteous. They add little touches, like a jar of free popcorn and cold water in the lobby, as well as a free cocktail hour with wine and cheese (which I didn't try), which make you feel welcome there, creating a good ambience.

We had an angle room on the 4th floor (which did not look out to the main road (Kenmare) and were not disturbed by the noise at all. One negative point is the breakfast which I would not book again: the continental breakfast is basically bread and jam and some pastries, no extras. If you want a coffee latte in addition, you pay. On our last day my partner and I decided to skip breakfast and only had a hot tea, our daughter opted for scrambled eggs and the bill came down to following: 3 full continental breakfasts (for 2 teas???) plus scrambled eggs (usd 16 which we had to pay extra since it was not part of the continental breakfast). When we complained, the waiter (very firmly) told us that it didn't matter what they put on our bill since it was the amount the restaurant billed to the hotel and we would only pay for the eggs anyway (that was not quite the point I would say).

In 5 minutes drive you are in Williamsburg Brooklyn the take the Spirits Tour ""buy local"" etc., plus you are next door to the home of fashion's shops. For you newbies that need ChinaTown and Little Italy, we won't judge you for going.  The Hotel reflects the side of New York you have only heard of. The staff are not condescending to the ""clueless"" tourists and can give you the resident opinion of the constantly changing food scene of lower Manhattan. As I'm writing this everyone in the lobby is bilingual mostly from the EU. Obviously everyone can have a bad day at work but I've never seen a consistently proactive group in the staff. The rooms are perfect for adult chill time. Last time I stayed was +1 year right after opening. Mostly couples stay in my opinion, if you need a kiddy pool seek life elsewhere, this is NYC.

We stayed in a room with a balcony which some people have commented that it makes the room smaller and you don't go out on it very much, but I loved having access to fresh air and a place to view the street. Our bed was amazingly comfortable and the mini-fridge allowed us to remove items so we could put our own beverages and snacks in it. We did not get yelled at for doing this (some hotels hate this). Out first night had lovely turn down service with homemade macrons instead of the usual chocolate piece. The shower is unique and may be uncomfortable for some guests; it is in the room (not separated as the toilet is). There is a curtain on the side that faces out, but if you are in a room that is this cozy, I can't imagine that you would be shy about the shower. The toiletries are by Red Flower and if you know the brand...they are quite yummy. Anything else that was needed or any request made was met with a smile and absolutely no attitude. Pride was taken in making sure that the room was spotless. The robes were cozy and I loved the slippers! A newspaper was at our door every morning. During our stay, the restaurant was still under construction. This was a bit of a disappointment but not so much so that it made our stay any less special. Mornings had coffee and tea ready in the lobby along with fruit and toast and bagels and sweet rolls. The lobby in the late afternoon was a time to have a glass of wine with the other guests and some noshes for a casual break before any evening plans. A note on the lobby; it was so lovely, especially after dark when a beautiful screen projection produced a magical atmosphere. The modernist chandelier was spectacular also. Another plus, if you care about such things; most hotels have a ""library"" that consists of paperbacks and bad novels left by guests. The Nolitan has an art library! An amazing selection of art and design and architecture books that you are welcome to take to your room. Oh, and I'm forgetting the roofgarden; an area that has a breathtaking view of downtown, including the yet to be completed Freedom Tower. In warmer months this feature would be a must, although even in October, it was lovely to take in the expansive view.So the reason for our visit to New York was to attend my 40th high school reunion on Long Island. The reunion was on Saturday, October 27th. We arrived in New York on Thursday, October 25th, and had reservations to return to Florida on Monday, October 29th. The reunion was terrific and although there was a bit of a concern about a storm called Sandy, no one could predict was exactly was going to happen during the next few days. On Sunday back at the hotel, the weather was not looking so great. A day to rest and listen to the news and make sure friends and family were taking this storm seriously. We had also heard from our airline that we would not be flying on Monday...oh really? So as Monday turned uglier and uglier...Superstorm Sandy had arrived. But the staff at The Nolitan could not have been more gracious. Most of them had been up all night monitoring the storm. They had brought extra clothes and looked totality professional in the chaos that was downtown. The power went out but the lobby had a generator and the elevators never stopped working. And people were scared and the staff did everything they could to clam every guest. They made phone calls, they had hot water and hot coffee and they always were sympathetic and kind. Due to the construction of the restaurant, part of the lobby was cold and threatened to be wet. So it was closed off (and those lovely art books placed somewhere safe). What was amazing was that The Nolitan was one of the few businesses that had any power and without any cell service, we were relying on our iPads and computers and the internet access on our smart phones. And every guest had at least three electronic devices that needed charging and the staff charged ever one of those devices without question.And in speaking to people who were hanging out in the lobby (there was really nowhere else to go) I found out that the staff was charging the phones and computers of their neighbors!!! This truly convinced me of how special all of the staff was! They were helping people who were not staying at the hotel because they were being good neighbors and because it was the right thing to do! And many of those neighbors were hanging out in the lobby just to be with other people as it was very scary to be alone in the dark in New York.and speaking of...I have never seen New York so dark before. It was almost impossible to go outside; no street lights, no traffic lights, no store lights; just total darkness. And somehow The Nolitan managed to keep us all safe and warm and with some light and with snacks and beverages and a feeling that we were in this together and it could have been so much worse as it was a few blocks below us and in Staten Island and Long Island and New Jersey and Queens...Our rooms did not have power, but we were given flashlights to move around and we were only in the room to sleep. The lobby became command central. The Nolitan was becoming home. At 3 AM I was in the lobby in my pj's and a sweater trying to contact the airline (JetBlue damn them!) on the hotel's landlines which were operational. In the morning the staff called at least six pharmacies for me to see if any in the area were open (note to self and those who take daily meds; pack lot's of extras!!!). None were open but they kept trying because by now we were all feeling like family. Also NYPD came to the neighborhood and began to direct traffic when the streets were finally safe to pass, but the traffic lights were still out. And where did they take breaks to use the facilities and have a nice hot cup of coffee. Well, the lobby of The Nolitan of course!!!We finally left New York on Friday, and after the most complicated trip I have ever experienced we returned to Florida around November 4th.But I can't wait to return to The Nolitan! Everyone was so kind and helpful and they put the well-being of their guests above all else. I'm sure the staff had their own personal worries, but they were there for us and always professional and kind. So I'm hoping for a trip when it is warm enough to enjoy the roofgraden and the new restaurant and take a bike and ride around the city and to say hi to all of the great staff that made what could have been a terrible situation into something where you know you have just seen the very best that people can be.

I'm very grateful to Nolitan for their flexibility.Now the hotel - it was awesome. The neighborhood was fantastic - in the lower east side - my new favorite hood to hang out in - near the Williamsburg bridge. We had great eats that weekend near the hotel, including the south Willaimsburg area after a pleasant beautiful walk over the bridge. The room was bigger than expected (especially given NYC) and the bed was awesomely comfortable (check pic). The shower was ""open"" - meaning that the shower had glass walls into the bedroom. There is a curtain one can pull for privacy ...... though it's a bit awkward to shower some openly, it does add to the room feeling bigger as the whole space appears ""open"". The staff were very helpful and friendly - which added to a great stay. Love the lobby and wished I had more time to hang in it. We discovered in the late afternoon / early evening - free wine and snacks were available. The hotel had extra perks such as bike and skateboard rentals (which I think were free but I could be mistaken). Given that it was January, we're not renting bikes but still loved that they were there to use. And if you forgot your laptop, they had ipads one could use. Oh and there's a fantastic balcony ..... though too cold for us to use but I did love it.Overall, I loved it. And would absolutely stay there again.

The suite was on the eight floor and had amazing views - looking uptown you could see empire state building, Chrysler building, etc. and looking east you could then see the Williamsburg bridge. Although the views from the rooftop are even better. The suite its self was set up very well and the living room area is big enough that you can easily entertain a few people. The huge soaking tub, which easily fits two, and rain shower were probably my favorite part of the suite. The design was clean and modern with a slight retro feel. When our photographers were taking photos they mentioned it looked very ""mad men.""The staff of the hotel was very eager to please and accommodating. The night of our arrival along with our wedding night they left champagne and a note congratulating us. They also gave us a very good rate on our block of rooms including a discounted rate on the suite.The restaurant was under construction while we were there but it didn't really impact us. They offered a light breakfast, most days we just grabbed a delicious bagel, and wine and cheese in the evenings. The location was excellent and it is only a short walk to the subway (Spring St. or Canal St.). One additional big plus to the location, at least for us, is that its in the heart of Nolita which means you are just a short walk to little italy, soho, LES, etc. so there is a ton of stuff to do but you are away from the crowds of tourist.We will defiantly stay here again on future trips to NYC.","Atlanta, Georgia","Prim8Keeper</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",23,5.0

We received a pretty good rate for Manhattan as a group booking, and we all had a good stay!The rooms are very small but very efficiently laid out. We said it reminded us of those sample display rooms at IKEA! The bed was outstanding, especially the linens, some of the best we have ever slept on. The shower configuration was interesting, with glass walls on opposite sides, and a curtain on the room side for privacy but none on the sink side (and no door). Having the toilet in a separate little room helps.There is no dresser or place to open a suitcase other than the bed, but the closet is large enough to store everything. We had emptied the mini-fridge (it is FULL of items to purchase!) and used it to cool our own drinks. The continental breakfast is minimal, but the items that are available are tasty. There are no tables in the lobby, but several comfy seating areas to relax and have your pastry and coffee or tea. The weather during our stay was cold and wet, so we did not use the complimentary bikes (although we saw some people returning theirs after using them in the rain!). The walk to the Spring Street subway station isn't bad, 2-3 blocks. It's a good location, as long as you are willing to use the subway or a taxi to get to Times Square and beyond. The area around the hotel is fun, with several nice shops and cafes. They were remodeling the restaurant while we were there, which included a temporary lobby entrance, but it was not a problem. We parked our car in the garage across the street and did not use it again until we left. It's not very clear (at least to us non-Manhattanites!) what the procedure is, but you pull in and stop by the office door just off the street. They will come out and give you a ticket, then park your car for you. (They will also do this from the hotel, but it is more expensive. To do it yourself at the garage is only about 20 yards further than the hotel entrance!) I only mention this because we were thinking we would be parking it ourselves, and have time to gather our things from the van at that time. Instead, we had to kind of scramble to get everything we needed out of the van to take it across the street to the hotel. Not a big deal, just something we were not aware of.We enjoyed our stay and, depending on price, would choose the Nolitan again for a Manhattan stay.",ohio,"subtchr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>ohio</strong>",7,4.0

We stayed from 23rd Dec to 1st Jan - I had heard and read many good things about this hotel before our trip and it was also in the ideal location for us! We couldn't stand the thought of staying around midtown with the masses of other tourists and wanted an area that was more 'low key'.The hotel is right in the heart of downtown and walking distance to Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy, many fantastic restaurants, cafes, shops and the subway stops are close by in every direction you walk. The hotel is on quite a busy road but don't let this put you off, as soon as your off Kenmare street its like your in a different world! Also as mentioned not as touristy around these parts which was great for us and we felt like more of a local than a tourist.The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly - they were more than happy to give tips on whats good to do in the area and help with any querie we had.The rooms were very well designed with a good layout and very clean however they are quite small but from what I hear most rooms across NYC are small! We stayed in the deluxe queen room with balcony and were on the 9th floor and had a great view of the city and Empire State Building. I had read that people complained about the street noise level but we didn't find the outside traffic noise to be an issue at all - I'm not sure if this is more of a problem on lower levels.The hotel offers free bike rental which we thought was great and qw made use of this a couple of times, its on a first in first serve basis.Free wine and cheese daily in the afternoons was a nice touch - it was nice to pop down for a glass of wine and snack before heading out for the evening. Its also a good way to meet other hotel guests staying there and get to know the staff better.Also the hotel is the great value for money. NYC accomodation is so overpriced and I was pleasantly surprised how reasonable the room prices were considering the location, included continental breakfast, bike hire, wine and cheese etc etc.The things we didn't love was we struggled to put our suitcases anywhere in the room as it was so small and they were always in the way, especially by the end of our stay as we had four large suticases!The restuarant wasn't opened yet (which isn't a fault of the hotel) it was just disappointing that we didn't get a chance to enjoy and the lobby was more of a construction site at the time. We were told that this is meant to be up and running mid/end Jan.Continental breakfast was just okay which was served in the lobby - just juice, coffee and pastries - we only stopped by once. Maybe when the restuarant is up and running this may change and they may offer more of a selection.If we ever return to NYC we would stay here again. I think the opening of the restuarant will be a huge benefit to this small boutique hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","Allana J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",30,4.0

Such a good decision. We've stayed upper east side, midtown east, and upper west side, but we liked this location by far the best. Things we loved: The neighborhood was great. Kenmare is a busy and not particularly charming street, but within a block or two in any direction we found fun and funky shops, boutiques, and restaurants. We loved being in easy walking distance to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, Little Italy bakeries, Chinatown, coffee shops, and several subway lines. Unlike a lot of NY hotels, we felt like we were in a neighborhood with locals, not a commercial district with other tourists. The rooms were great. Small, yes, but well-designed with good electronics, separate toilet and shower, good mattress/pillows. Very much liked the rough cement elements and the linens were very nice. We were on 5th floor so we heard a good bit of street noise, but on higher floors it probably wouldn't be as much of an issue. We didn't love:The work-in-progress status. We were there on a cold December weekend, and the lobby was freezing cold. The work on the restaurant (?) involved a semi-open construction area with a tarp, combined with no vestibule on the main hotel doors meant the lobby was just a cold hallway between the elevator and the street with frigid winds every time the door opened. The staff. We enountered a few bumps in our customer service road. I was getting us checked in while my husband was unloading luggage from our hired car (hello, bellhop anywhere?) and when he joined me at the check-in desk the staffer asked us a series of confused and confusing questions about if we needed separate rooms (?!). The next day we asked about getting a cab to the Theater District, and if the staff could call one for us later that evening. The bellhop suggested we just walk a few blocks and then try to hail one on the next busy street. Really?! All in all, we really did enjoy our stay, despite the staff goofs (judging from others' reviews, I gather that better service is the norm). The location is fantastic and the space is lovely.

This is a place with a ""soul""...complementary little breakfast in the hall, wine and cheese between 6 and 8pm, where you can meet people...This is really nice...As it becomes more and more famous, the hotel will need to keep that spirit going...The rooms are very small but extremely well organized.

Not good. The rooms can turn out to be very cold...and you have then to put the heat on but it makes so much noise that it would be impossible almost to sleep with it.

Given we were booking four rooms for a week we made our booking direct with the hotel.It was the first time we had stayed in this area of Manhattan and following our visit we would most definitely look to stay in the same area if, and when, we come back to New York. It proved easy to navigate Manhattan with a number of subway stations nearby. In addition there are ample bars, restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood that we made good use of and gave a real community feel that you don’t necessarily get in Times Square.We booked a Cityscape Corner room and we were allocated room 902 – would recommend. The room was both spacious and clean and from our experience of other NY hotels offered excellent value for money. We both liked the ‘industrial’ feel of the unfinished concrete ceiling. The other finishes in the room were all of high quality.The bed was both large and very comfortable and neither of us had any issues sleeping. Even the traffic noise from down below didn’t cause us any major issues although it may have been more of an issue if you had been sleeping on one of the lower floors.Both the shower and free-standing bath in our room were great. The shower was large and powerful which makes such a difference from a weak shower that gives you barely a trickle of water. The free-standing bath was large and provided great views of the Empire State Building as we lay relaxing in the tub. As it is ‘part’ of the room it may be a little strange for those who like to sit in the bath in total privacy but it wasn’t something that bothered us.As our room was on the top floor, occupied a corner position, and had floor to ceiling windows we had amazing views of the mid-town skyline (Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, etc) and also east towards the Williamburg Bridge. Equally, you could go to the roof-top of the hotel and get fantastic views in the same directions but also towards the financial district.WiFi was available in rooms (and public areas) free - as it should be! There was good coverage and we never experienced any issues connecting or major issues with speed (iPhone and iPad usage).There was a continental breakfast included free but it was only fruit juice, tea/coffee and bagels/pastries. A selection of cereals and fruit would have been a nice addition. Hopefully this will improve once the new restaurant opens later this month.Overall we would highly recommend the Nolitan Hotel. It provided a great base for us for our trip and we loved the style and feel of the hotel. Service from staff was superb and we can’t fault them.

But it was more things mentioned by other reviewers like size of the rooms (they are smaller than I expected compared to similar hotels in New York) and the front facing Kenmare Street (which is pretty noisy in the evenings as it's a funnel to Houston) and worst was the incomplete restaurant build which left a gaping hole to the lobby, which meant it was almost inhabitable and both staff and guests had to huddle around heaters most evenings enjoying the -1 degree temperatures. Why they couldn't build a temporary wall was really beyond me. Staff told me the build was meant to be completed by mid-December. Would I come back? Well my deal was excellent but when I asked for an upgrade to a corner room (which was larger), I was told this would cost me extra and they would only be a couple of days available.

I didn't make it to the modest free breakfast but we very much enjoyed the wine and snacks in the evening, generously from 6-8pm, thanks Joy! The staff were uniformly pleasant and several times gave me a cup of tea (at no charge) when asked as there was no tea in the room. I appreciate the tea and coffee in the lobby till noon.The room was relatively small but this is typical for NY and it was better designed than most. I liked the open shower (which made the room seem larger) and the separate loo. Loved that they had Red Flower products - thankfully paraben free!The location is wonderful, close to several subways, Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy and the LES, we loved it.

I usually stay in Midtown because it's close to everything I want to see but this time, a friend talked me into trying the Lower East Side, and we chose the Nolitan after reading its terrific reviews here. It's true what they say on Tripadvisor - the staff are wonderful: friendly, helpful, polite, good humoured. We arrived very late at night after a long flight, and still received a warm welcome.I spent the first night on level 3 in what to me was a very small room. My best advice for anyone who is going to be a new guest, is request a room that is higher up as there will be less street noise. It will be worth the extra money. Go for a corner room if you can. After the first night, I complained about the noise (I am quite a light sleeper) and was offered a corner room on the top floor at a discounted price. I took it! My NEW room had a divine free-standing bath and a gorgeous view of the Williamsberg Bridge. The bed was superb, however all this does come at a price. I paid $477 a night (online) for the room on the lower floor and $75 more for the discounted room on the top floor.The Nolitan is situated in easy walking distance between THREE different Metro stops, which is by far and away the best way to get around New York. The hotel really is in a good position and it is only a few stops up to Midtown. One stop south is the beautiful Brooklyn Bridge over which I highly recommend a casual stroll. The hotel is also situated in the middle of an astonishing number of cafes, restaurants and bars in and around NoLita. There is a brilliant little Japanese restaurant around the corner (ask the staff to recommend it), a great cake shop and a really well-stocked bookshop for those of you who need a relaxing read. It would be difficult to ask for more. Oh, and there is free wine and cheese in the afternoon. That sold me.My one tiny criticism is that the continental breakfast could be a little bit more extensive.So, to sum up, if you can afford it, do it.

In fact, I would even go as far as to say that it would compete with many hotels in the downtown Manhatten area, regardless of price. It is your classic boutique hotel without the snobbery you may find elsewhere. The rooms are small, yes, but are so quaint and designed with the utmost functionality in mind. Given it is NYC you will not be spending much time in your room anyway! If you are like me and my wife, all you want it a nice, clean place to come back to with an awesome shower. This has all that and more! It has a raw, industrial finish, with exposed shower, yet still manages to feel homely (this is helped with finishing touches like the cashmere throw and yoga mat).The location could not be better. It is within walking distance to the subways (multiple lines), great eateries and all the shopping that SoHo and the surrounding area have to offer! It is the perfect launching pad whether you are NYC initiated or not (it was our first time and we never felt far from the action).The rooms on Kenmare Street can be noisy as it is quite busy, so I would suggest some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. I didn't have a problem but my wife needed them. The black out blinds are great though.Lastly, the service is impeccable. I booked the trip as a birthday surprise for my wife, we were greeted in our room with a bottle of champagne. The advice provided by staff was fantastic and they were always helpful. The rooms were spotless. And when we forgot our passports in our safe, they were so quick to get the car service to drop them off to us at the airport (and we thankfully made our flights).

The location is premium if you want to be in Manhattan, all subway lines within walking distance, close to LES, Soho, Shopping etc etc. Nice bathroom with separate toilet but rooms a tad small, especially if you have plenty of luggage which we did. Continental breakfast was pretty average, simple fare and not much of it however the wine and cheese hour in the evening made up for it - i just wish they would play some decent music and not current pop/electronic dance crap! It's the foyer of a funky downtown hotel for god's sake, not a teenage bedroom! I literally would have to take the food or wine up to our room as the music was that abhorrent. If management read this, track down some Mulatu, or labels like g-stone or ubiquity. These are well known and easy to find and a damn side better considering the crowd you have in your hotel!! The air conditioning in the rooms was the other bad that really let this hotel down in my opinion. It was so noisy, like a plane taking off every time the thermostat kicked in. I did complain as i am a light sleeper and during the night it came on probably 3 times an hour so it kept waking me up. (i am a light-ish sleeper). The staff were nice and offered to move us to another room, but the problem was the same across the board. For a hotel that's only a year or so old, i feel this is a big screw up for them (i think they are well aware of it too by the response we got). That aside, the hotel was decent and the rooftop that anyone can go up to offers great views.","Burleigh Heads, Australia","nZed808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burleigh Heads, Australia</strong>",94,4.0

It's a new hotel and the room was immaculate, linens and towels plush and the bed was quite comfortable. Our only concern about noise was that the metal doors did not create a great seal for sound and you can hear things in the hallway. There must be some molding that could fix that. There are only 7 or so rooms on each floor so not THAT much happens in the hall but I would assume it would cffect rooms closer to the elevator.The rooftop lounge was great as were the offerings of wine/cheese in the afternoon and continental breakfast in the am.

I arrived for the CB at 9:30am only to find nothing left but yogurt. Second day the bagels were stale. In addition, turndown service did not include tidy up - garbage not removed, glasses not replaced. I did ask about the turndown service, but I recieved no response to my query. I did love the location, the room was fabulous and the people were terrific. Loved the rooftop terrace as an oasis of serenity! Could have been a little cleaner up there.....no garbage can provided so folks just left their garbage. I will consider the hotel again, as these issues are easily fixed and not a deal breaker for me --- a request was sent for my feedback and I am looking forward to see if these issues are resolved for the future. I would definately consider booking this hotel again, the rooms, while small, are well organized, comfortable and very clean. I had the neighbourhood corner and it was truly lovely!

Traffic is a disaster at all hours. The neighbourhood is very safe - I walked alone at 1 pm at night and did not feel uncomfortable. Serviced by many subway stops, tons of amazing restaurants - this property could not be more well located to see the heartbeat of NYC!

The staff is unfailingly helpful and eager to please. An example from our recent stay: because the restaurant was undergoing renovations and therefore unavailable, they compensated in three ways: you could order from a group of 15 excellent area restaurants and staff would bring it to your room; there was complimentary continental breakfast each morning; and there was a cocktail hour from 6-8 that included free wine/sparkling wine and snacks.

I wanted a boutique hotel in the LES that was a guaranteed, sure-bet great exprience, and that's what we got. I paid ahead and splurged for the Corner King for a surprise weekend birthday get-away. the room was a perfect size for 2, with views of the river on one corner, and the Empire State Building the other. At night, it was spectacular! CONCIERGE:The front desk staff double as concierges - that's a new thing, apparently - so they were still a bit green around the gills helping us find some information, but they're absolutely wonderful and kind, and infinitely patient. They also managed to secure a dining reservation at Le Bernardin on a Friday night when I could not, which gets them bonus points in my book!FOOD: The continental breakfast is very basic and blah (though the coffee was good), but their restaurant was under renovation when we were there, so I'm withholding judgement on the food angle, but they do get points for arranging delivery from 15 area restaurants including famed Blue Ribbon Bakery, which they plate on-site with real silverware - a very clever 'stop-gap' measure that actually gives you access to some amazing food without the wait in line!There's a tiny Asian hotdog shop a block away that has outstanding food for cheap - the kimchee dog is great, and the corn dog was sooo good... virtually no seating, but if you're just wanting a quick bite, highly recommended. The market, 5 blocks away, has TONS of great food options for self-catering, or just for munching - it's not for tourists, it really is mostly locals... ask the front desk for directions. There's also a kosher bagel place in walking distance that caters to locals and is very bare-bones, but is amazing. LOCATION:The location is very close to all the major LES shopping streets, subway, and just blocks away from some incredible ethnic eats. In fact, we took a food tour with The Enthusiatic Gourmet, and we were able to simply walk five blocks to the old market to meet her, and spent half a day touring Jewish, Italian, and Chinese neighborhoods all in walking distance of the hotel - it was a complete blast (found her on TripAdvisor, and highly recommend it too).ROOM:The picture is just the slightest bit deceptive.... in the King Corner, the photos appear that you could see the skyline from the free-standing (AWESOME) tub - but the placement of the work desk and flat screen TV actually interferes with this, so you can see out the window to the sky, but not the skyline per se. Not a dealbreaker, just a bit of a bummer. Similiarly, it appears that the windows are floor-to-ceiling panoramic views, but in reality it's a cleverly designed window that has mostly frosted (opaque) glass, with a few key panels of clear glass giving that amazing view. This means that you have masses of beautiful sunlight, but you have about 18""-24"" of actual ""view"" windows to see the skyline - which you can see from the bed, but it's not a sweeping panoramic view as I expected. On the other hand, you don't feel compelled to close the curtains when you shower/bathe/dress, which is nice - and I did wonder about the privacy with all-glass on the room.The toilet is separate from the sink, in the European pre-war style. The corner king had a lovely glass shower plus the awesome soak tub - it wasn't big enough for my six-footer and me to comfortably be in together, but it was wonderfully deep and perfect for my LUSH bath bombs - which I forgot to bring with, but there's a LUSH just blocks away from the hotel!The ""minibar"" is divided into a mini fridge in the closet, and snacks in the bedside drawer... you can choose what you want to have ready ahead of time with a clever survey on their website - where you can also request gym passes, newspapers, and other amenities. There are also myriad ""adult toy"" options on their menu, which I thought was a fun touch ,and optional add-ons including wine or champagne in the room, cheese plate, chocolates, and even rose petals scattered on the bed... they really have the best a la carte menu for room options I've found!The main floor has lots of seating areas for lounging and meetingup, and a functional library that is actually somewhere you'd WANT to hang out and relax - something no hotel lobby usually does for me. I didn't make it to the rooftop deck, because we always went out early and got back late, but other reviews say it's a priceless view - and considering the view we had from our top-floor room, I can only say I would agree.There's a safe cleverly built into the bedframe, which is easy to acces, and fits a standard laptop plus other stuff.The closet has the usual amenities - robes, slippers, large umbrella, etc.WIFI: we had no problem accessing wifi, included in the room price (thank you!)TAXI CAUTION: It's difficult to get a taxi FROM the hotel, just due to the location - the front desk staff know it so if you are planning to catch a plane or train, highly recommend consulting them the day before to discuss car service or other arrangements... it took us 30 minutes on a Sunday to find a taxi, and we had to walk about six blocks with our luggage to get to a street where we had a chance to find one not occupied.","Alexandria, Virginia","Bec215</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alexandria, Virginia</strong>",32,5.0

Our recent stay at the Nolitan (our first time there) puts them at the top of our NYC hotel list.The room design was really fun and quirky. For example, the toilet was in its own room, away from the sink and shower. The shower had a clear glass wall to the bedroom (and a privacy curtain for the prudish). Floor-to-ceiling windows with great views from our high-floor room (8th). Bare cement ceiling and wall contrasted by high-end fixtures with other walls dressed in white plaster.Staff were helpful and nice. The team seemed down-to-earth and authentic.Continental breakfast hit the spot - bagels, cream cheese, yogurt, pastries, coffee and juices.Nolita is a great place to explore and close to the hustle of SOHO.We'll be back, soon.","New York City, New York","InternationalHorizon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",9,5.0

We stayed for my wife's birthday and upon returning from dinner we found a card & bottle of Prosecco on ice waiting for us. What a classy customer service move. A+. The staff were all extremely friendly, helpful, and polite. No attitudes, no short answers, nothing but smiles and a genuine desire to help answer any questions we had.The room was on the small side, but was ultra modern and very clean. We loved it as it's definitely our preferred style. The bed was so comfortable we slept like babies. Everything worked great from the AC, to the tv, to the shower and toilet. No issues at all. New release movies are $18 which we found exorbitant so we didn't bother, but the mini bar prices are really good - $3 beers?? Yes please.Can't say enough about the location - two blocks west and you're in Soho, 1 block south and you're on the border of Chinatown and Little Italy. Head north and you're in the East Village in no time. 25 min walk south to the Brooklyn Bridge. Simply perfect.The rooftop deck is worth the price of admission alone. The views are seriously insane and it's open 24 hrs. We took a ton of photos and sat up there with a beer/cocktail and just soaked it all in. I would HIGHLY recommend this hotel to anyone. Yes, it's pricey, so perhaps not for more than 3 or 4 nights - depending on your budget, but welcome to New York prices.

There were minor quibbles (small room...of course, it's New York!), a loud air conditioning system, and a rather light continental breakfast, but they were all minor points compared to the hotel's pluses.Hints for people looking for meals: Barmarche, just up Elizabeth Street at Spring, was a fantastic dinner choice.

Great modern touches throughout, exceptionally comfy bed & pillows, nice toiletries, delicious chocolates on our pillows on arrival, in-room safe, great little balcony. Although in a brilliant location just north of Little Italy, adjacent to Chinatown, with amazing restaurants, cafes & bakeries right around the corner, we still loved the complimentary continental breakfast.

However, for my most recent trip, I was open to recommendations for lodging since the rates at my usual hotel were a bit on the extreme side. (Nearby hotels were no better.) Thus, I was told to check out the Nolitan. Not only was it reasonably priced (relative to what my usual hotel was charging), it was accessible to work via taxi or subway and very, very chic.I arrived a tad early for check-in, but the staff was kind enough to hold my bags while I sought out lunch. As soon as my room was ready, I was notified right away. I've stayed at hotels where the staff was inattentive. This was not the case at the Nolitan. From the moment I stepped through the door, I knew I would be in good hands.My room was tiny, but since I was traveling alone, this was hardly an issue. It was tastefully decorated, white with red accents. I'd almost consider it a ""clean"" look. What I found interesting was the open bathroom: the shower and sink area did not have a doorway. (The shower itself, however, did have a glass door!) As for the toilet? That's in a room of its own. It almost reminded me of when I traveled to Japan, so while it was a bit unusual for me to see it here in the States, I wasn't completely confused by it. The room also had a balcony, which, had I anticipated staying in my room for an extended period of time, would have served as a nice little relaxation space. Granted, I didn't have a stellar city view (I faced a mechanic's garage, among other stores), but I also don't mind people-watching. (It's worth noting here that despite having a neighborhood view, I slept well each night. Noise was not an issue.)One thing I really appreciated was the alarm clock, which also featured an iPod / iPhone dock. I have an iPhone 4S, and I have been at hotels (including my usual hotel in Brooklyn) that have clocks with iPhone docks that don't support a 4S. This may seem like a minor thing for many, but I had left my charger at home -- this was extremely helpful!If I have one teeny-tiny complaint: The A/C is LOUD. Fortunately, my room was equipped with a ceiling fan. I was just as cool, but with much less noise.So: An attentive staff. Chic, comfortable rooms. Easy access to work (and other areas, such as one of my favorites -- Soho!) Decent pricing. I think I've found my new business hotel here at The Nolitan.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","IkkiTousen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",21,5.0

While we left them at home in Miami Beach- we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend in NYC thanks to The Nolitan and all the comforts of our home it offered us. The location is amazing especially if you love downtown NYC neighborhoods such as Soho, Nolita, LES, West Village and Greenwich Village. All are within a 10 minute walk- if not less. You have amazing amazing restaurants and bars around you- all buzzing til early hours of the morning and you have amazing little indie owned shops filled with unique fashion, art and tchotkes. The charm of the surrounding Nolita neighborhood spills into the warm walls of this hotel. The staff are all SUPER SUPER NICE! The doormen are my new best friends. Always smiling and genuine in their manner. They make you feel comfortable- like the best of friends do for you.Architecturally- the interiors boast simple finishes such as exposed concrete walls, fabric wall panels, Serge Mouille chandeliers and a sunken library lounge to check out some cool books. Rooms are small (typical of NYC hotels anyway) but offer all the comforts you need. The mini bar is affordable and well stocked- and so are the snacks! The showers are open/exposed- so you don't feel confined which I love- and the bathroom is stocked with Red Flower toiletries made with love, right up the street. The beds are heavenly soft with down pillows and best of all check-out time is 1pm- which was helpful on my hungover Sunday morning of departure.My husband was thrilled to take out a house skateboard and explore NYC on a Saturday morning while I got my beauty sleep. He was stoked to be able to skate along the West Side Highway and through the streets of the lower east side.They are currently having a new restaurant operator come into the ground floor dining space- but the continental breakfast is quite delicious!!! Big fluffy english muffins, super delish granola and mini pastries- all super simple and yummy.All in all- a hotel review is relative to who reviews it- so it's good to know that we are also very laid back people; both from design backgrounds- so we value good and simple design when constructed propertly; detest cruises, Disneyland and anything conventionally touristy or 'group oriented'; and love urban living and delicious foooood! So for us- The Nolitan was heaven.Since our May trip, I have been back to The Nolitan a few more times, on my own for work- and will continue to stay again and again. I now consider it my home away from home- in all it's minimal, laid back, urban, comfortable glory...","Miami Beach, Florida","annabellala</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami Beach, Florida</strong>",4,5.0

When we arrived we were dissapointed to find that the rooftop and restaurant are essentially non-existent..on top of that when we got to our city view balcony room it was TINY. I understand NYC hotels are small, especially in the boutique group, but this was really small. For the price tag the hotel just did not deliver. Even the rooms looked sort of tired for a newer hotel. The biggest warning and turn off was that they tried to get us to pay for an upgrade at check in. I actually almost took them up on the offer as it was only $35/night and we could get a king room. On second thought however I decided to stick with our original booking. I am glad I did - when I looked online to see what the difference in the upgrade offer room was and our booked room it was actually CHEAPER!!! They tried to get us to pay for a downgrade! I feel so uncomfortable about this. I also heard them trying to upgrade the people who came in after us. On checkout I asked the gentelman who checked us in about his offer and asked him why he was trying to get us to pay more for a downgraded room - he said he was offering a better room on a higher floor but we were already staying in a city view. When i told him that he said he was offering a corner room - it would have made sense but I specifically asked when trying to decide if we should take the offer if it was a corner room he was offering - he said No - just a king room and the only difference would be the size of the bed.Maybe it was a mis-understanding but it just isn't settling well with me. BEWARE of this tactic - it's a trick.I will say the people were friendly and service was good too - unfortunately not enough to make up for the other short comings.","Portland, Maine","mainetraveler555</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Maine</strong>",12,2.0

The first is the noise, which is expected to some extent in NYC but the walls are paper thin and you can hear your neighbors tv and coughing, the street noise on Kenmare street is pretty bad too, simple insulation and sound proof windows would help this if they wanted to improve this. The lack of restaurant or room service is obvious with the closing of their restaurant, but the continental breakfast each morning makes up for this somewhat. The room sizes were pretty small even for upgrade to corner room, this pales in comparison to similar priced rooms at other new hotels in NYC like the Mondrian.

This place has many great features:1. The location is fantastic - Nolita is one of my favorite neighborhoods in New York, filled with great little restaurants and bars (try Cafe Habana, Bread, & Epistrophy, and a hundred others!) and unique boutiques. (See Erica Weiner, Love Adorned and Metal Pointu's if you like jewelry). It is a short walk to Soho, Lower East Side, Little Italy, China Town, etc. It's right in the middle of it all, if you want the gritty, lower New York experience.2. The hotel lobby is modern and warm. Every evening they turn on an animated art light that looks like flowering vines blowing in the breeze. 3.The front desk is helpful, and the doorman is super friendly and welcoming (hi Felix!). He remembers everyone and makes you feel like a VIP.4.The rooms are small and simple, but well-planned and bright. The bathroom was great, and there IS a curtain you can use for privacy in those infamous glass showers. Not a problem at all. My room had a balcony which was a nice touch.5. Wi Fi and The New York Times are included.My only complaints are:1. There is no operating restaurant or bar.2. The included continental breakfast is pretty minimal (and no real protein avail) Coffee was great, tho!3. Hallways are very dark.4.

No big deal, just a shame in such a nice-looking space it wasn't thought out a little more by the architects. Also, there's only one small space for one bag in the closet, so extra luggage ends up on the floor (maybe add a bag-stand, management?). Maybe the standard size rooms make better use of their limited space? I'm just not sure of the value of paying extra for the corner room if you're after more space.The staff were lovely and gave exactly the service you want when you stay in a small boutique hotel. They remember your name, they always have a smile on their faces, they give you umbrellas when it rains, they get you take out from local restaurants and deliver it to your room! The best service I've had in a NYC hotel, with absolutely no hint of pretentiousness.The restaurant was closed while I stayed, so a simple breakfast was provided. A nice touch, though it was very basic and felt like it was temporary and kind of thrown together. Still, nice to be able to grab something before heading out for the day.Two other small things, the AC was REALLY loud and right above the bed, and made it hard to get to sleep the first few nights. The traffic here can be a bit loud, so I preferred AC over traffic, but not ideal. And they seemed to have way less cable TV channels than most hotels, which seems a bit cheap. Weird.Location is great, moments to great restaurants like La Esquina, Bathazar, and all Nolita and SoHo has to offer.

Our room (with a king bed) was good size by New York standards and beautifully appointed. There was even a yoga mat in the closet for our use. The continental breakfast was delicious. There are free bikes and skateboards to get around the neighborhood. But most of all the hotel's design and location are what we carried away with us.

I really admired how they utilized the space in quite small rooms to make them feel airy, light and luxurious. Loved the see through shower and mini bar treats. The manager sent up a complimentary bottle of bubbly for my birthday and a handwritten card. Really nice. Very helpful staff and just a great vibe. We met two women from Holland who had borrowed bikes from the hotel and cycled to Coney Island for the day. I have no complaints at all about this hotel. Free newspaper in the morning and breakfast (which I did not try). This pace will become my monthly night away with my wife from kids and stress. A great New York experience, even for a New Yorker.

I had been wanting to stay here since they opened, so I thought I'd take advantage of the great rate & glad I did- I really loved my room! Ben checked me in & he was a great first impression- he was relaxed, cool, super friendly & upgraded me to a Cityscape room on the top floor of the hotel, which was the 9th floor- thanks Ben! I was in room 901- my room was quite small, with cool hardwood floors, a concrete ceiling, a slim wooden desk with an awesome chair, Rose scented Red Flower Bath products that were lovely, super comfy bed with soft linens & great pillows, amazing shower, & an awesome view of the Williamsburg bridge! I loved the feel of the room & was very comfortable! When I called down I was able to extend until 2pm (check out is at 1pm, which is very nice to begin with!) & the hotel provided a delectable little chocolate treat on my bed at turndown service- really nice touch, including the weather card for the next day. However, there are a few things that you should keep in my mind when staying at The Nolitan- even though I was on the highest floor in the building, my room was noisy; not terribly loud, but I could hear traffic & people outside if my window was cracked open for fresh air- I live in the city, so this doesn't really bother me, just something to keep in mind- I can only imagine the lower floors are incredibly noisy. For a brand new building, the Elevators are noisy, I could hear a cell phone conversation two rooms away as I was sitting on my bed, the a/c & heating unit was freakishly loud, so I just turned it OFF completely, as it was a cool night in NYC & the windows & building have really bad soundproofing. Housekeeping was very loud around 9am outside of my room. None of this ruined my stay, but the hotel has really poor insulation to block the noise, which is really unfortunate for a new building.Also, the restaurant is closed, so the hotel is offering a light Continental breakfast in the lobby- the selection when I arrived around 9:45a was really low- a few pastries, yogurt, & a few pieces of whole fruit with half filled carafes of juice. The Danish I had was quite good! The hotel has no room service right now, but providing menus from local neighborhood restaurants for delivery service. The mini bar was decent, with all items reasonably priced.Overall, I'm glad I stayed at The Nolitan- I really adored my room & loved the hardwood floors, the incredible bed & the lovely rain shower! It was a room that I really didn't want to leave, as I love clean, modern lines that were used in the hotel. The only negative towards the hotel in my opinion was the lack of soundproofing- otherwise, a cool, cute hotel in an amazing part of NYC!","New York City, New York","patrickwNewYork_NY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",58,5.0

At first, upon arrival, I thought we had entered a glorified hostel. It was nighttime and dark. The hallways are stark and there's lots of concrete. BUT, by the next morning I was pretty much enamored with our hotel. The designers did their best to make good use of the space and keep the rooms feeling as airy as possible considering how tiny most NYC hotel rooms are in general. I believe all rooms have large glass windows facing into the city. The shower has a wall of glass that looks into the room to keep light flowing, but there are curtains on both sides of the glass wall for privacy. We had a room with a balcony, which we really enjoyed. It was nice in the a.m. to open it and hear the street sounds, let in more light and have air circulating, even if it's city air. My husband and I both really liked the contemporary and minimalist styling. We found it quite comfortable for sleeping and we did not experience any noise issues that some other guests have complained about. Each night we were left with a different snack or sweet, which we liked because it was not the typical cookie cutter mint chocolate. In the mornings, complimentary tea, coffee and continental breakfast is served, not that we every ate it-- (go to Oro around the corner). With that said, the cons: the desk space is not generous so I couldn't imagine having to work for any duration in this room. And, there's not a lot of storage for clothes, bags, etc. Hard to completely unpack, especially if there's more than one person in the room. However, there is a lot of comfortable public space in the lobby that lends itself to working on a laptop and possibly hanging out. An added plus is the rooftop with 360 city views. Right now it's not functioning as anything other than a hotel rooftop--no public bar, etc-- so it's quiet and basically uninhabited. We had a nice picnic lunch one afternoon overlooking the Williamsburg Bridge. The staff is young and incredibly friendly as well as helpful. I would recommend this for a couple or friends who are not going to spend a lot of time in the room lounging around but need a clean, safe, comfortable place to stay that's in a fabulous location. FYI, the wine bar next door serves great Spanish wines at good prices. I would definitely go back as long as I can get a rate at around $200-$250.","Annapolis, Maryland","SparkleTravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Annapolis, Maryland</strong>",27,4.0

We thought the bathrooms were well equipped and had a nicely spare feel. The beds were very comfortable, and despite the hard surfaces in the room, we all thought it managed the right degree of warmth.We got adjoining rooms on the ninth floor which was great for a family. We could close off those two rooms and leave the doors between the two open. The view east on Kenmare/Delancey to the Williamsburg bridge was beautiful especially at night, and the corner room had a nice view uptown. You should especially go up on the roof. They're working on getting approval to open up a bar, but just to go up there on a nice spring night was wonderful.The staff couldn't have been friendlier or more accomodating.

Here are my observations both good and bad:it's a new hotel and as such there are always gonna be kinks that need to be worked out - sadly for this hotel a lot of the kinks are design flaws and issues that are much harder to fix than training staff.first off the building is seriously fugly. I mean really, who designs these things? granted I was told the hotel sits on what was a parking lot (I hope that is true) and the strip its on isn't exactly gorgeous architecture central, however it kinda shocks me that such ugliness is still being built from the ground up. OK never mind, you can't see the building from the rooms anyways right?So let's talk rooms shall we? I was given a ""neighbourhood"" room with a nominal view of Delancey Street and the Williamsburg bridge. Outfitted with a king bed (very crisp and comfortable btw) a slim table and Eames chair, the rooms were designed, I believe by people who wanted the space to show well in magazines and blogs, but in reality are all cold and hard surfaces that don't exactly scream coziness or comfort. The room doors are magnetic and HEAVY, there is tons of exposed concrete and wood floors. Yes it all looks very ""cool"" and ""hip"" but you know what that means? YES - TONS of noise. All day and all night all I could hear were heavy doors slamming (the hotel was full), high heels clanking, stuff being dropped on the floor above and below and starting 8am in the morning a full compliment of housekeepers knocking, clanking and making all sorts of noise. NOW I am a heavy sleeper, but even I thought the noise level of the interior of this hotel was excessive. Like I said this is a design flaw that can't exactly be cheaply fixed. Speaking of cheap - the air conditioner was really loud and if you open the window there is tons of street noise (but of course being NYC this part is expected).Little touches were missed by the designers (who it seems have never stayed in a hotel room overnight) such as no hooks in the bathroom, shower doors that allowed water to leak all over, room safes too small for a laptop, chairs with wooden legs that were already busted (boo) and finally the shower had a glass wall between it and the room so that it was visible from the bed. Seriously? While this may be great for frisky couples, ""Peek a boo"" showers are so 2003 - can we please find a new bathroom trend please? This is not hotel where you can share a room with coworker or non-romantic friend or family.on the PLUS side, the location is great, the staff is SUPER friendly, outgoing and seemed to love their job, the concierge was a little fake thou... there are exactly 2 bikes for rent to cruise the hood (1 ""boy"" bike and 1 ""girl"" bike) internet is free and fast, as it should be and checkout time (for now anyways) is 2pm - very civilized.In conclusion I would say that if you don't mind the noise and all those hard surfaces and you can get a rate under $300 the Nolitan will serve you well, anymore than that I would say you are better off with the Thompson LES or Crosby Street Hotel which are closeby and offer the same proximity to Nolita/Soho/LES and are also very trendy.Also good for you to know is that this hotel will charge you (upon) check in: 1. the full amount of your stay 2. $150 per day for incidental charges. This then takes 5 business days after your stay to clear so consider yourself warned - I find this bit a little excessive and customer service unfriendly, but hey that's just me...","Toronto, Canada","the_real_bohemian</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",42,3.0

Wood floors, a lot of concrete surfaces and modern furniture. Windows are decent sized but a little high off the ground, giving the room decent light but a little bit more of a boxy feel than the floor-to-ceiling windows at The Standard or The Bowery.

The balcony, made of wood and steel, has a beautiful little bench, you could just stay outside for a long time enjoying the view and the life of the neighborhood. You can find in the room a lot of amenities, a beautiful umbrella, a variety of snacks, ultra comfortable bathrobe, beverages at small prices. The lounge and the rooftop are wonderful. The rooftop, even if it was February, was enjoyable, and offered great views either towards Midtown and Lower Manhattan. There are several benches with ashtrays, ideal if you want to enjoy a cigarette after breakfast. The included continental breakfast is very good and served in the lounge which is very cozy. The staff was great too. Very kind without being intrusive. The room services are good, you get a newspaper very early and delicious chocolates for the night.The location is perfect. It is close to subway stations, so you can get to midtown quickly during the day, but for the night you are already in the best place. At walking distance you can find a lot of great restaurants, cafes and bars. Many of them newly opened and crowded! Nolita is a really great neighborhood and it is the perfect place in order to appreciate New York, especially during the week end. There are a lot of other small details, difficult to explain, that make this hotel really outstanding. It will be hard not to choose it again when I will be back to New York City.","Turin, Italy","matsoc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Turin, Italy</strong>",36,5.0

Yes, the rooms are on the smaller side (this is New York, after all! ). but so very stylish, comfortable and well-appointed that you don't mind. I honestly didn't want to leave my corner neighborhood king--it was like a fabulous glass cocoon, especially on a rainy night. And I loved sampling the reasonably-priced gourmet treats in the mini- bar. And since the hotel opened last summer, the service has really blossomed. It is genuinely friendly and attentive, without being over-bearing, and the entire staff really strives to meet your every request promptly. How very refreshing, and what a contrast to the usual ""attitude"" and complete indifference I've experienced at other downtown hotels like the Thompsons. The location is fantastic, with Little Italy, Soho, Nolita, Noho, Greenwich Village etc within easy walking distance. The shopping is divine and there are countless great restaurants---Emporio, Tartinery, Pulino's, Peasant, Public, Epistrophy, Lombardi's Pizza--- nearby.

They support the local businesses and the soaps and toiletries from a fabulous store about a block away (Red Flower?) which ads to the unique one of a kind feel.

I recently completed my 6th stay with them. I used to stay midtown at more ego-filled boutique hotels. The Nolitan is my home away from home. The rates are extremely reasonable, and the decor is well thought out, but not contrived. They have a great option on their website of choosing extra mattress padding, extra pillows, etc. so that when you arrive, your room is suited to your needs. Evening turndown service is nice, and they leave you a nice piece of locally made chocolate/cookie, etc. Ihome in all of the rooms for great convenience and charging (if you have an iphone). Location is conventient to get to LGA airport, and some of the best restraunts in New York are blocks away from the Nolitan. Find a restaurant you like, and The Nolitan will order your food for you, go pick it up, plate it for you, and deliver it to your room at no extra charge (except tip, of course). This service, as well as the free wi-fi are my 2 favorite amenities. Another really nice touch is that all of the soap, shampoo, and lotion products are from Red Flower. Red Flower is a great brand of home products, with a Soho location right up the street. Rooms are extremely clean, some of the cleanest I've ever stayed in.The staff is welcoming, friendly, and strives to make your stay comfortable and enjoyable. Most of the staff has been there since day 1, so it's nice to go back and see familiar faces. If you are looking for an authentic New York experience, this is your place.

Upon checking in we where we'll greeted by a young man ""Ben"" from Liverpool UK. He was wonderful. Telling us about the hotel and the surrounding neighborhood. Upon entering our room I was pleasantly surprised to find it very Euro chic. Bathroom was amazing even though it was completely open to the room. Amenities where also great. We encountered one problem. On the 2nd night the drain on the tub broke. The next morning we stopped at the front desk and told them about it. It was fixed by the time we returned that afternoon.

It is not my experience that all NYC rooms are small, and so I don't think it is an acceptable condition. The Nolitan rooms are much too small for comfort. We were in 807 - a city view balcony. This is one of the largest rooms they have, and even at that is unacceptably small and cramped. Consider this list of things the room does not include:A sofa or other comfortable area to sit where you have a place to relax. The only option for that is the bed.A dresser to store your clothes - 2 very small drawers are under the bed, but are not nearly sufficient to store your thingsA refrigerator - to get this you must empty out the minibarA place to sit on the ""balcony""A place to store your luggage - the closet does not offer sufficient space to store your luggage, so they just become one more obstacle you will need to manuever around to move about the roomRoom to move - almost anywhere you need to move, you will be squeezing past your roommate Privacy while showering, using the sink area. There is no door to these areas, so if your roommate is someone you may not feel comfortable being naked around, it would be difficultA water closet door that latches, and thus was never fully closedA closet light that stays on, instead of blinking on and offThe ""inexpensive"" movies they advertise. $40 for 2 movies is not inexpensiveIron and ironing boardCoffee maker (a 3-cup pot of coffee from room service cost approximately $22)I am sure that there are other items I have left off the list. We were told that the room is 250 square feet. That must include the entire room footprint, including closet, shower, etc. Simply put, the space is much too small for more than a single person, causing annoying hassles and compromises that I'd rather not make and do not expect for a room rate of $660 USD/night. There are positives:Great neighborhood just south of Soho and right around the corner from both Little Italy and ChinatownThe staff (particularly Ron) was helpful in attempts to make up for our dissatisfaction with the room size/value, and with suggestions / tips on the things we wanted to do in NYCThe city view is very nice, no doubtThe bed is comfortableWe've traveled many places and are willing to spend extra for a comfortable place to stay. This is likely the least value-oriented place I/we have ever stayed. It is simply not worth the money. There are many options in NYC.

A lot of the details on the hotel, (modern and artsy feel, yoga mats in rooms, classy showers, try and get a balcony room) are all largely covered in other reviews. My stay was fantastic and it was great to see a new hotel doing so well. I wanted to take a moment to talk about some of the people at this hotel, who in my opinion, are what made the place for me. You can find other similar hotel rooms, you can't find another Ricky. Ricky: Ricky is the bartender. I spent two full evenings at the bar, just talking to Ricky, watching the hustle and bustle of the restaurant. Really fun guy, great to talk to, makes you feel very welcomed to the hotel in a city not known for its open arms. Pay him a visit, ask for an old fashioned. Tiffany: She was my waitress for one dinner. Again, helpful, and can be very funny if you let her. Tyler: Bar wizard. Have this man make you whatever drink he is experimenting with. It will be delicious. I had pecan infused rum. Restaurant Manger: Always paid me a visit to say hi when he saw me and made a genuine effort to be personable and welcoming. Front Desk Staff: Too many to name. I loved their casual regular attire, non stuffy feel, knowledge of the city and friendliness. Cons: The only issue with the hotel that I had was the street it is on, Kenmare, is the only street in NY where it is hard to get a Taxi. Genuinely hard. Taxis coming in off the bridge had fares, non that didn't would bother going down it unless they were leaving after their shift.

The aesthetics of the room are minimalist and attractive and somewhat high end, but the closet is very small and significantly compromised with the presence of the fridge, and the drawers for storage are nearly non-existent. This makes unpacking unnecessarily challenging. We stayed for 4 nights, which is too long for such a small room, but if you are alone and only staying for one night, it's fine. I would have a problem with paying more than 275 per night for this room.The location near Soho, Little Italy and Chinatown is a great alternative to the Midtown experience. Unfortunately Kenmare Street is a feeder to the Williamsburg Bridge, and on the Friday night when we arrived, the honking horns did not stop until 3 am. We also had the ability to hear the neighbors having wild sex in the middle of the night; the room seemed to be acoustically designed such that we could hear everything next door just like it was occurring in our own tiny room. This greatly affected our quality of sleep and only in retrospect is mildly amusing. Let's just say that during our stay the girls are noisier than the guys.The king bed was very comfortable with good linen. The pillows were particularly excellent. The towels were standard. Bath products smelled of roses, which is not a very manly odor, but was of high quality and pleasant. Water pressure was mediocre, and setting the water temperature for the sink was very tricky. With ordering room service, the person taking the order could not have been more gruff, but the food was better than good. The 6 items we took from the honor bar over our 4 day stay were never replaced, and upon check out we needed to recall what we took. Still got additional charges on the credit card after our return.This place seems to be going for the hipster crowd; if you are over 35, this might not be the place for you. Front desk was friendly enough, but ultimately pseudo-engaged.

The rooms are a reasonable size, the room fittings are modern in design and of good quality, the bathroom area in particular is very good. The bed was comfortable with a great mattress and good quality linens. Views on the room decor will vary depending on taste, the exposed concrete ceilings for instance are supposed to be trendy however in my opinion it gives the place an unfinished, slightly cheap feel. Other positives include the free wifi, the exceptionally well stocked minibar, excellent quality robes and towels. The hotel reception area, restaurant and bar are all very nicely fitted out and the service from the staff in all areas was superb.A very slight bugbear was the lack of conveniently placed power sockets, particularly by the bed/bedside cabinets.The BIG downside is the noise - it's been mentioned in other reviews and I expect shall continue to be mentioned over and over again. I stayed on one of the higher (7th) floors facing Kenmare street. I could hear people's conversations at street level, there are non stop rumblings from the passing of trucks heading to and from the Wiliamsburg Bridge and even general traffic is loud enough to interrupt peace in the room. It would be just about tolerable if New York drivers didn't have such a love of using their horns - as an example it's 11pm whilst I'm writing this and within the past five minutes I've counted 14 horns, sometimes a quick beep but more often drivers holding down their horn for several seconds. I've also been able to dance along to the sound systems in drivers cars.Why they have not made more effort to soundproof the outer part of the building I cannot fathom - I suspect either the projects architect was cheap of the hotels developers were being cheap. If they put this right (unlikely) this would be a great place to stay. As it is I'd struggle to choose the Nolitan again over other nearby options when wanting to stay close to Soho / East Village.",London,"Doug W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",3,3.0

It's stylish decor and location in one of NYC's hottest neighborhoods guarantees that. However, Kenmare is so noisy that I would never stay there again. Starting at 5 am trucks begin deliveries on Kenmare, and all I could hear was the beep beep beep of trucks backing up all morning. Other than the fact that it couldn't actually be used for sleeping, I thought the room was a typical boutique hotel stylish room. I wasn't a huge fan of the shower that has a clear view into the room and out the window since I have no particular desire to be an exhibitionist, but it was easy enough to cover up with the drapes.One nice touch was a little packet of discounts to local upscale boutiques. One less fortunate aspect was that it's not easy to come by a taxi out front and the staff just watched me walking aimlessly around with my luggage rather than offering to hail one for me. Otherwise everyone I encountered there was friendly.Alas, the noise was a deal breaker.

When I read that a new hotel had opened in Nolita I made a mental note to look it up the next time we visited NY. And so we did mid-November and had a wonderful stay.The staff is friendly and accommodating - not a hint of attitude. Although we had booked two nights non-refundable, they graciously allowed us to stay just one night when something came up and we had to leave early. The coffee I ordered for the room came right on time.The hotel is stylish, the rooms almost minimalist (with the exception of the views, which are breathtaking). The rooms, granted, are small, but so are most hotel rooms in NY. I loved the way you could look right through the shower into the bathroom.

If you're planning on spending time in the Nolita, Lower East Side, Bowery, SOHO areas, this is someplace to definitely consider. The hotel is very modern so if lots of exposed concrete isn't your thing, then look elsewhere. However, if your tastes run in that direction and you want to be pretty much in the center of everything those neighborhoods have to offer, then this is the place.The staff is awesome from the minute you arrive; as a matter of fact it starts before you arrive. I actually got a call from the concierge a few days before my stay asking if there was anything she could do for me. I asked her if she could get me tickets to a show I really wanted to see but which appeared sold out. She said she'd give it a shot and a couple of hours later called back and I had my seat! On arrival everyone was very nice and helpful and remained so at every interaction I had.The downstairs/lounge area is really stylish and nice and the restaurant serves excellent food. It is a little quiet in the evening so if you want your hotel to have a happening scene in its bar then maybe give it a few months for things to heat up and stay at the Bowery Hotel or the Crosby Street Hotel or the Hotel on Rivington. But, I am sure it will heat up because it's a cool place in a cool hood and probably just needs a little time. Two things about the restaurant/lounge that did bug me a bit: First, the bar closed at midnight on Friday which seemed a little early for this part of the world. Second, the restaurant stopped serving breakfast at 10:30 on Saturday, which also seemed a little early, especially for a town that seems to run on brunch. They really need to keep it going until noon.The rooms are small so be prepared. However, they are very well designed and everything seems to fit just fine. As to the noise issue that many people seem to complain about let me say the following: Street noise was not an issue at all, there just wasn't any. The windows seem to block it all, save for the occasional fire truck which, come on, is to be expected in NYC. The HVAC system is a little loud but not intrusively so; it never bothered me. The one noise issue that was a little surprising was the hallway noise. They evidently didn't use noise proofing doors on the rooms and with all that exposed concrete, you do pretty much hear everything that's happening in the hallway as if it were happening in your room. Of course, the converse is also true so expect whatever you do in your room to be played loud and clear in the hallway. However, that said it really wasn't an issue as it's a small hotel and there's thus not a lot of coming and going. And, I never heard anything from anyone else's room.The minibar is jam packed with good stuff, they have nice robes, T-shirts and even a yoga mat for you. The bathroom is nice too and packed with high quality amenities. They have free wifi throughout and a nice desk which is very spacious for work. The closet is adequate but it is a bit tight so if you're a heavy packer beware. Lastly, there is a killer view uptown (at least from the higher floors); you basically look out toward all of midtown.In summary I really liked this place and would definitely stay here again.",park city UT,"expeditiondaddy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>park city UT</strong>",156,5.0

My husband and I spent 4 nts here for my birthday, recently. Ultra modern hotel with chic bathrooms. Everything was very clean and new. We were upgraded to a room with a balcony on the 8th floor so we had a great view. Street noise level was acceptable. The bathroom amenities were first class, nice comfortable bed with very unusual romantic items in the nightstands! Chocolates on the pillows were a nice touch, so was the daily newspaper. Great location, within walking distance to main shopping areas, restaurants and the subway. The concierge Cassandra was particularly helpful in trying to get us dining reservations etc. There was plenty of security guys around all the time so you felt pretty safe.Cons: you had to get used to the loud noise of the a/c, luckily it was cool enough so we never used it at night. The hot water stopped one day and it took a while to get it back so we could shower. Obviously some kinks need to be worked out. Did sign up for the packing/unpacking service but we never received it. Assumed it could be due to our in/out timing but no one at the front desk brought it up. Even though there was space in the room, there was no luggage stand. The restaurant attached to the hotel was nothing to write home about. The reception messed up our car service a few times, it seemed a lot of staff did not make an effort to co- ordinate their duties.All in all, a good stay with minor hiccups.

While the wood floors and clean lines of the hotel just accentuate the freshness of this place. I took my boyfriend here for his first trip to NYC and after long flights and lots of walking he thought the place was perfect. The rooms aren't expansive, but in terms of NYC they were perfect. It was bright and cheery in the room, and there was room for us to lazily dump our clothes and packs all over the floor and still maneuver around. Something that isn't always possibly in NYC hotels. Moreover, the front desk was attentive and even let us check in early. Maybe she felt bad for us...we were sweating and carrying around daypacks.The doormen take a bit of time getting used to but they were incredibly friendly. The hotel may look nice but not once did I feel any attitude. Moreover, they let you borrow video game consoles, bicycles, and even an iPad (incredibly useful to look up nearby restaurant reviews, etc). The air conditioning can get noisy. But there is a ceiling fan that cuts the noise and keeps you cool. Trust me, my boyfriend is one of those people that gets hot when it's 50 degrees outside, and he was more than happy (during our August stay). I'm not sure if they still have specials up to entice new customers since it's a new hotel. But it might still be worth a try. Just head to their website and see if they still have some specials up! Without the special rate, the price would have been a bit steep. Since in my opinion, the hotel does lack in terms of view: we had a room with a balcony but it's more like a catwalk and the view was of some auto shop. But it is a great location: lots of fantastic restaurants nearby: Chinese, pizza, Italian, bars, etc. There's tons of markets and shops to explore, and it's in walking distance of practically everything. I notice that some people complained of noise, but not for us. I mean it is NYC there is a certain amount of street noise that is inevitable in my opinion especially when you're staying at a boutique hotel that has less than a dozen floors. The sleep we had was peaceful. The beds and sheets certainly helped. Not only was everything comfortable and fresh smelling, the pillows were fantastic. Usually my boyfriend complains about pillows being too soft and providing zero support, he was a happy camper. While I feel in love with their red cashmere throw. The reception on the TV was great. I was actually surprised at the image quality. Finally, the whole room has an open scheme. If you're taking a shower you can be seen from the bed and vice versa. It really made the room seem bigger and in NYC anything that makes a room bigger is a definite plus.","chicago, illinois","skim05</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>chicago, illinois</strong>",3,4.0

Perhaps because of its location? In this recent trip to New York, I was feeling a bit more adventurous so I picked a hotel Downtown. The room was decently chic and well styled and utilized the space to a maximum. I purposely did not get a room with a veranda anymore because that would eat up the already limited room space. I wanted a spacier room and I wasn't sleeping on the ledge anyway. So the Cityscape room with a King Size bed looking out into the Manhattan skyline proved to be an excellent choice. The bathrooms were classy in style and function and if you're into viewing the skyline while you shower, you can open the windows and just gawk through the open glass shower and watch the Empire State Building from where you're taking a bath! The room is very well laid out and the bed is super comfortable. The pillows are vast and having 6 large pillows on the king size bed made me not want to get up in the mornings to struggle having to explore NYC.The staff is not only super efficient but very friendly and accommodating as well. When you had a question, they took the tie out to answer your queries. They had a smile, they had a pleasurable decor, the concierge was perfect to a T, and even when they fumbled with my breakfast (and apologized for the delay in the order, which they later made complimentary because of their fault) - they were still profusely nice. And you don't get that kind of service in New York or in most other parts of the USA. They turn down your bed and fix your slippers (which I loved) and the Red Flower toiletries were a delight. They didn't scrimp when it came to toiletries as they provided the works - including 2 bottles of shampoos, conditioners, lotions, body baths; 2 bars of glycerin soaps; facial cottons and Q tips, razor and shaving lotion (on request without charges), shower caps, extra towels. The bars in the room were full service - from snacks to candies to sodas to liquor - and were not highly priced! And there were extra chocolates tucked in your turned down bed each night with a reminder on what the temperature and climate would be like the following day!There's free wireless internet everywhere in the hotel, there's free local calling and they don't add surcharge to long distance calls, there's the New York Times right on the doorstep of my room (even if I don't ask for it), there's free bicycle and gaming systems and even free packing and unpacking services (on request) of your clothes! They arrange for sedan pick up to and from the airport at a very affordable rate (as cheap as getting a cab but arriving in style).For everything that's good, there is a downside as well. The place is remote from many of the upscale stores in the Midtown Manhattan area. You needed to walk about 2 short blocks to get to the subway, which was a couple of stops into the doors of the Midtown madness. Chinatown is a block away and you could actually smell Chinatown after you step out the doors of the hotel. It's a relatively quiet neighborhood until the cargo trucks come blaring out of nowhere. The rooms are small (as expected), so if you're bringing even a medium size luggage, it would be hard to move about in the room. (Which is why you should just get a room without the veranda unless you want to pack and unpack outside.) And someone should go and fix the airconditioning system because it makes a blaring sound in the automatic mode. It awakens you from your comfortable sleep. I was lucky that I was there when the temperature outside was 16C, which meant I could shut the airconditioner and sleep comfortably at the very cozy comforters which allowed one to snuggle in.Breakfast is mediocre as the choices were few, but if you're not staying there for a long time, this should probably do. In short, this is a hotel that attempts to please its customers and makes you feel like you're home. It provides you with the comforts you're paying for and will take the extra mile to make you feel that you're king - even for a day or two. I would recommend this hotel hands down the next time you feel that you want to get out of the touristy areas of Times Square of Midtown Manhattan and just want to feel well rested in the concrete jungle of NYC.It feels good to be making a review for a hotel that doesn't put the brakes on what to offer to make your stay worth the bucks you pay for!","Manila, Philippines","Benjamin C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manila, Philippines</strong>",113,5.0

It is a solid place, but not the luxury hotel it claims to be.First off, most staff members (except for one guy at reception who seems pretty self absorbed) are nice and helpful. Welcome and introduction to the room felt genuine.Rooms feature a clean, tasteful minimalist design but are very small, even for New York in this price category. Very generously stocked mini bar at comparatively reasonable prices.However, several technical malfunctions made the stay hard to bear at times: Heater barely heats the room, but has the noise level of an airplane taking off. Main lighting frequently turns itself on in the middle of the night, probably because of a shared remote control frequency. Wireless internet is slow and requires re-entering of password several times a day. Noise level in room is high, not only from heating sytem, but also from street and hallway (no sound proofing whatsoever).Overall, The Nolitan is a nice contemporary place, but there is better value for money in this category in New York.","Berlin, Germany","10179k79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",90,3.0

There can be a lot of noise from the busy street outside but once the window is closed this is mostly blocked out. If you need to put the A/C on though this can be quite noisy too!! The provision of yoga mats and bikes & skateboards was great, as was the free wifi and use of ipads in the rooms! (on request). The staff were young, friendly & helpful and accommodated to our every need. The rooftop views were great but unfortunately the bar has not been set up yet and will not be until next Spring so it was just an empty space which was a pity. The restaurant seemed to have no life to it (we didnt eat there) but it looked very quiet and uninviting.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful, the overall aesthetic of the rooms and common areas were well designed and comfortable.The rooms themselves were a decent size by New York standards. The beds and linens were comfy and the ability to use the small balcony was nice since the weather was great. The shower is glass through to the bedroom so make sure you're comfortable with who you're staying with. The minibar is overpacked with stuff at reasonable prices but it doesn't leave any room to put your own stuff in the fridge. HVAC is relatively quiet. Window and glass block panels don't open but you can get fresh air via the balcony door.The location was great although if you're planning on heading Uptown, you have a farther hike up to Houston St to get a subway station with better connections. If you're looking for a bustling lounge/bar/ restaurant scene downstairs you won't find it but there's lots of options in the area.Two problems though:1. Traffic noise is a problem. Its loud, the street outside feeds the Williamsburg bridge so its busy all hours. All rooms face the street so there's no option to get away from the noise. The front desk gave us earplugs after the first night which solved the problem but it would've been better if they used triple glazed windows and better insulation around the balcony door.2. Their free wi-fi sucks.

However our stay was near perfect. First--the service was excellent. They were all very attentive and helpful. Our room was not ready upon arrival (3pm arrival) so we left our luggage and walked around for a bit. When we returned, the room was still not ready but the gentleman immediately upgraded us to a higher floor since the original room was not available. Doormen were all helpful We did run into one issue with the access to the offsite gym. At the time they seemed to be still in the negotiation stages with Equinox. We were able to use it the first morning but the second morning was at 24hr fitness. Both gyms were fine so it was not a big deal and I was very impressed how the staff did take care of it and came to a solution. Second--the rooms were great but not for everyone. They are small but for NYC standards they are certainly not the smallest. Toilet is separate from the rest of the bathroom which I actually prefer. Shower and sink are open--no door so you need to be pretty comfortable with the person with whom you are sharing the room. The rooms are stark but sharp--bare but chic. Probably falls in the industrial chic category. The balcony was nice as well but would like to see the addition of small chairs. Third--the rooftop was great. No tables and chairs but still a great view and a nice place to enjoy a drink. The extras--we took advantage of the free bikes. We had to wait a few hours since hadn't thought to reserve ahead of time, but it was well worth it and a lot of fun. The mini bar was the best and most reasonable I have encountered. Hendricks gin for $6, Boylan tonic water $2, St Germain (!!) $6, Piper Heidsieck for a fair price. Honestly, to be able to make a good gin and tonic for $8 in NYC is a steal. I would also suggest to read the hotel book in the room because it is actually helpful and gives good information about the area. So overall, great stay. The hotel gives you every opportunity to have a fabulous stay. We got the room at a very good price off a Jetsetter ($207/night) however if they continue to provide this level of service I would pay their current price.

Here, some trick of the space was missing : no place to store our 2 normally sized suitcases. We had to step over them whatever the move in the room.BUT #3 : Despite the bold prices, no little “gestures” or extras. 1 tiny little bottle of soap and 1 tiny little bottle of shampoo for the two of us, for 3 nights – none added over the days, and thus not enough for the last day. The sheets were not changed and became very crumpled over the days.

I had a great experience (and I must admit I am the typical hotel snob who always finds things wrong). The l staff could not have been more friendly, polite, professional and caring. The hotel itself, the staff and the neighborhood are oozing with soul. I was asked several times throughout my stay if there was anything at all they could do for me. They knew I liked the chocolates at turn down service and made sure I was well stocked each night thereafter. My room (neighborhood room w/balcony) was immaculately clean, beautifully appointed with nice threads, a cozy red cashmere throw, beautiful hardwood floors (instead of the old nasty carpets you find in most hotels), a comfortable bed, good water pressure with plenty of hot water. I had a clear view from my bed of the top third of the Empire State, Chrysler building and more. I spent a lot of time in the room relaxing. Though the rooms are not exactly large, there is good flow and they feel larger than they really are. The location was perfect. I loved being surrounded by delicious restaurants, charming boutiques, cobblestone streets and a very cool yet down to earth local scene. I didn't feel the need to hop in a taxi or on the train to get to different part of town. I can't say enough good things about The Nolitan and its staff and look forward to staying there next time I'm in NY.

As parents, we of course also valued that our 1-year old was so well received - no problems what so ever, rather the opposite as it felt as if The Nolitan staff were happy to have him.However, being so new, they didn't have everything down to pat and the actual service sometimes suffered. A few misses here and there (what happended to the fruitplate and our dinner reservations?) and a kitchen that closed at 10 pm despite claiming 24-hour room service keeps us from giving The Nolitan a top score but we're sure that they will work that out very soon.Finally, the complimentary Vogue, GQ and Time Out in our small, cute room (loved the hard wood floors and the Empire State Building views!) as well as the green apples in the reception made our stay even more lovely.We'll be back!","Stockholm, Sweden","msAHP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",3,4.0

There were many helpful staff members and I wish I got each one of their names to send a proper 'thank you' to. I cannot sing their praises enough for making our Anniversary weekend memorable. Five star genuine service at the Nolitan.The size of the room is perfect for two! We stayed in the neighborhood 'accessible' balcony which is 35 square feet smaller than the normal neighborhood balcony and there was plenty of space! Great storage space under the bed with a safe, too. Crisp white sheets and a pillow preference available (feather or foam). The splash of red with the cashmere blanket on the bed was my favorite and my boyfriend's favorite was the waterfall shower. There were Nolitan T-shirts for sale in the drawer and I had to have one. The balcony was perfect for people watching in the morning while eating breakfast from a bakery a couple blocks away (Oro). At turn down service, they have different pieces of sensational chocolate each night. Someone mentioned the AC service in their review, I happened to like the noise because it drowned out other sounds and helps me sleep.It was a must for us to eat at the fabulous Ellabess. We had their breakfast; split the two egg, turkey sausage and potato meal along with a large fruit platter (amazing), orange juce and coffee for ($50 including tip). I am sure everything on the menu was delicious.The amazing roof top bar may not be open yet; however, hotel guests may take cocktails up there and enjoy it.The location is the Nolitan is more than perfect if you like shopping, food and little Italy.

I think all the rooms in the hotel face north and have potentially great views. but most of the north wall of the room was either glass brick or the solid door out to the balcony. Only a relatively small part of the wall was a window. It just seemed like a very strange design choice. Why block or obscure most of a really spectacular view for no particular reason?Other than that, the room was great. I did really enjoy having a balcony. The room was small but very efficient.

The attention to detail was great--from the toiletries, robes, red slippers, iPod dock, to a red Nolitan-branded pilates mat. There was a turn-down service available as well. The bed was very comfortable. Aside from hearing some of the traffic from the street below, I had a very comfortable night. If you're sensitive to noise, you might want to ask for a room on a higher floor. I didn't really have a problem there. I had a great breakfast the next morning at Ellabess--a must-try!

The views from our room (and I think most rooms since the hotel faces north) are incredible, full Manhattan skyline with a great unobstructed view of the Empire State Building. The rooms are a cross between industrial and minimalist chic, full of nice amenities, a yoga mat, slippers, robes, flat screen TV, etc. Room were just enough space and had turn down service. The bed was super comfortable and we had a great nights sleep. There was even free wi-fi which for some reason I had trouble getting onto so the front desk immediately came up to my room and fumbled with my laptop and made it work.The hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance of most downtown spots. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant, Ellabess, which serves new American cuisine. The food was refreshing and seasonal for the summer. Service was attentive. Especially memorable was their version of the clam chowder, which is “deconstructed” and featured raw clams.Our entire stay at the Nolitan was stress free.

The hotel looked good from what I saw on line, but being there was far better, truly a unique experience.I travel frequently in Europe and this hotel has the details, feel, sensibility and panache of the top boutique Euro hotels one finds in Paris, Barcelona, Rome and Berlin. Virtually every accoutrement was unique - the soap, the cement ceilings, the incredibly bed and pillows with a cashmere throw, the free standing bathtub and of course the view of downtown from the room and a spectacular 360 degree view of Manhattan from the roof garden.The service was amiable without being intrusive - intuitive is a good word - and it was hard to believe the Nolitan has only been open for a couple of weeks. Free bicycles, a stint and the local health club and many extras make one feel well cared for and special.The location is perfect, at the epicenter of Nolita - with boutique shops (virtually no chain stores) of every kind along Elizabeth, Mott and Mulberry. Restaurants of every stripe abound in the area, but the best may be the one in the Nolitan, ""Ellabess"" simply gorgeous decor and wonderful food. The Hotel is also just above the heart of Chinatown, which provides a nice contrast to the trendy Nolitan pathways and the nearby SoHo megashops.
