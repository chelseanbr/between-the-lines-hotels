No scrambled egg or omelet option, no bagel/croissant and cream cheese, cereal, or other basic breakfast options. I chose the one of the only vegetarian options (pizza toast) and there wasn’t supposed to be bacon on it. The staff preparing the breakfast spoke minimal English (they didn’t even understand “no meat” and I had to google translate to Japanese). I found this frustrating since there were so many foreigners/English speakers staying at the hotel. The staff put bacon on the pizza toast, and I requested a new pizza toast dish without bacon. They were planning on just picking off the bacon, but I had to specifically request that they make it without bacon so it wouldn’t smell like bacon. The pizza toast I wanted finally came out and the tomato sauce tasted like ketchup. They only give hard-boiled egg and don’t make scrambled or other types.

Also having a 7-11 and Family Mart next door was convenient.Now for the not so good bit:The air conditioning was not working in our room and when we asked on our first night if it’s going to get fixed and when, they said they can’t fix it and for us to just open our windows. There was no compensation offered, no apologies about the situation and no explanation as to why they can’t fix it. They just said it will never be fixed. Luckily it was cooler during the night time, but the construction of a nearby building woke us up every morning & also had some mosquitoes come in due to the windows being opened as per their advice. Disappointed with the customer service. For an almost $200 per night hotel (not including breakfast), you would think that they would offer better service or just get the air conditioning working.

The Family Mart kombini is immediately at the exit. On the ground floor you will also find an Italian bar-restaurant that I have not tried (I certainly did not like eating Italian in Japan, but it can be handy if you need something). The room was very spacious (by Japanese standards): we managed to make us stay the two suitcases open, to move in two without problems, support everything on the practical table. Comfortable bed for two people (it was French, but not too tight). Available: slippers, basic yukata like pajamas, hairdryer, toothbrush (which was changed every night!), Good products for the shower, water, kettle and two very good sachets of coffee every day. We stayed on the 6th floor of 7, very close to a useful ice dispenser, beer and fresh drinks.

Some staff do not understand nuance and must have been instructed to be forceful when speaking English. A receptionist scolded me in English in an inappropriately loud voice and with an exaggerated facial expression when I asked him to call a taxi one hour before my scheduled departure! Whether I had asked for a taxi within one hour or in ten minutes, his delivery was very offensive and unprofessional. Another receptionist whose English must have been limited, firmly and unequivocally told me she could not order a taxi for me (because it was during rush hour and apparently impossible). Rather than offer alternatives or an apology, her firm denial came across as rude (even to my Japanese friend who I shared my experience with). Not a deal breaker, but just be aware of this hotel's staff's English limitations.",,Pauline T,0,4.0

No view, no air , not a great combo.Location is OK, but up a reasonable hill and a good 5-10 minute walk from the station. The Excel which I stayed at last year has the best location in Shibuya.

Before I write any further, I must say that the location of this hotel is remarkable. You have seven eleven on one side and family mart on the other. So you don't have worry about if you have late night hunger pangs or massive cravings for midnight beers. Though, the hotel is situated on a less crowded street but it's not far from the happening area. Walk roughly 200 meters and you would get to experience the late night vibe of Shibuya. So staying in this hotel becomes a real deal as you can sleep well in a quite area after enjoying all the late night madness in the back streets. Believe me, Shibuya's night life is immaculate, it is full of restaurants, pubs, karaokes, shopping, 24/7 shops and almost every thing a traveller would love to have. Coming to the room part, the room I stayed in was of a decent size. Even if you call it small, believe me , you haven't seen what small is meant in Tokyo. It was utterly clean and from shampoos to tooth brush it had almost everything. The only downside was it didn't have a big window that could open toward the roadside so that we could enjoy the great view and breath the fresh air. Anyways, it didn't bother us much as we hardly stayed in the room. We only came to the room to get some quick sleep. The hotel has a lot of good restaurants & cafés in its close vicinity. I am a vegetarian and it can be a bit of a challenge to grab a bite of my liking in Tokyo. But thanks to MOS BURGER ( joint next door) I could have my soya patty burger. I thoroughly enjoyed it and delicious is the word for the burger and chips I tasted. There are many bakeries around where you can enjoy scrumptious cheesecakes and hot coffees. Let's talk about prices that this hotel exhibits on different broadcasting channels. I recommend grabbing a deal on makemytrip, booking .com, or on any similar portals disseminating information for tourist destinations & accommodations definitely works out the best. The prices do not burn a hole in your pocket if you book it a week before you plan to travel. Comparing it with other hotels in Tokyo, the kind of overall package ( location, service, room size) this hotel provides, it is very reasonably priced. Overall, I loved my stay here. I would love to stay here again whenever I visit Tokyo next. For now I would say Keep up the good work guys. You made my stay beautiful.

Good Location, although it is a 15min walk from Shibuya station to the hotel, ladies might take longer than this to reach the hotel as there are shopping malls like 109, 0101, Zara, Loft, etc along the way. Surrounded by good cafes. 1 min walk from the right is the famous Ivorish French Toast Restaurant from Fukuoka, about 3 min walk is the Disney Store, next to the Disney Store is a building worth exploring. They have lots of fantastic restaurants from 7th floor upwards. Friendly staff who tried their best to answer our queries. Definitely will come back again.","Singapore, Singapore","SoHengHeng</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",69,5.0

It’s not only ideally located in the heart of Shibuya but it’s also an oasis of calm in the heat of that neighborhood. It’s the ideal location to stay for tourism, whenever you travel on your own or with your family. You are 5 minutes walk from Shibuya Station with the JR Yamanote Line the most important tube line in Tokyo or the NARITA Express train to Narita Airport, a direct train from and to Narita, very convenient once again.From Shibuya Station you are 12 minutes commute from Shinagawa Station where you can easily take a Shinkansen to Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima…The staff of the hotel is extremely helpful and very kind to do everything possible to make you feel at ease and satisfied. A smily face will greet you every morning.I have been travelling in a lot of countries and hotels over the last few years and in my home country France or our neighbors Italy they would have a lot to learn from Shibuya Tobu Hotel when it comes to hosting. The rooms have a decent size considering the fact that once again you are in the heart of Tokyo and very important: They are always clean. Since this April 2015 I had the nice surprise to learn that you have now free wi-fi in the bedrooms which is very convenient. Price wise it is very reasonable, I’m not over selling the Shibuya Tobu Hotel but I just compare with what I recently paid for an hotel in Brighton, UK, not even during the busy season which was ludicrously expensive. Other very convenient points: you have a laundry in the hotel and even a dry cleaning service.","Montpellier, France","Guillaume S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montpellier, France</strong>",13,5.0

It was also close to many shops and restaurants in the heart of Shibuya. The hotel itself was a bit worn compared to the other hotels I stayed in while visiting Japan, but then the price of the room also showed that too. It was cheaper than the other hotels, so relatively speaking it was what I expected. Comfortable, clean and quiet during the evening - that was perfect.

We were not disappointed, because for this location it was a really worth every cent.The hotel is easy to find from Shibuya Station (use Hachiko Exit, cross Shibuya Scramble and continue along the street between Tsutaya and 109 Men's department stores until you reach the fork in the road with 0101 City department store. Continue up the left street towards PARCO department store until you reach the hotel on your left hand side) and located amidst tons of small restaurants and convenience stores (my favorites: Saint Marks Cafe - Choco Cro for breakfast and MOS Burger, both located in the building next to the hotel - same building as 7Eleven).Even though both exterior and interior are a bit dated, the hotel offered all ammenities a city traveller could wish for (helpful front desk staff who spoke OK English, free luggage storage, ice and vending machines on every other floor, free WiFi in the Lobby and LAN in the room, huge TV with 2 English channels, small fridge, kettle and tea bags, slippers, nightgowns, hairdryer, shampoo, body wash, toothbrush, razor, etc.). Of course the room and bathroom are small, but that's normal in Tokyo. I found the room and the bed quite comfortable and it was very clean. It was a pleasant surprise that the room was really quiet even though it was smack in the middle of Shibuya.The only thing I didn't like was that they changed all our towels every day, even though they had cards saying that the hotel wants to safe resources, so they would only change the towels if you place it in the bathtub, not if you hang them up on the rack. Every day we hung/left some towels (2 small, 2 big ones) on the rack and the ones to replace in the bathtub or on the floor, but every day all 4 of them were replaced.It is good to keep in mind that check-in is at 2pm and check-out at 11am - no exceptions made unless you're willing to pay - and that there is no WLAN available in the rooms. We solved this problem by bringing a laptop and LAN cable, as there is a LAN outlet in each room.","Vienna, Austria","LiMo2009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vienna, Austria</strong>",104,4.0

The first morning a lot of the food was gone including the coffee, and was not refilled even though there was an hour before the breakfast closed. The worst part of staying in this hotel, was that there was no wifi in the room. The only way you could get internet was as far as I could make out, in the lobby on some PCs. We were not informed about any of this. We used our portable wifi hotspot we had rented, but the signal and reception in the room was very very poor.All in all, things that can be ignored because it was a cheap stay, and it is what you can expect.

This hotel was probably our favourite. The rooms weren't all that small for Tokyo, in fact there was ample space in our twin share room. A third person could have easily fitted in. The rooms were super clean, the staff always tried their best to help us. They even let us borrow umbrellas on the first day we got there as it was raining. It's the location that's the most appealing about this hotel. Just outside there are shops, restaurant, cafes, karaoke places to be visited. It's a short walk from Shibuya station and the scramble crossing. Being two girls walking back late at night to the hotel, we felt very safe as the location was always alive and bustling with people. The only reason this gets four stars from me is that wifi isn't free in the rooms.

It's so well located, next to plenty of bars, restaurants and shopping, and is a 7 minute brisk walk from the Shibuya station. The rooms though are very, very tiny (OK, I know this is Tokyo, but still), and not very comfortable. For instance, there wasn't even a cupboard to keep your stuff in. Just a bed, desk, TV, and a shelf to keep and hang stuff off.However, it was clean and had everything you require, including night suits, (long night shirts really) an electric kettle, and a hair dryer. They don't have free wi-fi in the rooms (only in the hotel lobby), but you can rent a wi-fi router for 500 yen/day from the reception. Final word: If you're thinking of an action-packed holiday where you only use the room to sleep at night, Tobu is a good option.

The rooms are tiny! As tiny in Paris but seems they swap the cabinet space for toilet space. Got a double room which is a snug fit for 2 people with travelling backpacks. But they do make it up with the spacious toilet (with a, surprise surprise,small tub) and cleanliness. Bed's hardness is medium but the two pillows are filled with some seeds at the bottom which might lead to some uneasiness. They do provide nightwear. The usual amenities such as TV, soaps, kettle and fridge are present but if you want a vanity pack you'd have to like their facebook page and show to the front desk officer. No in-room wifi and mineral water.The Service - Check in was not a problem as the staff understands English. They are quite helpful and will take time to explain to you the trivialities that is Japanese room. Its more of a self service hotel with ice machines on certain floors and wifi only in the lobby.The Location - Shibuya is a busy place with many shops such as Bic Camera and Tokyu hands around. The hotel is not located at these areas but up the streets right at the top of the knoll. Just make your way up from Starbucks for about 10 mins, past Kirin Bar and you'll find the hotel with a Family Mart nearby. There's Tower records to the right about a block away and Dannys' nearby for reference.  Shibuya crossing is iconic. Coming out from the Shibuya station you get to see the famous crossing where all traffic stops to let the masses travel from left to right,right to left, diagonally and horizontally.

There are a few cafes and convenience stores located nearby in case you need anything as well.Good sized: We got a standard double room, beds are 140cm wide, which is actually 3 cm larger than the standard Australian double. Room was large enough so they didn't have to put the bed up against the wall which is good night. In other hotels, between hubby and I, whoever sleeps up against the wall has a tendency to knee it in the middle on the night! Hubby had travelled to Japan before and was impressed by the size of the bathroom by Japanese standards (i.e. the shower wasn't directly over the loo). There was a bathtub with a curtain and a shower head instead. Clean: The hotel room and bathroom was clean and they provided shampoo, conditioner and body wash in dispensers. There were also some other amenities such as toothbrushes, razors, shaving gel, disposable hairbrushes - things that you would not think of really!We didn't try to find WiFi as we had our own, but I believe there was complimentary WiFi or cabled internet available in the lobby. Staff at the hotel were friendly, nice and spoke sufficient english (some spoke english incredibly well) to help us with anything we wanted.

Service is competent and polite, semi-double room is small but clean, location is FANTASTIC! One little annoyance is there's no luggage rack in the semi-double. Even this small and basic addition would have made a big difference in terms of space, as it means everything (eg two large suitcases, plus whatever shopping you do!) has to sit on the floor - and there's not a lot of floor to spare!You may not realise, but no more that 5 minutes walk away (in the other direction to where you will normally be coming from) is Yoyogi Park. A nice quiet green space, well-utilised by Tokyoites wanting to escape the hustle and bustle, do some exercise or walk the dog.

It’s tucked away at the end of the shopping belt, away from the bustling crowds and malls.The moment we stepped into the hotel, we were greeted by the strong aroma from the coffee house located in the lobby. It seemed like the coffee house’s kitchen has very poor ventilation. We were not allowed to check-in early even though the room was ready. Staff at the reception speaks good English, service was curt, and they looked tired even though its only noon time.We requested for a non-smoking room during booking but were given a smoking room as they claimed that it was all taken up. The hotel provides air purifier in the room and this really helps with the strong cigarettes stench. Room was really small and not much room left after we placed our luggage. The furniture in the room looks tired and dated. Only tea was provided, however, there is drinks vending machine along the corridor. On the second day morning I found a small cockroach in the toilet and informed the staff who apologised profusely but when we came back, the cockroach’s carcass was on the toilet’s basin. I felt that they could have at least returned to check after spraying the insecticide. Free Wi-Fi connection is only available in the lobby. Limited and uncomfortable seats in the lobby showed signs of wear and tear. Not a pleasant place to hang around for long. Service was also curt during checkout. The plus point for this hotel is its close proximity to shopping malls.

The hotel is 5-10 minutes from the Hachiko entrance of Shibuya station and easy to find; head for Starbucks, pass Seibu, turn left and walk up the slight incline towards Parco and the hotel is across the next junction. We arrived at 12 and were unable to check in but the receptionist let us leave our luggage and said we could check in an hour early at 1pm. We had a twin room which was big enough but could have done with a wardrobe and we had to drape clothes over chairs as there were only 2 hangers on the tiny rail. The room was clean, there was no smell of smoke, the shower was effective but don't flush the loo before turning it on or you get scalded. The bed was comfy and the pillow was a little hard but ok. The minifridge was ideal for storing water, snacks and the cans of G&T I'd brought from home to keep me sane! We had the buffet breakfast a couple of mornings which had enough western staples and Japanese food for us to try.We'd originally planned to move to an airport hotel on our final day but didn't fancy negotiating the late afternoon crowds at the station so extended out stay, at the discounted rate I'd paid, without any problem and the 6am NEX got us to the airport with plenty of time to spare for our 9.30 flight.The only negatives were the lack of wifi in the room, but we'd rented a portable wifi which I'd strongly recommend to anyone visiting Tokyo as free wifi hotspots are rare, and power sockets - there were only 2 so charging phones, cameras, laptops, etc and drying hair was a logistical nightmare at times!","Liverpool, United Kingdom","Shibamum</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Liverpool, United Kingdom</strong>",19,4.0

So we thought we'd check out one of the many internet places around (we ended up at ManBoo! Which I would recommend to anyone just to get a really cool club card) and asked them if they did printing, which they did. It seemed to be a bit of a slight in an otherwise great service.The room was a basic, generic Japanese hotel room, with all the basic amenities that you would expect. Wi-fi was non-existent in the room so if you are dependent on your internet fix I'd recommend going to ManBoo!

They have a few couches in the lobby and we're talking enough space to fit maybe 5 people.The hotel also has a restaurant which we never took advantage of.All and all I have to say this hotel was great and I would stay here again.

We bought a cheap air freshener from a nearby shop so it covered up the smell.The cleaning staff came every day way too early and even though we had put that ""do not disturb"" sign they seemed persistent to come there.

Book early saves 20%, worked out to be $100 a night (split between two people that's only $50 considering that hostels in the area were charging $45 pp for a private room).- The room is small but reasonable.

I've stayed at Granbell Shibuya before which is 'cooler' but it's smaller and more expensive.

Mainly to save some money since we knew the shopping in Tokyo would demand more from our pockets, and that got prioritised.They were nice enough to upgrade us since we were on honeymoon, so gold star for that. Only problem was that it was a smoking floor, and someone had obviously been smoking in the room right before we got it, and this even tho we specifically asked for a non smoking room. When prompted about it, the man at the reception desk gave us a spray-bottle, and told us to ""spray this, smell go away"", while firmly explaining to us that this was NOT a smoking room. We stayed a week at the Cerulean Tower prior to Tobu, and the service felt like the total opposite.We had bikes, and the old man guarding the garage took care of them every evening, free of charge. He actually seamed pretty excited about parking bikes.The subway station (shibuya station) is a 5-10 minutes walk away, the Yoyogi Park is 5 minutes walk the other direction. There's a lot of shopping in shibuya, and it starts right outside the hotel. So the location is PRIME. This combined with the price of the hotel makes the Tobu Hotel a good choice.The hotel is obviously a Business Hotel, something you notice by the lack of anywhere to put your clothing, or unpacking anything at all. But, you pretty much get what you pay for, since you can get away staying at the Tobu MAD cheap.... for people going to and from Narita with the friendly airport limousines, be aware of the fact that there's no pickup at Tobu. Minor thing, but you should know.Not very romantic, and the windows only open 1 inch, but very cheap. So if you're on a romantic getaway, make sure to balance out the un-romanticness with some romantic events in Tokyo.","Malmö, Skåne Län, Sweden","PontusMadsen</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Malmö, Skåne Län, Sweden</strong>",7,3.0

This was our first trip to Tokyo, and with literally only a few Japanese words under our belt (sorry/hi/thankyou/beer) we were unsure what we'd be in for!Luckily even though the hotel website is in Japanese you can easily book a room through one of the many English hotel booking sites.Before we arrived I sent a few email enquiries all of which were replied to with 'good' English, which was certainly reassuring for us. We arrived early morning well before check-in but comcierge staff were more than happy to store our bags while we went on our first walk around the Shibuya area! In saying that, the location of the hotel is excellent, easy walking distance to Harajuku (via the lovely Yoyogi Park) and all the sites of Shibuya (shopping, nightlife, restaraunts, train etc). The major train station allowed us to make several bullet train day trips (via Shinagawa) during our stay and super easy connections to Tokyo areas.As for the hotel room itself, each floor has a couple of vending machines offering alcohol and coffee drinks which is handy! The room while small (this is Tokyo!) was nowhere near as small as our expectations and accomodated us perfectly for two weeks. Noise can be heard from other rooms, but this was never bad enough to be an issue for us. Though it's worth mentioning you may need to switch the TV on if you're not interested in hearing all your partners bodily sounds while they're on the loo :)Saying that there's a desk/tv/small fridge contained in the room also.All in all we were very happy with our stay and would likely come back if staying in Shibuya again (the location of the hotel is a major perk). Also worth noting the hotel service was great, they even accepted delivery of our rental mobile SIMs that we had sent to the hotel and were very helpful for minimal Japanese speaking Australians :)",,beersushi,13,4.0

The staff told me that there were no Expedia rooms left...but I could see online that there was 1 room so I just booked it. They had no choice but to accept. $70 saved.Location- right in the middle of Shibuya. Minutes from the train station, food, Shibuya crossing, and a 20 minute walk to Harajuko. I like to shop so this was perfect- all the majors were just across the street. You can get lost for hours roaming the local boutiques on the side streets. It's true- the Shibuya girls have amazing style! I people watched all day admiring their fashions. The Harajuko girls also did not disappoint. It was crazy to see how ""they"" come out after 7:30...Food- too much to choose from! Anything you want is just a short walk away. It was my first night so I chowed down at the first ramen spot that I could find. Everything was delicious! I would highly recommend staying here and would come back again.

We stayed three nights and found it easy to travel all over the city to Tsukiji, Ueno, Ryogukan, Mitaka, Shinjuku, and Roppongi. It's only blocks from the station which offers easy access to subway and JR lines everywhere in the city. We also found it easy to walk to Yoyogi Park, Meiji Shrine, and Harajuku. Shibuya is a great area of Tokyo to stay in - there are restaurants and shops open late but it's not too crazy. There are a lot of upscale clothing shops, department stores, a Tower Records, and even a Denny's across from the hotel. It's a really exciting place to spend time on a weekend night when everyone is out and there are street performers around the station. The hotel was clean and modern. The room and bathroom were small - the room was pretty much just a bed. We were on the fourth floor and had only one small window with no view, but the staff were friendly and spoke English well and we weren't there enough to get bothered by the size of the room.I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable, affordable bed to sleep in while exploring Tokyo. It's a great base for seeing the city and the rooms are fine as long as you're not planning on spending a lot of time in your hotel - we were out in the city pretty much unless we were asleep and got a discount through hotels.com (Stay 3 nights get 30% off), so it was a really great deal for us.","Somerville, Massachusetts","Carrie M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Somerville, Massachusetts</strong>",10,4.0

Generally, hotels in Shibuya can be quite expensive but we got a good deal through Expedia and ended up paying less than $100AUD per night.The hotel is about a 7min walk from Shibuya Station (exiting from the Hachiko exit). It was quite tiring dragging all our luggage through the crowds and up the streets to the hotel, so pack lightly! I was surprised that the hotel room itself was a lot more spacious than the other business hotels that we stayed at in Japan. We had a non-smoking room with double bed, width was 140cm and slept comfortably in this. Room amenities included (larger than usual) flat-screen TV, fridge, hair dryer etc (all the basics). The rooms however do not have wi-fi and require a lan cable to connect to the internet. We did not have one but simply asked reception and they let us borrow one for the duration of our stay. The bathroom was slightly more spacious than other bathrooms that I've experienced. However, one negative I must say and warn people about, is that the bathtub in which you stand to take a shower, has no high-edge/ribbing, so if you don't cover the whole edge with the shower curtain, water will spill onto the bathroom floor. Overall the room was very clean, spacious and comfortable. We had a window room, but the hotel is located just off the extremely busy parts of Shibuya, so we were not disturbed in any way by the noise outside. The front-counter staff at Shibuya were not as attentive as other hotels - for instance, they don't greet you each time you enter/leave (I didn't mind, it was just an observation). Though they were very helpful (e.g. they helped me call up the next hotel we were going to stay at to confirm our booking - as I don't speak Japanese). As for Shibuya, you cannot ask for a better place to stay in Tokyo, if you want nightlife. Shops & department stores (e.g. Shibuya 109, Parco, Uniqlo etc.) are open until 9-10pm weeknights and a bit later on weekends. There are lots of restaurants and eateries in Shibuya which cater for all types of budgets and open until very late, if not 24hrs. Shibuya station is also very convenient for getting to other areas in Tokyo like Shinjuku, Harajuku, Ikebukuro etc because it is on the Yamanote loop, and the hotel is only a few mins walk from the station as well! We ended up exploring Shibuya most nights, after a day out in different areas - there's just so much to see. We found many hole-in-the-wall shops and eateries (e.g. if you walk up the street to the left of Shibuya 109, you'll approach a ramen store on the corner decked out in yellow. They sell ramen bowls for 550yen ($6.5AUD) and give you 2 free-refills of ramen noodles as well. It was delicious and comforting on a cold winter's night). Make sure you check out Don Quijote as well - a variety store which sells almost everything that opens til 4am everyday (or was it 24H?). It was so much fun browsing through everything late at night and then buying snacks at the end to bring back to the hotel.","Sydney, Australia","lionbeardog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",18,4.0

The ventilation is clearly better than on the smoking floors of many hotels in south east Asia.

We checked in and learned that we were put in smoking rooms. We asked that they be changed to nonsmoking per our reservation request and they simply said no. They did not even try to change them. Then we went to the rooms, and discovered that they were both double beds. One room was for our daughter and nephew and suppose to be two twins. We went back downstairs and asked for that room to be changed - again, without looking they said no. We then asked for a cot, they said no, but would give us bedding for the floor. The rooms reeked of smoke as did the whole floor. The windows were frosted so one couldn't see out of them. The room was dirty. The rooms are very small, but that is typical and not of concern to us.When I ran the water in the bath to take a shower, it poured out on the floor - from under the bathtub! Same was true for the sink in my daughter's room. Back downstairs to report this - ad the desk attendants said they would 'check it'. They never did and we had 4 days of a nonfunctioning shower in one room and sink in the other.We ate the breakfast on only one morning - it was terrible - cold where it was suppose to be hot, crust and stale tasting - whether it was Japanese or western fare.The price is not right - the experience was terrible - and we would have forgiven a lot of it if they were the least bit interested in our problems - but they were not. Stay at the Shibuya Creston nearby - beautiful, less expensive, and great food.

Like other reviewers have said, you really can't beat the location. You're maybe 5 minutes from the station (closer 10 with heavy luggage which we hauled up there and back without incident), about 10 minutes max from Harajuku, Yoyogi and Omotesando and only seconds from the heart of Shibuya. The staff were very friendly and communication wasn't a problem, with at least one person on the counter speaking English. The cleaners were thorough and quick and although the room was a little small by Western standards, it really wasn't a hinderance. With so much to see just minutes away we weren't concerned with spending too much time in the room anyway. That said they had a few English speaking channels if you're feeling wiped out from endless days of walking.We were on the sixth floor and the windows were frosted so don't think there was anything particularly exciting to see outside. There was construction going on next door but the window was pretty thick so it wasn't too loud.Also free internet if you have an ethernet cable - it was fast and reliable. We also didn't have an adapter for my laptop (three prongs) but they very kindly lent us one. As for wifi, there might have been some in the lobby but we didn't use it. There are also computers in the lobby for internet use - 100 yen for 10 minutes... so if you've got a laptop, it's a much better deal because it's free in your room.I've stayed in three different hotels in Shibuya and this was on the lower end of the scale (Cerulean and Excel being the others) but I really wasn't disappointed. For a fraction of the cost of the other two, I really wasn't disappointed. It's not a grand hotel, but it's relatively modern and clean and that's all you really need.

The term 'Express' is a loose one as it took nearly 2 hours to get from the airport to Shibuya Station. Of course we appreciate the vast size of the city but in a country that developed the high speed bullet train we expected the transfer not to be as long. If one of us ever visits Tokyo again we have said that we would prefer to pay extra for a private taxi so it drops us off right outside the hotel even though it is in a very good central location. To say we had only looked at the short journey from Shibuya station to the hotel we managed to find it quickly. The only problem was dragging a months worth of clothes round in a suitcase when it was 40 degrees and with 100% humidity. Its safe to say we had both never experienced heat of this nature and for me, who had also succumbed to a broken wrist 4 weeks before and still had a brace on, the 10 minute walk has gone down of one of the worst experiences of my life. A taxi will take you to the hotel from Shibuya but after an 11 hour flight with no sleep we panic walked. Seeing the hotel in the distance was one of the greatest sights we have both ever seen and as we walked in and the air conditioning hit us it was what we imagine heaven feels like. The man on reception was quite friendly but told us our room wasn’t ready, it was only 11.00 so we accepted this as check-in wasn’t till 2.00. We then asked if we had a smoking room, which took a while to translate and resulted in us showing the guy a packet of fags and pointing in the direction of the rooms. He then said if we wanted a smoking room then we could go up to the room straight away. We booked a smoking room, so glad we asked or we would have been done over again just like on the ‘Express’ Train. The room was quite small but was very modern and had good facilities. The toilet provided hours of entertainment, all we’ll say is turn the shower symbol on full blast, sit on it, then get out of there fast. Was a really nice hotel, with a great location and excellent value for money to say it’s a 10 minute walk from Shibuya. We’d highly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.

We got a good deal on expedia where rates were 50% off (so approx $AUD70 p/room p/night) but normally I think rates are double this. If it was full price I'd definitely stay here again if the budget allowed it, as the place is a great base to explore trendy Shibuya. I prefer to stay in Shibuya over Shinjuku due to the better & younger shopping and dining and general people-watching and nightlife, however Shibuya seems to have far fewer hotel options so we always stay some nights in Shinjuku (more a central business district, although also has a fantastic array of department stores) due to hotel availability.

I got a great deal on Expedia and actually thought it was too good to be true, but was pleasantly surprised! It is only about a 10 min walk from Shibuya Station, there are restaurants and bars all round and plenty of shops. The rooms are small but as was every room I stayed in Japan. Comfy bed (average pillow) but a great shower. You can hear a little bit of noise through the rooms at night but I think we had 3 very loud, chatty people staying next to us! I did not eat breakfast at the hotel so can't rate that. Would highly recommend staying at this hotel, especially if you can grab yourself a fantastic deal.","Melbourne, Australia","SuzTravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",9,4.0

You can easily get walking to Yoyogi park, Takeshita street and Meiji shrine- it's a pleasant 15 minutes walk from the hotel.The rooms were a bit small, there was no place to step on once we opened our lugage, but they were cleaned every day.The bathroom is also small (compared to what we are used to in Europe), but it has everything you need including a hair dryer.The staff at the reception was very helpful, they even called our ryokan in Kyoto on our last day to confirm our reservation.My opinion is that this hotel was very well worth the money we have payed and I would gladly stay there another time.","Denia, Spain","Miladd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denia, Spain</strong>",1,5.0

The hotel staff speaks limited english but after trying to communicate a few times i was able to get what i needed. When i first checked into the room, the toilet was extremely filthy and i requested for a cleaner to clean it but they ended up changing the room, which was even better, otherwise i would had to live in a public toilet smell room for one week.I bought 7 nights hotel room from expedia.com for only AUD$606 and was good value, as its considered cheap for a hotel and not a hostel.

We opted for the slightly larger size room as there were 2 of us and at the Sunroute we had to climb over luggage. For the extra aud10 it was well worth it. At under aud90 per night it was great value. The hotel is five mins walk fr Sibuya (Haichiko Exit) = cross road, look up for 'Lost in Trans.' Starbucks (second floor), pass Disney's and Parco and it's opposite Denny's! Hotel lobby is understated and subtle. Service efficient. On our floor was an ice machine and inevitable vending machine. Of course rooms were clean. Free Internet cable--borrow cable at front desk. All toiletries, night shirts, shoes provided. I don't know what people mean when they call it a 'business' hotel but it was perfect for our vacation. Quiet, clean, efficient. The location is superb - i prefer shibuya cos i like the shopping there better than Shinjuku. Room size was larger than I expected. At under aud100 including tax... I cannot imagine better value. It's my new Tokyo hotel. Tip: great habadasher (cheap and unusual dress materials) just past L'Occitane. Download maps on iPhone before you go.

Also, the bathroom was the smallest I have ever seen. It was like a prefabricated plastic room slotted into the corner of the room, which you stepped up into. The bed was large enough for the 2 of us, and fairly comfortable.However, although the room was small and we had to step over our suitcases, - it was clean. Other than the back of other buildings, there was no view to speak of. Also, it must be near a school, as each morning we could hear kids assembly early in the morning.The hotel was within a few minutes walk from Shibya station so close to the restaurants and bars in that area.

The hotel is well located for tourists and has good connections for all the main features of the City. The staff are helpful and friendly with typical Japanese efficiency and attention to detail. You ask, they help - you cant do better than that. Hotel rooms in business hotels are snug. They have every thing you need for a short stay but if you want to stay for a couple of weeks then you need a bigger hotel - try the Century Park or Hilton at Shinjuku. But they are very expensive. We stayed for two periods of two nights over a week whilst we toured round. Very good and well priced. The pillows are traditional japanese but the reception changed them for softer ones without any fuss. The lobby retaurant provides a buffet breakfast which is good valued and provides the energy for a business or leisure day in a bustling and vibrant city.

It was the perfect place to stay. A stone's throw from Yoyogi Park and Harajuku, it is in the heart of the Shibuya shopping and nightlife district. The location is the highlight of the Shibuya Tobu. There are a million inexpensive restaurants nearby, a Citibank (which is essential because US ATM cards don't work in all ATMs in Tokyo), great shops, game arcades, late night food, great bars, and a lot of nightlife. It's also near all of the Shibuya record shops (try Disc Union), and some of the hottest clubs (like Club Asia and The Ruby Room). The main attraction in Shibuya is people watching and sightseeing, and the hotel is about a five minute walk from one of the largest subway/train hubs. That makes it easy to head anywhere for visiting more historic areas of Tokyo.The room itself is small, but everything in Tokyo is small--trust me. The bed was perfect, and we slept very well.
