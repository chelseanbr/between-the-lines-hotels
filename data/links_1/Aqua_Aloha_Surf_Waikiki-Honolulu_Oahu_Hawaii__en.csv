Expensive as well for a moderate room, everything is relatively close in Waikiki so location was ok. Staff were very helpful with all my requests. It was booked through a travel agent and was staying solo so I also had to pay a single supplement which made the price expensive considering the facilities.

You'd expect when welcoming fellow Kama'aina there'd be a bit more Aloha, but nothing. They didn't want to be there. They also tried to tell me my rate wasn't Kama'aina and wouldn't remove the Resort Fee despite my confirmation stating it was. It really was a terrible first impression, and as they say, first impressions last. Also, their website states they offer Kama'aina a free upgrade if available - no mention of this either.Secondly, elevators were very slow - there are only 2, and one was broken. You need to plan a LOT of time; sometimes as much as 10 minutes, to get up and down.Carpet in the room was dirty. Rooms were NOT serviced (no towels replaced, no cleaning) as my stay was only 2 nights (3 days). When I inquired at reception I was told ""... We only do that for stays over 3 nights"". This was NOT clear anywhere, nor was I told this at check-in. If I was, I would have been OK, and would have realized I could have just asked for new towels.. but the lack of communication was poor.Also, CONSTRUCTION. Lots of drilling beginning at 7am. I was not informed of this during check-in either. Go back to your room at 4pm for a rest? Forget about it - DRILLING. Loud. In reality, I think they give Kama'aina the *worst* rooms.Admittedly, hotels in HNL are only for you to sleep in. They are cheap, good location, but that is it. I would rather spend more $ to get some Aloha. Will NOT recommend, or stay here again, sorry.","Island of Hawaii, Hawaii","MDTyKe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Island of Hawaii, Hawaii</strong>",34,2.0

We got great service from staff at reception and maintenance, whenever needed e.g. I couldn't work out how to work my room card. We also used the car parking facility, you will have a car space allotted. The room was very basic, the photos don't show how dated the rooms are. But we were happy with them because they were spotlessly clean and were serviced every day. We had the best night's sleeps on their beds and pillows each night, air conditioning wasn't noisy for me. And there is a room next to the bathroom for make up etc. It was the best value for money at Christmas time in Waikiki. Would definitely stay here again. If you come here expecting 4 star or to look exactly as the pictures suggest e.g. brand spanking new, this isn't likely to meet your expectations if you are after fancy hotel. But if you're after value for money in Waikiki, a clean room to stay and a budget to stick to, and a laidback chill atmosphere that feels like you are at the beach, this is a great choice. We regretted that we weren't able to stay in this hotel for our entire stay in Honolulu.

We were able to get a room at Aqua Aloha Surf. It is a good hotel- they have a hearty breakfast with Asian lunch food as well as good pancakes (we got tired of it after a few days). It is a great location and the service was mostly very good. They have laundry facilities in the basement, cold water in the lobby, and free movie rentals. The deluxe room was big enough for a family of four if you don’t mind a double size bed. We got the deluxe room that has a double, twin, and sofa bed. We didn’t try pulling out the sofa but it worked as a single bed. One issue was the noise outside of the hotel. For the first couple of nights we left the glass door open (prefer no a/c) but it was terribly noisy with a bar across the street as well as construction. For the rest of the time we slept with the glass door closed, and a/c on and the noise was no longer an issue. There is a nice place to walk on a canal right next to the hotel, and plenty of rental bikes nearby. Excellent, cheap food everywhere. Overall, a great stay! Room has a microwave and mini fridge.

We came early had to wait forever to check in and once checked it it was terrible the beds were kids beds for a double room.The walls are popcorn ceilings with cracks where the AC is, the use a key to turn on power in sorry that is not new actually motels use that type of service and it’s not eco friendly it’s terrible use of electricity management. The safe was old and rusted I definitely didn’t want anything to do with it. They have a PS2 games not included and not taken care of either. Two of the buildings are in construction next to them until March 2020or later, so the fees should have been waived. Because there is no “resort” nor is quiet because they have looversfor windows not insulated windows. The pool is literally the size of a king bed from 3ft to 8ft.

The very next day we checked into a larger well managed hotel on Waikiki strip.We got our luggage taken in, ideas of places to go while we waited in for our rooms and our numbers were taken down to text us when room was ready now that’s a check in service. We were checked in before 11am I’ll never forget that me and my travel partner decided we were definitely coming back to that hotel!

Suggestion: stop commenting and make it better. The room rates from now til 2020 should not be that high and for not being renovated.Also huge red flag when it literally does not say hotel in the name it literally means it does not need to act like one.

So we went cheap - and not so close to the beach. The area looks like a warzone because of renovation and building. The room was tiny which was not much of an issue because thank goodness we were only there for one night. The windows in the room are apparently pretty non existent because on the 2 floor we could hear everything going on outside - thank goodness the AC was so loud and noisy it drowned out a lot of the noise. The place was relatively clean - except for the stains on the skimpy curtains, the carpeting, the chipped paint, even the pad of notepaper was all wrinkled from something wet and sticky having been set on it. And there were things left in the refrigerator. The bathroom was old - even the handle for the sink stopper was all bent, and the pocket door did not shut completely. The front desk - the only information the woman gave us was 'here is your parking permit - put it on the dash'. We had to call down later to find out where the ice machine was, and when the breakfast started. The breakfast of course caters to Asians - along with watery eggs, mini hot dogs trying to disguise themselves as sausages, the only juice was what appeared to be Hawaiian punch. The pastries included some sort of cake, and the mini donuts you get at the grocery store. And oh - dont even bother looking for jelly for the toast - they dont have it! They do not offer any assistance with unloading your car - if you use one of their carts be careful, they wheels dont work right and the ramp up from the driveway is a killer.

On the positives - it is relatively cheap for the area, it is located close to the beach and the room did have a bed in it.Thats about when the good parts of the experience end - I cant speak for all the check in staff (so there might be some good ones), the one we had was just particularly surly (always a top trait for someone that works in hospitality), there is the $25 a day resort /amentie fee which is of course a joke as you have no option to pay it (just include it in the room price ffs) but this is a standard gouging across Hawaii so I wont blame this hotel specifically for that, however where it does get amazing is when you do look at the amenities - the gym aka ""Exercise Area"" which is a single broken wieder multi gym sitting outside the lobby, Im not sure if you could legally describe it as something safe to exercise on, Ive added a photo as I found it particularly amusing - note the fact that if you did roll the dice and actualy use that machine it is located almost in the lobby and next to the vending machines adding to the special ambiance they have created. The rooms have a bed, TV and bathroom in them, we were concerned the bathroom door was going to fall to pieces in our hands every time we touched it but it did manage to survive our stay (win!), the use of PS3s as inroom DVD players is an interesting one I guess you could look at that as a positive. The air conditioner definitely worked you had a choice of either OFF or MEAT LOCKER COLD, we chose to dance between the two settings throughout the evening to keep things interesting.A few reviews have mentioned the breakfast and they are reasonably spot on, the angry greeting by the woman cooking pancakes is a bit of a low light but then the pancakes themselves are somewhat of a highlight of the whole hotel experience so its a real roller coaster of emotions throughout breakfast. It is served in an Asian buffet restaurant complete with large fishtank and ornate oval tables which does make for an interesting touch.If you are looking for a cheap hotel close to the beach and can overlook getting any sort of pleasure out of the hotel you are staying at on holiday then this is a fabulous choice, if not perhaps spend a few more dollars and keep hunting around",,Ben N,27,2.0

Good laundry facilities and we loved the hire towel system. Spa on site but pricey, mind you, so is everywhere in Waikiki. This hotel was in a fantastic location- which did mean we could hear a lot of traffic from our room. There was a car park in the basement (very tight considering everyone has enormous trucks here) which is expensive at $30 a day. Remember they chuck a resort fee at you too- $25 a day to include everything you could ever want... NOT (free water in lobby, a newspaper, tea and coffee in room- ours didn’t have any)The staff weren’t quite up to scratch. Seeing as I work in hospitality, I do always expect a nice welcome- ours was far from it.

This caused big and unnecessary issues for us!! They also don’t explain anything about resort fees or parking when you arrive. I did hear a colleague say to the woman who checked us in ‘Don’t be so down about it, you can always try again’ so she was clearly having a bad day- which turned into a bad week for the whole time we were there. I did feel bad for her, however ...her bad attitude shouldn’t have been put onto me & her customer service.

The hotel staff were so courteous and helpful. Our room had two twin beds that were really comfortable. This hotel is not fancy so if your looking for luxury don’t stay here. But if you’re looking for great value in an excellent location that has absolutely EVERYTHING you need to be comfortable then I highly recommend this place. The room had absolutely everything we could need. The cleaning staff kept it clean and stocked with plenty of towels and toiletries. We had a refrigerator an iron with full sized ironing board a microwave a coffee maker and a big flat screen tv and a safe. Even though we were in Hawaii and come on let’s face it with so much to see and do we weren’t in the room that much but when we were we had everything we needed. We did have the free breakfast option as well. Again not fancy but you could get full on the delicious fluffy pancakes scrambled eggs and toast every day. They also had cakes coffee water and juice daily. There was also an assortment of Chinese options which my son really liked. The location was great too. So close to shopping Main Street to the beach and the bus stop. You do not need more than this for the price we paid it was a fantastic value! Thank you Aqua Aloha Surf!

Yes the rooms are dated that you cant not deny however they are clean and homey. The beds are so comfortable and they have the best pillows. Another bonus: unlimited internet so no need to buy data packs while travelling overseas. You do have to pay a resort fee of $25 per night which covers your breakfast, towels, internet and a shuttle to Ala Moana shopping mall. I felt this was great value for money. The staff were extremely helpful whenever we needed anything they were happy and accommodating of our needs. They have a cute little coffee shop inside the hotel and they do the best coffee! They also have a little nail/beauty shop onsite. I never used this so cant give feedback. Only negative was the breakfast. We actually only used our voucher for this once as we didnt like the choices. The only thing we ate was the freshly made pancakes. Everything else was not to our liking. Its more tailored to the Asian tourists. They do have toast but no toppings to go on it which is strange. Other than breakfast eveything else was awesome. If you are wanting a safe place to stay with friendly staff and brilliantly located motel (5mins walk to the beach an shopping) and you can look past the dated look then this is the place to staying wouldn't hesitate to stay here again when I come back to Hawaii.

For those who do not know how ""hotel rooms"" work in Hawaii, let me explain. The hotel rooms are considered ""condos"", and are each owned by someone. They are not owned by the ""hotel"". They simply maintain them and clean them after each guest leaves. With that being said, I'm very disappointed this time around. First of all I go through a third party to book, as its cheaper. The third party collects the taxes and fees. When I got to the property after paying over $500 for my 4 day stay, I was charged another $133 for a ""resort fee"". This ""hotel"" is far from a ""resort"". The staff are very very nice, I will give them that, however this is not a resort, its barely a hotel at this point. The lobby is okay, but has the same furniture in it that it had when I started staying here in 2010. Very old, worn and outdated. The rooms are no exception. They are suppose to require the owners to keep them up, and great condition and not to look like a dump. When I first checked in I was sent to 204, which was the size of a bathroom. Smells horrible and could barely turn around in the room and had no patio. They moved me to 609 with a fee of $10 per day ""upgrade fee"", however the only upgrade was a larger room and a patio. The condition of the room however was nowhere near an upgrade. With a king size bed that the mattress is broken down on the side and the foot, sagging and in horrible condition. The carpet is filthy, the walls have wallpaper that is peeling and ripped. The baseboards are water damaged. The lamp shades are gross with stains and dust. The sofa I wouldn't let a dog lay on it was so dirty. The tile in the bathroom shower looks like it was put in when the place was built. The furniture is chipped, broken and looks like its from the 80's. This is the last time I will stay at Aqua Surf Waikiki. I love the area because it is so close to everything, but I think it is time to start staying at the large corporate owned hotels that have better standards and requirements. Hopefully this building will get bought out and tore down for condos or something. BTW... the WiFi is horrible too!

The decor of the room we had was pretty bad and not a fair representation of the photos on their website or online which is disappointing. The aircon unit was temperamental and not to mention right at head height out of the wall next to you so we could not use it without it blowing directly on you when you sleep. The bathroom was in pretty poor shape and the shower was either scolding hot or cold, no in between here. They also charge a resort fee of $25 and I am unsure why when there are no special amenities.

No customer service other than tour information. Certainly no general knowledge of the area when asked to some staff. They advertised as featuring disability friendly i.e. personal disability lift as well as hydraulic chair lift for pool access. That's the only reason I booked this hotel and cost of course suited our budget and not too far to walk to beach with wheelchair, advertised as 3-4☆ on booking dot com. The lift worked once going down to street and never again during our stay nor did they bother to fix it or attempt to. The ramp out front stops at steps. Ramp in side says no prams or♿ disability. No wheel chair can get up or down the step to ramp that goes nowhere. I went for a swim in the pool which I thought I could manage to get in by myself, with aid of the handrail,however the top step,which looked achievable, certainly wasn't,which I unfortunately found out was way too steep and felt like it nearly ripped my leg off. The pain was excruciating. There was no signage to say' beware steep step'anywhere! After trying to ease the pain by swimming and moving about in the water. I needed to get out. I couldn't get out no matter how I tried and asked for the hydro lift to be available to staff in outside area. I asked if it worked,as I may need it. He told me ""yes, it did"".I asked for help. Eventually someone came,no communication to me whatsoever. Took out the battery after punching buttons. The battery didn't work. Three & half hours later(which in that amount of time caused eczema on my body and limbs from pool chemicals, i later found out)When i complained about the lack of communication to me or husband of what was going on,I was told battery needed to be 25% to work and it was only at 17%. All this time the battery still wasn't charged nor was there a spare. Throughout this period of time there was no communication from any of the staff. Only after I and my husband complained, to any staff walking by,and his, numerous visits to the service desk, to ask for assistance or at least some sort of communication,did the duty day manager finally appear. A Spanish guy I was told can't remember his name.His problem solving was ridiculous. No other staff assisted either. He preceded to tell me that they ""never use the lift,maybe twice in 50 weeks"". ""That this was a...(he didn't finish the sentence)that there's other hotels like Trump Tower and high end ones down the road etc I could have stayed at"". A full on discussion proceeded for about 15 minutes about the area and low sociological housing development etc taking place. That had nothing to do with me. After telling him i needed to get out and to get something for me to stand on as I couldn't get a leg up onto that top step as I injured my muscle when i got in. I told him to get a brick, so i could climb up to that top step. I'm 5'2"" not 7'. He asked if i got in myself and i told him i had as it looked like a normal step. I tried to check, to feel but fell as the reflection was deceiving. He disappeared for a while and brought back a wooden crate. He said ""will this do? Try it"" Which I replied ""you try it"". He didn't but expected me to. I had get out with the help of my husband and him lifting me onto it, then out. A risk! I was scared. It was a flimsy pinewood, crate that if my footing was wrong i could have snapped the pinewood and gone straight through. I that told him there should be a signage. 6 days later the crate was still there on the side of pool. The hydraulic lift into the pool hadn't been fixed neither had the disability lift to carpark. Or any signage placed there. This could have happened to anyone. There are other steps built into the pool wall, that kids could manage but not too many adults could. Certainly not disabled or elderly. I swim for exercise as I cannot walk very well. Yet they still take money for disability false advertising. There were quite a few guests staying there that had assistance aids e.g. wheel chairs n walkers. The gym is non existent it's one piece of equipment in outside in open space n weather, next to dining area. 7 hours people waited on 27th September,2018 just to check into rooms due to early morning flight. No communication again. Breakfast,(don't even bother,go down the road,it was disgusting with rude miserable and disgusting service)advertised as all you can eat,you wouldn't want to unless your Asian as its designed for Asian palate. Scrambled eggs n noodles which looked like a bit of onion or cabbage nothing else,spongey pancakes every day. Stale bread,n day old cakes. Red cordial instead of fruit juice. The only thing descent is room cleaning service. Even the transfer man was lazy,didn't want to lift luggage let alone speak politely or smile.

There were complimentary Hawaiian Tropic soaps and shampoo. Bath and shower were clean and well stocked with high end towels as well. So what may be lacking aestetically is made up for with these items of importance. The Aqua Aloha Surf has a pool, although world famous Waikiki beach is within walking distance.

It's not the five star joint where they pretend we are family. I have some complaints on this trip that I'm not happy about. I did the 15th floor for three nights. Construction drilling at 8.30am on two of the mornings removed my relaxation and I was annoyed by it. Very loud drilling. I did call the counter to be informed by an indifferent male that construction would be from 8am to 4pm. I personally think they should do the loud stuff after 10am. The first day my shower water pressure didn't work and I couldn't shower. Annoying. I liked the cagey house keeper. She asks you if you want your room turned over. This is in the hope you decline. Not normal for hotels. She does it in a nice way. But read between the lines on that work ethic. And made the room up to an outstanding standard when asked to do it.

It's like they threw a bunch of random Hawaiian-themed words together into something they though sounded good. Day 1 - we land at the airport and I call the hotel to ask (politely) if they have airport shuttle service. I was told they only offer service TO the airport and do not pick up. When I repeated this to the person on the phone to make sure I heard him correctly and he responded with ""yes, that's what I just advised you."" So we had to pay $15 each to a shuttle company to take us to the hotel. Something we didn't budget for. We get to the hotel and are told our room won't be ready for an hour, that we could stash our stuff, find some lunch and come back later. I was ""hangry"" at that point so that just wasn't acceptable to me. I muttered under my breath (loud enough for the girl at the desk (Fanny) to hear me that I was going to note that in my review on Trip Advisor. Miraculously, our room was instantly ready. Or should I Say our hole. It was clean, I will give it that- the first thing I do when I go to any hotel, doesn't matter how top notch, is check for mold, excessive dust, etc. Surprisingly I didn't find any in the obvious spots like the bathroom and refrigerator. The carpet is wearing thin, but no holes or anything noticeable. Then I started noticing little things like the tear in the wallpaper on one side of the bed, the chips in the paint in various spots around the bathroom, heavy rust on the A/C unit outside and filth underneath of it on the inside. There was also a random chair in the corner that was heavily stained with what looked like coffee. In the bathroom, the silver ring around the ceiling light above the tub/toilet is rusted and the towel bar is coming loose from the wall. The top of the safe in the closet is also mysteriously rusted when it's not exposed to the elements.I wanted to go relax in the pool after a long day of travel, but there was a notice posted that it would be closed each day until 4pm and be open until 10pm on certain days and normal openings on weekends. (this was Tuesday) due to construction on the outside of the building, but guests were welcome to use the pool around the block at their sister property the Aqua Bamboo by obtaining a pass at the front desk. Day 2 - we come downstairs for breakfast and the first thing I notice are various wild birds and pigeons hopping in and out of the room, and their ""remnants"" spattered on the floor. The attendant I'm not sure spoke English very well. She was barely able to get out ""Good morning."" Another guest walked in behind us and walked past her. She made some sort of noise to get the girl's attention and pointed to the little punch cards we were given for daily breakfast vouchers. She didn't speak English well enough to say ""excuse me, do you have your ticket?"" The guest is a far better person than I would be because I don't respond to grunts and gestures. It was extremely humid and the front part of the breakfast area was in sort of an open air area adjacent to the pool. On the coffee/juice station table, there was a juice dispenser that was some kind of sugary Koolaid style fruit punch. No fresh fruit juices. Next to that was a tray of bread next to a conveyor belt toaster and two big bowls of spreads - butter and cream cheese. Dairy products sitting out in the heat? Yeah that's safe. Walk into the next room that had permanent buffet stations set up. Again, no fresh fruit, bacon or anything a typical hotel continental breakfast would be. Now I understand there's a very large population of Asian tourists that come and expect their traditional foods, but have options for other guests as well. Not just unidentifiable items that smell worse than a wet diaper. Once breakfast is over, the place does convert to an Asian buffet restaurant supposedly. There was a selection of Hostess donuts out near the Koolaid dispenser and their flavor varied each day between chocolate, coconut and white powder and the bread changed every other day for toast from white to wheat. There were also random exercise equipment pieces sitting outside just randomly there.(expensive-looking equipment) I walked up to the front desk to ask about the nail salon that's in the corner and if I needed to make an appointment. I instantly recognized the voice as the condescending jerk that answered my call about the airport shuttle. I glanced at his nametag, but could not get a clear reading of it. It was something Hawaiian anyway - started with a K - heavy guy with spiky brown hair. I simply asked if I had to make an appointment and all he said was ""they're closed right now"" (well yes I can see that, the room is dark) and ""we don't take her appointments"" (well I didn't figure you did, I just asked a simple question). The neighborhood itself is sort of a slum. No problems, just unsightly. Fast forward ahead to our last day. We awoke to find the railing of our balcony wrapped with DANGER tape and a chunk missing out of the edge of it. It would have been nice to be notified ahead of time that this would be happening. The shuttle picked us up to take us to the airport. He crammed as many people in that van as he could get, it was like being in a clown car! We weren't told ahead of time there would be a cost (so we could budget ahead), until my husband asked how much. We were told $28. Neither of us had enough cash so we asked if he could take a card. He responded with a heavy sigh and eye roll and ""give me the card."" I will NEVER stay here again and never recommend this to anyone else. We stayed here through a travel company and they have been notified as well.","Salisbury, Maryland","Enk726</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salisbury, Maryland</strong>",10,2.0

Reception / staff We were surprised about the lack of hospitality from staff, right from the moment we arrived. Interactions with staff were cursory, verging on rude, and I don’t think a single one cracked a smile. Ever. Rooms The rooms are dated. On seeing the decor, my partner and I played a game - ‘when was this hotel last decorated?’. I said the 80s. She said early 90s. I think she was being generous. This hotel is shabby. There were holes in walls that had been patched and not repainted. The floor lamp - the main source of light in our room - was literally held together with blu-tak (see photo for evidence). It is the kind of place where you want to check the soft furnishings for bedbugs - we did. There weren’t any - it was clean enough. In fact the bed was very comfortable. Location Three blocks from the beach - a short walk, which is great. However the block that the hotel is in, that third block from the beach, is poorly-lit and dingy. I wouldn’t feel safe walking that final block alone at night. Breakfast Actually a joke. Like, seriously seriously bad. Bain maries of cold eggs, spam and a selection of asian dishes (noodles, vegetables etc). My partner thought she’d try a boiled egg - can’t go too wrong with that, right? Nope, there was a dead bug floating in amongst the eggs. There was bread and a toaster, with margarine but no other spreads on offer (one table nearby had brought their own jar of peanut butter to breakfast with them). Little pancakes (also cold) and one type of cereal - sugar coated. Avoid. Value This is the kind of place that should cost $50 a night. While the location is okay, for a relatively small investment you could stay somewhere much, much nicer.

Drive out in the evening and the lot might be full when you return. Fortunately, there's loads of great dining within walking distance. They gave me a video rental card upon check in. A nice gesture I was too tired to bother with at the end of the day. As others have mentioned, the complimentary breakfast was not very good. I wish I hadn't bothered. FYI...it's in a Chinese restaurant hence some of the odd offerings. They would be better served doing a few items well rather than offering lots of items done poorly.

Building work - Extremely noisy building work on the hotel between 8am-4pm, Mon-Fri made it impossible to ever sleep in or spend much time in the room. Our travel agent didn't tell us about this & neither did the hotel staff until we asked. Safety - We only found out when checking out that we weren't meant to go on our balcony because they were all unstable (hence the building work). This was written on a tiny sign on the far side of the reception desk. We'd spent quite a bit of time on ours.

Our room had a strange smell like that of tobacco. We wanted to use the safe for our valuables but when we opened it there was mouldy ginger. Yes, you read that right mouldy ginger. We reported this to reception at the same time we had to get our key reprogrammed as it had stopped working. At the time of reporting this, a young and obviously distressed woman walked into reception shouting at no one. While the receptionist assured us he would send someone to our room to remove the mouldy ginger, he turned to us and said, “don't worry about her she's schizophrenic and lives in the building”. Clearly sympathetic of those with mental health problems. He turned to his colleague and asked him to “call the cops”, perhaps some way of reassuring us.The breakfast was the strangest I'd ever seen. Chicken chow mein, cabbage and kidney beans was part of the selection. There were pancakes, some cereals and porridge oats floating in milk as well as the standard tea and coffee in polystyrene cups. It was nice to be visited by the resident pigeon during our first morning.Despite asking reception three times to remove the ginger, it was never removed. We simply closed and locked the safe to avoid the smell. The hotel is in a good location, however, the noise is very bad which I guess is to be expected. You have to choose between the racket of the old air conditioning unit or outside. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for light sleepers.All in all, this hotel is recommended to those with a good sense of humour. If this would cause you stress (as it did to a family member we were travelling with) then this is not the hotel for you. This is clearly a budget hotel and therefore expectations must remain low.

The staff were lovely and very helpful. We arrived early in the morning (8am) from the airport and were able to store our bags in the storeroom until our room was ready - which the staff arranged to be earlier than the expected 2pm! We took advantage of the international date line 'do-over day' and went to Ala Moana shopping centre to pass away the morning. Staff explained local buses and shuttle options.The first room we were allocated was an ok size, had a decent bathroom, windows that opened, A/C...etc. There was a bit of a problem with the A/C after the first night. I spoke the staff and they simply asked me to pack up all our gear and they would move us to a different room, while we were out for the day. So so helpful. The next room we got was brilliant. Bigger, quieter A/C, balcony, ensuite...etc. Felt very grateful that the staff sorted out the issue so promptly, and without any fuss.Breakfast and WIFI (in the room and in the public hotel spaces) was all included in the price. The breakfast wasn't too fancy, but there was the usual toast, cereal, eggs and coffee (plus many Asian inspired dishes as well). This hotel also had a private pool, and a small outdoor gym area.Location-wise, this hotel is closer to the canal than the beach - but its only a short 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach (about 2 blocks), and all that shopping/eating that happens in the Waikiki ""hub"". In fact, I could argue that it was better to be a little away from all the busy hustle and bustle of the main very touristy Waikiki Beach strip!!!It was pretty quiet location - even on the balcony - and certainly in the hotel, you couldn't hear your neighbours, or the lifts going..etc. I think there was one night where you could hear some people larking about in the street (but it was New Years Eve - so that is only to be expected!).There were a fair few amenities close by as well - a Food Pantry (grocery store), Alamo car rental place, fast food and other restaurants..as well as the obligatory ABC shops! So I would have to say the location, while not right on the beach, was really great.Overall, this hotel is not bright and shiny/ brand new - but it is very comfortable, well-appointed, good facilities and great staff.

However you need to expect the following, if you check in earlier there are no facilities. Facilities such as pay for an early check in, or as I doubt the hotel was 100% full there must be an empty room somewhere, so we waited for 3 hours to check in. After a 10 hour (no sleep flight due to turbulence) we tried to cope by resting by the pool. I tried to make use of this time by asking for the Pearl Harbour tickets I had booked directly with the hotel, I had called directly to make the reservation so would assume that they would put me on to THEIR concierge. When I learned that the tickets were not there and they tied to tell me that I had not made the reservation, I thought lucky I had brought the contact numbers with me, it turns out the concierge I had been forwarded on to was at a completely different hotel? How does that happen? Also the concierge at this hotel was not helpful at all in helping me beyond loaning me the phone. So with this disappointment I noticed during our wait I counted the growing number of people also in our situation (24) all with their luggage in the lobby. I had assumed (incorrectly) that the reservation clerk would serve us first (first arrival etc) when our room became available but as I listened to the multiple complaints of fellow travellers - just knew there was no chance. I also note with interest the exercise equipment that was outside and rusted (not sure if there was a room elsewhere) When we finally got to our room, it was on the second floor that overlooked the filthy roof of the lobby entrance. My first concern was security - the windows are louvered (the kind that can be easily removed and there weren't winders on all the windows so could not shut one of the windows). The room itself smelled bad, and the hotel safe was a remnant of the 60's - keyed and rusty. We were so tired we tried to sleep straight away (beds looked clean) but woke up 2 hours later due to the noise. The traffic is so noisy, so if you aren't a fan you might want to consider this. We also woke up with the heat, so tried to get the air conditioner going (note I said tried). The final straw for us was, a group of very loud party of women returning home at 11pm who were booked next door to us and kept up the chatter and laughter. So I made the decision to walk to the Hilton Garden View in the next street for availability. Upon check out the lady at reception wanted to know why we were cancelling. She said we should have complained about the noise and she would send security to check on it. It was interesting to note that the whole time we spent moving hotels, the security guard had not move from his spot. I was charged for the use of the room (fair enough we had used it ) but I can tell you the change to the Hilton Garden View was SO MUCH WORTH IT!. They were so friendlier, nicer and put us in a quiet spot and when I explained the mess with the Pearl Harbour tickets, they contacted Roberts Hawaii Tours and straightened it all out.",Gold Coast,"692AussiesAbroad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast</strong>",5,1.0

Aqua Aloah Surf Waikikki is located about 10 minutes walk from the famous Waikiki beach. Most of the staff are friendly and helpful. The open plan lobby area is spacious with plenty of comfortable seating for guests and their visitors. The free coffee and the water fountain are a nice touch of hospitality. The pool is small, but we did not use it, so unable to comment. The room we were allocated was smallish and without windows that fully open. (See photo).The furnishings -especially in the bathroom looked a little tired in need of upgrade sometime in the future. The room would also benefit from a chair to sit on. This said, the in room amenities were good, clean and everything worked as expected. The beds were comfortable. Breakfast is provided by a Chinese family possibly subcontracted by the hotel, and caters for Chinese and Polynesian guests rather than Europeans. There are 2 cereals: Cornflakes and Cherios. The milk for it is so diluted, you can see through it. The coffee was good, though, so was the scrambled eggs.There are no crusty breadrolls, just sliced bread for toast. If you like cold sliced meats or cheese, jam or honey, you will be disappointed. We bought our own.There are no waiting staff in the breakfast room, everything is self service and you are asked to clear your own tables (YMCA style). Just glad we didn't have to do the dishes.Pigeons roam freely and unchallenged around the buffet table. (See photo).Would I stay here again? Maybe- but in a room other than the second floor and with a balcony. Or I might save up a bit more and go for a more modern hotel on Waikiki beach.","Bristol, England, United Kingdom","ekupich</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, England, United Kingdom</strong>",9,3.0

I stayed 10 nights and upgraded rooms (to a superior) half way; the beds were terrible in both rooms.

Not sure why it's there to be honest.

We arrived at 10.30pm after traveling 25 hours to a warm reception from the receptionist and an ungrade as we were staying 20 nights. The lobby was very welcoming and nicely decorated.Our room was freshly decorated and very clean. Our lay/balcony had lovely sea views and city view as we were 15 floors up. During our stay I found the staff busy and very pleasant maintaining the apartments and always happy to help. You can borrow towels/chairs/ swimming equipment from reception which was a great bonus. We were able to rent out films for free if we decided to have a night in. The managers special was his own cocktail and lovely Hawaiian music, very informal which we liked. The laundry service was a blessing as we were staying so long, $2.25 for a was and a dollar to dry,you share the two machines with the residents so up early is advisable. My only three complaints,two of which the hotel can do nothing about is that the road is very noisy,it's a two way road and you also have the traffic along the canal,even up at 15 floors we could hear everything. The hotel across the road has a bar that's open till 3am and as there are no window you can hear everything. Not music,just very load talking! The last one is the breakfast, it's different. A selection of pancakes/ bread/cakes/ spiced onions/fried rice/chow mien/ porridge. I'm a boring eater so toast and porridge suited me for a while but a bit of rotation would be good and also food labelled as I'm a vegetarian and had no idea what some of the food was. Toward the end of the holiday we tended to eat out for breakfast,maybe because we had stayed so long it just got boring and if we went down at 8.30 it seemed to be the leftovers and the stale bread not replenished etc!!

The room served its purpose. We had a queen bed (requested King, but not available, supposedly - tried to get us to upgrade to get a king-nope), corner room overlooking the Alai Wai Canal and a bit of an oceanview from afar. Great location, 3 blocks from beach access. Plenty of restaurants, shops close by. The USD18 plus tax resort fee per day includes wifi, beach chairs, umbrellas, breakfast and some other things. Folks rip the breakfast but we did not mind it - there was enough to chose from to start our day and it meant we did not have to get ready and go hunting for a place for breakfast and the price was right as Waikiki is not cheap by any means! We liked the purified water station in the lobby and would fill up our water bottles to take to the beach and back to our room daily.There was a coffee maker with coffee provided, a microwave and mini fridge - all nice to have and we used them. A/C was off when we entered the room so it was stuffy but did not take too long to start to cool down and we kept it on throughout our stay. One time when we returned to our room, housekeeping has turned it off and so it took another while to cool down the room. Housekeeping did a good job until our last couple days - we never got clean sheets during our stay and our bed was made up rather messily and looked shoddy, like a 5 year old was trying to make the bed. Seriously, little things like that go a long way in guest satisfaction! I emailed Tim Clark, the GM, before we left and still have not heard anything back from him.He hosted the Tuesday Manager Cocktail party; the complimentary beverage was tasty albeit sweet. There was a decent gathering of guests and I was surprised he did not 'address' us; no words, nothing. They also served chocolate covered Macadamia Nuts as a snack - nice touch.The room we stayed in was in need of a paint job; it looked a little run down, even though all things worked well. For the price we paid, we were OK with what we got. Suggestion: If you have a late flight out of Honolulu, keep your room for an extra night; we were glad we had the room right up until we left for the airport at 8pm. It confused the front desk gal though.If the price was right would stay again. an afford 7 nights here or just one at a Waikiki Beachfront one!PS...

Here is a summary of our experienceThe staff (manager, room cleaners, maintenance men, front desk) are great. They were always friendly and accommodating.Hotel offers fresh beach towels any time you want them and beach chairs.This is an older hotel, so don't expect everything to look brand new.The rooms are decent, the fridge was great, and the room layout was excellent. We had a room with a single bed and double bed.The hotel location is great, just a couple of blocks from the main Waikiki beach. There is a Food Pantry grocery store that had everything we needed (PS I don't recommend buying any of the pre-cooked whole chickens because they tended to be way overcooked, dry and tasteless)The hotel has a free shuttle service that takes you from the hotel to various destinations in and around Waikiki which we used often.For other travel, we used the city buses which take you almost anywhere on the island you want to go. The hotel staff were great giving advice on how to get to various locations on the island.You have to be aware that you will pay $18 per day ""resort fee"" which covers daily newspapers, video rentals, beach towels, and the breakfast. Its not over the top, but after we booked the package, the hotel raised the cost of this. Truth be told, a majority of this cost covers the breakfast, which was pricey given the food offered was at the lower end of quality and selection. It caters more to an oriental clientele.

I was overcharged. so 3 emails, a facebook complaint and facebook message later, thwir heas office responded and apologised for the over charge and were sincere and prompt in fixing the problem. I was satisfied and had hope for the Hotel.BUT. it is now Thursday, I checked out Sunday, and low and behold, they STILL have a hold on my credit card of $275, meaning, I can not use my money till they release the hold. and why such a big hold? I have been charged for the room, paid for the room in full, refund of overcharge has gone through, but you now want to hold back my $275 which is $380 Australian dollars. this while experience is un acceptable and un professional. I was willing to let my anger go when they fixed the over charge. But still having a hold of my money, mixed with rude staff who do not want to speak or be friendly to guests at check in desks and do not seem to know what they are charging. im disgusted in this hotel. It would take some amazing offer and the staff to lift their apirits and be nicer to your guests before I ever consider staying here again.As i said, rooms are decent and clean and in a good location. But if you do not want to have to fight for your money or deal with rude staff, id spend your money elsewhere.Thank you to to the staff who were so kind in fixing the over charge. but 2 monewy problems from a 2 night stay has ruined what I hoped would be a decent review for you.","Leumeah, Australia","Nellemk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leumeah, Australia</strong>",6,2.0

Hotel is close to the beach (no more than a 5 minute walk), and very close to restaurants, shops, (international marketplace), bars, etc. If you like noodles, you must check out Marukame Udon. Amazing noodles for cheap. The line is usually out the door, but it goes fairly quickly. Definitely check this place out. Hotel provides beach towels and chairs for free. Rooms are out dated, but clean. ACs are window units and very loud (this is probably my biggest con). If you have a room facing the back of the hotel, you are directly facing a not so nice looking apartment complex. There is a very small pool, however I never used it as the beach was so close. There is a small bar attached to the lobby. There is also a decent bar directly across the street at the Sand Villa Hotel, which also has decent food. Staff are very friendly. They can book tours for you around the island. I did the Pearl Harbor tour which worked out well and as advertised. Diamond Head is only about a 15 minute bus ride from the hotel. (only $2.50 round trip). Bus stop is only one block away (take the 23 or 2 bus). All in all, not that bad of a hotel for the area.

Pros; the hotel is downtown, a short walk to the beach and tons of restaurants. There are about 30 ABC convenience stores within walking distance. The staff are friendly and do their best to accommodate. Th y are the positive in this review. There is a 'continental breakfast'...., Cons; the street side of the hotel is LOUD. Not just a little loud, but RIDICULOUSLY loud. Even on the 8th floor - we were woken up nightly by the sounds of cars, police sirens, arguing drunks - blaring music from the parking lot next door. Buying ear plus did not help. It's not a safe spot to walk late at night, many transients. The parking fee is $25 PER DAY, the 'resort' fee is $18, which I think is excessive for this hotel. For the added resort fees you are paying, this breakfast should be a LOT better. You are better off grabbing packaged foods at ABC or walking a block to a restaurant. Some of this is kinda typical of downtown Waikiki, other things like the security / noise could be addressed by the resort. All in all, try to use the cheaper parking lots a few blocks down to save $$$. Be aware of your surroundings at night. You will save money here - but don't expect a Hilton experience. ",,Jax F,1,3.0

There is an additional and mandatory resort fee of $15 per night which gives you access to WiFi, DVD rentals, coffee, pool, pool/beach towels and other amenities.

Room looked a bit old and worn down but was mostly clean. It was spacious enough but was missing any chairs or sofa to relax and sit on. Also no tables to eat or write on. Windows were louvre style and provided absolutely no noise insulation from the street traffic below. Pack your ear plugs if you want a peaceful sleep. The double bed mattress had gotten noticeably softer on the other side.Bathroom was ok but the shower area had a bit rusty appearance. The shower was in a bath tub.

The balcony had a nice view to the canal and city. There was also a microwave, coffee maker, TV and decent side refrigerator provided, which was nice. Housekeeping kept the room clean and tidy.Breakfast 1/5:Worst breakfast buffet I have ever eaten. It seemed more like a cheap Chinese lunch than the continental breakfast advertised. No bacon, no proper bread, no ham, no cheese... One type of juice was provided each day and tasted very watery and fake. The pancakes were ok.The breakfast area looked dull and smelled weird. Lady at the front checking breakfast passes looked grumpy all the time and didn't speak English very well. Utensils and plates had to be checked every time for dirty spots.

What brings me back is the price and only the price. I find that most hotel rooms in Waikiki are pretty much the same, the only main variance is the price and that mainly being dictated by the distance to the beach. A shower is a shower, a bed is a bed. Price doesn't guarantee mattress age or quality. I have been in a lot of hotels and a room is a room. You have to ask yourself what your needs are and how much you are willing to pay to have them met. Like airlines, hotels create an artificial value system based on very little. Ocean views? How long will you spend looking at those? Just go to the beach. Closeness to the beach? Most are a short walk from the beach. A taxi ride to and from the beach will probably cost you $20 a day. Compare that to your room price.Aqua Aloha Surf is great value for money. There is a free courtesy bus, which used judiciously can get you within a short walk of most places. It runs a loop around Waikiki and out to Ala Moana Shopping Center. The loop takes approximately 30 mins. Tip the driver $1 or more per passenger every trip and he will probably drop you off just about anywhere along the route. The free breakfast buffet is not bad but not great. It consists mainly of toast, pancakes, eggs (boiled and scrambled), spam, sausages, noodles, cupcakes, oranges, apples, coffee, etc. Everything is made on the cheap. My best advice is bring spreads for your toast as there is none. Bring milk as the milk supplied is powdered and watery. The syrup for the pancakes is watery also. Share what you bring with those around you and you will have friends for life. The free bus will drop and pick you up from Walmart or Don Quijote to get groceries on the cheap. PLEASE NOTE.....the buffet is well timed by the hotel to have only a few guests, being 7-9am. This is important because if you are using tour buses to do a ""circle island tour"", ""Pearl Harbour tour"", trip to Kualoa Ranch, etc they all leave prior to 7am. The hotel knows this! So no free breakfast for you.The most annoying part of this hotel is the loudness of the door locking mechanisms when closing. A minor irritation during the day can be very sleep disruptive at night for lighter sleepers. My room was adjacent the fire exit (902) with a smoker in the room next door that kept on popping out all night for a quick fix. Bang, bang, bang all night long.The hotel is reasonably maintained and everything is fresh and clean. The staff are average, not excessively rude but not attentive to service either. This hotel is average all the way with a cheap price. To get a cheaper price search with a third party provider, get their price then ring up the hotel and ask for a cheaper price if you go directly through the hotel. The hotel has to pay the third party provider a percentage so often you will get a discount and the hotel will actually make a larger profit.To get top class service as you do sometimes at the pricier hotels just tip the staff. Treat them well and they will do the same. Learn their names. A small amount of kindness and a little money will see you treated like royalty and cost you less than a more expensive hotel overall.",,Jason R,30,4.0

The breakfast could use a little help though. They need to learn to cook eggs! Being someone who needs protein, and cannot eat just pastries or toast for breakfast, it was a bit lacking. But there are tons of places nearby to get a decent breakfast. This hotel is close enough to everything and we just walked everywhere. No need to rent a car if you plan on staying in the Waikiki area. And Uber has a pretty good presence should you need transportation anywhere. The staff here is pretty great. We were on our honeymoon and they gave us a bottle of champagne and chocolates when we checked in. Nice touch! They have a meet-n-greet thing in Tuesday nights with a complimentary cocktail and a chance to meet the staff and manager.

The rooms are a bit dated, but that's not a very big issue for me. It's clean and that's what matters the most. But at arrival us was told to pay an 18 dollar extra fee per day above the hotelfee we allready payed extra. I'm still wondering what I got for that extra money. Also to park our car in the hotel parking lot we had to pay 25 dollar a day. I think that's a brutal price concidering the hotel with all it's fee's isn't very cheap at all. That's allmost the price I rented the car for!!The breakfast area needs a serious make over. It's like it's not a part of the hotel and the ambience is very strange.

However no issues and I am not necessarily insulting, just warning you. I didn't like that but as long as they don't cause a scene or get my child's attention I just ignore them.Saw a scaffold and some dirty guests.There is homeless people everywhere in Hawaii but I noticed a few outside of this hotel hanging out in the public parking lot beside it, also men and women possibly working some deals.......more than twice with suspicious behaviour. However I minded my own business. No taking chances with a child.Don't expect anything fancy or modern, bathroom and kitchennettee area are outdated, cheap, rusty and not very clean. The rust I understand as it is humid climate, the mildew is gross but I clean it before using and sanitize everything. The old is fine as long as it works.The gym is three broken pieces of equipment in the corner back of the lobby. It's a safety hazard, zapped strapped to keep some things together. It's garbage.The uglyOh boy! The continental breakfast is the worst I have ever seen but to be fair the fresh off the grill mini pancakes were nice to have.If you like Chinese food for breakfast you will love it. There's a mini Chinese food including fried rice every morning. I just couldn't but looked alright.As they do have all you can eat in the day I was too afraid it might just be left overs from the night beforeThere was scrambled eggs and hard boiled eggs as well as bread and some cakes and powdered mini doughnuts.Now, the coffee was cheap coffeeThe tea was so watered down, didn't even taste like teaThe milk was powdered milk, how cheap!The juice......no juice, it was punch so no milk and no juice.....I ended up bringing my own milkThere was butter and cream cheese, the cream cheese always had water on it...grossThere was apple and orange cut up. The apple was bruised apple, obviously bought cheap and it was always wet....why?Oh yeah there was oatmeal......it was so runny, like water with some oatmeal floating.No jam, no peanut butter oh and I did not appreciate that they use styrofoam. Also you have to clean your table and your plates and separate the cutlery etc. I wouldn't mind if the breakfast was better but in this case I found this ridicoulous.In the end,for the money we paid I suppose we couldn't expect much.

Was a quiet hotel with friendly staff on hand to help you out with anything u need to know about the area and able to make reservations for you if you require. Whilst it's a little out dated it offered everything we needed for our stay in Hawaii. Close to the beach and surrounding attractions we were very happy with our stay. The buffet breakfast was dedicated more for the Asian population but still was ok. The managers reception held every Tuesday is a good hour of relaxing with a cocktail in hand (provided by hotel) and live Hawaiian music playing in the foyer.

The rooms are small and dated but, it was clean and had everything we needed during our stay. King size bed was comfortable and housekeeping was good. Small bar fridge and a microwave. Front desk staff was helpful and always had tips for us to help us get around. The Aqua Resorts shuttle bus app was very helpful. We were on the 8th. floor and had a great view off our balcony. Honolulu is a busy city and you should be prepared for traffic and emergency vehicle noise 24/7. This Hotel is older and has the old school louvred glass windows, so there is no sound proofing but we were usually so tired it didn't matter. Wifi was good and worked through out the Hotel. The breakfast buffet was the only disappointment during our stay. I realize that there are a lot of Asian folks on holidays but, the buffet could probably do better catering to the North American style of breakfast and spend a little extra to use real butter for toast and pancakes instead of whatever that yellow goo is that has no flavour and basically makes everything soggy and gross. Other reviewers have mentioned the food and I thought maybe they were exaggerating but, they weren't. We sat with many different people and all had the same complaint. Bacon and real butter would immediately improve the breakfast buffet. Under cooked ham and cocktail wieners are no substitute for bacon. Parking is at a premium so be prepared to pay $25 per day or take your chances trying to find street parking. But, aside from that, if you want a comfortable room to sleep in with friendly helpful staff, I highly recommend you stay here. 10 minute walk to the beach and even less for shopping.

Its in a great location just a 5 min walk from Waikiki beach, all the shops and a 2 min walk from the bus stop for all the main routes. We arrived late the Saturday night to a warm welcome and a fast check in. We did however end up with a double bed for the first night (think this was due to the tour company not the hotel) they couldn't give us another room that night however they assured us they could give us a new room on the Sunday. We did choose to upgrade which I would recommend for $10 dollars a night it was well worth it we ended up with a balcony and a sofa (a much bigger room) They also moved all or stuff for us when the room was ready. This just advise you to keep your cases packed . Be aware you do pay $18 a night fee for the hotel however included in this is breakfast every morning ( this is in the Chinese on the side of the hotel so don't be alarmed with the egg fried rice, however there was a number of other stuff that was more than edible), free beach towels that you can change every day, free unlimited tea and coffee in you room ( none of this cheap instant stuff, it was lovely fresh perculater coffee which was a nice change compare to what you receive when traveling Europe) The cleaners done a wonderful job and the room was left spotless every day, I also left comfortable enough to not put stuff in the safe every day (mainly as I forgot) but everything was left as we placed it. All rooms seemed to have air con which is not extra, we didn't really use ours as it can be loud, we just chose to sleep with balcony door open a little ( the street outside can be noisy at certain times ) but we where on the 15th floor so wasn't too bad. We spent one day in the hotel and left just as the cleaners where at the end of their shift and offered to clean our room then for us. We declined but I thought this we just that little bit extra you look for when staying in a hotel. The pool is small and sun loungers limited. However you can't go to Waikiki and spend your whole time by the hotel pool. I would recommend going to the beach , but the pool is ideal for just an afternoon chilling out. The hotel bar is great. Beer is cheaper than in any of the restaurants you eat at. The staff where very friendly and more than helpful. It has a small smoking area outside that you can sit in and watch tv if you wish. Overall I would highly recommend this hotel. Its very clean, very friendly, not expensive. ( I would recommend upgrading ) and central to everything, They also offer a free shuttle to the main shopping centre.

Less than 2 blocks from the beach, around the corner to most public bus stops, easy walk to Ala Moana shops, Kapiolani Park etc (must enjoy walking though). As with the majority of hotels you also pay a resort tax which funds a free shuttle to the Ala Moana centre, free in room and Waikiki wifi, free DVD rental (not a great choice) and breakfast. The breakfast times are strict so I didn't eat it a few days that I had to get up early and there was no breakfast -to-go option even though you paid the tax. Breakfast is adequate but definitely geared towards the Asian market. Every Tuesday @ 4.30 the manager supplies free cocktails to guests and there is musical entertainment. I found the staff pleasant, the hotel clean. On the downside the pool is small and nothing special and the 'gym' is just some basic equipment next to the open dining area so its not an appealing area. The room was good, bathroom is a bit small and dated but served its purpose. LOVED the bed. So comfortable and I had great sleeps ( a problem for me in hotels).

We did a little research on Trip Advisor and saw that overall the reviews were decent, but there was some consternation with the breakfast buffet. We don't usually eat at hotels anyway as trying new places and food is part of our trip experience, so we went with the Aqua Aloha Surf. Very happy we did. As with any place/event/experience, the people make the difference, and at the Aqua Aloha Surf it is no different. We were greeted like friends by Nicole on our arrival, and that set a tone that lasted throughout our stay at the hotel. The cleaning staff are so nice, and did an amazing job every day. Our room always looked so nice when we returned from our day. We were given the option of a 6th or 14th floor room and we took the 14th floor. This was a good decision - all the rooms are great, but not all the veiws are million-dollar views. On the back side, if you are lower than the 10th floor, you may not have the best view. It will be mostly buildings. Higher up though and you can see the mountains, the Ala Wai Canal, the golf course and in some units you even get a peek at the ocean. The room is huge (by our standards), and nicely decorated - felt like the perfect Hawaiian atmosphere. Waking up every day with the windows/doors open is a treat (from Canada - gets a bit cool at night). Televisions in the room are big, but in our view unnecessary as we rarely returned before 10:00pm, and for some reason television in the States is terrible. Mostly all commercials and angry commentators. Now, on to the breakfast buffet. This is the weak spot, unless you have a good sense of humour and then it is pretty darn cute and funny. We tried it our first day knowing the reviews from others were not glowing. Have to say, the reviews on the buffet are spot on. The toast is good, though. The buffet has a huge selection, and we give props to the hotel for being ambitious, but our suggestion is to dial down the options and maybe focus on fewer items done a bit better. But, as mentioned, even an amazing buffet would only have been used by us once or twice - there are so many options in Hawaii, not the least is the fresh, local tropical fruit like pineapples, papayas, avocados, ..... Overall, an enjoyable stay and a great hotel to make your home base in Waikiki.","Vancouver, BC","SocialTraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, BC</strong>",29,4.0

The value of good employees and human customer service to a business can never be underestimated.We arrived quite late in the evening to the horror of realising that our reservation had not been registered by the hotel. I am not the one to say if it was otel.com or the hotel who had made a mistake, but it really doesn't matter much since ultimately the hotel has chose otel.com as a service provider. It took the reception and otel.com more than an hour to solve the issue and part of the problem was that both parties refused to spend money calling the other part and required to fix the problem via fax (this is 2016)...We got room 205 and that part of the hotel has sort of moist slightly moldy smell to it. Not too bad, but clearly noticeable. Room was quite small but that was expected as this hotel after all is a budget option in Waikiki. Bed was sold as a double bed, but I must say it was good fortune that both of us are relatively slim and we are pretty comfortable in intimate situations. Bet was small (maybe 120cm). All this was acceptable but the room is located just above a generator set, main air condition unit or something similar noisy. The first night was unbearable with a constant noise and hardly no sleep. Next morning we zombied down to the reception asking the receptionist to change room. It took him 15 sec to review the situation before offering us room 609 (surely a free upgrade) and our remainder of the stay was flawless.Big thank you to Vinh - you saved our vacation and this TripAdvisor review.

It also provided complimentary breakfast, which is hard to come by. We were greeted pleasantly by the staff and had no negative interactions with them during our week long stay. Upon check-in we informed them about the reason for the trip: birthday/ 10th anniversary, so they upgraded our room. And while it was an adequate room with microwave and fridge, it was nothing special. Bed was comfortable, view was pretty good, but at night it was quite noisy and both my wife and I occasionally woke up. This was easily solved by having the A/C fan run at night. We only ate breakfast 4 times because we were busy doing sunrise hikes on the other days. Breakfast is definitely catered to an Asian population: kimchi, fried rice and noodles, but there were other things, scrambled eggs, pancakes, orange slices, coffee cake and coconut doughnuts. The quality of food was fair: eggs were pretty runny and there was an odd flavor on the rice and noodles, but mix pancakes were...well...pancakes from a mix and tasted as such. We didn't use their pool or gym, which were not extravagant by any means. Hotel parking is $25/day, but street parking on Ala Wai Blvd is free (hit or miss), or there is paid parking next to the hotel for $15/$18 from 5pm-7am on weekday/weekends (had no trouble with availability). After paying for hotel parking 1 day we figured out the other options (wish staff had told us about those options). The hotel is conveniently located to shopping, grocery store (which we used for many of our meals), restaurants and the beach. We were able to get beach towels each day, use wi-fi and checked out some movies for free (part of resort fees). I won't go too much into the rooms, as there are plenty of other reviews. Yes the rooms are outdated and could use some extra cleaning, but we didn't go to Hawaii to spend a lot of time in our room. We used the room to sleep in and once we figured out how to solve the noise problem, we were able to get decent sleep on the beds, which were pretty comfortable.Pro: cheap rooms, free breakfast, free wifi, decent views, location to beach/shoppingCons: quality of food, street noise, outdated rooms","Portland, Oregon","GregSarahM</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",19,3.0

My wife booked 3 nights at the Aqua Aloha Surf in error thinking she was booking the Aston Wakiki (a hotel we've stayed at during a previous visit and had a WONDERFUL experience). BIG MISTAKE! Upon noticing the mistake, it was too late to cancel the reservation without penalty so we proceeded to check in. Tripadvisor presented some favorable reviews so we thought this may not be so bad... I WAS WRONG!Upon entering our room, we immediately noticed how dated and small the room was. But the ULTIMATE turn off was not the paint peeling from the dressers, rusted spacesavers in the bathroom or even the accumulated mildew on the bathroom fixtures... it was the potential hepatitis the poor housekeeping exposed my family and I to with the DRIED UP BLOOD i found on one of the dressers!!!Upon bringing the matter to the managers (Julian Martinez) attention, they promptly changed my room. However, this already set the tone for the unpleasant experience. The new room included all of the amenities of the previous room: the rusted and soap scum/mildew infested bathroom, stained couch pillows, etc. However, thankfully, I didn't notice any blood in this room.Given the horrific experience of night 1, I was under the impression that management would at least offer to discount the first night, provide a complimentary room upgrade, SOMETHING! But no... that didn't happen. My wife and I spent the entire night browsing for affordable lodging elsewhere for the duration of our trip. The next day we woke up to having a TERRIBLE breakfast at the hotel. This put the icing on the cake for our decision to end our stay there prematurely. I strongly advice against staying there... as friendly as the staff is, it does not make up for the very poor service and outdated, poorly maintained rooms.

It was a great rate for an affordable stay in Waikiki and I felt that it delivered great value even for that low rate. The staff is terrific in an quiet way; they upgraded me to the next level room without even asking. I enjoyed a king bed room with lanai and city views. The room itself is basic but was everything I needed. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed the views from my corner location. The air conditioning worked and there was coffee maker and minifridge. They provide free wifi, complimentary beach chair and towel, and free dvd (which I was too busy to use). They just don't nickel and dime you to death. I so greatly appreciated being allowed a late checkout which other hotels can be very stingy about. I felt they were always accommodating. I liked it so much that I brought my friends staying at another hotel by and they decided to switch to this hotel later in the week and also loved their stay.I am surprised at the negative reviews on the breakfast buffet. It was far better than most breakfasts provided at hotels especially in this price range. Sure, it is not the typical American or continental breakfast and it is geared to a more Asian market but the quality was very good. Their scrambled eggs were delicious and they had delicious sponge cake and she was making pancakes all the time. I enjoyed the fried rice with fried cabbage; it was all fresh and delicious. There was also sliced oranges.The lobby is a little worn and dated and it is not one of the swanky hotels on the beach but it was all fine and a great value for the price. There was some noise in the morning so those who are sensitive to that may want to ask for a rear location as some other reviews suggest. I loved my city corner views so the noise was worth it for me. It is only about 3 blocks walk to the beach and is very well located. The bus stop is about a block away and you can take the public bus to Hanauma Bay. Another tip for transportation: I found a shuttle bus company (8088412928) that was only $12.50 each way to the airport. They picked me up right at the hotel and is the lowest rate I could fine.

We paid in advance to secure our room, but upon arrival, the hotel had no booking for us. They gave us a small room which adjoined a standard-sized hotel room. No partial refund was offered for the inconvenience of accommodating us in an inferior room.2. Ensuite had absolutely NO counter space to put cosmetics or shaving gear. Had to use toilet lid. 3. Noise from the street below was unbearable, even with doors and windows closed. 4. Our reason for selecting this hotel was the offer of continental breakfast. We needn't have held our breath - there was no jam or marmalade; only maple syrup because we were told: ""it's too expensive"", The dining room where we ate was a DISGRACE. In any other Western country such a building would be condemned, but alas, we sat in a room with ceiling only half there and bits of ceiling were hanging down. The walls had exposed framing and cables, but no plaster. A concertina divider supposedly hid all the junk (ladders, tools etc). behind it. At the conclusion of breakfast, we neatly stacked out plates on the table and got up to leave, when a female employee rushed over and ordered us to clean the table and scrape our leftovers into the uncovered plastic bin situated in the centre of the room. 5. Two doors provided access to this dining room (entry and exit). In the event we mistakenly used the wrong door, we were quickly reminded by a ""doorman"" in dark shades to go the other way. Pulling a towel taut in front of our faces, he barred us leaving the room. Not once did he speak or smile. 6. Staff at the front desk were friendly enough and obliging. 7. Day Two in the hotel: We asked for milk with our coffee and were directed to a separate room which was specifically allocated to Asian tourists. In that room, we found a vat of milk which we had to scoop out with a ladle! 8. Would NEVER, EVER go there again and would recommend that people avoid this hotel. It is more like a backpackers' hovel.","Greater Melbourne, Australia","veyron108</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater Melbourne, Australia</strong>",1,1.0

But when we arrived, it was two single beds and one sofa bed. Three adults can in no way fit on two single beds that were not even joined. • The sofa bed was terrible, could feel every spring in it. When we informed staff they gave us another wheel in bed but that was just as bad. They made no attempts to relocate us to a different room. Thought this was unfair as we all paid equal amounts and so all deserve a proper decent bed to sleep in.• We decided then to put the mattress on the floor and take turns sleeping on it, and even though room service saw our mattress on the floor they made no attempts to rectify this, a simple sorry would have gone a long way.• One light in the room was missing, which meant we had to rely on the bathroom light for one half of the room• They never left enough toilet paper for us, so for those 10 nights we asked for toilet paper every day. Wouldn’t be the worst idea to leave a stock of them in the bathroom though.• Room service meant doing the beds and literally nothing else. The shower and toilet wasn’t cleaned once for those ten nights.• The room had no salt, pepper, sugar, tea or milk. Only one sachet of coffee was provided for 10 days. No kettle or toaster either.• Some curtains wouldn’t work and that meant we could only close half of the window, so we always had light streaming into our room at night. Not good!• At breakfast time, we were meant to present the breakfast lady with our breakfast cards, after a few days I forgot mine and though she recognised me she wouldn’t let me have any food unless and until I went upstairs and got my card which she would just scribble on. It was embarrassing being denied food, considering she had seen me every day for the past 5 days and knew I had a breakfast card. Not like she was keeping count or making a record of anything.• Also during breakfast there were a bunch of rules: “Only two eggs per person”. No jam or honey was provided either and it was the same breakfast all 10 days. • They said they had a gym but there were a grand total of 3 machines and 2 of which were incredibly rusted and the treadmill was always covered and not accessible. We’re new to this country and paid a pretty decent amount for this accommodation, I don’t expect 5 star quality, but the general amenities would have been nice. The staff were helpful when we asked about tours and other activities and did give us some helpful advice. A big thank you to staff member Douglas who has amazing customer service.

It was cheap ish compared with lots of the other places in Waikiki so I would probably stay there again if I couldn't afford a beach front hotel.","New York City, New York","jktweed</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",29,3.0

Nothing can compare with the service we received from the front desk to the housekeeping staff. We arrived late but check in was a breeze! Staff were always ready and willing to assist when they could. The room was clean, bed was comfortable and pillows were just right for me. We used AC the first couple nights but we're soon used to the climate that we only had the windows open at night. I found the room adequate for our needs, we were only sleeping there. We didn't go to Hawaii spend a lot of time in the room. The location was good, we were close enough to walk to the beach, other hotels to be picked up for our excursions and to all great restaurants. After they found out that we were newly engaged, they sent up champagne and chocolates...that was a really unexpected treat. Breakfast was ok (pancakes, mini donuts, cake, muffins, 2 types of dry cereal, hot oatmeal, cocktail sausages, rice and boiled eggs, white/brown bread to make toast), nothing over the top but filled our hungry tummies in the morning. This was part of our holiday package otherwise I believe it was $6/day. There is a $15/day hospitality fee but this fee is at all hotels and some hotels were more. Free DVD rentals were an added bonus too! We will definately make this our hotel the next time we come!

The Hotel is tired and needs a makeover. Our room on the seventh floor was small with no overhead lighting and only two bedside lamps. The aircon unit which sits in the window cavity was noisy. There wasn't even a chair in the room. The breakfasts on offer (the same everyday) were disgusting consisting of boiled rice, hard boiled eggs kept warm in a metal warmer, mini sausages the size of my little finger, something that looked like a lumpy porridge, two cheap cereals but only very small bowls to pour it into, bread to toast but no jams or honey etc. Ended up having a boiled egg sandwich on toast. The best on offer were freshly made small pancakes and maple syrup. Oh and small slices of a cake and mini crunchy donuts (which I observed being emptied out of a packet.) The people who have the contract to supply these 'breakfasts' are seriously letting the Hotel down. After two mornings we gave this breakfast a miss and either bought fresh fruit or ate at the Food Pantry around the corner. Several other visitors were doing the same and commented about how disgusting the breakfasts were. You were even expected to and told to if you didn't scrape your scraps into a bin on a trolley and stack your plates and cutlery before leaving. What kind of Hotel asks its patrons to do this???? What a first! We observed 'the lady' following a departing family and TELLING them to 'go back and clear your table!' It wasn't even them who had left the 'so called mess.' The staff were polite and helpful and I'm sure they are aware of the dissatisfaction of guests re the breakfasts. These same people also had a buffet lunch and dinner on offer but we rarely saw anyone eating there. One couple did try it and said it was the worst meal they can remember. The best compliment I can offer is the location which is just two blocks (a five minute walk) from the beach and plenty of food outlets close by and an ABC Store a few minutes down the street. We discovered the restaurant at Hotel across the road and ate there four nights. Their food, wide menu choices, prices and service were excellent. We saw plenty of guests from our Hotel eating there too! This is where we intend to book into on our next stay in Waikiki.","San Remo, Australia","Sandra T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Remo, Australia</strong>",11,2.0

I narrowed it down to several and then selected AAS ( Aqua Aloha Surf). The staff is impressive and responsive; what else can I say? The place is super clean. The room (10th floor) was quiet and plenty large for our needs and there was a pull out sofa sleeper. The balcony was comfortable and large with a great view of city or it could be canal on other side. Frig and m/w were most useful. TV was large and rotated for either bed (king) or sofa viewing. The hotel shares a parking lot with THE ONLY supermarket in Waikiki and the Food Pantry has a great bakery; thank you very much. They also provide beach chairs and towels so we spent lots of time on the main beach which is 2 blocks from hotel. They even provide umbrellas for the rainy days and we had several. You are an easy walk from several great restaurants including Moana Beach restaurant $$$$, Tanaka, and a wonderful noodle asian place. The breakfasts in house until 9 am are excellent i.e. oatmal and freshly made to order pancakes are great plus toast, fresh fruit and such. Not a complaint here. We were half block from a major bus stop and used it to go everywhere on island. We also booked a Roberts Circle Island tour on-line for $ 37 for eight hours! Excellent and we brought our own lunch from Food Pantry. We would not hesitate to return. Loved the experience.

The lady at reception was very helpful and got us a room on the fourth floor, which was great - we could sit on the balcony! Both rooms were in need of redecoration and the furniture was old and scuffed and not very good quality. The location of the hotel was good - just turn right out of the hotel and a five minute walk gets you to the beach.There was a restaurant but it never seemed to be open to the hotel guests (we were told it was not run by the hotel) and the ""continental breakfast"" was served, not in the restaurant but in a very inadequate space near the pool. The choice at breakfast was poor, there were not enough tables and chairs for the number of guests, we had to clear our own tables and put the crockery and cutlery on a trolley!

It is located in the heart of Waikiki. Overall my impression of this hotel is great... but not excellent. For starters, I do not like the food selection that was offer in the hotel restaurant menu but it doesn't really matter because their are a lot of restaurants to choose from nearby. I had a pretty bad experienced on my first night there. There was no power and electricity, so management offered me an upgraded room on the second floor free of charge, which I decline because there was no balcony on that floor. Turns out to be an excellent choice because my room on the 14th floor had some of the most amazing and spectacular views. Very romantic too, if you are staying with an spouse. Continental breakfast is free... but is bland... consists of pancakes, boiled eggs, glazed ham, a variety of fruits, coffee, tea, and juice. Not bad when you wake up and feel hungry. One of the perks that I came to admire is the hotel offers their guests free towels and a beach chair... on the condition that it must be returned when guests are finish with it. Hotel also offer free wi-fi, had an gym, sauna, swimming pool, which I never had a chance to use because I swim in the beach instead. I would recommend this hotel to travelers, especially if they are Canadians and if they are on an budget. Aqua Aloha Surf charged me in Canadian funds, which was very affordable and rate was very reasonable. Hotel also offer shuttle service to mall and airport.

I got an email replied telling me how to go to the hotel but did not reply me with other information. I ended up brought a mini shampoo, soap, and conditioner with me. After reading all the reviews about this hotel, we felt that we should have chosen other hotel.The hotel was a bit old from the outside but it was ok for a budget hotel. The checked in time was fast as we arrived at night time. We two were given a room on the 3rd floor with two beds. We tried to request with two beds on a higher floor, but no twin beds were available on the higher floor except for one queen bed on the 9th floor (Standard room). We two took the 9th floor one. After we got the room, the room was not that small compared to what the reviews from other people. Actually, it was bigger if you compared with other budget hotels in Asian countries. We were actually in room 913, but it was not that bad that compared to one of the comment. The room was a bit old, but clean and quite quiet even though it was quite near the evaluator. The other two persons came on the next day, and upgraded to the deluxe room with extra fee. The room was much bigger with a sofa bed. (So, if you want a bigger room, pay a bit extra). Like other reviews said, the air conditioner in the standard room actually next to the bed, but I am ok with that. On the other hand, the air conditioner located far away from the bed in the deluxe room.The location is good, and it took less than 10 minutes walking to the Wakiki beach. There were McDonald’s, Starbucks, and Burger King within 7 minutes walking. Bus stop was about 2 minutes walking from the hotel. You can take bus from the airport if you have a hand carry luggage.There was a $15 fee resort fee charged for each day. It was said that the fee included the following; breakfast, beach towel, DVD rental, and shuttle bus to Ala Moana. The shuttle bus ran every 30 minutes, and it could hold up to 15 or 16 persons. Therefore, it would be better if you go there by bus. However, it actually took less time to arrive to your hotel compared to bus. We tried one departing at 9pm from Ala Moana to the hotel, and it was really fast and comfortable. (However, it was always full during day time).Regarding to the breakfast, like what other traveller’s comment, it was same every day. The breakfast included; pancake, rice, mini sausage, two boiled egg, porridge, cereal, sponge cake (not everyday, or when rice was ran out), one or two types of mini donut (roasted coconut, or chocolate), mini biscuit, white bread, sliced apple, sliced orange, coffee, tea, or a juice in red color (I have no idea what that is, but if Tim Clark, the manager can tell me here). The food could be warm if you went to eat after 7:30am. The porridge was watery on top; therefore, you need to mix it with the bottom first; however, I liked more watery. In my opinion, the breakfast was not bad that was mentioned from other post. I actually ate breakfast at the hotel everyday. I have been to another hotel in Portland, and the breakfast was only white bread, scramble egg, bacon, orange, apple, coffee, and tea. Therefore, as a budget hotel, the breakfast was considerate as good in my opinion, and I cannot complain about it. The only suggest I would say was that it would look nice to put a table clothes, and I think it would look good when picking the food. In addition, I suggest that put all the cutlery (Folk, spoon, and knife) outside instead of next to the pancake. It was convenience to hold the cutlery when I want to have a bowl of porridge, or a cup of coffee.On every Tuesday between 4:30pm to 5:30pm, there is a kind of small party in the lobby.

The staff are rude and were at times really unhelpful. The breakfast is really awful and isn't technically free because you pay a hospitality fee. The breakfast 'police' who checks your card was incredibly rude and really makes breakfast unpleasant. The facilities are basic but are fine if you're just happy to sleep there and use it as a base. It's cheap for the area and close by. One more thing the free shuttle is a joke. We could never use it because it was always too full... A very flawed system.

No problem though as like many people - we wernt here for the room. Free WiFi was good fast and strong signal and a local corner shop is handy.Breakfast was a let down. It's a strange set up with a supervisor checking on everything you do. One time we didn't bring our ticket down and were sent back to the room to find it before we were allowed breakfast. I'm unsure why they just don't have a list of rooms/people for breakfast like in every other hotel. Breakfas is like a school canteen with a very limited range and plastic cups.

We're not the type of travelers who spend most of our time in the hotel room to begin with so we feel that the standard room fit well into our needs (basically for sleeping), but a balcony would have been nice as we do enjoy our cigars. Our room also came equipped with a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. That being said, if you are looking for a hotel with a nice big pool, or jacuzzi/hot tub, sauna etc. then it's best to look elsewhere in Waikiki. At the same time the breakfast offered here isn't exactly a home run either, but at least it's something if you look at the other side of the coin. The strange part was that the hotels complimentary coffee in the lobby (near the elevator) was actually much better then what was served in the room with the breakfast.... Not sure if other reviewers noticed that? That aside though the hotel is also very close to Waikiki beach which was great! And you are pretty much walking distance to most attractions in Waikiki. If your also looking to go to the Ala Moana Shopping Center you get a free slip from the hotel which allows you access to a free shuttle bus for the duration of your stay. Closest stop to our hotel by the way is the Aqua Pacific Monarch Hotel (5-10 minute walk from the hotel). The other thing to note is that for each night you stay at the hotel you are charged a $15 (per night) hospitality fee. This is suppose to cover things like the game rentals for the PS3 in your room and movies. I have to say we weren't fans of paying this fee as we don't feel we really got the return back in value, but if every hotel does it in Waikiki then I guess one doesn't have much of a choice.

It's not the greatest hotel but it's not the worst either, especially for the location. The only reason I gave it four stars was not necessarily for the hotel itself, which could use a bit of updating. However they were renovating one of the elevators during our stay (the other was already completed) so one elevator for 15 floors and thousands of guests wasn't ideal. The room itself was a pretty decent size, we stayed in the superior room with the Lanai (balcony), it has a king bed and a sofa that has a pull out bed. It includes a refrigerator (kept things from spoiling but didn't keep things extremely cold), a microwave, coffee pot with coffee, plates, mugs and silverware. They had a small TV and a PS3 in the room where you could watch movies from the DVD rental box downstairs. Anyway, the four stars, you're two blocks from Waikiki beach. About a 15 minute walk from the zoo and aquarium and various shops/mall. Down the street from the hotel there is also a food pantry (grocery store) that also has a coffee bean and a delicious food place called Hi Steaks. There's an ABC store that is extremely handy (even though they have one on just about every corner). The hotel offers breakfast from 7-9 am. Which consists of pancakes, ham, white rice (soy sauce available), oranges, apples, two or three different types of cakes and donuts, and cereal (with powdered milk). They have tea, orange juice and coffee for drinks. The staff was nice even though upon arrival we had to wait about 15 minutes for someone to check us in even though there were three people behind the main desk. the six nights we were there, house keeping only serviced our room twice. Both days we were out most of the day until late evening. The other days it would be 2:30 or 3pm when we would get back and they would be cleaning the rooms next door, but not ours. We understood with 15 floors and thousands of rooms maybe one or two days but four days? At least when they knocked, they were friendly and asked if we needed anything. There is a laundry room in the parking garage/basement under the hotel. $1.25 for washer and another $1.25 for dryer, it honestly came in handy. The wifi was okay but not great, it got the job done.

The location is great for the price, it's walking distance to Waikiki beach. But the two elevators were extremely slow and one was then shut down for maintenance.

However, I woke up with bug bites several days into our stay here. I gave it another night and woke up with even more bug bites which are confirmed to be from bed bugs. Bed bug bites were a new experience for me and not one I would ever want to go thru again. I discreetly spoke with the General Manager of the property and explained my concerns about the apparent bugs in our room. I understand that people travel from all over the world and live in quite different circumstances than I am accustomed to. I don't fault the hotel for having bed bugs but I do fault the GM for his lack of concern and communication. As we waited in the lobby, he sent a housekeeping lady to our room. She appeared quite some time later with a push cart full of boxes of trash can liners. I assumed to bag everything up. She went into the GM's office, closed the door and after some time they both walked out. My husband and I approached them and the housekeeper stated that she did not find anything. The GM was on his cell phone and never got off the phone to discuss the situation. Thankfully, we were due to check out later that day! I don't think I could have made it another night! I am very disappointed in the approach or lack thereof taken by management. I am still itching and in a lot of discomfort almost a week later. I had the pleasure of returning home and storing all of my luggage in the garage to kill off any bugs we may have brought home with us. Also, I should mention than upon checking out you pay the $15.00 per night resort fee and $22.00 per night + tax for parking (which you may or may not get a spot). The breakfast menu was the same every day that we were there. It consisted of toast, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, apples, oranges, small donuts, rice and luncheon ham. The positives to this property is that it is in a decent location (if you don't mind noise). We were on the 12th floor and it was extremely loud by 6 am from street traffic.

There are plenty of shops and restaurants in close proximity, ABC shops, a great Thai restaurant and a 50's type cafe ""The Rock Island Cafe"", which is worth a visit. The rooms vary in size from just a room to suites, the more space, the higher cost. The rooms are clean but the building is old with louvered windows that whistle in the wind. The windows cannot be closed tight enough to stop the whistle. The air conditioner is the older style, box in the wall, noisey and cannot cope with the Honolulu conditions. Better off opening the windows if you can handle the wind blowing through at the higher levels. The rooms are also noisey from traffic and air-con from other buildings. Free WiFi is available. The tap in the bathroom is very difficult to use to rinse out the mouth after brushing teeth, better off using the tap at the kitchenette. The worst of our stay at the Aqua Aloha Hotel was the breakfast. It was included in the cost but we did note a sign at the front of the hotel, $6 breakfast. My wife and I have eaten in many hotels around the world and this experience would have to be the worst. One would get a better meal at a hostel In detail the pancakes were too thick and gluggy, the breads were too sweet, the boiled eggs were cold, the cereals too sweet and the coffee, even with real milk was awful, with powdered milk which was offered, it was worse. In a word, undrinkable, in a group of 7, none of the coffees were drunk. The only item on the menu that was any good was the slices of orange. (did not try the oatmeal) Then on leaving we were chased out the door and told to clear our plates off the table. That would not normally be an issue if we were advised beforehand that our table had to be cleared on leaving but we not and I do not recall seeing any signs.

After a grueling 11 hour flight, I attempted to check in but was advised that the Hotel couldn't find my reservation. You can now imagine the frustration I was feeling and the opportunity to vent on the front desk ambassador Douglas Neuner ( i uncovered his name later). But before I was able to ""unleash"" my frustrations on him, he anticipated my frustration and proceeded to clearly explain the situation to me in a very calming and professional way, After calming me down and getting me to understand it wasn't the fault of the hotel, he then brought out the hotel's Reservation Mgr. Ms. Aimee Noa, who then explained how the booking process worked and educated me again on why this situation occurred. They then quickly provided me with another hotel room, provided a wonderful upgraded guest room and made clear that the problem would be fixed after my departure. Just from this interaction alone, I knew I picked the right hotel as their ability to turn a potentially bad sitauiton into a positive guest experience, thus I'm writing this revew.As for the hotel facility, my guest room came with a mini frdige/frezzer and a microwave which is perfect for storing drinks and my ""leftover"" food of my dinners. There are many outlets to power up your mobile devices, free wi-fi , comfortable bedding, a private lanai and air conditioning. Great value for the quality of the room.The hotel is also in a great location close to the Food Pantry Grocery Store and ""smack dab"" in the middle of waikiki for easy access to all your activities. They also provide free shuttle service to one of the world's largest outdoor malls ""Ala Moana Shopping Center.""Added bonus is the complimentary continental breakfast, free use of beach chairs and towels and a small excerise area that makes do for the few days I was there.Overall, the facility is very good value no doubt.

I don't prefer to be in the middle of everything so this was perfect. A five to seven minute walk to Waikiki Beach. The hotel lobby was nice and welcoming. The check in was simple, a lot of extras are included for the $15 resort fee. Parking was also available for a fee. I went to the room and my electronic keys would not work. I returned to the desk and got the keys redone. Again they didn't work.Douglas stepped in and offered me another room and even offered to upgrade me for my trouble as he made yet again another set of keys. Douglas was a superstar. I ended up staying in my original room after receiving a set of keys that worked properly.As advertised the rooms are small.

We ate breakfast there one time and that was enough for us. The Sand Bar and Grill across the street has a breakfast buffet but it is not that good either for $12.95 a person. The plus to this hotel is that it is around the corner from a Food Pantry (small grocery store) it has a Coffee Bean coffee house and there are a couple of small restaurants in side as well.

We had a bed, a dresser with a microwave and a coffee machine on it and a cabinet with a fridge in it and the TV and a gaming unit on it. That is it. Our suitcases had to stay on the floor because there was nowhere to put them. There was no chair to sit in. When we asked at least for a chair, we got a plastic chair. We were told that all the units are owned by different people and what the unit has is what the people think they need to supply. The deluxe units I think are bigger and have a sofa.

This was my second visit to Oahu (loved it so much I had to return) - my previous budget hotel was a few blocks away- but the deal at the Aqua Aloha was better. Breakfast was basic but tasty - the freshly made pancakes were absolutely delicious. Spam and rice was available too. Coffee in the room tasted weird but there was some available in the lobby during the day which I preferred. Some people were put off by the birds flying over and onto the tables on the outdoor section at breakfast - this didn't worry me but I guess it could be a hygiene issue.Didn't use the outdoor pool as the beach was so near. The lobby area was small but pleasant - enjoyed using the wifi in the evenings to research our trips for the following day.The room itself had a nice partial view over the canal towards the mountains. Shower was very basic (which I expected) but it did the job. The bed was comfy enough but the downside to the room was the noise and lack of privacy. Curtains didn't quite cover the window area enough and you could partially see into windows in apartments opposite. (I ended up using a peg to secure the curtains). Also - the slatted windows, which didn't close fully, meant there was a lot of noise and echo from the street below. The noisy aircon helped to block this out.I've given my rating based on the fact that Waikiki can be a very pricey place to stay- but the Aqua Aloha meets all your basic needs without breaking the bank.",anon,"owlAnon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>anon</strong>",123,4.0

The location relative to Waikiki beach is good and the facilities and size of their “Superior” room as described on their website suited our needs and budget.Travellers should note that the Continental Breakfast is very basic although they do provide hard boiled eggs . The hotel does not provide milk for tea, coffee or breakfast cereals, providing an artificial 'creamer' instead. There are no jugs in the rooms to boil water for tea. Tea bags and hot water are available in the lobby. There was a perculator for making coffee in the rooms.Our experience after the first stay was very positive. The second stay was unfortunately a disappointment. On our first stay we had a room with a fabulously comfortable queen bed and a nice view from our balcony. The room was clean and all the essentials we needed worked. Our check- in and check- out were handled in a friendly and efficient manner and our overall impression was very positive. Unfortunately our experience was quite different for our second stay a week later. Our room only had a double bed and the shower facilities were very old and tired. Our balcony view this time only looked over adjoining apartment blocks. In addition, we also experienced poor staff service when we dared to complain about the hotel running out of basic provisions (tea bags). There were also issues with other provisions in the lobby that weekend. The older male service staff on duty were at best indifferent and certainly not customer service focused. The tea bag saga, and no creamer and cold coffee in the lobby are only small issues per se, but when combined with a room that was anything but 'superior' and unhelpful/ unfriendly front desk staff, the positive experience of our stay the week earlier was 'wiped out'.

Our criteria were: pool, breakfast and WiFi + reasonable distance to the beach/centre. All hotels in this area are expensive, so we had to accept that, and we paid about $850 dollars for 6 nights. Breakfast was strictly limited to 7-9 am, which meant that we missed it on 2 days due to early starts, but when we had it, it was fine - all the expected continental items plus fresh made pancakes with maple syrup and porridge. Plenty of cut-up oranges for fruit.WiFi was restricted to the foyer area -but this was fine - rather nice to sit in the open foyer and use the internet. Charging socket available near the drinks machine. Free coffee/tea + daily paper in the foyer, too.Pool was small but adequate. Room was great. We paid a little more per night for an upgrade and got more space + two views (including one over the canal, looking towards the mountains). Also, on a quiet corner of the hotel which was good as others did complain about noisy street outside. Our room, on the 4th floor, was OK for noise, apart from the air conditioning - even if we switched ours off, you could hear others' working - but just imagine it is waves!Easy walking distance to the beach, the shops & restaurants and bus stops. The staff were lovely. Especially the concierge who was very knowledgeable and helped us patiently each day to plan our activities. Anything she didn't know, she looked up.Other staff were also nice; no problem about finding change for the bus for example (you have to give exact change of $2.50 per person).Interesting red shrimps displayed in reception - the hotel has a connection with their conservation on the Big Island. A small bookshelf has books available - as a keen member of bookcrossing.com this was a bonus and I left a book on the shelves and found one that I wanted to read.Bed was comfy and king-size. Room was clean and tidied every day. Coffee provided plus nice toiletries. Small balcony did not have much of a view but was useful for drying washing!The canal is close by and worth a walk along - you can clearly see at least two kinds of fish in the water.All in all, we were pleased with our choice and would happily stay at this hotel again.","Worcestershire, United Kingdom","Howarth S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Worcestershire, United Kingdom</strong>",176,4.0

On August 1, I arrived in Honolulu via plane at 10:30 pm at night. As soon as my plane landed, I called the hotel to confirm the room at Aqua Aloha Surf. A woman who answered the phone confirmed my reservation and I informed her that I would be checking in in about an hour. She repeated that my room was confirmed. When I finally arrived at the hotel at midnight, I was informed upon checking in that there was no room available for me as the hotel overbooked. Lance, the man working at the front desk, stated that he had no idea why I was told that the room was confirmed considering that ""everyone knew the situation."" Rather, Lance informed me that Iwould be relocated to another hotel about 10 minutes away. It was midnight and as as single woman traveler, I was upset and a bit nervous about having to locate to a completely new hotel. When I arrived at the other hotel, it did not have the same amenities as the hotel room Ibooked. I specifically booked Aqua Aloha Surf because of its location to the beach and its wifi. The hotel they moved me to, Pagoda Hotel, was not within walking distance of Waikiki Beach nor did it have wifi internet access. Additionally, the taxi driver that took me to the new hotel told me that Aqua Aloha Surf tends to do this quite often- overbook and then move their guests to another hotel. I wanted to alertpeople. This hotel moved paying guests from the hotel they book to another one.

Regardless of your reason for visiting the Honolulu this hotel is a great budget choice (would be a solid 2 star on the mainland). The hotel is close to restaurants and more shopping then a human needs. 2 Blocks from the beach. The hotel is relatively quite Of course my air conditioner was load so it blocked out most street noise, also blew directly on me and was not comfortable. I found the beds to be OK, but a little hard, complete with small frig & microwave & coffee pot. They just put Play station 3 in all the rooms so U can get free games and movies in the lobby. Had a Mgrs reception on Tuesday for an hour or so with free drinks and live music (nice touch) also had a low dresser.&a small TV (19”) I have a bigger one in my camper, never had one this small in a hotel room!! (see pics) bathroom that gives you NO space lay out your toiletries and with an old fashion step in shower.Definite lack of receptacles to charge your equip.The pool (outside) was nice looking ( I didn't use) free WIFI U in the lobby and I believe if U have an Ethernet cord U can plug in your room. Parking is $22.00 per night. The staff is very friendly & helpful.. Search for the best internet rate and can get and stay here, you won’t regret it.

The bathroom seemed a lot older than the rest of the room, slightly tired perhaps, but was still very clean with no issues. Like most of Waikiki it was only a 5 minute walk to the beach, and there were plenty of places to eat and drink nearby. The public transport bus stops just round the corner, and offers a cheap and quick ride to places such as the Ala Moana mall and is a safe efficient way to travel round.

The rate was very affordable ($99/nt booked through Hotwire) compared to other hotels in the Waikiki area, and this included a buffet breakfast (see more on breakfast below). And the location was good--walking distance to the beach, shops and restaurants. Because of this we didn't bother renting a car while we stayed. The room (queen + twin) was clean as was everything else in the hotel. There are a number of restaurants that participate in a delivery service to the hotel (a catalog of menus is in the room), so you could choose to eat in if you like. The concierge was very helpful, and we were able to purchase tickets to a luau through the hotel, a great time saver!What could be done better: The ""queen"" bed in our room was awfully small, and I suspected it was actually a double bed. My husband is big and tall, so the two of us in a double bed is not comfortable at all. The room was small, comparable to a cabin on a cruise ship, though it did include a small refrigerator, microwave and some dishes and utensils for eating. The breakfast buffet was almost not edible. The hard-boiled eggs were... well, let's just say that they had an unusual texture. (How do you mess up hard-boiled eggs??!) And the multitude of birds were constantly picking at the dirty dishes left by the guests at the tables and in a bin. If a free breakfast weighs heavily in your decision for a hotel, then this will be a disappointment. The decor and fixtures are a bit dated, but when you're spending most of your time at the beach and out-and-about, it probably doesn't matter much unless you want to hang around the hotel. Wi-fi is only available in the lobby with hard-wired ethernet available in the rooms. I can't connect my iPhone via ethernet so I was not pleased with the inconvenience.Overall impression: if you have a limited budget for vacationing in Waikiki, this hotel will suffice. Not bad, but not great.","West Lafayette, Indiana","Anita S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Lafayette, Indiana</strong>",5,3.0

I was not expecting much at all for the price, but boy was I surprised. From the moment I walked in the front door to the moment I stepped into my cab ride to the airport, I was greeted with friendliness and the 'aloha' spirit. My first impression was from the clean, open lobby and the friendly and helpful front desk. Not only did they greet me warmly and seem very happy to be there, the awesome gentleman at the front desk started up some small talk while he was processing my room and didn't rush me away from the desk as soon as he was done. In almost every other hotel I've been at, the front desk feels more like a 'business first' philosophy, and this is the first time I've walked away from the front desk and still felt like a human being (and not just a room number).For the next 7 days, the hotel continued to impress me. The hotel was close enough to the main area of the city for shopping, eating, night life, etc but far enough away that noise wasn't a huge problem. The room was big enough without feeling like a cave; just the right size to feel comfy. Personally, I don't need too much in a room to be happy and the room I booked was more than good enough. Besides the standard bed/dresser/TV, the room came equipped with clean dishes (including cutlery), a small couch, a coffee table, a sink, an (empty) refrigerator, air conditioning unit, and small balcony.From the location, to the friendly and helpful staff (including the front desk, manager, maintenance crew, and cleaning crew), to the room itself, to the amenities such as the pool and breakfast, everything was just right. Cons: None that I could think of. The only complaints I've seen are over the breakfast menu, free wifi, and pool size, possibly, but you are literally next to the main strip of Waikiki, which is bordering the crystal clear ocean waters. You have Diamond Head Crater and Pearl Harbor nearby, besides all of the attractions and authentic eateries (Pho Thinh, Leonard's Bakery, Rainbow Cafe, and Marukame Udon are all recommended). You shouldn't be at the hotel for these things!Pros: Everything. Next I'm in Honolulu (which will hopefully be soon, whether on business or pleasure) I fully planning on booking a room on at the Aqua Aloha Surf in Waikiki. 10/10, would recommend to anyone looking for a friendly, pleasant stay!","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","gigaleet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</strong>",4,5.0

I wish we would have got the lady's name that helped us that night, but we were too tired from flight. The room was a decent size, and provided what we needed while there. There were a few things I wish were different. Our window could not close and there were very strong winds so it caused the door to shake from the draft throughout the nights. Also, the bathroom door wouldn't lock and the bathroom in its entirety was outdated. However, the shower worked out fine. I wish the Internet worked also. We tried the wifi downstairs and the ethernet cord, but they both were not working. The breakfast was not what we expected, but it works for people on a budget.

The tv is small and the cable reception was not very good...but we weren't in Hawaii to watch tv!The beach is a short walk away, and the Ala Wai Canal is right beside the hotel. It's a great location, as it has the best of both world - a quiet street beside a lovely canal for walking, but quick access to all of the hustle and bustle of Waikiki. There is a grocery store right around the corner on Kuhio, and ample restaurants within walking distance. The morning breakfast was very appreciated. The selection is not fantastic as far as healthy choices, but the fresh made pancakes were the best I've ever had (honestly!)

I don't need a resort atmosphere nor amenities. I recommend that travelers who have similar needs for a hotel check out the Aqua Aloha Surf!For around $100 a night I got a big king deluxe room with a bathroom with full-sized shower/tub, small kitchenette area, sofa and balcony. The balcony had great views of the rest of Waikiki, the mountains and a bit of ocean. The room was clean and mostly well-maintained. It had a very good A/C unit with remote control - which wasn't needed because of the room's nice slatted glass windows, which let in a nice breeze and kept the room cool. A generous breakfast was included. The hotel is just a few minutes' walk from Waikiki beach. It is also very near stops for The Bus, which gets you nearly anywhere on Oahu for cheap.This is solidly a 4-star review for a budget hotel. I can't give it 5 stars for the following reasons:1) Bathroom was a little dated and shabby. The tub was clean and fairly new but the walls and sliding door were a little banged up and could use a fresh coat of paint. The bathroom also desperately needed a fan!2) The bathroom had few accessibility aids. There were no grab bars in the tub nor bathroom walls, or a no-slip mat in the tub. I have to point this deficiency out because I stayed with my partner who has limited mobility. He made do with no incident but I caution that those who are more disabled may have problems. I encourage the hotel management to consider installing these critical safety features in each of the rooms, at some point.3) The WiFi was awfully slow and difficult to use. Not too important to me but my partner observed that it was essentially unusable. It was also totally inaccessible from our 10th floor room.Despite this short list of complaints, I love this hotel and I will definitely be back.

The staff, from check-in to check-out were very helpful and professional. The hotel manager's ""Welcome Cocktail"" on Tuesday evening was an unexpected surprise.The location is great, about a 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. The hotel was built in days when energy conservation was not as great a concern as it is today. The windows are venetian slatted glass and even when closed there is really no seal to the outside. The drawback here is the room air conditioner has a hard time keeping up with the mid-day heat and if there are emergency vehicles traversing close by during the night, you'll hear them for sure.

We were very excited about our stay and planned and reserved many activities, restaurants and car rental based on our hotel location. When we arrived at the Aqua Aloha Surf from an over 6 hour flight from Arizona and were told that they did not have a room for us due to over booking, we were in a huge state of shock. For one, we are both seasoned travelers and luckily have never, ever experienced this and secondly, we never received any advance notice of this by either email or phone. The front desk staff and manager did their job and tried be nice, however it left us with a very uneasy feeling to start our vacation off this way. In any case, we were given a box of chocolates and told that they reserved a room for us at the Luana hotel located on Kalakaua. Since neither my husband nor myself have ever been to Honolulu, we had no idea what this meant location wise for everything we had planned. However, at this point based on what the people at the hotel were telling us, we hoped to be fine with all we had planned. They paid for our cab and off we went to the Luana, which we knew nothing about. The front desk staff at the Aqua Aloha Surf told us that the Luana was a better caliber of hotel and we would find it to be an even better stay. So, we arrived at the Luana and were greeted by the front desk. Upon our arrival it became apparent that the staff at the Aqua Aloha Surf only partially notified the front desk at the Luana and so we the displaced travelers, who booked our room almost 5 months before had to go over with the front desk at the Luana our rate, the fact that the Aqua Aloha Surf already charged us for our first night and that they would only be responsible for charging us for 6 nights. We had to review the rate we were going to pay at the Aqua Aloha Surf as it was less than what they were charging at the Luana. We also had to discuss parking fees as we would be renting a car (5 minutes from the Aqua Aloha Surf, now 15 minutes from the Luana) in a few days and we were planning on paying for the parking fees that the Aqua Aloha Surf charged and not what the Luana Charges. We also were going to be given some free breakfast vouchers. This was nice, however, we had not planned to eat there but even that was a fiasco. Initially they showed only one person would be in our room, another error??? So they did not want to give us vouchers for more than 1 person and we would have to check back. We did not need or want them, but if we did, we would then have to waste more time explaining this to the front desk and taking up more of our precious vacation time. When I expressed this to the girl at the front desk, she responded in a condescending manner. Our room was not ready when we arrived but when it was we were fine with the room. It was simple but comfortable and we chose to put all of the aggravation behind us and enjoy our vacation. After returning and speaking to many people in the lodging business, I feel we should have been given a lot more for our inconvenience. The story that the Luana is a much higher scale hotel is all well and good, but they did not offer us anything more than we were going to get at the Aqua Aloha Surf as far as amenities go. I believe we should have been comped a night or upgraded on our room at the very least for this huge inconvenience. In the end I learned a huge lesson, even if you book your hotel well in advance, don’t always expect it to be yours until you arrive. I love to plan our vacations so it won’t stop me from planning them as I do, but at least now I know that this can happen. I am hopeful though it never will again because it started out our vacation in a very unpleasant way.","Atlanta, Georgia","love2traveltogether</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",505,1.0

We had contacted their Sales team to get a government rate, since this was government travel. Their Sales Manager contacted us and offered us some great rates, but after that it went downhill. It was like pulling teeth to get a confirmation, then it was done wrong, then we never knew if the reservation had been made or not. We ended up booking the room ourselves and cancelling with the Sales Manager, and again, we never received a cancellation confirmation email from her.We ended up booking a package that included breakfast and some drink vouchers. When we checked in, the Front Desk had to be reminded that we had the package. No drink vouchers available. Conflictive information in how to solve the problem.Rooms were pretty nice, modern but rather small. There is no privacy as you have a building right across from you. The room however was clean and the daily housekeeping was excellent. The room also had a refrigerator, microwave and dishes.There is no wi-fi in the room, only high speed internet in the room, but the internet was extremely slow. Wi fi is offered for free in the lobby, but since this is the only place with wi fi, there are tons of people there and the internet is very slow.The hotel offers free coffee, tea and water 24 hours, nice touch.Gym is a joke, as it is part of the lobby and it has 3 work out machines.If you book directly you have breakfast included. Breakfast is served in a restaurant that is in the hotel, but privately operated.

Aqua Aloha Surf is perfect for budget conscious travellers, who don't need all the amenities that other hotels offer.Parking is offered in their underground garage at $20 a day.

I chose the Aqua Aloha Surf based on other reviews & a reasonable rate (Avg $149/day). We arrived at the hotel at approximately 5:30 on a Thursday afternoon. The front desk staff were very welcoming, the open air lobby nicely decorated. I had requested a room on a higher floor (there are 16 floors in the Aqua Aloha). They gave us Room 1008, which, they explained was their 'model' room. They are in the process of renovating & they asked us to complete a survey after our stay to rate the room which would help as they plan the rest of their renovations. We loved the room. It was considered a junior suite as it had a king size bed, nice kitchenette, a pull-out loveseat and a good size bathroom. The floor is tile with a nice area rug in front of the loveseat. The 42"" flat screen TV was mounted on the wall above the desk/bureau combination unit. It was a great TV, a lot of available channels. The bed was extremely comfortable, lots of pillows, great mattress. There is an air conditioner unit mounted at ceiling level. It's the quietest a/c unit I have ever had in a hotel room. There was absolutely no problem sleeping with the unit on as the quiet hum was actually very soothing. The only problem, even on the 10th floor, was the noise caused by the garbage trucks going by most days, at about 5-5:30. The other problem is each room has a balcony and on the first 2 nights, the people next door were partying. It felt like they were right in our room. I think the reason is that the window is this slat-type and there was no way to close the slats to keep all the noise out. On the 2nd night, I made myself some earplugs out of tissues & that helped a lot. Luckily, it was just the first 2 nights, after that, all was quiet on the balconies. The view from the balcony was okay, there were some mountain views to the right, but it was mostly high rise apartments/condos that we saw. We didn't spend any real time on the balcony. One note, the A/C unit condensation empties out through a tube that runs through the wall out onto the balcony and the water goes into a large plastic waste basket. Once that waste basket fills up, the water slowly runs over the side, onto the balcony floor, and gradually runs off the balcony. I felt the run off from the balcony above ours. It isn't a stream or anything, just kind of a splash from where the water may have hit the railing. But, I think if I was sitting out there, it would have gotten annoying. The bathroom was great. Only a shower, no tub. But the shower was wonderful, very roomy and the shower head was terrific. Great water pressure and the head itself was the kind with colored lights indicating the how hot the water was. The sink was roomy, the counter was granite. Lots of light & storage. The closet area is in the bathroom and is very narrow. Above the closet is a small safe, which came in handy. Each morning there is a breakfast (included in the room charge) downstairs adjacent to the lobby. When you go, you present your breakfast card and they mark off the day. Each day there are always pancakes, sliced apples, orange wedges, hard boiled eggs, white rice, wheat & Italian sliced bread, mini donuts or muffins and oatmeal. The coffee is very weak, with only powdered creamer. There's better coffee out in the lobby. The juice selection is poor, seems like just Hi-C type drinks. But, it's nice to have the breakfast right there every day. Although, by the last day, I had had enough pancakes! The hotel provides beach towels and sand chairs for each guest to carry down to the beach, which is a nice walk of about 3-4 blocks. Hotel is centrally located to a great area; 1/2 block away from an ABC store, which was great. Many restaurant and shopping choices and just a 1/2 block from the bus stops. By the way, getting around by bus is the only way to go; it's a great system. Be sure to get a bus pass on your first or second day; you'll be glad you did. A four day pass is $35 per person and it is so worth it. You can go almost anywhere on the island with this pass. We went to Diamond Head, Pearl Harbor, Hanauma Bay, and other places via the bus system. I will review the different points of interest separately. All in all, I feel for the price, this hotel was a good choice for us.","shelton, connecticut","donnam57</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>shelton, connecticut</strong>",44,4.0

The closet was spacious with plenty of hangars and had a safe in which to secure valuables. The wall-type air conditioner was adequate and placed in the far corner of the room from the bed; that meant running it on high to sleep in comfortable conditions, but it also meant that there was no cold draft blowing on us during the night (as we have experienced in many other hotels). Even though we were on the 14th floor, and the air conditioner was making its steady noise, there was considerable truck noise starting at six in the morning. We found this to be the case at the Imperial and the Aston as well. Because we booked online directly with the hotel, we were rewarded with daily complimentary breakfasts. Billed by the hotel as a ""continental breakfast,"" it was actually something more than that, including hard pancakes, boiled eggs, griddled pressed ham, hot oatmeal, cold cereal, assorted breads for toast, muffins and the usual hot and cold beverages. We did not use the very small ground floor level pool, and, the times that we passed by it, no one else was using it either. The seats in the lobby were not terribly comfortable, but there was free wi-fi for hotel guests in it. Free cable internet service was available in the rooms. We had a car and so availed ourselves of their 35 space self-park facilities for $20 extra per night. The hotel staff was courteous, professional, helpful and, when not otherwise engaged, friendly and willing to chat. In sum, like many older hotels, this one needs room upgrades, but it suited us fine as a ""good value.""","Carcassonne Center, France","565peterh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Carcassonne Center, France</strong>",6,3.0

Beautiful view of the Ala Wai Canal, golf course, and on the other side - quite a bit of ocean. Only negative comments: 1) the stucco wall rather than grating on the 16th floor, which makes it tough for a short person to see the view when sitting on the lanai. 2) the paint and grouting in the room's bathroom needed touching up (made the room look standard rather than deluxe). All else was good: the bed area of the room was very nice, with a full-wall mirror. Maid staff was exceptional - I left a note requesting flat/soft pillows (the 4 in the room were so high I eventually pillowcased a sofa throw pillow so I could sleep w/o neck pain) and had 2 good pillows when I returned later in the day. One maid even left me a nice thank you note for the day's cash tip. The lobby and exterior of the hotel looked classy.

There were several things that I did not like in the room we stayed in. First our sink became clogged after calling maintenence it was never fixed, there is no actual bathroom door, there is just a pocket door that slides and doesn't lock (not a problem for us as this was a romantic/couple trip) but it might be a little awkward for others who are traveling as friends etc. I also would recommend keeping atleast some of the blinds shut if you are staying on the front side of the hotel as it faces the Sand Villa directly across, we had the misfortune of waking up to see a couple having sex directly across from our room with their blinds wide open......And if we could see them they could see us... (LOL) The pool is very small and there is no hottub which was a big disappointment, as this a boutique hotel they are limited on space but it still was a disappointment. Lastly the daily breakfast buffet that was included in our room was less than desirable, We stayed there for 9 days and we ate the buffet 7/9 days. The only thing that changed on the menu was muffins going to a breakfast type cake and vice versa. After staying here I never wanted to see a pancake again. The daily breakfast menu consists of pancakes, boiled eggs, muffins, donuts or breakfast type cake, (depending on what day it was) white rice, sliced pieces of ham (very salty btw so beware) oatmeal, dry cereal, powdered milk, toast, water and what I thought was orange juice but tastes more like really bad tang. After all has been said I would recommend this hotel and if you aren't partial to the possibility of eating the same breakfast everyday go for it!

But you do not pay for a 5 star hotel... so you should not expect one!!!We had a room with 2 beds, basic cooking facilities, sofa & coffee table + balcony. The bathroom could do with a bit of refurbishing - you enter in a small room with a sink, a safe and a small wardrobe. From there you can access to another small room with a toilet and a shower. The door was half broken - but you could still close it.The shower was a good size but the water would not go down. Surely the bathroom could improve dramatically with some updating.We asked for a quiet room and we were allocated one on a high floor, facing the back. I was very happy about it because Waikiki is noisy. The noise in our room was acceptable - but if would have been much better if the hotel had double-glazing.There is a small pool with 6 or 7 sun loungers, we used it for an hour or so twice during our stay and it was quite nice. There are also a couple of machines (I cannot call it a gym) behind reception - we did not use it but I think it is a nice thought... those who want to keep fit have the opportunity to do so.You can get coffee and tea for free all day at the machine next to the restaurant. if you want special coffee (espresso, etc) you have to pay a small fee. You can get beach towel for free at reception.We had breakfast included and it was ok. The selection offered is a bit limited, but you still manage to find something you like.What I found a bit strange (I have been to many hotels and never seen this before in my life) is that you were only allowed to 2 boiled eggs per person. I obviously do not know if they do it because some people would eat 4 o 5 eggs (I would never dream of it...!!!), but I thought it was strange.Of perhaps eggs in Hawaii are very expensive....now that I think of it, boiled eggs were only available on some days, not every day.As I said, that did not bother me at all - I just found it odd.The breakfast room would transform into a restaurant in the evening, run by a Chinese family. We tried the buffet and it was good value for money.All in all, I was more than happy staying at this hotel. The location is good (those who say it is scary have probably never been to some areas of LA, NY or London!), the room was absolutely fine, the service was good and there are lots of little touches (free tea and coffee, free towels, swimming pool) that put this hotel above other hotels for money conscious travellers,","Munich, Germany","Enjoytraveltheworld</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich, Germany</strong>",183,3.0

Vinh and Nolan (always very helpful) gave us a big smiles upon recognizing us. And a young man who got us two champagne glasses (we didn't get his name) for our room was incredibly kind. The room we had requested turned out to not be available, but Nickie had upgraded us to a beautiful room. We found the top floor to be much quieter for sleeping than the 9th floor had been in the previous year. While Aqua Aloha Surf is in need of renovation, for us, the wonderful people keep us coming back. We did hear that renovations will begin at the end of this year, which is good. Bathrooms are in need of repairs and are out-dated, but they are clean. The bed was great, our view from the top floor was perfect, and, as usual, many folks enjoyed relaxing in the welcoming lobby of the Aloha Surf. This place is perfectly located for walking to Waikiki beach and the shops. And the on-site parking is handy, though spots can sometimes fill up quickly.

It was great to have breakfast included. The place was reasonably clean. We actually even wound up having a view. The location was perfect.

The breakfast was included in our price, but others still have the option to purchase it for $6. It's a simple spread with hard boiled eggs, great pancakes, (watery) porridge, and a variety of breads, biscuits, muffins and some sliced apples and oranges, but really decent value for the price. The mini fridge was fabulous (there is a Food Pantry around the corner.) Our only minor complaint was that the shower curtain was already very mildewy when we checked in--very likely because of the lack of ventilation in the bathroom. However, our housekeeper was extremely adorable, and every time we told her our room didn't need servicing she seemed so perplexed, and still offered fresh towels and toiletries although we declined. It's a great location, close to the main strip and the beach, and they don't charge amenity fees even though you are entitled to borrow towels to go to the beach.

We booked through Thomson and had asked for pretty much bog standard accommodation as we were on a budget - we wanted to spend more money exploring Oahu! Check in was painless and all of the staff were friendly and pleasant enough throughout our stay.Our room was decent for the price we had paid. I had noticed a few reviews saying the standard rooms were small but it was plenty big enough for a couple sharing using it as a holiday base. We were literally only in the room to sleep at night then back in the afternoon after a day out for a nap/shower then back out again. Bathroom was spotlessly clean, in fact the whole room was always clean - the only thing that could've done with more attention were the windows (the slats were very dirty) but this was a minor thing. We had the buffet breakfast included in the rate we paid however we probably only used it 4 or 5 days out of the 14 we were there. There wasn't much variation day to day but the food on offer was (mostly) good quality. The pancakes and muffins were delicious but the juice wasn't too good. Could've done with fresh juice rather than cordial type stuff. We chose to eat breakfast out most days, partially to have a bigger breakfast (then not eat again until evening) and partially due to meeting up with friends to have breakfast with. The hotel is in such a good location, just a couple of blocks to the beach and there are tons of restaurants, bars and shops nearby. Hotel is right by the Ala Wai canal which we'd walk down regularly to get to a friend's place, and also to walk up to Diamond Head (long walk but worth it!). The hotel does have a tiny pool however we didn't use this and didn't see anybody using it the whole time we were there - the sea is only 5 minutes away! Reception staff were very helpful with ordering taxi for our return to the airport (early flight!). All in all, the hotel served it's purpose and if we return to Honolulu would definitely contemplate staying there again, mainly due to the great location.","Wigan, United Kingdom","laurajp203</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wigan, United Kingdom</strong>",8,5.0

We originally rented a ""suite"" with a few friends that was supposed to house six people, which couldn't possibly have been the case unless we were all about 2.5 feet tall. Advice -if you're thinking of sharing a room with others, either get very friendly or just suck it up and pay more for separate rooms. The breakfast was alright, nothing to write home about, but passable.Overall, great location is a good reason to pick this hotel.

(2) Aaron, the concierge in the hotel was a pleasure to meet and full of information about the island and things to do. I had booked the Hummer ""LOST"" tour before coming to the island (which I highly recommend with KOS Hummer Tours) and that is where we first met Aaron. He picked us up at the hotel the morning of our tour and during the day we learned that he worked for Expedia at our hotel and offered to help us with any activities that we wanted to do during our vacation. We stopped by his desk the next day. He helped us find a rental car for our arrival on Big Island at a great price and helped us decide to do a helicopter tour on Big Island and the whale watch on Maui. These are things that we knew that we wanted to do while in Hawaii, he is not at all pushy like a salesman but truly wants you to enjoy and get the most out of your stay.

No matter on what side you get your room, you will have a look onto the balcony of another hotel. The balcony is not equipped very lovingly (two plastic seats, no table, but maybe this is because the balcony is very small) and the room is overall very small. It can also be quite noisy because of the traffic (if your room is next to the public parking, you have the ""pieppiep"" of the trucks of the suppliers going backwards every morning). But altogether it was a pleasant stay there, very clean and friendly staff. You have to face the price! If you want something really great, you have to pay far a lot more..... There is a coin operated guest laundry and you can park your car for 20,- dollars extra a day on the ground floor (may be the public parking right next door is cheaper, but we were too lazy to find out...) My personal opinion to Waikiki beach (being near to this beach was one of the Pros of the Aqua Aloha Surf): Waikiki beach is far supervalued.

Yes there were a few signs of wear in the room. However... the staff was extremely attentive and the room was very, very practical , clean and pest free. The hotel was situated in the middle of Waikiki and only half a block to busses and trolleys, a block and a quarter to car rentals, a quarter block to a grocery store and also an ABC store with more food and sundries. Round table delivers, Chili's is around the corner. Restaurants of many nationalities are nearby. Shaved ice is about three blocks away. The ocean is a two block walk. Bottled water and soda pop is in a machine in the lobby. There is a daily paper. The room is air conditioned, has a coffee maker, microwave, fridge and ironing board with iron. The secured laundry is fairly new, clean and in the parking garage basement. Parking fees are very reasonable compared with other hotels. The hotel features a person who sits at a table in the lobby and will book tours for you. All my tours picked me up at the hotel. I am somewhat disabled, seventy years young and thus booked a room closer to the elevator (which always worked.) My room key never failed. Corazon, the 11th floor maid kept my room in excellent order and well supplied with towels. The help at the desk converted money, called cabs, fixed any problems and answered all my questions promptly. Negatives? A few. Time warner cable TV is very limiting.The high rises around create a canyon effect and multiplys noise.

Maid service was good and employees were friendly. The concierge was helpful. Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives. The beds felt like sleeping on marshmallows--no support (we had two rooms and the same problem in both). Rooms are small and plain, bathrooms are miniscule. The free breakfast was unappetizing--to indicate how much so, know that we ate at Denny's (which my 12-year-old grandson likes--but then he's 12) as an alternative. There are only 2 small elevators for 200 rooms, so the wait can be quite long when guests are trying to get to breakfast between 7-9 am. (In my experience, even cheaper motels on the mainland have at least a 3-hour breakfast window.) The lounge furniture in the lobby was cheap and uncomfortable. The Wi-Fi connection was too slow for my grandson to download a movie on his Kindle. The small TV in the lobby hangs above the elevator doors (really). Parking space in the garage is a joke, plus they charge an extra $20 a night for parking. When we first arrived in our room, I stepped out onto the balcony and noticed the air conditioner had large holes in the grill, lots of rust, and what I think were salt deposits clogging much of the vent. I assumed it wouldn't work, although it actually did (and was needed at night even in December, because there is no air flow through the room). There is no restaurant in the hotel (other than the poor breakfast bar) and it was a hassle seeking out places to eat and waiting in line. Overall, I was disappointed with this room, especially as we were paying $200/night for it. Would not return (but in fairness, I would not return to Waikiki either--overhyped, expensive, crowded. Based on my driving around the island, most anyplace else on Oahu would probably be a more enjoyable alternative.)",Honolulu,"Doc1000000</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu</strong>",2,2.0

It was certainly a functional room with a mini-fridge, microwave and coffee maker, and the bed was comfortable.The shower was not the best shower in the world - a weak stream of water - compared to other hotels, and lacked an exhaust fan so it got quite warm and steamy in the confined space.Wifi was only available in the lobby - something I find a bit frustrating these days. The Waikiki Sand Villa directly across the road has wifi for guests in all rooms (we'd previously stayed there) so it's possible to deliver and this hotel ought to consider it.Self-parking is available for $20 in the small underground carpark but there are < 20 parking spaces for guests, which isn't nearly enough for the hotel. The first night we were able to park underground, but the next night we needed to park in the less-protected parking lot beside the hotel. That only fits another 8-10 cars and the tight maneuvering required meant some people parked across two carparks, further reducing the available parking spots. We got the last park on the second night and I'm not sure what the plan would have been if that had not been available - find your own street park and move the car all day?Overall, the room was functional but the chances of securing a carpark are risky. Given my choice between the deluxe room at this hotel and the deluxe room literally across the street at the Waikiki Sand Villa for the same price (+/- $10), I would choose the latter.","Adelaide, Australia","MQ007b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",110,4.0

House keeping is particularly alert to your needs and noticed that we were travelling with a 3 month old so on the second day gave us an extra set of towels and a bed sheet for his portable cot (without us mentioning anything about it). All of the staff were very friendly and helpful on any matter you wished to bring up, from locations of places to getting the Internet to work in your room. All around, an amazingly pleasant experience and the hotel of my choice on any future visits!I can see others have mentioned the continental breakfast - it was average but it was included with my room so I didn't feel like I got less than I paid for. I'm happy with some toast, cereal, juice, oatmeal, muffins, donuts and fresh pancakes in the morning - if I expected more than this for a continental breakfast, I would have planned to go down the street as this isn't what the hotel needs to supply when located so close to other restaurants!","Sydney, New South Wales, Australia","Seth384</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</strong>",0,5.0

The rooms were clean, quaint and provided with internet connections and free wifi (in the lobby). The rooms also had a microwave, coffee maker, fridge and dishes. They also provide fresh beach towels (as often as you needed) and beach chairs. The cleaning staff were wonderful, always making sure everything was clean (including our dishes -- which was not expected but a nice treat.) We were close to all amenities and within walking distance to the beach, car rentals, stores, restaurants and bars. Great value for the money.

Our room was tiny, not even room for a regular bathroom door, but a pocket door instead. The bed was very comfortable and we appreciated the in-room safe and the dorm-size refrigerator. The room did have a/c, but with windows that don't fully close, the room never seemed to get to a completely comfortable temperature for me. And with windows that don't fully close, that makes for waking to all the morning noises that you find in a city, too. The free breakfast was ok. We were disappointed that the pool was closed for maintenance the 3 days we were there, but when we saw the pool, it wouldn't have mattered anyway - it was about the size of a large hot tub. (When you can walk 2 blocks and be at the ocean, why would you need a pool? It would have been nice to take a dip the evening we got there because it was dark and too late to head for the ocean, but a refreshing swim would have been great.) The staff were nice, the room was clean. My only major complaint is parking. In a 16 story building (I think) there were 24 ... yes, that is right, 24 parking spots in the garage. We got the last spot and didn't go anywhere that we had to drive until we checked out, fearing we wouldn't get another spot. The desk staff told us there was parking lot parking available at the end of the building if it was needed, but the neighborhood isn't great-I'm pretty sure we saw people 'casing' cars there, and I'm glad we were able to park in at least somewhat protected area. (Even that 'parking lot' appeared to hold no more that a few cars.) I guess most people take taxis there or something?? Back to the neighborhood ... always felt safe in the day time. Wouldn't have felt safe walking alone at night up to the hotel from the beach and shopping area, but I wasn't alone and felt fine. Overall, if we were staying in the area for a night or two, we'd go back to this property - inexpensive, clean, friendly staff, and close to Waikiki without the enormous pricetag of other ""name-brand"" hotels in the area. However, if we were staying longer than a couple nights, I think we'd find something else ... ok for short stays, but too small and too confining (rooms and parking) for an extended stay for us.","Twin Cities, MN","Shatom J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Twin Cities, MN</strong>",3,4.0

If I had to rate it for the service of the hotel employees, I would have given it 5 stars, A+, no reservations. The man at the concierge desk always greeted me by name whenever I came down the elevator, the staff was extremely helpful and very friendly, and any questions I had were immediately addressed. The service was absolutely stellar. The hotel is located almost on Ala Wai, although it is still within easy walking distance to the beach.But the room itself? I'm not sure how old the Aqua Aloha is, but my friend and I requested a double room for our stay, and I couldn't believe how tiny it was. And it had two TWIN beds. I didn't think hotels even came with twin beds anymore. The shower was kind of on the scary side and I didn't want to go in without slippers; it wasn't dirty per se, it just looked very very old. Also, nothing annoys me more than bathrooms with standalone sinks and no countertops. Ladies, I think you know what I mean. The lights wouldn't come on at least once while we stayed there, but as soon as we called the front desk someone came up immediately to fix the problem. We drove to Waikiki, so we needed parking at the hotel and I have to say, RENT A SMALL CAR. The parking lot is extremely tiny and cramped, and if they had a valet service I didn't see it. We also had a lower-level room, with a view of nothing except the roof of the next building. There was also some sort of construction going on in the street out front while we were staying there, although I can't blame the hotel for that.So in the end it was very hard for me to rate this hotel, perhaps it was just the choice of room, if we had splurged it might have been much nicer. In the end I would probably not stay here again, I would go for a more updated hotel closer to the beachfront.","Los Angeles, California","kairynel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",42,3.0

The location is fantastic being two blocks from the beach and a grocery store right around the corner. Also close to restaurants and shopping if you want to do that as well. I loved that the hotel provided beach chairs and towels for use for free since their pool was under renovation. The only thing that bugged me was that I was ignored several times when I approached the front desk by the attending staff. Then I received a surprised look by them when they realized that I was standing right in front of them. Also, I only had the breakfast only once. I would suggest the hotel keep it simple. Just coffee, real orange juice (not Tang), and pastries.

Just don't expect it to be a Westin or a W!Strengths: There are lots of things to recommend this hotel. 1. The room was nice. The room we got was well equipped - there was a sofa, a center coffee table, and kitchen amenities such as a microwave and a fridge.2. The hotel is quite centrally located. It is <5 minutes from the Waikiki Beach. Tour buses also stop at this location.3. Free beach towels and free beach chairs are a very nice perk. I have stayed at other beach hotels too in Hawaii and elsewhere but I have not found any hotel to offer free beach chairs. But given that those folks did offer free beach chairs, we could take those with us to the beach and use them.4. A filling continental breakfast was offered with our reservations and that was nice and filling. The person making pancakes was really fast and the pancakes were simple but very good!5. There was a person from Expedia (Bianca) right next to the front desk who really helped us get reservations for a Circle Island Tour and a Snorkeling Trip the next day at very short notice. If she is available, you could certainly speak with her and have her help you in your trip planning.6. The check-out process was also smooth.Room for improvement: Not much for the price that they offer. But since I am a nitpicker, I will point something out: While they are located close to the Waikiki Beach, the particular street on which they are located is dark and a little shady. The hotels/ hostels right next to it also look a little shady. I asked my wife about it as we were headed back to our hotel one night about whether she would have been comfortable walking by herself and she said that she wouldn't. But then again, it is nothing to be seriously concerned about.","Villanova, Pennsylvania","desimba</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Villanova, Pennsylvania</strong>",93,4.0

The lobby is nice (the only place where there is Wifi) and the front desk workers are very nice and helpful. The hotel's polices are a little stingy and stingy extends to the hotel room. We stayed in a double deluxe room. It had a pull out couch, a twin bed, and a full bed (a little odd). Im not going to complain about the beds being uncomfortable or small but I have to say the room was small and dirty. The bathroom was extremely small and an adult man could not fit in the shower (which did not work properly). The toilet did not flush right, I didn't want to touch anything in the bathroom, and the weirdest thing was the card key- electricity. To get the power to work in the room you had to leave your card key in the door (get an extra key). I understand they are trying to conserve energy but give an extra key... The hotel may be okay for one person, a couple, or maybe 2-3 close friends, but not a family of four. Bottom line, don't book if you have 3 or more people (and you better be close buddies)The only reason I gave it poor is because the front desk staff was nice and helpful","Kaneohe, Hawaii","Sally C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaneohe, Hawaii</strong>",18,2.0

We were deciding between paying much more for a fancier hotel or going the budget route - because we wanted to explore the Island and not stay indoors, we chose the latter and are very glad we did. Upon booking, and based on previous reviews to book on a higher level, I requested that we be placed in a room on levels 4 and above - on check-in, lovely Helene who also speaks French gave us a room on the 15th floor with unbeatable views of the coast, the city and the mountains. Our room was quite small but I think that was mainly because they stuffed a king bed in there - not that it mattered since we weren't inside much except to sleep! The bed was slightly soft for my liking but after a day of snorkelling, surfing and driving around, I can fall asleep on anything! The room was clean, air con not even necessary since the nights were so cool. My only qualm is that our toilet sink would spray every which way if you cranked it on - not too fussed though, we just had to let it trickle. The location is also great because you're close to all the action but far away enough for it not to be too busy.All in all, it was a great stay despite the fact that we didn't really spend much time in our room - I suppose that is the way you want it to be when in Hawaii.

Also it's a little out of the way, so it is in a quieter area than other hotels.The rooms are clean and well maintained by the staff, and importantly the beds are excellent.

The staff were really friendly and helpful and Tim and his offsider did a great job bartending with the free ""Wipeouts"" on Tuesday! We had an issue with an air conditioner and a sofa bed, and these were fixed promptly. Some things that could be improved upon are that the hotel rooms and corridors are a bit tired and need some minor cosmetic TLC.

I stayed with my sister for 2 days and 1 nite in this hotel and I was very disappointed that the room is so tiny and the one bed it has appears to be only a full bed and not a King size. The batbroom is another disappointment as it has only a sink basin and no place to put all your toiletries. Although they volunteer to switch us to a different room, my sister decided not to be bothered...which was a big mistake! I tried calling other hotels nearby for another nite stay since my sister is leaving one day ahead but all of them cost too much for my budget. I decided to go downstairs at the front desk to find out how much it would be to stay another nite. They quoted me $79 per nite ...which was ridiculous since I know that room we were staying is only worth $59 thru discounthotelshawaii.com (i think this is the website). But at $79 that's the cheapest i could find that day! I went ahead and got it anyway but continue to complain about how tiny the room was and that there' s no vanity table in the bathroom for toiletries. The front desk guy suggested that we check out first and then he will find me a better room later on as they are pretty full that day. My sister and I toured the city and when i returned later on that day I was pleasantly surprised that he upgraded me to a much better room....bigger one with bigger bed, with a balcony overseeing a beautiful view, a bathroom with vanity table and a lot more....I was a happy camper then and very appreciative for a GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE..

It was centrally located so we were able to walk every evening all over Waikiki. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Our room was just right. We upgraded to a Superior with a King bed and got a corner room with a lanai. For staying eight days, we never felt cramped in our room. There is always city noise in Waikiki, so don't expect quiet. We were on the 9th floor which gave us a glimpse of the ocean and a view of a lot of buildings, but that was fine for us. Our bed was comfortable, and we appreciated having the mini-refrigerator and microwave for our use. Manager's Welcome Party on Tuesday evening was a treat. We loved the ukelele player and enjoyed the hosted ""Blue Wave"" drinks as we met other travellers in our hotel. Parking for our rental car was $20 a night, which we hadn't anticipated. We learned to get back to our hotel by 5:30 - 6:00 pm in order to secure a parking spot at the hotel, and then we walked in the evenings. They, unfortunately, only have about 30 or so parking spots available, so if it's full, you have to find parking somewhere else in the area. The continental breakfast is served by an independent business in the morning and is mostly just carbs (pancakes, oatmeal, toast, pastries) with hard-boiled eggs being served every third day, but it filled the spot for a while. We appreciated the hotel's coffee and tea machine that is available 24 hours. The rate we got for our room was excellent, everything was clean and nice, and we definitely will stay with Aloha Surf again when we return to Waikiki.","Auburn, California","RomanticAuburnites</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auburn, California</strong>",34,5.0

The solid construction means quiet rooms, and the location puts you a convenient couple of blocks from the main part of what's left of Waikiki Beach and its mayhem, without forcing you to be part of it. There are quieter walks and jogs available along the Canal, down to Kapiolani Park.Rooms are compact but functional, with good beds and bathrooms. There are decent views from the small upper-story balconies, and the fridge, microwave, coffee maker and dishes provided allow you to eat in if you care to. The included breakfast is very weak, but it's a start. The pool is also insignificant, but there's always the beach if you want to get wet.Staff and management make a solid and generally very successful effort to provide plenty of Aloha, with one glaring exception, a desk guy named Lance. When we checked in late at night after a long flight, he was busily screwing up two other parties, even though the solution to their problems was obvious to me after a minute of listening. When his victims took time out to confer with each other, I showed him my voucher, and asked for a registration form. He snapped back that he was helping these other people, which was the opposite of the truth, so I turned to one couple, asked if I'd understood the problem, and suggested the obvious solution, which was adopted. Then someone in an upper room called, obviously repeating a complaint about noisy neighbors, and Lance snapped at him. Finally, he managed to check us in.When we were checking out to catch an early flight to Asia a few days later, there was Lance again. We had prearranged a shuttle with the concierge, and I asked him to confirm which company's shuttle we were booked on, so we could watch for it. He gave us the wrong information, and when a shuttle driver came to the lobby shouting ""Airport"", my wife went and checked with Lance, who snapped that it wasn't the right company. When our supposed shuttle was 15 minutes late, the real concierge arrived, and it turned out that Lance had given us the wrong info, and sent our shuttle away. Fortunately, it was still making its rounds, and picked us up in time to catch our flight to Taipei.A desk clerk should be able to reason and multitask without turning snippy and snarly, but Lance couldn't even task, and he was surly as well as incompetent. I'd gladly stay at the Aloha Surf again based on its reasonable rates and good location, but I'd be way happier if Lance was removing gum from the sidewalk or cleaning bathrooms rather than screwing up reception.",Queen Charlotte,"Bima77</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Queen Charlotte</strong>",244,4.0

It's a great place to visit, but narrowing down just WHERE you'll stay can be very difficult. There's so much to choose from! Do you stay that the expensive all inclusive hotels and waste half your money on amenities, or do a little more research to find out what you'll REALLY need for your stay? I've stayed in Hiltons and Marriotts in the past and they're great, but not really worth the money you pay. I will NEVER stay at a ritzy wine & dine hotel in Oahu. If that's what you're looking for then this isn't the place for you. However, if you're looking for a comfortable clean bed to sleep in.... you can't pass this place up! Seriously one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in. The room was clean and had updated furnishings/decor. Fridge, sink, microwave and eating utensils all included. As far as a hotel ROOM is concerned, this is exactly all you need for your stay in Oahu. There's so much to do in Waikiki alone that you won't be in your room much anyway. The lobby is modern and clean with a full staff 24/7 for your every need. Work-Out equipment is just off the lobby in an indoor/outdoor setting. Small clean pool (I've worked in the hot tub/sauna industry for a few years so pool standards are pretty high) just enough room to cool off and feel comfortable if a couple others happen to join you. The location is absolutely perfect! It's in the middle of Waikiki so you can walk anywhere you need to go. A grocery store (not ABC their prices are ridiculous) is just through the parking lot. They have fresh everything and the best prices I've come across. The ONLY hole in the wall sports pub is not too far away, LEGENDS.... the owner is a very nice man and he keeps polite friendly staff to make you feel at home. If/when I go back to Waikiki I will only stay at Aqua Aloha Surf, it was the right decision for me, and ANYONE looking for a great place to stay without wasting all your spending money on a top dollar hotel. Other than the rooms, amenities, aesthetics of this boutique hotel, the STAFF was absolutely wonderful to us.

Based on the reviews of the Aqua Aloha, I thought I couldn't go wrong...but I was.Pros: Excellent location in terms of being able to walk to any place in Waikiki (the beach, bars, shops and restaurants). ABC store on the corner which was very convienent to grab snacks/beverages to take back to the room. The bed was a decent size and was probably one of the best hotel beds I've ever slept in - very comfortable. Cons: We upgraded to a superior room which was fine but our room (#403) faced a parking lot and, without fail, every morning woke up about 5-5:30am to the sound of garbage trucks or delivery trucks. Our lanai faced an apartment building which was so close, I could see the couple across from us doing their morning exercises. The bathroom is in need of a desperate upgrade. And finally, we were greeted every morning or evening by a cockroach. I realize we're in the tropics and things like this happen but a) this never happened at the Marriott and b) one of them showed up every day on cue.

Two blocks away from the beach, King's Village and Shopping-Clean and quiet (requested to have room to be higher level, away from elevators)-Free breakfast that's pretty decent-Good, quick and nice service-If you are renting a car, its nice because there's free parking half a block away along the canal (or else its 20 bucks to park underground)-The plates/microwave/utensils/fridge etc is huge help! Load up on the water and reheating cheesecake factory leftovers is great.-The beds were comfortable for me as it is soft and sinks in really nicely; however, beware, this can also be a con as my SO found the beds uncomfortable as he likes firmer beds. Cons:-The bathroom was a bit awkward as there was no actual door... it was more of an open-ish sliding door that didn't hide any unpleasant sounds. The tv was constantly cranked up high to provide privacy for my significant other (there were stomach problems)-Our card key did not work several times. We had to change it 4-5 times within a few days-The AC was not cold enough despite blasting it all night-The blowdryer did not work in our room either. It took several phone calls and 3 days to have this replaced -The elevators take a bit long (but really that can't be helped)I think with some maintenance, this hotel can definitely be better!

There were no major issues during our stay and the front desk was helpful and quick to respond to any requests. We jokingly named this the ""Mini Hotel"" because everything is small, but still gets the job done (see full review below).Breakfast - Our room came with the free breakfast which was adequate. It is mostly a variety of breakfast type breads, pancakes and cereal. They do have cut up fresh fruit which was nice and one day they had hard boiled eggs. The lady making the pancakes is super nice and the pancakes are good. The only problem is that they only give you little tiny bread plates which makes it hard to handle - just make multiple trips.Lobby/Pool - The lobby is nice and open air. There is a vending machine that sells beverages at a somewhat reasonable price and a machine that has free regular coffee or $1 fancy coffee drinks. Just off the lobby is an internet cafe and tour company. We didn't use etiher of these, so I can't comment. The pool is tiny and only has a few lounge chairs, so just plan on heading to the beach - you are in Hawaii.Room - Our room was small, which I expected, but had enough space for what we needed. The bed was very comfortable and king sized. The curtains were wearing thin in a few places and didn't slide very well open and closed, but still got the job done. The windows were very clean and our view was great, but they are the crank open slatted windows so they don't block out much noise. There is an air conditioner in the room, but we never needed to turn it on. If you opened the windows there was enough of a breeze to keep things comfortable. The room had a balcony, but it was only large enough for two patio chairs. There is a mini-fridge and a tiny microwave. There is also a safe, but it was too small to fit a regular size laptop. The room overall was clean, but looks like it could use a floor to ceiling cleaning because many of the walls had dirt spots on them. In regards to the noise issue mentioned in other reviews, it is loud. Even on the higher floors away from Ala Wai, it is still loud. So, if you have sensitivity to noise when sleeping, bring ear plugs. The noise bothered me the first night, but I got used to it after that. My boyfriend, on the other hand, never adjusted and needed his earplugs.Location - The location was perfect for our needs which was visiting friends who live in the area. If you are looking for a place very close to the water, then you will be disappointed. It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the Kalakaua Ave which is the main street along the beach. It then takes another 3 minutes or so to actually get through the hotels and out to the beach. It isn't too bad, but it isn't a quick trip down to the beach. There a a number of restaurants of varying price and type nearby, a Food Pantry grocery store a block away, and, of course, a number of ABC Stores.","San Diego, CA","Vacationgirl_0707</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, CA</strong>",42,4.0

We were also close to the bus stop, which was perfect for us. the room was very clean and was cleaned well throughout our stay.

I have been to Waikiki 7 times and in all my trips have stayed at an Aqua Resort, including the Aloha Surf. The first time I stayed there was great, so much so I talked the rest of my family into staying there on our return trip. I was offered a good rate for being a returning customer, however if they would have told me that I would be treated so poorly, I probably wouldn't have taken the offer. The first problem was a combination of miscommunication on both my part and theirs. We had got the dates of our arrival mixed up, and we turned up a day before they were expecting us and they had no rooms. I had called the hotel twice prior to arriving to confirm and not once anyone mentioned that they had a different date for us. Because of this, my mother, grandmother, sister in law and brother in law, my partner and my 5 month old baby and myself (6 adults and a baby) had to stay in one room for the first night. No one was overly apologetic for this, however at least we had somewhere to sleep. The next issue we had was our airconditioner was extremely loud, as well as our toilet, as they had maintenance issues with it, so we could not flush at night as it would wake our baby, it was that loud. I was also called at 10pm at night to go down to reception to sign a form in regards to beach towels etc, which they forgot to ask me to sign on check in. When I asked if I could come down in the morning as I was trying to get my baby to sleep, they said no and that I had to go down once the baby was asleep, nevermind I was in my PJ's and dead tired. This was my 2nd night so its not like they couldn't get me to sign it in the next 10 days we were there! It is in a loud location, so I wouldn't recommend anyone with a baby to stay there. However, it is close to the supermarket and not far from the beach.They take $100 bond on check in, which is fine, but we then realised they had not only taken $100 for a bond but $1000 on top of this. When we asked them about this they said it was hotel policy, so too bad if we wanted to access that money while we were there and to pay by another form of payment. They didn't mention this to us either on check-in, only discovered it when checking our account. This also caused problems on checkout as the money had been frozen (because of them) and then when we went to check out they couldn't unfreeze it and then asked for another credit card to finalised payment. We ended up walking out to catch our flight and leaving it with them to sort out as it was 5.30am and they wanted us to call our bank (in another country) to get the money unfrozen, which again, they froze in the first place without our permission. For the entire stay I felt like I was a pain, even though we asked for nothing from them and didn't complain about anything while we were there. I'm not sure what has happened with the Aqua chain over the last couple of years but it wasn't what I have remembered and would not recommend anyone staying there again.","Melbourne, Australia","renee1980</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",4,1.0

She then told us they didn't have any rooms available. After a 10 minute wait, she was able to find a room for us. The room was tiny. The couch in the room was covered with stains it was disgusting.The bathroom was also tiny, it will only accomodate one person at a time. Their was no tub for my children to bathe in. The bathroom didn't even have a normal door. It was a sliding wooden door without a lock that didn't even shut completley. The balcony is no place for children! I piled up all the luggage infront of the door to make sure the kids didn't make their way out there. During our stay, people were running up and down the halls, yelling, and slamming doors well into the wee hours of the morning. Thankfully the kids never woke up but I didn't get much sleep. The area the hotel is located in can be a little scary at night. Paking is minimal and expensive. Elevators were slow. This is not the place to stay if you have kids.

It was so small I don' t know how they got the furniture in. For a small fee we upgraded to a nicer (larger) room on an upper floor (actually the one TripAdvisor uses for the hotel's profile pic). WELL WORTH the minimal fee. There's an ABC store downt the street - there's an ABC store down every street come to think of it - and you can walk down and get snacks and frosty beverages and take them back to your room to save some extra $$. I love getting their tuna roll & other triangle shaped hand rolls for breakfast.This hotel is totally cute too. They have a free cocktail mixer on one of the nights and they don't make you feel very welcome and not like a cheapskate for drinking a few (10) cups of the delicious drink the manager made.Most of the time you're out and about in Honolulu but we slept like kittens while here.It felt clean and not creepy.

My last visit was the week of 1/10-1/17/2012. I was extremely surprised at the poor service. The rooms were not cleaned properly, there were dishes left in the sink, complimentary coffee was not provided daily, and the shower area smelled like mildew. When I called the desk to ask for coffee, I was told that I had to go downstairs and get it myself. The personnel at the front desk were rude and unwilling to help. The people at the continental buffet were rude and unfriendly. I mentioned that the pancakes were cold and the lady touched it with her fingers and then put it back on the grill to serve it to someone else. There were no bowls to put the cream of wheat into, so I was given a syrofoam cup to use. I have always recommended your hotel to all my friends and family because it was clean, friendly and convenient.

Both of these had a similar feel to them and I understood why when I found out that the Aqua-hotels also run the Best Western I stayed at earlier. The location is pretty good (a few blocks from the beach, close to major bus lines) being both fairly central and still quiet.The check-in experience was not exactly the best. The guy at the front desk seemed less than happy having people disturb him. We arrived at around two and were told the room was not ready yet. In a sense it was fine since check-in time was at three but usually they can provide one clean room an hour before check-in (especially when they had a sign with vacancy outside the entire time we stayed there) but service did not appear to be at the top of the agenda. No offer to take care of our bags so asked if they could store and then was told it would be possible. Returned at three and the room was ready then, it was however now a lady at the front desk and had to go through showing passport (ID-card was not accepted and) providing credit card details again. The pace that she worked at was probably the slowest I ever seen - took around 10 minutes for her to just check passport, get the credit card details and then just hand us the key.The room was on a high floor and it was a pleasant surprise. The room was larger than expected with room for a sofa and table in addition to the bed. The view from the balcony was also better than expected,could see both the ocean and the river. The room also had a sink where they also placed a microwave oven, kitchen utensils, coffee maker and a fridge. The decor was however a bit worn but must admit that it was not without charm. What we could however done without was the paper thin doors. In combination with a very loud cleaning lady (she was constantly screaming, talking etc in the corridor) did not make it easy to sleep in.In the bathroom there was only a shower with not the best water pressure and it was fairly small but still sufficient. The main negative about the room was the fact that there was no WiFi - I was surprised that any hotel these days do not offer WiFi in the room. Wired internet was acceptable 10 years ago now but these days it is just not good enough to only have WiFi in the lobby. The breakfast that was provided was not good - poor selection and quality and the breakfast was only open from 7 to 9 and when we showed up at 8.50 one day there was almost no food left - asked for some additional things but was just told that this was what they had. Was then rushed to finish before 9 - not that difficult since there was almost no food.There is a pool that is fairly ok in size but it was a bit cold and also almost no sun so not the best place to hang out but I would imagine most people prefer the beach. There is also a tiny fitness center (three machines and one of these, the treadmill, was broken). Nice added benefit was however they provide beach towels free of charge.Price-wise the hotel is still a decent deal but I do believe that there are better options in the same price range (for example I would rather stay at the Best Western Coconut that I stayed at earlier). Would probably not repeat the stay here next time mainly due to the lack of service attitude among the personnel, poor breakfast and lack of WiFi in the rooms.","Stockholm, Sweden","thesaint01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",178,3.0

I picked the hotel initially based on the reviews on trip advisor. And boy were the reviews right- great room for great price, great location and great atmosphere. Warm and friendly staff and free brekky! The only issues really 1. Would prefer a kettle instead of a coffee machine that way could have tea or coffee option. 2. It wolud great if free internet was avaible in rooms wireless - it was hard as there were not too many power outlets to plug in your laptop. We had no qualms staying there on our return to Waikiki. I have been slow to Put in a review, but from the recent reviews , it sounds like the standards are being maintained. Hawaii was such a lovely surprise experience for us, in that I didn't really have any expectations. mainly as I am not really a beach goer (plus we have great beaches here in Sydney). but was so blown away by the wonderful people and thewonderful place it is.

A lot has changed in a decade since I was last here. The hotel had been sold and renovated. Its a bit more modern and tried to look trendy but theres nothing fancy about it. Its a 2 star, barely, and I didnt expect much. I got what I expected for $80. Booked on line thru expedia and stayed in late November.I had a single room with a queen bed. My room was 200 square feet. Yes thats right 200 sq ft including the bath room. For those who arent good with math a queen size bed takes up about a third of that area and the bath room the other third. Also crammed in there was a desk a night stand and a mini fridge with microwave. It was cozy to say the least. Im glad it was just me. There would have been no room for a wife any way. The bed was comfy with good linnen. The bathroom had only a shower, no tub. Thats the way it was a decade ago. My room was on the 2nd floor with a scenic view of the top of the lobby canopy and air conditioning units. The pool was ice cold. I dont understand why on Oahu other than expensive energy costs, they dont heat the pools. Its like they dont want people to use them. All the pools on Maui are heated. Wifi in the lobby. Internet in the room is free but requires cat 5 cord which they will loan from the front desk. They also loaned nice beach towels out too.On Wed night the manager has a blue hawiian cocktail party that was a nice touch. Staff were friendly and helpful. Theres a full grocery store at the end of the block. The beach is 2 and a half blocks away.One thing they need is a courtesy room or poolside change room with showers for guests to freshen up at if they have a late flight out. I cant believe Mexico is ahead of Hawaii on this.This is a cheap, clean basic hotel.

The hotel is somewhat dated (but has been revamped in recent years). It is centrally located (near many shops and transport modes) and not far from the main beach. The hotel's lobby area is spacious, comfortable, welcoming. The rooms are clean, tidy, comfortable, adequately equipped with the essential utilities. Staff are genuinely friendly, polite, competent, efficient, accommodating. The hotel Manager (Tim Clark) is an excellent manager who is very friendly and genuinely listens to his hotel customers. I personally know of very few managers who seem to constantly monitor customer feedback (on sites such as Trip Advisor) and genuinely make the effort to address negative feedback. One such example is the hotel's internet availability: Earlier in the year I (whilst I was planning our Hawaii itinerary) I had noticed (through TripAdvisor) that there had been some criticism of internet unavailability in the hotel's rooms; this matter was certainly resolved by the time of our stay. Regarding noise, many of the hotel rooms seem to be equipped with louvres (rather than glazed windows); when these louvers are not (or do not) shut properly, the room air conditioners are forced to work constantly and give rise to elevated (but tolerable) noise levels. For those who happen to be spending Tuesday night at the hotel, take the opportunity to enjoy the Manager's Happy Hour- free cocktails accompanied by a free sideshow of entertainers including musicians, magicians and masseurs! (quite a spectacle, particularly for kids!). In summary: This hotel is quite comfortable, enjoyable, good-value for the standard of accommodation it provides (and particularly suited for visitors of all ages on average travel budgets). Hotel staff are friendly and the hotel Manager (Tim Clark) is a genuinely caring Manager to deal with. Highly recommended.

After a 7 night cruise we made our next stop at this location. We arrived in the morning from our cruise - about 10:40 AM and we were told that our room was not ready and would not be ready until at least 12:30 PM. We kind of expected that and I knew this hotel has laundry facility so we asked if we could go do that first. Our front desk check in person appeared to be quiet, soft spoken and not the most helpful. He did tell us we could leave our suitcases safely with them - but did not tell us where laundry was, or that we needed a key, nor how to find the laundry room itself! We eventually found the basement location - a small room tucked away back in a corner - locked for safety - with 2 washers and dryers. Now although the cost of the machines was good - one washer leaked and there was a puddle of water in the corner and the room smelled musty. Someone had a wash on and a drying on and the washers run quickly and the dryer goes for a long time so we spent all of our time there waiting for the drying person to come back and take out their stuff so we could finish our washing! The room iyself was very hot and the vent came out right outside the door so it was a sauna around the area - no place to sit and I had no faith to go and leave our stuff unattended! Also the dryer vent screen was loose and so a lot of lint stuff flying around - in fact some bikes parked outside the door were covered in lint. A little care could be given to this area!Once we were done laundry, our room was ready. We only had a double bed and a single bed and after having had 2 queens at the last hotel - this was a little disappointing. The room itself was adequate and did have a couch which was a nice change and much more comfy to sit on. We also had dishes which previous hotel did not - we were able to purchase food items we bought from the Food Pantry - a block away - and save ourselves some money and provide convenience. The small fridge was inside a cupboard and seemed to be running quite hot when the door was closed - we left the cupboard door ajar and it seemed to work better.The Air conditioner was located in the far corner, beside the couch and down by the floor. It was extrememly difficult to get the whole room down to a bearable temp as the air does not circulate like it should. We never did feel comfortable unless stting right beside couch and I found myself getting up in the night and sleeping on the couch for awhile to cool down. Previous location had central air - much better!Pool area was small - but ok area and a BBQ for customer use as well as nice wicker loungers and cushions. We actually enjoyed the pool several times. There is also a nice seating area - open air - with table and chairs - all part of the lobby area that was quite nice. Large TV in lobby, water to drink etc. No view from our room what so ever, not that it was a huge deal and although it was up one block off of Kuhio - was no where near as convenient as previous Aqua Hotel. The room cleaner - we asked only for clean towels and more coffee on the 2nd day so she got off lightly. On the next day we were out - but she left no coffee, no spare Toilet Paper but left extra towels. To be fair - we could have gone and asked for it - but it was annoying just the same.We did have occasion to ask other questions of the front desk staff and found everyone else to be completely friendly and helpful. I had no problem booking a spa appt, getting directions or getting my boarding passes printed. I took advantage of the Early Bird Spa Special on the day my son went golfing and highly recommend it!

I stayed 4 nights (Tues. - Fri.) in Oct. '11. Staff was friendly. All inquiries were handled smoothly & immediately. Room was very clean, bed was incredibly comfy, excellent water pressure in shower & all room amenities were new and in good working order. No problems with noise from other guests or staff - very quiet in that respect. Location can't really be beat especially for the price, but the trade off is you should expect noise. I was on the 12th floor (street side) and had street noise until about 11 pm. Slept soundly. Woke up to garbage trucks at 6 am but easily went back to sleep once they moved on. Despite upgrades, hotel shows its age & is a no-frills type of place. Only vending area was in the lobby. No valet & apparently no bellhops (not a big deal to me), but they did have a friendly security guy who wasn't bashful about doing his job. Parking is $20/night self-parking in area below lobby & lot next to hotel. (Tip: If you think you might rent a car, reserve it before your trip on a daily basis but be aware of return times. Easier to cancel a reservation than to try to get a car on a walk-in basis.) Room was on the small side - roughly 12'x14' and had no seating, simply the bed or the floor. Other rooms might offer more, but because I was traveling alone I was simply looking for an inexpensive place to sleep & shower, with a few specific amenities. No bathtub, only small shower stall, but again, had excellent pressure so no complaints. TV had your typical ABC, NBC, CBS fare. No premium channels. Overall, rough around the edges, but tries & was more than satisfactory for what I needed/wanted. Must say I know people who would NOT have stayed there and if I'd been traveling with a companion, might have upgraded a bit (something nicer in the same hotel?) but was fine for just me. Would recommend to certain personalities, but not for everyone. Again, solid 3+, but not a place if you're looking for luxury.","Galesburg, Illinois","Patty A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Galesburg, Illinois</strong>",12,3.0

We booked this vacation through discounthawaiicarrental.com. We had originally booked the standard room but called ahead of time to upgrade the room to a superior room based on the reviews here. At check in the front desk seemed a little stressed from being busy, probably could have used another person but was nice to us, this seemed to be the same each time we needed the front desk. I parked the car after check in which is $20 per day under the hotel. There’s not much parking under there, although we did find a spot each day, there’s also additional parking nearby if it’s full.Our room was on the 14th floor which had a nice view of the city and balcony which we enjoyed. The room was still very small. Which made us glad we upgraded, can’t imagine how small the standard room would have been. Room had a fridge, small TV, we did have a king bed which was very comfortable. The bathroom was ok, very small vanity separated from the business side of the bathroom.The continental breakfast was included with our room, which we had 2 of the 3 mornings. It was good considering other continental breakfasts hotel try to serve you. Other things: The lobby was very nice and open air as is much of Waikiki. We arrived on a Tuesday which had the manager’s reception which was nice. Free drinks, free 5 min chair massages (sign up early cause the line gets long). There’s a small pool which you would probably only use for a quick refresher, not really for lounging. They offer towels for use at the beach at the front desk.Overall: It’s an above average budget hotel, rooms are really all that, but the location is good as well as the amenities and price.

Unfortunately I was told at the time I booked a few weeks before that we would have a room with 3 beds and found they only had a queen with sofa bed available to us.

However, after I reminded them of being promised the extra bed, they did put us in a room like we wanted the next night.  I did feel the quality of one of the rooms was a little lacking--the curtains were broken and had holes in them, and the air conditioner did not work very well.

After some research, I decided to go with the Aloha Surf and Spa Hotel as I had read good things about it. The price was low and the service was fantastic. On Tuesdays, they have a complimentary happy hour in which they serve a cocktail they make (the name slips my mind), and my friends and I loved it. Craig and Ofelia were so nice, and they just seemed so happy to go around the lobby, giving out chocolates and pouring their signature cocktails into empty glasses. Our room was great, and much to our surprise came with a microwave, coffee pot, and fridge. The location of the hotel is wonderful as well - just a few blocks from the main shopping streets, and a half a block from a beautiful canal that is perfect for jogging along. Everything is near by, which is what I look for in a hotel. Combine it with the price, and you've got a winner. The only minor setback is the breakfast - it is $4.95 for some pancakes, muffins, toast, and oatmeal. Personally, I dont think it's worth the price. If it was complimentary, then that would have been great. But given the small selection, I'd go elsewhere for breakfast.But regardless of that set back, I still gave it an excellent rating - I think the hotel is absolutely wonderful and I recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in Honolulu.

It's a good budget hotel, but I would stress that it is definitely a budget hotel. My interactions with the front desk staff was limited but they all seemed very nice. The Tuesday happy hour hosted by the manager was delicious. The location is very convenient right off of the two main-drags of Waikiki. The room was ok sized and the bed was comfy. However, the sofa was clearly stained and the curtains were pretty shabby and had cuts in them. The vanity area was very fine. The bath/shower was ok but it clearly needed to be updated. I know some people would have not accepted the minor stains under the tub faucet. I like the power saving feature I've seen a lot in Europe with the door key but it was frustrating to have to reset the time on the clock every night b/c it lost power every time I took my keycard out of the slot. The window a/c unit had a nifty remote but unfortunately the a/c is poorly positioned. It blows the cool air right onto the side of the sofa, which prevents it from getting across the room to the bed. The flat screen tv was fine but having a paper channel listing would have been nice.As other reviews have mentioned, the breakfast is pretty bad. I've seen a lot of continental breakfasts and other than the freshly made pancakes, it is the worst I've ever seen. Besides the pancakes, you have the choice of sliced apples and oranges, small grocery store bought muffins, some bread to toast and what looked like angel food cake. Plus some punch type drink. It was included in the price of my room but if not you can purchase it for $5. I'd go to IHOP instead.

Free breakfast is served in the lobby each day, again fairly basic, but exactly what we were looking for; a good selection of breads, eggs, fruits, juices, and coffee. There is a small pool out back, but as many others have commented, with the beach so close, why go to the pool?The underground parking garage is small, and on our first trip to the Aloha Surf, we found ourselves having to park in the lot next to the hotel; no extra charge, but just something to keep in mind, be sure to request your spot early. The day after our wedding we made use of the small, yet affordably priced spa to book a few last minute massages. The therapists were great, and made every effort to accommodate us, even though our booking very last minute. Throughout our stay the entire staff were gracious and helpful, always working hard to make sure that we were taken care of. It's worth noting because it's the staff that can make or break a stay, and every time we've been to this hotel all of the staff have made us feel welcome.In short, it was a great stay, and the Aloha Surf is a great place, we enjoyed our time there, and we're looking forward to visiting again soon.","San Diego, California","mikediliberto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",34,4.0

I was only in Honolulu for 3 nights, and this was the only time we didn't have a rental car. We mainly went to the island to see the typical tourist attractions Pearl Harbor, Polynesian Cultural Center, State Capitol and more. I booked this hotel as part of a package that included my air to the islands, and all inter-island flights, in addition to package tours on this island. I had other arrangements for lodging and transportation on the 3 other islands we visited.The hotel was clean and provided a continental breakfast every morning. This is very nice and can save you lots of money in a place where everything is expensive. They also have free copies of the local newspaper available to help you keep up with the rest of the world. This is sometimes difficult to do because of the time difference. I landed on the island right after the news broke about the death of Osama bin Laden. I read all about it the next morning in the free paper.The hotel is just a few blocks from Waikiki beach and all the ""fancy"" hotels, yet costs just a fraction of what they charge. The hotel will ""loan"" you beach towels to take to the beach. Our room was on the 11th floor near the top and we had a small, but nice balcony. Depending on the time of year, you can open all the windows and get a great breeze through the room. A unique thing about the room is that there is a master control switch for all the electricity in the room. You insert your card key into a slot on the wall to activate the entire room. If you don't have the card, then you don't have any power. This is kind of strange, but I think it is a great way to conserve power! How many of us leave our rooms for the day, with the A/C cranked and every light on? There is a small refrigerator and a FREE safe in each room as well. We went to the ABC store on the corner and purchased a bottle of rum and had a few cocktails in the room. We took the remainder of the rum (in my wife's purse) on our trip to the Polynesian Cultural Center. It is a great place, but (since it is run by the Mormons) there is no alcohol on the premises. During the Luau there, we added the rum to our punch for a little extra kick. We were close to the pickup locations for our charter tours, and close to lots of shopping and dining. I would stay here again. There is also a city bus stop a few blocks away which we utilized as well. The rooms are not big by any stretch. The bathroom is tiny and has a pocket door.

Yes this is a value hotel but the staff is super friendly and very accommodating. The room was simple but was clean. The location can't be beat, it was a short walk to the beach-walk/ international marketplace but you didn't have to deal with all the annoying traffic and noise. The lobby was tastefully decorated and comfortable, so when we went downstairs to use the wifi, it didn't feel awkward. We weren't expecting a luxury hotel. We wanted a clean and inexpensive room, in a good location and that is exactly what we got. Our only complaint was that the room air conditioner could have been a little more effective.

The regular rooms are clean and small, with a microwave and a refrigerator. We were able to fit leftovers in the fridge and microwave them for lunch the next day. If you get a good price and are on a budget, this is a good option. The beach is a short five to ten minute walk away and the hotel will give you beach towels. The staff are nice. By saving money here, you could also splurge on a nice meal at one of the beachfront hotel restaurants. We did not eat at any, but a few came highly recommended by the hotel staff and some of the O'ahu guidebooks. Plan on spending a bit though for these. Avoid Jimmy Buffet's and the Surfboard Museum, unless you like over-priced drinks and food at a ""touristy"" place. Spend your money at the nicer beachfront restaurants or at one of the local bars. I would not recommend for a long stay unless you fully vette out the suites. It may be comfortable, but for the single rooms they are small and have no kitchenette. The continental breakfast is so-so. Five bucks gets you pancakes, donuts, and oatmeal. There is a restaurant one or two blocks toward the ocean that will give you a nice full plate and coffee for about eight dollars. I'd recommend that. Tuesdays be sure to go to the manager's reception from 5 to 6 pm where the hotel serves it's free specialty mixed drink and provides entertainment (live music, massage table, and magician). General O'ahu tip: no need to rent a car. While it may seem that taking the buses and shuttles come out to about the same price as a rental, don't forget about paying for overnight parking at the hotels. This can run you up to $40 a night. You might be able to find a deal, but check it out. We found that the buses were clean and safe and the shuttles took you wherever you want, including Pearl Harbor.","Illinois City, Illinois","Kevin A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Illinois City, Illinois</strong>",36,3.0

We chose this hotel because of the reasonable price, decent Tripadvisor rating, and the continental breakfast. We decided that we would rather have a longer trip at a cheaper hotel, then shorter at somewhere more expensive... in hindsight, I probably wouldn't do that again. Lobby: the lobby looks pretty good when you first arrive, but the front desk service was a little slow. Not a big deal, I mean you're on vacation so where do you have to go? But for what it's worth, it was slow.Room: So the room was pretty pathetic. I mean I understand that it's Waikiki so there isn't a lot of space but the room was TEENY TINY! I have never ever been in a smaller hotel room. The bathroom had a pocket door because there wouldn't be any room for a real door, and although there was a full size closet, you couldn't get to half of it because the bed/nightstand completely covered it. The TV was pretty small and wasn't centered with the bed, so that was kind of weird. I've read a lot of reviews that have said ""the room is small, but how much time do you spend in there anyway."" But I'm telling you this room was itsy-bitsy no matter how much or how little time you spend. I would definitely not recommend the room for more than 2 people and that's pushing it. Breakfast: My husband and I aren't very picky about food so we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast... especially since it was free. But as many people have said, the selection is pretty limited. They made pancakes every morning and then had 2 mini donut options and 2 fruit options. They also had oatmeal, coffee and hot water. There's just something different about the pineapple in Hawaii so I filled up on that every day! Our main issue was breakfast was the limited serving hours. It was pretty early for us, so we missed it a couple times, and more than once we ran down in our PJs just to catch it in time. But like a said, free is free, and we enjoyed that.Fitness equipment: was pretty much a joke. I never once saw anyone use it. It was pretty much right in the lobby and it's so hot outside I don't know who would. I think they have the equipment just to say they have it, but everyone knows it's just there for decoration. If I remember correctly it was like 1 treadmill and 1 stationary bike...Pool: Like the room - teeny tiny - but nice enough. A lot of hotels in Waikiki don't even have pools so I appreciated this. We were a little annoyed because they spent about 2 hours cleaning it one day and kept saying they would open in half an hour, but that kept extending. It wouldn't have been a big deal but because they only had 6 lounge chairs, I didn't want to go back up to the room and then get out there and not get a chair. We spent most days at the beach though, so the pool wasn't too much of an issue.Parking: a lot of people have complained about the parking, but it's pretty clear on their website you'll be charged. We just factored it into our budget for the trip so we weren't upset. We always parked in the outside lot instead of underground and never had trouble getting one spot. Overall this hotel was OK. The room was cleaned every day, we had plenty of towels, the front desk was helpful enough and ultimately... you're 3 blocks from the world famous Waikiki beach and within walking distance of tons of shopping and hotels. So it's good enough. Would we stay here again? No probably not. I would recommend it to my low maintenance friends who live on a budget, but I would not recommend it to anyone who is even slightly picky and has a little bit more money.","Los Angeles, California","Hoovergab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",108,3.0

We went into it not expecting ""elite"" service, and actually came away feeling that we were well taken care of. And so with eyes wide open, our stay was actually very enjoyable, and we felt the staff really exceeded our expectations.Reservation: I actually was looking at a couple of Aqua properties, but I asked the lady on the phone, and she was able to tell me which hotels were under renovation during my stay. That helped in selecting the right hotel. I even called multiple times in the same day to ask more questions, and she (was the same lady each time) was really friendly and helpful.Location: Really, 5 minutes from the beach. We brought our 8-month old, and it was never a problem walking with her. I asked at the Front Desk for overnight hotel parking (rented a car for 2 days), but there wasn't a space available. There's a few metered parking spots on the street, and I was always able to find parking (you can park for free on Ala Moana near the canal (if you can get a spot) or at the metered spots after 6pm (but you have to move it again before 7am). Same or 1 block distance to the bus/trolley stops. I even walked to The Rainbow Drive-in with no problems. For the price, you're really getting good access to Waikiki.Room: Great view! (we stayed on the top 16th floor) Again, for the price, this couldn't be beat. With the A/C on, I couldn't hear any of the street noise, and we slept soundly. With it off, I could hear the car honks, even someone yelling (but nothing to the point of having to bring ear plugs, like I read other hotels GIVING to their guests to block out the noise). The room was always clean. Now that I think of it, the deadbolt doesn't actually work, but I never felt unsafe. Everything worked, ample plugs throughout the room for my electronics. Bathroom is decent (ours had a basin sink and slate floors).Breakfast: It's 7a-8:30a. Pancakes, oatmeal, a couple of fresh fruit selections, and some type of small baked good (mini-muffins or doughnuts). OJ, milk, coffee, water. The restaurant it's served in has maybe 8-10 tables seating 4 people each, so it's not BIG -- but again, don't expect a banquet and it won't disappoint. Think of a Starbucks-sized vending machine with pancakes. Just enough to wake you up -- we only ate there half the time, to be honest, because we wanted to try other places in Hawaii. But if you're on a budget, you could fill up on what they had to offer and it would tide you over to lunch.Staff: Very friendly. Funny too. Again, go into this expecting to get what you're paying for. You're not paying for someone to carry you to your room via piggyback or rose petals; you're paying for a room to relax in, in between the things you do in Hawaii. I asked for suggestions, and I got them. I joked around with the staff, and we all had a good time. One lady came in almost like she was expecting to be greeted at the threshold of the hotel and waited on hand and foot, as if she was paying for service by the minute. My wife and I came in as if we were renting a room from a college friend, and we always felt welcome. One staff member, Nolan, was really helpful to us; we learned midway in our trip that he was leaving for the Disney place, which was a shame, but he lives closer to Aulani and it was a better opportunity for him. But Vinh and the rest of the staff were just as friendly. OVERALL, just ""hang loose"", don't be uptight, and everything's gonna be alright. :) If you prefer to be pampered by servants instead of helped out by friends, this probably isn't your cup of tea.

Small rooms...well, you are in Hawaii....hello...GO OUTSIDE!!! However, upon reading that I looked and saw I could upgrade to a superior room that offered 340 sq. feet compared to 220 sq. ft. I did that and found the room to be a very nice size (large if you compare to European hotels) with couch, coffee table, dresser, mini fridge, dishware, microwave, small kitchen sink and balcony with 2 chairs. I saved money by being able to save my leftovers and reheat them! I read the staff was unfriendly....WHAT? The review writer must be some nasty person because every member of the staff was helpful, kind and went above and beyond trying to help us. A maintenance staff member even went out on the back roof after I dropped my hair clip (I know...but I got it in Italy) from the 15th floor and retrieved it for me!The managers reception (every Tuesday) was a treat.

But, it is inexpensive and you get what you pay for in Waikiki. It's next to the Canal, which is a pretty view in the daytime. You can barely see the Beach, but it's only a few blocks away. It's near the International Market which has great pineapple non-alchololic drinks. The rooms felt a little small in space, but everything does in Waikiki. The most confusing thing was trying to determine what the room you were ordering online was going to be like (in terms of how many beds and what type of beds). The staff was friendly, but the police department was there everyday for something (which the staff would not tell you what)......Breakfast was simple but free. As always, its right next to an ABC store! The pool was small but good. Parking price was $15 to $20 but at least they had parking.",Wisconsin,"My_kids_Mom6</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wisconsin</strong>",22,3.0

My room was equipped with a microwave and refrigerator and coffee maker and dishes, forks etc. I did not use them because I like to go to restaurant for dinner, but in case you need to eat in the room you can do it. Also an important feature is the safety box.. with no extra charge and the internet in the room with no extra charge.- My room was very big, the bathroom equipped with all you may need.- The breakfast was included in my room rate and it was good (I suggest only to add some proteins like eggs or cheese..)- the swimming pool is small but very nice.- They organize shuttle to and from the airport. I suggest you to take advantage of this because of the convenient rate.- They also have a Spa (I have used it the day after my arrival to relax my mind after a 26 hours trip.... (I suggest you to take advantage of their offer.. If you have a massage before noon if I am not wrong - you have a special price..) The spa is small but clean and confortable. The massage was very good....This is my second time in Honolulu, the first time I have choosen another Aqua Hotel (not anymore Aqua now), that hotel was directly on Waikiki... But If I will return to Honolulu I will surely stay in the Aqua Aloha surf because in my opinion is the best for all the reasons I have listed... I will return there in few days for my last day of vacation.. I will bring with me good memories of this place and the people working in this property....

With that said, the front desk staff is friendly and ready to help you with all your transportation needs and questions. Room has a small fridge to hold your drinks and snacks. It was a $35 ride from the airport to hotel, but we took a shuttle in the am that cost $10 each. It cost $16 each person for the ride over to Pearl Harbor. The hotel is a good location to walk to Waikkiki Beach and you pass several good breakfast places and plenty of ABC stores for all your shopping needs.

She offered an upgrade to superior room for same price as standard room (superior has balcony); she was also excited to hear that I was coming to Honolulu to go on a 'Tiger Cruise' - I was glad to hear that a hotel staff member even knew what a 'Tiger Cruise' was. Upon my arrival, another receptionist (""Aimee"") greeted me pleasantly, as well. My room was on 14th floor, decent size and clean.

This hotel could use some serious renovations. The room very small but was clean and it had a nice television with cable. The bed was clean and pretty comfortable and the bathroom was clean. You can use the internet but they don't have wireless and you have to borrow a cable from the lobby or bring your own. The room was very old and had a lot of holes in the walls (not from fists but from stuff that had one time been hanging). It could use some paint. The floors were carpetted but really old and dingy. The bathroom only had a shower... no bathtub. The windows were really thin so you could hear the street noise. I was on the 15th floor so I was able to still sleep through the noise.The curtains were probably the original and had stains all over. Very dingy. I found the mirror hung on the entire wall behind the bed pretty tacky. I did not use the pool but did walk past it. It was brownish but I think that was from the bottom of the pool and hopefully not just the water. I didn't fully inpsect the situation. The hotel has breakfast which starts at 0700. I didn't try it because I checked out prior to it starting. I think if you book through the hotel, breakfast is included but if you book through another website it is not.

We were told that this was a delivery to a nearby supermarket and that it happened every day. We asked if we could be moved and the hotel management were very good - they put us on a higher floor on the opposite side of the building - that solved the problem nicely.Our main problem was with parking. On our arrival the car park was full and we had to park in a nearby public car park which cost $18 overnight. We had to move the car before 7 am in order to avoid an additional full day's parking fee. We complained to the hotel about the parking and they issued us with a parking permit and assured us that we wouldn't have a problem again - we didn't, for the next two days as we arrived back between 5 and 6 pm. On the next day we returned at 10.30 and there were no spaces so we were next door again, having to move the car by 7 am. We complained again and the staff did what they could to try to resolve the situation. The problem is though that there simply are not enough spaces, even for people with permits. It was explained to us that some people use the car park illegally and that reduces the spaces for guests.

Stayed only 2 nites in Waikiki before moving over to Turtle Bay on the North Shore. The hotel is a located on the canal side of Waikiki and I do have to say, I did miss the direct ocean views. However, our view from Deluxe Room 1402 on the corner of the 14th floor did privide a peek-a-boo ocean view which was a pleasant suprise. The location of the hotel was great, central enough to all that Waikiki has to offer. We didnt spend much time at the hotel other than for sleeping and showering....and the bed was sooo comfy! Just wanted to roll up that mattress and take it home with me! Decent room size (we had a corner room) and never had any problems with water tempature as noted by other guests. One negative is the price for parking! 20$ a day is a bit of a buzzkill.....and its very hard to find street parking in the evening. We decided just to pay for the two days that we were there since we didnt have to worry about paying for parking on the other side of the island. But, parking would have ran us 160$ if we had stayed in Waikiki the length of our vacation and that would have been a major negative with us. Maybe the hotel should consider discounting parking rates depending on the length of your stay? Wandered over to the lil bar and grill accross the way at the Sand Villa.....open late for pupus and cocktails....great prices, decent food. All in all, had a great stay, would definatley stay again if we were in Waikiki.....would definatley suggest this hotel for budget minded travelers or those who like a nice comfy home base who plan on using the amenties of nature to spend the day.....not the infinity pool and tennis courts of thier hotel.

The hotel is clean and comfortable, the staff are friendly and helpful, and the price is very reasonable.The hotel is located on a side street that runs between busy Kuhio Ave and Ala Wai Blvd, so you’re away from the worst of the traffic. That’s not to say you won’t hear sirens or other noises – this is a major city, after all – but if you ask for a room at the back of the hotel rather than facing Kanekapolei St, you should enjoy relative peace and quiet. Rooms can be very small. The most basic, the moderate, is tiny and has no balcony. Not a problem if you’re staying just a night or two and plan to use the room only for sleeping and showering, but if you’re staying longer, you’ll be more comfortable in something larger. We had a deluxe with balcony, which is considerably more spacious and includes a sofa as well as dishes and cutlery.This was our second stay at the Aqua Aloha in two years. The beds have been replaced since our last visit and are really comfortable. Breakfasts are pretty much as before – basics like pancakes, oatmeal, toast and sliced fruit, which you may want to augment with yogurt, milk and real fruit juice from the ABC Store down the street – but they may no longer be included in the room rate. Breakfast was part of our vacation package and is, I believe, included if you book directly with the hotel, but if you go through a third party, you may have to pay. Another minor change is that you now need cards, issued at check-in, to get beach towels from the front desk. Internet access is available throughout the hotel – wireless in the lobby, via Ethernet cable in your room, though we were actually able to get wireless connection there too. The in-room safe is big enough for a laptop. The hotel is a two-minute walk to the beach. If you’re a jogger, the sidewalk along Ala Wai Canal, right beside the hotel, is a popular spot. There’s a city-owned 18-hole golf course on the other side of the canal and public tennis courts an easy walk away at Kapiolani Park and Diamond Head Tennis Centre. The zoo and aquarium are also within easy walking distance. TheBus, O’ahu’s great public transit system, will get you to many other places of interest without the hassle of renting and parking a car. The nearest stop, which serves many routes, is just a moment from the hotel. This time we rode TheBus to Hanauma Bay, Hawaii’s Plantation Village, the Lyon Arboretum, Manoa Falls and the Honolulu Academy of Arts. On our previous visit TheBus took us on a circle tour around the island, to Senator Fong’s Plantation and Garden, Makapuu Point and Lighthouse, Pearl Harbour, the Bishop Museum and Kailua Bay, among other destinations.The Aqua chain has a number of hotels in Waikiki. I haven’t stayed in any others so can’t comment on their facilities or service, but we walked past several and on that basis I’d say the Aloha Surf and Spa wins hands down for the quietest location (least road traffic) and biggest lobby (nice setting for weekly manager’s cocktail party). Definitely recommended, provided you're looking for comfort rather than luxury.","Victoria, BC","Tripsterchick</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, BC</strong>",393,5.0

The hotel is handy for Waikiki beach, being only a five minute walk, but located by the Ala Wai canal which means it is a little quieter than some hotels on the main road.The staff are very friendly, the breakfast is basic but welcome, the hotel is very clean, the pool is small but nice if you can get in early and reserve a space and some of the views from the higher floors are great. Also has free internet, which is not always a given in some larger, chain hotels.We booked through priceline so got a really good deal but would recommend this hotel to anyone.We heard that the canal could be dangerous at night but saw no evidence of this being true. The canal is in fact quite a nice walk during the day time, particularly if you're going to Bailey's for some vintage Hawaiian shirts.One problem - when you get the bus from the airport, the Aloha Surf can be quite far down the drop-off order. It is literally a one minute walk from the regular bus stop though, so do consider saving a bit of money and just taking the scheduled bus rather than the airport express.There is also a one way system in operation on some streets for those who are driving.","Houston, Texas","sandersandrew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",24,4.0

It is a small, boutique hotel with clean rooms, good service, great personnel, and an outstanding value for the price we paid. We took a deluxe room with a large king-size bed, a couch, a small refrigerator, coffee-maker, and a microwave oven, which is a rarity in almost all other hotels. The microwave was extremely useful in heating muffins, biscuits, and leftover food that we brought back from restaurants (we stayed for a week). The room had plates, bowls, coffee cups, and silverware too. It was nice to sit on the balcony with our morning coffee, watching the sun come up. True, we could not see the beach from the hotel, but we could look the other way and have a magnificent view of the Koolau Mountains, Palolo Valley, the Kaimuki district, and Manoa Valley (home of the University of Hawaii). We could also see early morning canoe paddlers and kayakers in the Ala Wai Canal, as well as golfers across the canal, and walkers and joggers along the canal.The hotel also provided free coffee or hot tea in the lobby in addition to a free copy of the daily, local newspaper. On Tuesday afternoons, there is a Manager's Reception during which there was musical entertainment, free massages, chocolate-covered macadamia nut candies, and the hotel's signature drink called a Wipeout. According to Manager/""Bartender"", Tim Clark, the drink consisted of vodka, blue curacao, pineapple juice, and coconut cream. Yes, they were delicious, and you could have all you wanted!The location of the hotel is very nice too. It is a short two-block walk to the beach and what would be considered the Heart of Waikiki. Walk straight down Kanekapolei Street and you'll come right to Kalakaua Avenue (the main artery of Waikiki) and the Moana Surfrider Hotel, which was the first hotel ever built in Waikiki. The beach is just to the left of the hotel. Walk to the right along the avenue, and you will come to all the shops and restaurants you could possibly want in Waikiki. By the way, around the corner on Kuhio Avenue (and a short two-minute walk from the hotel) is the Food Pantry. It is the ONLY full-service supermarket in Waikiki. We picked up all our snacks and ""goodies"" from this market. And, in case you don't have a rental car, the excellent city bus service runs on both Kuhio and Kalakaua Avenues.My wife and I live most of the year in Maine. We were in Honolulu to celebrate our birthdays, and staying in a nice, clean hotel certainly helped to make our vacation a great one! I don't know what else to say except that if you want the most ""bang for your buck"" and have a clean, inexpensive hotel with a friendly staff to help you ENJOY your Waikiki stay, then this hotel is the place for you!","Brunswick, Maine","RDOBrien</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brunswick, Maine</strong>",1,4.0

As many others have mentioned, the location is great; it's two blocks from the beach and close to a Food Pantry (shares the same parking lot) and the bus stop. As a disclaimer, this hotel is definitely not ""honey-moon"" material, but if you are like us and not planning on spending a whole lot of time in the room anyway the Aqua Aloha is a great value. In addtion to the great location & value, we really enjoyed the friendly front desk folks and the Tuesday night free Wipeout drinks and reception. The rooms have a mini fridge and microwave which was a nice bonus for us as we purchased groceries for our breakfast and lunches. There was a small pool, we went to it once or twice and enjoyed it.The room was definitely small and a bit outdated, and unfortunately we did get a room on the street side of the hotel... I was so excited to get to the room I totally forgot to ask for one on the Lagoon side at check-in. We planned on asking to move but once all of our stuff was unpacked and had spent a night we thought we could handle the road noise (we're both heavy sleepers). I would say our biggest complaint was probably the shower... I imagine it was not just our room, but it would just not hold a constant temperature. It would literally go from normal to scalding then straight to freezing within a few seconds multiple times during a 10-15 minute shower! I literally am not exaggerating, this definitely needs to be fixed.I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family... as long as you go with the right attitude, you cannot go wrong with the location and value.","Bellingham, Washington","mattster03</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bellingham, Washington</strong>",31,4.0

We had problems setting up our laptop and upon requesting assistance from the front desk, a gentleman arrived at our room and within a few minutes he had diagnosed and fixed our problem. There is free internet here so bring your laptops. Frontend employees were professional, courteous and helpful. This hotel has an authentic ""Hawaii"" feel to it, with glass slats for windows that open to allow warm tradewinds to flow through your room. There is a huge acquarium filled with tropical fish located in the breakfast room. A large glass cistern filled with ice and water is available in the open lobby and welcomes thirsty patrons returning from their outings at the beach and city. The lobby has an inviting decor that beckons one to sit and enjoy the cool breeze that flows through the entire lower level. A stack of daily newspapers are free to patrons and I found this to be the added touch that made me feel like it was home. Beach towels were also available for visits to the beach. Our plane leaves at eight oclock this evening and the front desk said that we could store our luggage in their luggage room until it is convenient to pick it up.There is no reason to stay anywhere else in Waikiki unless you are in to the Los Angelos hotel style, but then why are you in Hawaii anyways?

This was the best holiday we've had in years, but of course it's Hawaii! Even the tsunami scare the last night we were there, was handled very calmly and professionally by the staff and we felt unafraid....just paid attention to the information coming to us.

The hotel is reasonably priced, in a convenient location, and the rooms and service were satisfactory. Also, the free continental breakfast was an added bonus.However, during our stay March 16 - 22, we had a much smaller room that faced the street and was extremely noisy. We were also unaware that the free continental breakfast was no longer being provided to guests who do not book their rooms directly with the hotel. When I was informed about this by the front desk person, she stated I could speak to the manager.The manager, Tim Clark was arrogant, smug and was not the least bit interested in guest relations. He stated it was Travelocity's responsbility to notify us and that the change occurred in August 2010. He advised us to book directly with the hotel instead of with Travelocity if we want the breakfast included. He also commented that we got a very good deal on our package and what were we complaining about. Obviously, he is uninterested in ensuring guests return to his property. We definitely will not return to this hotel since there are so many other options available in Waikiki.","Chula Vista, California","GeorgeD9654</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chula Vista, California</strong>",2,2.0

I booked the hotel after reading lots of reviews and forum posts here on TA, and overall was attracted to the price, location, and relatively good reviews. This is definitely a hotel for budget-conscious travelers who want a clean, safe and comfortable place to stay, but aren't adamant about having a vast array of amenities and services, or really updated luxuries. My husband and I are really active travelers who spend every moment of the day out and doing things - so we really just needed a place to crash at night and get some good sleep to energize ourselves for the next day's adventures. This hotel served that purpose. We checked into the hotel at around 5 pm on a Tuesday, which meant we walked right into the manager's weekly happy hour - a nice touch. Free cocktails, live music and socializing. The lobby is modern and chic, with friendly and efficient staff. There is exercise equipment around and a very small pool (we never used either). We did sit in the lobby for a few minutes one day to use the free wi-fi. When I booked the room, my reservation had included complimentary breakfast each day but upon check-in I noticed that we'd be charged $4.95 per day per person for breakfast. We decided not to have breakfast at the hotel if we had to pay for it, but in my experience $4.95 isn't too bad for breakfast in the Waikiki area, so maybe others would prefer to go for it. We're not huge breakfast people.I had booked a standard city-view room, and had seen photos here on TA and didn't expect much space. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of room we had. A 6 drawer dresser, 2 night stands, a flat screen TV. Queen sized bed, a keyed safe. The most dated part of the room was the bathroom/shower stall, which is cramped and if you're over 5'8"" you may find that it isn't much room - fortunately we're both pretty short, so it wasn't a problem for us. But on the whole, the room was clean and appointed with everything we needed. It wasn't pindrop quiet at night - in fact, I could here drunk partiers outside coming home each night/early morning around 3 am to nearby hotels, singing loudly and carrying on - but whatever. Waikiki is kind of a vacation party zone, so I imagine that goes with the territory. I had read about the noise and brought foam earplugs with me, but in the end I didn't really care about the noise and never used them. The hotel is located an EASY 3-block walk to Waikiki Beach and all the tourist areas. On your way you'll pass at least 3 ABC stores, a Burger King, a Subway, tons of other local restaurants and cafes and tourist shops, etc. There is every chain restaurant, fast food joint, etc. that you might care to visit, not to mention other local places. And tons of shopping - I had no idea what a shopping mecca Waikiki is. If you enjoy walking and don't mind the few blocks or not waking up to an ocean view, you can save yourself some money by staying here and taking in sights as you stroll to the beach, to lunch/dinner or other activities.One of the big concerns in the Waikiki area is parking. The Aqua Aloha has limited underground parking for an additional $20 a day, and I'd heard that the Aston Waikiki Banyan about 3 blocks away will let you park for $10 a day - but to our delight we were able to find street parking on Ala Wai Blvd. everyday except once for free, within 3-4 blocks of the hotel. We never had to circle more than twice, and you can park there anytime except Fridays 8:30-11:30 am for street cleaning (we were out anyway, so no problem). That being said, we live in a huge East Coast mainland city where we parallel park on the street every single day of our lives, and negotiating the street cleaning days, etc., so this was no biggie to us. If you're used to having garage parking at your home and hate jostling for street parking, maybe you should spring for the garage pass. But I was happy that we saved a few bucks doing this - and it was easy.The Aqua Aloha also has coin-operated washers and dryers in the basement/parking level, which we used - nice to be able to wash a load and pack light for your trip. The front desk provided me quarters for change, which was easy enough.If you're a runner, you'll be happy to know that the Aqua Aloha is located conveniently to several pleasant running routes, including a paved path around the Ala Wai Canal, and then routes that take you along the Queen's Park and then to Waikiki Beach and Diamondhead. You'll really like it. Overall, I'd definitely stay here again. At $119 a night and no extra for parking, we saved a ton of money that we could use to do other fun activities and eat some awesome meals out.","Miami Lakes, Florida","nolaJP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami Lakes, Florida</strong>",30,3.0

We were not disappointed. The staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel is a short walk to the beach. The ""budget"" room where we stayed was very basic but we didn't find it uncomfortable (like some other reviews seemed to indicate and....there's a difference between ""needs upgrading"" and dirty. The Aloha Surf is not dirty). After all, we were there to enjoy Waikiki, not stay in our room. The managers reception on Tuesday night was fun with free drinks, music and massages. The continental breakfast was a big plus (wasn't nearly as sparse and some reviews indicate). The wireless internet in the lobby worked well as did the wired internet in the room (I suggest bringing your own 15 foot network cord). If you want a little more space in the room, I would suggest upgrading to one of the upper floors (we peeked). So, if you want to spend a lot of money and be pampered and stumble out of bed to buy $12 Mai-Tai's at the beach bar, please book at one of the ""foo-foo"" hotels.

I've been reading some of the previous negative reviews and I think they are uncalled for. The hotel staff is friendly, welcoming, and quick to resolve any issues. When we first got to our room, we could not get the AC to start. So we called the front desk, and in less than 5 minutes, the maintenance guy showed up and fixed the AC. YES, the rooms are tiny. But what do you expect? This is Waikiki, my darlings. Space is limited as it is, and I certainly do not blame the hotel for tiny rooms. If you are looking for large luxurious spaces, pick a more expensive hotel! We had no problems with the size of the room. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and everything was clean. YES, it is noisy. MOST hotels located smack in the middle of the city are going to be noisy. Again, it's common sense. We were not bothered by the noise, in fact, it helped us to wake up earlier so we could get out and experience the things Hawaii has to offer. If you want a quieter hotel, pick one that's far from the city, or pick a higher floor. What we loved most was how amazingly good the housekeeping staff was. Rosalie did a wonderful job of keeping the room clean for us and making sure we were always stocked with necessities. In fact, one morning we overslept and did not leave the hotel until around noon, and when we returned that night the room had been cleaned! We had thought for sure that housekeeping would skip us since we ran so late, and were expecting to return to a messy room. But she must have returned to clean up well after finishing her rounds. The effort was definitely appreciated :) YES, the bathroom is a little older than other newer hotels, but so what?? It's kept clean, well stocked, there's hot water when you need it, and a shower stall. It's COZY, not run-down or falling apart. If you are looking to spend your vacation locked up in the hotel room and staring at a pretty bathroom with a bathtub, don't bother going to Hawaii in the first place! ;) Our room was equipped with a mini refrigerator and a microwave, and also a coffeemaker. We were also given a cord for internet access, which worked fine with us. We only had to use our laptop a couple of times to check on certain things.

We were first given a tiny room with a really loud noise coming from an exhaust fan outside. We were moved to a more normal sized room, but the noise from outside was still incredibly loud. It felt like we were still on the plane, but it was after midnight and we were exhausted so I slept with earplugs. (Later we discovered one source of noise was large refrigeration fans at the Food Pantry which is right behind the hotel.) The problem is that the windows are louvered glass and can't keep out very much noise. The next day the clerk told us there was nothing else available, but then gave us a key to a room on the 8th floor with a sliding door that was somewhat quieter, but we could hear the elevator clanking up from below and stopping with a thud right behind the bed.This is Waikiki so of course we didn't expect total peace and quiet and our only other experience was at the Princess Kaiulani which was silent in comparison, but it's not very restful to have to turn on the TV just to drown out noise from the street. In response to the previous reviewer, we were in the back of the 3rd floor so I don't think it would have made a difference for you to move.We booked this hotel based the on the startlingly positive reviews here and the fact that it was only $100 a night during Christmas week compared to $200 at the Kaiulani. The location was good, but everything else was average including the staff, some of whom seemed inconvenienced by any disturbance. Maybe this is the best you can get in Waikiki at this price, but next time we won't mind paying a little more.Note: We had a completely different experience at another Aqua hotel on Kaua'i.","Vancouver, Canada","MCJuicy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",7,2.0

I mentioned this to the front desk and was told they will fixed it. After two days I figured this is a plumbing problem so if you have this room be prepared.Hope this helps you.

The four of us found the hotel very clean and an excellent location (far enough from the hussle and bussle of the beach and main drag, but yet plenty close to the hussle and bussle that it took only a few minutes to be on the main street and shopping, etc.) We couldn't imagine trying to get any sleep in any hotels closer to the beach. The front desk staff were very friendly and kind. No question was left unanswered; if they didn't know the answer, they would find it for you. We demagnetized our room keys many times and they reissued them with a smile every time. The towel system was great and there were always towels available when you were ready for a fresh one.When we arrived we had only booked one room, then decided to get a second room and were lucky enough to have rooms next door to each other. The rooms were quiet. Other than hearing a room door close, we never heard noise in the hall or from other rooms. The rooms were quite comfortable and cute and very clean. The fridge/microwave/dishes and kitchen sink were very handy to have and use.The continental breakfast was great - complete with fresh fruit, muffins, coffee/tea and even freshly made pancakes!The manager held happy hour one evening while we were there, complete with an interesting blue drink, music, massage chairs to try out and a sketch artist. What a nice touch! Made the hotel feel like a home away from home.We had parking for our rental car underground and the fee was very reasonable.The pool was a good size to cool off/relax in at the end of a busy day.There wasn't any Wifi in the rooms, but we were given a cable to use for internet hook-up, so that was just as easy.On our checkout day we were able to leave our luggage with the front desk for pick up later in the day - a service travellers really appreciate.Anyone looking for a reasonably priced vacation would certainly enjoy this hotel. This vacation was our 25th wedding anniversary and we were thrilled our daughter found us such a great hotel.","Peterborough, Canada","NorthofToronto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peterborough, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

The problem was resolved the next morning and once again everyone on staff was very professional and polite. The room was at the top of the hotel on the street side, which made it somewhat noisy - especially when some of the delivery trucks came by early in the morning!

There was a roomy bathroom, with a standard modern shower stall. A few things could have been fixed up a bit, like one of the window cranks and the sliding door curtain-lining which was torn. Overall a comfortable relaxing room.In the morning there is a free Continental style breakfast with fresh-made pancakes, toast, muffins, cake, oatmeal porridge, fresh fruit and a variety of beverages. There is a free coffee machine that brews good, fresh, individual cups in the lobby next to the breakfast room, all day.We attended the Manager's Reception on the Tuesday and had a lovely time drinking a few ""Wipe Outs"" that were expertly mixed by Tim the hotel manager. We spoke a little and I mentioned that we were visiting in part to celebrate my wife's birthday the next day. Imagine our surprise when the next day in the lobby Tim came by and presented my wife with a very nice box of local chocolates ( her favorites) and wished her a very Happy Birthday! We were impressed that he could remember something like that after meeting and speaking with so many other guests the night before!

The value for the hotel/location is excellent and service was outstanding and the room was clean.They have a small gym (located in kind of of a weird place), they have 3 pieces of exercise equipment available to use from 5am on.

The a/c worked fine, however it is located by the base of the floor on the opposite end of the room from the bed. We all know that hot air rises, so the fact that the cold air starts off at the bottom of the floor really does not help cool down the room and even though the air was blowing cold from the a/c unit, it did not have a lot of fan speed behind it so the room really never got that cool. I had it blowing at 60 degrees, but it was still a bit warmer than I normally liked. My room was facing the street so there was a certain amount of street noise that could not be avoided late at night, so if you want a room that is quieter, you may want to request a room facing away from the street.They also serve a very nice continental breakfast, pancakes, oatmeal, small muffins, slices of fruit, toast.

Even though I was going on a budget trip I had an amazing time. I wanted to stay under a $1000.00 for air/hotel. So these comments are just my opinion. I have done some travelling so I know what I like and dont like.Hotel was basic but clean and the staff where very friendly.Room-well, what can I say it was very small with two single beds (not doubles). I bit dated, bathroom was small and only had a shower. The windows in the room had those panel so it was very noisy. My room had a fridge and we also had internet connect but had to use cable. We made a comment to the hotel manager and they offered to upgrade us to a bigger room but we decided to stay in same room since we did not spend alot of time there.Hotel Location-was about 2 blocks from beach so I was fine with this. Parking-they do have parking but it was 20.00/day (bit expensive) and one night there where no parking for us.Breakfast-I am bit fussy here so we only ate the first morning and that was the apples/oranges and the toast. Very basic. There is a restaurant 1 block down on the corner with breakfast for 3.95 (2 pancakes, bacon and eggs). I also purchased some fruit from the ABC stores and had the spinach egg wrap from Starbucks. There are many options.Beach - was pretty nice. The water was cold but on those hot days it was refreshing. We had nice weather during our trip. The beach was busy at times but we where ok with this. We where going to rent some umbrellas at the beach but found out our hotel offered those cheap ones and they worked just fine. They also offered boogie boards and the matts. You can buy the matts for $1.99 at the ABC stores.Restaurants-lots around but our favorite is the cheesecake factory. We had this salad that was big enough for 3 people. Drinks are expensive. 8.95 for tropical ones. Duke's another favorite-right on beach and live music. Starbucks is one block up and 2 blocks over. We went to Honolulu to this restaurant called Aloha Tower-very nice, had live music. We also went to Jameson's by the Sea in Haleiwa (north shore).Car Rental-we rented an convertible for 2 days. We went to the North Shore (Waimea Bay) and to a luau at Paraside cove (booked thu hotel) for $125.0 for deluxe package which includes seating at front, meal is served, 4 drinks, picture and a mug. I didnt drink since I drove there. You can take tour bus.If you are driving anywhere, leave before 4:00 or after 6:00 since the highway is very busy.North Shore beaches where amazing and quite - we went on the monday so not as busy. Also, if you see the red flags up beware. People are in the ocean but that is the locals and they know the water. The power of the ocean took us by surprise!!We went to Pearl Harbour-very interesting-you cannot take your back packs in so leave in car. you can take camera.So overall I had an amazing time. We would stay at this hotel again-yes. I would get a different room. There is alot to see in Waikiki but drive around the island. It is amazing!!!","Calgary, AB","Themis380</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, AB</strong>",0,3.0

We found all the staff to be helpful and friendly.We upgraded to a superior city view room that was perfect for the two of us. For us, it would not have been as enjoyable with any more than 2 adults. The full wall of windows with the sliding glass door onto the lanai made the room feel light and airy and we enjoyed sitting on the couch looking out. We appreciated the many amenities. The in-room safe allowed us to be carefree when we went to the beach for our surf lesson knowing that our valuables were locked up. The mini-kitchenette with plates and silverware allowed us to ""eat-in"" 4 very simple suppers and pack lunches. It was great to have the Food Pantry right next door. I was pleased to find cooked oatmeal, bread for toast, pancakes cooked on a griddle, and orange wedges on the free breakfast line rather than just sweets.

It was a tremendous value and we're quite happy overall with our stay.The hits:- awesome location- clean rooms- friendly staff- really comfy beds- wicked powerful A/C in the rooms!- Ethernet cable for in-room internet provided at no cost- free beach towel and beach mat lending service- we always found parking (and always underground for 7 of our 8 days!) in the hotel lotThe misses:- Aqua's website is misleading in terms of internet accessibility...wifi is only in the lobby; rooms only have a wired access port. I'm not saying that they should spend the money to put wifi in every room, but clarifying the website would alleviate guest disappointment - just let us know in advance that there's only wired internet up in the room, that's all.- the 'continental breakfast' really wasn't up to snuff (unless you're into eating nothing but sugar for breakfast). Pancakes, cakey muffins, toast (only butter - no other condiments), some sad looking apple slices, powdered donuts, and chocolate cake (seriously!) were on hand, but that was it. That being said, cheap Hawaiian breakfast can be had in pretty much any direction within a block's walk for the $3.75/person range, so it's really not that bad.- this is a little picky, but a higher grade of toilet paper would sure be nice...it's not like gas station toilet paper or anything, but definitely the cheapest stuff I've ever seen in a hotel. But that's easily fixed by picking up your own if it bothers you.Overall we're really happy with our stay here, and would go out of our way to stay here again - and would definitely recommend it to others.

Let's start with the highlights: Location is good. Right near the canal and four longer blocks from the beach. Enjoy being away from the madness of the beach hotels. The lobby is bright and airy with a large TV. Nice place to seat to plan your day or wait for a tour bus. Also received a good rate.The rooms themselves are average. Decent size with a nice touch of mini fridge, sink, microwave and plates & utensils in your room. I was on a higher floor and had a nice view of the city. Didn't find this hotel any noiser than any other hotel in a big city. The shower was great, but no bathtub if you want that. Sink and vanity are outside of the shower/toilet room. Small, but enough space for my toileties. Didn't have to wait long for either of the two elevators. Free papers each morning in the lobby.Now for the downside: The furniture is dated. My sofa had stains all over it. The lighting in the room is almost non-existant. If you want to sit anywhere but the bed at night, you won' t see much. The room also had a strange smell to it. My balcony was covered with water leaking from my airconditioner and bird feces. Didn't use it during my stay.They offer Wifi in the lobby. If you don't have a computer, they have (a self named)""world's greatest internet cafe"" in the lobby. It was only open once during my week and then the employee told me that the internet was not available.The hotel offers a complimentary breakfast. It is sparse. For someone who is looking for healthy options, they do have fresh fruit, which is nice. The breakfast is from 7-830 daily, so if you arent up early, you will miss out. They state they have a fitness center. It looks to be two machines off the lobby. The week I was there, both had big bags over them saying out of order. Asking the front desk for other alternatives, he told me he knew of none.This brings me to the bigger issue I have with the hotel: The staff. With the exception of the hotel's manager (who could have not been nicer) and the woman who works overnights at the front desk, I was surprised at the demeanor and service the front desk offered. From the man who checked me in to the afternoon and evening staff. No one ever had a smile or friendly greeting. This is Hawaii, so as someone who travels there often, I really expect more. At this hotel, I felt that I shouldn't. You really felt like you could have been at any big chain location along any highway in the country.Though I love the location and this hotel has much potential, because of the lackluster staff, I would definitely have to think hard before returning.","New York, NY","W731KBdavidw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",120,3.0

This hotel so much better compared to the other Aqua resort we stayed at last year. Everyone at front reception/desk staff was extremely helpful pleasant and professional. I dealt with a lot of the staff at the front desk because of internet problems (my computer was not configured properly and I had to try and sort this out with my IT department back at home). One staff member (unfortunately, we didn't get his name) was very helpful providing directions and making suggestions for how to spend the day - even to say advise us ""Ladies - medium rare"" for amount of sun exposure we should get.The room was a bit dated but that was OK because we weren't spending our vacation in the room. The beds were very comfortable (new pillow top mattresses) and they gave us clean towels every day. Note, at this Aqua hotel, they provided towels for the beach. Last year, we had to take bath towels to the beach. The breakfast though predictable was better than other hotels where breakfast is included in the price - pancakes, oatmeal and fresh fruit.The hotel was closed to public transportation, shopping and within a short walking distance to the beach.I would recommend this hotel.

We were overall quite happy with it. I won't fault them for the garbage trucks in the morning--not their fault.I will mention a couple points that could be improved, both of which have already been mentioned. First, the breakfast is just sweet carbs. Pancakes, muffins, and actual chocolate cake for breakfast. There was oatmeal and some cut fruit, true, but the breakfast really needs something else...I like the previous commenter's suggestion of hard boiled eggs. Or at least milk to go with the starches. The fake juice was a bad drink to start the day with. Second, they really need to be clearer about returning the parking passes. Exactly like the previous person, we had no idea we were supposed to return it, so when we checked out, they tried to charge us for parking for all days. We convinced them we'd only used it one day, so they corrected it, thank goodness. If they weren't as accommodating, this would have been a huge bummer.So I spent more time on the two improvement areas than the rest, but really, the rest of it was all pretty good. Note: I didn't use the spa, so I can't comment on that. I'd have no qualms about staying here again or recommending it.

All were helpful with towels for the beach, directions to local hot spots and made check-in and check-out painless. Even though our room was a bit snug it came with everything we needed to enjoy our trip at it's fullest. Besides, we were hardly in our room except to crash at night after a full day of trips around the island. We would certainly look at returning to the Aloha Surf in the future and most definitely recommend it to our friends.","Tacoma, Washington","CWBru1982</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tacoma, Washington</strong>",0,4.0

And it's three long blocks from the beach. But you're also not paying $300 a night. This hotel goes the extra mile, something not so common these days for a 2-3 star hotel. Front desk staff - and room service, for that matter - are cheerful and helpful. Rooms are a tad dated, but in excellent condition and kept spotless. Never ran out of hot water. A stack of newspapers are at the lobby elevators. Towels are terrific and there's a never-ending supply of them at the front desk if you want to take them to the beach or use around the pool. The pool is too small and the loungers seem always to be inhabited by the same people who missed the kindergarten lesson about sharing — but the most famous beach in the world is three blocks away so why stay at the pool? A couple small gripes: the included breakfast is too sweet and desperately in need of some protein — perhaps a hard-boiled egg would be a cost effective way of responding to this. Also, parking is available if you book a day or two ahead — but make sure that when you return the car to the rental agency that you let the front desk know that you don't need parking anymore, or else they assume you still want it and charge you at the end of your stay (actually, when we explained ourselves, they took it off the bill, but you may not look so honest or pitiable). This chain is the only Hawaiian-owned chain, so the money stays in the local economy. Next time, we'll stay at an Aqua Hotel again, but perhaps a different one just for the change. Oh, and make sure you ask for a balcony if you want one.","Vancouver, Canada","GastownWanderer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",65,4.0

It was quiet, clean (enough) and within walking distance to everything. Comfortable was what we wanted and that was what we got, I suppose. The cleaning was a bit uneven though. The first few days it was perfect and then it wasn't. The shower had obviously been overlooked and the dishes were poorly cleaned. We assumed it couldn't possibly have been the little sunshine of a cleaning lady whom we met the first days since she always left the place spotless. It does feel petty to complain about two or three (four?) days of not so great cleaning when everything else was super, but there it is.In conclusion I suppose the only thing I didn't like about the hotel was that I couldn't take Nolan home with me. How can anyone be in such a good mood as early as 7 am? In all the staff was very helpful; Lance for instance was complete and utter awesomeness for printing our boarding passes and fixing our hotel key in the middle of the night.

This is our second stay at the hotel because we like the location and staff there. This hotel is located on the canal side of Waikiki, which means that it's less noisy and busy than being on the main street. The amenities are nice....breakfast, newspapers and Wi-Fi in the lower lobby. Our room was very basic....a view of the condominium complex next door, but it was fine because we didn't spend much time in the hotel. An air conditioner is a necessity on Waikiki; ours kept tripping the circuit breaker but we were able to get it going by resetting it. My only complaint is the $20 per day to park your rental car. We did not know of this fee and were informed by their staff that ""all the hotels charge a fee"" to park on their premises. This may be true but $20 seems exorbitant and this fee is not clearly stated on their web site. Unless you want to hunt around for street parking this is the only sensible alternative....expensive though it may be. If you plan to park in their underground garage, keep your vehicle small....it can get tough maneuvering in those tight spaces. All in all.....this is a very nice hotel in an ideal part of Waikiki.

The room was large and very clean and the location was great.

When I checked in they upgraded our room which was a nice surprise. I booked through the hotel website this summer to take advantage of their promotion at the time, of having every 5th night free. The room was a nice size, it looked like their pictures. There was a couch, coffee table, large bed (which I will add was extremly comfortable). There was a small kitchen area with a fridge and microwave, the bathroom was on the small side, a very small shower, but the water was hot and the pressure was great. the continental breakfast was great....pancakes, oatmeal, toast, and various store bought pastries. There was always fresh fruit, tea/coffee and iced tea. I will say though, after a few days, you get tired of it, would be nice to have some variety. I wont complain though, as its rare to find a hotel that has a complimentary breakfast. There was also free wifi, which is a great find as well. I didn't find the rooms noisy at all. I stayed on the side that faced the apartments, that may of been why. There is likely no nice view at this hotel, unless you're on the top 2 floors. But that wasn't important to me.The rooms appeared very clean, I saw no bugs at all through my stay, and the housekeeping is extremely friendly. However, on our 8th night, we misplaced our safe key. On the hunt for the key, we looked under the kitchenette, surprised to see a broken beer bottle (not from me), and under the bed was the back of a panty liner (not mine). The desk staff were nice, but a little blunt at times. They were very qick to mention charges when I requested things (parking, replacing the safe key, printing off an itenerary, local phone calls, etc.) . Parking is $20 a day, and I was upset to learn that to replace the safe key was a whopping $50. The managers cocktail hous on tuesdays was great, the ""wipeout"" is delicious, the massages are great. I never visited the pool, it was quite small. And surprised there was no nice restaurant or souvenier shop.

The lady at the counter said that it wasn't on a high level, but there was a room on Level 7 we could have. Anything was perfect at that time of the day when all we wanted to do was crash out.We booked a Superior room, with balcony...which faced apartment blocks. The room itself was quite pretty and spacious - with a couch and plenty of room to dump all of our shopping bags & large suitcases.We arrived in on a Tuesday, in time for the Managements Welcome cocktail party, which was really nice. The wipeout cocktails were really yummy, and it was a good opportunity to relax and talk to fellow people staying at the hotel. We only went to the 'free breakfast' twice during the 12 days, as we're not massive fans of the things that were available for the breakfast - toast (but the only condiment being cream cheese), pancakes, and then pineapple pieces, mini muffins & mini donuts. The coffee was good though. This free breakfast is only available between 7am and 8.30am.The thing I'd like to say about this hotel is don't expect it to be a 5 star hotel at a lower starred price. We paid $79 US a night (before taxes) which is an amazing price when other hotels in the same region are charging $200 US + a night. The bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, the fridge kept things cold - can you see the pattern here? Our room facing the apartment blocks / street was quite noisy - my husband is a light sleeper and could only sleep for 3-4 hours a night due to the noises of a nighttime, then at 6am onwards with trucks, cleaners on the same level shouting to one another and over their walkie talkie etc. If you're a light sleeper, maybe ask for a room on a higher level or facing away from the street.If I was to go back to Hawaii again, I probably would stay here again - just with those pre-requisites in place for our room - higher up, and away from the noisy street. But it was a great rate for a nice hotel! Thanks for the stay.","Launceston, Australia","riley84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Launceston, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

It was way beyond my expectation and that's why i am writting this review for you guys. Just remember this is not a 5-star hotel then you will enjoy your stay! - I stayed for 8 nights and I got more than what I paid for! This hotel is just 2 blocks (about 5mins) away from the waikiki beach, BUT the Ala Wai canal is right beside you and you can enjoy the ""park view"" instead.Parking is available (USD 20 per day - just like most of waikiki hotels)Be aware! All the luxury brands shops such as Tiffany & Co., Louis Vuitton, Chanel are on the Kalakaua Ave. which is just one block away from the hotel.

When we asked the hotel staff for help they were very accomodating. One of the staffers (I forgot his name but he was very nice!), climbed on top of the roof and got my friend her bathing suit with absolutely no fuss. The contintental breakfast was also more than i expected. I was expecting just a tray of pastries and juice, which is what other hotels offer when they say they serve continental breakfast. However, this hotel served fresh pancakesm juice, fruit, toast, coffee, and some other little snacks. Having one less meal to pay for during a trip makes a big difference!I've stayed at multiple hotels in Waikiki but the location of this hotel is my favorite. Being located in the back of Waikiki your far away from the street noise of the city. I've stayed at hotels in Waikiki where I've had trouble sleeping due to the noise from the street (One time there was a street performer playing steel drums till one in the morning!).

The lobby of the hotel is very nice with a lot of Hawaii charm and nice staff. Check out the manager hour for free drinks, massages, and music on Tuesday at 5PM. They even gave my son some coconut and pineapple juice. We paid extra for a upgraded room and it was still a little cozy but had a balcony. The room had a nice kitchen for basic preparation for snacks and a balcony. The view was of a apartment complex across the street but had some nice mountain views to the east. The room was a little but worn but overall it was comfortable with amenities. There was also a small pool with cold water which was nice for a dip on hot days but not really a place to hang out.

I booked more than 30 days in advance so I saved a nice chunk of change on the room. Im a big guy at 6'11"" so the most important thing to me was having a king bed. I called to book a superior room with a king but was told there were no kings available at that time. So I just booked the next room up a deluxe with a king. A few days later I decided on upgrading to a junior suite and emailed them about it. I was told it was no problem. If I recall the junior suite was $135 more for the 7 nights I would be staying there. Mahina handled all my emails and was great. A few days later I emailed her asking if it was possible to be on the top floor (Honolulu can get loud at night) and she said she'd put in a request for it. Then I asked to have the room facing Diamond Head if at all possible. (The other side of the hotel doesnt have as nice a view as the Diamond Head side btw) She responded that she'd also put that in the request as well. I arrived arould 1pm on June 24th, two hours early for check-in. They held my bags for me at the front counter as the room wasnt ready yet and I spent the next two hours wandering around Waikiki and grabbed lunch. Came back at 3pm, and what do yuou know.....my room was on the top floor (room #1608) and facing diamond head! Couldnt have asked for anything more than that. I never had any issues with noise from outside or from the other rooms. Its definately worth it for the top floor. The bed was brand new (manufacture date on the tag was 6/15/2010!) and was very comfortable.  Yes some of the furniture in the room shows signs of wear, but then again you arent paying $300 a night at the Hilton Hawaiian Village or $450+ at the Moana Surfrider. The balcony was HUGE! compared to the other size rooms that werea floor below us. It also didnt have the white plastic furniture outside that the units that are below a junior suite have. It was all wicker. Four seats total with a nice table and a bench seat as well. Internet was free which is a huge plus for someone on a budget. Most hotels charge $15 plus a day and not having to spend money on that free's up cash to do what matters most on vacation, sightseeing, great food, etc. All I had to do was ask the counter for an ethernet (probably a 15 foot one at that which is nice if you want to sit outside on the balcony and use your laptop). I dont know why people complain about the free internet being slow. It worked fine with my laptop. The bathroom was adequate for our stay. Nothing too fancy. The bathtub/shower did show some wear as well as the fixtures in it. The toilet did run after it was flushed but all you had to do was jiggle the handle and it stopped right away. If there is one thing the Aqua Surf & Spa should upgrade next it should be the bathroom. But again, it was fine for my needs. The kitchenette is a nice addition to the room. It had a small microwave, mini-fridge, small sink and actual flatware and silverware to eat with. We stopped at the Food Pantry right nextdoor and stocked up on some drinks and food. The Food Pantry nextdoor is a great thing to have. Whatever you need they pretty much have. Yes its a little pricey but then again what isnt in Hawaii? The parking garage is small but we never had any trouble finding a spot for the rental car. Parking is $20 a day which is pretty standard for most area hotels. During our stay we wanted to know where the best place to rent a decent surfboard was (places on Waikiki Beach can be ridiculously expensive). The front desk told us that Mark the facility maintenance guy at the hotel was a surfer and could help us out. The first day in our room we called the front desk and within 3 minutes he was knocking at our door. The guy was great, telling us where to rent a board, great places to grab food, etc. He should seriously be in customer service or relations or something. For the remainder of my stay there whenever Id bump into him we'd stop and have a chat. He always remembered my first name. Its nice to see there are still employees like him around. The one thing I was bummed about (though no fault of the hotels) was that our luau at Paradise Cove (amazing experience, if you go pray you get Cousin Bronsons bus, he's a riot) was the same night as the hotels free cocktail party with Tim Clark the manager, so I missed that. I did a lot of research and reading of reviews on the hotels in Honolulu/Waikiki and decided on the Aqua Surf & Spa because of its quiet location (the walk to Waikiki beach was around 8 minutes), the price of the rooms, free internet and most of all because whenever there is a bad review written here, Tim Clark the manager always leaves a comment and is very polite about everything. Stuff like that goes a long way with people, Im proof of that. I hope this review is helpful (as are the pics) and that if you choose to stay at the Aqua Surf & Spa you have as great a time as I did. Nextime Im back in Oahu i'll be staying there again.Aloha & Mahalo!",Huntington Beach,"yamsi12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach</strong>",15,5.0

I'll start with the positive; the hotel is in a prime location that's within walking distance from Waikiki beach and all of the shopping destinations in the area. If you want to hop on the Trolley and head to Ala Moana the pick up point isn't far away. The hotel itself is pretty clean and doesn't offer any added frills which keeps the costs down. My mattress was a little in the old and uncomfortable side but they are in the process of replacing them all with new beds. The staff was friendly and accomodating. I don't have a lot of negatives to add but I will say that the entrie Waikiki area is very noisy and you may hear traffic and/or sirens going off. This is unavoidable and really isn't controlable for the hotel. The only thing that got on my nerves was the extremley slow and small elevators. There are only two elevators that always seemed to be packed with people and the wait could be a little while if there were a lot of people or it was a peak time. The only thing I would recommend the managment to address would be asking the housekeepers to spend a little extra time cleaning the showers. My room's shower reminded me of a gym shower stall after rush hour. Other than that I don't have any real complaints but next time I'm in Honolulu I'm going to spend a few extra bucks and stay at one of the nicer resorts.",,TheNickSD,3,3.0

I spoke with Vinh at the front desk ,explained to him that i asked for early check in,it was only 8a when we arrived,he apologized and said they were sold out the night before ,but took my cell # and said he would call me as soon as a room was available, He did just that within 20 minutes he called me to say they had a room available and even gave me alittle larger room to accomodate my disabled husband and child's bed. The continental breakfast every morning was wonderful!! Pancakes made fresh while you wait, toast,juice oatmeal, donuts,coffee, fresh fruit and a smiling staff and a free Honolulu newspaper to read,much more than i expected, saved us about 20.00 a day for breakfast. and the staff was great. friendly and quick to accomodate our needs, I stayed at the Hyatt regency last year with an ocean front room,while that was nice, the aqua aloha surf was a much homier feel. and the managers reception on tuesday night was a great opportunity to meet Tim the hotel Manager,he was bar tending. and no limit to the drinks. there is a laundry facility in their basement,they have change at the front desk, with an ABC store on every corner very convenient,the Beach was 3 short blocks away, Parking was 20.00 a night, but a little birdy in the hotel lobby told me about a hotel down the street about 6 blocks that was only 10.00 per night, a 10 minute walk. on Kuhio avenuethe Aqua Aloha Surf is a.Great Hotel I will stay again we travel there twice a year to visit family and will recommend this to everyone,as far as noise every one speaks of, yes there is alot of street level noise we were on the 11th floor, but you are on vacation in beautiful Waikiki, why would you want to sleep in and miss the beautiful sunrise,or go for a walk on the Beach ?","Las Vegas, Nevada","twins0803</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",2,5.0

Before going into the details, I will say that we had a wonderful visit, and would definitely return. Here are the details:First, Tim (the manager) is the best. We communicated via email before our trip and he was quick to reply (unlike most managers) and assured me that all my requests would be met (room away from the street, high floor). Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised with a room upgrade and wine/chocolates because he remembered that this was our honeymoon. The hotel entrance was great - it was recently remodeled and is very inviting - open layout, comfortable chairs, TV, etc. The person checking us in was quick, nice, and professional.Our room was exactly what we needed - a comfortable bed, functional A/C, sofa, mini-fridge, microwave, coffee-maker, etc. As most reviews point out, the rooms are not huge - but it all depends on what you want and need, for most people it's large enough. The sink was clogged when we arrived, and maintenance repaired it in 15 minutes. I mention this because any time we needed something, they took care of it immediately. High-speed internet is free, although wired (they provide cables). The hotel offers beach towels - you just sign them out and drop them off when you're done. This was very convenient since we didn't have to pack beach towels and we had fresh ones each day.The free breakfast is hit or miss. The food is great considering most hotels don't offer free breakfast. There was coffee, juice, muffins, fresh fruit, toast, and pancakes. The only issue we had was that some people were very rude - note that this has nothing to do with the hotel, it is with some guests (I won't mention where they were from, but I've run into this a few times). They would cut in line rather than wait their turn, and a few times as I was waiting for pancakes, they would put their plate over mine and ""steal"" my pancake. If they somehow had better crowd control, it would have been more pleasant.My wife took advantage of the spa in the lobby - and had a wonderful experience. She highly recommended a massage (I did not get one).The location is one of the best things about this hotel. It's centrally located within walking distance from many eateries, drugstores, shopping areas, and the beach. Everything is within a 10-15 min walk. Parking was $20/night and we chose to pay it for convenience. Apparently there are places nearby where you can park for less, but we thought it was worth the extra money. There aren't many spaces, but we never had an issue finding a spot regardless of the time.The staff as a whole was great. We don't remember their names (sorry!). I do remember Nolan helping us a few times, and of the 3-4 people we interacted with, they were all wonderful. As I said in the beginning, Tim the manager made sure we enjoyed our stay from beginning to end. In summary, we had a wonderful stay, and when we return to Hawaii, we will definitely stay here again. It is by far the best deal - you get a great room in a wonderful location with excellent staff. To Tim and the rest of the staff, thank you for making our stay a wonderful one.Michael",mxc305,"Michael C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>mxc305</strong>",5,5.0

My mum booked the Aqua Aloha Surf for their rooms, so I booked it for mine too. When I checked in I was greeted very nicely by the front desk staff. The lobby was very cute and very clean, and the check-in process was quick. We jumped in the elevators and went up to our room on the 8th floor.Now since I was only staying one night, I booked the Deluxe Room with a Private Lanai. Best Decision Ever. The room was very nice and very clean. The couch and coffee table was a nice touch and the lanai was nice to chill out on. The linens on the bed were very crisp white and the kitchenette area was clean. There was a microwave, small refrigerator, plates, silverware, cups, etc. The deluxe room was large too. I heard some complaints from people who said the regular rooms are too small. But the hotel prices are usually so low that it should be okay to splurge for the upgrade.The bed was extremely comfy and I did not hear any excessive noise like other people claim to have heard. I had no issues with this room and thought it was excellent.I had one small issue, and I discussed it with Tim, the hotel manager, at the end of the Manager's Reception when I was visiting my family on Tuesday night. He took care of the small issue and was very polite about it. He even gave me his business card if I felt it necessary to contact him in the future. And btw, the reception was great! My parents loved the free cocktails and I enjoyed my pineapple juice (due to the under-21 factor). Another employee was walking around taking pictures of guests and took e-mails so that everyone got a free picture of their family emailed to them. Yet another employee was walking around with chocolate-covered mac nuts, all while free massages, charactertures, and live music was going on.The pool is small, but it's warm, clean, and deep. The pool chair are very comfortable and their is a large grill that guest's can use next to the pool. Take advantage of making your own dinner one night next to the pool! Oh, and the hotel checks out beach towels for the pool or the beach, yet another freebie.The hotel has a free breakfast from 7-830am (I think that's the times). This was surprising a good breakfast, there was juice, coffee, tea, donuts, fresh pineapple, muffins, toast, and an attendant making pancakes. My family ate their every morning, probably saved them $20 each day. I had it when I stayed, it was really good and a nice treat to have breakfast ready in the lobby.I've stayed at the Double Tree and the Hyatt before, both in Waikiki. Between the three hotels I've stayed at, I'm choosing this one again. I've been recommending it to people I know coming to the islands and anyone else that is looking for a Waikiki hotel. The price is fantastic and the hotel is clean and a great deal!I am planning to stay here again at the end of July, I really was that impressed by the value. Whether you're visiting the islands or you're a Kama'aina, I suggest this hotel. Now, nothing is perfect. So if I had to make suggestions I would say that the elevators was a little warm and stuffy, and also that you should plan on parking somewhere else because it seemed like there are maybe 20-25 stalls total for the hotel and they are $20/night. The fitness center is like two work-out machines behind a screen in the front lobby, go for a run on the beach or a swim instead. Also, the lanai furniture is just basic plastic patio chairs. But it works for chilling on the lanai at night!So thank you Aloha Surf for an excellent stay and thank you Tim for the lovely reception.(Yeah, I know this is lengthy, but my favorite reviews are the helpful ones with lots of info!)","Las Vegas, Nevada","seaturtle_808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",24,5.0

The rooms are small, but are well laid out so the size is not a problem. The hotel has been recently remodeled into a modern stylish look that makes it feel a step up from typical moderate priced chains. It is truly only 2 blocks from Waikiki beach- close enough for an easy walk to the water, night life and food, but far enough that there is less street noise at night than at some other hotels (this is important at 11pm when you're body still thinks its 3am). The staff were amazingly helpful with everything- transportation advice, referrrals on car rental agencies, directions, food recommendations, upgrades available- everything (thank you Nolan and Helene- you were a great help!). The manager, Tim, is very friendly and accessible, and does a reception every Wednesday evening with free cocktails, chair massages and a man playing ukelele and singing- all while you sit in the open lobby or by the pool and relax. There is a large propane grill by the pool for guests to use if you'd prefer to cook, which is nice given food prices. Breakfast in the morning is pancakes, oatmeal, toast and fresh fruit- much better than the typical danish and coffee spread at most places. We were very please with Carmencita in housekeeping who did a great job in our room every day too. Could not have asked for a better stay, and don't think it's possible to find a better value for such a perfect location.

The hotel was full, so the front desk person called travelocity to see what happened with our reservation. He was kind enough to wait on hold for a long time before reaching someone. After learning that our reservation had not gone through, he gave us a jr. suite at the same price we paid online. I was thankful that we didn't have to go to another hotel (it was almost midnight). The whole thing probably took nearly an hour to resolve; they went beyond the call of duty in my mind. The rooms are nothing fancy, but meet your needs for a clean, convenient place to sleep.

If there is an area they need to improve on, it is their wifi capability in your room - always ""low"" and not so reliable. But this is one of the very few hotels in Waikiki Beach with free breakfast and free wifi - and the prices to stay are a real bargain.

I didn't get his name but he was very friendly and informative. He asked if we were celebrating any occasion during our trip such as an anniversary or honeymoon and we told him yes, our anniversary. So he said they would send us up some champagne and we never received it during our 9 night stay. I thought that was really kind of strange and it upset me. Why even ask, right? Also during our check in we were told that their parking lot was full and told we could park at another hotel location a few blocks away. I asked if it would be discounted due to the inconvenience and the answer was no. Luckily I was able to locate parking at a better rate online prior to our arrival and that's what we used for the duration of our trip. During the day (from 10am-6pm I believe) the hotel offers their parking for free to their guests. One day after we parked during these hours and then told the female receptionist just for courtesy she asked how long we would be there and said we may have to move our car by 4 even though it was free until 6. I never understood this. It all ended up working out but made me feel like other guests were more important than us since there were empty spaces at the time and it was free another 3 hours. Free is free right? It was first come first serve so this upset and confused me.The complimentary breakfast is better than most hotels but near the end of our trip the pineapple seemed a little rotten and we couldn't eat it. The first 6 or 7 days it was great. All the other food was good. I liked having the oatmeal and fruit everyday. There's a good variety sure to please everyone. Toast (white and wheat) with butter and cream cheese, donuts, muffins, oranges, pineapple, coffee, tea, juice, water, oatmeal (brown sugar on the side), and pancakes and syrup. I think that's everything : )We had a corner room so our balcony was open on both sides instead of having a wall on one side. It was a gorgeous view of the Ala Wai/mountains/downtown that we enojoyed daily. If you prefer a view you'll be on the street side and if you're a light sleeper you'll want to bring earplugs. The windows don't block out any noise and there's a lot as early at 4 am. I would stay in this room again though just because I think the view is worth the racquet and we're east coasters and were in the habit of waking up by 6 or so anyways. It didn't really bother us.Our room had everything we needed and more. A good sized safe, maybe 10 x 14 or so..?, a mini fridge that's on the large size which we put to great use, a microwave, coffee maker, 3 large drawers that all our clothes fit into. We were realyl happy with it. Everything was very clean. Like other reviews I read the only thing I would say is the tub area could use a re-do but honestly it's not that big of a deal. We were in Hawaii so the last thing on our minds was our shower! We were only in the room to sleep and shower and the room served that purpose just fine. Don't get me wrong, we had a great trip and if/when we return to Oahu we would probably highly consider staying here again. It's about a 5 minute walk to the beach and is very centrally located.

The room looked quite worn. Wall paper wasn't changed the last 15 years I guess. The room had the charm of a low prices motel with its cheap furniture. Size was small too. The bath room was small too, but looked somehow newer and more acceptable.The windows had zero sound insulation and every vehicle that passed, or people talking outside on the road by was noted. Worst was the rubbish truck that came every morning about 06:00 am and parked with running engine some time in front of the hotel.After our complain we were given a room to the rear of the hotel which was more quiet. Still worn though. A few other points: Location: About 5 Minutes walk to Waikiki. That's very good.Lobby: quite open and spacey. Nice looking.Breakfast was included. It was quite simple, but absolutely sufficient for me. The coffee (important for me!) from the dispenser was good too. What was not good was the timing from 07:00-08:30 - and it closed 08:30 sharp. We were on holidays and don't really like to get up so early to catch breakfast. That was one issue, the other issue was that the breakfast area had limited seating. On days when the hotel was fuller guests had to venture to the lobby to find an empty seat. IMHO they should extend the breakfast time to at least 09:00 - or better 09:30. Internet: The rooms have free wired internet which works well.Staff: There wasn't too much staff interaction for us, but they seem all very nice and friendly.Conclusion: I would not stay in that place again.

We thought Hawaii was supposed to be home to friendly people and offer exceptional service, boy were we wrong. My husband and I have traveled to many countries and stayed in MANY hotels; out of all the places we've stayed at, this was the worst place. The room was tiny and not worth what we paid for.

This was not great since we got a smaller room, even with the upgrade but hey, we didn't complain because of the deal we were getting. What were the 2 things that prevent me from giving this place the same review as the first was that the breakfast seemed to go down in quality. Not a huge deal but I just remember more fruit and more juices the first time. The second, and bigger issue was that our room was next to the parking lot of the grocery store next door. There is an enormous banyan tree in that lot which has been around forever. If you're staying on the lower floors, you'll find that as soon as the sun is about to rise, those birds start chirping like nuts.

For someone who likes to sleep til 8am or 9am, their chirping at 5am caused a problem. I asked to change rooms but the hotel was full so I used earplugs but I could still hear them...

The staff were great and quite helpful. The hotel even left us 2 small bottles of champagne and a box of macadamia nuts when they noted we were celebrating an anniversary!

The lobby is incredible, great for relaxing, and the rooms were surprisingly modern. I was expecting problems with cleanliness and the air conditioner, both of which are issues at another Aqua property, but I was very pleasantly surprised.There were a total of 14 of us staying in 6 rooms for a family reunion for 9 days. The only complaint we had was it was difficult to get them to set up the booking in advance and get the quote... kind of had to keep pestering them. (It finally took a message like, ""Really? In this economy you WANT us to take our $6000 down the street?"") But once we eventually got the quote, we were delighted with it, and the service at the hotel itself was fantastic.The pool, and poolside area is a bit of a joke, so if that's what you're looking for, you'll probably want the Princess Kaiulani down the street. It has a better setup overall (big pool, sunning area, restaurant, bar, live music at night), but if you're mostly looking for a room for crashing, the Aqua's rooms are nicer. I will definitely stay here again.Make sure to ask for the rooms that face out onto Kanikapolani (?), those give you a view of the canal, and DON'T have you looking into the rooms of the hotel 30 feet away across the alley.",North Vancouver,"J_Clovenhoof</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Vancouver</strong>",3,4.0

Originally thought we might have a bit of a hike to the beach from the Aqua Aloha but were very pleasantly surprised! A few minutes pleasant easy walk with all the beach gear and a 6 year old (who generally didn't like walking far at all in the heat!)Right next door to the Food Pantry supermarket, and our favourite inexpensive eating spot ""Perrys Smorgy"" was on the same block. Very close to bus stop. For our purposes we couldn't have got a better location.Hotel amenities/services: Loved the lobby with the surf videos playing behind the desk. The free breakfast was much appreciated, yes it does finish at 8.30 so we needed to be organised but were happy with that. Pancakes, donuts, toast, fruit. Can't quite remember if there was cereal as well (getting mixed up with other hotel breakfasts!) You do need to show your room key to enter the breakfast room, we saw a couple of guests argue about this but I think it is a fair enough rule. Only possible downside to breakfast was that at the time we stayed it got very busy, by 8.15AM both the breakfast room and lobby seating got quite full but you weren't able to take food away to your room.Didn't use the pool but it looked fine.Weekly Managers reception with free drinks was a nice touch.No problems with room keys, elevators etc.We loved how this hotel was smaller than a lot of others and seemed quite peaceful compared to the full on activity in the lobbies of the larger hotels.Room: We had a triple all-in-one room on 12th floor and were thrilled with it, couch plus table, kitchenette and enough play space to keep my daughter happy. Room was clean and well maintained, saw one cockroach on first night but he didn't return and I know a few bugs are to be expected in a tropical climate (according to the guest book the hotel will attend to them if reported). No noise issues at all (apart from a few sirens going past which is par for the course in a city).Staff: All of the staff whom we came in contact with from housekeeping to maintenance to reception were friendly,approachable and helpful. We had a lovely chat to Mark the maintenance man who came in to change over the lightbulbs (he should have an official guest relations job!). Our housekeeping lady was lovely and always arranged my daughters toys nicely on the bed (daughter really appreciated this!) The desk staff were very helpful with sightseeing/attraction information. The lady on the desk ordered a taxi for us to get to the airport and she ran through our schedule with us to make sure we would be there with time to spare (this was a few days after the security breach which led to extra checks and longer lines at airports). On a prior trip to Hawaii we had stayed at a hotel (since demolished to make way for a new shopping complex) whose desk staff were quite indifferent towards us so we were really appreciative of the Aqua Aloha's employees.We would definately stay at this hotel again, even though the exchange rate has picked up considerably!","Canterbury, New Zealand","omalleycat_9</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canterbury, New Zealand</strong>",18,4.0

Compared to all the other hotels in the area, it's soooo cheap! It's only a 5 minute walk from the Waikiki beach and serves a fairly decent free breakfast. (Pancakes, toast, muffins, fruit.) Unfortunately the price and the breakfast are pretty much the only saving graces, because the hotel is horrendously run down. We booked the the cheapest room in the hotel and it was advertised as having a queen bed. After checking in we walked into a tiny room with a tiny full bed and a crappy, dingy stand-up shower. The room was on the 3rd floor and we were woken up at 6am by next door construction and traffic noises from a nearby busy road. This wasn't going to fly, so for 20 bucks/night we upgraded to the deluxe suite on the 14 floor. This room was considerably quieter, had a normal queen bed and a balcony. It also had a very stained couch, very stained drapes, a dingy bathroom, and a toilet that wouldn't stop running. Since this was one of their nicer rooms, I'm assuming all of other rooms in the hotel are in a similar state.So if you are broke and just wan't to go Hawaii, this place is for you.

Food is very expensive in Honolulu as well (but we knew that ahead of time) The fitness area is 3 pieces of equipment hid behind a screen in the lobby. Pool was tiny as well. We purchased our trip on nwa.com so I suppose since we had already paid they stuck us with the crumby roomsPros: great free breakfast (but it ended at 8:30 so you better be an early riser & you can't take food to your room) The location was relatively nice, only a couple of blocks to the beach but there were so many sirens I felt like I was staying in New York City.Overall I would spend a couple hundred more and stay at a nicer place.",north dakota,"savetheearth09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>north dakota</strong>",8,2.0

In fact, the hotel was booked as part of a package. I had just come off a seven-day Hawaiian Cruise on Norwegian Cruise Lines PRIDE OF AMERICA. As the saying goes: ""You get what you pay for."" I got exactly that: a decent room with limited amenities at a fair price. I needed something close to everything and this hotel is close to the beach, shopping, and local tourist attractions. One added convenience was the free internet and free local calls. If you do not have your lap top, you can access the world wide web for a fee in the internet cafe which is situated in the lobby. The service from all employees from the front desk to the chamber maids was fine. All my requests were met efficiently and with a great deal of professionalism. The Aqua hotel is part of a chain and there are a few of these properties with different names such as the Wave and the Surf, in and around Waikiki. Even though I was there at the peak of tourist season, during the Christmas holidays, I was gratified that the hotel was smaller thus catering to a smaller number of guests.

Also the main street is there as well and all of the shops are in walking distance.As for the people talking about the noise, it is a bit noisy but we got used to it after a dat or 2 so its not such a big deal as people are saying.","Toronto, ON","feetpeet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, ON</strong>",10,4.0

I really enjoyed the helpfulness of the staff and the location of the hotel. All was excellent and I definately will stay there again and would recommend others to save their money since most people arent in the room. It is Hawaii :) Aloha and Mahalo to the staff!","Phoenix, Arizona","scottdjakub80</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",0,5.0

If you don't want to listen to traffic, sirens wailing and drunks screaming all night, then choose another hotel — or, better yet, another island. Waikiki used to be kitschy, charming, low-key and family-friendly. It is now lined with LA-style shopping malls and populated by prostitutes, drug addicts, homeless people and the sort of vacationers who start their days with a Mai Tai or three. On our first morning, we saw two people throwing up their hangovers on Waikiki Beach, and every night we had to stroll past hookers en route to the hotel. Then, around three a.m., we were woken up by the jerk next door who liked to party all night. Other parts of the island are great, but Waikiki is a horror. Never, never again.",New York,"NYtraveler043</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",0,2.0

The hotel was a few blocks from the sea but walkable annd close to supermarket, shops and restaurants. The rooms were fine, a liitle noisy with the traffic below but not so bad you couldnt sleep. Breakfast was included, it was not much to write home about if you don't eat donuts or muffins for breakfast, but free is free.Reception staff could do with being a little more smiley and welcoming. We only stayed here for 4 days and then took off to the quieter shores of Punalu'u - beautiful.","Retford, United Kingdom","fsba20</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Retford, United Kingdom</strong>",89,3.0

My room was clean & well maintained. I’ll always opt for a small refrigerator and a microwave over a big screen TV (which I seldom turn on, anyway). After trying the anemic looking pancakes on the first morning, I bought cereal and milk from the nearby convenience store. My biggest dislike was the constant din of noise from the outside. I ended up using ear plugs every night.",San Diego,"fudgemaker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",7,3.0

It is about a 5min walk to thebeach as well as very close to all that waikiki has to offer. Our room had a microwaverefrigerator,sink and even dishes and cutlery! The rooms are a bit on the small sidebut we did'nt spend that much time in it anyway. The staff are all super friendly and we particularly enjoyed chatting with Mark! A bigaloha from the General Lee and Brenda! This was our first trip to Hawaii and we arenow hooked! We are already talking about next year! I would recommend this hotelto anyone looking for a good value place to stay that is centrally located.","Seattle, Washington","lufzpv</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",8,4.0

The room was always clean. (The cleaning staff were very friendly) The breakfast was good and you could just grab it to go. The location was the best part about it, we walked everywhere from the hotel (to the beach, the international market, even the hard rock cafe) Also if you wanted to go somewhere and didn't rent a car the hotel is literally a block away from the major bus routes. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an inexpensive hotel.","Winnipeg,MB","Jennirawr09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg,MB</strong>",0,4.0

The thing that really upset me was the fact I was asked if I wanted to upgrade for $15.00 more per night for a balcony room with a partial ocean view; I thought that would be nice so I did. The room literally smells like a sour towel. I told the front desk and they said they would send some one up to clean it. When I returned later the room still had a bad oder. The handle for the bathroom facet fell into my hand as I went to turn on the water. I woke to the sound of trash trucks at 6:00 am in the morning. I also went to shut the black out curtain because the light was shinning in my eyes, I realized I couldn't because a section was completly torn out. The place also had cracks in the bathroom walls. Paid $20.00 extra for parking that wasn't there.Had to park in the turn around and give the key to front desk so they could move it when a spot was available. Upon leaving I informed the front desk of the issues, hopefully they have been fixed.",Los Angeles,"dshawnski</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",0,1.0
