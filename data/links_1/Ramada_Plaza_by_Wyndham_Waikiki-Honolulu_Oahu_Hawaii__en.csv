Also, while noticing an odd look to the wallpaper, I investigated. Much to my dismay, I discovered a thick layer of dust all over the walls and the drapes. I wonder how many years since these rooms have been cleaned thoroughly? I don't blame the housekeeping staff for the immense amount of dust, but they also did only a cursory job of cleaning our room ( hair in the tub, and no toiletry refills for 2 days).There are also only a few balcony rooms, which we didn't have, and a week in the room at night became claustrophobic.When we return, I'll be looking for a new place.

The night we arrived, we wanted to walk out. I have an 18 year old and 16 year old, the family rooms are nowhere close to big enough. The photo’s make the beds in the family room look queen size - they are NOT, only double. When we checked in, surely the staff could have questioned whether a double sized bed would be big enough for two 6 foot brothers to share?... We went and bought a blow up mattress.It is certainly one of the cheaper options in Waikiki, but as always, you get what you pay for but even at this price, you are not getting enough. Air conditioners are useless; the wardrobe also contains the fridge and microwave so no space to hang clothes and store luggage for four people. Maybe put in beds that you can store luggage under. Cruise ships utilise space well, maybe your room designers could look at maximising the small space you call a family room. We were tripping over luggage, shoes, clothes for 5 days. If you are two couples, think about staying somewhere else, if you are a family with two young children, the family room option MIGHT be ok.The lift - many have mentioned it, nothing you can do about it and I get that. But.... the worst morning was the one where I was waiting on level 17 for 30 minutes to get onto a lift. The problem is that people are so desperate to get a lift that they will press up and down buttons, then get in regardless of the direction they want to actually go. It came to level 17 three times with so many people, it was full. I gave up and stayed in my room. You can respond that I could walk down the 17 floors by the fire escape, not everyone can do 17 flights though. The absolute worst though, was the day we attempted to get into our room to get things needed for a day out driving around the island. The door key entry unit’s battery was flat, our key wouldn’t work, and absolutely nothing was done to get us in. Reception staff told us if we needed to get in ‘right now’, we would have to go and find maintenance ourselves. We had a day planned and didn’t have time to run around looking for people, your staff, who could have helped us, especially given the state of the lift. We had no idea when we came back if we could even get inside our room. Then when we returned at around 7.30 pm or so, we parked our rental in a space while trying to get into the room, needed to leave it for about an hour before returning it to the rental office and despite the fact it was YOUR fault we were in this position, we were denied a car space for one lousy hour even though the car park was only half full - if we stayed more than 15 minutes then we would be charged ONE FULL NIGHT. If you want good service, a good nights sleep, confidence you can get into your room at any time, remotely interested staff, any kind of empathy, and even the slightest bit of flexibility, then I suggest you stay anywhere else but here. Honestly, it may be cheap but for what you get, it is too expensive. Actually, the ONLY good thing I can say is the housekeeping staff are polite, and friendly. And they have my sympathy, working with one lift and under these conditions is tough.","Woy Woy, Australia","Wearytraveller81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woy Woy, Australia</strong>",2,1.0

We went once and that was it. You are greeted by a sign that says breakfast special $8.95 - we assumed that was the buffet. The buffet is simply awful!!! the eggs were like rubber, shrivelled up sausages that have been cooked hours ago - everything lukewarm at best - most cold. coffee overbrewed luke warm - no bread for toast - corn flakes or cherrios for cereal - we were there one hour before breakfast was closed so there is no excuse for this condition. Got to the cash to pay the $18 (2x8.95) and was presented with a bill of $33. Deceiving advertising at best no mention anywhere that the buffet is more than the only signs in the restaurant showing $8.95. IT was awful - there is an ihop two doors down $10 for senior breakfast.

You are right in the middle of Ala Moana Shopping Centre and Waikiki with a 15 min walk in each direction. The hotel offers free coffee in the lobby every morning (which is a blessing) and a fridge and microwave in each room. The real prize of this hotel is the staff, we had requested an early check in as we arrived in Honolulu at 6am after a full day of travel. I was aware that early check in was not guaranteed but on arrival the staff went out of their way to get us into a room as soon as possible. They were upfront with extra costs of early check in and did offer to hold bags at no cost with concierge if we preferred to wait. I had a parcel sent to the hotel with no problems and they were strict with ID and Hotel key for parcel collection which was amazing. If you can book a tour with Yogi (or even just have a chat) do so, he booked us with a couple of tours that were affordable and amazing, he also didn't try and sell us tours he knew we wouldn't be interested in. Another HUGE plus Is this hotel has NO resort fees! Trust me, for Hawaii this is amazing! he rooms are very dated and AC/Bathrooms are in need of an upgrade but honestly it's what you need and another big plus - They have a laundry mat on premises that we had no problem with!

The staff was very efficient and friendly, which was a great welcome for us to Hawaii for the first time. We had two nights booked in a King Room after our cruise ended (Dec. 14 and 15, 2019), and because we disembarked at 8:30am, we arrived at our hotel by 9am. Because we were early, our room was not available yet (which was understandable). The hotel desk staff suggested that we could leave our luggage with the porter in a secured area (at no charge), which would allow us to walk around Waikiki until our room was ready. Because we had already eaten breakfast on the ship, we weren't hungry, and we were just looking forward to checking in, so we decided to sit in the lobby until our room was ready. Check out wasn't until 12 noon, so we knew we could be in for a lengthy wait. As we were sitting in the lobby, we decided to talk to the concierge and book the Oahu Grand Circle Island Tour for the following day (which turned out to be a great tour). The concierge was very friendly and helpful.At 10:30, we were told that our room was ready for us, so we checked in. The staff apologized for the long wait (which was out their contol), and again were very nice and friendly.It wasn't until we got to our room that we realized that we had been upgraded to a King Balcony Room, which was so nice, and completely unexpected!!Because our flight wasn't leaving until just before midnight on Dec. 16, we decided to go to the front desk to see if we could have the room for an additional night (Dec. 16). They had a look at the reservations, and saw that the room we were in was already booked for someone else for Dec. 16. Because our room was set up as an adjoining room, and the people that made the reservation for Dec. 16 had booked that room along with the adjoining room, the hotel staff began looking at another adjoining room set-up that they could move that reservation to, so that we could stay in the room until we checked out late on Dec. 16. The reservations clerk was successful in shifting that other reservation, and we stayed in the same King Balcony Room for a third night (at no extra cost to us for the upgrade).The trouble that the reservations person went through to grant our request went above and beyond what we expected, and made us so happy that we booked this hotel for our stay!Although this hotel is older, it is well-maintained and well appointed.We would recommend this hotel to anyone who may not want to spend an exorbitant amount on accommodations (when really, you shouldn't be in your room very much, other than to shower and sleep) - you are in Hawaii, after all!!Thank you to all the staff at the Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Waikiki...keep up the great customer service!!","Edmonton, Canada","lbs010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",8,4.0

We don't need the finer things (but we like them), however, everything comes with cost. Hawaii is expensive. So, we researched hotels extensively and we are huge believers of Trip Advisor. Ramada was a perfect hotel. The price was very reasonable - with a fridge and microwave. It is a 15-20 minute walk from the beach, so that is a deterrent for some, but not us. We enjoy the walk. We arrived early (and the staff held our bags - no cost. We checked out late - and the staff held our bags - no cost). The room was large and comfortable. It is your standard hotel. It is clean and staff are awesome. A special shout out to Sui, the concierge, who looked out to our luggage (and my laptop - in which I fretted. A true gentleman!!). If you love to travel, are on a budget and need something reasonable and not in the perfect location, then you will not be disappointed here.

The shower head was spraying in every direction, and it took a very long time to ""tweak"" the faucet so the water was tolerable. It was either freezing or scalding.

Adjusting the temperature lower on the unit didn't help and even after leaving and coming back, the room was still not cool. As a matter of fact I noticed the unit was off upon walking into the room and once I was in, it would kick on.

An ABC Store is around the corner. Parking is at ground level which makes parking easy and fast and is 23 USD/d. Lobby is nice and updated. Coffee service is offered there until 10a. Rooms are clean, for my personal taste a little dated but absolutely acceptable for Ramada standards. Staff was overall ok - I missed the aloha-spirt. They are overall very stiff and I would not call them remarkably nice.I did not appreciate that my room has not been serviced for 2 days in a row as housekeeping wanted to do that after 5p when I needed the room. I told them one the first day that 5p is far too late which they did not understand because on the second day we had the similar situation. When I checked out, I told the lady at the front desk that I did not enjoy living for two days in an unserviced room. She did not seem interested just said sorry and swiped my credit card to charge me in full for my room and parking. I personally think that this is rude and inappropriate as I expect to receive full service for full payment. So, I contacted the management of the hotel later by eMail and received the copy-paste-answer (sorry, discuss with responsible department, hope to get a second chance) that you can read here in every negative review. I felt really offended by that because I take my time do describe a problem and receive an arrogant and standardized reply that demonstrates that even in management there is not seriously interested in customer claims. Later that day the lady sent me another eMail and copied the service report of the housekeeping in order to prove my a liar as the report stated that on the first day the do-not-disturb-sign was on all day (which is not true) and that I ""refused"" service (well, in the evening I need the room). That really turned me angry because I do not like to be called a liar based on untrue facts. Therefore, I contacted that management lady again and told her that I do not accept being treated like that and paying full price getting reduce service and I want to talk to the general manager. Then she offered me a refund of one full night or a free night for a future stay or reward points. As I'm decent I told her that I fell a full night of refund (150 USD) is too much for that incident and I would appreciate two days of no parking fee (46 USD) for two days of no service and that I do not want reward point as I don't use them and don't know if I want to return to their hotel again soon. Then she took her refund offer back, refused contact to the general manager of the hotel and just offered me reward points instead. Now that is completely weird and a mess and I personally feel fooled by that lady and ripped off by the hotel. They still owe me money. Contacting this management lady was the worst and most frustrating experience I ever had in customer service. She proves that the hotel is inattentive and not interested in the customers, their needs, their expectations and their claims. That really was a crazy and unique experience. Maybe corporate can handle that.","Frankfurt, Germany","Kilian M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Frankfurt, Germany</strong>",10,2.0

The check in staff were friendly and even told me my room would be ready an hour early, so that was exciting. Check-in is at three and the check out is noon.

The room itself was a good size and although The furnishings and carpet were quite dated everything was clean and in good shape. The TV and super comfy bed were modern. I was also impressed that the window in the room opened a bit. The windows weren’t in the best shape but did the job. My one complaint about the room was that the bathtub did not have a drain stopper, that was disappointing.The pool area was overall pretty nice so I could see them needing more umbrellas for shade in the summer. I was very disappointed that the pool is not heated in the winter time many people came out and dipped their feet in the pool but no one (myself included) went in due to it being so cold. Surely a large hotel chain could offer that especially in Hawaii! The hotel itself doesn’t offer anything other than coffee and tea I would’ve liked to have some kind of breakfast option even for a small price.The location is overall very excellent it’s about a 25-30 minute drive from the airport very easily to access by bus or taxi. There are several shops and restaurants near the hotel itself and a large upscale shopping center as well as a pharmacy and other restaurants about a 15 minute walk away.

The rooms are large and well equipped with everything you will need for a comfortable stay. Only problem, after 9 am room service will open the door with their key without knocking, which isn't expected.Don’t expect a glamour hotel expect a hotel that is safe comfortable and does the job. Air condition is a little loud and it took awhile to cool room. Ice machine was on the second floor only. Laundry room was clean and stocked with change machine and detergent for purchase ( didn't use service). There is outdoor pool (didn't swim there). Wifi good in room and weak in lobby. Parking will cost you $25 extra per night. But if you are already member of the hotel chain then it is free. However , if you register as member at the time of arrival it is $20.No breakfast being served. Only tea/coffee at the foyer in the mornings. I hop and McDonald not far if that’s what you are into. There is a Chinese restaurant attached (with discount for hotel guest). There are eating establishments within walking distance about 15-30 minutes depending on how fast you walk. The property is also right on trolley pick up points (all 5 trolley service, $5.5 per route at). It is plus point for those who didn't want to hire car (download the app,DaBus2). From the airport you can book a ride in advance $10 per person or many taxi service provider who charges $23 for taxi.This feels more like an upmarket motel rather than a hotel so adjust your expectations accordingly.

It's a small hotel compared to some others but it has everything that you need for a comfortable stay. It has tea & coffee making facilities, a mini fridge, microwave, hairdryer & iron in the rooms. Because it's a smaller hotel it's much quieter than the larger ones like the Hawaiin Village Hilton, so for us that was a plus. What made it such an enjoyable stay was the staff, from the housekeeping who made sure our room was immaculately clean, to the concierge who helped us deal with a couple of problems we encountered with transportation. The front desk staff were very welcoming & happy to answer any queries we had. Every staff member we met were happy to chat and very accommodating, we felt very welcome. I have to have an injection to fly & upon my return flight i was concerned about where to put the used injection as i didn't have a sharpes box with me, and the nearby pharmacist was unable to help me. I spoke to the front desk & explained the situation and between us we came up with a solution & they were happy to dispose of it for me. The hotel is in an ideal location, right opposite the Hawaiin Hilton Village and the AliKai hotel, both of which you can walk through to access the beach. There are plenty of eateries nearby if you want to eat out, but there is also the food pantry just around the corner that is like a mini supermarket. The food is really fresh and there is a lot of choice, i would highly recommend, especially for the fruit. A bus stop is located right outside the hotel & all of the tour buses pick up from the Alikai hotel over the road, so everything is on your doorstep. The pool area is small, but is more than suitable for the size of the hotel. The only downside to our visit was that to book trips you cannot pay by cash, they only accept credit/debit cards, but after looking around this seemed to be the case in the majority of the hotels. Unfortunately for us we'd taken cash, but just around the corner by McDonalds is a tour stand run by a lady by the name of Cindy & she does accept cash. A taxi from the hotel into Waikiki can cost anything from $7-$10 dollars depending on where you're going. Overall, this is a fantastic little gem & i wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.",Walsall,"mel s</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walsall</strong>",20,5.0

The Ramada brand in Asia is apparently different to that in the USA and other parts of the world. Also we did not realise the cost of hotels in Honolulu was comparatively so much higher than in Asia.We were disappointed with our room as the photos on the websites appear enhanced compared to reality. The manager was extremely helpful and changed our room for another. He explained the situation of comparable standards around the globe for Ramada. The lobby wasn’t somewhere where one could relax so we went to the Hilton, Westin or Hyatt. Entertainment and food at the Hilton Hawaiin Village was nearby.There was no offer to help with luggage although the staff were very helpful and polite. The room was well appointed with power outlets, USB connectivity and wifi. Coffee in the room but we had to buy fresh milk from a nearby ABC store.The location was fine for transport and the beach.Would we stay again no.

Although booked for 7 nights we checked out after 4 nights (should have done that earlier) and moved to the marriot waikiki. If you are staying in Ramada you are about 20 minutes walk from the main beach area so it is not very convenient to step out for a swim @beach or lunch/shopping/coffee. The only good thing is that they charge any resort fees which most hotels in waikiki do charge but that is built in to their price as they are not coming cheap for the services at offer. The hotel itself is old and dated and so are the bed rooms and bathrooms...you will totally be away from the main action waikiki beach so my recommendation is to spend a little bit more and stay at one of the good hotels on the main strip i.e. kalakaua ave where you can use the pool and relax with lovely cocktails. fyi....There is a pool in ramada but it was cold and deserted.,"Hamilton, Waikato, New Zealand","garima14</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, Waikato, New Zealand</strong>",8,3.0

Finally, I was able to journey out to Hawaii for a week in 2018 from late February to early March. The hotel staff was extremely friendly and helpful. For example, a staff member taught me about an app to use for my cellular telephone in order to learn about the bus schedules. The hotel valet assisted me in how to open a coconut; obviously, this role was not a part of his job duties. Also, when I called the front desk to ask if I could obtain some shaving cream, a staff member actually brought the shaving cream to my door! I frequently conversed with staff members, housekeeping, and parking attendants, and everyone was always a pleasure to be around. The pool is beautiful and it is surrounded by coconut trees. There is a gym on the premises which is always open. There is a business center, and the views from the rooms are incredible! Most of the major sites in Honolulu are within walking distance, and if one is able to walk a few miles, he or she can visit most of the major attractions without the need to use a bus. Moreover, a bus stop is conveniently located right next to the hotel. One of my favorite features of the hotel is that it is roughly a five (5) minute walk to Waikiki Beach. Despite this hotel's location which is so close to the action, there is fortunately not much noise. The hotel was very clean, and my room came with a television, telephone, coffee/tea, microwave, and a refrigerator. The housekeeping staff would come by each morning to make the beds and to clean the bathroom. I thought that based on the excellent service and the fact that this hotel is in such a central location, I was very fortunate to pay approximately $150.00 per night. Many of the adjacent hotels charged much more money than the Ramada Waikiki. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone, and I would definitely stay here again. My only recommendation would be to serve a continental breakfast, but otherwise, I was a very satisfied guest.","New York City, New York","TennisStar602</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",91,5.0

The hotel was very busy but could tell we were exhausted (we were only in town for one day so we flew in on the earliest flight and then drove to North Shore) and were able to secure a room for us quite quickly before the official check in time, which was very nice of the staff. The hotel is in a great location. I loved that there was plenty within walking distance or just a short drive. Just two doors down is the coffee shop where they film Hawaii 5-0 sometimes. I walked by and recognized it immediately. The International Marketplace and the Ala Moana Center are very close to the hotel. What made me the most happy was how accommodating staff were to us. They gave us a late check out after I explained why we were in town and were very understanding. My medical procedure was in the morning so I would be groggy after and the later check out allowed me to rest before flying home. When we left the housekeeping employees were waiting kind of outside the room- we must have been their last room. We felt bad but they were in such good moods and very happy they did not make me feel like a burden. Staff here showed the aloha spirit. Thank you for being so kind.

You will get a decent bed etc. here at a more reasonable price. A short walk to the beach.Check in was impersonal and cold. Staff do not seem to value guests and do not seem keen to help them ( they should we pay their wages and can go to other hotels!). As it was not check in time, I was not able to access my room ( I found it hard to believe that all rooms in the hotel were not available). Nevertheless no effort was made to inform me that as soon as a room was available , they would call me. It was pretty much - ""come back at check in time"". This is silly if the room can be made available before check in time - it is good customer focused service to try and get a guest in their room before check in time ( which is late at this hotel - 3pm).Curtains only close a 1/4 of the way over white curtains ( not sure if these are see through at night when lights are on).No green tea available and staff do nothing if you request this - they do not seem to care.Wifi is free and seems to work ok.Check out time is 12pm which is good.Radio available - but no list of radio stations.Bath was faulty - the plug to keep the water in the tub was not working.If you want sheets changed you will need to leave a card on your bed.There is a sign saying that you can request a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb, razor, shaving cream and deoderant if you need these - this is helpful if you need any of these.Bible is available in the room which is helpful for those wanting to read and pray.They have water, tea and coffee in the lobby in the morning but this seems to disappear in the afternoon and evening.Computers in lobby provide free internet.There is a travel info. desk in the lobby but I found the staffmember there not very helpful and interested.The luggage you ask staff to mind is not stored away - you can see it in the lobby area - could be stolen.Some staff are not professional - e.g. one manager does not give their full name when writing formal letters to guests - this makes it difficult to reply to the right person and address them appropriately.","Sydney, Australia","Marty M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",64,3.0

Same thing when we left, different nice guy and tipped him too - those bags were heavy!!

Most of the other reviews do a great job of listing the pros and cons so I won't be redundant.One point of annoyance, though, was that twice we ordered a taxi as we were running quite late (once for an excursion, the other to get to the airport for our departing flight). I didn't have my phone available so I couldn't hire Uber so we asked the concierge to book us a taxi. Both times, once we got into the car and got to our location, the taxi informed us that they don't take credit cards. I'm not used to this arrangement as in nearly every country we travel (and we travel a lot) taxis offer credit card transactions. Both taxis they ordered were cash only. We live in Australia so we don't carry US currency with us and this put us in a real bind. I had to end up paying a big fee and it cost us tons of time both times trying to get this sorted. I almost missed my excursion. I don't know why the concierge doesn't ask if we have cash or try to arrange a ride that accepts credit card.

It is set back from a busy street, with almost no frontage on teh main road across from the monster Hilton Village, but the location makes the Ramada both quieter and smaller than the average Waikiki hotel while being well situated for access to the beach, the bus, and restaurants. The front desk is across from the entrance, so the staff are right there to greet you and maintain security. The hotel is small enough that the staff recognize you. There's free coffee in the morning--until 1 p.m., unlike my previous hotel, which took away the coffee at 10 a.m. The lobby has marble floors and classic rattan and bamboo furniture. Rooms are not stylish, but they are comfortably and well furnished: the brass lamps have pineapple details that are repeated in the green-and-gold (pineapple-colored) bedding, upholstered armchairs, and drapes. We had a balcony overlooking the pool and street, but set back from both for privacy and quiet, and enjoyed eating breakfast out there (room had fridge, microwave, and coffee-maker). The room had lots of small comforts: no desk (chose not to exchange the balcony for a desk), but the table was adequate for work (sigh--not a vacation); good free wifi. Good bed, pillows, and sheets. Two comfortable stuffed armchairs. Quiet toilet for middle-of-the-night use. Even a retractable clothesline over the tub. (And a tub, not just a shower.) Ample big towels. Exquisitely clean bathroom: the prefab shower is not fancy, but the walls had perfectly white silicone sealant, and a tub soak was not marred by the sight of dirt in any corners.

I think Waikiki is a sub-par Hawaiian vacation experience. Frankly, I think it's nuts to fly thousands of miles to a ""tropical paradise"" and spend your vacation in the concrete jungle that is Waikiki. Not that the place is completely without it's charms. But as far as I'm concerned, if you're spending more than 2 days of your Hawaii vacation in Waikiki, you're wasting your money.With that bias in mind, the Ramada is a reasonable place to stay in Waikikl for the price. I'd classify it as a 2 1/2 star hotel. Location is good, a little more than a 5-minute walk to one of the best Waikiki beaches. Staff is friendly and helpful. There are even some streets nearby you can park your car on for free (requires some effort to find a space though) if you want to save the hotel's $20 parking fee. For an older hotel, the elevators are zippy. Rooms are small; I don't recommend a family of four stay here for more than a night. And while the rooms are reasonably clean, some refurbishment is sorely needed. Like we had 2 arm chairs in our room that wouldn't cut it in a fleabag motel (fabric worn down). It's weird that management would think it was OK to leave them in a guest room. There were also some gaps in the bottom of the window panes that let Waikiki's considerable noise into our room (particularly bad if it's early morning garbage truck day).Bottom line, there are a lot of mediocre but acceptable places you can stay in Waikiki. Pick the Ramada if the value is better than the alternatives (if you have Wyndham Rewards points, consider their cash and points rates). Expect an OK place to crash. Do not expect a fancy hotel stay. Unless you're strictly a ""city person,"" limit your stay to a couple of nights and get out and explore the rest of Hawaii.","Philadelphia, PA","Dave R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, PA</strong>",1182,3.0

Does not have any food service within the hotel, though they do provide free tea and coffee in the mornings. We also had to pay $25 a night for parking, which for the price of this hotel seems outrageous (thankfully only did this one night). Staff were mostly really helpful, but we had a few interactions with some rude staff too. The only thing it has going for it is its central location and proximity to the beach, which is probably what allows this place to charge such a high rate.

The front desk clerk mentioned the time, but did not hesitate checking me in, which was very much appreciated since I had been in travel mode for the last 10 hours. It is a quiet property which fronts a main street though Honolulu. The back, however, is up against a small one-way street. You can't see or hear the ocean from the property, but the walk to the beach was only 5-10 minutes. There are numerous places to eat along both sides of the street. Some are offer local fares, and some are from national chains. The property is used by several major airlines as a lay-over hotel, but this did not affect my stay in the least. The room was quiet and clean, and the bed was comfortable. My only complaint, and it is minor, is the parking was very tight. Although, I never found the lot full and I was there during the weekend prior to the 75th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. I very much would stay at this property again.","Oakhurst, California","davidmJ3850GQ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakhurst, California</strong>",0,5.0

The hotel is just across the street from the Hilton Hawaiian Village, with its associated shops/restaurants. It's a 8-10min walk to the very large Ala Moana Center (check out Poi Bowl in its food court for tasty Hawaiian food at a steal). Waikiki Beach is 20-25min walk away. The room is large, clean, and comfortable; it comes with work desk, dresser, TV, armchair and ottoman, closet area, microwave, fridge, and coffee maker. The king sized bed was nice. The bathroom is a bit too plain and white, but fine enough. I found the coin operated laundry really convenient, and it was one of the reasons I chose this property. The pool is on the second floor, and has a bunch of chaises and separate dining area; towels are provided; pool was a bit cold in November though when I visited. I loved that the hotel is just across the street from the entrance to Kahanamoku Beach, which is beautiful, and imo, more peaceful than Waikiki Beach. They gave me late check-out, but it was only 1hr later (1pm instead of 12pm) -- there is an option to extend your stay to 5pm if the room is available for an additional $75. Delicious Kona coffee was available every morning in the lobby. This Ramada seems more amenity heavy compared to other Wyndham properties, likely because of its location in Hawaii. At about $110/night, I found it a good value, and would recommend it.","New York City, New York","fielight</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",78,4.0

I stay at a lot of Wyndham properties, and this one is a winner.The check-in was quick and the staff was very friendly throughout my stay. My room request was granted and I enjoyed the welcoming gift for Diamond members of Wyndham Rewards. The room faced the rear of the property and was well appointed and exceptionally clean, with great views of the neighborhood. The pool area was nice and I was surprised how despite the hotels location, received a lot of sun each day.I had breakfast around the corner at McD's each day (I love their Hawaiian Big Breakfast with rice, eggs, Spam, and local sausage) and then walked the length of the canal to the zoo, had coffee on the beach at The New Otani, and then walked back across Waikiki by a different route each day.I then sat out by the pool until late afternoon to get some sun, then walked over to Ala Moana Park for the sunset views, and then to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Ilikai in the evenings for entertainment. The Ala Moana Mall and the Ward Center are both an easy walk and have great shopping and fantastic food court options. The fort is down and across the street and makes for a nice stroll.I liked the morning coffee service in the lobby and there were a lot of airline crews staying here, so you know it is a safe place. They also have a discount price available deal with the all-you-can-eat place next to the lobby.In other words, this is a great place to stay, surrounded by more expensive places.For meals, I recommend the pink chiffon pancakes at Cinnamon's at the Illikai, and everything at the Wailana Coffee House - both nearby.I can't wait to build up some more Wyndham Reward points and come back for a full week.","Kettering, Ohio","SenseIntoDollars</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kettering, Ohio</strong>",207,5.0

It's a central location between Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana Shopping Centre - an easy walk to each. The Trolley Bus and The Bus stop just out the front. (Just beware on the way back that there's a bit of a walk because there's no close crossing over Ala Moana Blvd to the Hotel.) There are a number of restaurants close by including a 24hr one and there are two close ABC shops!The rooms are clean and whilst not huge the bed is and it's comfortable to boot!There is a laundry with washers and dryers.The pool and gym are ok - although our one complaint with the is that the pool closes at 9pm (which is fine) but we were sitting out by the pool waiting for clothes to dry - it was a hot night and we didn't want to sit in the room with the dryers. The door of the laundry was opened out onto the pool area in any case. The security guy had been past a couple of times and spoken to us - I was reading and my husband drawing and we were clothed and fairly obviously not going to jump in the pool and on his third swing past he told us we had to go in. I pointed out that we weren't in the pool and were waiting for clothes to dry and it was really hot in the laundry but he was not interested - so we ended up in the hot laundry with the door to the pool area still open! So maybe there needs to be a bit more flexibility!Also, although the staff are great with looking after your luggage it might help to perhaps try and have some rooms for those of us who arrive at 7am after the long haul flight from Australia.

The location is wonderful, we walked to dinner and shopping every night and the beach is just right across the street through the Hilton Hawaiian Village, which is a nice walk. The staff at the Ramada was extremely warm, welcoming, and helpful. We didn't have any problems with our room, everything worked fine except on the second to last day the TV remote stopped working but we were able to get assistance with that right away (replaced batteries). The shower head is adjustable and there is plenty of hot water. Ice water is always available in the lobby and in the mornings, they provide coffee and tea. Even when we slept in and didn't leave our room until after noon, our room ALWAYS got made up (housekeeping was wonderful).There is a 24/7 parking lot attendant which is nice so your vehicle is safe. We originally planned to park on the street for free to avoid the parking fee, but quickly found out that street parking is hard to come by - there are a lot of condos and hotels around so it's difficult to find a spot on the street and frankly isn't worth the headache. By signing up for the free Wyndham rewards program we saved $5 per day on parking which was a nice deal since we stayed 7 nights.

We are well travelled and stayed in a range of resorts, hotels, motels and time share.The Ramada is in the timeshare group so we decided to support them, we paid cash. I did allot of searching prior to booking this hotel and for the price we paid, and no resort fee we could not complain at all. This hotel is well located across from the Hilton Village, a 10 min walk to the major shopping centre. We were really happy with the location.We were welcomed upon arrival and the hotel was able to accommodate an early check in which was great as we did travel from New Zealand. The room was very big and had a king size bed with allot of pillows for comfort. There was a desk and another chair with foot stool which was great for extra seating. The room has a safe, coffee making facilities, fridge and microwave which was good too. There was a bath with shower over with excellent water pressure. Loads of space to store our two very large cases too.The rooms are cleaned daily and soaps etc..replaced each day. I was really impressed with this. There is a full laundry room by the pool area and the pool itself was fantastic. There is a full gym onsite too. At the pools there are toilets and towels for you to use when swimming. During our stay there were outside renovations happening however NOT once were we disturbed and we did not even know this was going on.We booked our rental car through the activities desk and the service was great, no complaint again.Overall - we were very happy with our choice, for the cost we were very happy with our accommodation, the hospitality.

Within walking distance (about 15 mins) to the largest outdoor mall, Ala Moana Mall and the Ala Moana Beach Park. The decor of the place is a little dated though the rooms are generally comfortable and clean. However, on a couple of occasions, I found strands of hair probably left by housekeeping staff on the bathroom floor and on the towels on the towel rack. But I guess this is not a big deal.Though I do have to agree with some of the reviews I have read while researching on the hotel that the hotel has a very hostile and unwelcoming atmosphere from the moment you step into the lobby and checking in. As I had arrived earlier than check-in time (arrived at the hotel at about 12-1pm), I was just told by the front desk that they do not have a room now as their check-in time is 3pm. Without advising what I can do or even if they can help store my luggages, I was just told to come back at 3pm. No smiles on the face of staffers and the staffs are nonchalant, unhelpful and at times close to rude and impatient with basic of questions and will simply give you a map without any directions, recommendations or advises. As I have forgotten to bring along a razor for my trip, I left a note in the morning to the housekeeping for a razor. But instead i got a reply note saying that she does not have a razor in her cart and ask me to call the front desk for one. So I called the front desk upon my return in the evening for a razor, I was curtly told on the phone to call the housekeeping or go to the front desk to get it. When I asked if he could help transfer the call to housekeeping, I was again curtly told that there is a housekeeping button on the phone and he ask me to call myself. Though I understand that the hotel is very popular with large Chinese tour groups, I am not sure, and I certainly hope it is not due to the fact that majority of the guests are Chinese and Mandarin speaking. and so the bad attitude Attitude of staffers needs to be improved which I seriously find unacceptable in the service and hotel industry.","Singapore, Singapore","Alex T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",3,3.0

There are no complimentary shuttles provided by the hotel from the airport, which tells its own story.Located in a 'seedier' part of town, on our walk to the hotel (and around the local area in search of a place to eat) we were accosted on several occasions by homeless people asking for money. There are very few decent places to eat within the immediate vicinity of the hotel, and instead it is surrounded by diners, tattoo parlours and seedy sports bars. The hotel itself is *very* popular with large Chinese tour groups, to the extent that the buffet attached to the hotel has signs around it written only in Chinese/Mandarin. We didn't bother going inside as looking through the window from the outside we could see that we would have immediately felt very uncomfortable once seated inside.As a result, the whole atmosphere of the hotel feels very unwelcoming.

The staff were especially friendly and welcoming each time we arrived. My only comment would be that the way some of the things are laid out in the lobby could be done more professionally. For instance, the coffee and simple amenities near the elevator (though nice to have!) looks a bit too unprofessional in how it's presented on top of a table.

Had gone grocery shopping (room equipped with microwave and refrigerator) so wanted to cut down on meal expenditures. Bellman handled all the items plus my luggage while I went to park my car.Normal routine was completed... nothing there but me:-) and I went outside to sit on the lana'i (balcony) and got a pleasant surprise: either the pigeons know NOT to come here or they just weren't around... FOR THE ENTIRE STAY. Because usually when I sit outside to eat, I usually have at least ONE land on my railing... none appeared. Lana'i was extremely clean as well as spacious.

I realized when I was there that it was a Wyndham property, so that explains a lot to me. I am not fond of Wyndham properties. There was no bar or restaurant on the site.

We weren't going to spend much time there except to sleep and to get ready for our day on the island, so the hotel was perfect for us.The facility is clean, up-to-date, safe, and the staff is friendly. I noticed airline crews staying there which I think is a good sign about a hotel. It was an easy walk to the beach, restaurants, and other attractions of Waikiki but without the noise and chaos over closer to the beach. The mall is only three blocks away but we didn't go there. The ABC stores (convenience stores) are close by, but I think they are everywhere over there.We were in a balcony room and I really enjoyed sitting out there early in the morning and at the end of the day. We had a city-view room which I think would be quieter than the rooms on the other side of the building facing the busy road the hotel is on. The area our balcony faced seem to be mainly residential and condos. There are normal city sounds (car horns, sirens occasionally, construction noise in the day), but I left our sliding door open all night to enjoy the fresh air and could sleep with no problem. Looking left out of our balcony you could see just a tiny patch of ocean. I think the rooms on the other side may have a bit bigger patch of ocean visible, but the view is mainly blocked on that side too due to the highrises and hotels between the Ramada and the water.The bed and pillows were comfortable and the room was made up well each day. There is a mini fridge and microwave in the room. Water pressure and temperature were good. They have ice water and coffee available in the mornings in the lobby. We had a car and parked at the hotel for $20 per night as Wyndham Rewards members; I think it is $5 more per night without the card. The city buses also stop right in front of the hotel. Parking seems safe as there is a person on duty and actually patrolling the lot all day and night.We didn't use the pool but it looked OK and seems like only a few people were using it at any given time. It wasn't an issue for us, but there was a sign on the gift shop in the lobby saying it would be closed until May. There is also a concierge / tourist info person in the lobby, but we had made our own plans.The only problem we encountered was the hair dryer outlet in the bathroom didn't work and wasn't fixed while we were there. We tried resetting the GFI button on the outlet but that didn't do the trick either. I had told the front desk about the problem the first morning of our stay but nothing was done to repair it before the end of our stay.All in all, we enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.","Palm Coast, Florida","JaxTom</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palm Coast, Florida</strong>",43,5.0

It is a cheap mid-level apartment block hotel. It is situated within a short walk to Waikiki and the associated bars and restaurants (which is really good).It is slightly tired in places and the $15 a day parking fee was steep. The outdoor pool was on the roof of a lower floor so was overlooked by hundreds of hi-rise apartments, so no sun after 3pm.For all that, the Ramada was a good price when it comes to staying in Honolulu. Don't knock that. A reasonable room and a slightly less than perfect location at a less than £100/night is not to be sniffed at.The problem with Honolulu is that if you want to be near Waikiki, you need to pay through the nose for an airport shuttle or taxi. If you have a hire car, you pay for parking. Oh, by the way, traffic in Honolulu is horrendous come the rush hour.However, my criteria is always ""value for what we paid"".

Our flight in was around 8:30am and raining really bad, unfortunately due to been early we couldn't check in til 3pm and after a 9hr flight all we wanted to do is wind down, after sitting in the lobby for an hr or so we freshened up and were able to leave our bags at reception til our room was ready. After walking around Waikiki (feeling much better) we headed back at 3:30pm and our room was ready. The room wasn't too bad, bed and pillows were comfy. Our room was always serviced no matter what time we left. One downfall we had was they switched the water off around 9:30pm til 6am next day which was really annoying because we couldn't flush the toilet or shower and worse part was my hubby had way to much to drink that night and spewed all in the toilet and of course it had to sit in there til the water came on to flush. The wifi wasn't the best, but the computer in the lobby wasn't to bad. Don't eat at that asian buffet thing next to it, its absolutely terrible. The trolley stops right out front which was great, and also the local bus is out front too which was great as we used it to go to Pearl Harbor and only cost $2.50 at the time. All in all was a good hotel for us, away from the hustle n bustle of Waikiki, which made it a more enjoyable walk to and from the hotel to Waikiki.

Considering this is emphasized as a selling point, it should work properly.- clock radio does not receive anything on FM, which is why I was trying to stream audio in the first place.- the pool itself was clean, but the patio was warping from moisture, and had crumbling grout between the slate flagstones. Also, a late 8am opening means no early morning swim before the kids come out...- judging by the smell wafting out, the restaurant (Wok-kiki - geddit?) was a greasy Chinese place.

The location is easy to get to and I like how the parking is right there. You don't have to park in some huge parking garage and walk so far to get to your room. The only bad thing is if you have a guest coming to see you there's no street parking anywhere close. It's always full all day long. But you can get a parking pass for the hotel parking for an hourly fee or overnight pass. The rooms are nice and I had a balcony this time which I loved to just relax on at night.

The Ramada Plaza was just a 15 minute walk from the testing centre and so I booked a room because it was the best deal in the neighbourhood for a 3 star hotel.My favorite things about the Ramada Plaza were the free internet, great air conditioning, mini fridge and microwave, and easy access to all attractions in the Ala Moana neighbourhood. My room was clean, cool, and decent sized. The shower had excellent water pressure and the shower head was very high end with adjustable massage spray. The shampoo/conditioner/moush wash/body lotion/soap were average quality. There were plenty of towels and the cleaning ladies did a wonderful job each day. The work-out room had decent but older equipment. Everything worked well and that room was kept especially cool, making a vigorous work-out much more enjoyable. There was also a nice cool drinking fountain in the workout room which was nice.The downsides were as follows: View from my window was only into other hotel windows. I did not have a view to the ocean. Even on the 14th floor, the street noise was noticeable and I was awakened one morning at 0300 by a car alarm going off.

So why do we stay in a hotel for half the trip? Because it's Hawaii! You have to make a vacation of any trip to this beautiful state. That said we choose this hotel because it's reasonably priced at about $110 a night. You can find better rates. For the money it's a true value. It's across the street from Hilton Hawaiian Village, one block from the sands of Waikiki, a short walk to the mall. It's the quietest part of Waikiki.The rooms are clean, the staff is courteous, helpful and treats us like we're in a higher priced hotel. Some people will call the stay average. I call it a bigger bang for my buck! You have to put the hotel and service in context. This is Hawaii. It costs up to $7 for a half gallon of milk. The Hilton across the street, $400 a night minimum! So for about $100 a night I get a clean room, friendly service, 1 block beach access and not a lot of tourists. How could I ask for more at these rates? Granted the views from the rooms are not spectacular, but there's an IHOP next door! I would recommend this hotel if you want a clean affordable place to stay and don't mind being giving up a few amenities nor do you mind staying at the tail end/or start of the Waikiki strip.

Our room was cleaned daily no matter what time we went out. The bed was soft and comfy. Our room had a large flat screen TV and a fridge and microwave. The hotel is right across from the Hilton which has free fireworks at 7:00 PM on Fridays. The one negative aspect was that the hotel charges $25 for parking . If you rent a car there is plenty of free parking a few blocks away near the canal. The hotel doesn't offer a free breakfast but there is an Ihop just around the corner from the hotel.

The hotel has complimentary tea and coffee in the lobby in the afternoons and there is a small gift shop which sells post cards etc as well as stamps. The pool is outdoors and there is a small fitness center as well. If you pick up some of the coupon books which are located in the lobby and all over Waikiki there are coupons for transfers to the airport for $6.95 per person. It is well worth it to rent a car and spend the day driving around the island. Hanauma Bay,The bow holes The Bydo temple, Waimea, Dole plantation etc are worth a visit.The drive is absolutely beautiful. If you are looking for souvenirs , Walmart has a good selection at good prices. Also there is still a market near the old International Market and there are ABC stores on every corner. We took a surfing lesson at Moku surf which is just a block from the main beach. We had a Groupon which we paid $45 for. We also rented a board for $20 a day. If you take a lesson they will give you a deal on renting the next day. The Kings village has a little market in the evening with Thai and Chinese food for take away for about $6.00. Taco Bell is also just a short drive from the hotel and has a the dollar cravings menu but the prices are $1.39 an item. Kmart downtown has a Little Caesars in store which has large Cheese pizzas for $7.00. There are also lots of Burger Kings , Mc Donalds, Subways etc although the prices are a bit higher than on the mainland.

The tour for both Pearl Harbour and the battleship Missouri cost approx. $US104. I found out on arrival that the Pearl Harbour entrance is free and a tour of the Missouri is $US25.

We were extremely comfortable and happy with our stay!Yes, the property is a bit outdated but the rooms are comfortable (best nights sleep I've had in a long time thanks to the super comfy beds!) and well maintained. We were on the ninth floor with a view of the buildings and parking lot out back. I wasn't happy with the view but will remember to ask for a different room the next time!I've read other reviews which complained about the street noise. Not an issue for us. We hardly noticed it. Maybe because we were on the back side of the hotel.Housekeeping was on top of things. We were always greeted with a super clean room when we returned at night.My only real issue was the coffee pot. I'm admittedly a bit of a coffee snob. The coffee provided in the rooms was incredibly weak. The coffee maker took forever to brew a small pot of coffee. I was disappointed as I thought there would be a Kuerig in our room. No worries. I purchased a pack of coffee filters from one of the many ABC stores in the area and brewed coffee from one of the plantations we had visited!The wifi was incredibly slow. It was a pain to constantly be required to sign in. But the service was free, so we can't complain too much!The hotel is located right across from the Ala Moana beach, and within walking distance from lots of shops and restaurants.The staff was extremely friendly and helpful.Overall, this was a great place to stay if you're on a budget and don't care about the glitz and glam of the other hotels in the area.","Marysville, Ohio","LemCat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marysville, Ohio</strong>",22,4.0

Further, when you attempted to click on their ""Terms of Service"" (which is required to connect to internet), the link does not work so you can't tell what you're agreeing to.

Overall, the Ramada is a great hotel based on it's location and price -- we were literally within walking distance of the Ala Moana Center as well as Waikiki Beach and all the restaurants in that area. As for the hotel itself, it's an average hotel with nothing special. Perks included the free Wi-Fi that was not slow (you can watch YouTube) and free coffee/tea in the lobby in the morning. Parking around the Ramada is terrible -- there was construction that took up a whole street of what would have been free parking, and Ala Wai is always packed. Hotel parking is $25/night (aka until 12PM the next day) and $20 for Wyndam members. Housekeeping was very nice -- I left a note requesting extra towels (for the beach and to avoid having them come in every day just to exchange the towels) and they gave us 6! We were also on the 12th floor and our room was at the end of the hallway so it was super quiet -- no view though, but we were never in our rooms anyways.The only trouble I had was when we checked out, the front desk charged me for an extra night of parking because THEY wrote down the wrong date. Thank god I saved my receipt/parking card to prove exactly when I parked in the hotel. We paid roughly $105/night and for the location and the fact that the hotel was just a place for us to store our stuff, shower and sleep, the Ramada is a great deal. Other than that, it's just your average hotel.

The excuse was that the manager had a family issue, but can not the manager on duty give the information to another manager on duty.POSITIVES.......we received chocolates from management as a apology.we asked for a night back in money as we did not get any sleep the first night, we received that.The cleaners were always saying good morning.so please make your own mind up, but if we ever went again we would go to vrbo and book a condo. so much more cheaper and can get them overlooking the ocean for $150 per night. we looked into it while we were their, and condo's are the way to go.We thank the management in finally getting back to us, and also the cleaners, who seem to be stressed to work for this company, but still find a smile and a hello.

Only negative would be it was hard to cool the room down to most comfortable sleeping temperature. Good lo action and in quieter part of city. Laundry on second floor helpful. Would stay there again.,"Omak, Washington","JERRYG448</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Omak, Washington</strong>",168,4.0
