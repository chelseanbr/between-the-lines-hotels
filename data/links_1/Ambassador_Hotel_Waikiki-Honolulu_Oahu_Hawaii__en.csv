The Ambassador Hotel is the best location for anything Waikiki. Open and airy, many room choices, great amenities. It is a beach hotel, not the Ritz Carlton but they don’t advertise that they are. I read the negative reviews before I booked and I know a lot of people are hard to please. We were to come back in on the 21st for 2 more nights before flying home. The clerks at the desk knew when we checked out we were coming back so they upgraded us for the second stay and we were not disappointed.

It was like staying at a condominium. The mini kitchen with dishes, cutlery, big refrigerator, iron, hair dryer, cosmetics. The front staff were helpful and friendly. Access to major sightseeing spots from the hotel is perfect. The checkin time is 3pm so if you arrive in the morning you need to leave your luggage at the front desk.

So we went back in the afternoon another Filipino receptionist was there, we approached her and said Hi but there was no reaction on her face, no hello, no aloha & no smile at all. We were really stunned because they work in reception and they should be welcoming guest with a smile right? seriously what's wrong with their staff? We were lucky because the manager named Geffrey Aquino was there in reception, he was so friendly, this guy have a great customer service & really knows how to look after a guest. That's all we need, a welcoming face who treat guest with respect.Honestly these Filipino background (ladies) in reception should be provided a proper customer service training in reception.

My grown son went to check out the bathroom and came back with, ""Ummm.. the shower floor looks like you'd get foot fungus from it. Maybe we should wear our flip flops when we shower..."". The grout in the shower (no bathtub) was filthy, the wall behind the sink was peeling, as was around the moulding on the floors, no counter in the bathroom - just a sink (so nowhere to put your makeup, hair straightener, etc.). The air conditioner barely worked so it was impossible to sleep in the heat (with 30 degree weather outside). The 2nd night when we came back at about 11pm my key card wouldn't work so I went down to the lobby (from the 13th floor). They re-keyed the card so I went back up but it still didn't work, so back down to the lobby. On the 3rd visit to the lobby they sent the maintenance man up with me who brought this wire thing and opened the door with it then came in so that he could replace the key card sensor. Seemed to work after that but got the sense that this happened quite often.It was relatively close to Waikiki strip (10 min walk) so that was good, but the park across the street is pretty sketchy. On day 2 there was an incident right across the street with several police cars and officers. The night before we checked out (to move locations) I inquired at the front desk as to whether I could park my rental car in their hotel parking for ONE HOUR in the morning between when I picked up the rental car and when we checked out and they informed me that they would have to charge me the $40 USD daily parking fee (for parking there for an hour at 7:30am!). We ended up checking out before we got the car just so we could get out of there!On top of the room charges they charge a $25 USD per day (+ tax) RESORT FEE!

The microwave had only one base foot on it so it wobbled and the turntable was on an angle)The room decor is well worn, chips out of benches, patches on walls, TV cabinet and storage draws stick and chips taken out of table tops, well worn decor. Just a very dirty and un-welcoming room.So after 15 minutes of contemplating on just what to do we rang reception to at least advise them upon the faulty microwave. After another 5 minutes we had a lady come and see what was wrong, she then called up the maintenance man, whilst waiting for the maintenance man we ask the lady if this is the common standard of the rooms here at the Ambassador? She was evasive in her answer so did not pursue this with her. Then the maintenance man arrived to our room and once shown the problem with the microwave, turned it on its side and literally broke the remain foot off the bottom of the microwave. This amazed us, as he did not unscrew this with a screw driver, he physically tore it off. And thought it would be ok now, we think the lady that called him was just as amazedSo now at this point we decided to go down to reception and discuss the microwave issue and the very poor condition/dirtyness of the room furtherWe started by asking is the room provided the general standard for the hotel, to our surprise the answer was ""yes"" with an explanation that the rooms have had NO upgrade for some years WOWAt the end of the conversation we where offered to have a loom at another 2 rooms that might better suit us.A little reluctant we said ok, first one was not to bad, cleaner, microwave, it had all 4 feet on the base of it , but the oven totally scratched, old and not comforting to useThe second room was clean, best of the 3, still old decor that needs updating sooner than laterAs we had been travelling for over 16 hours now we succumbed to this roomOne good thin, bed is comfortable and good hot running waterSummary - Dont bother to take them up on the partial ocean views EXTRA $ offer, as they are way to far from the beach, to see partial you will be on level 7 up to level 12 floor, and STILL only a partial view through build df ings and trees if you lean over the balcony, as the balconies are on the east and west side of the property and the beach is south- Don't expect anything flash, take it up with them if you are not happy with what your getting (better, cleaner premises with similar pricing across the road at the holiday inn), all to late for us, we have just put up with what we have got, but never again at the Ambassador Waikiki - if you do choose here, give yourself 5 minutes extra time to leave the premises as the lifts are painfully slow, strange with 3 lifts, but true, give yourself time, and if the doors open and it appears full squeeze in as it will take about 6 minutes before anotherlift will arriveWas thinking of a positive and give 2 star rating but just could not","Mornington, Australia","garrylid</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mornington, Australia</strong>",4,2.0

In fact my son's student flat is better equipped, cleaner and more up to date than this place. We booked The Ambassador as it supposedly had fully equipped kitchens- I wanted to be able to prepare the bulk of our meals as my daughter has some health issues. Lets just say, two butter knives, a single pot and fry pan, do not a kitchen make. And it was filthy and dated from around the 70's. The room, though spacious, was dingy, smelly and sparse. The ""balcony"" was a bleak, beige concrete rectangle with no furniture - just a leaking air con unit. I can only assume there is no furniture provided to prevent people from jumping off to end it all - it is so depressing there. The bathroom had peeling paint on the ceiling, the tiles were on the floor of the shower were disgusting and the sealant was mouldy. The hot water took about 5 minutes to come through, and then only once the handle was turned as far to the left as possible. Right from the start, the check in staff were rude unhelpful and downright passive/aggressive. The poor maintenance staff were kept busy trying to fix things (including the lifts, which were either not working or frighteningly slow and unstable). The final straw was after three days, I went to the laundry to discover that only ONE washing machine was working for the entire hotel, and the outside shower at the pool (which was concerningly murky) was also out of order. I went down and complained, and the staff member straight away offered my money back. She did not even try to offer any solutions. That says it all, as far as I am concerned.

The room I stayed in had a great kitchen area, with utensils and a stove-top oven. Housekeeping will take care of your dishes, too. The Ambassador also has a two-hour free bike rental available, so my husband and I rode them one morning to the beach at Fort Derussy. We had time to walk down the pier there and then bike through Waikiki to Kaimana beach and the War Memorial Natatorium, and swim. We also had time to catch our breath at the picnic tables and finish our coffees. We stopped by the Mahatma Gandhi statue and finished our trip back to the hotel by biking on the Ala Wai Canal (I did, my husband chose to remain on the road). The bikes also come with baskets as well as their own locks so you can secure your bike whenever you stop. Check your bike before you head out, as you don't want to be unprepared. It had been so long since I had ridden a bike that we did a few practice laps in the parking lot before we rode out. Returning the bikes was easy and hassle-free. The staff here are so lovely and easy to work with. There is a metal door to the lobby in front of the bike racks that is open for most of the day. Its also near the outside smoking area.The pool is on the third floor and is lovely. You can get pool towels from the housekeeping office. There is also a smoking area near the pool. I have a thing for hotel TV and their cable setup is pretty good. I've watched TV at a hotel before (on the mainland, which refers to the mainland U.S.) and was like, ""what the hell am I watching?"" as it was a very disassociated program and in short, trippy. I have no complaints about the wi-fi. The shower amenities are nice, the bathroom spacious, and the closet space is huge. The room itself was decent, clean, and well-lit, and the beds were very comfortable. There were plenty of pillows, too. We stayed here for a week and definitely plan on coming back in the future.","Honolulu, Hawaii","DrCipresso</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",2,5.0

Transportation is really easy since the bus stop is right in front of the hotel. Upon arrival, the staff was very nice and helpful. We checked into our room and although average, it needed a facelift. The room was also very dated and small. The room would have probably been okay if it were myself and my husband but since we're traveling with two grown teenage kids, it would have worked for us.I went downstairs and express my needs to the front desk. They are able to move us into a suite which was much better, but also very dated. All in all, this hotel gave us a place to hang your coat, a decent night sleep, and a small kitchen to boot.If you're on a budget, and need a place to rest and don't care about all the extras, this place is for you.

When I made the booking it was advertised at $115 a night, and ended up at over $180 after taxes, $25 parking per day and $20 amenity charges. The room, from the photos I've added, was horrible. There was mould and dust in the elevators, carpets had mould on them, they stunk, the air condition was loud and mouldy and rusted, the walls where flaking from salts and moisture, the furniture was damaged and paint was peeling off it, and had not been updated since the hotel was originally built, probably. It looks like a converted apartment block. When I complained of the condition of our room (532) and said that it looked nothing like the photos online, they showed me a model room (1409) which was used for the online photos. It was the same atrocious state. The shower was moulded and there was a salt and rust buildup on the faucets, and the plug holes where black. Light switches were yellow with age and looked scetchy.

Nowhere do they state on their site that you will be paying 25 dollars a day for parking, nowhere do they state that you will be paying 20 dollars a day for ""amenities"" which are things like watching TV and the basic things that should be included in the thousands of dollars you spend to stay there. The pictures they show you of the rooms are a farce. They are 1/3 the size of what they show and our third bed was a couch pullout bed. Shower was broken and had to be fixed twice and there were ants in the kitchen. You have a balcony with a view of hotel doors, if your curtains are open, anyone can see inside. You can't even smoke on the balcony or it's a 250 dollar fine. The staff obviously know this place is a scam. Every traveler we saw checking in had the same look as we did of utter disappointment and confusion to where all these extra charges were coming from and why nothing looked as advertised. And the staff have nothing to offer besides a 5 dollar reduction on parking each day and that's only if you bug them about it. So you basically have the choice of going to a better hotel which is anywhere, or sticking with what you purchased after the long trip to get there when your exhausted and just want to settle in. I can't believe they get away with it. Most of the patrons there looked to be from Japan and were probably just happy to be in Hawaii.

I have never been in a hotel room as outdated and dirty as this. The hotel walls were a few different colors due to hole patching. Didn’t even bother painting the room the same color. The curtains all had holes, prob the same curtains from the first time they opened in the 80s. The floor was sticky and was on dire need of a deep clean. The bathroom was horrid. Another deep clean would be nice there too. It always reeked of mildew and mold because there was no ventilation. I felt like I was back at a college dorm bathroom. The shower head was filthy with mildew and had to wear flip flops in the shower because fungus infection would be inevitable. Every time the bathroom door closes the latch that was on the ceiling would fall out revealing a disgusting dirty non working ventilation system. The kitchen was a nice add on but also very outdated. The only thing I enjoyed was that it had a full refrigerator because it kept our water and food fresh. The main door also was a problem since the deadbolt would always stick out preventing the door to close behind us. We would have to either badge back in or physically always turn the deadbolt back. Everyday after a day out I would dread coming back to the hotel. I highly do not recommend anyone to stay here.

The roaches weren't limited to the kitchen as we each found one in our dressers and, the final straw, one walked across my husband's chest as he was lying in bed. To rub salt in the wound, the manager wanted to charge us for staying that first night arguing that ""if it was so bad, why didn't you leave"" (maybe because it was 11 pm and this family of four had no where to go during a booked Christmas holiday week). We ended up checking out the very next morning.I do not recommend staying at this hotel until they exterminate the entire building.",,Bcatgal,34,2.0

The photos online looked pretty good. Unfortunately our room looked nothing like those photos. The lobby and pool area looked somewhat renovated, but from the elevator to the halls to our room, you can definitely tell this hotel is old and needs a desperate update. Our room had old appliances, old bathroom fixtures, and old furniture. Our bathroom door didn't close properly. Our view was of the other tower. The price we were charged included a lot of taxes and fees, including an ""amenity charge"" of $20/day. Though I'm sure the nightly rate was more for New Year's Eve, all of the taxes and fees pushes the cost to much more than advertised on their website. There are plenty of hotels in the area that give you more for the price we paid. On a positive note, the staff we encountered were all helpful and pleasant. The room size was larger than some of the other hotels in the Waikiki area. The television/cable worked well and we were given free refillable water bottles. The pool looked pleasant, but we didn't have time to use it.

The amenities include wireless internet access and an empty water bag for guest to fill in water on the 2nd floor. This is equivalent to forcing guests to pay internet access. The hotel also substitutes bottled water with a water bag to save money and yet this cost-cutting approach is claimed as an amenity item.More importantly, I am very disappointed with the speed of internet. The speed was way below adequate level (below 1 MB/Sec for about 50% time I wanted to use it). It was impossible to use internet. Almost all hotels I stayed provide complementary internet access at about 2 to 5MB/sec. The irony is that the hotel claims it provides ""Cutting Edge"" Wireless Internet Access as a main (fee-paying) amenity item. This is totally unfair to guests. It forces guests to pay a service that is essentially non-existent.The most disappointing part is the attitude of the hotel manager. When I reported to the manager that the internet was not working properly, he responded by claiming that I did not know how to use internet. I had to show him that the speed of internet is very low. Then, he blamed the problem on too many users, as if this is an expected condition for the hotel. As mentioned, the hotel is charging customers for internet access as a paid service.

I initially researched many properties in Honolulu & chose the Ambassador primarily because of the kitchen. We prefer to prepare our own meals convenient to our schedules & dietary needs.  The property is convenient: the reliable ""The Bus"" has stops in front of the hotel for easy transportation to most places on the island. Kuhio and Kalakaua avenues are parallel: Kalakaua is a 'main drag' for shopping & a short walk from the hotel (corner of Kuhio and Namahana). Front Desk Staff: business-like and knowledgeable, especially in assisting with directions. 2 Expedia concierges in the lobby can book all types of excursions.Maintenance: We arrived after dark; the bulb in the pole lamp was burned out; I took it to the front desk and within minutes, a maintenance worker replaced it. Rooms: clean and basic with needed comforts. Kitchenette included a great refrigerator/freezer; microwave; stove and basic cooking supplies: frying pan; kettle; spatula; slotted spoon; & 'two of everything': cups, plates, silverware.' Dishcloth & towel provided but no dishwashing liquid. Two sets of large drawers so you can unpack for longer stays. Good TV. Internet was fine. We took advantage of the free local calls to call The Bus for times and directions. We took The Bus to the Food Pantry on Kuhio but other nearby stores are available for food including the Whalers General Store on site; an ABC store is a half block away. Be prepared: Food prices are high. ($.59-$.99 a PIECE for bananas; eggs: $5.99 a dozen; milk: $7.99 a gallon.). We used the in-room safe which was easy to set up.Generous bath amenities are provided; towels: fresh & absorbent. Shower only, no tub; good water pressure & temperature. Lighting could be improved. There is one pole lamp and one wall lamp on the bedside table which was bright enough to read by. but another lamp is needed. I am not a fan of fluorescent lighting (bathroom and kitchen area). Housekeeping: good; our dishes were done one day when I didn't take time to do them. It was hard to predict when the rooms were cleaned, however. We were there for a week; we left in the morning for long periods of time to return to an unserviced room. I went to the 2nd floor Housekeeping office to exchange towels with no problem. On another occasion, I exchanged towels from the housekeeper who was still on our floor with no problem or questions asked. There is a trash chute at the end of each floor.I did laundry twice during our week stay. There are 3 washers and 4 dryers on the second floor. Price is $2.00 to wash and $.50 for 15 minutes drying time. Both a change machine and laundry supply vending machine are available. We loved the balcony and looked forward to eating outside using the ironing board as our 'dining room table' (covered with a bath towel.) The rooms ending in '01' have wraparound balconies.The property could use some color; everything is beige. The Ambassador serves us well. We will probably return to Honolulu in 2018; if so, we will book again.","Hilton Head, South Carolina","MarnetteS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hilton Head, South Carolina</strong>",178,4.0

I think her name was Emilyn - she was friendly, polite and welcoming.The swimming pool is like a small back-yard pool. If you're just wanting a simple swim - then it's good for you. However, it is only open from 10AM TO 7PM, not very convenient for the summer holidays and the fact that many people/families are out and about/shopping during this time. The pool is on level three - so don't expect roof-top views or anything.The gym, is very simple - hand-towels available, and about 3 workout machines.It is on level two -the same level as the guest laundry and housekeeping.I called reception to ask for towels for the swimming pool, she said I had to go to ""level two"" and pick it up from housekeeping. When I went there, no one was there, but there was a maintenance man who seemed to be just coming from the housekeeping direction, he was quite unfriendly - no smile, looked annoyed and when I asked him where I get the towels from and if it is housekeeping (this is on Monday 17 July) he rudely responded ""housekeeping - when I didn't hear him properly I said ""pardon"" he seemed more annoyed and said ""housekeeping""!, I went back to double-check that no-body was definitely there, and there wasn't ..so I went to leave after hanging around for nearly 10 minutes, just as I was reaching the lift to leave, another man in uniform was coming towards me. So I asked him and he nodded his head back towards housekeeping, he wasn't that friendly either, but then a lady came and thank goodness she was friendly! She gave me a piece of paper to sign with my room number and then gave me pool towels. I left with a feeling of relief and disbelief - haha! Anyway, I just thought maybe these guys were having a ""bad day"" - who knows! The next day, I called housekeeping to ask for replacement pool towels and the lady said, sorry you have to come and get it from housekeeping. (When we first checked in we only had two bath towels in the room, even though four guests were registered, so I called reception to ask for two more towels to be sent up to our room at which they arranged efficiently - so I just assumed I could do the same with the swimming pool towels). On the day of check out, I received a knock at the door from a housekeeping maid, it was 1030 am and our check-out time wasn't until 12pm. The maid asked me if we were checking out, when I told her yes - she looked impatient as though I should have already checked out. I was already expecting her to knock and was prepared to ask for four replacement bath towels and when I did, she abruptly responded ""don't you have towels?"" when I replied that we used them last night when we showered before bed and they are still really wet, she looked at her her colleague and spoke in Filipino and reluctantly gave me only two towels (whilst still looking at her colleague) - even though I asked for four. I gave up, took the towels and couldn't be bothered. Two of us just ""dried"" ourselves with wet towels.The hotel room is very older style, old hotel. The fridge had an off-smelling smell (like old fish). We had two double beds in the room, air con was great. We had a balcony. No table and chairs. It had a microwave. The location is near Hard Rock Café, about a 12-15 minute walk to Waikiki beach. Has a coffee shop below, when we asked for our croissant to be ""toasted"" they microwaved it. There is a mini-supermarket below the hotel as well. Parking is first-in-first serve and cost us $26 per 24hrs. I noticed there were ashtrays on the tables in the swimming pool area as well. Not quite sure if smoking was permitted or not or if it was a non-smoking/smoking designated hotel... just noticed the ashtrays - that's all.Our overall experience was nice, we had some friendly and attentive staff, 'grumpy' staff, and 'stone-faced' staff... overall we had a nice time and we got a good last-minute rate and the stay was still practical, only I wish the pool wasn't opened and closed for such a short time - especially during summer break.","Sydney, Australia","EM_PressAries</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",7,3.0

The Fitness Center is small (no surprise here), the bicycles for guest use are subject to a strict daily limit of 2 hours ($5 per hour over), and the unlimited Hawaiian drinking water is filtered tap water coming from 3 dispensers located next to the lobby that apparently have not been changed in a long time. The flow of water from the 2 functioning taps came out slow and tasted like pipes.

Motel 6, Super 8, etc. They're not the nicest, but The Ambassador ranks below them. What you'll find is a run-down, deteriorating property. Cinder block walls, chipped paint on the cabinets and severe water damage in the bathroom--a rusty light switch and linoleum that's falling apart. Don't expect a parking spot. Yes, parking is at a premium in Waikiki, and you'll pay for it no matter where you stay, but this property does not have enough spaces for its guests. I stayed three nights, and they always said ""We are completely sold out.""So, they direct you to a neighboring hotel, which is about a 15 minute walk--not fun in the rain. They also say it'll cost you $20, which is untrue. It's $20 for the guests of that hotel, not guests of the Ambassador. When I asked the parking attendant, he said ""Yeah, they always tell people that."" Granted, it's only a $5 difference, but it's the principle of being lied to by your hotel. Oh, and I couldn't even call the Ambassador ahead of time to ask if there were any spaces available. All I got was a busy signal, for three days straight. The hotel desk told me it was a ""problem with the Hawaii phones,"" but every other business didn't seem to have any issues.

The Ambassador is not a 5 Star resort that opens straight onto the beach front and offering a million things to do, see, eat or buy. The decor has seen better days and there is clear signs wear and tear in the rooms. However the Ambassador is clean and comfortable and considering its location - great value for money. The pool is clean with comfortable seats, tables and parasols. There is also a business centre, small gym and laundry room. The staff were very friendly and ready to help with the few requests / information that I asked of them. My room was a kitchenette on the 18th floor and was perfectly fine for my needs. There was no table or seat on the balcony but that was no real hardship. The only small problem I encountered was being awoken by the cleaner at 8:15 am. I hadn't hung my 'do no disturb' sign outside, but I did think 8:15am was still a little early to be asked. The free wifi was very good and I ran three devices simultaneously without any problem whatsoever. Those hotel is located at the bottom of the main Waikiki strip, so 15-20 min walk will get you pretty much where most of the shops or restaurants in Waikiki are. The Ala Moana shopping Centre is about a 1km walk from the hotel, but there are also numerous busses that can take you there. There was also a tour guide desk in the lobby to assist with bookings to various locations around the Hawaiian Islands. I would have be hesitation in staying at the Ambassador Hotel again.

We definitely had a few glitches: extra bed requested wasn't great and we requested an additional mattress that was more supportive; we didn't have enough plates and cutlery for all of us in our kitchenette; our toilet blocked 4 times and we had a change of fridge twice. Having said all of that, all of these issues were handled with expediency and apologies for any inconvenience (which was really minimal). This demonstrates how amazing the staff are here - absolutely nothing is too much trouble and their helpfulness knows no boundaries. Our particular favourite is Chue who is the Director of front of house. This guy went above and beyond by helping with routes for places we wanted to visit, researching Christmas Day restaurants that would be open and researching gluten free eateries for me, to name just a few. Coming back to the hotel and being greeted by him made it feel like home for the duration of our stay :-) so if you want a hotel at a reasonable price, within walking distance to the main strip of Waikiki, where the rooms have a kitchenette (which is really helpful with Waikiki prices to help keep costs down) and the beds are clean and comfortable AND you get free (great) wifi (a definite hit with the kids!) then the Ambassador is definitely worth a stay!

They give you refillable water bottles when you check in to fill at a station in the lobby because i guess the water in the hotel isn't safe to drink.

Many of the other guests were Japanese and very polite which further enhanced the experience (now I want to visit Japan and other countries in Pacific area !). The room was good but not over done. Everything worked well and the a/c though a little noisy provided good service. Having a small kitchen area was very nice and worked well -- fridge, range, sink etc. Dont ask for balcony (upgrade), there is no outside furnishings such as a chair and the hotel's site situation gives views of mostly other concrete hotels and businesses. Plus the noise --- despite usual city noise, the room was very quiet when the balcony door was closed and even later in the night when the balcony door was open. The hotel is conveniently located -- immediately outside is a kiosk that serves convenient, quick and good food for breakfast and lunch and in between. The service is fast and young people running the business are polite and energetic. Good choices of drinks and coffee -- Kona coffee and very reasonable prices for everything. Also at the corner, next to the kiosk is a convenience store and another convenience store around the corner . Prices are quite reasonable, not the high prices I expected. The convenience stores close about midnight and the kiosk about 6pm. About 100 plus feet away from the hotel and across the street is a large park (approximately a city block plus size). You can walk thru the park to get to the beaches and strip of upgrade hotels i.e. the Hilton, the military Hale Kai, etc. So the Ambassador Hotel is a short walk to the beach areas, seemingly most beaches are behind the hotel areas. I only went to beach once and had friends at the Hale Koa so used that beach area. The hotel is also close to the shopping areas, only a few blocks away -- and close to the Trump Hotel (yep, there is one there too). Also, tour buses pick up is at a close by hotel (across the street around the corner, 1 minute walk !). The hotel's parking area seemed too small to accommodate large tour buses but airport pick-up and deliveries were seemingly often. Navigating through the hotel areas to get to the beaches should not be a problem but could be a challenge. (Ask a young surfer or hotel employee for a public entrance to the beach areas). Sorry, am not much of a beach person anymore.The hotel staff is there to serve you 24/7 and they were very helpful. So the Ambassador has good location, conveniences, friendly staff and clean rooms with all the comforts/amenities and give attention to security.

Everything looks very old and outdated, and the room and washroom itself looked pretty grimy. The air conditioning was broken in our room and we had to sleep in the heat that night. My brother had gone to complain the next day and they said they would send someone to come and fix it, but no one did. We complained a second time and not until our last night there did the air conditioning get fixed. The staff was accommodating with our questions for places to eat and even called a cab for us the morning we left for the airport. Based on our experience at this hotel, we will definitely not be coming back here.","Vancouver, Canada","mlaur28</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,1.0

When I finally got the attention of the woman (who spoke terrible Japanese) she was nothing short of rude and dismissive, almost throwing my credit card back at me.Also, there is a hidden $20 ""resort fee"" per night per guest. This would be fine if it gave you access to things that mattered, but instead you get to use their game room (pointless), rent a bike for 2 hours (pointless), etc. Also if you want wifi access in your room you need to pay this. The Wifi is a joke though because it only allows one device to connect at a time so I couldn't connect with my laptop and phone which was a bit ridiculous if I'm paying $20 extra.There was also another woman at some desk over in the corner who was Japanese and would yell Japanese phrases at anyone Asian who walked in, even if they were clearly speaking English. The woman also spoke extremely casual Japanese to Japanese guests which shocked me and some others.Anyway I ignored these warning signs and went to my room. My room was in this dark corridor which freaked me out. But it was only later that I realized that this place was a disaster when I noticed the paint peeling everywhere, the dirty walls and handles on the cabinets, and the clearly unvacuumed floor.I tried to iron a shirt, only to find the iron was attached to the board, I had to drag the whole thing into the bathroom to fill it up with water. Also it was next to impossible to use due to the approximately 1-foot cord that it was held in place by.The bathroom itself was disgusting -- hair all over the place and scum on the walls.The lanai has no furniture so it's utterly pointless.The cherry on the cake was that I found at least 5 or 6 cockroaches during a two-day stay. Awful.Location is pretty good but it's at the beginning of the Waikiki strip, so you have to walk a ways to get where you're going usually. Conversely it makes walking to Ala Moana doable. I hope the staff cuts the useless stuff like ghetto game rooms and bikes with time limits that inhibit anyone from actually using them and use that extra $20 to get someone who can clean properly.","Tokyo, Japan","Amber L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",11,1.0

After a failed reservation at another hotel , we opted to go to stay at the Ambassador Hotel in Waikiki. Upon our arrival , we were greeted by a very friendly set of front desk staff members that were gracious enough to allow us to check in a full hour early. Checking in was rather quick and easy and took no more than 5 to 10 minutes total. We were given an overview of the amenities at the hotel, which include a pool, a laundry room, a gym, a business center and a game room. Once in our room, I was a little surprised at the size of it. There were two full size beds in our room and we were staying on the second floor. From our balcony, we could see the entrance to the lobby into the parking lot below.The hotel is conveniently located about a two and a half to three block walk from Waikiki Beach and many shops and restaurants. Downstairs, outside of the lobby is a convenience store that came in handy plenty of times when we did not feel like going out for breakfast. On our first day there , we rented bikes from the front desk which is a courtesy service provided by the hotel. We rented the bikes for two hours and were not charged a late fee when we brought them back 6 minutes late which I appreciated. They also offer free Wi-Fi for each guest room.This place was great as it was just my 11 year old son and I but I would definitely recommend it for families with several members in their party. The beds were comfortable and the tv offers basic cable which provided some evening entertainment for my son and I after a long day out in the sun and at the beach. We didn't do any cooking but the kitchenette they have definitely would come in handy for anyone who plans to. We did use the refrigerator to store things. There is also a microwave available for use. It was rather cool that they also provide a set of dishes for anyone who may need to use them.All in all, I think that the Ambassador Hotel is a great hotel especially for the price and I would definitely stay there again and most likely will when I return to Waikiki.Aloha!","Oakland, California","CocoaFlwr82</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",4,4.0

However, upon arriving at the hotel, we were faced with even more charges ($20 per night per room just to use the wifi and swimming pool!!!!, and $25 a night to park your car!!!!). Then we went to drop our luggage off in our rooms before doing some sightseeing - what we were faced with were extremely dated looking rooms, tiles falling off the shower and grim looking walls and corridors. Safe to say they looked nothing like the photos on booking.com and the price definitely didn't reflect the quality and standard of the rooms.

Although there's a balcony there's no furniture to sit out there and enjoy the view and weather. The beds we uncomfortable but I had read this already so had no expectations. They give you basic cooking utensils which is good, but nothing else (no coffee, washing detergent, salt, pepper etc) so if staying in a kitchen room expect to go out and buy your basics. Theres no clothes airer in the room so you have no choice but to use the hotel dryer. Parking for guests is cheap at US$25 a night which was good. And the baby cot was for free where most hotels charge per night.The staff are friendly, always giving a smile when passing you. Maintenance are prompt when called, our microwave stopped working in the second day and it was replaced immediately, our tv also stopped working and they came straight away to fix it. During our stay 2 out of 3 washing machines were out of order which was frustrating but by the next day they were fixed.Based on the above I would of given the hotel a 2.5. If I could, I would of given a 0, reason being is on our 3rd day our 11 month old found a pill under the bed near the leg. This is unacceptable! We went straight to reception who told us the room would be cleaned from top to bottom that day, (they also waived 3 days of the amenities fee). It wasn't it was given a basic vac like every other day. This is very concerning as the rooms are obviously not cleaned very well in between guests. We spoke to reception again and was told they would speak to housekeeping to get the room cleaned properly. It wasn't.

This hotel is not the worst I have stayed in by far. In the end, I look at all hotels as a place to sleep. It is outdated and could use a little polishing up. It wasn't dirty, but had an ""old"" smell to it. One of the beds looked as though the sheets/covers weren't changed out (or washed properly), but that was minor. The staff was very friendly and responded quickly when we asked for another pillow. The beds were comfortable to me and my family. The AC window unit was working properly and kept the room as cool as we needed it, albeit the last 2 nights of our stay the temperature was actually in the 60's. I am not a fan of the seemingly popular daily fees (WiFi, gym, etc.) that hotels are pushing onto everybody these days, and of course parking is a premium on this island, thus a daily parking fee was charged. So adding $45/day (plus tax) is something to consider when budgeting your lodging expenses. It is within walking distance of many stores and restaurants, so that is indeed a plus. Overall not a bad place to stay, and if asked if I would recommend to a friend or if I would stay there again, I would definitely say ""Yes, but....."" So as with all hotels, consider your expectations and if they are not ""sky high"" and you are not expecting high end luxury, then consider the Ambassador.","Houston, Texas","Mikeytex</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",0,3.0

Their purified water station was awesome...no need to keep buying bottled water. Their business center was great as we needed to print out documents and I could print my boarding passes as well. Had no problem with the WIFI at all. They give you codes for up to 3 devices per room. The 2 concierge we met were extremely helpful and helped us to get to know our way around. VERY centrally located...walking distance to almost everywhere...and right on the bus lines. convenience store adjacent as well as an ABC convenience store one block up. I saved the best for last...the staff. They were so totally customer service oriented...made you feel like you were home and helped with any and everything with a smile. I needed to leave before my daughter was able to move in to an apartment and they helped me to arrange a last minute 2 day extension ensuring my daughter would not need to leave our current room. I have NEVER took the time to do a review on a hotel on-line...but we had such a great experience I felt the need to share as some of the negative reviews we NEVER experienced and wanted to share. Hope to go back again this year, once my daughter is settled and do a REAL Hawaii vacation...2 weeks....and will look to book at the ambassador.","Gloucester, Massachusetts","Carol S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gloucester, Massachusetts</strong>",3,4.0

This is a good basic hotel. Yes, it is dated; yes, the decor and furnishings are older, but we found this hotel to be clean, there was not one bug in sight - which is amazing given you are staying in Hawaii! I've stayed at luxury hotels in Hawaii that cost 4X this and had daily battles with bugs - NOT here, it was older and a few things are chipped and peeling, but it was DEFINITELY CLEAN! We stayed in Room 629 which overlooks the side street off Kuhio and the hotel's back parking lot; from the balcony's vantage point you can see the sunset and fireworks down by the Rainbow Hilton next to Fort DeRussy. We found there was some street noise but it is minimal; the room had 2 twin beds & 1 double bed. The room was a corner unit with a wrap-around balcony. There is an in-room safe. We moved the table and chairs onto the patio to dine outside then moved them back inside when we were finished. The trade winds really blow strong here which is presumably why they have no patio furniture. The room is across the street from the Waikiki Baptist Church; birds singing in plumeria trees, and overlooks Fort DeRussy. There is a lovely pool on the 3rd floor which is a good size and clean; there are lots of chaise loungers and table/chair units with beach umbrellas. Beach/pool towels are available on the 2nd floor; complimentary filtered water available is the lobby and they provide a complimentary reusable water containers for each person. As our unit had a kitchen we brought our French press for morning coffee (no coffee maker, but there is a kettle, toaster, microwave, stove, fridge and basic utensils, frying pan and 2 pots). There is a wide-screen TV and clock radio. There is no tub but the shower was great - good water pressure and clean. We used the business centre for access to a computer as we left all technology at home. Parking is available but we never had a car and had no need of it (there is a fee); the hotel is at the beginning of Waikiki and we walked everywhere. It's about an 8-minute walk through Fort DeRussy to the beach and about a 30 minute walk down Kuhio to The Zoo. We walked all over Waikiki and had a great time! We took the city Bus ($2.50 each way pp) to Hanauma Bay for snorkeling; the staff at The Ambassador are wonderful, very helpful and informative. There is a Food Pantry a few blocks away for purchasing groceries and if you need a car there is a rental agency (with lovely sports cars!) 1/2 a block away. The beds in this unit were comfortable. If you are looking for a basic hotel this is a good place to stay; its not fancy but we found it to be clean. The housekeeping staff were efficient and such lovely people - our beds were made-up daily, and clean unlimited towels stocked - one day I left a few dishes rinsed in the sink only to return a few hours later and to find them washed! We made breakfast in our unit, and several other meals as well, so we could splurge on a few special nights out. You can get around Waikiki easily either by walking or taking the bus - we walked because its good exercise and very do-able. We walked from one end to the other, as far as the Aquarium down towards Diamond Head, and the other direction to Honolulu's Ward Center past the Ala Moana Shopping Center. We're both in our mid to late 50s and enjoyed our stay. If we came back to Waikiki we would stay at The Ambassador Hotel again. There is a little coffee shop open in the day-time just outside the hotel lobby; they make great ice blended coffee drinks there for a treat and a General store next to it, and an ABC store 1 block in either direction of the hotel (but for groceries go a few more blocks (10 min walk) to Food Pantry on Hobron). Concerning the $20.00 per night amenities charge, just know that it exists, and every hotel in Waikiki charges it, so don't feel like it's different anywhere else.","Victoria, Canada","7HulaGirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",3,3.0

Yes, the hotel is old and in need of some serious updating, and if you are looking for a resort environment this is not it. The guest pictures showing peeling paint are real. However, the staff goes to great lengths to keep the place clean and the service is exemplar. At a time when hotels in Waikiki were charging over $800 (yes, PER NIGHT), the Ambassador was at slightly over $200, after taxes and fees. One irritating thing that most hotels seem to be doing these days is their ""resort fees"" Why oh why if I cannot opt out of these fees they are charged separately? It is nothing but a silly backhanded ploy to make the price seem cheaper when compared side-by-side. The good thing is that since everybody seems to be doing it, the price comparison is back to reality. Still, this practice smacks of dishonesty.All in all, I recommend the hotel.

The photos and ""blurb"" on the hotel's website, indicate something somewhat different from reality. True, the accommodation cost is less than many of the other properties in Waikiki, so if a tight budget is the issue you could consider this hotel. On first impressions the building itself is quite bland - all a dark beige and no other colours. The hotel lobby is quite ordinary, but the front office staff are very pleasant and welcoming. I'd booked a ""partial ocean view room"" and after receiving an email offering a ""higher floor"" upgrade for an extra $US10, opted for that. Getting off on the 16th floor, I was quite looking forward to the view as I walked along the walkway - but opening the door to my room, I found NO ocean view at all - just the blocks of apartments and hotels across the road. I went out on the balcony - which had no outdoor furniture on it ( except a leaking air conditioner) and leant over. Yes, THERE was the water, but leaning out over a balcony 16 floors up isn't all that relaxing.....or healthy.The room was big enough, but bland. The bathroom too was big enough, but a bit shabby, with paint peeling off the wall near the sink. I found out later that the shower drain wasn't all that good either - as the water level rose over my feet ! There was a kitchenette in the room, the TV was fine and the internet wi-fi quite good. As indicated by other reviewers, there is no on-site restaurant or café, so you have to go out for any meals, including breakfast. The hotel is not too far away from places to go, so no big deal.I suppose the most irksome thing is that the hotel calls itself a ""resort"". You get handed a letter at check-in telling you that you will be paying US$20 per room, per night, as a ""Resort Fee"". This hotel is, by NO stretch of the imagination, a ""resort"". For your extra money, amongst other things you can actually have a swim in the pool, hire a push-bike, get given a 5c plastic water bladder and use your in-room safe. What a joke.Rather than hit people up for this ludicrous ""resort fee"", just put it on the room cost in the first place. It may save some annoyance on the part of the guest - who gets hit with the original room rate, plus the alleged ""higher floor"" fee, then the transient accommodation fee and a general excise tax !! Oh yes, before I forget, if you are going to offer rooms with an ocean view ( partial or otherwise) it would be nice to actually deliver on the advertising.","Sydney, Australia","HS300</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",144,3.0

I was aware from Travelocity of the daily parking fee and resort fee so no issue there, unlike some of the bad reviews I saw where people weren't aware. Don't fall for any bad reviews and judge it off of that. Is it a brand new hotel? No, but who is spending their time in Hawaii in the room? The time I did spend in the room was pretty comfortable. In my opinion it was Excellent as the review I'm giving it! I stayed on the 18th floor and had no problems at all.

If you are just looking for a stable base in Waikiki, at a reasonable rate, the Ambassador will do fine. Everything works, including the cable and the wifi. The rooms are spacious, if a bit bland. The staff were, without exception, friendly and helpful. The location is good for shopping, business and exploring the island. Wouldn't recommend it so much for a beach vacation though. There is no restaurant in the hotel, but plenty of coffee shops and restaurants nearby.The biggest minus, apart from the general blandness, is the $20 daily ""Resort Fee"" which will be charged on top of the room rate, upon check out. I find it rather disingenuous to be forced to pay for the pool and other standard amenities, whether you use them or not. My friends tell me though that this little gimmick is not unique to the Ambassador.Just don't expect any tropical paradise atmosphere.","Chiang Mai, Thailand","MarkHKT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chiang Mai, Thailand</strong>",41,3.0

This is not a brand new property by any means built in the 1960's I would guess, there was some wear and tear evident in our room, a fresh coat of paint would have helped and perhaps some newer furnishings. However, the room was clean, the beds were comfortable, we got a little kitchenette which was very handy and the A/C unit appeared new and worked well which was a good thing as it was in the 90's with 90% humidity when we were there. Parking was $25 a night which I guess is pretty standard for the area. There was also a $20 a night ""amenity"" fee which we knew about up front. The only ""amenity"" we really used was the internet so it would be nice if they had some variable fee depending on the ""amenities"" used but perhaps this is being nitpicky. The staff was very nice and housekeeping did an excellent job. While several blocks away from the beach it was pretty close to all the action in Waikiki from a shopping and dining standpoint.

The balconies are not much, but they do mean you can have fresh air and look out to the ocean. The two double beds were pretty comfortable and having a full kitchen helped save money on buying food. The bathroom is definitely only 3 star, with a tiny shower recess and single sink (no vanity or bench top). On the up side, the water pressure was good (girls with long/thick hair will love it for washing out conditioner) and the room itself is large enough to dress in, with the full length mirrored double closet located in the bathroom. There are only three lifts in the entire complex, so give yourself extra time to get down to the lobby. You are not allowed to use the stairs.The wi-fi is good and free. They give you access codes for up to 3 devices when you check in, but were happy to provide an extra cope when requested. I was a bit disapointed that for the daily 'resort fee', the pool (that is tiny) was only open from 10am to 6pm daily and there is no spa. They do, however, provide free beach towels and bike rentals.There are only three machines in the guest laundry, and being a budget friendly hotel, they are in constant use.I have to say the staff were very friendly and helpful. The location is very good for the price and if you are not up for a short walk to most locations, there is a bus stop right outside the hotel. If going to the beach, I'd suggest walking through Fort Derussy park. The beach there is excellent and not as packed as closer to the big resorts.

This was our first ever visit to The Ambassador Hotel. We always thought because of it's age, it would be subpar, but we were wrong. Here's my breakdown:Reservation: Excellent on-line reservation system. Most websites pictures makes the hotel rooms look better then they really are. This website was not as bad. 5 StarsCheck-in: You have to park in loading zone stalls (I think there were 5) which are occassionally blocked by tour mini-busses or taxi cabs, You walk in, check in, then use the gate card they provide to go into hotel's parking. Remember to take in you car information- Make/Model and license number. When checking in there is no clear place to stand in line, and check in stations are spread out, so stay alert for when you are next. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. 4 starsElevator/security: you need your room key to get into elevator. semi-secured, although anyone waiting for elevator door to open can still walk in and go to any room in hotel. 4 starsRoom: The room we had included a full kitchen. The bathroom was very roomy, lighting good, a/c good. When you turn off the a/c you can hear the traffic outside. tv service good, but screen kind of small. wifi enabled rooms were a plus. The rooms show their age, but they did an excellent job in keeping it clean, and kind of updated. 4 starsAmmenities: Room service consist of a paid vendor who will pick up and deliver food to you from various restaurants in Honolulu. delivery price is fair, but menu book looks dated, so am not sure on prices of food, and establishments. Hotel gym is great, be sure to wear your shoes. They give you a very inexpensive water bottle to fill up in lobby, around the corner.outside of lobby, Whalers General store-overpriced but when you want/need it, you'll pay. They also have a coffee shop right outside door.Check-out: Before checking out, remove car from parking lot, and park in loading zone, then go and check out. You have to return parking gate pass so you will get locked in if you don't do this. Check out process was simple and easy.Location: located right in the beginning of Waikiki, so very easy to get in and out. I rate it better then the hotel across the street, but very slightly higher in price.","Kealakekua, Hawaii","Mitch T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kealakekua, Hawaii</strong>",39,4.0

My brother and I hardly slept last night. We could hear the ding of the elevator every time someone cane up or down. Seriously its a quiet bell, but every time.. Ding! And every word spoken in the hall was clearly audible. Sirens all night! The air conditioner is louder than most planes (did cool off the room) but you'd rather have it on to drown out the other noises. We heard last night that the hotel was fully booked, so we don't have a hope of swapping rooms. But I doubt it would be any different on any other floor. The staff were very friendly(good aloha spirit), that's the only plus. Considering eating the cost and switching hotels. Never staying here again. ",,Katie P,1,2.0

The rooms are clean. They look a bit outdated but so what. I had internet access plugged right into my laptop. The view from either side of the hotel is nice - ocean, canal or mountains. There's a pool if you want that and some other simple amenities. The location is key. Right in the heart of Waikiki - you can walk everywhere. The reality is, who spends all their time in the hotel anyway? I was only there to sleep and shower. The desk staff was helpful when I needed information. The price was just right. The only bad thing about this hotel is lack of access to the stairwell. I HATE elevators and was forced to endure it everyday. They keep the stairwell locked. I understand the safety concerns but there should be some way that someone who doesn't want to take the elevator can access the stairs.",San Jose,"Lisa95125</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose</strong>",3,4.0

The last stay was a bit different, and that was probably the last time. What I like about the hotel is the location, at the eastern part of Waikiki that is near everything, to include parking at FT Derussy, and a centralized location that allows for easy access into and out of Waikiki. The 2d part is the hotel front desk staff, which really are as good as some as some of the reviews mention. When you have a great staff, you can overcome many of the smaller problems and make for a great stay when folks are so super friendly. The outside walkways give great views of the sunset and also of the rainbows towards the mountains.The downside of my stay was I had a room was sharing with bugs and did not start seeing them till part way through the stay. I had no food in the place, so why they arrived I do not know. I identified the problem to the reception desk, had it checked out, and the room was supposed to have gotten sprayed. Because it was the next to last day, did not see need to change rooms, but should have, since problem was still there the last night. I misunderstood the compensation that was offered, which had thought to be different than what was given. If you decide to stay on the strengths of what the hotel offers - just make sure you request a room change if the same problem occurs.","Tampa, Florida","aieaairborne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",17,2.0

Our night at Ambassador was only $99 US dollars from Agoda (what a bargain for Waikiki). The check in area was busy and the Manager kept apologising for the hold up, which impressed me right of the bat. We checked in and got given 2 free water bottles for the free water fountain and 2 access codes for free Wi-Fi. The manager was more than happy to give us a map and point out the areas we wanted to see. The room was clean and no I did not see chipping paint or cracked furniture. The carpets were clean, the bathrooms were clean and if I wasn't going on cruise the next day, easy could of stayed a week. The only thing that took the time to wait is the lift, cause its an older hotel than most and to be expected. But we were so high up, I just watched the waves on the beach, so it was no hassle for me. Yes the trucks in the morning are loud and busy, but Waikiki is early to bed, early to rise. I was already awake by 6am so I wasn't affected. It was very quiet at night in our room, so I was happy. The only issue I would point out is the air conditioner can be a little noisy and that's cause again, older hotel so no ducted air conditioning, I can forgive that, but it did keep our room nice and cool.The only grip I would say is the balcony could do with some furniture for sitting as its a great view of the city at night, but this is the only tiny grip I have. The man who hailed us a cab and helped us with directions in the lobby was so nice and friendly that we ended up tipping him $20 for his great service. He deserved it, he didn't act friendly and nice for a tip and we had some great laughs with him. The pool area was so nice and had no issues using hotel towels. I don't know why so many complaints about this hotel. The staff were friendly and accommodating, yes it's a little older hotel but its not a dump and I've been to a lot of hotels in my travels.

Karla the Guest Services manager checked us in super cheerfully and had already pre-assigned rooms on the same floor. We were able to get in a couple hours early too, which was much appreciated with two tired parents, two crazy kids, and two very tired grandparents. Everyone we encountered. including housekeeping, was very friendly. The activities concierge is ultra-helpful for information and trip planning. Definitely stop by to chat. They can also recommend and book tours and shuttles --most pick up right at the doorstep of the hotel. At checkout we discovered the kids (or maybe grandma and grandpa) had accidentally purchased some pay movies (childrens' movies, thank god) The front desk was great and removed the charges for the ones under a minute or so long...but there was a show they watched for 15+ minutes so of course we ponied up. Dang kids.My family booked a kitchenette category which includes mini-fridge, microwave, stovetop, toaster, all kitchen utensils and dishware. There may be other small appliances available by request (rice cooker). Keep in mind that Waikiki is incredibly limited for kitchenette/full kitchen types. You'll be hard pressed to even find an in-room microwave.Bathroom is spacious, with walk-in shower only. I don't think any of the units have bathtubs. Self parking is $25, on the cheaper side for Waikiki.We never visited the pool!The location is good-- for anyone that can walk reasonably. Waikiki is only 1.5 miles long so its very easy to get to beach, food, shopping, groceries. However, this place is on the outer fringes: since Grandma and Grandpa can't go more than a half mile without resting, even the quarter mile walk to Ihop was rough. The half-mile to the beach? They said forget it! Downstairs is a well stocked convenience store, and a Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf kiosk. The nearest eatery would be right across the street: Vit's Hawaiian Steakhouse which has good breakfast and reasonably priced dinner. There is also Protea Café at the Luana hotel for fantastic breakfasts/coffee/smoothies-- lunch is just OK. All other shopping and dining will begin 5-10 minutes walking. The nearest full service grocery store, Food Pantry is a mile away.The rooms are clean, linens are fresh. However the furniture, paint, cabinetry, flooring, are old and chipped, scratched, rusty, out of alignment. Completely functional but run-down! Sorry Ambassador, needs some work! I'll have to be honest: for kitchenettes or full kitchen accommodations, I'd have to recommend the Luana Waikiki across the street. Its clean, semi-modern Hawaiian style with wood flooring and granite countertops, nice amenities. Price may be a bit more per night depending on the season, but worth the cost. They're a solid four dot hotel. Alternatively, the Ohana West and Ohana Malia are good choices if Luana is too expensive: They have some kitchenette rooms, and facilities are slightly more updated than the Ambassador. They are also more convenient to shops and dining, but in turn have limited options for view category rooms. Keep in mind that noise is a hot issue as you get closer to city center.Bottom line: the Ambassador is a great place for super budget travelers. Families who book a kitchenette and are willing to prepare meals will definitely find the best value here. You get good service and a clean, functional room. This place will be quieter than almost all other hotels, even in the lower category. If the Ambassador ever goes through a renovation and remains reasonably priced, I'd definitely be back to check it out. A helpful tip: ALWAYS book directly with the hotel and check for specials, or if you book through a third party make extra-sure of all your options! My family booked a package through JTB which forced the group of four adults and two kids to purchase three partial ocean view kitchenette rooms. They didn't need a third room to begin with, and definitely didn't need all three to be kitchenette types.","Honolulu, Hawaii","DisgracedPuppy7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",26,3.0

Messed up on the dates and was not able to change it due to their cancellation policy. Which is horrible...you still pay full price to change/cancel your reservation. So basically I had to add on another day so I wouldn't lose out on $. There is a $25/day parking fee & $20 wifi (amenities) fee. Which the lady didn't even tell me about and just asked if we needed wifi. The room is liveable but not pleasant looking. Had a kitchenette with a rusty looking fridge. Shower was gross, didn't even drain well. Patches on the walls, TV is so small and reception for it was garbage. I've been in hotels that were the same price as this and had way better accommodations. They don't even have towels by the pool and they claim the pool has toys for use..all they had was broken noodles floating around.

I was in the wing behind the main hotel. The room was run down and with the walls all cinder block, looked like a prison. But the cinder block walls are soundproof so the room was very quiet. This is an older hotel that caters to tour groups of Japanese tourists. It is very basic-BUT it is less expensive than other Waikiki hotels which is why I stayed there. The room had a lanai but no chairs which I remedied by moving a chair outside from the room. The bed was clean and comfortable and the wifi worked great. Please note that there is wi fi in each room which was not the case a year ago so ignore what you read in older posts. Unlike most hotels which allow only one device on their wifi , this hotel allowed at least two so I could access with both my Ipad and Iphone.Parking is $25 a night but I booked a room where parking was included for $20 a night. Parking spaces seemed sufficient. Note there is a parking garage across the street attached to a hotel that had a sign advertising parking for $7 a day. However, I have no idea if that included overnight or in and out privileges but if you have time is worth checking out.There is a coffee hut right outside the front door. Also, right around the corner is a Whalers General Store with all kinds of drinks, yogurt as well as a good variety of fresh sandwiches.

First off, the booking was prepaid on Expedia and we only expected to pay $20 addition resort fee when we checked in as specified at time of booking. Little did we know that they would attempt to extort $30 more dollars for us having our 13 year old boy with us. Even though we had booked the reservation for two adults and one child prepaid to Expedia. They then told us that parking anywhere else would result in our car being towed so we have to pay $25 more for parking. A street just blocks away was free for the weekend and across the street the parking was $18. The staff was rude and difficult and when I showed the confirmed reservation receipt printed out, they didn't want to look at it and insisted their policy was their policy. The property itself was dark and dreary and felt more like low income housing over a resort...still not sure what the fees were for. All exits were locked shut and there was no way out except the front door...not safe in the event of an emergency. I would not stay at this hotel again if it were free.

The Hotel has a pool with loungers and umbrella's and was fine for a couple of afternoons rest. This hotel is ideal for anywhere you want to go to. Very near the beach, through Fort Derussey Park. 5 minutes to eating places. Try IHOP for breakfast. $8.95 for a breakfast and a stack of pancakes. Coffee is extra but cheap and they give you a flask on the table full of it. It's good for other meals too. Prices are not expensive compared to England. The same or less. We took too much spending money. Hard Rock Cafe has a happy hour after 10.00 at night. Cocktails $5 and A pint of beer $4 and a live band. Try Arnold's beach bar beside Eggs and Things. Cheap drinks all day. Mai Tai's are lovely and strong. It's down a side alley and looks a bit grim but locals seem to drink there. Honolulu zoo is within walking distance and really nice. Beware the bugs though it's the only place I got bitten. The Ambassador is a lovely place to stay when you'd rather stay down budget and keep the money you save on not having all the frills to spend on other things, Give it a try. I'm pleased we did.","Coxhoe, United Kingdom","mandyegg2k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coxhoe, United Kingdom</strong>",96,5.0

Drinking water is available in the ground floor and laundrynette is in the second floor. An average size pool is in the third floor. Our room was fixed and cleaned daily. Hotel staff were kind and courteous.

I figured any hotel in Waikiki would be decent enough, but I was wrong. Everything in this hotel is old and outdated. I felt like I was staying at a hotel in Mad Men. Let me also state that I only travel a couple times a year and don't stay in that many hotels (besides Vegas). I have also worked in customer service for 10+ years, so I know good service when I get it. The bathroom and shower were terrible. There was only one free standing sink, which I didn't mind since I was traveling alone, but there was zero bathroom counter space. I'm a guy, so I'm low maintenance. I need somewhere to put my toothbrush, toothpaste, and my hair gel. That's it. But with the lack of counter space, I had to use the toilet tank to set my toothbrush and gel, and nearly had a close call dropping my toothbrush into the toilet. I have no idea what a girl would do with this space with makeup and other toiletries.The shower was even worse. It was a stand-up shower with no tub (didn't matter to me), and felt like the tile hadn't been upgraded since the place was built (my guess is 40-50 years ago). Needless to say, I wore my flip flops into the shower. The shower head also sprayed in 30 different directions, which was fun. The worst part of it all, was the front desk customer service. One day (the day of the wedding, of course), I did not have hot water!! WHAT?! I took a cold shower then ran off to the wedding since I was running late, waiting and hoping for hot water to turn on. When I told the front desk about this as I was checking out, she asked me if I called and told them. I had not (my mistake). She said no one else complained about it, so it must have just been my room and I should have called them about it. I told her I was running late and didn't have time to complain so I took a cold shower, then asked if she was going to do anything about it to make it up to me. She responded with ""what do you want me to do about it?"". She never once apologized or showed any empathy towards my situation. I had to ask her to waive a measly $20 parking fee, which she went behind the counter to get ""supervisor approval"". Oh, I almost forgot! The only place in this hotel with WiFi is the hotel lobby! So the lobby was always packed with people sitting and standing around using the WiFi, it was difficult to even walk through sometimes. I found an ethernet cable in my room and called the front desk to see if I could hook up my laptop to it for internet access. The front desk told me that cable is for a modem and not my laptop, so I needed to buy a modem. Stupid me, I didn't even try to hook up my laptop. So I went out and bought a modem and tried hooking it up. It didn't work, so I called the ever-informative front desk. Now, they told me I can hook up my laptop directly to the cable and I don't need a modem. I told her that the last person I spoke with told me I needed a modem, but she didn't care. Between the terrible shower, lack of hot water, poor customer service, and the rock-hard bed and tiny TV (both of which I didn't even mention), I would never stay at this hotel again. It felt like I was staying at a hostel. For the price they charge per night, this hotel is way overpriced for it's amenities, and they don't even attempt to make up for it through their customer service. The only thing decent about this hotel is the location, which earned them 1 star. That and I can't figure out how to give it zero stars.","Los Angeles, California","kai1ne</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",9,1.0
