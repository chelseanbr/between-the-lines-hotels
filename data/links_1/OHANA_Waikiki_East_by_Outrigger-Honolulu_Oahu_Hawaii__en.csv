I used Hotwire to book and got this hotel. I enjoyed my stay and found it to be family friendly (the pool was a huge hit for my kids!), the decor and aesthetic was very Hawaiian, and the walk to the beach was quick! The staff were amazing and went above and beyond to make our short stay memorable. My only gripe is the pushy timeshare people. Even with my youngest having a meltdown the lady wouldn’t stop trying to get me to attend the meeting, spend $ to go, etc. it made me feel uncomfortable leaving the lobby since we had to go past her.","Anchorage, Alaska","meganmichelle907</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",0,4.0

We have stayed at other Outrigger Hotels in the past and have always felt they were a great mid-range hotel. Unfortunately this one needs some serious updating. The rooms were spacious and the bed was comfortable, but the wallpaper was peeling, the grout in the bathroom was dirty, the shower door would not close and the baseboards and trim work were all banged up. We also had reserved a King Room, but upon check in, were told None were available, and also no Queen's. We had no choice but to accept double beds. Not at all happy about that. However, on the upside, the price was reasonable for Waikiki and the location was Fantastic. Very close to all major shopping, eating places and the Beach.

It was clean and the staff were friendly. The room had a minifridge, toaster and microwave so we had breakfast in our room to help to reduce costs.We had a king sized bed which was quite comfortable.From this location it was only a couple of blocks from Waikiki beach and many shops and restaurants. We were moved from our original room as the air conditioner was producing a constant drip of water onto the carpet and we couldn't open our balcony door. The staff was quite accommodating and the move was not difficult.The swimming pool was quite cold (I don't think it was heated) so we didn't use it as much as we would have liked. The hot tub was comfortable. I only gave this hotel 3 stars because of the noisy construction going on next door and across the street. Noise from the construction started most mornings before 7am. I know this is not the fault of our hotel but its something for a visitor to consider if going to Honolulu in the near future. The construction in both locations is just starting so will likely be ongoing for some time.I note that all of the hotels charge an ""ammenity"" fee. The fee for this hotel was $20.00 US per night and charged when you check out of the hotel. I think this fee is underhanded and a hidden fee to make the hotel more money while making their room price appear more reasonable. I would much rather have hotels be upfront about the total cost of a room in their advertised pricing as opposed to adding this fee to the fine print. Be careful when looking into hotels as this fee of $20.00 was one of the lower fees for hotels in the area. This can add quite a cost to your holiday.","Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Canada","27west</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Assiniboia, Saskatchewan, Canada</strong>",2,3.0

Each time we had a great experience. Not only did we get a clean comfortable room with excellent service, but also I believe we got one of the best deals in Waikiki. It helped that we used Hotwire's Mystery Hotel deal. Guessing the hotel is pretty easy by the way. We did use the Gym, beach towels, and the restaurant for breakfast. We also had a balcony for early morning and late evening relaxation. Daytime can be a little hot. The hotel is conveniently located to excellent shopping, public transportation, and of course, the Waikiki Beach. Another perk was the free use of the Pink Line Double Decker tour bus. The staff at the front desk was particularly friendly and extremely helpful. Highly reccomended.","Minto, Canada","tolo565</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minto, Canada</strong>",16,4.0

There was no cool air con working and when we checked out the vents they were black and disgustingly filthy. The room whilst clean (thanks to great housekeeping) is very very old, tired and worn out. What makes it even worse at checkin we were told it was a great room one of the best! I gave feedback to management in survey that I do not think they should be renting the room out at all. The kitchenette is a joke if a family staying here are wanting to cook a lot of meals with only an electric fry pan for cooking (there is a microwave) you would have to cook in batches!The bathroom is functional, shower curtains (who has them in this day and age) actually were doubled and so don’t cling which was a blessing and the detachable shower head was a bonus. Probably the best thing about the whole apartment!The bedroom is a nice size and king bed to boot, as long as you sleep on the window side. Unfortunately I didn’t so I had to contend with a distinct downwards slope to the outside. The sitting room or another bedroom as it has a sofa bed was very large. With it being at the end there were windows on two walls so made for a very sunny filled room - except had to keep the curtains drawn as so hot with no cool air con. The lanai was a nice size and full size table and chairs. But again very old and tattered looking. With no sun shade though, wasn’t pleasant sitting outside for too long. There were lovely views could see the beach and water amongst the hotels closer to the beach.As other reviews say it’s in a great location about 5 mins walk to the beach and about 2 mins walk to the International Market. Plenty of cafes & restaurants - we found a great one called Basalt checkout the cocktail Cool Burn! The cafe in the hotel serves good coffee (which is quite hard to find in Hawaii).Whilst I would never ever return to this hotel unless it was seriously remodeled or even demolished and rebuilt, I would like to call out Housekeeping for Level 18 - they were very friendly and honest.We moved to other accommodation after 4 nights. I am so grateful we only had to stay here for a family event for 4 nights because if this had been my introduction to Hawaiian hotel accommodation I would have returned home with a sour taste in my mouth.Other family members stayed in suite 1923 (marginally better air con working) and Room 928 which had amazing cool aircon. We just drew the short straw but didn’t let it spoil our holiday.Floors 18 and 19 are serviced by an express elevator which unfortunately is being upgraded so we rode the service elevator very classy not! But got to meet the delightful staff who were all very pleasant and welcoming - even when the elevator stank of rubbish Please, if this doesn’t put you off staying here enjoy your stay and I hope you get a nice cool room .","Karekare, New Zealand","blankie47</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Karekare, New Zealand</strong>",4,1.0

The next morning we went to the front desk to ask about upgrading our room. There was nothing wrong with the room we were in it was just close to the elevator and my husband is a very light sleeper.

But for this trip, I decided to walk away from the lavish resort amenities and chose to stay at a budget friendly hotel. After researching online, I was lucky to find a hotel with a great location in Waikiki and, a nightly rate plus amenities that's exclusively offered to kama'ainas or Hawai'i residents like myself. The Ohana East Hotel by Outrigger, located on the corner of Kai'ulani and Kuhio Avenue in Waikiki. I'm very familiar with the Outrigger Enterprises Group, a hotel management company that was started in Hawai'i 72 years ago by Mr. Roy Kelley, who had a vision to offer family-friendly hotel rooms in Waikiki. Through the company's Ke Ano Wa'a program, a cultural enriching program that starts with educating and investing into the team members first, then into the hotel property design, this unique style of perpetuating the rich culture of the Hawaiian islands then embraces each guest during their stay. Through the years, the company's portfolio has grown to include properties outside of Hawai'i along with brands such as Ohana by Outrigger. I arrived by airport shuttle, curbside in front of the hotel was busy with other vehicles. The bellman welcomed me with a warm greeting and gave me directions to the front desk to check in, as I rode the escalator to the first floor. A small, yet decorated air conditioned lobby boasted a full-scale outrigger canoe for observation, colorful carpet and art hanging from the walls and, comfortable chairs with cushions as hotel guests moved about or relaxed. I walked to the front desk where I was embraced with a smile and warm greeting. Although I had arrived earlier than the check-in time, the front desk agent was nice enough to assign me to a room that was available and before I knew it, I was unpacking in my hotel room. The hotel room, basic yet clean with well appointed furnishings. No bathtub but with a shower, the room also came with ample amounts of closet space, a refrigerator, coffee maker, in-room safe, flat screen TV and a table with two chairs. Daily housekeeping kept our hotel room clean and I made sure to leave a gratuity daily even though I was staying at a budget friendly hotel. Beach/pool towels were in the hotel room, changed daily if used. Part of the amenities offered with the special nightly rate for Hawai'i residents included a Ohana Hotels drawstring bag, two complimentary Mai Tai's, a coupon booklet, complimentary parking and complimentary rides on the Pink Line throughout Waikiki and to Ala Moana Center. The Pink Line, operated by another Hawai'i company, E Noa Tours, is a double-decker bus that travels into Waikiki with multiple stops and to the Ala Moana Center, with over 350 stores and restaurants. Riding the Pink Line was so convenient and fun, as I sat on the top of the two-story bus and enjoyed the views and cool breeze. The location of the hotel is also extremely convenient, just steps from the beach and located in the ""heart of Waikiki"", where in less than five minutes walking distance, I could be at the International Marketplace or the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center. Because the hotel is not located on a side street away from the traffic and crowds, it's safe to venture off-property in all directions when leaving the property. When I wasn't eating or shopping, or just cruising around Waikiki, I enjoyed the jacuzzi and pool at the hotel. Although the pool was not as elaborate like other resort properties in Waikiki, the hotel pool had a decent amount of lounge chairs where I was able to sunbathe and, having a jacuzzi to relax in was a great way to unwind after a day full of walking.If you're a Hawai'i resident and are searching for a hotel property that offers a great location with convenience, a clean hotel room with great amenities, affordable nightly rates if purchased at the time reserved with no cancellation and, a property with a team who genuinely cares about your stay, I would recommend the Ohana East Hotel by Outrigger. And, if you're not a kama'aina, I would still recommend this hotel property if you're traveling from outside of Hawai'i to Waikiki. It's a simple hotel, non-fussy with small amenities offered yet, the Ohana East Hotel by Outrigger extends a great location with great value.",United States,"JtD808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",9,4.0

The room was clean and they provided beach/pool towels, there was a coffee and tea maker, fridge and in room safe, but no microwave or toaster ( I know some of the other hotels in the area provide these). There was a $25 resort fee on top of the room rate which covers internet, and free travel on the pink line to Ala Moana shopping centre. I think most of the hotels charge this which I think is ridiculous as the room rate is already high enough and we had a hire car which we had to pay another $25 a day for parking. The rooms are comfortable enough and the kids enjoyed eating their cereal breakfast on the small balcony, and liked going to the pool/spa after a day at the beach. If you are not planning to hire a car then this hotel would be fine as you have every thing close by and can pay for tours, but if you want to explore on your own I would probably find a hotel that includes either parking or breakfast for better value for money.","Perth, Western Australia, Australia","Deouin L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Western Australia, Australia</strong>",3,3.0

We arrived on a 8-30am flight from Australia arriving at the hotel around 10am.

You can still use the coffee shop, the pool and other facilities.The other thing that disappointed on this occasion was the push for tour desk to sell packages for Wyndham Holiday time share before wanting to help you. This should be an add on.Make sure you request rooms at either end of the building or away from middle pool side. Our room was located next to the 3 lifts and you could hear the movement all night long.Also Come prepared to spend more than you expect when visiting Hawai’i.

The room matched our expectations: it has a living room, bedroom, kitchenette and bathroom. We prefer to have a living room separated from the bedroom when we stay somewhere for a week or longer. The room provides ample storage space. Our room was on the top floor (19th floor) of the building. There is a dedicated elevator serving the top three floors, which goes directly to the lobby and to street level, so we had easy access. The room is decorated in a style and colours which was popular several decades ago, and could use some renewal. However, nothing was broken or damaged, everything worked as intended. The kitchenette is suitable for making coffee and heating up food in the microwave. Don't expect to be able to actually cook a meal. And housekeeping does not clean coffee cups and cutlery: we found out that we had to do that ourselves. Some other reviews talk of noise from neighbouring rooms. We did not experience that, except for one occasion where a baby was audibly crying in the room next-doors. The hotel pool is very small so we didn't bother trying it out.One thing which I did not like is that the hotel room, which you pay for in advance, does not cover the total cost. Several items, such as internet connection, are charged separately and on a daily basis (called ""Daily Resort Charge""). So, upon checking out I had to pay another USD 23 for each day of stay. This Daily Resort Charge increased the total cost of stay by about 10%. This pricing strategy is what ""budget airlines"" do, not ""full service airlines"". It gives me the impression that Outrigger wants to position itself in the ""budget airlines"" category instead of the ""full service airlines"" category.We discovered that Waikiki is actually rather compact and each street, shop or restaurant was easily reachable on foot from the hotel. It does not make much difference which Waikiki hotel you choose: all of them are rather close to each other.Our stay was overshadowed by an incident with the concierge. One day we stopped at the concierge desk, asking for advice about a bus tour around the island. Two men were sitting there. Once we had made our choice and were close to actually booking it, they said that we might be entitled to a discount of up to 50%. From here on it became sketchy. They asked some questions and started to make phone calls. Followed by more phone calls and more questions, which became increasingly more personal (""what is your profession?"", ""your annual income?"", ""your nationality?"", ""need a copy of your photo ID""). This got me really annoyed as we were only discussing a bus tour. Only when I voiced my anger did they disclose that they were setting us up for a promotion tour of Outrigger timesale property. This made me extremely angry, as I was not going to waste time on this and was annoyed that they had already taken so much time from me. I have paid quite some money to stay in this hotel and then I get confronted with such deceitful behaviour of the concierge. I had not expected this. Since that incident have I avoided all hotel staff: if management allows the concierge to behave this way, then they will also allow other customer-facing staff to behave this way. I didn't want to have the risk of being trapped a second time.All in all did the room meet our expectations. The Ohana Waikiki East is a hotel which we will most likely avoid in the future. This was my first stay in an Outrigger property and I must say that the brand has not made a good impression on me. P.S. I gave the same feedback on the hotel's questionnaire after my return home. A manager sent me an email apologizing for the incident. He disclosed to me that one of the two men was the hotel's concierge and the other was a sales representative of the Outrigger timesale company. This was not clear to me when I sat there, as there were no signs indicating this and the men did not disclose this upfront. The manager stopped short of saying whether they will make any changes. I guess not.","Penang Island, Malaysia","NLinTKO</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Penang Island, Malaysia</strong>",38,2.0

Although the view is only slightly of the ocean it is still spectacular and looks over the international market place. At night it is all lit up.Our room was the king room directly behind the lifts. Although the lifts run off and off all night it didnt bother us as we were heavy sleepers. Although you could hear it if you woke up, it never woke me up. The bonus with these rooms are they have 2 seperate closets and larger balcony than the other rooms. This worked great as we were able to get 10 people in the room comfortably for drinks. Whilst at the hotel the lifts were infuriatingly slow however one was done up in the week were there, one was done up before we arrived and the 3rd i imagine is already complete by now. The pool had all new furniture delivered whilst we were there. There is a cafe located down stairs that does great breakfast, croisants, eggs, acai bowls, coffess and knick knacks etc. There is no food service at this hotel but there is a really cute, intimate italian restaurant located down stairs in front of the hotel. The location is excellent. Walking distance to waikiki beach, the Moana surfrider, the international village, Dukes, the cheesecake factory (we got food posioning there, the line up at night is 45-90 minutes after 6pm). And about 5 minutes walk to the Starbucks Reserve (aussies check this place out).We stayed for 7 nights and the dollar changed during the book now pay later and actually paying. When we held the rooms they were $2100 for the 7 nights and when it came time for paying they were $2400.

There was the protesting just next to the hotel but we had a room on the 11th floor so the noise wasn't too bad. We also knew about the protests happening before we arrived in Hawaii and from reading the news, my understanding is that it's over now. This hotel is a bit outdated but compared to other hotels in the area and given it's central location, the price was pretty good. The rooms were a good size, the bed was comfortable but the carpet and furnishings need updating. The staff at the front desk, bellhop and concierge were fantastic. The concierge we spoke with was Adam ( I think) and he was super helpful booking our pearl harbour tour, car hire and luau. The elevators are also being updated at the moment so the middle elevator if you're catching it from the lobby will go down before it goes up. It's annoying but not the end of the world. There's also signage where the elevators are to tell you there is work going on. There is a small gym onsite too which has all the basics. They also provide you a small beach bag with beach towels.This hotel is great if you want to be close to the beach but not right in the hustle and bustle. There's a coffee shop onsite, a convenience store right at the bottom of the escalator and you get free use of the pink line trolley. We liked it because it was affordable, central to everything you need and the staff were great.

The hotel is dated and the room was really small. However, if you're looking for an affordable hotel less than a five minute walk from Canoe/Queens Beach, this place is perfect! I was traveling by myself and couldn't have asked for a better setup for three nights. In addition, everyone on the staff (Angie, Brian and others) were all VERY helpful. When I didn't like my original room on the second floor because it was right next to the service elevator with a view of nothing but the pool, I asked for another room. Despite getting the original room because I'm sure it was assigned to travelers who'd booked on the cheap via Expedia, I was moved to the 16th floor. The staff asked if I didn't mind a room without a balcony, which was fine with me, and I ended up with room 1625 and a panoramic view looking straight out at the ocean! This was room 1625. If you have a choice, try to get a room as high up as possible and ending in -25. Another huge perk was that my flight back home wasn't until 8pm and I knew that I'd have to check out around noon. Besides giving me a later checkout at 2pm so I could get a hike in, and also allowing me to check my bags for the day, when I returned around 6pm, they allowed me to take a shower and clean up in a hospitality room before heading to the airport.
