She had asked her admin to book this hotel from the start, but her admin had gotten confused. It's understandable: there are 3 hotels that are named pretty much the same thing within a 5 mile radius. If you've never been, it can be difficult to muddle through.Anyway, check-in was quick and easy, with everyone from the door staff to the front desk welcoming us in with smiles. Check-in was a breeze, and before we knew it, we were being escorted to our floor and to our rooms.I don't know what I'd expected, but the room wasn't it. Not that it was bad - far from it - but my boss made it sound like this hotel was the THING, and that we just had to stay there. Again, I had no complaints. The shower was mold-free (and had blessedly strong water pressure), the bed was comfortable and clean, and I had a nice view overlooking the grounds (shared with the other Shinagawa hotel across the way).I got better quality sleep here than I did at the other hotel, though that could also be attributed to my body adjusting to the 16 hour time difference.I did hang out in the club chairs early in the morning, while I FaceTimed with my husband back at home, or worked with the San Diego team before they called it a day.If you stay here, and the weather permits, definitely get out and explore their grounds. Like I said, there's a path between this hotel and their sister one across the way (which I think is also connected to a convention center). There's a large Koi pond, a bell and some structures that look old and probably had a good sign explaining their presence or importance that I totally missed.","San Diego, California","SimeyTravels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",203,4.0

The hotel is beautiful, the garden is wonderful, the service first class. But it does not have a convenient store near by or machine that sell us sundry, soda .... for that we have to walk to the 7-11 in Grand Prince Shin Tankanawa (a 8-10 minutes walk but not much fun when it is dark at night and we have to walk through the dark garden path), There is also no microwave available anywhere in the hotel. The hotel do offer 24 hours room service that would run about $40-60 for a meal and several restaurants in the property that cost between $60-120 a meal each person. The only problem is that we paid about $176+tax a night for our room and we are not ready to spend that much money in it’s restaurants. It is middle to upper middle in term of price range for Tokyo hotels but the restaurants are design for clients that spends 5 star money. if you don’t want to spend that much money on a meal, the location of the hotel become a problem, It is on a hill that is about 10-15 minutes walking from Shinagawa station (depending on how fast/slow when you climb the hill walking to the hotel). The hill is between 10-15% grade, walking is not exactly a good solution after a long day of sightseeing. There is a shuttle bus every 20 minutes between the hotel and Shinagawa hotel. The problem is that it serves 3 Prince hotels (Tanagawa, Shin Tanagawa, Sukura Tower). In our 8 days stay, we had 2 occasions that the shuttle bus was too full (only 24 seats) and we were left at Shinagawa station trying to figure out how to go back to the hotel, In one occasion, we took a taxi back to the hotel (about 600 yen’s or $5.5). In the other occasion, we had to walk at night because the taxi line was exceedingly long. I can’t help but think that shuttle bus prole will much more serve in Summer time. Picking Prince hotel Tanagawa is a two edge sword. The room is big (225 sq ft or so), service is great, bell person / front desk spoke very good English, hotel ground is beautiful. Airport bus stop at the airport. The downside is that if you need anything, you need to go to stores around Shinagawa station. Walking up and down the hill is not fun nor practical for travelers new to Japan if the shuttle bus is full. Using taxi at some point should be part of the plan. Hotel restaurants are meant for clients with much more expensive taste (and they already booked Grand Price Shin Tanagawa) than what the hotel is currently charging their rooms, so travelers like us has to figure out their dinner plan ahead. I am very happy with our stay at the hotel. But we will probably book Shinagawa Prince hotel given it’s better location and proximity to more restaurants and shop within walking distance.","San Ramon, CA","Xofruitcake</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Ramon, CA</strong>",11,4.0

We did not dine in so can't comment about the offerings other than the room. The room was very spacious, comfortable and well appointed. We previously stayed at Prince Hotel Sakura Tce next door and this feels like an older version of that (older but still clean and tidy).Overall for price and location I would have rated it excellent except one major fault which was a big let down and I assume (hope?) is only temporary - the room temp was set at 25C and we prefer a colder room - only after payment and check in when we rang to ask why the aircon did not seem to be working were we told - ""not working, don't use it, open a window"". Not a practical solution unfortunately on this particular date and after a bit of discussion we were provided with cooling unit for the room which tried hard to work but did not really do the job. So staff did well to try and sort this for us, but something as significant as this should have been advised to us before we accepted the room / checked in.","Auckland, New Zealand","4Davesview</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",4,4.0

It also has kid friendly places like the arcade, aquarium, bowling alley and karaoke boxes along with lots of restaurants to choose from and supermarkets and food court.

After a long day in chaotic Tokyo, the garden’s tranquility is peaceful and also entertaining space for kids. We love the hotel and will always go back if we can.

So far we are quite happy with this hotel and hope hotel GM can read the message and other add some weight training equipment in the Gym or not charge guest to go group hotel gym because you don't have it yourself & Gluten Free option for guest is necessary i think, Most 5 star hotels offers gluten free option for people got Gluten allergic.

It has an amazing Japanese garden in the back yard and a good tepanyaki restaurant. There is a swimming pool, but you have to pay to visit, and a very small, basic gym for free.The room: It is very comfortable and big for the Japanese standards. People say that the decoration is outdated, but when you come back from a long day around Tokyo, you really don't care if the walls are painted beige, or the bathroom has old-fashioned tiles, you care for a comfortable bed and a clean bathroom, which you get. The cleaning service is excellent and they include plenty of amenities like combs, tooth brushes and women's amenities. The room also includes teabags and we thought they were for free, but they charge it almost 4euros for one teabag!But anyway in Tokyo you have to be prepared to spend a lot of money.If you don't want a hotel in the more central ereas, I would definitely recommend this one.","Amsterdam, The Netherlands","848xeniab</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Amsterdam, The Netherlands</strong>",12,4.0

I stayed at one of the other Prince hotels, the Park tower, around 10 years ago and had an absolutely fabulous day I genuinely couldn’t fault a thing and it’s one of my only five-star reviews on TripAdvisor.To be fair, the price at this hotel was very good compared to other hotels of a similar star rating in Tokyo so perhaps I’m being picky. However this is my second night and quite a lot of things have niggled me so far.The room: I paid for a club room and as such I expect a decent standard of room. The room is small and the bathroom is absolutely tiny if not claustrophobic. I know that Tokyo hotel rooms are small but again I stayed at the park tower a few years ago and the club room there was enormous. The bathroom here has a shower over the bath but it does not even have a fixed showerhead on the wall.The room itself is not too bad but for some unknown reason they have positioned a chair and a tiny table in the room which makes it impossible to walk to the bed. It is very clear that the room is far too small for this additional chair and table and basically it just stands in the middle of a gangway to the side of the bed. It’s just very silly and points out to everyone quite how small the room actually is.Breakfast: The reason I paid for a club lounge was to have access to a simple breakfast and evening drinks perhaps. Big problem is that coffee at breakfast is absolutely undrinkable. There is a coffee machine but as you look closely you will realise it is a Nescafe instant coffee machine and has never seen a fresh coffee bean in its life. I have just come from a Doubletree hotel in China and the coffee machine there served me beautiful expresses every morning. I even asked for filter coffee to see whether it was available in the club lounge but basically no; what you see is what you get and there were no other options available. I’m sorry but something resembling good coffee in the morning is absolutely necessary of a good class of hotel.Club lounge drinks: this evening I was out with my local agent having dinner and returned to the hotel at 8:50 PM. The club lounge is advertised as serving “nightcap drinks” until 9 PM. Therefore at 8:55 PM I poured myself a glass of wine in the club lounge only to be told at 9 PM that the club lounge is shut & asked to leave. Everyone knows that it does take a while to drink a drink after it has been poured therefore what on earth is the point of shutting the lounge immediately after the drinks are removed. I have never been in this situation before as normally a club lounge is open for at least half an hour after the last drinks or food is served.Opening hours: following the above “get myself a drink” disaster, I tried to retire to the bar only to be told that last orders were at 9:30 PM. Now I consider this very early for a full service hotel but no problem, had a drink and then left at around 945. At this point I saw another number of guests coming into the bar, who had just arrived from a flight and were clearly agitated that at that time they could not get a coffee, a drink or any food whatsoever. I don’t really understand who this hotel is aimed at. It clearly is not international business travellers or holidaymakers as presumably all these people have requirements outside the hours of 8am-9pm which appears to be the opening hours of the hotel.Overall, genuinely disappointed and certainly would not stay here again or recommend to others. I am also confused as it’s not in any way like the Prince Park Tower where I stayed many years ago and had excellent service all round. This hotel needs looking at and the market for it needs to be understood correctly as at the moment they are not serving anyone particularly well.","Oxford, UK","KMcH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxford, UK</strong>",41,3.0

One negative point is the room itself seemed quite worn and dated. I’m sure the New Takanawa hotel next to it would have been more contemporary and newer.Another issue experienced though was the safety deposit box in the room was not working properly. However this was swiftly resolved by a call downstairs and they sent someone up to check and eventually replaced it.We received standard amenities such as shower gels and other toiletries and this was replaced after each day when the room was tidied.We also had a decent view as the room allocated was at the front so we could see Tokyo tower in the distance which was nice.I wasn’t aware of the shuttle service between the hotel and Shinagawa station until we left as the lady porter at the entrance informed that it was free between the hotel and station and runs approximately every 10 minutes.Overall a nice but dated hotel, however reasonably priced for Tokyo. I would like to try the new takanawa hotel next door to compare the rooms but would equally recommend and wouldn’t mind staying here again.

One thing that you need to take note is there is some room that still not renovated so please request or book for renovated room. However, the room itself, I would rate Prince Sakura Tower as the best room but Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa is also acceptable. Another thing that I like this hotel is the lobby is not so crowded or busy unlike Grand Prince NEW Takanawa which there is always a lot of tour group and crowded. The breakfast buffet is nice.

I would offer a very strong recommendation. First, the hotel is located 1/3 a mile from the train station up a moderate grade hill. Shinagawa is a major station servicing many train lines including the high speed bullet trains. The hotel offers a shuttle between the train station which loops every twenty minutes early morning to night but is shared with two other Prince hotels. There were times when too many people wanted to board the shuttle and were turned away. The walk to the hotel from the station isn't bad although negotiating the hill with luggage or dealing with rainy conditions makes the shuttle quite desirable. The hotel was the oldest of the four Prince Hotels in Shinagawa, but was recently renovated. The room was quite spacious by Japan standards, although the bathroom a bit small compared to luxury US rooms. A desk area, floor table with two chairs, US power plugs, and digital TV with many American channels made us feel right at home.The grounds of the hotel are quite nice with a beautiful courtyard / park setting framed by cherry blossom trees. The club room was excellent - breakfast was quite hearty offering both American (fruits, pastries, bacon, sausage, omelette station, yogurt, etc...) and Japanese (miso soup, fish, rice) daily. The room has nonalcoholic beverages and fancy coffee drinks all day, at 5 pm to 9 pm alcohol is served with various appetizers / desserts. Pricing out Shinagawa hotel rooms with included restaurant breakfasts with a club room at the Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa during our March travel window made the decision pretty easy for the club room. Having experienced 8 days at the hotel and the great complementary breakfasts made me quite happy with the decision. I would add though, our room 1459 was immediately adjacent to the elevated and you could hear it whoosh by regularly.","Seattle, Washington","SeaMariner22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",66,5.0

We asked for beef refill for the dish but were told twice that they only cooked that quantities. The club lounge staff was very apologetic about it but this happened twice and it's apparent the hotel is on a cost cutting measures. My take is that if you are offering breakfast in club lounge as part of the whole package, then be generous about it. They had refills for steamed vegetables which was very lovely but not the beef.

The proximity to Shinagawa Station is brilliant - walkable within 10 minutes, if you've only got hand luggage/roll-on - but be aware that the hotel's on a modest hill, which could be strenuous for some.

Location:Located about 10 minutes walk from JR Shinagawa Station, the hotel is not extremely convenient especially when you are taking kids and holding luggage. However, it's embarrassing to get on a taxi because the distance is too close when you go by a vehicle. The hotel provides shuttle bus service to/from JR Shinagawa Station too.Room:The room is relatively small but having a view of Tokyo Tower in front of me makes me no further complaint. It's clean and has all amenities you need.Club Lounge:This is by far the best part of the stay. The Club Lounge is brand new, with ceiling-to-floor glasses overseeing the big beautiful Japanese garden. The cocktail time is surely the best time to visit. Different kinds of snacks and alcohols are available, with a quiet environment. But, note that kids are not allowed to enter the Club Lounge after 5pm. This makes most family vacationers difficult because you cannot leave your kids in the hotel room, right? So, perhaps the parents need to go by turn, if they really want to enjoy the cocktail hours.

(serve's me right for being a smoker, right?) It is well away form everyone and has 2 doors to enter so nothing smells like smoke until you go in the actual room and light up.A lovely hotel with lovely, helpful staff.The only thing I could point out that was strange - I asked for an iron and ironing board when I arrived and staff told me that they only had one for the entire hotel and that it wasn't available. I politely asked again and made a point of stating that one iron for a hotel of their size was ridiculous and asked very kindly if I could have the iron when it was available.5 minutes later, staff emerged with an iron and ironing board.As I went up to my room, I noticed another iron and ironing board leaning against someone else's door. Clearly, there is more than one iron available in the hotel.I know - it might seem trivial in the grand scheme of things, however, I refused to meet with colleagues for conferences in a chewed-up state. Even more so in Japan, where everyone places so much pride and effort in their appearance.So my only advice here would be if you need to be tidy and pressed, insist that you please have access to an iron.I would happily stay here again on a return visit.Japan is a marvellous place with the loveliest people in the world!","Sydney, Australia","Betty_Black_83</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",18,5.0

Let me also state that all of the Prince hotels are impeccably run, and are staffed with the nicest, most attentive people you can possibly have at a hotel. That said, this is an old place, that although clean and well-run, desperately is in need of a refresh. (just FYI, my wife and I stayed in this hotel in 1988, and it seemed the same as last time. The only change we observed were the lovely heated toilet seats with the automatic butt washers!) The room fixtures, carpeting, beds, desks, are all very old and tired. The rooms are less than half the size of the rooms at the Sakura next door. The beds are very small also. (our king bed was really a queen..) The breakfast buffet had much less to offer than the Sakura, and was about the same price, so if you are paying for it (we didn't pay at the Sakura), you would be better off going next door for the buffet. Plus, the meals here were skewed more for Japanese tastes than the Sakura. The place was quite a bit noiser as well, less isolation with the halls and other rooms.","Indianapolis, Indiana","Jeff W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Indianapolis, Indiana</strong>",27,3.0

There are so many great things about it, yet some basics are not up to snuff from an American viewpoint. In the end I had to go with a 4 star, although my actual rating would have been 3.7. The hotel site itself is wonderful. Two Prince properties face each other with a Japanese garden in between them (it's easy to go to a wrong one. the other one has the word ""new"" in its name). The hotel is perched on a hill which affords a great view of Tokyo. A Train station is just down the hill - a short walk. Which makes it easy to get around the city. As is normal in Tokyo, the train station support a big cluster of restaurants and shops. All of this makes for a great convenience. The hotel itself is somewhat dated in its architecture, but is not run down. Interior is, however, well passed its prime. Everything is spotless, but worn. Carpets are overdue for replacement. Furnishings are scratched and worn. In America this would not be tolerated, in a higher end property, but because the original furnishings were of pretty good quality, the hotel gets away with it. Still, you get a sense that the hotel is long overdo for a facelift. Rooms are smaller than normal for an American hotel room of the same class. The interiors are functional and clean, but at least 25 years old. As is normal for most of the Japanese hotels, the automated toilets spoil you with the warm spray, bide, and drying action. Shower is inadequate by American standards. Beds, while old, are very comfortable. Bedding itself is great. Everything has been maintained in a perfect working order. Service at the hotel is flawless. A number of staff are eager and willing to help and assist at every turn, always with a smile and a bow. The place runs like a well oiled machine.

In terms of location and convenience, it is great (See my recent review on the Shinagawa Prince regarding location). It is a little farther from the JR Shinagawa station than the Shinagawa Prince, but there is a shuttle that connects all four Prince hotels in the area. The downside is that the shuttle runs every 20 minutes, so you do have to plan accordingly. Still, it is a short walk to the train station, so we only needed the shuttle when lugging luggage. The rooms were slightly larger than the Shinagawa Prince, and similarly clean. Still, the room size is smaller compared to US hotels, but that always seems to be the case in Japan? Service was excellent. A plus was its proximity to the Takanawa gardens. It was nice to have this patch of green amid the otherwise bustling train station area. Like the Shinagawa Prince, there was an empty mini fridge in the room, and this fridge seemed to keep things at an appropriate temperature (The one in our room at the Shinagawa Prince seemed to be on the warm side--maybe that was a fluke?). Free WiFi, both Japanese and English language newspapers delivered daily. We did not go to any of the restaurants, but noticed that the lounge area served siphon style coffee. There are no gift shops in the hotel itself, but it is next to a convention hall and the New Takanawa hotel where there are about 5 mini shops, including a 7-11, a souvenir shop and a few dress shops. Since I often travel with a young child, proximity to a self serve laundromat (called 'coin laundry' or koin randorii in Japanese) is important. There was apparently one about a 10 minute walk away near a police station (koban), but I could not find it. There is also a playground across the street, if you are traveling with kids. Anyway, no complaints.

The tower view was the part I looked forward to, and also I wanted my friends to see Tokyo Tower from the room. However, they did not get the view, either. The front office staff did not tell me about it upon check-in where they should have because they sell rooms by categorising tower view and garden view. I could not be bothered to tell them after a long day. I am more than please to write that the room with garden view was good.

The breakfast was below par in terms of the spread and nearly non-existent in service standards; newspapers on the stand were far less than table occupancy; only the rate charged was significantly higher. I would strongly recommend picking up breakfast supplies the previous night from the nearby Seven-Eleven as I did after my first experience.Not a hotel I would return to again.

It has rooms of more or less standard North American size (well, slightly smaller, but not significantly smaller) and that is nice when you need to relax or do some paper work in hotel.It takes about 7 to 8 minutes on foot from JR Shinagawa Station, but it's an uphill walk. If you don't like it, you can get a free shuttle bus service from Shinagawa Prince Hotel lobby area. I believe it runs every 20 minutes.Since it is located on a low hill, it commands a very nice view of Tokyo. Towards the northeast you have a great view of Tokyo and Tokyo Tower and beyond. On the other side of the building, you have a great view of its own Japanese style garden below.The hotel is served by an hourly airport bus to Narita International Airport. It's a door-to-door service to both Terminals 1 and 2 in about 70-75 minutes.

One of the remarkable features of these hotels is their garden. The garden is surrounded by these 3 hotels. One of the best seasons is spring, because you can enjoy cherry blossoms in this garden. There is an approaching road from Shinagawa Station to Grand Price Hotel Takanawa. It will be full of cherry flowers both sides of the road. There is a lounge called ""Komyo Lounge"" on the first floor in Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa. You can see its beautiful Japanesse garden with sky from the huge glass wall from the floor to the high ceiling, which gives you relaxing and enjoyable time. It is really beautiful in spring and autumn. In the evening you can see beautiful and mysterious cherry blossom with lightening up. On the other hand, you can see other cherry blossoms from the Itarian restaurant ""Ristorante Caffè Ciliegio"" in Sakura Tower. I tried to book this restaurant when the cherries fully bloomed but could not do it as expected. The cherry trees are on the hill which you can see from the restaurant magnificently. I don't know how to book the box seats equipped on the hill. If you can book it successfully, you can really enjoy cherry blossoms under the cherry trees. Price-wise Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa is cheaper and we usually arrange to book it. But Sakura Tower is quite new and clean and has magnificent view of cherry blossoms from the room in spring. Some of them who stayed both in the Sakura Tower and the Takanawa strongly recommed the Sakura Tower because it is not only new and clean but also size of the rooms are bigger than the Takanawa.

I do not know how much it cost, but there was a good selection of Western items, better than some other hotels I stayed at in Japan.The big negative for me was when I first entered the room, it smelled like someone just took a dump in the bathroom. It was quite strong, even for a who works around animal manure. Fortunately, I knew exactly what the problem was as it happens sometimes in our basement.

Meaning, there is already a typical Japanese koi garden at the back of the hotel where kids can play and wander the greeneries after a long day's tour, a shuttle bus every 15 minutes that leads you to Shinagawa MTR station since the hotel is situated along the residential hill side village of takanawa, a good breakfast buffet at passion restaurant, a fast complimentary Wifi at the hotel lobby (room has a fee), and a decent room (not grand) in terms of comfortable beds but a typical outdated furnishing (tube TV, no espresso machine, flat iron for pressing and fridge supplies) which I think is typical to a timeless business hotel like this not to mention the fabulous toilet seats (japanese standard push button bidet) . Crib is provided for my infant upon request and so is the sofa bed and the bell captain at the reception is very much willing to help for anything you ask from the tours, to transportation and food.

They spoke English, but don't expect it to be perfect. All the lobby and restaurant staff spoke English, but housekeeping did not. When I first got to the hotel, I could not believe how European the lobby looked. It was huge, and it was the only place that wifi worked. In the rooms, there was only a landline. When I got to the room, it wasn't very big. It was either because it was a typical Japanese hotel rooms (famous for being small) or the fact that I did order an extra bed. It was still nice though, with a table and a chair. The beds were really comfy, too. There was also a nice little balcony, and mine had a great view. The toilet was not exactly gigantic, but it was well equipped. The water also had a nice pressure. The only bad thing was that the closet was very hidden and it did not have a door. It was very difficult to get your clothes out, but there were still clean hangers laid out for you. There was a convenience store on the bottom floor, with lots of stuff to buy. In the basement there was a restaurant, which you need to have breakfast coupons. The great thing about these coupons are that you can use them on room service breakfast, which was very continent for me, since I left early on the last day. There was a shuttle bus to both airports, and to the JR Station (railway). The thing about both, it that you have to book for them. Even though they had a shuttle bus for the station, it wasn't that far away, around a five minute walk. You can see the hotel from the station, too.

Great location just minutes from Shinagawa station. South side rooms with garden view onto nice Japanese garden. Efficient elevators, not much waiting. WLAN in room at extra cost, wired at zero cost (you can make your own WLAN with tethering). Efficient housekeeping, most of the time they did it while I was at breakfast. One day I had room breakfast, scheduled 6:00 am, which allows them 6:00 – 6:30, arrived 6:15. House guest Sushi menu was very good for the price. Tempura in Wakatake restaurant was rather expensive and had strange things like fried fishbone and small fish to be eaten as a whole, one bitter. So be careful what you choose. Breakfast is fine, except that the table cards they request you to take to the table sometimes are sticky from someone elses jam. A fried egg took very long to make.

One thing annoyed me: They had left a message on the mailbox to tell me that my bill was over 10.000 Yen and I am required to pay “at once”. Firstly, I had given my credit card at check-in, secondly the 10.000 probably should have read 100.000 and thirdly “at once” put me off. I asked them to check again. They probably called after that but that was when I had my massage so I ignored it. Next day I asked the cashier. It obviously had been a mistake.

This hotel is usually a little bit less expensive, and depending on your priorities, it may be a better choice.The hotel, lacking the ""New"" prefix, is indeed somewhat older, probably dating to the 1970s, and this is borne out by details such as the lobby, the in-room furniture, the bathroom fixtures -- and the height of the bathroom counter! But unlike a 40-year-old hotel in North America, Takanawa Prince is impeccably maintained and in very good condition indeed.The rooms are of a decent size by even North American standards, and probably somewhat larger than those in New Takanawa Prince. The furniture aside, they are very clean, with plenty of storage and a well-equipped bathroom. The rooms have either a city view (you should be able to see Tokyo Tower) or a garden view, both are very nice. Beds are firm (as always in Japan) and the pillows are OK.You can choose to skip cleaning on alternate days and get a restaurant/convenience store coupon worth JPY 00 per skipped day. An upside compared to New Takanawa Prince, let alone Shinagawa Prince, is that few large groups seem to stay at Takanawa Prince, so the lobby is much more quiet and calm than at the other two hotels.The walk from Shinagawa Station is a little less than 10 minutes, but it does mean walking up a fairly steep hill. The limo bus from the airport will deliver you to the hotel door, though. The other options for trains are Sengakuji on the Asakusa line (on the same street as the Shinagawa station, but turn left when you get there and walk about 500m) -- or Takanawadai, also on the Asakusa line. Takanawadai is my personal favourite option, and is also less than 10 minutes away, but at the top of the hill. Cutting through the garden and New Takanawa Prince is the fastest way to get there.Shinagawa not only has good connections, it also has a lot of food options. On the west side (where the hotel is), I'll mention the sushi and tempura restaurants in the basement of Wing Tanakawa, Mango Cafe across from McDonald's and Devi Corner near Sengakuji. The east side has scores of restaurants of every type. And Gotanda, with even more choices, including the 82 Ale House, is only about a 20-minute walk away.",Curacao,"tomh009</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Curacao</strong>",141,4.0

We spent 5 days in the hotel and used trains as our transportation to roam around Tokyo. From Narita Airport, it is accessible by NeX trains going to Shinagawa station but we bought the Airport Limousine (bus) ticket coz they will bring you infront of the hotel entrance which costs 6000 Yen round trip plus a free 2 day unlimited rides for Tokyo Metro Line. I had a great time with my family; we are 5 and we got 2 rooms, with different views, the other side on the garden, and on the other side the Tokyo Tower. The room was clean and surprisingly larger, compared to the typical tokyo rooms.Their garden was very beautiful, it has a historical temple on it with a pond filled with fishes, very Japanese themed place, picturesque. We actually bought Yukata and wore it and took pictures in the garden. The garden is known to be a site of cherry blossom trees but too bad we went there mid-spring. There are also a good number of restaurants in the area, a 7-11 convenience store nearby, their cheap packed dinner tastes good actually, a must try. This hotel is uphill and it takes 10 minutes to walk to and from Shinagawa station, but you can use the shortcut by walking through Sakura hotel. The staff are not very good in English but simplifying your words helped them what you meant. It is also a good base for tours, however you need to transfer to the Grand Prince New Takanawa Hotel for pick-ups.

Overall, we enjoyed our stay and below are some of the pluses and minuses we experienced.Location is good and easy to find. It's close to Shinagawa Station--about 5 minutes walk but you have to walk up the hill to the hotel (other Prince brand hotels are a little closer and with no uphill walk). I think location makes it a good place for those who are not familiar with Tokyo. Narita Express (certain cars) stops at Shinagawa Station so we were able to travel here directly from the airport without changing trains (saving us from dragging luggages to board crowded commuter trains). Although there are not a lot of attractions nearby, JR Yamanote line stops at Shinagawa Station which makes traveling to Tokyo's major attractions easy. Shinkansen (bullet train) to Osaka, Kyoto, and Nagoya stops at Shinagawa Station, so traveling to and from these cities is easy also.The hotel has a nice garden which is shared with another Prince hotel. When we were there around the end of March, Sakura (cherry blossom) was in full bloom which made the garden very beautiful and a nice place to stroll around and relax.We heard a lot about how small hotel rooms in Japan were but it was a pleasant surprise to see our room was fairly spacious. (It was bigger than other hotel rooms we stayed in during our trip while paying about the same rate). It had a nice garden view. (Rooms on the other side had view of Tokyo Tower). Wire internet was also available from the room and they had wire ready to use in the room.The hotel's AC system can only be set to either cooling or heating at a time for the whole hotel. When we were there, though the weather outside was cold, the room was a bit too warm so we wanted cooling AC system. However, only heat could be used at that time. So if you go there during certain seasons (spring or fall), you might not get what you want as far as AC is concerned.The hotel has a number of restaurants but I couldn't comment on food quality as we didn't dine in any of them. They are much more expensive than restaurants around the station.We also noticed the sign saying that the hotel provided shuttle service to the airport. The price was comparable to Narita Express, so it can be a good alternative if you don't have JR Pass. Again, we didn't use it, so I can't comment on it other than the fact that it's available.Staff were nice and friendly. Check-in and check-out process was quick and easy.Overall, I found Grand Price Hotel Takanawa a good hotel to stay in Tokyo especially for the ease of commute (within Tokyo, to/from the airport, and to/from other cities). It's particularly beautiful and can be a destination by itself in spring when Sakura is blooming!","Chicago, Illinois","JT2520</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",87,4.0

While the walk maybe considered long by some, it allows you to walk through some very nice scenery which during the Spring season is wonderful. The rooms in the hotel are very large by Japanese standards which enables you to relax during your stay. Depending on the room that you have booked you can see either a view of Tokyo, including the Tokyo Tower & Skytree or a view of the Garden which is very nice indeed. Staff are very friendly in the Hotel and will try their best to speak to guests in English. However, I would advise you learn a little Japanese before you go to Japan as it makes the experience a whole lot more enjoyable. There are several facilities near the hotel including the Aquarium, Cinema and a small eatery plaza. the rooms are clean, in some rooms the walls are slightly thin but it was no bother to us.","Farnborough, United Kingdom","gyunyu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Farnborough, United Kingdom</strong>",14,5.0

There is another Takanawa Prince hotel which may be confusing for some. Better check before you get there as it can be a bit of a walk with luggage.My biggest complaint is that you find yourself planning your day around the shuttle bus, which really shouldn't be the case on your holiday. You need to catch a shuttle bus to get to the hotel. You have to wait in line for the bus at the train station and when the bus arrives it is just a mad rush for seats as the bus is small. I don't mind walking uphill, but that was just ridiculous. The last bus is also at 8:00pm or 8:30pm. So for some people who think it is a waste of money to spend 710yen (can be spent on sushi instead!) on a cab to take them the short distance uphill or if it is raining too heavily to walk uphill with all your bags, you need to get there is time.Then catching the bus from the hotel requires a reservation. This shuttle also stops at 3 other hotels so be sure to book in advance and not the night before.8pm is far too early to be stopping the shuttle bus, since a lot of shops only shut closer to 10pm. This has been communicated to the hotel but nothing has changed. The room itself is clean. Unfortunately, we requested a non-smoking room but got a room on the smoking floor. The bell captain offered to send up a bottle of air freshener and suggested we open the window to air it out. This helped a bit.There is enough space to have two large luggage open. It is more spacious than a few hotels in Tokyo. There is no WiFi in the room, only in the hotel. The connection is ok but wish a hotel that was charging me that much could provide WiFi in the rooms.The bed is clean and they provide yukatas to use in the room, you will have to search the drawers for them. You can sign up for their 'green cleaning service' which is a decent idea, you get a 500yen coupon for choosing not to have your room cleaned each night.In the middle of the night, there was a man shouting in the next room and the staff failed to handle the situation and he continued to shout throughout the night until early morning ( he got tired?). The air-con was a puzzle, even after putting it on the lowest setting it was still quite stuffy. Since it was raining at the time we couldn't open the window much. Even when the display said 23degs, it felt a lot warmer.Overall, this is a much more expensive hotel which did not deliver. Breakfast was not included, and the hotel is pretty secluded unless you walk back downhill to the station which does have good food. This was a last minute booking for me, if I had the option of early booking, this would not be on my short-list. This is more of a family style hotel or maybe for a wedding. I saw a few weddings held there. The garden was lovely and the koi pond was very serene.","Melbourne, Australia","LilaAngel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",12,3.0

This hotel is conveniently located for easy access to all parts of Tokyo and the airports since Shinagawa Station is only 8-minute away. Hotel staffs are very professional, friendly and helpful. They provided us with excellent service. We got room #959; it is a superior twin room (two beds) with garden view. This room is spacious and clean. Beds are firm and comfortable; sheets are clean. Bathroom is large and clean. The amenities include: shampoo set, tooth brush set, disposable razor, bathrobe, slippers, shower cap, comb and hair dryer; cotton swabs, ladies' personal care accessories; safe, electric kettle and tea bags, as well as a small fridge. There is free (wired) Internet access in the room and complimentary English newspaper is provided in the morning. Free Wifi is available in the lobby area. Currency exchange service is also available in this hotel. We also got a welcome champagne coupon for two and we used it at Asama Main Bar located on the first floor. There are many restaurants in this hotel and its sisters’ hotels (Prince Hotel Takanawa New and Prince Hotel Sakura). There is also a 7/11 store inside of Prince Hotel Takanawa New. Besides, there is a beautiful Japanese garden in this hotel resort. TIPS for getting to the hotel from the Narita airport:At tourist center in Narita airport, we bought a Suica&NEX package, which costs only 5500JPY (for ordinary car) per package, including round trip JR NEX tickets (Narita to Shinagawa and Shinagawa to Narita), a 1000JPY worth of fare for public transportation within the Tokyo area and 500JPY of refundable deposit. By the way, it costs 3500JPY for a single JR train ticket from Narita to Shinagawa station, so it is already worth the money. Suica can be reloaded at any station; in addition it can be used in some stores and even at the vending machine, very convenient! You can return Suica in the end of you journey (This card becomes invalid if it is not used for ten years) at the ticket counter of a JR (Suica) or non-JR (PASMO) railway station. Unused credit can also be refunded (210 yen handling fee applies).From the Narita airport, it takes about 45 minutes to get Shinagawa Station, which is a big station, very busy, take west exit - TAKANAWA EXIT (WEST EXIT) (see my photo). Here comes tricky part: make sure which Prince hotel you stay with and we learnt it by the hard way. The Prince Hotel Resort including The Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa (old), The Prince Hotel Takanawa New and the Prince Hotel Sakura. There is also a The Prince Hotel nearby, but does not belong to the resort. These hotels are all very close to Shinagawa station. 1. For going to The Prince Hotel Takanawa New, come out from station, cross the pedestrian at green traffic light, turn right and you run into Zakuro-zaka Street in a minute, cross this street first and turn left, then walk up (a small hill, not flat street) about 5-6 minutes and hotel entrance is at your right. 2. For going to both Prince Hotel Sakura and Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa, come out from station, turn right and keep walking until the first traffic light (about 3 minutes, and there is a 7/11 store nearby), cross the pedestrian to arrive at Sakura-zaka Street, walk about 3 minutes to reach Prince Hotel Sakura and 6 minutes to reach Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa. Both are at your left.There is a complimentary hotel shuttle bus goes to Shinagawa Station from all these Prince hotels, but you need to make reservation in advance at hotel and they do not take reservation for pick-up service from Shinagawa Station. However, you can get on the shuttle bus if you run into it at the station.","Davis, California","Jane L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Davis, California</strong>",196,4.0

Rooms were quiet.Nice view of the Tokyo tower from our 5th floor room and some of the city.It was raining all week and the hotel sat out umbrellas you could take with you around town. Not sure if that is a custom with all Japanese hotels but this as well as how accommodating they were to the guests is what stands out in my mind about the hotel.They had some restaurants and lounges in the hotel but we only ate at the buffet one breakfast. Compared to U.S. standards a bit pricey and limited menu but more than enough food choice to fill yourself up with.They also had a small business center you could use to make copies, use PCs and print items.If I had the opportunity to return to Tokyo, this hotel is definitely on my list of where to stay.","San Fernando, California","Jerry B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Fernando, California</strong>",30,5.0

We were booked in a ""Deluxe Garden View Double King"" room and it was enormous, in particular by Tokyo Standards. The room had plenty of room for lounge chairs, a writing desk along with this it had masses of storage space and a large wardrobe and tea making facilities.The hotel is a short walk uphill from Shinagawa station (the walk only took us 5-7 minutes each time depending on whether we took the garden or road path). When you arrive at the hotel you are greeted by friendly staff at the desk along with staff to help with luggage.The hotel is set on a 'complex' with several other Prince hotels with a beautiful garden with carp pond, there are several restaurants on site and at other hotels in the complex. Aside from this there are several convenience stores, a post office (with international ATM) and shops down on the street leading to Shinagawa station. The station itself has many restaurants of good quality if you want to eat near the hotel.The hotel is undergoing renovations and while our room was a little 'dated' I have no doubt it will be on the renovation schedule.

Simple enough.So let's try for the positives first. Generously proportioned rooms with largish windows and decent views. Close to the Shinagawa Station on the JR Line of the subway, the best line for connecting to every other line in the wildly complicated if incredibly thorough Tokyo subway system. A decent cafe, the Patio, for light meals and a glass of wine at a reasonable cost. Nice koi pond. Comfortable bus to Narita Airport.Negatives. First the obvious: your reservation will show that you have wifi (surcharge, of course) in your room. Well, not really. In this Japan, once the world's leader in new technologies (remember the Walkman?), in this hotel, you have to ask for a router, which the hotel may or may not have available. If they have one available, they will eventually bring it to your room and plug it in and, voila, you have wifi, which you must renew every day. If they do not have a router available, they you are out of luck, baby! Welcome to the 20th century! Hey, hotel people: install wifi!!! You are a business and convention hotel. Your American business guests were walking around looking for wifi. Wake up Grand Prince, this is the twenty first century, the one where wifi is ubiquitous.Other negatives: let see, the concierge? Useless, worse than useless. Other negatives: I mentioned that the price of wine in the Patio cafe is reasonable. Well, yes, especially compared to the lounge where it is more than twice as expensive, for a glass of wine that is not twice as good; compared to the Bar, where the wine is more than twice as expensive, though not the same price as the lounge, and, again, not twice as good. Compared to the restaurants, where the price is different again, and much more expensive and no better.And more negs: although the location is a 10 minute walk from the Shinagawa Station, it is a 10 minute walk mostly up-hill. There is a van from the hotel to the station every 30 minutes, though when I asked the Bell Captain if there was a van, she said no. For Bell Captain, see the description of the concierge.And more: there are no decent restaurant choices near the hotel. To have an evening out, you must leave, not just the hotel, but also the area, and travel to Roppongi, Omotesando or the Ginza, ok, if you are willing to spring for cabs there and back, or if you have mastered the subway system. The area around the hotel is the most boring in Tokyo.And more: the walls between rooms are paper thin; the ceilings have little or no noise insulation so if the people above you walk with more than a tiptoe, you will hear every foot fall; I had to change rooms, the people above me were so foot heavy. And someone talking in the hall seems to be in your room with you.Btw: do hotels really still use curtains in the shower in the bathroom? I thought that was very last century.More negs: If you can't get a router, you can try the business center (a joke of a name) where access to the internet will cost you Y100 per 5 minutes - of course, there is no help with the system, which is in Japanese, so your first couple of hundred yen are used trying to figure out how to connect, and how much e-mail can you handle in one five minute increment? My advice - go to the concierge, who is useless, and demand that she find you a router for your room, and that she do that immediately. Stand your ground in front of her desk, and continue to make your demand; magically, a router, heretofore unfindable, will appear in your room. Golly!I would never choose this hotel again, nor recommend it to anyone. It's not that it sucks, it's that it does nothing well, and does many things so poorly as to be almost laughable; laughable that is, unless you really need wifi, and then it isn't laughable, it is unforgivable.Ophelia, get thee to another hotel in a better part of town!","New York City, New York","William B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",229,2.0

Essentially the hotels are all aimed at the group and meetings market - but perfect also for individual travellers. The rooms are spacious with good facilities. My only complaint is that the internet connection is not WiFi (but it is complimentary, albeit a wired connection). Breakfast is extensive and adequate - with both Japanese and Western options.

I have come to enjoy very peaceful morning walks in the spacious garden before business starts for the day. This kind of sanctuary in the heart of Tokyo is incredibly unusual and a real treat. If you like older (probably built in the 60s), more traditional hotels you won't be disappointed. If you're a chain/points guy that prefers upscale US hotels like Hyatt, Westin, Hilton, Marriott then this probably isn't for you.

The reservation was made hurriedly by my business associate, but the hotel staff were more than ready to receive me when I arrived to check in that evening.This hotel is located at the top of a hill, and it is not easy to locate the shuttle bus if you do not know where it stops. I was unable to find the shuttle bus stop at the Shinagawa Station, so I trudged my way uphill with my luggage and belongings. If you are anything short of being very fit, this can be a very tiring task.Service at this hotel was very good. The Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa actually shares its immediate area with two other hotels in the Prince group of hotels, namely the New Takanawa and Sakura Tower. It can be confusing to figure out which entrance was which if you have never been here, and I ended up at the New Takanawa instead. However, the hotel staff were very nice, and even had a bellhop help me with my luggage and direct me to the correct hotel. These three hotels share a common, but very large Japanese garden, which is a must-see if you stay here.My room at this hotel was large with a high ceiling, and included two twin beds, a large sofa and desk. The room was very clean, and the bathroom was spotless. A slated wooden door separated the main entrance/closet/bathroom area from the rest of the room, which gave it an almost suite-like feel. The furnishings were rather old and dated, but I appreciated the space that this room offered, a rare treat when it comes to Tokyo hotels.During my first two nights here I ran into some problems with the free Internet connection, and was unable to log on to do my work. However, the toll-free tech support was very helpful, and spoke excellent English.

Free Internet access is a plus, and I have no complaints.Because the nuclear power plant disaster in Fukushima has robbed Tokyo of one of its main sources of electrical power, the hotel--and the city--are subject to heavy pressures to reduce electrical waste on luxuries like air conditioning. This was translated by the hotel into a restriction barring guests from setting the room thermostat below 28⁄° C (82° F).

The hotel grounds are beautiful (lots of Sakura) so the locals have weddings there.We would usually head out in the mornings from our room at the GP Takanawa, cross the garden to the GP New Takanawa, visit the ATM for the day's shopping/eating expedition, then cross the main lobby of the GP New Taka., drop down one floor at the large stair well at the faaar end of the lobby, and exit out past the pastry shop onto the street. Via that street, it's a down hill stroll (less steep than the winding road between Shinagawa Station and the main entry to the GP Takanawa) east to the short driveway (it's on your right, just after the Royal Host diner) to the Epson Aqua Stadium (dolphin show and penguins if you're interested). Once at the entry to the Epson, head left down hill into the building complex and you'll walk right past the 7-11 (to pick up misc. supplies or snacks). Keep walking down the stairs, and you'll find the McD's for a convenient bite (note that McD's has hot dogs in Japan!). You'll also be at the cross walk to Shinagawa Station. After you cross the street from McD's and just enter the station complex, there's an escalator to your right that heads down a flight into a store with tons of bento boxes (take-out Japanese food) as well as a groceries in the back (note that the bentos and the groceries are separate vendors). We would usually visit this place at the end of our day to pick-up great tasting, cheap eat-in food, snacks and drinks if we were tired and just wanted to kick-back in the hotel room. Note that the hotel room trash cans are tiny, so save those plastic grocery bags for your trash -- the hotel housekeepers will appreciate your neatness.The station has lots of food places in the JR Lines main concourse, through the central ticket gate (just inside of the west (Takanawa) entrance). Note that these are on the platform side of the turnstiles, so you have to either purchase a train ticket or have a rail pass on hand to get in there. If, for some reason, you fear turnstiles, there's also a big Starbucks towards the east entry to the station, up on the 2nd floor, that has a terrific view of the mass of humanity marching through the station (snag a table overlooking the main lobby before ordering your beverage and croissant).I'd do it again.","Hawi, Hawaii","MyManao</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hawi, Hawaii</strong>",6,4.0

Our room had a great view of the city and at night could see the Tokyo Tower. The room was a good size and very clean. Since we haven't been to Japan before we were a little worried about finding our way around. Luckily, our hotel was just 10 walking minutes away to the fabulous Shinagawa Station. The Shinagawa Station was extremely convienient since it connects to may train lines. Also in walking distance was 7-11 for those late night snacks or a quick breakfast before jumping on the train.We ended up staying there our entire trip, 9 days and truly enjoyed the experience.",hawaii,"Presley1234</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>hawaii</strong>",3,5.0

The hotel its self is very clean, upscale and nice. Its located in a business area, so the hotel is aimed for the business crowd, though we didn't have any problem enjoying it. Our rooms were comfortable and we even had a great view of the garden and koi pond from our room. The hotel's garden connects it to two other hotels located in the area. Because the hotel was aimed to the business crowd they did have a small business room with free internet service, which was nice. However, internet in you room cost money. The hotel also had about 4 or 5 restaurants located inside for you to eat.The hotel is located in the Sinagawa area, which is not a popular tourist area but a popular business area. We didn't find this a problem, because the hotel was located close to the train station where you can take the Yamamoto line to all of the major tourist areas of Tokyo (Harajuku, Ginza, Shibuya, ect). Each area is about 15-20 mins away on the train, but beware the train stations close at 2am! Every day we would wake up, walk down the street, get breakfast at the McDonalds near by then jump on the train to explore. I would recommend staying in this area because even though it was father away from the city, all attractions are reachable by train. We got to see all of Tokyo with out paying lots of money for a hotel located in the heart of Ginza or Shibuya.","Los Angeles, California","travel_allsn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",26,5.0

The location is really nice, just a block from the Shinagawa Station, which is one of the busiest stations, but you have to walk up a small hill to find the hotel. Since you're by the station, there's a good number of restaurants, even a McDonald's, which was the cheapest thing to eat in Tokyo. There isn't much sightseeing around Shinagawa, but the station connects to the main JR Rail Line in Tokyo, so you can reach more exciting places within 15 minutes. The hotel is a very nice business-type hotel. Contrary to the exterior of the hotel, the decor in the lobby and rooms is actually new and nice, plus its very clean. We picked the hotel because it was cheaper, so I was expecting it to be worse, but the rooms were very nice and much like typical American hotels, in size and cleanliness. We felt a little out of place because there didn't seem to be any other tourists in the hotel, but the staff was always extremely polite and helpful. The hotel is actually part of 3 hotels that share grounds, which include a large Japanese-style garden. Also, many tours pick-up from one of the New Takanawa, which is convenient. Overall, it was a really good base location to explore Tokyo. It was surprisingly very clean and nice on the inside, and I felt for the price it was a really good value.",California,"ticondy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",68,5.0

The hotel is in an excellent location within walking distance from the Shinagawa Train Station. You can take the train from the airport right to Shinagawa or another station that is on another line. If you travel outside of Tokyo on the Shinkansen (bullet train) you can walk to the station for the Shinkansen. The GP Takanawa is part of a complex with three or four other GP hotels that share a beautiful Japanese garden. Within walking distance there are sights to see, restaurants, shops and most important plenty of transportation. If you travel to Tokyo, be prepared to walk. There is a slight incline on the street that goes from the Shinagwa Station to the hotel, but it is not bad. We used to save a little of distance by entering through the nearest hotel and cutting through the lobby to the garden. My only complain about the stay was that TV was all in Japanese... but then again you are not going to Japan to watch TV, so that is a minimal inconvinience. Eating in the hotel can be expensive, so I suggest you look outside. Breakfast buffet runs $25/person, but it is a brunch that includes from soup to nuts... literally. So you can have breakfast and dinner and you will be fine.In conclusion, we would stay again in that hotel when we go back to Tokyo.","Hendersonville, North Carolina","greenarch_Miami</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hendersonville, North Carolina</strong>",13,4.0

No connecting rooms but kids in a room straight across the hall which works out ok. All single beds no double/queen etc but this seems the norm all over Japan. Breakfast is good.
