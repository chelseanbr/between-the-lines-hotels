I'm so impressed, though I'd stay here again even if I was spending a few days in Honolulu. The staff are fantastic--friendly and very helpful. The rooms are clean and comfortable--nothing fancy, but the price is 1/2 that of a Waikiki hotel. If you just use a hotel to sleep, this will do the trick! Best of all for the budget-minded, The Bus stops right outside the hotel and $5.50 gets you an all-day pass. It's about an hour to central Waikiki, and even shorter the other way to Pearl Harbor. On the downside, not a lot of restaurants nearby you can walk to at night. I didn't expect a lot out of this hotel, but was very pleasantly surprised.","Phoenix, Arizona","thechronictraveller</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",23,4.0

It's away from Waikiki traffic and close to the airport. Yes, its close to the freeway so you can hear traffic. What we do to counter the noise is carry our noise makers (got them from amazon for under $50 and they fit in your luggage or backpack). I recommend reserving a bigger room if traveling with several pieces of luggage (we lave lots of luggage because we are usually there on business). If you travel light, the smaller room may suffice. Parking garage is like all other garages, tight. It costs $30/night but cost us $15/night because we are Gold Crown Members. Breakfast is included, usually count on scrambled eggs, oatmeal, rice, mini pancakes, fruit, etc. They alternate between Portuguese sausage and sausage links, with bacon once a week. Also, if you go early, you can usually get right in. If you go with tourists, you may have to wait for a table. But its not usually a long wait. The bed slept good. TV can suck because the signal breaks up on some channels (but most people don't even use the TV while there). Housekeeping is extremely polite and friendly and cater to whatever you may need. Mercy took care of us most of the time (we were in room #805) and she is the BEST!!! The only down fall to our last visit was on our last day. We waited thru 6 elevators before we could get on along with a cart full of luggage. Evidently, as it gets closer to the New Year, it gets more and more crowded. But its all good - we got out without too much delay. We will definitely be staying here again.","Lewisburg, Tennessee","bitsmom_tn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lewisburg, Tennessee</strong>",56,5.0

Because of coronavirus, my plans changed, and I did not stop over in Honolulu. I called the housekeeping manager to explain the change in plans, and she worked with me to send it back safely to me at my home in California. Everyone was very friendly and professional.

The WIFI (free for Best Western members) also works very well. However, the window remains extremely dirty and they need replacement.

Trying to get down to the lobby in the morning especially is terrible, you will literally wait for 20 minutes or more as the elevator not only is trying to pick up people leaving/checking out but also the cleaning teams are trying to get from floor to floor. Sometimes when the elevator finally gets to your floor it is to full to even get on, so you wait again unless you want an aerobic workout doing the stairs. Our room had roaches to greet us upon entering. Parking can be a bit tight if you return to late as there are not enough parking spaces. There is a fairly decent free breakfast each morning and if you join the Best Western club you can get half price on your parking. I would not recommend this location if you want the resort feel as it is located under a freeway under path. 10-15 minutes ride to Waikiki.

For raising temperature inside room, need to stop the climate control system and room temperature will rise naturally. they have one computer and printer in the lobby. Guest can use it and print required documents in black and white free of cost.This hotel provide free hot buffet breakfast from 6 to 10 AM in restaurant adjoining to the hotel. after that this portion use at restaurant for this hotel. Breakfast quality was very good and varieties items were available to it, which were in my opinion better than average. Free shuttle from hotel to airport was also available every half an hour.

I expected to see the Aloha Spirit as they cater to many diversities including locals. I can honestly say that 3 people out of the entire front desk staff during my stay were friendly and very helpful. If I didn’t see those 3 I dreaded going to the front desk. The one name I remember is Rose. She was not helpful nor friendly and just stared at her computer screen while I spoke to her. I greeted her with a smile and hello and she just looked at me as if I was bothering her and asked another girl who was friendly to help me validate my parking ticket, which btw I had to keep validating daily. When at the gate calling for help to let me out seemed like a chore for whoever was on the other side. It was the same thing everyday, you need to pull another ticket and validate at the front desk.

First issue, as a rewards member and frequent guest at this hotel, one would assume a higher level of customer service towards returned and loyal guests. Staff at the front desk lack personable skills and do not fit in the hospitality business. It always seemed as if we were a bother to them from their socializing among other staff at the front. Secondly, each reservation were made with specific request for a king size bed and have failed to accommodate this simple request not once, not twice but at EVERY visit. Lastly, the accommodations in the room was below standards. This past visit was tragic as we were without hot water. We were annoyed to come back after a long day to a cold shower. In addition, the TV service on local stations kept freezing the screen or would constantly lose cable signal and disconnect.

I have to say that I do not normally take the time to write reviews eventhough I would like to I just never get around to it. But this is one I wanted to sit down and give a great review. Ok first off right when I got off the plane I found it very easy to take a shuttle to the Hotel. The shuttle service was wonderful picked me up and took us right to the Hotel. The customer service was excellent, every employee was so helpful and friendly. The rooms were so clean and nice. Really it had everything you would expect to have in a hotel room. I was very pleased and felt quite comfortable. The maid was very accommodating and very nice and would clean the room perfectly each day. I will recommend to stay in the highrise part of the hotel and not in the rooms on the outside perimeter. This is just my opinion of course. I did read reviews that said the Hotel noise level is very loud due to the surrounding airport and freeway traffic but I did not find it loud at all. We had a lovely sized room it was big and spacious with 2 beds and nice size closet and bathroom. My favorite part I know it's silly but was there complementary shampoos and conditioners. They smelled so good, very tropical and fruity. I usually bring or buy my own and am quite choosy in what I put in my hair but I loved and looked forward to using these every night. It conditioned my very tangled beached tossed hair which I was at first pretty sceptical. I even took some extra samples with me to our next hotel. Ok so here is the best part of the hotel (even though all the things I mentioned are still great), was the complimentary breakfast. Wow, what a breakfast buffet, each morning was a treat, they have so much food and an amazing variety to offer guest. My family's favorite was the individually fresh made waffles and fresh yogurt parfaits. We had an amazing waiter/ buffet server who greeted us with a friendly aloha every morning and made us yummy parfaits. So if looking for a place to stay keep this one on your list. It was so convenient for parking and right in the middle of Honolulu, close to freeway access and airport. Excellent stay than you Best Western Plaza",,Morgan B,0,5.0

We called the courtesy van upon collecting our bags and it arrived after about 15 minutes and took us to the hotel which was nice and close. Check in was quick and easy so were in our room within minutes. We were on the second floor facing the highway but there isn't an elevator for this part of the hotel so we had to haul a couple of very heavy suitcases up the stairs. The room was comfortable and functional, but the noise from the highway was pretty loud. I wouldn't normally be pleased about a loud airconditioner, but the noise from the A/C helped to drown out the noise from the highway. I did wake through the night a few times due to traffic noise. Aside from the noise and lack of stairs, it was a perfectly OK hotel for a fair price. The complimentary buffet breakfast in the morning was great, had all the basics and they were all done well. There is a gift shop/convenience store within the hotel which was handy for picking up some last minute souvenirs. The courtesy van runs every 30 minutes (on the hour and half hour) back to the airport so that made it easy to plan our check out time.

It's very convenient to the airport and the shuttle service was prompt to pick us up. It is also convenient to the Honolulu bus system that got us to Pearl Harbor in no time. The rooms are appropriate for a 3-star. We did not have any issues with interstate traffic noise (our room did not face the interstate) and the breakfast was great. However, the best thing happened when we were leaving....As a complimentary service, the hotel will hold your bags after you check out. We checked-out and visited Pearl Harbor. When we got back to the hotel, we get our bags and started to load into the airport shuttle. That's when my 9 year-old girl realizes she left her travel pillow on her hotel bed...We're tired after the day at Pearl Harbor, the long flight to Hawaii, and the new time zone. This is the straw that breaks the camel's back and my daughter starts crying over a travel pillow :(We ask if was returned to lost and found, but the housekeeping staff had already left for the day. I believe every manager in the hotel then mobilized to find that pillow. Some went to our room to look for it. Others were looking for the key to unlock the housekeeping room where lost/found items are kept. They were frantically trying to locate this travel pillow. By now, we had already held the shuttle up for 15 minutes. I told my daughter we're going to have to leave, but I'm sure they will find it and we can have them ship it to our house. She had tears coming to her eyes, but shook her head okay. Due to the roads at this location, the shuttle turns right and then makes a u-turn to get to the airport. After the u-turn, we're driving by the hotel when I see a manager holding the pillow up in the air and running after the shuttle in his dress shoes and tie. The driver gets on the radio with the manager who says he's getting in his car and will meet us at the airport terminal to deliver us the pillow. The driver unloads our bags but he won't leave. He tells us he's staying here so the manager will see the shuttle and know where we are.Five minutes later, the hotel manager pulls his car over and comes running over with the travel pillow. I try my best to give him a great tip in the middle of the airport drop-off, but he would not take it. He runs back to his car and shouts for me to give it to the driver. Just imagine if every hotel had that kind of dedication to customer service.","Huntsville, Alabama","Scott J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntsville, Alabama</strong>",2,5.0

After the 5 minute ride to the hotel, they greeted us by name and had our room key ready to go. Check-in took 1 minute. We hit the hay and awoke early for breakfast. It was buffet style; not super huge but just enough variety and the food was decent. We took the shuttle (every half hour) back to HNL in the morning to grab our car rental and head into Waikiki.

It is clearly an older property (probably 50+ years old) and while many finishes have been refreshed, the ambiance remains that of a mid-range 3-star hotel. Check-in was professional and efficient. Although we had reserved a standard king bed room, we were upgraded to a “deluxe” king room (a larger room at the corner of the building). Our room preferences had been noted and honored. That deluxe room was very spacious; the decor was comfortable rather than luxurious. There was a refrigerator, microwave, a small side chair and a desk with an adjustable chair, but no in-room safe. The bed was comfy with a thick, soft mattress pad. Lighting was abundant, as were electrical outlets. Highway noise from the Nimitz Freeway penetrated the single pane windows, however, even though our room was on a back corner of the building relatively far away from the freeway. For us, it was more of a background gray noise rather than an annoyance. The hotel is oriented perpendicular to the freeway so there are few rooms truly on the back of the building facing the airport (rooms 1217-1219 on our floor) but those rooms are directly across from the ice and vending machines (not enclosed in a separate room or alcove) which I’d consider to be a much greater noise problem than the freeway.The breakfast buffet was very good, including oatmeal and four cold cereals, scrambled eggs, pancakes and make-your-own waffles. The breakfast meat was unlabeled and were peculiarly dark cubes, possibly Spam. Seating was abundant. Fresh fruits included apples, oranges and melon but no bananas.A number of local and chain restaurants are within walking distance but nothing suggestive if fine dining. The surrounding neighborhood included a car dealer and light industrial buildings but felt safe for walking in the evening,The fitness center was relatively large with a variety of equipment. There is an outdoor pool, surrounded by additional low rise rooms (many of which could have problematic highway noise). The airport shuttle was efficient, but not quite free. I really dislike signage suggesting recommended tips, but there is one posted in the bus, suggesting a per-item tip. Bring lots of dollar bills, but don’t expect those tips to actually translate into meaningful assistance with handling your luggage.All in all: a good but not great hotel. The basics are solid (sleep quality, room features), and the included breakfast buffet is a big plus. It is a good choice for a short stay between flights.","Kihei, Hawaii","Peter G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kihei, Hawaii</strong>",135,3.0

The price though was a little high fo me 278 Us itax in and I booked as a Best western member. But when I logged into trip advisor to input the review. I noticed prices offered through trip advisor was almost half what I paid. Curious I entered numerous dates and never found the high price I paid for one night.

The main criticism was that there was a lot of road noise, as it is situated very close to the elevated Nimitz Highway and there is no double glazing to block the sound. We kept checking the windows to make sure they weren’t open as there was so much noise entering the room. We woke up to road noise quite a few times during the night.

Very easy to get to Waikiki, Pearl Harbor or North Shore. The bus system is excellent and a day pass is only $5.50- hotel restaurant food is delish and staff very friendly. We definitely looked forward to breakfast and dinner each day. - our room was super clean and freshly decorated- in-room coffee pod machine was great and provided a decent coffee. We did buy some fresh milk as they only had a dairy free powdered option in the room- the pool area was a good place to relax and get some sun.Cons- nothing drastic, the reception staff sometimes gave the impression that we were interrupting them when we approached the desk. They were mostly friendly but I think they were just super busy.- as this is an airport hotel, it can be a little noisy from the nearby freeways and airport. Being the plane nut I am, I didn't mind.

Close to the Navy Exchange & many good restaurants. For us, it was right in the middle of everything. Equal distance to every destination we went to, which was perfect. More importantly, it is located just about 15 minutes away from Tripler Hospital (which was the reason for our visit to Hawaii in the first place). The service we received at the hotel was good too. The room attendant, Amalia, was great with our housekeeping services. We always came back to an extra clean room. The hotel itself was great, but it was the first hotel I've been in that doesn't have balconies. But it's okay... it's safer for the kids that way. It's right next to the freeway & the airport, but the sound of the vehicles, bikes, planes & helicopters going by made it more interesting, most especially for my son. He's so used to hearing them back home, so he enjoys the sounds. Every time he heard a bike or helicopter go by, he'd push the chair to the window & just stare at it as it goes by.",,Camaryn A,0,5.0

The first time we stayed was for 45 days straight three years prior due to a military move. This hotel does so much to welcome the military and their families to the island. They not only give you free parking for the TLA program, but also meal credits for the onsite restaurant. Our second stay was this one for 10 days as we are moving away from the island. Imagine our surprise when upon walking into the restaurant for dinner the first night, we were greeted by a hug from Techi, who remembered us from three years prior! The staff at the restaurant for our first visit was amazing and they continued to be for this stay as well. James, Michael, Techi, and Ramon in the restaurant all remembered our family from the three years prior and greeted us like we were long time friends. It blew us away that they remembered us!The food in the restaurant is great and well priced. The breakfast offers very large portions, as well as the dinner! The menu has changed a bit from what we remember but everything was delicious. I have worked in the hotel industry for several years and this is great food at a great price for Oahu standards. The rooms are nice and clean, and I believe they may have been updated since our last stay. Our housekeeper ( Zeniada?) was always sweet and cleaned our room with great attention to detail. We will always recommend this hotel to friends moving to the island. Everyone at the property greets you kindly and genuinely feels like they care about you. the property does have small issues, like the parking being tight and it being a bit noisy from the highway noise.

More than one day disappeared because of a surprise nap. - Our TV was upgraded from a 36in to a 55in, which was super nice. - The refrigerator and microwave were standard sizes for a hotel. - The bathroom had one vanity and bathtub that was just a little too shallow for a nice relaxing bath. - The pool area was rarely crowded and had a decent size. Chairs and Tables and clean water. But quite a few ants...- Complementary WiFi allowed for four devices. Which for two technologically immersed people is about half as many as we needed.- The location was fairly convenient. Hickam is about an hour walk or 8 min drive, and the Pearl Harbor NEX was about the same.- The floor would get wet whenever it rained, which I found really weird. - Parking was free for guests, and the garage is floors two through five, with six through twelve for the rooms.- There were two elevators, and no choice to use the stairs. There was no service elevator, and the two elevators they did have were slow. Especially at rush hour.- There are four washing machines and four dryers on the first floor, but they are $3.25 per load, each. - There was a free gym on the twelfth floor. It's not real big, but there are some free weights and one bench, two treadmills, and some other things.- On Tues, Wed, and Thurs, the restaurant is closed, and guests are directed to Airport Honolulu Hotel's restaurant, which is honestly better.

Unfortunately I had to wait at least 20 minutes for the shuttle even though I used the special phone in the baggage area and was told it would only be five minutes. I had to go back and make another call and was told the shuttle driver was busy dropping people off and was on his way. Going back to the airport was quick and easy since they don’t have other hotels they need to stop at. Most of the people I saw walking around the hotel were wearing military uniforms since it is near Pearl Harbor rather than close to other tourist sites. It is a very standard older hotel but my room was spacious and the bathroom was clean with a hot shower. The beds were comfortable and the air-conditioning worked great! I was wiped out from an overnight flight and was so grateful they had a clean room for me just after 10 am when the housekeeping staff showed up. Even though the black-out curtains were difficult to arrange and I had to use clothespins to keep them shut, I managed a nap. The planes weren’t too bothersome and there wasn’t a huge amount of street noise despite the nearness of the freeways. The location is very industrial so I can’t say much for the view. My other complaint is the lack of free breakfast and the very limited restaurant hours. The fact that they didn’t even serve dinner the night I was there was a problem for me because there are only a handful of small restaurants close by. My experience with the staff was positive—someone even brought me an extra blanket right away when I called the front desk late at night!

This is so they can rip off the government by charging a rate near your TLA limit. When I explained that I would be paying out of my own pocket he gave me a lower rate to include (pet fee, parking and tax). When I checked in the military liaison seemed surprised and confused at the rate he gave me. After explaining myself again he decided to change my rate to exclude pet/parking/taxes costing 16% more. Not having another place for my family to stay I felt trapped and forced to accept the new terms. Upon checking in I learned, the hotel allows a local homeless man with an apparent mental health instability to wander the lobby, courtyard, and mini mart to make purchases. We shortened our stay from 10 nights to one leaving the next day. Changing the terms of our reservation is unacceptable, especially when your family is in the middle of a PCS move.

The beds were kind of small (full size), but, hey, there were 2 of them, so we each had a bed! And they were comfortable. Loved the sheets!

The most annoying thing about the place was the traffic noise, which I started to notice as I was laying in bed, in the dark, at 5:00AM (my bio clock thought it was 8:00 o’clock because of time difference). But I did not notice it at all the night before when I went to bed at 10:00PM, because my body thought it was 1:00AM and ready to sleep.

The pet rooms are incredibly tiny, as a family of 4 our space was limited to say the least. The ""pet friendly"" rooms are also right next to H1 and the noise kept our cat extremely nervous and jumpy. We were given ear plugs at check in to combat the noise for ourselves. While we made this doable for the week we needed to stay, our biggest issue arose when our bathroom ceiling (which already had obvious patchwork) began pouring water from the ceiling. Water from holes now formed, from our ventilation fan, and from the heating light inside the shower. It was coming from our upstairs neighbor, and when notified maintenenaces solution was to have them turn their tub off. We were told to go about business as nornak and not given an option to move rooms, despite being an obvious electrical and health/air quality issue due to mold. If you are given a typical room in the tower, yes I would recommend this property as a conveniently located hotel, near the airport and BED among other locations.If you are looking for a pet friendly option, I would not put money towards a room here as it was fairly miserable at best.

My travel clock had broken and I have no faith in my ability to set hotel radio/alarm clocks. He repeatedly reassured me that I would receive the call and even showed me that he was writing down my request.Needless to say, no wake-up call. I woke at 6:30, grabbed my luggage and flew downstairs only to be told that the next hotel shuttle to the airport would not leave for another 30 minutes. I told the driver that I did not get my promised wake-up call, I'd already loaded my luggage BY MYSELF into the shuttle and I needed to be taken to the airport now! I guess the driver noticed the smoke coming out of my ears, took pity on me and drove me to the airport.After clearing Agriculture Inspection (long lines), United bag check (long lines), TSA (long lines) and then running through the airport I made it onto the plane as the last to board. The main reason for staying at this hotel is its proximity to the airport, its 24-hour airport shuttle and promise of a wake-up call.

There was the opportunity to catch a bus into Waikiki for $2.50 each way and a stop right outside the hotel, but we knew we were coming back for longer in a weeks time so we didn't do that. We did walk to a shopping centre (about 40 mins) close to Pearl Harbour (Moanalua Shopping Centre) to go to the AT&T outlet to buy a sim for our phones that gave us unlimited data, text and calls in the USA which proved to be a godsend for our travelling to NYC and back to Hawaii for over 2 weeks. The staff there couldn't have more helpful. We also had lunch tat the shopping village and walked back. The restaurant at the hotel was great. The staff were very engaging and the meals beautiful.

For me it did not make a lot of sense to incur the added expense of booking and getting to a hotel in Waikiki this particular late night. This hotel provided the perfect alternative. When I arrived I was able to call the hotel for their shuttle who was already there picking up other passengers which worked out more than perfect for me. No hassle of getting a rental car or paying for parking when it has already been a long and tiring day. The next morning I was able to walk to the rental car agency and get my North Shore adventures started early. Keep in mind the hotel is in the industrial part of the city and there is nothing of interest for a tourist close by. However, the rooms were recently updated and clean and the front desk and shuttle guy extremely courteous and helpful. While I would not base my entire vacation here I would definitely use them for those later night flights where airport convenience is paramount.

Dont carry credit cards so am familiar with the need to often pay a cash deposit when i check in. I was paying about $140 room/tax rate yet the hotel demanded a $350 cash deposit. As the stay went on i ran ouf of cash and the hotel refused to use the cash held as deposit toward the room & tax. I had an advance for the 5 night's room and tax plus a modest cash deposit. Third day into my stay i was forced to check out as i didn't have cash for that night's room and tax. My deposit was more than 2x the nightly rate so i asked them to take it from my deposit on hold. They said no even though they still had more than enough left over in my deposit to pay even my last night with cash left over. I was waiting for a bank transfer from my new employer and i was waiting for employer to complete a creditcard authorization for the hotel's charges. None of that mattered to the hotel, the desk clerk asked the wrong question to the manager on duty and would not let me speak to the manager directly. The manager said i needed cash for room and tax and refused to use any of the deposit otherwise i must leave. So with no choice i was escorted to my room by security, hastily packed my suitcases and checked out. Ironically, once i had my deposit back i had enough to pay for 3 nights room and tax. !!!

Old windows in the hotel were very thin so all the noise from the jets taking off to the very busy highway in front of the hotel made it difficult to sleep. It was even more difficult to sleep because our window was off its track and could n't be fixed because it was bolted in place. So even more noise was coming in because the window was open to the outside world. There are very few options for eating in the area and we happened to be there on a night that their restaurant was closed. Something they don't tell you online is that their restaurant is closed several days a week and you have to go down to their sister hotel for a meal.

Whatever you do or no matter how low the rate is do not book a room here-even if it is free. If your airline tries to make you stay here tell then no & get a different hotel (or just stay at the airport)We got stuck in this dump because our flight was canceled and this is where Allegiant stuck us. Our stay here started with walking to our rooms, sprinklers were on & housekeeping had their cart on the sidewalk (taking up the whole sidewalk) so we had to walk with all of our luggage through the sprinklers to get to our room.We got 2 rooms on the bottom floor, rooms 126 & 127. Room 127 smelled horribly, like a mixture of mold & cigarette smoke with maybe a smidgen of wet dog. Room 126 seemed better at 1st, it smelled better. It definitely had a cheap motel feel but it was what we were stuck with so we decided to make the best of it, we got settled & let the kids look around. That is when we found a giant cockroach by the pool-although I was somewhat fascinated-it was the 1st cockroach I've ever seen, I was also very grossed out, it felt dirty. Then we discovered rat traps a few feet away from room 126's door, also a giant moth waiting just above our heads walking to our 2nd room. My husband noticed snails on the side of the building. The sound of the highway was so loud each room had 2 sets of ear plugs in the room for you to use. We decided to leave for a bit to go get a bite to eat.When we came back there was a cockroach IN the room that smelled ok. We talked to the lady @ the front desk & her only reply was ""Oh, that's a big one"" Apparently cockroaches are a normal thing here. She would only change one of our rooms so we got a room on the top floor (room 1202) and then they kicked us out of the other room we had to keep(room 126) for hours so they could spray some sort of pesticide(apparently housekeeping does that here). Seriously. All of this and we have only been at this hotel a few hours......who knows what joys the night will bring. Wish us luck and please save yourselves and DO NOT STAY HERE! (a bit more expensive but I suggest the Aston Waikiki Beach Tower)P.S. If I could have given The Best Western Plaza Hotel no stars than I would have.Update: room 1202: while housecleaning knows how to spray for roaches they apparently don't know how to clean. There is hair all over the bathroom and other little bits of garbage as well. The ""clean"" sheets are nasty....I'm not sure if they are dirty or stained (pics attached of bed 1 & bed 2). I can't say anyone in the top floor room really slept last night-we were too busy hoping cockroaches would not come running out from under stuff.....good news we didn't see any up here. The rest of us in room 126 (the room we got kicked out of for a few hours so they could spray for roaches) survived the night. The guys were busy making jokes about the cockroaches giving them massages last night and carrying them to the shuttle bus this morning, so we really are trying to make the best of it but really save yourself the headache & stay elsewhere.","Osage, Iowa","kamaae</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Osage, Iowa</strong>",78,1.0

After flying for 23 hours and missing the final connection from Honolulu to Maui I was dead tired and still couldn't sleep. That's how bad it was. To add insult to injury, the airline refused to pay for the stay since the delay that caused me to misconnect was due to weather so I had to pay out of my pocket at a supposed discounted rate of $150. Way too high for this hotel, especially since I was there all of 5 hours as I checked in shortly after midnight and was up and out on the 5:30 AM shuttle. On the bright side, however, looks can be deceiving as I expected it to be a fleabag based on the exterior and lobby, but the room was very modern, the linens and towels were fresh and seemed to be fairly new and the room was spotlessly clean. The bed was comfortable but the air conditioning unit runs constantly and there's no way to adjust the temperature which wasn't good on an unusually cool night, especially since there's no blankets. The woman at the front desk was extremely efficient and pleasant at check-in and the shuttle to the airport was spot on every 30 minutes. So, as the title suggests, the hotel has quite a few positives, but price and location are major negatives since, in this case, you don't get what you're paying for at this price point. But, if you're stuck without a rental car, like I was, and must spend a night or two, ask for a room away from Nimitz Highway, the major thoroughfare.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","romadaro</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",1056,3.0

As others suggested, I called the hotel upon my arrival, but the lack of signage at the airport for a well defined pick-up point made it difficult -- the shuttle just zoomed by and it was not easy to spot the van, especially for someone who just stumbled out of the Baggage Claim area in a strange airport, at night.On the other hand, catching a shuttle from the hotel to the airport was no problem , as it did leave on-time every 30 minutes.The hotel itself is dated. The air control was iffy and the air flow was harsh. The shower head was sub-par. But I was thankful for a clean place to rest overnight, and the Internet (unsecured) connection worked well .On my return visit, I did get an early check-in (without charge) when I arrived around noon, but the desk clerk made it clear that it was a privilege for which I should be thankful. (I checked out at 5:30 AM the next day.)You can catch a bus going in town at a stop a short walk from the front of the hotel.

Paid €175 room only (approx $196 at time of booking) on the internet.So, what did we get for the money? First off they have a shuttle bus which runs to and from the airport every half hour BUT they only pick up on request by phone, either cell phone or phones in baggage claim area. Had to wait 25 minutes for pick up.The decor in the hotel is a drab yellow and totally uninviting. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean and the staff on reception polite and friendly. An hotel of this size should have a restaurant. It does but only on the weekend and Monday. To eat you on other days there is fast food a block away or you can take the shuttle bus which will drop you at a sister hotel where you can eat and charge the bill to your room. You are tied, of course, to the shuttle bus schedule. To return to your hotel you have to wait for that hotel's shuttle bus to take you back. This arrangement is annoyingly inconvenient, obviously done to cut costs and not for the convenience of the customer. Our room was on the eighth floor, level with the flyover on the Nimitz Highway and the windows are not double glazed so the noise level was high at all times.

The overhead freeway provides shelter for several transients who frequent the Hotel shop for alcohol. I was there for business in Wahiawa so this was the closest I could get.

They really have an awesome staff. My low rating is really because of the dated hotel along with the price you pay. I've stayed at many best westerns and have loved all of them except this one. It is not because it's not clean because the hotel is actually really clean. It's because it's dated and looks a little run down. Seems like with the amount of money that is made, they could do some renovations.Most hotels here in Hawaii are expensive but many of them ( especially downtown are renovated and look great and around the same price) The other downfall is the bed situation. The beds are full size beds ( not queens) they do have king size beds but with no pull our sleeper sofa option. My husband lift weights and is built with broad shoulders and big arms. It's so hard sleeping in a tiny full size bed comfortably. We couldn't get king size bedroom bc there was no additional sleeping arrangements for my kids unless we purchased another room that conjoined ours. . At 230+ a night that was out of the question. The rooms are a decent size and being that the hotel is about a block from the airport the noise level is low and I can barely hear them of any at all. Bathrooms are a little small but manageable. Parking is insane here and very tight but that is the norm for this area. Food: the restaurant in the hotel is decent. I like the breakfast and have tried many of the menu options. Dinner is good depending on what is ordered. Now for military personnel this hotel has a wonderful liaison that has put together an awesome program and package for military. They offer things that no other hotel will do for military and their families. I would consider coming back to this hotel bc of the staff. If renovations were made I would 100% come back and stay with this best western. ","Clarksville, Tennessee","278amberc21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clarksville, Tennessee</strong>",17,3.0

We were greeted by cordial, affable receptionists who were able to efficiently check us in. Make sure to be a Best Western rewards member-- the points add up! From the front desk, a welcoming bell-hop was able to help us into our room with our heavy loads of luggage-- don't forget to tip! I've heard of the hotel offering a promissory note to military using TLA, but this is not the case for outbound families as we are. We were told that is only available for inbound. Either way, it wasn't a big deal. We paid upfront for all 11 nights and are able to pick up the receipt early, showing a zero balance, to take back to our command to begin the reimbursement process.We were given $30 ($10/person) in meal ticket vouchers for the cafe per day. Four nights a week, meals are offered here in the downstairs of this hotel. On Tuesday-Thursday, it is served at their sister hotel down the road. A free shuttle offers transportation and leaves from the lobby every 30 minutes. Breakfast and dinner are served daily-- no lunch. It's casual, sit-down dining and I'd say the average meal costs about $13 or so. You can order as cheap or as pricey as you want. You will be left to pay the remaining difference as well as tip. The portions are very generous and taste about average. My favorite so far has been the spaghetti bolognese and my husband's is the fettuccine chicken alfredo; both are served with garlic toast. There is a mini-mart located downstairs next to the lobby as well selling anything from souvenir T's to ice cream sandwiches. We are in a deluxe King, corner-room suite. The bed isn't our Tempur-pedic, but very comfortable, none the less, and the bedding is very soft. The AC works great for those coming from AC-less housing in town like us! Our room features large windows with views of the airport, Diamond Head, and the ocean in the far distance. Our room is the biggest I've ever stayed in... it's HUGE. Even with 3 large suitcases sprawled out and many other bags, we still have plenty of room to walk around and for my 6 month old to crawl and play. We also have a microwave, mini fridge, cable TV, dresser drawers, cabinet space, and the bathroom is a decent size; featuring a large vanity, and bathtub with shower head. The housekeeping staff has been helpful, attentive, and always very accommodating to our needs. Mercy and Emerita have been taking care of us and are exceptional! Anytime we need extra towels or trash taken care of (so many diapers with an infant), they are there to immediately meet our needs in the friendliest way possible. They were also able to provide a crib in our room upon time of arrival. Parking in the garage is free, just bring in your ticket to the lobby for validation. Also, the free wifi is great and has given us zero problems. Connecting is simple and you're allowed up to 4 devices. There are USB charging ports built right into the table, which is wonderfully convenient. Side note, we don't personally have pets, but I do know they are allowed! Another perk, is the pool! It's never crowded and there's towels poolside as well as tables and loungechairs. The hotel's location isn't bad either. It's not in the middle of Waikiki's hustle and bustle and close enough to basically anywhere you'd like to go. Very convenient Honolulu location. Less than 10 minutes to Pearl Harbor. As far as nearby food, there is a Micky D's within walking distance as well as a Starbucks like 3 minutes away. Next to Starbucks is Blimpie's subs, Ninja Sushi (order the Superman roll!), and Big Kahuna's (the BEST garlic cheese balls, everything is made to order)-- and cash only, ATM located outside! I honestly cannot say enough good things about this place. It may not be a resort, but I don't think anyone coming here is expecting that. For what's it's worth, our stay has already exceeded our expectations.

No, it's not a resort, but you aren't on vacation, you are trying to find a place to live and get out of there. McDonald's is right behind the hotel, and although I am personally not a fan, I can see how this would be very convenient for many families. Also walk-able are a Starbucks, jamba juice, ninja sushi and some other quick lunch type places. The restaurant in the hotel is good. Nothing crazy, but you can get a good solid meal here. You can easily score an uber or lyft to take you anywhere in town that you would like to go. It cost us about $15 to get into Waikiki and enjoy all the perks of the Hale Koa and other resorts. Here is a tip, in order to use the ""resort"" at Hale Koa, all you need is a military ID. I believe you can also park for free with your military ID. So if you are feeling deprived of the resort experience, just head on over there and enjoy the pools, beach, etc. The best thing is that this hotel actually caters to you as a family on TLA. You will book through Les, who is the military coordinator. He is passionate about providing a good experience for those of us who have just completed an overseas move. The rate you will be charged is calculated so that including tax it will total the TLA rate. No extra out of pocket. Additionally, parking fees and pet fees are waived. Parking is meant to be $30/night and pets $30/night per pet. The waiving of these fees saved my family $90/night. The pet policy for military is literally any pet up to 500lbs. We had our two larger dogs and it was comfortable. If you have pets, you will stay in the courtyard which is well appointed with grassy areas and poop-bag stands. The only downside to this is that there is no elevator for those staying on the second floor. It was an extra challenge to get all of our stuff in, but you make it work. If you don't have pets, you stay in the main tower and I believe you get other perks like meal vouchers to use at the restaurant. We had to attend a one hour meeting explaining all of this, which was kind of a drag, but there was free pizza and it was worth it to keep all of the perks (free parking etc). During the meeting I learned that the hotel will even give you a ""promissory note"" if you can not afford to pay out of pocket before being reimbursed TLA. I feel like this could be a big deal to some families, and is unheard of in this day and age at any other place. Additionally, the staff here is SUPER nice and accommodating. Always smiling and kind. The gym is decent. There were two treadmills, but one was broken during our stay. Also a universal gym, free weights, an elliptical, stationary bike, and medicine balls. It worked for me and I never had to wait for the one treadmill that was working. The view is pretty cool as the gym is on the top floor.

We had quite a rough start but because of the calm and caring efforts of the employees, the bump in the road eventually got worked out.The room was clean and, despite some major disrepair and wear and tear throughout the room and bathroom, it was nothing so disgusting that it would scare someone away. However, don’t expect anything about the room or facility to be in the modern or appealing décor. The room was dated, the hallway not inviting, and this establishment is in desperate need of renovation, as other reviews have noted. If you want modern, updated, no disrepair showing, then choose another motel as this one is not for you. For the extremely budget conscious family, they might make the effort to make a stay here worth it but that is a highly personal decision. It is also very noisy due to the major highways just outside the facility. The motel we were told was here first, but then came the highway that was placed right outside their front door. If you get a room on the side of the freeway, it seems it would be quite difficult to sleep. Even the room we were assigned on the backside of the motel is significantly noisy but tolerable. It seems it would hold true, as other reviews have noted, to get a room on an upper floor and preferably one not facing the highway.There is a restaurant but when it’s not open, the restaurant at their sister-facility just a bit down the road is open and they alternate the days each are open and closed. The free shuttle will pick-up and return guests on the days their facility’s restaurant is closed. For breakfast, the restaurant does not open until 6:30 a.m., which frankly, even for us ended up being too late to meet our need since we needed to catch an early flight. The time they open seems a bit too late because this facility caters to those needing to catch a flight and the military who are being stationed in Hawaii. Also, their free motel shuttle only provides rides to and from the airport every half hour and runs 24 hours. The shuttle drivers were also extremely efficient, helpful, and friendly. Do consider leaving a daily gratuity for housekeeping. They work so hard to keep the guests comfortable and the room clean and tidy. Just a couple of dollars always shows them that the guest appreciated their efforts. While traveling over the years, I’ve talked to many housekeepers and they work diligently and rarely get recognition for the effort from the guests. We’ve always carried the motto that “no one is going to clean up our mess” and we make every effort to help housekeeping out by making the room as easy to clean as possible such as gathering all the towels into one place, throwing away trash, keeping the floor and the room free of our belongings being tossed around the room, etc., and upon our exit we make a point to throw all soaps and other used amenities in the trash, saving the housekeeper from having to clean up after us.","Monroe, Michigan","Vacationers2007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monroe, Michigan</strong>",118,3.0

There is a restaurant that is open for breakfast and closes at 10:30AM I believe. The food is really good, at a tourist price. Average about $15 for breakfast. I rented a room in this hotel because it is closest to my parents house (as opposed to Waikiki)... a room at Waikiki was actually a little less expensive. We are talking about ""location"". I live on Oahu, so I was thinking, if I was a tourist and got stuck overnight at the airport and had to be at the airport early, then of course, I would choose to stay at the Best Western by the airport. BUT, if my flight got cancelled and I had to make a decision to enjoy Waikiki one more night and could arrive at the airport late the next day, then I would choose to stay in Waikiki.

There are rooms located inside the main hotel; however, we stayed in the outer rooms located around the pool. We requested this room because of medical purposes. The area is ridden with transients and there is no real barrier between the public and the outside rooms, which all have sliding glass doors. The transients had to be shooed away many times and it creates an uneasy feeling at night. There was an incident one day where my son and I left the pool are because a man was smoking meth in the parking lot. The front desk never answers the phone, so be prepared to constantly walk up front. Towels are supposed to be supplied at the pool; however, they go quickly. Both times I asked the front desk clerk for pool towels I was met with a quick, rude response - ""They're outside."" Of course they were not. Why else would I walk the extra 50 feet to ask you? My husband had just returned from the hospital from major surgery. I waited at the front desk and said excuse me twice to ask where I could find an ice machine. After the second time the clerk huffed and complained I made her lose her count. It's as though we were asking too much for simple requests. The room also had occasional roaches, which is normal when palm trees are nearby. I do know a tree/palmetto roach from a german roach though. When I ask for pest control, the clerk attempted to inform me that roaches are common. Yes, I'm well aware; however, I just killed four and found one in my bed and they surely weren't tree or water roaches. There is a ""dining area"" inside the main lobby; however, breakfast is ala carte and dinner is only served fri-mon. Tues-Thurs you must walk to their nearby location for a meal. There is a gift shop i the lobby that is quite convenient if you're willing to overpay for convenience. The perks were the not-so-crowded pool, lobby gift shop, proximity to airport, and friendly housekeeping. Luz is amazing. Very respectful, courteous, and helpful and never made you feel as though you were inconveniencing her for asking for anything at all. If hotels near the Waikiki strip are booked or over $300/night, I could say stay here, but I recommend looking at something on the strip such as the Hale Koa, Embassy Suites, Marriott if you're expecting a more Hawaiian experience.

She gave advice for meals and great directions for 3 tired travelers that had never been in Hawaii. The restaurant is great for breakfast. The entire staff is wonderful and attentive. Unfortunately the dinner chefs leave much to be desired. I ordered pork chops which were lovely. However the sides at $7 each were terrible. I ordered the 'garlic smashed potatoes'. I received a dozen baby potatoes in grease. When I explained to the waiter that for $7 a side this was not what I expected. He graciously took them back to the kitchen. He returned 1 minute later with the same potatoes with what looked to be someones fist print in them. I guess at the Best Western Hulk Smash potatoes. Again, tonight as I am a glutton for punishment and a lover of pork I ordered the same dish and received the same baby potatoes devoid of salt, pepper, garlic, butter, chives, and even a hint of sour cream. I offered to make the dish for the chef. I asked to have the potatoes reheated, a dollop of butter, salt, pepper, two tablespoons of sour cream, chives and bacon bits but they would not let me make that order. They could not find my credit receipt and so I paid $7 for a container of cold, raw potatoes that were left at the cashier stand. I did not get recompense but did suggest that the chef use the baby potatoes as suppositories. Cashier actually googled 'smashed potatoes' when I pointed out the difference she said, 'Those are regular smashed potatoes, not garlic smashed potatoes. I would not be so upset but the initial knuckle prints in the first batch of 'garlic smashed potatoes' shows an arrogance and distain that does not belong in customer service.

I chose it because it is located very close to the airport. The hotel has a high rise building and a motel-like building. My room was in the (dated) motel-like building, with rooms that open up to the outdoors (no hallway like you'd have in a hotel). My room was on the second floor. With no elevator, it was very difficult lugging our large luggage up the stairs. Also, the room faced a parking area that is adjacent to a small city street. I had a difficult time resting in the room for a few reasons. One reason is that, at some point during the night, the a/c stopped blowing cooled air and instead emitted air that was as muggy as the room. Another reason, there was noise coming from the parking area (voices from people) at late hours of the night. Additionally, the water in the toilet kept running (the kind of sound you'd hear right after flushing when the water level is getting back to normal). At one point (say at about 4 am), I began counting the number of minutes between the quiet and a new round of water noise--- not more than 10 minutes apart!Finally, the most annoying thing during my stay was the noise from the onslaught of municipal and vendor trucks that seemed to come around every 30 minutes from around 4 am throughout the morning. At first, I thought the sound was from a street sweeping truck. I accepted it and figured it would be gone and then I go back to sleep. But not long after the first bit of truck noise, I heard the loud beeping sound of a truck backing up. I am certain that I heard at least 5 different trucks come through with loud back-up beeping sounds. Perhaps they were vendors unloading supplies for the hotel??? I have no idea but it was very noisy and very early in the morning. Surprisingly, my husband was able to sleep through all the noise.

The staff that made my family feel at home include Mr. Les, Mrs. Beau, Ms. Lan, and Mr. James. Me and my family have no issues with the hotel and I would definitely stay here every time. The staff here are very professional and have alot of information that the guess can use. To think about it, I don't feel like a guess here at all.

The negatives included: no elevators to all floors, noisy rooms, since it is near a big highway, and limited pool hours. Take bug spray for pool time at dawn or dusk.
