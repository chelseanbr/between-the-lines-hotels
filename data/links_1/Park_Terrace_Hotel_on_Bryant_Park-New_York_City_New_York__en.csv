Staff was friendly and our Deluxe Room well maintained and sufficient in terms of size.One of two elevators was not working for several days. This was kind of annoying cause you had to wait a long time getting to the top floors. Anyhow, I guess this was a one time problem We liked the free water service on the floor and the option that we could get mail delivered to the hotel. What we didn't like too much was the breakfast system.They only offer very limited seating - so every day the room was so crowded that we either took a breakfast box to the room or had to wait a long time for a table. As there was no order in who gets a table people were literally fighting for places.As well they don't offer a typical breakfast menuEveryrhing is good - but not what your used to.No fried or scrambled egg but rather bagless with cream cheese. Several sausages, boiled egg and fruits. We would have rather had a classical buffet incl pancakes and French toast / baked beans.

So what did we need from the room - great bed, room size more than adequate for two adults travelling for 1 week. Bathroom good with a great shower. Amenities exceptional (big TV, bluetooth speaker, water stations, amenity cupboard, air con, in room Nespresso all were great) but the ABSOLUTE best was the breakfast - bagels, breads, toppings, cereals, juice, tea and coffee - delicious and a great way to start each days adventures - stayed for 6 nights and was well above what we needed for a very reasonable price.","Winchester, United Kingdom","RichardJ1021</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winchester, United Kingdom</strong>",2,5.0

Settled on Park Terrace as a result of trip Advisor reviews. We arrived the Sunday before presidents day for 3 nights. The staff were excellent throughout. Really welcoming and friendly. The room was immaculate and the bed extremely comfortable. The hotel is in a great location and is within a 5-10 minute walk of Empire State Building and Times Square, and even closer to 5th Ave and Grand Central Station. We spent very little time in the hotel as we were out the whole time, but I would happily return. We did have a few drinks in the bar one late afternoon. Atmosphere was lovely with a gas fire. There's also a terrace with igloos. If I could say anything negative at all, it would just be that breakfast can be really busy. We had to wait for a table every morning, only for a few minutes, but it did mean that I almost felt rushed to leave as I could see other people waiting for a table.

Check in process was welcoming, quick and effortless. Our room was absolutely spot on, we had the suite so we had a huge bed which has to be the comfiest bee I have ever slept on, bathroom was spacious and light and the shower was super powerful. The hotel give out expensive hand wash etc but I can’t remember the brand. In the suite you also get tons of snacks and drinks, huge tv, sofa, dining table, Bose sound system and two balcony’s over looking Bryant Park. If you stay here you have to try the breakfast it’s not like your normal hotel breakfast everything is sourced locally and it’s like your traditional New York breakfast so plenty of good coffee, bagels, hams, cheeses, nuts, fruits etc plus they have igloos outside on the terrace if you fancy it. Only thing I will say about the breakfast is try and go early as at busy times there can be a big queue. Overall the hotel was a bit more pricier than the other almost 1000 hotels to pick from in New York but when you had a faultless experience and hotel was perfect it makes it worth it.

The concierge was well staffed and well presented. Always smiling and happy to answer the multitude of questions we threw at them. Minimalist but no fuss. The location is excellent. Easy access to many of NY’s sights and sounds. A short walk to the metro. We had a room with a view towards the library and Bryant Park with its ice rink. There was also a small Juliet balcony which was great as it meant we could occasionally let in some crisp fresh air. The room is a reasonable size by NY standards and was exceptionally clean and well maintained. The bed was comfortable and we slept well. Complementary filtered water with reusable bottles and self serve ice was available in the lift area.As noted in other reviews, the lifts can be slow, but we just used the stairs (make sure you get into the correct stairwell to exit to the foyer). This was definitely easier during breakfast hours and to get to and from the breakfast level. At check in, would it make sense to make people aware of the stairs to give them an alternative to the lifts, if they wished to use them?The continental breakfast has a wide selection of different items which would cover most needs. A particular positive here is that there are takeaway boxes for you to stash away something for a morning snack. The fact that this was clearly pointed out as an acceptable thing to do on our first entry to breakfast was refreshing. Subsequently, we would take a bagel (which were superb) and doughnut away with us for an on-the-go treat. The breakfast is the same each morning. It would be an even better experience if there was some variation each day for those staying longer than one or two nights. On a downside, the layout of the breakfast space meant a constant choke point causing a relatively long queue for one end of the breakfast bar. There is also not enough tables and chairs for all to be easily accommodated. The space would benefit from a reworking of the way in which breakfast is served. Main issue though is that a decent coffee is an additional charge which just feels a bit greedy. I did order a barista coffee on the first day and it appeared as though what I asked for got lost in translation so didn’t bother again.The breakfast counter doubles as the drinks bar in the evening. We briefly visited the bar on our first night but there was a private function using a quarter of the space and it felt a bit awkward to come in and sit and relax. There are some heated igloos out on the rooftop but we did not get time to use them but they looked like a bit of fun.Interestingly, we got an email along the lines of “How is your stay, would you like to review?” My wife completed the review including a response to a question indication a small fridge in the room would be nice. Literally, immediately after hitting the submit button the phone in our room rang with someone advising they do have small fridges available would we like one brought up to the room!”. You could view this as either exceptional service or a bit creepy. Either way, lucky we had a great time or our response could have been a bit awkward. Incidentally, five minutes later a small fridge did appear which, for us, falls into the great service category .Overall, 4 bubbles is a bit harsh. Issues highlighted did not really impact on our stay. Would definitely be 5 bubbles if resolved. We really enjoyed our stay and will be likely to stay here again when we visit NY again.","Sydney, Australia","Essexboy999</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",121,4.0

The location of this newly constructed hotel is perfect -- the hotel overlooks Bryant Park and is within an easy walking distance to several major sites (Times Square, Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, Madison Square Garden, Empire State Building, etc). While nestled in the middle of the city that never sleeps, I was surprised to find my room was very quiet as it overlooked the park. Compared to other hotel rooms I've experienced in NYC, my room at Park Terrace was spacious enough for my mother and me to both comfortably recharge after a busy day of working and sightseeing. The room was very clean and the staff was exceptionally hospitable and welcoming from the moment we stepped through the door. Now for my favorite part -- the breakfast buffet!!! This was by far the nicest breakfast buffet I've had in the city. It was so good that my mother and I canceled our brunch plans and ate at the hotel both mornings of our stay! While you can get coffee at the breakfast buffet, my mother wanted me to mention in my review that the room has a nice Nespresso coffee maker (I'm not a coffee drinker, but apparently Nespressos are the real deal!) Whether you're in NYC for business or pleasure (my stay was both), I highly recommend staying at Park Terrace Hotel if you value hospitality, comfort and cleanliness!

First attempt was transferred to reservations and waited 10 mins so I hung up. Second attempt was an hour later and it took 45 mins with the girl to make two reservations because she put me on hold for 5 mins to find out how big the rooms were. So after 45 mins she assured me she would send two separate emails. I received one but did not receive the second one. So after an hour I emailed Hotel to remind them I am still waiting for the 2nd confirmation.The first email response was it was sent. I explained I only have one not two confirmations.The second email response was that there's only one reservation to which I explained for the second time that there should be two!!!The third email response from them was to call them to which I responded I am not going to call and indicated already that they should be calling me (as I am NOT wasting my dime on LD charges when I already wasted 45 mins in LD charges). At which time I simply asked them to cancel reservations as this experience from booking to now the customer experience was terrible.Of course, my last email asking for confirmation that my reservation is cancelled and confirmation that they only have one and that I will not be charged for any reservations goes unanswered. If this is any indication of how this hotel's customer service is then its certainly not a hotel others should consider.","Toronto, Canada","RichardH28</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,1.0

Eventually I managed to find a tiny table where to have breakfast.As for the food, quite a major disappointment: besides a boiled egg, there is no egg option (benedict, scrambled, omelette... nothing). There is the choice of rye, toast and croissant bread, and the muffins. One type of cereal and muesli, and plain yogurt. Some fruits, and only filtered coffee, which didn't taste good.

There is so much to love. It is, however, a pretty big drawback for me that there is not a real restaurant at the hotel with room service options. Otherwise, I would be giving a full 5-star rating. I particularly love the lighting in the hotel rooms with all lights being fully dimmable / adjustable. I also really love the free water bottle refill station. This saves me tons of money & helps reduce environmental waste. The Terazzo bar has quality light bites and drinks and an excellent free breakfast. All in all a great hotel at a great value in a great location. One last small critique is the entrance. For a hotel entrance, it is not very user friendly for guests traveling with suitcases -- which is all of us, right? The doors do not automatically open and are quite heavy. There is usually not a door person to get the door for you. If that weren't a bit difficult as it were, also the entryway has a floor that is not conducive to rolling luggage, so trying to manage the door while bringing your luggage in at the same time can be a bit challenging.",Santa Rosa Beach,"Daydream586463</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Rosa Beach</strong>",1,4.0

After 2 hours of agonizing ride in a cab from JFK ( yes, the last month snow storm passing through the city all of sudden that evening), we finally arrived at Park Terrace Hotel on Bryant Park. This was the first time staying at this hotel. We like a small boutique type of hotel. But it was a bit sad since there was no doorman or anyone welcoming us at a door. Well, it's a small hotel so we understand this short staff situation. We walked right in. We originally booked a premier high floor room and were told that our room was on the 7th floor. The 7th is a high floor, really??? (The highest floor is the 15th). When you try to book a room, either via the hotel's app. or write directly to them about your room preference way advance. They take those requests seriously. Since we did not write our room request in specific, we were assigned to the room on the 7th floor ( category of high floor starts from the 7th) facing to very REAR side of the hotel. When I walked in to the room, I almost cried. This room reminded me of my endless quest of a perfect apartment in the city when I was much younger! No view at all. Just a massive brick wall to stare at. As a someone with a New York's assertive attitude, we ran back to the front desk and asked for an another room. Miraculously, Rm1509 just became available. We paid the upgrade fee but it was worth the money! The room was studio with 2 big windows facing Bryant Park. The twinkle lights from the windows made us feel we were home.....! Breakfast was great. Elevators are slow. Free refillable water available at a closet in the hallway. Minimal yet sufficient service during our stay. Subway station is around the corner7 & BDFQM). Do we recommend this hotel to anyone? Maybe, not for anyone but someone who enjoys simplicity in life?

I loved Park Terrace’s proximity to Bryant Park and the subway. It made getting around the city super convenient. However, the hotel staff failed to place me in a hypoallergenic room despite my prior notification and their confirmation of my request. Because of this, I woke up each subsequent morning worse off than I was the night before. By my 2nd or 3rd morning, I awoke red faced and unable to breath. I had hives on my cheek and chin and red splotches covered by body. I knew exactly what was happening as I’ve known I had an allergy to down feathers since my diagnosis at age 3. Which is why I always request hypoallergenic bedding wherever I stay. A very common request too! After covering up my beet red face with makeup, I went down to the front desk only to be confronted with skepticism. I stood there about 5 minutes before the concierge confirmed that I did, in fact, give notice about my allergy. I was offered free drinks at the hotel bar for the inconvenience and told my room would be hypoallergenic upon my return at the end of the day. However, once I returned to my room later on, there were still down throw pillows in the room. Either the hotel staff is completely ignorant of a very common medical condition or they just do not care about their patrons well-being. I believe it is the latter, and for that reason I will never return. In addition to this issue, I was also dissatisfied with the room in general. During my booking, I paid for a “High Floor Deluxe Room w/ a View” but was given an 8th floor room with a view of absolutely nothing. The hotel’s top floor is 16, I believe. A better advertisement for my room would have been “Mid-Level Deluxe Room w/ a View of Our Neighbor’s and the Alley”. There are many options for hotel accommodations in NYC, so keep looking otherwise you might be dissatisfied with your stay like I was.

Plus sauna (ask for it to be turned on if you want to use it)Breakfast- great buffet breakfast- great selection of bagels, cold meats, cheese, donuts, fresh fruit, yogurt. The standard of food was amazing. I believe they get it in fresh from a bakery across from the hotel. You could also take breakfast away in handy take-away boxes. Great location! Metro or walking distance to all tourist attractions. Bad points:Breakfast seating- The only one, which was really quite annoying, was that it was hard to get a seat at breakfast without having to cram onto a table or wait after 0815. It meant we felt pressured to get to breakfast early enough to get a table I.e 0800 (maybe not always the case but could do with more seating/tables to enjoy the amazing buffet) Overall: Great hotel, thoroughly recommend and would stay again.

I am in NYC about once a month and I like trying different nice hotels and i've never had trouble sleeping like i did at this hotel. I tossed and turned all 3 nights, because the mattress had no support to it. Another HUGE problem I had, is that one night the hotel was throwing it's annual employee Christmas party in their 6th floor bar (i was on the 5th floor) and it was so loud that my room was shaking. I was up taking meetings at 5am and had to be up again at 5am, so this is an unacceptable negative for me, especially when the location of the party is in the middle of a bunch of guest rooms.

We stayed in a corner studio room (2nd floor from top) which had the most magnificent view over Bryant Park. The layout of the room was brilliant – feels very large and light. It had all the bells and whistles, was meticulously clean, and the bathroom was beautiful – a practical shower and benchspace and the glass sliding door was very good for privacy (even though you’d initially think not). Beds were comfortable and well positioned and we also had the sofabed rolled out and that was a double bed and very comfortable too. The bathroom products on offer were lovely (and it is good to see they clearly point out that they are saving money by not providing little travel sizes but if you take the residential size of there products you pay – so it is nice and clear). The wardrobe is very small – takes only a couple of shirts and coats but there are enough spots to place your bag in the room. The front desk staff could not be more helpful and they delivered on every request required. They were also very quick. The breakfast room was good but very busy and you’ll need to watch your table as we got up to get another bagel but lost the table as the dirty plate was removed and someone else swooped. Somehow that needs to be sorted out. The only thing I would suggest for improvements is for some cutlery in the room – there is a wonderful pastry shop next door but if you forget a plastic knife or fork then you get to your room and you have no plate or cutlery, just the coffee cup saucer, which involves co-ordination skills. There is a bar fridge but no mini-bar.Location was ideal – Bryant park is centrally located.5 star rating and like others, this would be my ‘go to’ in NYC (and didn’t get any special prices or deals so can justify the standard price for the room).","Sydney, Australia","xmas201983</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",3,5.0

Before coming I did extensive research to find the perfect hotel. Upon arrival on a busy Thursday afternoon there was one person working at the desk, and one elevator in service. The check in process was expedited due to the fact that I’d already checked in online, but waiting 15-20 for an elevator to get to my room was painful. There was no bell man to help with my bags or even open the front door when I arrived. Once I FINALLY made it to my room, I was disappointed with the layout and the view. The tv stand was in the middle of the room, which made the room seem much smaller, and the view was of the office building across the street not of Bryant Park as the website had said. The bed was not very comfortable either. Thankfully we didn’t spend much time in the room. I was also disappointed in the fact there was no room service. There is a restaurant on site, but no way to order food or drinks to the room. I even used Uber to order food one morning. The food was delivered to the front desk, but the front desk never brought it to my room or called to let me know it was available. Also, the rooftop bar is small with only 2 igloos available. Overall my experience at this hotel was awful, and I would not recommend anyone booking their stay here.

We actually cancelled another reservation to book here. Upon arrival, we checked in to our deluxe room and it was ready early- that was a huge plus. However, we then waited over 10 minutes (no exaggeration) for the elevator. There are 2 elevators servicing the entire hotel and we weren't sure if 1 was out of order. We had somewhere to be and simply needed to change our shoes in the room and drop our luggage and we were almost late in getting out because of the elevators. Needless to say the rest of the weekend we took the stairs only. Luckily we were on the 3rd floor so it was easy to just go up and down via the stairs. The room was fairly small and the mattress was horrible. We barely slept the entire night because of how uncomfortable we were. Also, queen size mattresses, really? I think for over $600/night there should be a king mattress. The bathroom was well appointed, and I liked the lay out. Great lighting on the mirrors and the toiletries were very nice. The in room Nespresso machine was also a nice touch. Sunday morning we walked up to the 6th floor to check out the breakfast. The breakfast is a good option if you want to eat 2,000 calories and feel sick after. Hardly any choices for someone eating healthy. Croissants, bagels, donuts, babka, cookies and the list goes on. There were hard boiled eggs, out of season fruit and some yogurt at the end. I can't eat dairy so really I was left with a hard boiled egg. Also, the line was insane (at around 815am) and there were no tables whatsoever. We grabbed a coffee and went back to the room. I am glad it was free and we did not pay extra for it. Take a walk outside and you'll find tons of amazing healthy breakfast/brunch options. We went to check out at the normal time (12pm) and had to wait for the elevators because of our luggage. Again, a 10 minute wait time and then when it got to the 3rd floor, it was 100% completely packed in like sardines. I literally squeezed in our luggage to the brim of the elevator and then my partner & I took the stairs and met the elevator down in the lobby to get our luggage out of it. Really strange elevator situation for such a large hotel going with 16 floors. I don't mind waiting a few minutes, but over 10 minutes is unacceptable. The real problem here though was that they charged me twice and still have yet to rectify the situation. When I checked out, I told them that I was already charged on my credit card. It was not a hold- it was an actual charge which I showed them on my Chase credit card statement. She said that I would be charged again for a different amount (slightly lower) and that the other charge never went through. Obviously that was not the case. We already had a pending $650 ""hold"" plus a charge for our room stay. Then she was trying to charge me again. Of course, she was incorrect and I was charged twice for the same room. So essentially the hotel charged me over $1,500 between duplicating the room charge plus the hold. I am still waiting on my refund. I called 4 days after and the woman told me the manager will ""hopefully"" get to it that day. I demanded he take care of it immediately as this was unacceptable to be charged $1,500 for a 1 night stay that should have been under $600. If my refund isn't processed by tomorrow, I will be calling Chase and reporting them as fraudulent. A real headache of a situation that could have been completely avoided had the front desk staff been competent. Needless to say, we will not be back. We'll stick with the Loews Regency near Central Park which is always our go to and we never have any issues with.","Williston Park, New York","jventurini13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Williston Park, New York</strong>",9,2.0

With soothing colors and a modern decor, as well as floor-to-ceiling windows and a higher ceiling, the room felt light and airy as well as comforting and cozy... a private nest in the middle of the metropolis. We didn't get a chance to use the in-room Keurig, but I loved the ""hydration station"" by the elevator, offering refillable plastic bottles and a water dispenser. I filled one bottle four times. Free and smart amenity. And in the room we enjoyed a complimentary bottle of orange soda and a bag of slightly sweet and cripsy kettle corn. The bed was comfortable and the bedding was higher end. We slept soundly and the room was quiet. The next morning we enjoyed the breakfast buffet that's included with the room. We noshed on high-quality continental breakfast foods.

I use a wheelchair, which meant waiting times of 15 minutes or longer, or having to catch the lift on its way up before it filled up going down...and then being stuck in a crowded elevator that stops on every floor. It was not a good experience, and with multiple other hotel options at the same price point around the area, I am not sure we would consider this hotel again.

Noise in the hallways does however easily enter, but there is little traffic so it’s not a nuisance. A word of caution though, Our room was facing onto Bryant Park, the Bryant Park Restaurant had a band playing on our final night... very noisy, but they stopped playing at 9pm.... very little if any street noise entered the room.What we liked about the staff was that they we’re unfailingly polite and nothing was too much of a problem. Their professionalism was on par with the Four Seasons in Hong Kong which we visited a few months ago.The hotel is expensive, but most N.Y. hotels are, and not having been in NY for a very long time its difficult to compare apples with apples, however we did stay at the Nadler , Covent Garden the week before. Both hotels are very similar, with the Nadler having slightly larger rooms. My conclusion is that the Park Terrace is good value for New York. It is in a very good location if your a tourist.

Location: Good access to most touristy spots. Right across Bryant Park & NY library, close to Times Square, Empire State Bldg. A convenient hotel at midtown. There is a Newark Express Shuttle across the other side of Byrant Park so easy to get to the hotel for guests taking public shuttle. (See my other review on the shuttle service)Room&Bathroom: Stayed at Premier Room but still kinda small. The premier room has a long walkaway so you can leave your shoes and bags there. Very clean. My room was on 3/F, looking at the sideway of NY library. Little view and some noises in the morning in which I found it acceptable. No bathtub, just a shower area with curtain and sometimes water might overflow. Shower water is strong and hot. There is a foldable wooden bench inside shower in case for people who need to sit down or elderly worrying the floor being slippery. Toilette belongs to Italian brand Malin+Goetz. Didnt know this brand before. I looked at the ingredients and they are of good qualities without those harsh chemicals. No razor or toothbrush. There is a filtered machine at elevator lobby on every floor and empty plastic bottles are provided for guests to refill water. Breakfast: Its on 6/F every morning. Has freshly squeezed carrot juice, supermarket quality OJ, standard coffee and some tea bags. Bagels and cream cheese come from Zucker’s. Has some cold cut, parma ham, cold hard boiled eggs, and a few types of salad veggies. Fruits include blueberries, mango, orange slices. No hot dishes. They all taste good. Has paper boxes and cups to take away if you’re in a hurry. The drawback is that there are always too many people and hard to find seats. Need to share table for most days.Front desk: Friendly, always greet guests coming back. Reliable service. I expected an important mail coming in and the front desk delievered it to my room once it arrived. The only thing I found a bit confusing was the final bill. They gave me a bill listing the breakdown of all the fees. At first I thought I got overcharged but once I calculated the total, it was the same price as listed at Agoda where I booked my room.

It's in a great location and has a good breakfast included so there is hope, but there were lots of little things that would make me stay elsewhere next time: -only one of the two elevators appeared to be working this past weekend which meant very long wait times. -Duvet on the bed is very thick so I asked for a regular blanket around 10:45pm - it arrived about 30 minutes later and only after a second phone call to reception. -All 4 pillows in my room were very soft and thin and became the width of the sheet when laying on them. They delivered what I'd consider a real pillow (just one) after my call for this. -They say the bathrooms are marble but my shower appeared to be more of a plastic insert. There was already a crack at the bottom and the door did not seal well so the floor was flooded after each shower. -Housekeeping knocked on my door in the morning and woke me up despite my having the do not disturb sign up. I saw her in the hall later and she apologized but...? -I was on the 11th floor and did not hear street noise. I had inconsiderate guests on my floor that allowed the doors to slam, but that can be anywhere. -Hair dryer had only one setting - low - and would have taken hours to dry my hair. I went outside each morning with wet hair. Also, the way the plug is configured in the bathroom meant it would not fit and you have to blowdry in the bedroom area.-many TV channels showed static and would freeze-Wifi in my room was poor-I had a refrigerator in my room but I found out after leaving a sandwich in it that it wasn't actually working.-Nothing about the hotel was explained to me upon check in and i found out details only on check out when airing my complaints (which the staff was completely indifferent to)- apparently there is a ""guest closet' that has extra blankets, etc that you can help yourself to and the popcorn and soda that was sitting on the desk was complimentary. I'm not sure how I was supposed to know any of this. Absolutely nothing was told to me on check in.My stay was frustrating enough to go elsewhere next time - too many good hotels in NY.","Dallas, Texas","Casinoroyale72</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",17,3.0

Back then the website had different names for room categories. We booked a deluxe Park View room for 7 nights at A$800 per night which is a very expensive hotel room even for NYC.So we kept an eye for a cheaper option and 2-3 weeks before travel we checked Park Terrace again and the room options had changed and now this new term Studio View room was introduced and the previous Deluxe with a View was removed. But now the deluxe Rooms were the smallest room option and then there was Premiere Room and Premier High Floor option at $200 less per night from what we had booked for Deluxe View. So we decided to book our trip again and booked the Premiere High Floor expecting that they would still have a few Park facing rooms in that category. We messaged the hotel requesting “it would be great if they could give us a park facing room on a higher floor”. To which they replied they’ll try but can’t promise. At the time of check-in they said they had given us a room on level 9 and doesn’t have any view. Which was disappointing. Our room had a lot of large windows but they were pointless as they all faced other office buildings with direct view at peoples desks and their office lights on all night. The space between our windows and their desks was about 15 feet :(The hotel was kind enough to move us to a room with a partial Park view on day 2 but again it fully faced a brick wall with just a hint of a view if you go to the windows and look to your side. Well I guess something better than nothing. Other disappointing factors were that the 40th Street which the hotel is on was always fully blocked with traffic because one lane was completely occupied with construction material for the Bryant Park Christmas Market Installation. The whole park was jam packed with shops and an ice rink coming up soon. Good part: The Hotel is new and is well designed. They offer a good buffet breakfast with some great donuts. The only thing missing in that breakfast is hot egg options like scrambled eggs. Made to order eggs would be ever better but not offered at the moment. Best part. They have water filling stations on all levels and we can just grab an empty bottle and fill it up. This helped us save on buying water. All the staff is great. They are welcoming and friendly. Conclusion: If you want to have the Park View you have to shell out the big bucks and grab the Studio View rooms. Any other rooms and you will be facing the wall of another building/Zero view. P.S: The Hotel is only 15 floors which is very short for NYC midtown. Anything above level 7 is considered high floor as per the hotel.,"Sydney, Australia","parag_331</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",12,3.0

I liked the hotel so much that we decided to cancel our existing reservation at a nearby hotel for Nov. 2019 for the NYC Marathon and book at the Park Terrace Hotel. The reason? Customer service. How often do you show up to a hotel and the room is not ready an hour or more after check in? Or you make a very specific reservation for a specific type of room and upon arrival, that room is not available? Factor in the stress, excitement, and quirks of marathon traveling and those little mishaps can seem amplified. Working with Mark B. and Charlie has been painless and stress free. They have gone out of their way to block a specific room and to be understanding of all of our requests. I have no doubt that marathon weekend will be much less stressful than it has been in the past because our accommodations are locked in with no surprises.

The woman checking me in was personal and incredibly hospitable. That was the best part of my stay.I was brought a couple of cupcakes to celebrate my anniversary~ more on that later...During breakfast on the patio I was sprayed with windex from the window cleaning company. Enough so that my food and myself smelled like windex...the only answer I received was to throw my food away, get back in a now existing line of about 20 people, and wait to get another breakfast. The food itself was great: just being seemingly not cared about during this process was ridiculous. They really couldn't plan the window cleaning for a different time frame than when they know people are on the terrace eating? I also would have been much happier had I not had to now use either a plastic or hot glass for my juice...or pull a heavy door with a drunk and plate of food in my hands...waiting to ask where I should throw it away...I love wasting my time standing around repeating myself to multiple people about simple issues...Check out was very impersonal. The main issue I had with it was that I'd specifically asked a tall man for a bag containing leftovers from an amazing steak house be put in a fridge while my luggage was held for a few hours. I was assured it would be taken care of...I returned 45 minutes later because I'd realized I had forgotten my cash in my suitcase and wanted to buy some small things in cash. When I for my luggage for a minute, they brought it out of the luggage room and my food was tied around the top of the luggage...what a waste of $200 worth of steaks if I hadn't come back and asked another person to make sure to put it in a fridge. I then overheard the concierge, I remember exactly which ones, discussing signing cards and banging out the magnolia cupcake order: as though it were a factory process. Pretty much ruined my experience knowing that they feel the cards and cupcakes are a nuisance.I'd originally been absolutely planning to go back, but after the breakfast fiasco where no one cared about my time or food safety, and especially after the checkout process: I'll most likely be looking around for another hotel in the area to spend my money on every couple of months.*photos of breakfast terrace, self service breakfast line ( food was sourced from great local places, but 0 line when I arrived and 20 people wait when I had to get my food myself again), and the steaks I didn't finish that would have been unsafe to eat had I not triple checked they were refrigerated.",,Sajatheprince,1,3.0

The room was clean and modern, with helpful technology like light controls next to the bed and phone-casting available on the TVs. Likewise, the view was great and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The Terrazzo outdoor lounge is a really great space and perfect at this time of year, with views of Bryant Park and the Empire State Building. A few issues with our stay that are under varying levels of control by the hotel: 1. The service elevator was not working, which meant staff needed to use the two main elevators, which added to the delays with what seemed like generally slow elevators. 2. Breakfast was really poorly managed from a logistical standpoint. (Get ready for first-world problems) While the quality of the food was great - local bagels and pastries, fresh fruit and coffee - there is/are: a. no clear start or end to the breakfast line  b. too few toasters for what was (as expected at 10am on a Saturday morning) 20ish  people in line c. cream cheese and butter setup in the middle of the buffet line, rather than near  the toasters, such that people would get a bagel, then get out of line to toast them,  then wait in line again to get the topping. Yes, this is because people are stupid, but  that's something a business needs to consider.  d. far too little coffee made available - people standing in line for coffee alone would  have to wait several ""rotations"" of new coffee before getting a cup - just get a bigger  machine that makes more and get a larger dispenser. While expensive, I think there's a lot of value in this hotel, from the service to the quality to the amenities and location.

I understand they want to be eco conscious, but imagining what the guests before might have done with the toiletries or that the naked guests before you have used it is not super appealing. Their eco argument is also somewhat offset by the disposable cups they use for breakfast for both (!) coffee and juice. 2) although breakfast was very good, there was not enough space to accommodate all guests. We stayed there for 6 days and were not once able to get a table without waiting in line / having to share our table with other guests. I assume it’s less critical when the weather is good because then people can take advantage of the terrace. Considering the price category, I would have expected more. Also, I found the coffee extremely bad (I understand it is supposed to be some hip NY brand but it was really awful for European taste buds). 3) it takes ages for the elevators to arrive, but I think this cannot be changed due to the hotel’s architecture.All in all, I think I would book again despite small downsides due to the great location and friendly staff.",,TravellingJaneDoe,1,4.0

Bagels, cheese, donuts, salami, toast, spreads, muesli, fruit, juices, tea and coffee. The hotel does seem to be marketed towards business travellers. Compact, convenient and close to everything with spaces provided for meetings. We stayed during the UN General Assembly meetings and this meant the prices increased substantially. Booked on the day!

What a fantastic experience. We needed to wait a minute because we booked the room 15 minutes prior arrival at booking.com. Upon waiting to get our data in place, two bottles of water were brought to get us relaxed after a long flight.We were upgraded to a slightly bigger room and because of the birthday of my wife we were treated with a fantastic piece of cheese cake of a local bakery. The room and hotel itself are just like the pictures you see on the website. Absolute stunning quality, I made a Nespresso on my in room machine to combine with the delicious cheesecake and came to rest right from the start. We stayed for three nights and had the best time of our lived first time ever in NYC.Tranquility, elegance and quality are three words to describe the hotel.After breakfast the restaurant is transformed into a bar where you can enjoy a drink and small bite.Tip #1: ask for Larissa Santiago at the reception she helped us getting into the right mood from the start and guided us to some nice spots in the neighborhood. Each night while entering the building she gently checked if everything was still allright and if other help was needed.

Malin @ Goetz toiletries, complimentary artisanal snacks, continental breakfast uses foods from premium NY vendors. The hotel is also fairly eco conscious so rooms are not stocked with bottled water (you get water from a central refilling station), and avoids single use toiletries. The lighting scheme in the room is well designed and is adjustable on a continuous dimmer. In short, what they give you is on need and on point.

The New York Public Library is opposite and Fifth Avenue is right round the corner. The staff at the Park Terrace were friendly and welcoming and always had a smile for us when we were coming and going.

Perfect layouts, floor to ceiling windows with great views of Bryant park and the NYC Public Library. New modern finishes. The TV wall with the art has a classy pannilng so you don't see ANY wires (which I'm a stickler about...note: I'm A stickler about pretty much everything :) You can certainly get bigger, but I don't think finishes get any nicer than this. Again, mostly due to the newness of the hotel. (Tiny note to the management, please go in and change ALL the hinges on your shower stalls to open IN and not OUT...or at least to swing in both directions)LOCATIONHeart of NYC. We had a baby with us in a stroller, so subway or any taxi/share riding was out of the question. We walked EVERYWHERE. So being this central was key. TERRACETheir 6th-floor terrace AND common area is just criminally underutilized. Which worked out great for us, because most of the day (we were there during weekdays) we had the place all to ourselves :) I'd post pictures, but I'm a stickler about privacy too, so I won't. But their website pictures of the terrace are spot on. And something you can't see, that I definitely want to give a shout out to the management for: GREAT LOUNGE MUSIC playing all the time in the lounge/terrace areas! Really set the mood. Just lovely! (oh on that note, we also noticed the beautiful smell in the lobby, keep up the good work with the scent machine too! I used to live in NYC and the streets sure don't smell any BETTER these days :) So the lobby smell is so refreshing! again these are inexpensive but important touches that make a world of difference for the customer experience)BREAKFASTI have to say I'm torn about the breakfast here because it's DELICIOUS, the croissants and pastries are irresistible. The bagels and flavored cream cheeses are perfect. And they have GREAT PROSCIUTTO (which I'm very picky about!)...that said, after 3 days, you have gained 3 lbs and you just can't eat this for breakfast every day..They DO have a lovely greek yogurt spread with toppings, but who's going to eat that next to the die-for-pastries? :)GYMModern and kept clean. All you need from a gym. And you'll need it after the breakfast pastries! my god, I ate too much :)LAUNDRYNo one mentions this, but again we were traveling with a baby, so I did a load of laundry EVERY NIGHT. They provide a FREE LAUNDRY ROOM! Their machines are clean, short efficient cycles, and they'll give you their commercial-grade laundry detergent which worked wonders on baby throw up and food stains. SERVICEEveryone we interacted with was just SUPER nice to us and our baby (who, you know, acts like a baby and makes a mess and wants to touch things he shouldn't touch, and throws cheerios on the floor, and spill mom's coffee...). I'm blanking on the names of the two ladies at the front desk (i'm SO sorry! One was Gabriella, I'm 70% sure, and the other...shoot...I should have written it down!) but they were BOTH lovely and patient and helpful, especially on our last day when our flight was delayed and we needed some extra time in the room for the baby to nap...RIDE TO AIRPORTOh yeah, that reminds me, definitely take them up on their ""flat rate"" taxi ride to JFK. The driver arrived early and waited for us, and was really patient with us when the baby had a meltdown on the way (to be fair, it was raining and the 45 min ride turned into a 90 minute ride in horrible stop and go traffic, so I was getting a bit sick too...what I'm saying is, don't blame my angel baby :) Back to the point, really good transportation option, good price and we had a nice driver. I would definitely stay there again...but I don't see when, because, as you might be able to tell from my review, we're NEVER traveling with a baby AGAIN :) lol",,GoPlaces8125,1,5.0

Beautiful bathroom and love the premium shampoos and body products.Great location in front of the Bryant Park. Watch out when booking rooms with park views - these are not directly facing the park views. The hotel is rather facing the side of the library. So not sure if worth the up charge for park views.Awesome terrace to relax at. Friendly & helpful front desk staff! One minor negative: The walls are thick, but it gets noisy in the morning in the hallways. The neighboring doors are extremely loud when they’re being closed. The housekeeping staff knocks repeatedly on every room, yells out ‘housekeeping’ loudly before opening the room and then hearing the door slam.. over and over again. Seems like they take a count of every empty room in the morning around 8ish.. so for quite some time all you hear is knocking, then “housekeeeeeping” (x2 on each room) and doors being opened and closed.

The woman who checked us in said that they would call or text when our room was ready, and that it should be ready before the normal check in time of 3pm. We didn’t receive a call or text, and only found out our room was ready when we called at 3pm. Our family of three stayed in a studio suite, it has a king bed and sofa sleeper. Their website advertises that it sleeps up to three people, so I was very surprised to see an “extra person” charge for each day of our stay when we checked out.

The hotel was quite busy when we tried to check in at 1pm, so no rooms were available, but by 330pm we were given a deluxe room on the 3rd floor with a view of Bryant Park. Be aware that it is more of a library view with an angled view of the park if you look up the street, but still it was nice not to have to look out at another tall building. The staff left a little treat and note in our room for our anniversary which was a nice touch. We found all the staff here to be very friendly. The soundproofing in the rooms is great, we couldn't hear anything in the hotel, or from the street below even though we were on the 3rd floor. The free breakfast is very busy and chaotic in the morning and it is usually hard to find somewhere to sit, however the food is delicious and well worth the wait. The rooms are not large, but you are in Manhattan. We didn't have any issues navigating 2 people with 2 large suitcases. The rooms were modern, clean and bright. However, I'm not a big fan of residential sized bathroom amenities that are shared amongst guests, so we did end up purchasing our own amenities at the local CVS. I would have much preferred individual sized shampoo, conditioner, etc. The hotel is in the perfect location to explore midtown manhattan, we were able to easily walk to Times Square, The Broadway Show ""Come From Away: - which you have to see!, Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, shopping on 5th Ave and Madison Ave. For everything else the subway is 2 min up the street. Blue Bottle coffee is a few doors down and it is hands down one of the best coffees I have ever had.

I was offered a room in the 2nd floor and 6th floor where the breakfast is served and yes it’s very noisy on this floor. I have a 2 year old. I chose the 6th floor thinking higher floor would be better. This room (611) is in such a corner and I don’t think anyone would like it. I asked them to put me to a room where there is a better view on a higher floor. They kept showing me the upgrade rates. I am like why do you want me to upgrade when I already have paid. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone and definitely wouldn’t come back. They have a lot of categories, all so confusing and they don’t have any king beds available in the first 4/5 categories. Please in case you are booking, call them and confirm what category you are booking and don’t be fooled by reviews just like me. All they talk about is money and very professional but u helpful customer service. I have travelled all around the world and never felt so bad about the service. ",,sirisukumar,22,1.0

As Mrs. Santiago helped me check into my suite, she made a lot of great suggestions for places to visit in the city, and helped me book a trip on the sailing vessel, The Shearwater, an 81 foot wooden schooner built in 1929. As I spent the afternoon sailing throughout the Hudson, I couldn’t help from thinking that the one thing I was missing was that Puerto Rican beauty waiting back for me at the hotel. I spent the rest of the hot afternoon bicycling throughout the city to some of the other great places she suggested I visit during my stay, I.e Hudson Yards, The Highline, and down to Bleecker Street in the West Village. As I licked my ice cream in the hot summer sun, and reflected back on the great day, the highlight of it all was meeting Larissa, and the rest of the friendly Concierge at the Park Terrace Hotel.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","RogerThat007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",1,5.0

Loved the bathroom amenities that was provided - you didn't have to worry about shampoo/conditioner/soap/body lotion. Product was top of the line. And as a woman, I truly appreciate. They had a nepresso machine which I loved because I'm one of those people who just can't function without a sip of caffeine. You're also provided with an iron and ironing board( a lot of hotels don't have them inside the rooms anymore). Housekeeping was wonderful. I always came back to a pristine room. Oh and the almost forgot about the drinking water station! Wonderful! Breakfast was free with the accommodation. No complaints here. Enjoyed it each morning. The terrace was a bonus. Outdoor space in a big city is always welcome.Location was great if you're visiting and doing a lot of sightseeing. Metro stations near by. Lots of places to get a grab to eat. and of course Bryant Park to just people watch and chill.

There are similar priced hotels in the area, and they will give you more space but the rooms will be older and the breakfasts will be mediocre. If you are ok with a little less space, you'll be happier here. We had a premier queen that had a separate seating area, though the room was still tight. Our room faced the back of another building with an alley in between. Though it wasn't much of a view, it was very quiet and we didn't hear any street noise. The room itself was comfortable with a great bed and bedding. There were USB charging ports on both sides of the bed. One nit is there should be more hooks in the bathroom – there is only one allowing only one towel to be hung. There are coat hooks on the wall near the thermostat, but having more in the bathroom would be better. The breakfast was continental and high quality, including a rotating selection of fruit. And they provide takeaway boxes in case you can't have a proper sit down meal. Espresso drinks are available from a barista at an extra cost. Lastly, like all hotels in NYC, the price of the rooms vary greatly with demand. In our research, when prices were high at Park Terrace, they were high at other nearby hotels as well. So don't think of what you’re getting for, say, $400 or $700 night, if that's the rate for your stay, because you'll be paying that for similar class hotels in the area. If that's not in your budget, then you'll need to find a lower class hotel, motel, hostel, etc.., or stay on a different date or at a different location. We found Sunday nights generally had the lowest rate. ","San Francisco, California","timezoner</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",36,5.0

Upon check in, I was upgraded to a premium room but no one told me. Yes, you'd think this would be a good thing, but when I've paid for a room with a view, I don't want a marginally larger room instead (with a view of an air conditioner) with no explanation. The desk staff acted like they had done me some grand favor and then went into the back room to talk about me privately before finding me the room I had booked. My booking had also said that my room would have a refrigerator - which it did not, and they wouldn't give me one. The cleaning staff seemed uninterested, sometimes leaving me new towels and toilet paper, other times not. The tv/iphone pairing did not work and the air conditioning barely cooled the rooms at all. The breakfast spread was the best part of the stay -- if only the counters and tables had been kept clean of old food and dishes. A disappointing stay to say the least. I'd think it was just my experience but others I talked to in the hotel as well as a good friend also staying in another room had the same experience. Finally, after posting my review on Expedia, I got a non-descriptive and unspecific response about how really they couldn't have done much to help me, or what could be done to apologize for my disappointing experience. In customer service, it isn't so much about the mistakes made as it is what the company does to respond - and this hotel really seems to not care at all about their guests. Too bad.

It was the perfection location. Just a quick walk to dinner and the show, a nice walk through Times Square on the way home, and close to several subway stops and lots of shopping. Of course, being across from Bryant Park was nice, too! We stayed in a Deluxe View room on the seventh floor, and our room looked just like the picture on the website with the couch and table. We had a nice side view of the park and I loved that our window opened. There was enough room for our carry-on suitcases and bags without making us feel crowded. The room felt light and fresh. There was a coffee maker with tiny mugs, and a really nice, small snack bar station with delicious looking treats that we didn’t eat. They also had a little box of essentials - Tylenol, bandaids - which we did use, so I was thankful for that! There was a nice welcome treat, and they also left us cupcakes from a local bakery for our anniversary! Five stars for that! The bathroom was a decent size for NYC, and the counter wasn’t huge but provided enough space for all of my things. The shower was good for one person and the shampoo and conditioner smelled amazing. The breakfast spread was really nice - although there is no hot food and it’s mostly pastries (good ones!!), the yogurt and granola was good. Overall, it was a really great benefit! The outside terrace space was really pretty. My husband had good service when he grabbed a drink at the bar. Also, the water bottles and filling station were perfect for the hot weekend.I tried out the Peleton in the gym, which was clean, well stocked with towels and water, and quiet. There was a wide range of other equipment. The front desk staff was friendly and helpful with any questions we had, including drink recommendations. In addition, all the staff I met in the halls or elevator were very friendly!There were just a few small things that made me take off one star. The bathroom door slides but does not shut and leaves a large gap into the room - so there’s is very little privacy. The conditioner had some black buildup/mildew where the screw-top meets the container. I also wish they had body wash instead of or in addition to a soap bar. A hook or bar to hang washcloths inside the shower would be nice. I wish the bar opened before 5 so we could enjoy an afternoon drink on the terrace, but it looks like they are working on that. Overall, we would definitely stay here again! Loved the location, the room was a nice size, the staff and service were friendly, the gym was clean and useful, the breakfast is delicious and free, and the water stations were extremely useful!

I am so glad we found this hotel because it was a fabulous experience! And we will stay here again!First, the staff are amazing. Very friendly and always helpful. We arrived well before check-in, but they invited us to enjoy coffee in the lounge before we headed out for some activities, stored our luggage and had it ready in our room when we checked in that afternoon. When we walked in, I had a beautiful handwritten card from the hotel staff and cupcakes from a local bakery! Incredible! My friend had arranged to have a bottle of champagne in our room for check in, and the hotel staff used this tip to order the cupcakes, even getting cake flavor recommendations from my friend. The room was space-planned well, very clean and featured nice amenities like a Nespresso machine, fridge, Bose Bluetooth speaker, large-sized toiletries, bathrobes, safe, lounger chair (that I believe folds out to a small bed), and small table with chairs. Each floor had a water bottle refilling station which is fantastic! Plus, there was a supply closet on each floor for guests to get items they may have forgotten: toothbrush, razor, contact lens case, comb, etc. Such a great idea and saves hassle of having to go to front desk. Breakfast is included and was a nice continental spread of pastries, yogurt, fruit, juices and coffee. In the afternoon and evening it’s a lounge for cocktails. The rooftop outdoor space has tables and couches, so at either time of day you can enjoy being outside. Loved the midtown location and Bryant Park is steps away. Thanks to everyone at Park Terrace!

Choice of hotels was very limited, it was late and the weather was awful, so we were probably lucky to find a room here. Thankfully it proved to be a good choice. Check-in was smooth and quick, the room was clean and modern, but on the small side, even by NY standards... I initially thought the bathroom was a cupboard! That said, I was mainly there to rest and the bed was comfy and the room quiet, so I can’t complain. There is a breakfast buffet included with a good choice of breads, pastries and fruit, more than enough if you want a quick bite to eat before heading out for the day. Check out was as smooth as check in. Would I stay here again? Probably yes, although I would consider paying a little more for a slightly bigger room if I was staying more than a night, or travelling with someone.","Crouch End, United Kingdom","L4991VZjoels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Crouch End, United Kingdom</strong>",0,4.0

Their king suite overlooking the library and park was amazing, sliding glass doors open for fresh air. Somehow it was also super quiet (again rare in NYC). The breakfast is really spectacular. One of the best bagels I've had in NYC (and I lived there for several years). This is rarely included in a hotel rate in NYC, so to get something of high quality is exceptional. Also, no one mentioned this in other reviews, but hotel actually has FREE laundry machines in the basement. Amazing if you are on a long trip like I was. Staff at NYC hotels are notoriously rude.

The hotel has a nice bar on the 6th floor with a terrace and the bartenders were also friendly and helpful. Bryan Park is great for sitting and people watching and 5th Ave shopping is nearby. There's also a Whole Foods nearby and a great sushi place that's close. I have nothing but rave reviews for this place and I would recommend to anyone and go back in a heartbeat.","San Antonio, Texas","musicdreams01</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",0,5.0

Price point is similar/slightly less than other luxury hotels we have stayed at in NYC. It is absolutely fine. Nothing was wrong per se. They lost my suitcase, but found it relatively quickly. Check in was easy and friendly. Room was...just fine. It had large windows overlooking Bryant Park, but still felt VERY small for the price. I understand NYC hotel rooms are small, but it just felt OK. Bed was comfortable enough. Small refrigerator and espresso machine are nice touches. Bathroom was small and oddly shaped; the large sliding door was not built for privacy. Breakfast was a nice twist on the usual breakfast foods. I wish they had a restaurant on site and with the bar stayed open later than 11. Good food nearby, easy subway access and walkable to the usual midtown Manhattan tourist locales. Overall liked it fine, but felt they are trying to be a luxury hotel but not quite there yet.","Canfield, Ohio","thomerun</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canfield, Ohio</strong>",29,3.0

The rooms are beautiful with nice amenities and most importantly, location is the best in all Manhattan. Situated on 40th St. across from Bryant Park and the central library you have easy access to multiple subway lines and can walk almost anywhere in the city quite easily. Included breakfast was phenomenal and plentiful and Jenna sure knows how to make a great latte (super extra strong as requested). Gabriela at the front desk has to be singled out for her friendly and helpful attitude. It always felt like we were at home when we saw her.

Loved the terrace although some rainy days stopped us using it. Nice to drink at the bar in the evenings.

We loved everything about it--perfection! When we first arrived around 9:30am from our train ride, the front desk welcomed us and took my cell phone so that when a room was available (the usual check in is 3:00pm) he could call us. We were told we could go upstairs to the 6th floor terrace and take advantage of the complimentary breakfast bar which is offered. The 6th floor area is beautiful and shortly after eating a delicious breakfast, a room was ready for us. We found out when we went back down to the front desk that they had upgraded us to a wonderful room with a view of the library and Bryant Park. We were so delighted. Upon arriving in our room we found everything to be just perfect. A nice and airy room, spotlessly clean, and a modern roomy bathroom, including wonderful upscale bath products. The kettle corn and orange pop were a terrific welcome treat also! Each morning we had the most amazing breakfast and were able to bring it out on the terrace. The terrace is really beautiful, very lush with green plants and wonderful seating areas to relax. It is truly what sets this property apart. If you look to one side, you can see a perfect view of the Empire State Building and if you look over the other side, you can see the lovely, bustling Bryant Park and the NY Public Library. It is truly an oasis.The amazing breakfast included fresh juices (carrot/ginger was my favorite), lattes/cappuccinos, all sorts of breads and treats from local purveyors such as bagels, breads, jams, cheeses/meats, the most delicious chocolate babka, hard boiled eggs, and a yummy curated yogurt station with all sorts of fresh fruits, including blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, melons, etc. Really delicious and totally filled us up for the morning. They even had take away boxes you could fill to take breakfast with you (or an additional treat to go). The staff is all young, energetic, enthusiastic, and adorable, and they could not do enough for us. They took such good care of us at breakfast, bringing us our special coffee drinks in the morning, and tending to us in the afternoon/evening, where they had other treats like cupcakes and breadsticks, etc. in the afternoon, again, from local establishments such as the popular Magnolia Bakery.

The rooms are smallish but extremely modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable and the noon check out was welcoming. The terrace on the 6th floor was perfect. We wished we weren't so booked up for the weekend and could have enjoyed more time on there. Everything about this hotel is great. It's a boutique hotel that is not a chain and there are no other hotels in their portfolio. I wonder if that is why it's attention to detail is so perfect. None of the staff members were lax, everyone catered to us and was super attentive and friendly. We found the Park Terrace on a discount site but ended up booking direct for the same price. Lately we've had very poor service when booking through third party sites so we browse on there and always book direct.I would highly recommend this for special occasions in NYC. Well worth the money. And the location being steps away from Bryant Park was just perfect.

The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was modern and shower pressure was very good. There are water stations near the elevator to fill up water bottles provided, which is a great idea. Breakfast is included in the price, however during our stay, there was no toaster available as it had 'broken'. I did hear many guests asking about a toaster. The breakfast was simple but nice, croissants, bagels, bread, fruit, donuts, tea, coffee and juice. Would be great if they had cereal available or even a toaster. Breakfast was not often replenished, and you had to constantly ask staff to fill up the food and juice. Also very hard to get a table at breakfast, and some breakfast staff were unfriendly.One morning the fire alarm went off, we left the room quickly, no mention of a practice drill, until we asked staff in the lobby. As a 4 star hotel, hotel guests should be provided with information about these fire drills.Lovely hotel, however for the price we paid per night, I expected a little more organisation and information for guests.

The air conditioning was good and the staff were so lovely, Noah and Leoan, and one other member of staff at reception (im so sorry i can't remember his name) were so helpful. Everyone was. Breakfast was simple but lovely, a buffet complimentary for every guest. the gym had good facilities. Only fault would be that there is no room service, or fridge in the room if you want to bring food back, and if you sleep during the day like i did (jet lag) then you can hear loud drills and noises as they are doing up the hotel still.Recyceable water bottles and water machines around the hotel are a nice touch too.Thanks team Bryant Park!",,mistypenning,4,4.0

Note on website, it states a king bed with kitchenette. When we checked in our room, it was super small under 400 sq ft, with a queen bed and no kitchenette in sight and had no park view. When I called the front desk, they said they needed IT to correct their website and that I should of request a king size bed. Why would I request a king size bed if your website states a king size bed in our room?? First day of our stay the AC thermostat broke, the engineer came to fix it and stated that the hotel is well aware of ongoing issue. Second day, after a long day out in NYC.. we went to shower and there was no running water. It took them more than 45 minutes to fix the problem. I had to let the water run for at least 20 mins because the color of water was green then yellow. It was so gross!! I didn’t even want to take a shower anymore. Third day, our AC thermostat broke again, after the engineer left the AC ran really loud the rest of our stay. It was so loud, it disrupted my sleep at night. Also we notice there was no ceiling above our door. A long rectangular piece was cut out, we could see the interior pipes of the hotel. I had a lot of anxiety that a rat would creep into our room at night. It was the worse feeling to have to pay almost $700 a night for what we experienced. I 100% regret selecting this hotel.

The Park Terrace Hotel met almost all of these musts and threw in a few extra perks along the way. The room was comfortable, clean, and a decent size by NYC standards. I could also tell that it was fairly new/updated and that whoever was cleaning each day was being very thorough in their efforts. My bathroom was SPOTLESS and, unlike many larger chain hotels in NYC - and especially in this neighborhood, the furnishings, carpet and shower were bright and cheery, not worn and tired. Free breakfast each morning was also a welcome surprise, with coffee, juice, and tea available alongside bagels, toast, donuts from Doughnut Plant, and charcuterie. So, why isn't this a five star review? There are a few - very small! - things that the Park Terrace can do to better cater to business travelers like myself in the future. The first is room service - I routinely end up working in my room after hours quite late and love having the option to call down to the kitchen for a bite to eat and a glass of wine. Yes, I know it's NYC and there are a million delivery options. But sometimes, surfing Caviar for a type of food, placing an order, and then running out to grab a drink (alcoholic or otherwise) is too much. Room service will take this place from good to great. The other small change I would make is providing reusable and clearly sterilized glass bottles in each room that guests can refill at the water stations located on each floor. I LOVE the idea of free water stations from an environmental perspective, but all that good will goes away once you realize that you're filling up a million different plastic bottles to take back to your room.

I really enjoyed my stay at the hotel and would consider returning. We stayed in a deluxe room which was fine for size. The only thing that would have improved the room was more storage space. This probably wouldn't be an issue for a short break but for two guests staying for a week we struggled to store everything and some of our things remained in our suitcases for the duration. The location of the hotel was great - you're in Midtown but not right in the thick of Times Sq which was what we wanted. That said it's only a short walk away. Due to its central location, The Park Terrace hotel is a great base from which to explore Manhattan. My only piece of constructive feedback to the hotel would be to try to improve the breakfast offering. The continental breakfast options were very nice but at times the restaurant was overrun with guests and there were not enough tables available to accommodate everyone at peak times. I also experienced quite a long wait for speciality coffees as there only seemed to be one barista during this time. This wasn't the barista's fault - he was severely backed up with orders and I had to wait over 15 minutes for a coffee. Had I not been tight on time to get to work this wouldn't have been so much of an issue. All in all, we had a good stay at the hotel and I would consider returning.","London, United Kingdom","nmurphy84</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,4.0

It’s a madhouse in the streets around Bryant Park so I was surprised how quiet our 4th floor room was (that had an angled view of Bryant Park). There was a gym downstairs and useful free washer / dryer that we took advantage of having accumulated a lot of laundry during our trip. One elevator wasn’t working for part of our stay leading to lengthy delays but the hotel positioned staff in the working elevator like the old days which was a charming old school touch.

Online booking was challenging as I booked two rooms but received confirmation for just one room. Called booking (...a bit of a challenge when calling from Europe as you cannot call 1-800-numbers from outside US and direct number was well hidden) and was told that apparently there were no two rooms in this booking category available anymore...they fixed that issue. I also asked for rooms nearby so we'd be close to our children. Upon arrival we were given two rooms but on different levels...well, kids are teens so it wasn't too much of an issue.Rooms were small but it's NYC and though they were small they were functional, nice and clean. The hotel is fairly new and there was still a lot of commotion with handymen being around all the time. Elevator wait times were ridiculous as they were also in use for construction/repair crews and had to be manually operated by staff members. Our rooms were on rather low levels so we used stairs most of the time. Had to leave one kid behind during the day bc not feeling well...received a panicky phone call from her as there was an unannounced fire drill, which was not declared as a drill immediately. That was a major fail and more so a very scary moment for the child. To top it off this was followed by another drill with sirens and lights flashing. Room service was lacking behind as we came to an unmade room after a long day out. Called, nothing happened for 45 mins, called again and room was quickly fixed minutes later.Location was absolutely great and convenient. Breakfast was very good. Artisan bagels and donuts, very good spreads and yummy fresh fruit. Lots of healthy choices. Nothing to complain about. Staff was absolutely lovely. They were young and beautiful people and super helpful. Everybody -including work crews- were very polite and friendly. Conclusion was that this was a great hotel with lovely staff in a great location. It will need a bit more time to run smoothly. Besides the hiccups, we would book again.

The hotel is in an ideal location, right next to Bryant Park, the staff are super friendly (girl with curly hair on reception always smiling and the lovely guys in the elevators too!), and the facilities are great (rooftop bar and gym). Best bits of the hotel: - There are multiple subway stops within a 5 minute walk. - The free breakfast which includes bagels from a local bakery and amazing donuts, fresh fruit and yoghurt. - The views of the surrounding buildings and park. - The bedding was insanely comfortable and soft. - Sliding 'Juliet Balcony' is amazing and was a huge positive on the hot days to get some fresh air in the room. - The shower had great water pressure and the bathroom was modern and spacious. - Gym has a Peloton bike which is cool!- Chilled water available on every floor with re-usuable bottles too. My only 2 negatives were the size of the bed (only Queen-size, and we prefer King), and the lifts were a little slow at busy times. Overall I would 100% recommend.

Location is always subjective but for us was a real plus (close to Times Sq but away of the most hectic parts while meters away from the subway). The hotel is almost new, design is clean and functional. The room was not so ample (room size was not informed at hotels.com) but it was very comfortable and well thought through. Breakfast is for free and although is low on proteins is above just ""good"". The dining room (which also serves as a bar / business center) space at the 6th floor provides good breathing with high ceilings and the sight of the park in front. But the aspect that makes the main difference is service: they are recruiting great people and seem to train them very well. From Katchiana, Gabriela and Charlie at the reception, through EVERYONE at the elevators and the breakfast area, they are all full of energy and genuinely willing to help you enjoy your stay. Only points to continue improving would be:- early check-in times- sizing of Team / counter at breakfast time may get limited - some park rooms have a less than partial view / some rooms on the 5th floor are probably noisy because of the bathrooms located in the aisleIn summary: we stayed at probably more than a dozen hotels in the wide Times Sq area, this is clearly the best we tried.","Perth, Australia","Diego P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",7,5.0

The staff, on the whole, tried their very best to please and assist wherever they could. The rooms are newly decorated and are tasteful, clean and a good size (we had a king with a sofa bed for three of us to share). They have a ""hydration station"" on each floor where you can go and fill up your reusable water bottle and get ice if you need (absolutely brilliant - European hotels should take this on board instead of charging people to stay alive). Due to refurbishment, the breakfast was a bit haphazard at times but offered everything you need to start your busy day on the NY streets. The location of the hotel is perfect as it puts you right in the centre of Manhattan, so you can easily go uptown, downtown or across town (either walking, public transport or taxi) and it overlooks Bryant Park which is a lovely little green area with loads of tables and chairs - free wifi too. Remember you pay tax on top of the published cost, so everything costs a little more than you thought and NYC is a very expensive place to visit. The best bit for me was the MET where you can buy a ticket on one day and use for the next two consecutive days, which is brilliant because it's huge and is packed full of loads that would be a shame to miss or try to cram into one day. I recommend the highline walk (an old disused raliway line, converted to a pleasurable walkway that avoids the traffic and runs for about 15 blocks). Take earplugs if you're not a sound sleeper as, even though the location of the hotel is not in Times Square, the all night construction and sirens can take their toll on a good night's sleep.

We finally decided to book “Park Terrace Hotel on Bryant Park” because of the picture for the “premier room with view” even if it was ranked 240th approximately at the time. From Expedia and the hotel website, the “premier room with view” appeared to be a corner room that has four floor-to-ceiling windows.However, we were disappointed as we were given a room on 5th floor and the room did not have four floor-to-ceiling windows. There was only one window. The layout of the room was like “deluxe room with view”. It was not a corner room, but it was the last room on the corridor.So we asked Randy when he brought us our luggage whether this room is a “premier room with view”.This reminded me of some comments on Expedia saying they were given “cheapest room” because they booked thought Expedia.We know we booked the room via Expedia with a discounted rate as it was non-refundable option. Which we would have lost almost £1,800 for a cancellation.After looking around the room we found a piece of broken glass on bathroom. So we looked closer and we found more shards of broken glass on one corner of the bathroom floor. We went to ask for someone to sweep these broken glass up. We were lucky that we did not take our shoes off when going in the bathroom. Imagine if we step on broken glass, our holiday would be cut short.Charlie was alarmed saying it was unacceptable and kindly offered us to move to another room which was the corner room on 8th floor that has four floor-to-ceiling windows.The room looked clean at the first glance. But we took no chance having saw broken glass on the floor of the previous room. So we inspected the room properly. There was no broken glass but there were thick layers of dust on many places such as on cabinet where the ice container was and in some corners of the wardrobe. There was a piece of plastic on the carpet which we assumed was part of a price tag on the floor from the previous guest. Which was not been picked up throughout our whole stay. We are now wondering whether it is still there now and if the room was ever vacuumed.The bathroom also looked clean but again we noticed the corner of shower cubicle had grime on despite the hotel supposed to be opened for just five months. There were some hairs on the floor and toilet too.We did not want to start our holidays being fussy or complaining, so we just wiped the bathroom floor by ourselves.We must be unlucky as we read the reviews from majority of customers saying their rooms were spotlessly clean.This is the reason we gave the hotel only 3 stars. Because everything else was perfect. Good room size. Good powered shower. Good quality bedding even the bed linen did not get changed throughout our seven nights stay. Good breakfast. Location of the hotel is great too. And the soundproofing between rooms works. We never heard our neighbouring rooms at all. We only occasionally heard sounds on corridors as there was quite a large gap at the bottom of the door. Majority of staff are friendly and helpful such as Charlie, Randy and the other we did not get their names. But if there is a spotlight award we would nominate Bronson from the restaurant who is multilingual with a great service-minded attitude. We watched him interact with hotel guests every morning which brightened our day. He is an asset of this hotel. We mentioned to him about our 19th anniversary and later cupcakes was left for us in our room. We thanked everyone. However we must not spoke clearly, we ended up having more cakes from Charlie a couple days later, which was a lovely touch.","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","Pook G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",4,3.0

I could not hear any street noise when the door was closed. I read some reviews about the rooms being small. Uh, duh, it’s New York City. Unless you can afford a sprawling suite overlooking Central Park, you’re going to have a small hotel room. It’s part of the experience. However, the layout and furniture at this hotel were definitely smart choices. I did not feel like I was crammed into a shoebox like I have felt at other hotels.

I figured it would be OK for a one-time stay, though was pleasantly surprised and will definitely stay again! It was all in the details for me:- The room was only slightly smaller than the Westin rooms - though was far more modern: modern, lighting wall pads- controlling all lights from next to the bed, Bose phone speaker/clock, Flat screen TV on wall- Free WIFI and Breakfast at the Terrace Bar. Also has a Gym!- Nespresso Coffee Maker, Nespresso Coffee Selection and Ceramic Expresso Cups- Beautiful Bathroom and shower w/Robes and nice products- ""Mini Bar"" selection- My Deluxe room on the 3rd floor overlooked a ""walking path"" with NO street traffic - so quiet!Overall, based on the room amenities, Terrace Bar, Free Breakfast and Outdoor terrace - I will stay again!","Laguna Niguel, United States","daniellehM1301XK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laguna Niguel, United States</strong>",1,5.0

All I got was a view of the building across the street. The front desk told me that the view of the building across the street was considered ""Park View"" from their interpretation. They did offer me a second move after my first move. I declined it after realizing the location of the hotel is not facing directly to the park. I wish they could change the misleading title of the room. To summarize my experience with this hotel:Pros: great location (near the subway station and Bryant Park), friendly staff, good breakfastCons: Even though it was a new hotel, not all facilities working properly (the drain wasn't working properly which flooded my floor. the door of the cabinet in the gym fell out but the staff put it back without securing it). Because this hotel was still under construction and obviously there was no service elevator, the guests had to share the ride with laundry, service carts... Be patient, it would take more time to get up and down so plan ahead if you are in a hurry. The billing system did not work properly. Check your bill carefully when you check out. If you check out in the evening, you may not be able to fix the mistakes in the bill (if any) because there was no manager on duty during that time.

It’s truly a hotel focused on quality. Everyone that worked at the hotel was incredibly professional and friendly. A special note to Gabriela at the receptionist desk for being super sweet to us. Park Terrace is a boutique hotel so the lobby is quaint but clean and welcoming. I booked a Deluxe Park View and thought the room was a very decent size for me and my daughter. Even compared to similar 4-Star hotels I’ve stayed at previously in Manhattan. Our room had a queen size bed and a small living room area with a sofa and table. The lighting, decor, and furniture are all very sleek and modern - equipped with a Nespresso machine, Bose speaker, and plenty of USB ports for charging. The bed and linens were extremely comfortable and though the bathroom is compact (normal for NYC), the rainfall shower was superb! I appreciated the in-room yoga mat and especially the hydration station on each floor - they provide empty water bottles that you can continually refill and take along with you which was convenient, saved me money, and reduced the waste of having to utilize multiple plastic bottles. We were provided with complimentary kettle corn and an orange soda in our room. The breakfast buffet was delicious with local pastry offerings but again quaint - no cooked meats, waffles, or pancakes. The hotel is in a fantastic location next to the Library and Bryant Park so an easy walk around Midtown, Times Square, Broadway, Central Park, and the subway (on the corner of 6th & 40th). We stayed in room 414 so a lower floor but also away from the elevators and it was quiet with only the occasional street noise. The elevators were a bit slow but not annoyingly so and the WIFI worked fine. This is my new go-to hotel in Manhattan and we will definitely stay again for our future visits.

Unbeknownst to me, after my boyfriend had told the hotel staff of his plan, the hotel had arranged a room upgrade for us before we came, giving us a fantastic view over the park. All of the staff were so pleasant to us while we were there. Every member of staff we saw was so incredibly helpful and polite, and all of their congratulations and well wishes were very much appreciated! The hotel was in a perfect spot, a great central location for so many of the attractions of the city. Walking distance to the buzz of Times Square, or a short walk to the ferry stop towards trendy Brooklyn- everything was close by! The complimentary breakfast was delicious every morning. So much choice and great to try the locally sourced foods. We hunted high and low for a Breads Bakery store to buy the granola- delicious!! The hotel had many touches which made it even more welcoming. The bar overlooking Bryant Park was a perfect place for a cocktail. The take away coffee available at breakfast each day, takeaway boxes for breakfast and the complimentary water bottles for you to take with you as we set off to explore the city. Thank you to all at the hotel for a great stay. We would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of visiting New York- we hope you enjoy it as much as we did!

The view from such a room is okay but a little underwhelming from the fourth floor. Perhaps when the rest of the hotel opens higher rooms will enjoy better views.At the start of the trip, arriving at the hotel after a seven hour flight, the colleague checking us in took a phone call while speaking with us. Further disappointment on getting to our room did we discover there was construction work still taking place on our floor - hammering and banging in a room just three doors away. The hotel does not mention this on their website. No one mentioned this in emails or even as a courtesy at the front desk when checking in. In fact, when I mentioned this to the front desk, they claimed to be completely oblivious to the work going on.Annoyingly, I had passed over The Parker (overlooking Central Park) which was available at a cheaper price at the time due to their open admission that their hotel is being refurbished. Had I known I was in for a half-finished hotel anyway, I may have chosen the cheaper option with a more iconic view.Staff, admittedly, tried to relocate us with an upgrade at a reduced cost ($50 a night). Views from the rooms available for the extra cost had a worse view.With the birthday in mind, I had emailed the hotel well in advance to try and set up something special. Initially, response was positive and, when chasing up was told ""it"" was with guest services. With this, I had expected something to be arranged - I had been prepared to pay. As it turns out, nothing was organised. Having seen quite how unfinished the hotel was - they do not yet provide room service - I had assumed this was not something they were yet offering so I was gutted to then find out on check out that the hotel offers a full menu of services for such occasions - floral decorations and more...in fact, a member of staff was wrapping gifts for another room at the desk at the time I was complaining.I had also, in my initial emailing and when checking in, specifically requested to pay in cash at the end of the stay rather than by the credit card I had supplied for security. I was told this was fine. A full two days prior to checking out, my card was charged. This charge was reversed but added another thing to have to sort out after having requested this multiple times.On checking out and in subsequent emailing I was offered a discounted upgrade the next time I stay with the hotel - which feels a little like a hollow gesture and one I don't think will be taken up. On the positive side, the hotel is in a great location and the quality of the rooms is acceptable. If you are looking in the area and at a similar price, for now I would recommend The Archer or The Refinery instead.At present, I would argue this hotel is not worth the price it is currently aiming for and it should focus more on nailing its customer service - having registered my disappointment at the start of and during the stay, it felt like no one really did anything to make sure things got better or to even proactively speak to us about how we were doing.Thankfully, we had a fantastic stay in spite of our experience at the hotel but a few simple courtesies could have made such a big difference.","London, United Kingdom","thebenhall</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",3,2.0

The relatively quiet location just a couple blocks off Times Square and adjacent to the library and Bryant Park is fantastic. Everything is brand new and clean, and the staff is remarkably friendly and helpful. They went out of their way to find us a last-minute dinner reservation on a Saturday and didn't mind us bringing takeout pizza into the lounge on a frigid winter night. The included breakfast is the best I've ever had, on par with a luxury hotel. The outdoor terrace, which has great views, would be fun in warmer weather. We got loads of value for the price. My only caveat: You'll want to share a room with someone you know well.

It just opened (Nov '18) and is a great location if you want to be near Bryant Park. (However, there are 15+ alternatives in a 5 block radius.) The noise was the biggest factor - there was street drilling going on well past midnight, it stopped right before 1am, and the windows are barely single pane (you can also feel the wind draft...having worked in the flat glass and fabrication space, they used among the lowest cost glass). Sleep was ruined for me, #1 factor in choosing a hotel (noise impacted several others - it was a big topic of conversation in the breakfast room the following morning). Also my room, 714, was by the elevator, and you hear constant dinging and other hallway noise. The rooms are very small, the classic is 200 SQ ft and the deluxe 235. The deluxe has no desk, no bath tub, just enough room to walk around. It's not a room you want to be in. The bathroom is also cheap - no shaving/makeup mirror, basic shower stall, no body wash (only bar soap). The room is very similar to the new hostel+ brand of Marriott, Moxy, and AC Hotels (European-inspired Courtyards). The problem is Park Terrace charges a luxury hotel rate. Overall it was incredibly frustrating given sleep was near impossible. Even if it were quiet, the room is small and not particularly nice IMO, especially given the luxury hotel price. Please don't be deceived by the fancy website with nice photos and reviews. (If you're fine with noise and get a rate of $200, then I suppose it wouldn't be a poor choice given location and smiling staff.)The towels and linens are nice, and the staff was social. The 6th floor lounge is nice, the breakfast selection is robust for a continental breakfast, and the breakfast staff is very helpful. The drinks at the bar are higher than some of the trendiest locations - an Old Fashioned was $21 and a small cup of nuts is an additional $9 even when ordering multiple drinks at the bar. I very much question the sustainability of the hotel as it currently prices and markets itself. Not sure whether they're the type to leave reviews, but there were several other unhappy guests as well. Hoping with feedback the owner better tunes product-market fit.There are several glowing reviews so maybe it's a great place for some. I wish I examined them more closely beforehand as several seem to be new TripAdvisor users with only 1 review so not sure what they are comparing to.",NYC,"andrewRH3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",27,2.0

This guy who helped me, didn’t explain anything, asked for the the credit card, gave my key and only said: ‘enjoy your stay’. I asked what is my room number?

If only this guy paid a little attention. I didn’t check his name, I should have. The concierge was kind enough to help, they are fixing it and it will be returned hopefully SOON.

I was able to check in an hour early and from the moment I walked in I had five star treatment. I was a bit disappointed that I did not have a view of the park ( thought I had booked a park view) but my room was spotless, and amenities nice. Complimentary bottled water and popcorn were a nice touch. The location is fabulous. I visited the sixth floor for a cocktail and appetizer ( they were out of the mushroom flatbread) and again the service was excellent. The best part of my stay was the breakfast.... the two gentlemen and woman working both days were outstanding. You can tell that even at 7am they love their job and take it seriously. The breakfast foods ( you will feel like you are in Europe) were fresh, delicious and healthy ( ok... maybe not the decadent coconut square doughnut) but it was worth every calorie!

The hotel appears to have installed good sound proofing. The breakfast was amazing -- perfect NYC bagels, specialty donuts, yogurt with granola and berries -- and was served in a beautiful room overlooking the park and NY Public Library. After breakfast, the amazing housekeeping manager packed up bagels for my daughter to take back to college. Such a nice touch!! From the hotel, it's a quick walk to Times Square and the train stations (Penn Station and Grand Central), and plenty of shopping along the way.

When I called to ask what the charge was, the lady said we had taken bottles of shampoo, hair conditioner, and body lotion, which cost a total of $105. We did not take anything from the hotel, so I said there must have been some confusion. I was on hold for a while, and she got back to me and said that they would refund me, but there was no explanation and no apology for the wrong charge at all. I got an impression that she still seemed to believe that we took them but was only giving us a refund out of courtesy...Even though they will refund me for the wrong charge, I am upset because I was suspected for something I didn’t do. They should’ve trained their housekeeping staff better to not make this kind of mistake in the first place, and they should’ve trained their receptionist better to handle this kind of situation smoothly.
