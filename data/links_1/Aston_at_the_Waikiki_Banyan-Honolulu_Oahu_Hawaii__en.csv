I did thorough research online and thought that this hotel had decent reviews and the pictures looked nice enough. However after checking in and coming to our room (1-2411) we realized we were essentially catfished by this hotel IT LOOKS NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURES!!! The room looks like something out of the 70’s and the furniture is completely falling apart, the bed is hard as a rock and has springs popping out and the shower looks like it is literally under construction and leaks. There’s bugs crawling around the floor I don’t even want to open my suitcase in fear they will enter it. We tried to talk to the front desk about possibly upgrading room or getting a refund and they refused and said they sell the room “for the view” what a complete RIP OFF. Besides that they also said the resort fee can’t be refunded and neither can the parking. This place is literally the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at and I’ve only been here for 2 hours. I expect a refund for the rest of my stay so I can go to a decent hotel and a refund on the resort fee and the rest of the parking days I have not used. The amount of time we have wasted trying to figure this out and stress from it merits this. I called Expedia to see if they can assist me (since I booked through them) in possibly getting a refund and they attempted to contact the hotel multiple times to no answer.

I think the both the hotel and herself would benefit from her switching to a position that doesn't require a professional and warm personality. The hotel room was so far from pictures provided, we went right back down to just check out as soon as we could and get a new hotel. Saudi was the most unhelpful ""customer service representative"" we've ever encountered. She insisted on dismissing us to just ""come back in the morning"" because apparently, according to her, all of the managers were off duty and there was no way to contact anyone higher up than herself to resolve our issue. Saudi didn't even offer to take our hotel keys or make note of our early check out. I had to tell her to make note that we returned our keys only hours after checking in and were not going to be using the room, so the management had record of our check out activity.

Parking is an additional cost. The workers at the front desk helped us to get a discount on the parking...just another example of how nice they are.This is probably one of the best locations for seeing to all that there is around Waikiki.

The first unit was slightly updated, aged but clean ""enough"". 2nd unit was old, not updated so there were stained counter-tops, stained bathtub walls, stained couch/sofa bed, dirty shower curtains, dirty walls with chipped paint. It was unbearable to look at and you feel dirty just being in the room.We asked why it's such a difference between the rooms, and I was told that it depends on each condo owner, some may want to update it more often than others, and they can select different levels of house-keeping services too. We got switched to a higher level room, it looked a bit better but the sofa bed was broken so we had to get a rollaway bed - you can feel every spring on that thing! the beds looked clean 'enough' but they were also very uncomfortable. I think the best place to sleep in that room was the actually on the couch cushion where there were no springs. The 3rd unit's bathroom door doesn't close, so it's always ajar when someone's in it - good thing it was just the family and we've established that if it's mostly closed with light, then knock first.The price is great, but apparently the airbnb standards varies a lot in Hawaii vs other places.

Meaning there seems to be several different accommodation businesses going on. Some private.....some Hotel....some through a tour company. We would never stay here again sadly, not through the Hotel anyway. There are private condos in the building you can rent through elsewhere that are updated and much better just be sure the Hotel staff does NOT have aces to your room as we had travel documents stolen right out of our room.BEWARE AND LOCK UP YOUR IMPORTANT PAPERS AND MONEYTHE NOT SO GOOD THINGS: The first room we were given had only a double bed and looked like a homeless shelter There were 3 of us and we are all tall and had booked Queen beds.I should add we booked this hotel far in advance and were supposed to have a Queen size bed. When we went to the front desk to ask for a different room, the front desk lady actually told us when you book there are NO GUARANTEES? like WTH does that even mean? In what universe can you not book a hotel of your choosing ? Isn't what size bed you would like a standard choice when booking a hotel? They gave us a different room, it had a Queen size bed and a pull out couch. The bedding however was only double so we had to ask for a second set so we could at least have a blanket each. The room was grungy....carpet badly stained, crappy old kitchen. Crappy old bathroom, the whole place was sub par as far as cleanliness went. The sofa was torn and dirty. It was actually laughable how horrible the room was. Both beds had terrible mattresses....The pullout bed especially terrible....we had to make a decision to sleep on the thin mattress with the metal bars sticking into your back OR pull the mattress onto the disgustingly dirty carpet? choices you should not have to make when your paying for your accommodation.If I thought I could get a refund and stay elsewhere we would have. AND to top it all off our water was turned off for a day with no compensation given AND they wanted to fumigate in our room WHILE we were staying in it? Claiming it would be of no harm to us? Last time I checked the kind of poison to kill bugs is rather harmful. There are MUCH Better hotels in the same area at a similar price point. Elevators not reliable broke down several times during our stay. At least theres a bunch of them...lol...however I was honestly afraid every time I got in if it was going to break down.THE GOOD: Location was great walking distance from everything really. Our second room had a decent viewLobby is niceThe pool area was nice and seemed well maintained. Pick your pool time wisely though there was a LOT of children...Not appropriate if you are looking for quiet poolside reading...lolThey have an awesome deck with BBQs ( Electric not gas) and a Tennis court etc.... also a cute little cafe I think must be owned privately. Really good cafe style food. The lobby was nice and the staff for the most part other that the lady when we first checked in were friendly and helpful. Even though the kitchen was disgusting it was nice to have a fridge and a coffee maker.Overall....we wouldn't stay here again. A massive update is needed, I get when your in Hawaii most time is spent outside of your room, but basic cleanliness and a reasonable comfortable sleep should not be set aside.","Nanaimo, Canada","Lalaj46</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nanaimo, Canada</strong>",3,2.0

If they show so little attention to basic maintenance, I certain shudder to think what I would have seen with a black light. There are no staff elevators so every time I got in the elevator I had to stop on the staff floors and often they would go 1-2 floors (without a cart). The hotel is 10 years past due for a renovation but assumes that just because they are in Waikiki that they can continue to operate on the cheap and fill up due to their location.

Daily cleaning service was good.Pool/Hot tub - Nice WARM pool. 2 Hot Tubs. Area was kept cleanCONS:It's a bit run down. Our room was outdated (I think probably depends on unit). The sofa bed needs to be replaced. It was actually pretty gross and was terrible for sleeping. Waiting for elevators at times was a BIG PAIN. We ended using the stairs a few times. This may seem trivial, but almost every time we were in the elevator - construction workers or staff were always trying to squeeze in with us with a lot of their stuff - was hard for guests to get in a lot of times.Would have been nice to have a decent restaurant/coffee shop on property.

We had a corner unit that had nice views of the mountains and even the ocean. The room is spacious, with a large living area, comfortable bedroom, fully equipped kitchen, and openable windows that enable a cross-breeze. Laundry facilities on every floor are convenient and even use the PayRange mobile app for payment without having to worry about quarters. In that sense, it's a great place to live with the convenience of being able to cook and do laundry, and currently a great value for the money.The trade-off is that the living spaces are very worn and tired, as the other reviews note. This may depend on the unit you get, but ragged window coverings, worn carpet, and the sliding doors and kitchen drawers and cabinets don't really operate smoothly. We also had to get rid of a few small bugs. The safe is old school with a key. It all works, but not attractively. Management responses indicate that a renewal plan is in the works, but that would still be a long way off.

We just caught a taxi back if we were too tired to walk. The lobby area was beautiful. I loved how it was open with a nice water feature / koi pond. There were 4 elevators in each tower so we never had to wait too long for an elevator. The rooms were a bit rundown, but they were still clean and well equipped. We also had a great selection of channels on the TV and the free wifi had a really strong signal in the rooms. Standard Rooms:One standard room had a great view of the mountain side of Waikiki, while the other overlooked the pool area. Both had a good size balcony, 2 x double beds, a sofa bed, full kitchen and bathroom. They were good sized rooms, so we were able to fit 5 people in one and 3 in the other.Ocean Deluxe View Room:This room was basically a standard room but on a higher floor. It was alot quieter on this floor though, but I personally wouldn't pay extra just for the ocean view as the view is obstructed by the Marriott Resort & Spa next door. You get similar view from the standard room at a more affordable price.The hotel offers parking, but we weren't able to use it as we hired a 15 Passenger Van which was too high for the parking lot. The pool and spa area was excellent, as well as the outdoor BBQs and the tennis / basketball court. We didn't have much interaction with staff during our stay, apart from checking in / out, but the staff we did see around the hotel were friendly and helpful. Each floor also has a laundry room with coin operated machines, you would have to bring / buy your own laundry powder.

Stayed on the 21st floor in the second tower. Dated room and furniture, 90s maybe? Noticed some of the rooms on the floor must be privately owned and looked a lot nicer. No breakfast or anything included but full kitchen so if you go for a small shop can have breakfast there. We had DVD rental included from a kiosk in the tower but the movies we rented kept pausing and skipping (probably from overuse). Location is ok, little bit of a walk to the “main” Waikiki area but if you don’t mind that it’s fine. Didn’t have time to use the pool area but had a look at it, again, average and a bit dated. If your not going to spend heaps of time in your room or the hotel then it’s a good enough stay I guess. Beds were firm and pillows were super thin.

I own a hotel & know that a guests satisfaction level is based on so many factors & personal expectations. I know first hand how hard it is to please everyone but this is far beyond personal expectations not being met therefore I felt compelled to write a review. We entered our room and the microwave was beeping with an error message that the panel needed to be replaced & front desk suggested unplugging it but the plug is locked behind a cupboard door. To make the beeping stop we had to turn the breaker off leaving us with a silent microwave but no functioning fridge. When accessing a plug to charge our phone, the lamp plug/cord exploded, split apart & shocked my husband. Went for a drink of water & the tap was spraying everywhere. This all happened within 30 minutes of checking in. The thought of having to spend the next 14 days here horrifies me. Nothing within the four walls of our room is inviting or comfortable or built/manufactured before the 1980’s. Hard beds, a pull out couch that is 8 inches higher at the bed head than at the foot of the bed, an air conditioner that is loud and totally ineffective. Went to front desk to speak to someone and after waiting over 5 minutes just walked away. Will try again in the morning.

No where in any of the advertising does it say this property is PET FRIENDLY for owner occupiers. Barking dogs was a regular occurrence.We drew the short straw and was checked in by Nina. Clearly this lady does not like her job and it shows with her attitude. On check-in I advised that we had just come from the Aston Banyan Maui. I further explained that I had left my medication at the property. There was no offer for Nina to contact the property and arrange for the medication to be sent. I contacted Maui on Tuesday afternoon. I was informed that housekeeping had not found my medication when the room was cleaned. I explained that I left it in the drawer in the vanity. As there were people in the room housekeeping were reluctant to disturb them. Clearly they did not understand it was prescription medication or they did not care. The following morning I spoke with management who told me they had recovered the medication and provided I agreed to pay the postage they would send. I explained that it needed to arrive on Waikiki by Friday as we were checking out Monday. When there was no of dispatch by Thursday I called again only to be told it would go to the Post Office that afternoon. I was told it only takes 1 day. Bottom line no medication and no charge to my credit card. Congratulation to the staff of Aston Banyan Maui for the apathy. I realise it was clearly my fault for leaving the medication however when reaching our for help it is expected that people in the service industry would be happy to help.We were given apartment 913 on check in. The owner of this property is not house proud. The furniture was old and uncomfortable (see photos). We asked Nina for a change of apartment. Her response was, doubtful we are fully booked. To avoid any further interaction Nina disappeared. We waited for her to returned and asked again. Nina advised that she would look at our request. She asked for a contact number and when told we only had our Australian cell phone number she said we would have to contact her as she can not call an overseas number. We were finally changed to apartment 2407. Not much better in terms of cleanliness however the furniture was a little newer and a lot more comfortable. We were told that this property become available as a guest of the owner had just cancelled. Apparently owner do not receive a daily service and someone at the front desk forgot to tell housekeeping and we did not receive service on day 1.Cliff provided fresh towels and toiletries however there was no offer of compensation for the lack of service. Servicing of the apartment is:Bed made daily and bathroom towels replaced.Rubbish removed.Bed linen changed every 3 days.There is a ""Resort Fee"" payable at the rate of $US 25.00 + tax per day which is payable in addition to the tariff. This fee covers tea and coffee, when they remember, DVD rental and use of Play Station, daily newspaper and WIFI. (Recommendation, refuse the items covered and do not pay the fee, there is no value. We had 2 days where the pool was closed. Attitude from the front desk was basically ""can't help bad luck"".WIFI not working one morning. A call to the front desk resulted in ""Yes we know, we are waiting for the manager to come in and re-set the password. He should be in around 10am. I asked they call me when the password was reset. No call by 1020am. I called the front desk requesting an update. I was informaed that the password had been reset and the call was terminated. The term reset indicates the password was changed. I called back only to be told it was the same password.With the exception of Cliff the entire team on the front desk need to trained in customer service. Cliff at least displayed empathy. The management of the Aston Banyan Waikiki need to ensure that apartment owners maintain a standard of furniture and cleanleness. Overall I have given this property a terrible rating as Trip Advisor do not offer a lower rating.Thank you management and staff of the Aston Banyon at Waikiki for making our holiday and stay stressful.","Sydney, Australia","BruceT400</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",3,1.0

Half way though our stay I was going to be running in the Hapalua Half Marathon and I wanted a kitchen to be able to cook meals prior to the race. Our room was on the 30th floor and was very quiet with terrific views of Diamond Head and Waikiki Beach. Reserving the room and check in were very easy and communicating with the property manager was prompt and courteous. An added bonus for us what that this unit was so quiet. When you combine the peacefulness of the room and the amazing views, we truly enjoyed our stay. The furnishings were up to date and the bed was very comfortable. The kitchen and bathroom were very functional and anything you needed for cooking was provided. As this was a private rental, there was no daily cleaning and no linen exchange. It would have been nice to have more towels but there was a coin operated laundry room just down the hall. We looked into using the outside grills but they required $2 worth of quarters and we didn't have them so we elected to just use the oven for our ribs and they turned out great. The room came with a parking pass which really helped as parking can be as high as $35/day elsewhere. The Banyan is located a long block away from the beach and closer to Kapiolani Park (Zoo) so it is a little removed from the hustle and bustle of central Waikiki which we liked. The room cost was very reasonable and it's hard to find another hotel with kitchen units and great views.

The first words out of our mouths was ‘what a dump’. The carpet was threadbare and wrinkled up, the curtains were ripped, the floor around the toilets creaky had not been cleaned and the bed had a definite dip in the middle. We left it for the night as we were too tired from our long flight. The next day they moved us at our request. This room had slightly more updated furniture and was cleaner with an ocean view and a much better bed. Still, there was repaired plaster everywhere and water damage in the bathroom. The next morning we didn’t get the newspaper included in our resort fee, nor did our room get serviced.That night we went to bed early as we had to be up early for a flight. In the middle of the night we heard someone trying to get into our room. Shortly after, the front desk called our room, asking for our names and that we shouldn’t be in that room. My husband went to the desk to have words with them, and got no apology or explanation. At checkout in the morning I refused to pay their so-called resort fee and listed my reasons why. The only response I received was ‘okay, thank you, okay’. I have not seen such abysmal customer service in a long time.The location is excellent, shame about the rest of it.

Our condo was spacious, clean, tastefully decorated and had all the kitchen necessities for preparing a meal. The bathroom was on the small side. The balcony offers a limited view of the ocean and more of the city, which is very scenic at night. Two double beds and a pull out sofa can accommodate 5 or 6 people. Beds were on the firm side, we didn't use the pull out sofa. Extra bedding and towels were available in the closet. Light colored drapes ensure that you are up with the sun so you don't spend vacation in bed! They are definitely not room darkening drapes. Washer and dryers were available at the end of the hall. An outdoor recreation area is on the 6th floor with outdoor grills, picnic tables, pool, hot tub, snack shack, tennis court and children's playground, there's probably more that I overlooked. The Banyan is one of the few properties that offers parking included in the rates, in the attached garage. A big plus as parking on the street is impossible and parking lots can be pricey.

We had four of us and they supplied an additional cot so our teens could sleep in the living room while we slept in the bedroom. Everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom. The pool and two hot tubs (hot and searing hot) were well kept. The DVD options were best in one tower over the other, so you might want to check each tower for their selections. Many things in the room needed to be 'fixed' while we were there, but they came immediately to deal with each issue. We were sold a package from the travel agent that said so many extras, but then when we got there, they claimed that they had never provided such things as slippers, or robes. Even the photos showed a very fancy room with granite kitchen top, but we got a room still functioning from the 80's decor, etc.  However, the travel agent claims they only sell what the properties provide info on, and therefore, we paid for and were expecting something that was simply not even offered. Whose fault is that??? We still had to pay the $25/night resort fee, which is pretty standard in Hawaii on top of what is paid to the travel agent.

It features floor to ceiling glass windows along one side with a lanai in the living room.It has sprinklers which are important in case of fire.The sink and mirror are outside of the bath and toilet area so it is convenient when 2 people are getting ready in the morning. There is only the one mirror in the suite which seems surprising. The kitchen area is well equipped but there is no kettle.The location is very good as it is only about a block from the Beach.The staff is helpful and courteous when you are actually dealing with them directly.We have done our best to give a balanced review of our recent stay at the Aston Waikiki Banyan Hotel.Now here is a detailed rundown of the negatives we experienced. Please see the photos to see what we mean.We're not certain if they have any renovated rooms but if you are considering this hotel then that would be a good question to ask.We had considered asking for another room but decided against it as the view was very nice and we had no guarantee that another room would be any better.1. The fridge is very old and disgusting where you open it up on the door handle and side of the fridge. The inside was clean and operational.2. There is no business office to use a computer but you may use the one computer and printer for a fee in the cafe on the main level of tower 2. It's only open until 5:00PM. The people in the cafe are helpful.3. The furnishings are very old and marked. The sofa, chair and kitchen seating were newer and clean and comfortable.4. There were no grab bars in the shower/tub. The old tub was oval shaped on the bottom and slippery so one of us used the rubber tub mat making sure that all of the suction cups were pushed down to prevent any movement. There were rust looking marks on the bottom of the tub. There were black mouldy looking areas along parts of the tub and wall and beneath the soap holder. There was deep ground dirt in the corner next to the tub. The shower curtain touched us as they have not installed the newer semi circular bath curtain bars. One day we noticed no hot water in the shower so we called the desk. We went out of the hotel and upon our return the problem had been fixed.5. There was a hole inside the microwave at the back. We just didn't use it.6. There were bugs seen in the bathroom late at night which had to be caught and disposed of into the toilet. There were bugs found almost daily on the kitchen counter and on the kitchen floor. No food was left out and everything was kept clean so we don't know how they got to the 25th floor although it is the tropics.7. The carpet has rolls in several areas.8. There was water built up next to the bathroom sink faucets all of the time. We kept mopping it up with paper towels.9. The bed had the old style bedspreads. Most hotels have had white bed covers for years now.Summation: The hotel has a wonderful indoor/outdoor lobby with lovely pictures of Hawaii and a waterfall with Koi fish. There is a cafe on the main level and a convenience store. On the 6th floor there is another fast food cafe, swimming pool, hot tubs, tennis courts and barbecues for rent. The house maids were nice and they did what they could. What these suites require is a very deep cleaning and to be renovated. Please note that parking is no longer free. It is $20.00 per day. Another convenience is that you may leave your luggage with the hotel after checking out on your last day.We would not stay here again for the many reasons given above but it would be a whole different scenario if they renovated the rooms.","Winnipeg, Canada","Ken J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Winnipeg, Canada</strong>",124,3.0

The condos adjoin the Aston Hotel but share common facilities. The condos are privately owned and managed separately from the hotel. We chose it because we wanted a bit more room than a hotel would offer.The condos are ‘animal friendly’ I understand, which probably explained the strong smell of carpet deodorant in the hallway approaching our apartment. However, first impressions showed the apartment as clean. There were welcoming chocolates. It has a new fridge and stove and was supplied with abundant towels. All communication was by phone. The apartment was not serviced.Furnishing were cheap and chipped in parts. Curtains had been hung by amateurs. The air con was noisy which added to the disadvantage in our location just above a busy corner.There were only 3 non matching wine glasses. One cup was heavily chipped and cracked. The kitchen bench drained away from the sink. The bath/shower was slow draining. We learnt to live with this wishing we were back in a better hotel.The Banyan has 2 towers of around 35 stories yet little had been spent on the vast pool/recreation area which was shabby. A barricade had been erected around the pool suggesting some renovation pending but with this number of rooms, a vastly bigger pool complex is required.Overall, disappointed but we should have checked further before booking.","Tauranga, New Zealand","327murray16</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tauranga, New Zealand</strong>",4,2.0

We get a good discount via a travel industry rate which helped. We just returned from a week stay, 2 adults, 2 kids aged 12 and 17. PROS: Very easy check-in, conveniently located to Waikiki Beach, 3-5 minute walk to stores and beach and restaurants. Easy to get into/out of parking garage. Large suite with separated bedroom and kitchen with dishes,etc.CONS: When I booked there was NO notice on their website regarding that the pool or hot tub would be out of service for our stay. We did not find this out(even at check-in, not mentioned) until our second day when we happened to see a note in the elevator. After the pool re-opened on our 4th day, the hot tub remained close for maintenance. It is advertised that they offer pool towels AND a snack shop. Neither of these were available so we had to go to Walmart to purchase towels to use at the beach and the pool. This was disappointing to say the least. I based my extensive research on hotels that offered a pool and chose this one only to have it closed for half of our stay.Maid service: We are typically low maintenance and only require a full room clean 2-3 times during a week stay. So, with that being said, one would think that when they maid did clean, she would do a better job then what was done. She LOVED leaving washcloths and toilet paper, we had accumulated probably at least 10 washcloths during our stay. But,little things like dusting and sugar packets for the coffee were neglected. When we made our boys beds up(1 couch and I loveseat that folded out), one of the sheets had a bright yellow huge stain on the sheet which we had to return to get a clean one. One of our master bed sheets had blood spots on it. All in all, I am unsure if I would stay again. Dated rooms but convenient, hard to choose. For us though, the price was right but most people would have to incur the $20 parking fee PLUS the $20 amenity fee.

They closed it to re-water the pool & to paint the patio area around the pool. They still were not done by the time we left. There was a false alarm one night about 11:30pm at night which they said was due to a new system. The whole bldg had to evacuate via the stairs (we were on the 22nd floor). They then made three more announcements in the room throughout the night. I think the last one was around 3am. There was a fight in the hallway late one night by other guests down the hall which also woke us up.

This was the last night of a trip to Hawaii with my wife and two friends why we wanted to make it a special one. Our friends who are Americans had made several nice arrangements during the trip why me and my wife wanted to return the favor and treat them with a nice last hotel stay by using a free hotel night earned as Hotels customers. We found the Aston which was discounted from USD 300/night, it looked very nice from the pictures, it was in our desired area, and it had received good reviews. With the discount the price was USD 180 which we paid using our points and direct payment through Hotels. After booking it we we're frankly thrilled to take our friends there.We arrived after flying in from another island around 7 pm. The entrance didn't look quite as expected from the pictures, but was fine. Already in the hallway to our room we got a bad feeling as it did not at all reflect the standard we expected from our booking. Entering the room we got a very unpleasant surprise. The room was far from prepared for guests with dishes in the sink, unmade beds, trash left in both the kitchen and the bathroom, and generally not cleaned. It frankly looked like a dump. Even worse, though, aside from the room not at all being prepared for our arrival, it was absolutely nothing like the pictures in terms of standard. It gave the impression of an old, outworn, dark xxx rather than anything else.When we got back to the reception the representative explained that the ""hotel"" consists of privately owned condominiums that are being rented out sort of as a hotel activity. Booking it through Hotels marketed as a hotel, this was not what we expected. Getting keys to a new room, our friends tried to comfort us saying that as the standard of condominiums can differ maybe this room would be nicer. It wasn't. Although the room this time was prepared, it far from reflected neither the pictures nor the price. We felt completely fooled and this was not at all how we've planned to spend our time in Hawaii before our afternoon flight the day after.We went back to the reception and explained that we simply couldn't stay. When asking for a refund, they informed us that the resort fee of USD 20/night would be refunded by them, but that the hotel charge would be between us and Hotels. When asking for our USD 20 parking fee back, they informed that the parking was separate from the hotel and something we would need to take with that company. So we did, but as that company had nothing to do with the hotel, it couldn't refund us although we only had our car parked for 40 min. Also a very unexpected turn of events as the information on Hotels stated parking for the hotel.As it was getting late and all we wanted was to get the situation resolved, we called the Hilton that has several resorts in the area and managed to get a room at one of the beach resorts. It was more than we had planned to pay, however, affordable if comparing with the ordinary rate for the Aston, and with a completely different standard both for the room and other hotel facilities.We've been quite frequent Hotels customers over the passed year, and have stayed at hotels with a quite diverse range in terms of pricing, standard, and US locations. Never before have we felt deceived or fooled, and yet we did quite a bit of research before making the booking in question.Due to the above, we expect to be refunded the amount charged for the booking, and also credited the free hotel night which value was used. Although we understand that Hotels would have no legal obligation to do so, we would also appreciate to be refunded the USD 20 parking fee (amount confirmed on Hotels sight for the Aston). Considering the additional charges for hotel and other parking, time wasted, and overall inconvenience of all this, it seems like a fair request.",,PehrE,2,1.0

I wished we hadn't far prefer being in a smaller room with greater facilities, right on the ocean front but that's me. The hotel/apartment is old and worn looking. We did this last minute via VBRO - so although a renovated apartment - it felt dirty and was small. in fact so small that in the middle of the night when I went to the toilet I slipped and fell backwards and hit my head on the bath. Dark, dingy corridors and dark reception area - not warm and welcoming like you would expect. On the plus side does come with a car space, the pool is a decent size, the coffee shop at the bottom does great coffees and you can find good deals via VBRO - but as ours was last minute wasn't such a great deal.I would not go back and would compromise on size and go for a hotel room with 2 x queen size beds and fold out sofa at Outrigger - just a step away from the Ocean.","Mosman, Australia","Travelbug49</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mosman, Australia</strong>",70,3.0

The sofa bed was so thin and uncomfortable. We ended up using the bedspreads from the beds as extra cushion to line the sofa bed. The kitchen was poorly stocked with only 1 pan, 1 pot and 1 cutting knife. All the furniture looked warn out.

We've stayed here before, two years ago. At that time we stayed in this hotel under Airbnb umbrella. We had such an awesome stay that we thought this time we will see what the hotel is like and booked a room for 3 nights. In future we will never choose to stay in this hotel as their guests. We would choose to go Airbnb. Disadvantages of staying as hotel's guests:-1/ You're up for a amenity fee - $20/ day on top of the room rate. The amenity fee covers a lot of things we didn't use like in-room complimentary tea & coffee; parking facility (if you choose to park overnight - the hotel will charge you for actually parking); safe in the room (this we used); wifi; daily newspaper; use of poolThis amenity charge is ridiculous. A lot of hotels around the US and world would not charge an amenity fee. We paid $850AUD total. Surely we shouldn't be subjected to an amenity fee when other hotels don't charge for use of a safe in the room, pool, complimentary in-room tea & coffee etc especially when the room rate isn't cheap. Amenity fee is definitely a turn-off and is a rude fee. The room (rm 2510) looked very, very dated. Given, we paid $850 for 3 nights, I would expect a fairly decent looking room. For a start, as soon as we walked in, there was a roller bed at the door. The furnishings didn't look professional/ nice as you would see in a hotel. Spot lights in the main room of the hotel room didn't work. It was dark. Thank goodness for the kitchen lights - They were bright enough to compensate! The table lamp in the lounge wasn't bright enough. Looking at the furnishings, we believe that this particular hotel room (2510) may have once been an Airbnb room but is now part of the hotel's. The bedroom was dark, there was only one table lamp to light up the entire room. Again, at least the lights at the vanity compensated a little. The safe was in the corner of the built-in wardrobe. But there was a big wardrobe in front of it, making it less than convenient to access. You have to squeeze yourself between the built-in wardrobe and the wardrobe. Crikey! The kitchen cabinets looks worn with tired wall paper covering it. Only good points about this hotel - its clean. The cleaners do a good job! Its close proximity to Waikiki main strip, Honolulu zoo, Honolulu Aquarium, beach, shopping and restaurants. I would return to this hotel only as an Airbnb user, not as a hotel guest! Then I would not be subjected to the amenity fee nor parking fee if we choose to rent a car for more than one day. Note: we had such a good stay at this hotel as an Airbnb user. It had better furnishings too. As a hotel guest, it was a total let-down. Maybe we had high expectations from the previous stay. The amenity fee is rude.

There were beach chairs, floatie devices, beach mats, towels, cooler, free parking, etc. Everything we needed for our time in Waikiki. I did give this property a 5/5 but I should mention that we did our own housekeeping and towel laundry. I can't remember if there was an option for housekeeping to come in or not. We did NOT mind this at all. Some might but it does not take away from how nice this condo was. We were also able to use everything in the hotel like pool, hot tub, tennis courts, basketball, etc. and also was able to book excursions through the concierge.

Don't waste your money, go to the plentiful ABC stores just down the street. If you want to wash and dry clothes have lots of quarters handy $2 bucks a load from memory. If you get parking included then that is also a bonus as parking at most Hotels range from $30-$50 a night.

The Banyan has a great location and the public areas are old but functional. Parking was included with the rooms. The elevators are very slow and smell. They do not provide luggage carts to haul your bags to and from your rooms. Plan to wash your own towels becasue its $15 for towel exchange and $70 for full maid service. There is a laundry room on each floor which is helpful. We had a bad experience with a miserable parking security guy that was extremely rude but that is likley isolated to that one jerk. When toilet paper, garbage bags , etc were required the Koko people in room 501 provided it easily. The 10th floor hallway smells like smoke. Not sure if smoking is allowed but its not pleasant to have to walk though several times a day. The doors to our rooms slam and squeak because they are old and the closers need to be replaced and the hinges serviced. They said they would have somoene repair one of the rooms but 10 days later no one has shown up. Its fairly easy to do and would prevent them from disturbing our neighbors. All rooms should have a drying rack in them. there is nothing to hang wet things on and you cant put anything on the Lanai. Room 813 has not been updated,other than the bathroom, but its in decent shape. It looks on to the pool. The hide a bed is horribly uncomfortable. This kitchen is lacking in utensils. When we arrived there were not adequate sheets for either room, even though we had indicated our needs in terms of single vs King beds. We arrived late and had to make due until morning when we had to go get sheets from Koko Resorts. No fitted sheets were ever provided so when they get pulled off every night you get to see the matress stains underneath. Gross and preventable. Room 1014 has been updated and isnt too bad but it has mold in the shower, the towel bar falls down if you put two towels on it, the interior doors dont slide properly, the bathroom door wont close properly, the king bed is back breakingly uncomfortable, but worst of all you are located on a street corner and the windows are single pane and you hear everything going on. The late night drunks , the big trucks in the morning, the Harley's that roar by keep you awake and disturb relaxation. This room's kitchen is well stocked with utensils, it looks not too bad and it does have a decent partial ocean view. Overall the place is an OK value for a budget conscious choice but there are a few fairly simple cost effective things they could do in the rooms to make it acceptable and cause people to return to these units every time.

The property is in a good position - only 200 metres to the beach. The view from the room was stunning. You could sit on the balcony and watch the Sun set over the Pacific each afternoon. The pool is small. The one hour that has been given over to people who would like to swim laps was a lovely bonusThe staff at the Reception Desk and the housekeeping staff were very helpful.However, the room was very dated. The carpet was significantly worn. It is time that this room ( and probably many others ) had a complete makeover. Recent cosmetic jobs ( such as a recent painting of the apartment ) were not enough. New kitchen and new furniture are desperately needed. It was also strange that there is not free wifi in the building.Still, the stay at the Aston Waikiki Banyan was a pleasurable one.","Sydney, Australia","Leylandbros</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",25,3.0

There is no washer or dryer in the unit, however, there were washer and dryers at the end of the hall on our floor, and we used these the night prior to our departure. The pool and hot tub was out of service during our visit and we were allowed to use the pool at another Aston property near by.

I have to say even though lots of reviews state how dated the place is, I have to say I actually loved the building. And yes the building is very dated, very seventies, however the aircon worked fine and didn't make a noise, stayed on 33rd floor in tower 2 and the mountain view was just beautiful, the view changing constantly. Great location easy walk most places. Room was so quite, no building or traffic noise. ""BUT"" the issue was the people working there, no one seemed happy working there. Generally I would say staff were uncaring, unhelpful and lacking in any empathy with no interest in the customer at all. Arrived after 12 hour flight from Australia (at 6.45 am Sunday in the morning) The girl on reception was totally vacuous and uninterested, said we would need to come back at 3pm, that's fine so we come back at 2.45 pm and the girl says no room isn't ready, we sit in a corner like good guests. Taxi after taxi arrives, guests are checked in a shuffle off to their respective rooms. Finally we ask at 3.15 and are told ""housekeeping has a problem"" but we can go up .... the problem was a light bulb needed changing.After numerous poor interactions over several days with unhelpful, uninterested staff I finally vented to a nice young man on the desk one evening who was kind and did listen to me and treat me with empathy. He arranged for me to see the manager (Ivory) the following day. Ivory was also responsive and caring, and I am grateful for her response.

This is my take....this is a huge condo complex that is managed by owners and property managers. Don't expect luxury, but expect clean and comfy. The bad reviews were people who booked directly through the condo complex or other obscure people. We booked through Koko Resorts! Highly recommend them!! FREE parking....FREE internet!

We have a young family so really need to use facilities where we can cook meals.The positives of the banyan:- it was in a great location for what we needed; only 2 blocks from the part of the beach where we normally take the kids (near the break wall where it is calmer for the kids to swim). We were about 2 mins walk from the trolley and bus stop too which was good. 10 mins walk to the food pantry (only supermarket in Waikiki) and just around the corner from the Marriott where all the tours pick up and drop off from.- the view from our room was great; we were on level 27 of tower 2 straight up the mountain so at night time the kids got to see ""fairly land"" and of a day the clouds over the mountains were beautiful. Got a great breeze.- the little minimart was convenient for water and late night snacks - they also had a cafe but we didn't use it but they served some healthy options like chia porridges etc- pool was very basic but the kids loved it, small spa, BBQ facilities and a small playground (all old and in need of a facelift but useable)- kitchen facilities were in working order and there was enough of everything to cook a meal and eat it.- we didn't use them but there was a PlayStation and also you could get DVDs to watch from a rental desk at no charge.Negatives: - The hotel itself was way overpriced for the quality of the hotel. It is in major need of a facelift. It smelled like my Nan's holiday house - old and smelly, the furniture had burn marks in the fabric, the carpet was old and dirty with burn marks in it.- the hotel staff were not really friendly or welcoming and spent a lot of time talking to each other or on their mobile phones- the tour desk operators were ok at booking but were really bad at customer service and were not very friendly, clocked off at exactly 5 and were annoyed if you were still there trying to finalise a booking. There was no follow up from them when you returned from your tours to see what you thought. They too spent a lot of time on their cell phones texting.- the room configuration was a bit odd. The bedroom had a door to separate the bedroom from the living area but the aircon was in the lounge area, so if the door was closed (which we had to do every night to give the kids a good sleep) it was stinking hot in the bedroom. There were no fans in the bedroom- the bathroom was like being on a cruise ship (toilet almost in the shower), small bath/shower big enough for a child to bath.- the bath towels were about the size of a tea towel and really poor quality- the block out curtains in the bedroom had deteriorated so there was no blocking out of sun - up with the sunrise for us- at 8 am in the morning on the 2 days we managed to sleep in (the first two days) we were greeted with drilling next to our bedroom wall. Apparently they were doing renovations and fire alarm upgrades which we only found out when we asked them about the noise. They did blame the building owners and wouldn't take responsibility ( they however did waive ½ the amenities fee of $100).","Sydney, Australia","Phoenixandshoos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",12,3.0

Regular price was $25.00 per day in Waikiki.I went there with my wife in late November in 2014 and stayed for 8 nights( Sort of an old story ).They offered us a very nice room on the top (38th) floor faced to Ala Wai Canal. It was gorgeously furnished. Dining table was so large and it had a beautiful brown marble tabletop.We were so happy to spend time in the room until 'IT' happened.The first night, when we were preparing our meals and were almost ready to eat, I found something was moving at a corner of the tabletop, and I realised it was a tiny little roach! Oh my gosh!After we found one, they appeared one after another. We gave up eating on the GORGEOUS LARGE table.Only one drawer below the table was locked with key, and we couldn't open, which we thought the owner of the room used it. I was sure THAT was where the roaches came from.Thus, we fought roaches with my whole body gooseflesh and caught over 10 of them. All of them were shorter than half an inch.Next morning, I told the story at the front desk, and they told us they would clean the room during the day when we would be out.When we went back to the room, quickly I found one on the ceiling. I called the front desk and they sent a room-keeping guy. The guy brought a bottle of insecticide and stood on the table with his SHOES ON and caught it with my help. Since the tabletop was brown, tiny roaches were hardly visible and I had to look tangential to the tabletop to find them.I asked the guy wether they had cleaned the room on the day or not. He called the front desk and asked about it. The answer was, ... ""They FORGOT."" ""WOW!"" I was at a loss and didn't feel like becoming angry. I asked the guy to leave the insecticide, and he left it with a piece of advice. That was like, ""It has a strong smell. So you'd better use it before you go out."" I couldn't help using it when we were at the room. They appeared in the kitchen and the bathroom.Thus and thus, I fought them with a strong chemical weapon over night. (The 2nd night)Again, next morning, we requested the front desk to clean the room during the day, and we went to Waikele Shopping Center for the Black Friday bargain.We went back to the room early in the next morning and we fell asleep soon.........I woke up late in the morning and I found a roach in our bedroom. OH MY GOSH! They finally INVADED our bedroom! I could not put up with the situation ANY MORE! I was exhausted from ""the Roach Fight"".I called the front desk and requested to change the room.They told us they would offer a grade-up room, and we packed our baggage and moved. But we didn't think we'd got a grade-up room. Because, the first room where we fought roaches was on the top 38th floor with beautiful mountain view, but the second room was on the 33rd floor with PARTIAL PARTIAL ocean view and was much smaller.Anyway, we were released from the fear of roaches and could eat and sleep with ease after spending our precious 3 days of our 8-night stay in Hawaii struggling with roaches.The second room was based on white, so we would be able to find roaches easily if they appeared. But they never appeared this time.Otherwise, we love this condo very much and made a great Hawaiian memory of our life.I think I WILL stay here again next time if I can afford to.Thank you!MAHALO.Share review Edit review Delete review","Sagamihara, Japan","Hiro O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sagamihara, Japan</strong>",15,3.0

We needed the refrigerator to keep her wedding flowers chilled. Love the new furniture and a family of four would be very comfortable. Staff is very friendly and accommodating.

There was really only one plus with staying here - the location. It's pretty handy to Waikiki. There were a lot of minuses, unfortunately... The rooms are all extremely dated and very worn & tired. While everything is still (mostly) functional, it's also ready for the scrap bin. The furniture was very well worn and smelled a little funky and the bottom of our lounge chair broke when it was sat on. The carpet was horribly stained - it looked like a Jackson Pollock painting and a full bottle of red wine had been spilled on it at some stage.Every time we cooked, we set the smoke detector off. The extractor fan over the stove is pretty much there for decoration only. We even set the smoke detector off in the corridor once, luckily it didn't force an evacuation, although this did happen one morning (somebody in another room burnt their toast apparently).Although an oven is provided, no oven-proof cookware is, so you either have to buy your own, or cook on the stove-top. We also had no kettle for boiling water.We used the outdoor BBQ area a couple of times (mainly to avoid setting the smoke alarms off!), but the security guards are particularly over-zealous in policing the ""no bottle"" rule. The second time we used the area, we were forced to leave as we had a glass bottle of salad dressing. At the same time, a Japanese family were also forced to leave (the wife in tears) as they had a bottle of wine. I can understand the need for safety, but a little common sense and courtesy goes a long way and the BBQ area is well separated from the pool area.Coin-op laundry facilities are provided, but are expensive at $2/wash and then $2/dry and they only take quarters.The elevators also became a nuisance - they were slow, one of them constantly malfunctioned (which the staff were aware of, but it never got fixed while I was there) and the cleaning staff also used the guest elevators - not really an issue (I realise they need to move between floors too!) but their carts took up the entire elevator and they used the elevators a lot... The water pressure in the shower was non-existent - we had to use the pulse setting on the shower head, otherwise the water just dribbled out.The rooms are also extremely noisy - road noise and sirens go on 24/7. Even on the 26th floor, the sirens woke us up. There was also a lot of maintenance going on, with somebody on the floors above using a hammer drill most days, starting at about 0800, which wasn't appreciated. The curtains are also pretty ineffective at keeping light out, so sleeping during the day was difficult (we were on shift work).Overall, this place needs some serious work and I wouldn't recommend staying here until it's done. There are nicer places for a similar price in the same area.",Auckland,"aldous2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland</strong>",73,2.0

The staff was very helpful but at our arrival I didn’t feel a warm welcome but after that everything was fine. We enjoyed the pool area and wish we would have taken advantage of the BBQ pits that they have available on the hotel premises.

It's a few blocks to Waikiki, and they have a little convenience store next to the elevators. The view from my first room was incredible, Diamond Head and partial ocean view, but the room itself was bland with tacky furniture. I checked with the front desk and they said I could look at another room the next day. I received excellent customer service from the following employees: Ihilani, Jasmine, Cliff and the property manager. I moved to a different room the next day which was better than the first. I guess I was expecting a more 'resort' type place. Went to the pool one day but left after a few minutes because there is a playground right next to the pool and the kids were yelling (just being kids) but it was just too noisy.

The rest of the unit was spacious enough with a living room area, dining area and a galley kitchen. The kitchen was a bit old and tired but everything worked.The airconditioner worked very well. The soundproofing in the rooms was excellent. We were right next to the guest laundry which also housed two huge electrical boxes which hummed loudly but we didn't hear any of it in the unit, nor was there any noise from the corridor or other rooms. I was very impressed with that.There was a small balcony that overlooked (from 13 floors up) the pool area and provided a great view across to Diamond Head.The staff were friendly and helpful and I would happily stay there again.","Albany, Australia","Nozza2014</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany, Australia</strong>",17,4.0

Although, there was no oil, and salt and pepper, but Safeway is just a 3-5 minute drive away. There is a $20 accommodation fee per night, but it's alright. Towels were changed daily, and bar of soaps were provided and left when needed. Towels can be borrowed on floor number 5. Wifi connection is 8/10, but sometimes buffers. Parking is not part of the hotel fee and is $20 a day, but apparently that is the cheapest around here. We bumped into a couple who said their hotel parking is $30.

The particular room we had was older style with no upgrades however we were told each room is still individually owned by people so that is not up to the Banyan to control upgrades. The only down side was our room was missing a few basic items and one element on the stove was broken. The room only contained one frying pan, no spatula only large spoons for cooking, no toaster and one pan for the oven. It was fully equipped with all cutlery, dishes, cups, rice cooker, cutting board, chopping knifes and can opener. The bed was comfortable and the air conditioning worked very well. We never used the DVD rental which was part of the resort fee. Housekeeping did a very nice job of cleaning and we always had fresh towels. We did not have a recycling bin only a garbage can. Loved the location of the building it was near the beach and beach walk and quieter as it was not on the beach. It's very close to bus stops.

I don't think the Banyan is trying to be a cheap low priced hotel, but this room was not that far from that. This room wasn't cheap, and was far from the beach and center of Waikiki, so for the price it should have been a bit nicer. I should add that the location is as quiet as it gets in Waikiki.

There is also a small snack bar that opens at 11AM daily. That helps instead to going to your room for a drink. I met some people for the first time and they have helped me with reservations for years. They were so nice to me and I am thrilled that we finally got a chance to meet. I am looking forward to my trip in 2016 and I definitely will book the Banyan. Can't wait to go back.","Malden, Mass","leialoha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Malden, Mass</strong>",22,5.0

We decide to book 5 condo units at the Banyan. The units we booked were through Aston Hotels & Resorts, but all units are individually owned and decorated. I did have a chance to visit all 5 units and definitely different décor, but all good quality.All the one bedrooms have a full kitchen, with some having an island and some a table with 4 chairs. Our unit was well furnished with two twin beds (larger ones tho) and a pull out couch in the living room. Ceiling fan in the bedroom and air conditioning unit in the living room - not the most effective, but glad we had it.When we first arrived, we were greeted by a baby cockroach....overall we saw 3 in the first 2 days and nothing after that. They do have a good program to control these and really....we are in a tropical climate so we were ok. Had there been more moving forward we would have said something. Obviously all food items went into the fridge!Bathroom was good and we had enough towels. The biggest negative was the wifi.....there is wifi in each unit and is included in the nightly amenity fee you pay (which also gives you access to dvd/video game rentals). The wifi was so awful that there was no point in using it.....all 5 units complained about the same issue....there was no resolution....just the way it is.The adult and kids enjoyed the pool deck on the 6th floor. You can get pool towels on the 5th floor of tower 2. The pool is nice as well as the two hot tubs. We never made use of the many barbeques on the deck, but saw many families enjoying bbq dinner. We did make use of the basketball court....they have a basketball you can rent for $3.00/??hr....we ended up going to a local Walmart and buying one for $6.00.There is bank machine, little coffee/snack shop and small convenience store on the main floor near tower 1.I would definitely recommend an early visit to Costco to buy food, liquor and even souvenir chocolates kona coffee, etc at killer prices. It's worth renting a car for the day or even cabbing it.Overall we enjoyed our Ocean View unit in tower 2 and the Waikiki Banyan. Having the kitchen gave us the flexibility to eat in if we wanted to even if it was just for breakfasts.","Edmonton, Canada","YEG111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",40,5.0

And there is one single fold out bed readied in our room. So the number tallied.We came back from dinner late with 3 young children and just when we were ready to put them to bed and set up sofa bed, we found a big writing on the bottom part of the sofa bed 'broken do not use'.because the kids were tired, we made a makeshift bed on the floor using sofa cushion.Not long after, we discovered the toilet was blocked and didn't flush.We didn't report this as we were tired and didn't want to have anyone fixing toilet when the kids we're asleep.We waited till morning to use the toilet at the lobby. Only to be told by this rude concierge lady that I had to get the key from the front desk (front desk being the same long desk that she was standing at but minded by different ladies that happened to serve another customers)I asked if she can get it for us instead and told her that our toilet was blocked since last night and that we have waited till morning to use the lobby toilet. Her answer 'I understand that, you just have to ask the front desk' I don't think she understands the duty of concierge !!!! She wasn't serving another guess or anything just staring into her computer screen.As that happened, one of the front desk lady finished with the customer and when I asked for the key, she grabbed it from the desk, the same desk that concierge lady could take few steps, grabbed and gave it to me.We reported the problem in the morning and they sent additional 2 fold out beds to make up for the broken sofa bed. And they did unblocked the toilet.Despite that I'm still giving this place terrible rating as the price, the facilities, and the service just don't match.We stayed at the sister hotel Aston sunset (next door to banyan) a week before and was very happy !!!

The queen bed was not a queen bed, but rather a double bed. If having two adults on a dbl bed for almost two weeks doesn't sound uncomfortable enough, the fact that the springs from the mattress kept digging into every part of our bodies should. The pull out sofa bed was bigger than the bed in the room, but in worse shape. Our poor 8 year old was even more uncomfortable then us. The stove burners had issues heating up. Just took forever to simply boil water. Seeing as we've stayed here 3 times prior to this stay it's safe to say that we've had decent experiences. Yes the rooms decor have always been dated and we have never cared. However after the very uncomfortable stay this time I regret to say I don't see us returning and risking a repeat experience. I would also like to add that my sister and her family stayed in a room down the hall from us and they also had similar bed issues. The carpet in their room was disgusting and their room had a smell that despite my stuffed nose from my cold still invaded my sinuses and made me want to gag. I once recommended to people that this was an average place worth considering. Now I'd be hard pressed to recommend the Banyan. The reasoning given is always it's the individual owners, but why would you even put guests up in a room with beds that are nothing but springs??.  I will say that my encounters with the staff was very pleasant. Front desk personnel, Maintenance, housekeeping, parking and coffee shop employees all very friendly and helpful.

We took a lot of effort to find accommodation that had three separate beds, as nobody wants to share a bed with anyone else. So when we turned up at 11 pm after a very long flight to find a room with two large singles pushed together to make a big bed and a rollaway bed, something had to be done straight away. To the hotels credit, another rollaway was found and the next day the smaller beds were separated.The unit was large and had a very well equipped kitchen.What rankled was the $18 per night ""facilities charge"" which covered the internet, a daily newspaper, the pool and DVD hire and a PS3. Interent access is standard. Don't charge me extra for it. The newspaper was $1 per issue. The DVD rentals skipped sections of the movie, and as they were from as machine and some clown had put the wrong movie back in the wrong slot wouldn't give me the movie I wanted. The PS3 handset was broken so I couldn't play some of the DVD's I wanted anyway, and if you happened to choose a BlueRay disk needed a degree to figure out how to make it work.All in all, I was charged for things that didn't work, or I didn't need or which are standard. I had thought I had prepaid everything and it was a bit of a shock. I'm not sure what would have happened if I had declined to accept the charge at check in.The hotel needs a bit of a spruce up in general.

We were told that our rooms would not be ready until after 3pm, that's fine, sometimes that's the way it is. The main reason we stayed here is because of recommendations about the great recreation and pool area for the kids. Well, we check in and get to our room, it's nothing fancy, but clean. Kids can't wait to get to the pool... Here is where it all goes downhill! We get to the pool 4 adults and 7 kids, security is patrolling the pool like hawks... I've worked hotel security, including at the 5 star 4 Seasons and wonder what is going on, because it almost seems like the pool is under a lockdown. They come over to us and tell us our kids can't jump or dive in the pool. We tell security that we see the two boys jumping and diving, and they are not in our party. Security tells us, well we are telling everyone. Ok, a little odd, but we let it go and brush it off. Next, the security guard stands close to us for 10 minutes watching our kids swim... Not a very relaxing feeling. We just informed them that the two boys doing it, are NOT with our party! Guard then returns again and tells us that our 9yo son needs to leave the pool and can't swim because he has scars and a few open sores on his legs. Really??? He has an allergy to grass and has some scars on his legs. No ""open"" sores, but maybe 2 small spots where his skin is lighter in color because it's healing. All adults in our party are in disbelief! This is a soccer team and some of the kids have bumps and bruises.., it happens during sports! Are they all not allowed to swim? I'm sure they can find a cut or wound on every single person in the hotel! We have spent over $800 dollars and my son is now crying and heartbroken. Because he has to sit and watch the other kids swim for 4 days? Not to mention that he had an allergy that has been treated, but is now made to feel like he is some sort of disease carrier or criminal? If we weren't so busy with the upcoming tournament, we would checkout immediately and demand a refund. This kind of blatant discrimination against a child was appalling and unacceptable!!!

We rented Unit 1211 Bldg 1 through Jackie at Hawaiian Vacation Condo. While her pricing seems a bit more than other rental agencies, she was a delight to deal with and always responded to my emails, issues and questions promptly. The unit we rented was exactly like in the photos and was nicely updated with a view of the Rec Dec. It was very clean and also had a beach bag and cooler and a few lawn chairs and if you are a golfer there were golf clubs there as well. The only negative of this unit was that it is advertised that the condo has beach towels yet we were only supplied only 2 of them - but we were a family of 4? Had I known this prior to arriving I would have packed some vs having to go buy more towels that I didn't need. No biggee but a tad annoying. Also the pull out couch of this unit is advertised as being brand new but it was atrocious and about an inch thick. My husband ended up just sleeping on the sofa itself and we put each of the kids on a blow up mattress in the bedroom as we like to stay up later than them so it wouldn't have worked to put them on the couch. Again we didn't pay for a 5 star so you get what you pay for. The building itself is dated and the rec deck was fine - we just used the pool in the afternoon and never visited the snack shack. It was nice being in building 1 and being close to the pool as well. The location was also just a quick hop skip and a jump into town which was great and close to the beach and the free parking was a real bonus. I'm not sure we would chose this property again only because I enjoy an ocean view and the sights and sounds of the ocean. But for families with young kids on a budget you can't beat this property and I highly recommend Jackie at Hawaiian Vacation Condos!","Port Moody, Canada","Kristi M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Moody, Canada</strong>",26,3.0

I stayed in the same unit managed by an outside condo rental agency as some of the units in this hotel are privately owned and not managed by the hotel. That is my disclaimer, now for the review.First off do not expect posh, posh here in Waikiki will cost you about $500/ night. This hotel is very nicely located 1 block from the beach and there are many dining and shopping options within easy walking distance. The Zoo is about 4 blocks away, easily walkable and there are trolly stops all over the place so getting around is really not an issue. There is an attached parking garage which will cost you $20 / night if you have a car unless you rent one of the privately owned units with a parking pass like I got. The hotel itself is in good condition and is clean throughout though a bit dated, which is fine by me. There is a nice pool area with a basketball court and pay electric grills (yes I said PAY electric grills) which cost $2 for an hour., REALLY Banyan? Ridiculous. Overall I have been happy with the hotel in my 12 weeks there but I am pretty easy to please. I am not really sure what the hotel charges per night directly through them but all things considered I am sure its a good value and bang for the buck probably one of the best spots in Waikiki.","Westlake, Ohio","ScottGlass67</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Westlake, Ohio</strong>",9,4.0

We enjoyed the beach and went swimming as much as possible while we are there. A short block and a half away and we were on the beautiful sandy beach in Waikiki. The hotel room was exceptionally large with a separate area for the double beds. This area could be closed off to the rest of the condo which was great. The kitchen area was new with granite counter tops and all new appliances. The bathroom sink and vanity were separated from the tub and toilet which made if very practical for all of us. The room was an end room facing the beach............we didn't noticed this until the next morning and were pleasantly surprised. In short, we liked our hotel, which is older but renovated, and the proximity to beach, shops, grocery stores was great. Housekeeping was done daily but little later in the day which made sleeping in possible. The only major complaint was the we encounter some bugs. In my opinion they are to be expected but my daughters weren't fond of them. It's my belief that bugs are common in warmer climate and I would think there was something wrong if there weren't any. The hotel also has a few amenities such as a nice pool deck with a hot tub, tennis court and an area for families to grill. In this location they also had a little snack bar that served a variety of treats including shaved ice. Also on the first floor was a wonderful cafe where many of the foods were made from scratch. We enjoyed the tasty fried rice and the delicious coconut cake. The ambiance there was so wonderful, calm and relaxing, that we found ourselves going quite often. We also had access to a dvd rental machine. We could choose some of the latest releases. We often rented some movies and ordered in, to enjoy a relaxing evening in the hotel. For the most part the staff was efficient and friendly. Whenever we needed anything they were quick to come to the room.I would come to this hotel/condo again and would love to have the same room even though it wasn't on the top floor, the sea views were still stunning.Thanks to the hotel and staff for our wonderful stay!Smiles to you all!!","Victoria, Bc","EED1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Bc</strong>",19,4.0

Rented via Koko resorts: had access to lawn chairs/mats, surf board, boogie boards (remnants left behind from previous guests, thus selection can vary), beach towels. The unit was more spacious than a typical hotel unit and accommodated 5 of us. Access to the full kitchen was convenient. Safeway is within short drive. Staff at Koko resorts were friendly. Pool & hot tub on the 6th floor was handy on a rainy day. Parking & wifi were included with the rental fee: all fees were upfront so no surprises at the check out. Had one set of coin operated washer & dryer for the 22nd floor: 2$ to wash & 2.25$ to dry. The bad: Very noisy with combined effects of constructions at nearby buildings, ambulance & police sirens blaring at any time of the day, tour buses loading & unloading people in the middle of the night and constant & heavy traffic noise. Had a partial view of the mountains and the beach between high rises but we didn't spend much time indoors. No housekeeping service. One towel/linen exchange per week. No exchange for beach towels. The ugly: The unit had powerful odor of what seemed like remnants of urine, vomit and perhaps mice & mold. Did not use anything without washing first. The bedroom ceiling had a huge water mark, bath tub was surrounded by dark mold lines, the kitchen cupboards were stained with mysterious brown marks. Old& smelly carpets in the unit. The sofa bed had one sorry excuse of a mattress with springs sticking out all over. The sofa and the mattress smelled so badly that the smell permeated into our clothing: had to use towels to cover over before sitting down. It was too late for us to find alternative lodging without creating extra stress so we ended up staying. The air conditioner in the living room worked but was so noisy that we had to sleep with the window open which meant sleeping with the all the noise from the outside. For an added touch we had chain smokers in a unit nearby that added frequent smell of cigarette smoking blowing into our unit.

As we had stayed there before and the rental agent we worked with was so very nice, we did not read the reviews. A big mistake.The unit is beautiful-up on the top floor with an excellent view of Waikiki. It is definitely neglected and is in need of some TLC. The first thing we noticed was the mirrors , glass door, and windows were covered with streaks. I could not even see myself when trying to put on makeup. Next we saw all the counters covered with dust. Shower handle was broken. We could only take cold showers. In addition there was a broken toilet seat and broken ironing board. The unit came with only one set of pily mismatched sheets. Since I did not bring my computer, I did not see their email (3 days after checkin) offering to exchange linens and towels for a fee. Instead we were forced to spend time and money washing the few towels they gave us. This email also gave us the opportunity to have the unit cleaned for a charge. Even though this was the only rental that did not offer housekeeping during an 11 day stay, we would have paid to have it cleaned since we already paid 4 times the price being Christmas.The next day I called the management company at least 4 times. The only answer I got was ""we are busy"". On the fifth call I finally got to speak to someone. The nice reservationist no longer worked there (no surprise!). The person I spoke to told me that I do not know how to work the shower. How rude! They finally offered to send someone to look at it. Although he could not fix it, he adjusted it to a reasonable temperature. They gave me the phone number for housekeeping. The housekeeper came to clean and dust. They used something on the dresser that turned the wood white. When I asked about pool towels, I was told they did not provide. I have never been to any hotel or condo that did not provide pool towels.On top of this, we were charged a check out cleaning fee. I never heard of this one.This just goes to show. I should have done my homework and read reviews. I would have seen other reviews mentioning how responsive Hawaiian Paradise Resorts are before they get your money.

The room was clean and a decent size, and with a full sized kitchen which we appreciated.The staff were always helpful and the location suited us.

Sparks flew and we could have been hurt (and our dinner was ruined, as there were bits of metal in it), but the stove was repaired and the frypan replaced.The most disappointing thing for us, and the reason for our poor review, is that my son's ipod went missing from the room one day when we were out. He was quite upset, as being a 13 year old he is very attached to it, and had paid for it with his own money. The staff helped me to submit an incident report, but on our return home, the insurers responded to say that essentially because it wasn't in the security box, they had no liability and it was not covered. We felt that given it was in a locked room only accessible by hotel staff, we had a reasonable expectation that it should still be there on our return, and the fact that there is no consequence for the hotel for its loss, may indicate a culture of acceptance of items going missing.Ultimately I would not stay at this hotel again, and could not recommend it, due to the risk of loss of personal items.","Adelaide, Australia","kathryn o</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",4,2.0

The key card to get into the room sometimes did not work or took numerous times to work one of the light globes in the bathroom did not work,the shower curtain rail was old and rusted and when having a shower and closing the shower curtain you could barley see yourself. the door to the bathroom did not close properly nor lock. the air conditioner was a bit loud also the fridge. the oven and the microwave light up the room with the time display so we had to cover them with tea towels. another thing the door to the balcony was a bit stiff and when sitting on the balcony water from other air conditioners/ balcony's would drip down onto our balcony meaning the tiles were always wet and slippery. also considering it can fit up to 5 people there was only two chairs to sit on the balcony. and one time they changed the sheet it had some sort of stain that looked like glue. and the doors separating the lounge and the bedroom did not move well on the tracks and would get stuck same with the wardrobe. a few tips to improve on would just be the little things as i have mentioned but despite the size of the room the bathroom is to small and i suggest that instead of separating the sink and the shower and toilet that you connect them and make one big bathroom. other than that it was all good and we had an enjoyable stay.","Adelaide, Australia","Harrison W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Adelaide, Australia</strong>",29,3.0

Now the downside, The hotel needs a major facelift, the pool deck is large but the constant noise from work being done drove me to hang out at the Honolulu Elk's Lodge, fortunately I'm an Elk's member. Our room was like walking into the past. Crapy bamboo furniture, smoked glass mirrors, linoleum floors, blackout drapes so worn they don't work. No fitness center.

It was definitely family friendly, on the sixth level you had a pool, two spas and a small playground. As well as an outdoor barbequing area which we used a few times. We also paid the 10 dollars US to get unlimited local calls, the daily paper, wi fi and a movie card that allowed us to borrow movies and games from a machine. We were provided with a playstation two in our room as well as a tv and dvd player.

And we certainly felt like locals. This was a return trip to Hawaii and while we have stayed at numerous Oahu hotels and condos over 30 years we always feel a warm welcome with Aston. Upon arrival we were greeted by Jonathan who truly exemplifies the spirit of the islands. He was friendly and professional and was so concerned that we were going to have the best holiday. We stayed in Tower 2 unit 2209. This unit faces the mountains. We got the morning sun and enjoyed the cool shade of the afternoon when the temperatures reached 85+. The unit was an individually owned condo within the Aston inventory of suites. We have also stayed at the Aston Sunset and all 3 times the units were decorated identically. At the Banyan the rental pool of suites does not seem to have a standardized interior. However we appreciated the fact that we had 2 double beds and a fully equipped kitchen. The unit also had black out drapes which really kept the room cool. The location is so handy to the beach and to Kapiolani Park. This end of Waikiki is quieter. We booked with the extended stay package which provides once a week housekeeping but we could exchange our towels for fresh ones anytime by going to the 5th floor housekeeping. This package saves $ and the daily amenity fee is not added to the rate. That saved us $18 a day. No Wifi but free internet available at so many locations nearby (ie Starbucks, Royal Hawaiian centre, Mcdonalds). Nice to ""unplug"" and focus on Hawaii and not the computer! The Banyan gets 5 * for staff and location. The units need some refreshing (hopefully like the sister property Sunset) so for that reason only 3.5* We will return and hope to stay with Aston again.

Just for starters, the service was great, the cleaners did a good job, and the location was great, a 1 block walk to the beach, even with grandkids in tow or a hired longboard under the ram wasn't a hassle. We didn't have a noise problem, but we did find a wind problem on the pool deck, one of the kids water floats actually took off! Where we found issues, mostly niggly ones, was with the building itself. It needs a major refreshing. As others have said, ongoing water maintenance works mean water is shut off from entire sections of the building regularly, the hall outside our room was undergoing repairs of some sort, and looked like a bomb site, the laundry was in pretty sad condition, the lifts were eternally slow, as they couldn't get us all on one floor, despite a 6 months in advance booking, we seemed to be forever waiting for a lift. In our rooms, the wardrobe and dividing doors were forever falling off their tracks and getting stuck, the fold-out beds were very lumpy and the springs stuck out, very uncomfortable to sleep on, although the actual beds were fine. Our TV remote didn't work, so we ended up not using the TV for the entire 10 days. We did make use of the wifi, but agree with others, $18 a night is a bit steep. Still, we had a pleasant stay, and if there was just 2 of us and no need for a fold out bed, we'd probably stay here again, units closer to the beach were just too expensive for us as an extended family.","Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia","Glen C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia</strong>",12,3.0

Were not dumb.We got there too early, room wasn't ready, and the sink drain had to be repaired, delaying check in. It happens, can't always get lucky and get your room early. Could have requested a different room, but i didn't. Glad we waited as the room was very, very nice and the view even better. This was the 4th or 5th time here at the Banyan. Rooms are independently owned, some are great, some not as great. Some people want a restaurant or a bar in the hotel, and take off for that. I don't want one in my hotel. Too much noise. Do you really want a room above an open bar with a band at night? No.This was as quiet as it gets in Waikiki. It was quiet. AC was quiet too. Elevators were fast, waits were very short. Our room had a memory form mattress. I liked it. About half the furniture was nicely styled, the other half was awful. The worst of the '70's and '80's. The cabinets were solid maple. Very nice. The floor was laminate Koa wood. Fake of course, but it looked great. Real wood would not hold up well in a hotel room, and Koa is too rare anyway. This is the floor I would have put in the room!The best part was the mountain view corner room. 2-3515. Could also see much of Diamond and a bit of ocean too. The mountains are beautiful day and night. Not to far from the beach, or too close either. Not related to the Banyan, but Waikiki has just gotten too expensive, and it just isn't as nice as it was.

The Front Desk staff and Bell Desk staff were friendly and accommodating. We were informed upon check in that we’d been upgraded so we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves on the 29th floor with a fabulous ocean view! The room itself, 1-2902, was updated, clean and well maintained. Some of the reviews I’ve read portrayed the hotel as old, outdated and rundown but I’m pleased to say that we did not find that to be the case at all. We have stayed here once before about 8 years ago and found the accommodations quite comfortable at that time. However, this time around we were more than a little anxious about space because our daughters are all adults now (24, 22, 19) and the thought of 4 grown women sharing one tiny bathroom was a bit disconcerting. Chalk it up to being in a relaxed vacation mode but we had absolutely no issues. The beds in the bedroom were very comfortable, but the sofa bed and roll-a-way bed, which was brought in for our 5th person, were not. Our daughters rotated each night so they took turns sleeping on those beds. Back when they were younger this was not an issue but as adults they definitely noticed.We did not have a rental car so we walked down to the Pantry market on Kuhio. A little pricier than the mainland (especially milk…yikes!) but very convenient and they have just about everything you’d need to stock the kitchen for your stay. The kitchen is well equipped with utensils, dishes, pots, pans, etc. One thing our unit did not have was a baking sheet. I made biscuits for breakfast one day and had to improvise so it turned out fine. There is also a little market next to the Tower I elevators that has a nice little variety of grocery items. We made a daily stop there for ice cream and other goodies. We visited the pool/recreation area a couple of times and found it to be clean and well-kept. The water was pleasant…not too hot, not too cold. The hot tubs were full the two times we went so we never got to try them out. The Housekeeping staff responded quickly to requests for extra towels, etc. My only issue would be the inconsistent timing of their daily visits. One day, they would arrive before we’d even left for the morning and the next day we wouldn’t see them until close to 4:00 in the afternoon.We DID have some excitement during our stay. The fire alarm sounded on the afternoon of the 26th, followed immediately by an announcement to evacuate. I work at a high school so I am so used to fire alarms going off that I didn’t take it seriously at first, but the Housekeeping attendant in the hall was quite insistent that this was not some kind of drill. Fortunately we were all together and we proceeded to stairwell. Remember our fabulous upgrade? Yeah, not so fabulous when you have to descend 29 flights of stairs! We smelled smoke (but didn’t see any) at around the 20th floor, but the guests and residents kept their heads and we calmly exited the hotel and crossed the street. One poor lady was in a robe with her head wrapped in a towel…she still had conditioner in her hair, poor thing! There were multiple fire trucks in the street and maybe a couple dozen firemen – that I could see, anyway. I was amazed by how many knuckleheads were still in the hotel, looking down at us from their balconies. The whole event did last very long at all and we were soon given the “all clear” to return to our rooms...by elevator this time! This was our first hotel evacuation and I was very impressed by how organized and professional the Banyan staff were. Kudos to the Fire Dept. as well! Thankfully no one was hurt and all things considered it was a minor inconvenience.I can’t say enough about the Waikiki Banyan staff. Absolutely first rate, every single person we encountered. The location is perfect...a short walk to the beach and shopping, but just beyond the noisy hustle and bustle.

The room itself was badly in need of a makeover and looked like no maintenance had been done in 20 or more years. While we were there the toilet cistern started to leak on the floor and had to be replaced. This was done promptly but with another old one. A table lamp in the lounge had been broken (ceramic base) and then glued together, the curtain rods were rusty and there were small repairs done on the bath edges to prevent water running on the floor while showering.

Thankfully they were all proved wrong by our week long stay at the property. Although the one bedroom apartment was a little outdated, it was well stocked with cutlery, dishes and so on. There was a full kitchen (oven, microwave, kettle, coffee maker), and a quick trip to Walmart (roughly 10-15mn drive) stocked the cupboards for the week. As a family of three (all adults), the configuration that we asked for originally (one double in the bedroom and a foldout in the lounge) was not respected despite giving months of advance warning, but we were able to shift one of the two beds in the bedroom into the lounge area and still have plenty of room to move around. I do understand that it is hard to manage rooms on a daily basis, but I would have thought the advance notice given in this case was enough.We had an ocean view room, and it was simply awesome to wake up to a view of Waikiki Beach and a little sliver of Diamond Head. Note that there is a charge for Wifi and rental of the Playstation etc for movies ($18 per night, I believe), as well as a charge for parking, which can be paid for on a weekly basis (my memory is pointing to the $80 USD mark on this count). The hotel is located nice and close to the beach, and possesses both a pool and a sauna, as well as two hot tubs and a tennis court.As a travel agent (specialising in NZ and Australia, so I should point out that I don't sell or have any professional connections to this property or any in Hawaii/USA for that matter), I would recommend this accommodation to friends, family and anyone looking for a relatively low budget, reliable apartment hotel.A final note, there was a power cut to the block the hotel is on whilst we were staying, the staff handled the event very well with minimal disruption, letting people know what was going on with the speaker system within the hotel itself and directing them to the torches in their rooms.","Dunedin, New Zealand","Ebony H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dunedin, New Zealand</strong>",8,4.0

Very close to the beach, and yet the price per night is relatively fair compared to other hotels. The lobby of the hotel is quite nice, it is conjoined with the outdoors, bringing the indoors out! The lady that checked us in was undoubtedly the nicest hotel staff member I have ever had the pleasure of talking too. The halls of the hotel are very outdated, raggedy old red carpets, strange green walls, and highly humid, stuffy, unairconditioned corridors are not a real comfortable place to be. The rooms are actually quite nice. Nothing fancy, but the size is great, balconies just an added bonus! Now this building used to be a condo complex, changed into a hotel. So all rooms do have kitchens, depending on whether you like to pinch pennies or not, this may be a plus or negative. The plus side is you can go to the shops and buy enough coffee and groceries to make sandwiches and fruit salad for breakfast every morning. The downside with having a kitchen in a place where people come and go is cockroaches. Even though you may not see one on your stay here, they are most likely there, we had a lot in our kitchen, and house keeping had to come and spray twice during our one week stay. It's no secret we were slightly paranoid about brining these guys home, we shook off all our clothes and threw them in the direr before we left, and washed everything immediately when we got home. To Summarize, this is a hotel with spacious rooms, great staff, perfect location, fair price, but comes with the cost of outdated corridors, slightly outdated rooms, and bugs.

Stayed here 9 days. Took the advice of previous reviews and asked for ""high in tower 2"". Managed to get 36 floor... and though the view was nice, the 30 year old decor could stand a refresh. We had a family of 4 in the room and the provided a cot so we had the little one on the pull out, another on the cot, and the 2 adults in a queen size. a little cramped, but was fine for the most part. Didn't experience the the construction issues at all. I don't want to take away from the great people that work here. Everybody was very nice, and very helpful. Very professional staff. If i could rate the staff alone, they'd b a 5. Probably the most disturbing part was the bar-b-que's. They're electric and cost $2 per hour. you'll waste the first hour getting heat out of it. And if you work for the hotel and your reading this... get rid of the cockroaches in the cooking area. that will help improve the ratings... Location is perfect. Not every bus stops there, but they all stop very close. we walked to the beach every day... very enjoyable. The coffee shop is an asset. for the east coasters... they open extremely early. had my morning coffee at 5am every morning. better than trying to brew a pot in the room. Overall, we like the location and people... the accomodations need a refresh and a serious scrubbing. Tile shouldn't be sticky!Loved Hawaii and will return at my earliest convenience.

The lobby areas are quite nice. I know that some of these rooms are individually owned (and rented out as time shares and such). We were part of a tour group, and had approximately 60 people staying on several floors. The room that I was in had a sofa that needed recovering. The fabric was so worn through that it was shredded and you could see the cushion material/stuffing poking through. The carpet was worn, but clean. The countertop was chipped, and had been patched. The wallpaper and paint was chipped on corners where bags most likely bumped into them going in and out of the bedroom.Our room had 2 twin beds (which was fine for me and my roommate). They weren't the most comfortable, but were adequate. We were so tired from our adventures that we really didn't notice. We had plenty of towels, and pillows. However, that sofa really bugged me. I asked the front desk to cover it with a sheet or something, as it looked scratchy and uncomfortable. We didn't spend much time in our room, so it wasn't so bad. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Waikiki beach. The bus line has a stop just off of Kuhio and Ohua, so mass transit was easy. The Bus drivers were kind and courteous and rather helpful.The hotel lacks a restaurant, but seeing how as it is more an apartment/condo building(s) than hotel, that isn't too surprising. If the room had better accommodations (wifi $18? Really?), I would have given it 4-5 stars. The state of the sofa and chair were bad enough that it really knocked down the rating.

The pool is big enough to do small laps and the spa was relaxing. There's a normal spa and a 'hotter' spa for warmer temperatures which is great! We loved the hotter spa, especially at night. The only downside is that there is no gym in the building. Apparently you get discounts at a nearby gym but that's not the most convenient when you just want a quick work out.The resort fee includes use of the pool/spa, PS3 in your room, a DVD card to rent movies for free, free wifi in your condo (you have your own router in the condo).

Management, staff and security refused to call emergency. During the hour of being stuck in that elevator staff would yell to them ""do not to call 911""and ""just wait!"" While being stuck in the elevator my parent's phone didn't work and would cut off so they were not able to call 911 anyways. They got so sick waiting and my handicap bother had to defecate on the floor. People in trapped enclosed and in sick condition should wait for emergency, not wait for lazy ""elevator man"" to take his time to arrive. I suppose my family is lucky none of them didn't have a panic attack, seizure, or die which could have very well happened thanks to your ""just wait"" treatment. Even after 30 min of being stuck personnel and staff refused to call the fire department or emergency! When I called security pleading them to call the fire department after 30 min of of being trapped, I was threatened by security James ""if we called emergency, you'll be charged over $800.00!"" then he hang up.Hotel guests should not be charged forced tortured and get sick in a stuck elevator! By absolutely no means did the management, staff, or security handle the situation professionally. Clearly there was no rush to help these people stuck getting tired and sick in the elevator. Security and management were also trying to blame ""traffic"" for the long wait. That entire island can be circled within an hour. Clearly there was no rush to help these people stuck getting tired and sick in the elevator. It practically took and hour before some ""elevator man"" even set foot on the property. The treatment towards my family was disgusting torture and absolutely unacceptable! What should have happened was the fire department should have been called immediately to get trapped people out of a malfunctioning elevator first, then call the ""elevator man"" to fix the malfunction. Instead security and staff wanted the convenience of fixing the elevator while making my family sick waiting inside it because it was cheaper! Sham on the security management, and staff who were more worried about the elevator rather than the human lives trapped in it. I'm sure if it were your family members stuck in an elevator, you would not leave them to wait for some lazy ""elevator man""..","San Francisco, California","Karma K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",21,1.0

And it was even better to know that our tourist are treated with equal hospitality.There are washer/dryers on floors, seven (7) and above. This is a great convenience as we had taken advantage of the beach and pool facilities so we had wet suits.The location is also very good as it is right off Kapahulu Avenue. You don't have to go throughthe Kalakaua traffic. It's close to the zoo.We noticed there is a very large recreation area. There are a number of gas grills available for cooking. This is a good idea for families with children. We had a very relaxing staycation and would do it again at this resort.","Honolulu, Hawaii","denise808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",49,4.0

The second room was in the first tower and wasn't nearly as good as the previous one. The sofa bed in the second room was so uncomfortable, if I was staying more than one night, I would have insisted on a room change, it was terrible. The floors in both rooms needed to be better cleaned, I had black soles on my feet just by walking barefoot. The second bathroom, still had sand in it.

I had chosen the Banyan because of Koko Resorts, the property manager for this condo. They were very friendly and helpful. We got a free parking pass and they have towels, beach chairs, etc. It is first come, first serve but they always had plenty of stuff. The location is a short walk to the beach and town.

We decided to stay at the Waikiki Banyan again as we really enjoyed it last time and found it good value for money. Like last time, we booked through Koko Resorts which was so easy. The condo we stayed in last year wasn't available so we decided to go a bit higher and booked the Penthouse - Room 3710. We arrived really early from Sydney, so took our bags to Level 5 where Koko Resorts have their office and was told that they would try and get our room cleaned by 1pm and to come back then. The thing I love most about booking with Koko Resorts is that you are given a key code after final balance is paid, so when our room was ready (which was at 1.15pm), we headed up to our room, punched in the code and walked straight in. There is no-one to tip and no front desk to have to deal with. On first impression our room was a bit smaller than last year, but it was clean and neat. It really could do with a bit of a renovation, as it is dated, but overall was comfortable and everything seemed to work. It has a decent LCD TV. The view from the 37th floor was amazing and we spent a bit of time on the balcony. The bathroom was OK, a little small but I think this is the case with all of the condos. The shower was nice though. The bathroom door didn't slide shut but there is another door off where the vanity is so you could close that. Beds were pretty comfy, but the pillows were flat. We used the free parking when we hired a car and the free WiFi is always a bonus. There is also air conditioning in the room. I must also mention the lovely coffee shop downstairs - we love eating here, especially breakfast. Nearly every morning we ordered bagels and the homemade banana/choc chip muffin - so yummy! My sister and I come to Hawaii to shop, so we don't want to spend our money on expensive accommodation. The Banyan is only around 3.5 stars, but at the end of the day its comfortable and clean. Its close to the beach, local buses and lots of restaurants, and its not amongst all the hussle and bussle, which is really nice. There's a food pantry not far away and ABC stores in every direction. Denny's is also a short walk and great for breakfast or cheap meals anytime of the day. We ordered $4 all you can eat pancakes quite a few times :)Overall if you have high expectations, you might be a little disappointed. But if you want a bit of extra space, a fully self contained kitchen and can put up with a bit of dated furniture, then this is the place to stay. I would definitely have no hesitation in coming back again (in fact we are planning another trip next year) and will book with Koko Resorts.",SYDNEY,"debthommo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>SYDNEY</strong>",13,3.0

Reading the reviews I was leery but happily my personal experience was wonderful. Aston Banyan is in a great location.Close to beach(short 2 blk walk), good restaurants (so many options!), the zoo & Kapiolani Park. We could easily walk with our toddler, surfboard and beach gear and be on my favorite beach location on Waikiki in 5 minutes. Parking was $12 for 24 hrs which is an excellent deal. Our room was 2307 and the view of Manoa Valley, Wa'ahila Ridge State Recreation Area, Kaimuki, & at night the city lights was breath taking. The room was spacious and the kitchen was well supplied with all the kitchen tool necessities. The refrigerator was icy cold and the ice trays in the freezer were frozen and fresh. A nice touch. The room was very clean and lovely. AC was modern and worked great. We had a 2 TV's and a DVD, game station & VCR. There is a $15 per day resort fee. Which covers beach towels, free DVD check out,coffee & tea for your room, & paper at your door every morning. I utilized all they offered and felt it was a good value. The beds were basic but linens were clean and pillows were soft.The kitchen table and chairs were wood and very comfortable. The couch and chair in the livingroom were new and also very comfortable. (I live in Oahu and have had it with wicker furniture, so uncomfortable!) So I really appreciate any furniture that is not wicker...The lanai was roomy and the outdoor furniture was comfortable. Our room was cleaned daily and everything we needed was always restocked. Granted this is not a modern luxury resort, BUT! I also did not find it terribly outdated.The gorgeous art in the Lobby,( huge oil canvases), wood art carving in lobby and in elevators, simple botanical drawings in my room, nice bath soap and shampoo's, all nice touches which I appreciated. What the Waikiki Banyan offers is a great value and convienance. The pool, hot tubs, tennis courts, basketball courts, practice putting green, childs playground were awesome! We had a blast! The BBQ area is so nice. Great grills ($2 per hr, quarters needed), tile countertops, plenty of seating, a great community vibe as family & friends from all over the world grill & wine & dine. The lobby was lovely, complete with a friendly & helpful front desk and a tranquil Koi Pond. The convienance store had a great selection of wine, beer, ready made snacks and lots of whatever you need. The coffee shop in the lobby offered a great selection of beverages and had a good vibe to it as well. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely return.","Eugene, Oregon","BASTMSMSS3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eugene, Oregon</strong>",1,5.0

As expected (thanks to Trip Advisor reviews!), we were not surprized that the decor was so out of date. We requested Tower 1 as Tower 2 was under renovations (to the outside at least). We were given room 1713 which was spacious, albeit worn and badly in need of an update, but our views made up for it. Our tower was edge on to Waikiki Beach and the end rooms - the 13s and 14s on each floor - had an extra added view of Waikiki Beach from our bedroom, bathroom and kitchen windows. Our lanai faced toward Diamond Head, but the hotel next to ours obscurred our view. We had a kitchen with stove, fridge, microwave and utensils. We made a run to Walmart to stock up on breakfast supplies and had lots of choices of restaurants within a few minutes walk. We were the second block away from Waikiki Beach and could walk it easily in 2 minutes, but found the sand hard and quite uncomfortable to sit in, even with the $2 beach mats we bought at Walmart. I couldn't justify renting a lounger for $40/day. We couldn't resist the great pool, comfie lounge chairs and double hot tub on our 6th floor of our hotel. If you really didn't feel like eating out, you could use the barbeque on the same floor. $2 got you an hour of cooking time. The only complaint we had was that we had an incident with the dryer on our floor. We put in a load of whites the second night we were there and heard the dryer making a horrible racket. We checked on our clothes and flound black marks over most of them. We called the front desk to report the dryer mishap so no one else would wreck their vacation clothes. A security fellow was sent up to take our report, take photos of the clothes and set a value for the damaged clothes. Two days later we hadn't heard anything about the clothes so we checked at the front desk. We were sent to the security office and had to explain the situation again, only to be told no report had been filed and that WE should have asked the fellow that took our information, took pictures and wrote down our name/room number to FILE a report. Seriously ...!!! The maintenance man who happened to be visiting the security men said ""Oh, yeh, I checked that dryer and nothing was wrong."" so I asked the obvious question, that if a report hadn't been filed, as we had thought it was, WHY would he have gone up to check on the dryer? It was like talking to a brick wall. All we were told was no report was filed and we would have to file a report and did we want to file a report. Duh ... yeh, we did. Minutes later another security man came to our room, took our information, took pictures - just like the first guy - and this time I specifically requested that he FILE the report he just made. We were told to check back the next morning as he needed the night to get the report filed. The next morning we inquired at the front desk where we should go to ""check on the report"" as the security fellow requested and found out the office was closed all Saturday and Sunday. Hmmm ... we were checking out on Tuesday morning, so at least we still had Monday. Monday we went back to the office to check on the progress of our report and waited for 15 minutes for the receptionist to find the report and check with her supervisor (who we suspect was hiding around the corner). We were told a maintenance man would need to check out the dryer and once they got his report they would see IF we were eligible for any credit. We told them the maintenance man had already checked it out and found nothing and we needed a response from them asap as we were leaving the next morning. The receptionist ducked around the corner and was sent back with the news that the procedure had to be followed and if they couldn't find a problem with the dryer they couldn't do anything for us. I pointed out that the dryer issue happened 5 days earlier so what good would it do to check it out again NOW? What would it prove? We totally felt like we were getting the soft shoe shuffle and they kept stalling the process until it was too late. True to expectations, we never did hear anything from the security department and we checked out of the Banyon on Tuesday morning, minus half our clothes that were too stained to wear. So sad. And such a sad impression to leave with first time guests.",Saskatchewan,"Prairie_Dusters</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saskatchewan</strong>",45,4.0

We have rented privately owned units bith times ( 1st thru owner ) & this trip a unit thru Koko resorts management company and based on the unit description made our choice. The decription was not accurate with some items on our must have list being so false as to say "" watch the surfers from your lanai"" when the balcony has been built in and is not in fact a lanai but a railing at the edge of the glass doors. The walls were damaged, wallpaper peeling, cushions on the couch were filthy/stained & smelled, the bed was so incredibly terrible and was not the queen it stated but 2 twins pushed together.

Very worn, basic '70's furnishings. However, once I got over that I was very pleased with the location and what the room had to offer. There was a full kitchen, toaster, pots, rice cooker, microwave, etc. We went to Costco and got cereal, buns, veggies, water, juice, fruit, salads etc. I also bought coffee and filters. Our room came with a coffee maker and two small tea- bag style coffees but I like a more robust cup to start the day. We bought coffee in the lobby the first morning ( two for $5.00) so the bag of coffee and filters saved me tons and kick started my day. The beach is a short stroll away. As far as locations go, this was as close or closer than most places. the zoo is a block away when you need a break from the beach. This hotel is a condo with hotel services. Daily room service , front desk, parking etc. beach towels can be borrowed ( signed out) from housekeeping and changed when ever needed. Noise was not an issue. Our room was right by the elevator but we heard nothing. This is not a fancy place, but the sheets were crisp and clean? It came with two double beds and a pull out sofa. I found the bed hard and the pull- out sofa was missing springs and not comfortable. ) the air conditioner worked well and it was easy to return to our rooms during the day and head back out again.","British Columbia, Canada","Mamesthename</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>British Columbia, Canada</strong>",25,3.0

Our unit was Aston. Décor is the same, as far as I could see. There are 2 towers, connected, with a parking garage. Maintenance is good. Pool, 2 small hot tubs and BBQ’s are on the 6th floor between the towers. Closes at 9pm.Our unit: Tower 2, 20th floor, corner unit, “Mountain View” - facing East, I think, away from the ocean. I see from my lanai (4’ x 14’) the canal and a golf course, set against mountains with residential areas on them. Very pretty at night with all the lights! Large! 14’ x 24’ living room with dining table at one end, hide-a-bed, chair, end tables done in light cane wood with nice “island” upholstery. Kitchen is narrow but usable, older, probably original cabinets and appliances but they work fine and the kitchen isn’t visible from the main area so it’s not noticeable until you’re in it. Bedroom has queen bed and full closet. Bed was a bit soft for my taste but comfy. Daily maid service, with linen change every 3rd day. They don’t touch the kitchen, though (except when you depart, they wash ALL the dishes, etc. for the next tenants). In the meantime, you clean your own kitchen.Our experience: Arrived at 3:15pm. JoLynn checked us in; very professional. When she handed me the “Amenity Fee Consent Form” (which, fortunately I had read about on my reservation print-out) it said $15 per night. My print-out said $10, and I brought this up to her. “No problem!“ she said and changed the form. “You must have booked before the new year.“ But then she became concerned - she couldn’t verify that our room was ready. We waited 15 minutes or so and she nicely asked us to wait in the coffee shop (like a small Starbucks, off the lobby). They held our bags for us at the desk. 10 minutes later JoLynn came into the coffee shop to find us. There was a problem and it might be an hour - but she refunded our “Amenity Fee” for the week. Wifey not happy, but 50 minutes later when JoLynn came to get us, with BellHop and bags in tow, he escorted us to our room and all was forgiven. Corner room on the 20th floor - awfully hard to complain about! JoLynn called 15 minutes later to verify that all was well. Kudos to her!Laundry room was across the hall; one washer and one dryer @ 6 quarters each. Apparently only about 13 units shared that laundry, so we had no problem using it.Coffee shop is excellent, and open 5am-7pm. Convenience store is great; open till 11pm.Parking garage on floors 1-4 @$12/day or $72/wk.

We had a late flight out (11:00pm), check out was at 12:00 (noon), so we checked our luggage with the hotel for the day (that was great) and spent the day just enjoying waikiki and caught a Shuttle from hotel to airport...recommend checking into airport at least 3 hours before your flight. The staff was extremely helpful with everything we required. Also, arrange for a shuttle pickup before you arrive on Oahu, so much more economical than taxi (we learnt the lesson). Also, if your going to enjoy any (Tour) adventures or activities highly reccomend going with the tour buses or pickup at hotel shuttles, not hopping a city bus...there are over hundred city buses apparently, so easy to get mixed up and finding the right bus to get back on. There are 2 for 1 deal and alot of coupons as well online or in alot of the tourist magazines. Just have to search them ut before u go or spend the first day walking around Waikiki Shopping area (along waikiki beach) alot of magazines and pamphet stands.

I had booked a deluxe 1 bedroom ocean view condo but understood some rooms were better than others. We were not disappointed! The room was on the 33rd floor of tower 1 and the view was spectacular. Also, the suite was clearly one of the newly renovated ones which was a huge plus. Robert on the front desk was excellent as was Corinna on the phone. Housekeeping was fast and good. It is only about 1 block to the beach and the onsite parking at $12 per day was reasonable. Now, for the bad: This property does not have a recycling program and it was painful to have to throw away items that could have easily been recycled with an extra bin or two in the kitchen to sort items. The $15 per day resort fee is too high for what you get. And, there was 5 days we could not use our suite because of really loud concrete cutting literally right outside our door on 3 days and all-day water shut-offs on 2 days. Typically, you would be out all day and this would not be a big deal but two members of our party were down with the flu and let me tell you it is no fun to have the flu and not have a bed to sleep in or quick access to bathroom facilities! I send an email to the Aston prior to posting this review and gave them my concerns (as well as the positives) but did not receive a response.

So here's my take.Check In was a breeze. The staff was always helpful We traveled with our 3 boys, so a total of 5 stayed in a standard 1-bdrm condo.We were on the 9th floor. We had a view of the 'canal' behind the resort, and an obstructed view of Diamond Head. But to us, the view didn't matter, since we were not spending a ton of time in the room. This (for us) was simply a place to cook some of our meals, relax after a long day and sleep.The room and 9th floor was outdated. But I know this building/individual units are privately owned, and only managed by Aston. So that being said, yes, you could end up with an updated unit, or a dated unit. Our 'outdated' unit was clean, the carpet-yes old-was clean. They put together 2 twin beds to make a king bed. Strange-well yes, but at the end of the day, I was thankful for a clean bed and cool room.The kitchen had plenty of dishes/utensils to make a meal for 5. They do not provide any type of seasonings---salt/pepper. I would suggest stopping at either a SafeWay, Foodland etc and stocking up there. There are no real grocery stores within the area.The walk to the beach was a breeze-2 blocks. We used parking for a few days, when we had a rental car. $12-yes, but much cheaper than most places around the area. It was somewhat of a pain to have to pay for each day-rather than paying up front for 3 days. **They only take cash**The pool was clean and the kids enjoyed this. We went to the activity deck a few times. My 3 year old enjoyed the play area. There's a little snack bar there too. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. The price was right for us. Staying a block closer at a more luxurious place would have costed much more....and what else would we have gotten for it? Modern decor? An actual king bed? You're in Hawaii, you should be outside enjoying the vacation. Not inside enjoying the color scheme laying on your king bed watching a large flat screen.I'd probably be inclined to stay again--if we came with the whole family.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin","Jp1up</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",34,4.0

The unit itself hadn't been renovated for awhile, but it was what it needed to be -- a clean, comfortable, spacious place to stay. Parking was $12/day, and the beach was less than two blocks away.

It is a hustle and bustle type of place where you can do lot's of shopping, hang out at a beach for some basic surfing or just see and be seen by the many tourists that flock to this place.So hotels that are right on the Beach, that are affordable you really can't go past the Aston.

Staff are friendly enough and most rooms have a nice Ocean view.Our tip, don't rent a car for the first few days, then organise for one and head one day to Hanauma bay for some of the best snorkling in the world.

To start with no gifts for our special occasion,then we found rips in our bedroom curtains,the shampooed floor well lets say very stained floor,shoe marks on the kitchen floor, a rip(hole) in the tinted screen on balconey sliding door, the double bed was on a metal base, that was bigger then the mattress and you either kicked the end or when getting up you scrapped your legs on the base and the mattresses kept sliding apart as nothing holding the mattress together and also there was no headboard on the bed. The dressingtable with large mirror was falling apart as mirror wasnt attached at back properly. There was water damage on the ceiling and you could see how poorly the paint work was in the lounge room by the switches as just painted around them. The sliding doors of the wardrobe were water damaged and paint chips on the base and the doors kept falling of the hinges. And if your a smoker dont stay on the 37th floor stay on the 6th or lower.

We paid for three units for a week each thru Interval International. This was only available as a getaway vacation not for timeshare exchange. We were pleased with our ability to get three units in one place in July. After we got there we discovered a few things that we did not know ahead of time.Let me start with the high points: The staff was very helpful even in areas in which they had no control. They were always very friendly when we spoke with them. The location is only one block from the beach which is great. It is walking distance to the zoo and several local places to eat off the normal tourist area.Unfortunately there were a few issues that really knocked this resort down. First was the statement we heard over and over again from the staff. That is controlled by the Banyan owners association and we have no control over this and this and that. This would begin with the cost of using the parking garage, paying to use golf clubs for miniature golf, and tennis rackets. Having to actually pay to use the BBQ’s, a new low among resorts we have stayed at over the years. Finally the association decided to shut the water off all day to a large section of the units which just happened to fall on the day of our in-laws 50th wedding celebration and their room. So they could not get ready and even shower we had to plead for another room to be able to move them into. The front desk worked hard and finally found us a room. Our room was very dated and showed obvious signs of damage, water, mold, etc. and had been cheaply repaired. The other two units were in much better shape so roll the dice on what you may end up with.Bottom line: Remember this is called an Aston resort but Aston does not really control this resort they only manage the rental units, the association runs the resort and they let you know every time you want to do something.

We left our bags in the room and went to grab a bit to eat at a local restaurant. When we got back to our room there were ROACHES IN OUR LUGGAGE!!! I immediately went downstairs and asked them to switch my room which they did. I was given the keys to go take a look at 4 rooms (and they gave us a smaller room type then what I paid for) that all had a friendly roach or 2 waiting for me at the door. Ben the supervisor then began to get an attitude with me and all I wanted was a nice clean room. I asked if he could send me to a sister hotel and he wouldn’t so after begging him for a cleaner room he put us up in a DIRTY full/twin room w/o a pull out bed for the night, the sheets had gum on them and the sick and tub wouldn’t drain. This was my parents first time in Hawaii and they were sharing a room with my fiancé and I. After spending my entire first day dealing with the hotel issue I went down to the lobby in the morning and Milie was able to get us into the Waikiki Aston Pacific Monarch. How was a regular staff member able to do something Ben couldn't?!?!? This was when our trip turned around. They wouldn’t refund our parking (we paid a week in advance) at the Banyan but that was a small price to pay for all the drama that went on. I would never stay there again especially because Ben the supervisor doesn’t know how to deal with customers. I wasn’t expecting a high end hotel but I was expecting clean and they were not. The furniture was mismatched and old. I didn’t want to sit on their couches because it looked like there had been quite a few crazy nights on them…NEVER AGAIN!","Sherman Oaks, California, United States","Jenny E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sherman Oaks, California, United States</strong>",6,1.0

The room had two double beds plus a fold out sofa bed and housekeeping brought up a crib. The lounge area was very spacious – a real treat in Hawaii. I didn’t take any photos of the room as it was exactly the same as all the other photos other reviewers have posted – standard Hawaiian hotel duvet covers and furnishings.The room itself was perfect for what we needed, which was a full kitchen with an area that we could close off for afternoon naps for the little one. The room was old and a little run down – but certainly no more so than other standard hotels I’ve stayed at in Waikiki, including the Sheraton Princess and the Ohana East and West hotels.The playground was great and fish pond provided good distraction for my child. The pool was very large, though not heated...yet the hot tub was really really hot.Overall, a fantastic location – close to beach and the zoo, away from the central business of Waikiki, yet close enough to walk to the hub at night.Note that later in our trip we stayed two nights at the Embassy Waikiki suites and for value for money and size of the room – I’d take the Aston Waikiki Banyan.Would definitely stay here again if I needed a good size condo in Waikiki.",Melbourne,"AussieBecs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",75,4.0

I was told thru booking on line that the remainder of the bill which was taxes will be collected upon check in. I was fine with this option. Friday May 11, 2012 arrived at 5p.m. As I stood inline to check in, couldn’t help but over hear gentlemen at counter complaining about extra charges and deposits that needed to be paid ASAP!It was my turn, as I stood there waiting for my keys to my room I was hit with a balance of $355.00! WHAT where did the $300.00 come from, was then told it’s a room deposit, I was like why wasn’t I told about this being I only brought $250.00 with me ( needed to cash check the next morning) I advised women at front desk I don’t have that money and was unaware of this extra charge. She said unfortunately they don’t tell you unless you ask at the time of booking.So now I’m having a disagreement with front desk , who then brings supervisor into the conversation. He tells me that I need to pay the money or go else where. He says he can refund me my original room fees. so I am upset at the fact that I was 2 hrs. into this argument, my kids are fussing and I’m in lost of words because not only I’m unable to find a hotel at this last minute notice , it will take up to 2 weeks for my refund to be received. so I ask for them to at least help me find another hotel to stay as a favor for putting me out the answer I got was “ we can’t do that for you!” UGH!as my boyfriend continued with the argument about inconveniencing us by the way its cussing already because we are so fed up! ( taking off of work, planning for months in advanced etc..) by this time I’m in tears so the supervisor say we can take half the deposit and let you stay for one night that’s the best they can do upon receiving the other half of deposit the next day after cashing our check. My plans for the night was shot, we missed our dinner reservations and the rest of our plans we had for Friday evening! not only that but I got locked out the room for goodness sake, as I went to the front desk to fix the problem I witnessed more complaints being dealt with at the counter of people checking in. I returned the next morning with the other half of the deposit. and was booked for the second night and was told that upon check out $300.00 would be returned to me .(sat night) was locked out again! when asked about this problem its their standard policy to do this to force customer to come down and make sure payment is received and that’s why keys are programmed to lock you after 24 hrs..just in case some tries to skip on the bill. Sunday check out – after waiting for receipts to be printed , upon signing out saw that most of the money was being given back when asked where my full amount of money was , answer I got was “I’m not sure “after several attempts of adding and subtracting I was then told that taxes were being subtracted, now is this the same taxes that you were suppose to take out at the time of check in.” umm yes, mam”WHAT THE HECK! yes, they did not take taxes out they decided to take taxes after check resulting in not getting my total deposit back. after this really bad ordeal, I asked for superior to call me back as I felt I needed to make a complaint and be somewhat compensated for bad service. I was told that hotel did their job according to policy.and that they were sorry for me having a bad experience. no compensation will be made or thought of, do you have any other questions, if not thank you and goodbye reason for bad experience and having done what they did was” because of previous guest spoiling it for the rest of you , we handled it this way”","Waianae, Hawaii","Rylia13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waianae, Hawaii</strong>",16,1.0

It's a central position, close to everything you need in Waikiki. My one and only complaint is the bedding. I understand that some units are privately owned, however when you lay your head down at the end of a long day, a little comfort would be nice. The mattresses were springy and lumpy. My 16 y.o. son (who could sleep anywhere) was unable to bunker down on the divan.

We booked through KoKo resorts (a property management company) that manages a large number of privately owned suites. This review in reference to service and the quality of the condos we rented through Koko resorts. I can't speak for the quality of the suites run by the hotel. This was a family trip with three children, ages 2,11, and 14. I can't say enough good things about having booked through KoKo resorts. Staff was friendly and efficient, and accommodating right from booking through the holiday. One of the reasons I would definitely recommend booking though them if you want to stay at the Banyan is that they have an office on the 5th floor FULL of anything you could need for your holiday. You can borrow at anytime, for no cost and it is super casual. We saved hundreds of dollars by doing this. We borrowed surf boards, boogie boards, two beach umbrellas, a stroller, sand toys, chairs for the beach, snorkeling equipment,and tennis rackets! We stayed in two suites for the time we were there. We booked late and could not get one unit for the whole time. First 6 nights were in a suite on the 11th floor. Comfortable and clean. Older and not remodeled but no issues. You can take your towels to Koko resorts anytime and they will exchange for clean ones. There is no daily maid service. I have noted that often people complain about the rooms, or the hotel being older etc. The thing is if you want 5 star or luxury then you have to pay for it. This is not 5 star or luxury however it is clean and very good for the price. 90$ per night for a full condo with kitchen and a separate bedroom is very good value. koko resorts also provides blow up twin good quality air mattresses and playpen if you need. Again free of charge when many hotels charge extra . The last 8 nights we stayed in suite 2801 (highly recommend) It is fully remodeled, a corner unit, beautiful kitchen and it was only 120$ per night. The hotel is a short walk to the beach. It is a good location. Pool is nice and fairly warm with two hotutbs.My two year old had no trouble going right in. We made use of the barbecue (cost =1$ for an hour.We never paid as we shared with others) Never too busy at pool or barbecue. There are tennis courts and kids play area. Is it older? Yes. Could it use some renos? Yes, but it is clean and provides all the amentities. The only negative I will say is that the v desk staff was not ery helpful when they find out that you are not staying with the hotel and are renting a private suite. For example my son asked for change to use the laundry machine(another bonus, one on each floor) he was told they wounldn't give him the dollar because he wasn't with them. Also one night we ended down to the front area to get a cab to go to a restaurant. We then remembered that we thought it was closed. Having no cell phone we asked to use the phone and they were really rude. I asked also another time to borrow a phone book and they said no. So I am not sure if there is some sort of animosity between the two or not. So my advise...don't ask them for anything! Parking is free. At least it is when you book through Koko. Definitely a a bonus. Recommend the Zoo. Out two favorite places to eat. Lulu's and Irifune's. We rented a car for 4 days. We went to the ko'olina lagoons excellent place to swim with little ones. We went to Turtle bay resort to snorkle. Also good. Saw the turtles on the North shore and lastly went to Lanikea beach (so beautiful).

Everything is an easy walk in Waikiki, so unless paying premium rates to be right on the beach is important to you, there is a lot to like about staying at the Banyan. Three minute walk to the beach, five minutes tops to the Aquarium, Zoo, Waikiki Shell or Kapi'olani Park.You get a little extra space with separate sleeping areas, a living room and full kitchen. The unit I had had a great view from the lanai. The living room had an HD tv with built in DVD player. The kitchen can save you a lot of money and time by allowing breakfast or lunch in instead of overpriced restaurants. The facility has free parking, which is unusual in Waikiki where many hotels charge $20-$30 a day. If you have a car and are driving, the location allows for easy routes out of Waikiki. There is also an activity deck on the sixth floor with tennis courts, large grills, a pool and two small hot tubs. It's not a luxury facility but it's not designed to be. It does what it is supposed to do and it does it well. The price is comparable to some of the very average two star hotels that dot inland Waikiki along Kuhio and the Ali Wai Canal, but you get much, much more for the money. I would recommend the Banyan for corporate travels, families, or travelers on a moderate budget.","Marina del Rey, California","Fitch7600</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marina del Rey, California</strong>",52,4.0

We wanted to stay in a place that had a seperate bedroom with a hide-a-bed and found the Aston Banyan. We stayed here at the end of Feb 2012 on the 37th floor of Tower 1 - It was very nice! Enjoyed the great views and the room was updated. Tower 2 looks straight out the the ocean (on the 1 side). Tower 1 faces more directly to Diamond head, but still can get an ocean view to the side. The regular beds were comfortable, the room was clean and cozy. The door separating the Living area is 3 sliding doors, 1 of ours did not shut, but that was ok, it was open most of the time anyway and the A/C was in the living room area so you would want the door open to get some cool air. The kitchen was nice to be able to keep some things in the fridge for breakfast & lunch. The microwave and coffee maker in the room were also nice to keep costs down. The elevators were very nice and speedy. The pool was warm and there were a choice of 2 hot tubs. We enjoyed the pool area. There is a movie rental kiosk available for guests which is included in the ammenity fee - this came in handy on the rainy evening we had there. This is a condo/Hotel with regular owners as well as vacationers. The staff was very nice and helpful. We watched it on a flat screen TV in the living room. I would definately recomend this Hotel and stay here again. GETTING AROUND - It was a short walk to the Beach and walking distance to Int'l market square (great for souvenier shopping and they definately bargain here and really try hard to sell you items) and the Food Pantry (grocery store) which has cheaper food items than the ABC stores on each corner. We scheduled a taxi (van) online (a8taxi) to pick us up from the airport for $30 which worked out very well - he was waiting for us when we landed and drove us straight to our Hotel. We also took the City bus for $2.50 to Diamond head. The ride back from Diamond head took a bit of a wait for the bus, but we used our transfer pass from our first ride, and it was free on the way back. There is a bit of a walk to the main entrance of Diamond Head where the bus drops you off at the bottom entrance to Diamond Head, but it wasn't too bad - it was about a 20 min walk. We scheduled a tour bus through the Hotel for the Circle Island Tour. I would definately recommend a circle island tour thru one of the tour companies, it is a good way to view the island. There are frequent stops at the overlooks and we also got a history of the island from our driver koko.The boogie boards are fun for the kids and you can find them at abc stores & others along the beach. We got one for $15 that my daughter used while we were there and then just passed it along to another family when we left. My daughter also had surf lessons on the beach from HOW (can't remember full name, but HOW is on all of their surf boards and they are located right on the beach across from Kealohilani Ave I think - or maybe a bit further North, but they were set up right on the beach with umbrella & chair rentals also. Anyway it was $60 for an hour and the instructor was very good and she go up right away. The water was shallow enough so I could walk out a ways toward where she was and get some good photos and then she also surfed right past me. She also could use the surf board after her lesson until she got tired out.COUPONS - There are Oahu Gold books all along the sidewalks which have some good coupons for activities, shuttles, taxi & food. We found a coupon in there for Limo service back to the airport for $31 which was quite fun. If you are on a budget for dining, there is a Denny's and an Ihop about 10 min walk from the Hotel. Int'l Market square is right next to Denny's. We felt safe walking aroung in day or evening - there are usually alot of people out walking along the main areas.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","VacationFun3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",2,4.0

My reviews generally focus on perceived interests by our seniors, still active in their Golden Years and - my feedbacks bear this out - on getting value. Accommodation in Hawaii is expensive, and so is food. Travelers head for Don Quijote, Sam's, Costco, Foodland at Ala Moana Center and Food Pantry for supplies; restaurants for every taste and purse abound. The ""strip"", Kalakaua Ave. hugs the beaches and sees thousands of visitors and residents promenade all day shopping, eating, tanning, surfing.Forget about parking, instead obtain a card for ""The BUS""; take the B Express to its terminus ($2.50 reg., seniors $1.00, exact fair), bring picture ID, get scanned and presto for $10.00 you get a 4-year card onto which you attach a strip for one calendar-month at $5.00; it's another $5 next time you visit. Board any ""The BUS"" anywhere, anytime, on-off as you please.Exploring Oahu island, 2 bus-loops offer themselves, at no further charge, one to sightsee the Eastern and Northern part incl. Waikiki, about 4 hrs., and the centre and Western Honolulu, about 3 hrs. There are plenty of sights to visit - let your wallet decide! And, when finally you must bid adieu, ""The BUS"" takes you to the airport with your card.

One night the bbq we were using did not work, we were not reimbursed but rather told we probably had too much on the grill (2 steaks). 8 nights in, we realized our condo had bedbugs!We were moved to another condo for the remainder of our stay, only to have a suitcase stolen out of the laundry room with just a few hours unattended (it had clothes out of the condo with bedbugs that needed to be laundered, and the suitcase needed to be sprayed before I would take it into the new condo).We lost count of the number of people on the elevator that we noticed had bed bug bites after we knew what they looked like!

The bathroom was a little small, but functional, and the water in the shower was always hot.There was a full kitchen with oven and cooktop, a full fridge, microwave, and a double sink. There is also a full dinner set for 4 with plates, bowels, coffee cups, glasses and wine glasses. There was also pots and pans and bbq utensils to use at the pool deck.The hotel has a pool deck with BBQ facilities and a pool and hot tub. I found it was always clean and tidy and there were plenty of deck chairs.The coffee shop and mini mart were handy too. The coffee shop has internet access and we had breakfast there each morning (coffee and bagels). The staff in the coffee shop were lovely and always greeted you with a smile.The hotel is one block from the beach, so it was not far to walk anywhere, two mins and you are in the main shopping district. The bus also stops on Kuhio Ave just at the front of the hotel to take you all over the island.Overall this is a lovely hotel. It is clean and quiet, and the staff are friendly.

I booked two rooms which by shear coincidence were not next together but still worked out great. Having the full kitchens allowed us to make breakfast each morning and lunch for when the kids tired out mid day. My room had the breakfast bar set up while my dads the rounded table. While we all would have been comfortable in the one room, having two gave my teenaged brother a bit of space and somewhere for the kids to go when they tired of mommy. My room had a good overlook of the recreation deck and a bit of the ocean. Overall we loved it for the location, amenities, and value.

Booked this hotel as it was very convenient to a kid friendly beach, and the price was right. We stayed in a suite on the 9th floor. The property shows a little age, but we didn't expect the Ritz for these prices. We were very comfortable and the room was clean. The front desk was easy to communicate with and cheerfully met our requests. The Concierge was of no help, the woman I spoke with was not very knowledgable of anything. We were happy with the pool, play & BBQ area, though we spent most of our time on the beach, which was safe and clean. Best tip I can say is, if you want fresh fruits, go to the Saturday Market near the College, it is GREAT! There is also a small one where you can get local fruits and veggies in a parking lot about 100' to your right as you walk out of the hotel on Tuesdays.

It was clean, stocked with towels and toilet paper and the like, and had a beautiful view (facing north i believe... we could see diamond head if we looked to the right). The combination of the location and the affordability of the property was ideal. The property is one small block away from the beach and also one small block (in a different direction) from the local bus stop which we used daily ($25 for a four day unlimited bus pass easily took us to pearl harbor, dole plantation, north shore beaches, manoa falls, etc albeit rather slowly). The kitchen did not have any pots and we didn't know what to do with leftover cooking oil etc which we would have had to buy so we didn't do any real cooking. However, the microwave was handy for microwave dinners and the fridge was handy to keep cold drinks and fruit and to store restaurant leftovers which we reheated in the microwave. The expedia local concierge in the lobby of the property was also helpful and convenient to obtain maps and brochures and also to book excursions (yet booking online or with someone else may be cheaper). There is an activity deck with a pool and tennis courts but we didn't have time to make use of them. I'm surprised there were people using the pool at all since the beach is so close. Overall, it was a great stay and i would recommend it for anyone, however, the spaciousness and amenities would be especially suitable for groups of friends and for families.","Toronto, Canada","iWantT0goT0there</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",3,3.0

The staff polite,friendly and helpful.The coffee shop has the best cream puffs which my husband is still pining over. Friendly staff in there as well.Our only problem was with the furnishings on the 14th floor condo having a very,very large worn hole in the fabric of the only chair in the suite. We did not think this reflected the Aston's standards and were surprised that they would let an owner continue to not address the situation. It should not require a wait for a total overhaul of the unit to repair fabric on one chair. Otherwise the room was made up promptly each day and it was nice to have the bedroom/kitchen/livingroom setup. The decor is a bit dated but I'm not interested in paying inflated hotel prices for stainless steel fridge, stove and granite countertops. We liked the location since it is a little quieter then most locations in Waikiki but still within easy walking distance of the beach.

If you have a family of 4 or less, with small children, then this is probably one of the best places to stay in Waikiki for the price, location and full kitchen. The rooms are 1 bedroom with a sofabed.The day we have arrived we checked into our standard room (booked with a package deal). Unfortunately, the room we got faced the pool. Literally, once you opened the curtains, people could look directly into your room. It was that close. Suffice it to say, I was not happy. Ok, yes, I paid for a standard room, but I didn't expect no privacy. So it was either keep the room and stay in the dark all 10 days or go see if we could switch rooms.Well, just our luck that the entire hotel was fully booked! So after spending almost an hour with the front desk to see what they could do, one of the mgrs said they could release one of the mountain view rooms the next day for us ( I was willing to pay for the upgrade at this point). So the next day, I asked if I could see the room they were going to give us, but to my surprise, they offered me a corner ocean/mountain view room for a small upgrade charge! The new room was fantastic and the kids loved it. For me, that's what I called great service. I just wanted a room with some privacy and ended up getting a great view (even though I paid a little more for it). Thank you to hotel management.Positives:- Terrific customer service (from front desk to housekeeping to bellhops)- 1 block away from beach- Full kitchen, fridge, microwave, stove, etc...- Laundry machines on each floor- Parking cheap! $10/dayNegatives:- Hotel and rooms are a bit worn down (guess it depends on which condo you get and what floor it's on).- Carpet felt weird and not that clean (keep slippers on).- Sofabed was barely sleepable. Good thing the kids aren't that heavy. Could feel the springs. (These sofabeds need to be inspected and replaced, even from our last stay.)- Elevators in Tower 1 were slow, but probably due to a full capacity.- small bathroom (really 1 person in there at a time, but sink was outside so that helped).- small pool and crowded all the time- kid's play structure (closed entire time we were there)So in summary, even though I listed the negatives, I would still choose to stay at this condo hotel based on the amenities and location even though the hotel is a bit worn.

These are not hotel rooms you are getting - they are small apartments. They have a separate bedroom (with a sliding door) - full bath and a full kitchen, flu stove, full fridge, some even have dishwashers. There is also BBQ's that you can ""rent"" by the hour down on the pool deck - cheap and work great.Some people may be saying that - Hey I don't want to cook and clean while on vacation - I get that, but when you are in Honolulu for a couple of weeks at a time - you get pretty sick of eating out all the time. We usually do B'fast and lunch at home, and then go our for a nice dinner in the evening - you will be amazed at how the savings grow - just head to the Safeway ( a short cab ride from the hotel) and stock up on some groceries.The location of this hotel - is the best. You are a short block from the beach, the Zoo is a bit further - and all other attractions in the Waikiki area is a short 10 - 15 min walk at most. The area as with most areas of Waikiki is very safe - I have never felt unsafe in the area. The neighbourhood is quiet - not a lot of traffic or other noise. This property is a hotel/condo building - so you do have some folks that live there year round.The pool is a salt water pool - and there are 2 hot tubs (difference temperatures) - a putting course as well.You could not ask for better hotel staff- they are always friendly and smiling - and they remember you form trip to trip - since we have stayed there so many times - there is always a nice bottle of wine, chocolates and a welcome back card (hand written) waiting for us in our room.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone that is visiting Honolulu - especially if you have kids (which we don't) - but the value for your money is just not found anywhere else.Enjoy your trip and ALOHA!","Toronto, Canada","toflyguy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",16,5.0

It was perfect for what we needed. The outside lobby is welcoming and the kids loved the Koi pond and waterfall. The Aston staff were all very helpful. Elevators were modern and pretty speedy. With four of them we never had a long wait to get to and from our room on the 15th floor. The rooms are a bit dated but, knowing that these are priviately owned condos managed by Aston, it's understandable that Aston can't simply update the condos on their own. They need the owners to provide the update. The condo had everything we needed. The large king bed was great but, the pullout sleeper needed a new mattress bad. It was not very comfortable. Full maid service is limited to every three days although we did get limited service daily (towels, TP, soap, etc.). No big deal. Aston also provides large towels for swimming which you can turn in as often as you need for fresh dry towels. Going out onto the lanai every evening with a book or glass of wine was nice. A/C in the room helped to keep it comfortable. The 1 block walk to the beach was also no problem for us. We used the kitchen a few times and had no issues; it was nice to have the option. Parking is convenient although we had a full size car and the spots are tight. Expect to pay for parking. For a family vacation we'd do it again with no hesitation. If you're looking for a more intimate couples trip, I'd go with something like the Royal Hawaiian or Hilton - something on the beach.

But it was relatively clean. We brought our 11 month old crawling baby who has the most sensitive skin to dust mites and he didn't get a single bite from the carpet in the week we stayed here.Our late check-in was smooth for the most part but the crib was missing when we arrived even though the lady at the front desk confirmed it was already in there when I asked at check in. It was promptly brought up. Not the nicest crib in the world but functional (white metal crib, a little creaky).I wouldn't call our one bedroom a ""one bedroom"" either. it's more a Junior One bedroom with banquet style hall dividers closing the bedroom from the living room.The location is wonderful, especially for those who are on a ""foodcation"" like we were. Tons of local spots to hit up nearby (diamond head - KCC farmers market, waiola shaved ice, leonards malasadas, ono hawaiian food, ono seafood, fresh catch for poke, iyasume masube, koa, etc) but also with the conveniences of a touristy neighborhood (ie. waikiki beach, shopping, ABC stores every block).The parking is so convenient. I heard other places make you valet which will end up costing you more money via tips. $60 for the week was great with in & out privileges.Pool was nice but breezy. there is a snack stand there serving up smoothies and hawaiian fare. I wish I had time to try the food there but I didn't.Our room 3306 was right in front of the elevator but not noisy at all. There is a laundry room on each floor with one washer and one dryer, $1.50 for each load. Convenient if you are travelling with kids and don't want to pack too much. Definitely do the load in the morning as the afternoon seems to be a popular time to do laundry.Beds - they were fine. definitely not luxurious, don't expect a pillowtop. no bed skirt or headboard either but this ain't the W hotel.Beach is so close - 3 min walk. Go right to see all the surfers or go left for more quiet areas.Night time - very vibrant with tons of buskers doing shows. lots of fun!This place sufficed quite nicely for the price.

This was our 3rd stay at the Banyan and every time we are happy with our stay. I like the fact of cooking a majority of our meals so we can cook healthfully- not to mention we get tired of eating out. When we travel with our children, we can put them to bed in the bedroom and stay up , have a drink/watch a movie etc. So much better than staying in a regular hotel room!! Love having our own lanaii !!Great location close to the beach as well as the away from the busy streets of Waikiki. Have always felt somewhat safe in the area. The coffee bar on the main floor is cute, has great coffee and treats. Friendly, over the top staff- always willing to help. We tried the bbq's (coin operated) and they took forever to cook on and heat up. Will not use them again really. Play structure is superb for our small aged children as well as the pool and hot tub/deck area are well maintained and nice.

We are a family of four with two teenagers. We paid an average (including taxes) of $204 per night via Expedia for what seemed to be a standard “condo-style” room. The property is a hotel, but it appears to have some rooms that operate as hotel rooms and others that are privately owned (including some that are rented separately as condo rentals). We stayed here in 2008 and rented directly from a condo owner that time.The hotel is fairly conveniently located, about two blocks from the beach. It is possible to get closer to the beach and there are many hotels right on the water. But you’ll pay a significant premium to do so. Our room was somewhat older in décor and furnishings, but it was fine. It had a small number of minor annoyances. The electrical outlet in the bathroom sparked when we first tried to use it and it never worked properly after that. The “pocket” bathroom door did not close properly (so that it could be locked) because the door did not align perfectly with the door frame casing. One of the “shelf rails” on the door of the fridge kept falling off its mounting bracket.Our room had a full kitchen, as well as a bedroom that was separated from the main living area by a three-part sliding door. However, the bathroom was on the bedroom side of the divider (i.e., essentially making it an en suite), which could be inconvenient for some. We had an ocean view, although the view was really only “partial” due to the numerous other tall buildings between us and the water.We used the 6th floor pool and barbecue area a few times. The pool area tends to be a little windy. The barbecues are quite convenient for grilling dinner, although they are coin operated (electrical) and there were a few times when other guests put their coins in the slots but the BBQs did not work.I have few complaints about the hotel. It is not a new property and the rooms have not been updated. But they were functional and the price was competitive given our need for two separate sleeping areas. The hotel provides “free” wired internet access. It would have been convenient to have wireless access, because a single wired line was insufficient for the numerous laptops, netbooks and iTouch/Phone devices we had. We ended up buying a week of access on a wireless service offered by a nearby provider that was within range. However, the signal varied, which sometimes limited access.One pet peeve was the curtains/drapes. They were very thin and did little to keep out the light in the morning. As a result, we regularly woke up around 7:00 in the morning, which is not my idea of a good time when I’m on vacation. The windows were large and there was little extra bedding available to try to rig up any sort of additional window covering.We had a different parking experience than one recent poster. The $10 charge for parking is correct, and seems like a deal compared to what I pay to park downtown at home. However, we seemed to get a deal with the way the charges worked out. We parked (and paid) on evening #1. When we arrived back at the hotel on evening #2, the 24 hour period was not yet up, so we were not charged at that time. When we departed on the morning of day #3, I expected to be charged the $10 on departure. However, the parking attendant just waved us through. We ended up having a car for a hair over 72 hours and only paid $20 for parking three nights.We found the front desk staff very helpful. Our check-in was very quick and they were very helpful storing our bags and providing shower access on our departure day (our return flight departed in the evening). Housekeeping staff seemed efficient, although they always came by quite late in the afternoon, rather than in mid-morning, which seems to be the norm just about every other place I’ve been.I would stay at the Waikiki Banyan again. I would probably look for something a little more modern or right on the beach, but I wouldn’t pay a significant premium to do so and if I didn’t find anything in a reasonable range, I would go back to the Banyan.","Vancouver, B.C.","AdvisorKing</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, B.C.</strong>",139,3.0

Each suite was different, all were old and beat up. My first impression was 'oh gross' when I walked into the room. The rates were good over Christmas and the location is excellent, within walking distance to shops, restaurants and the beach. We did get used to our room and it was fine. We had no baseboards, the walls were damaged, all the furniture was marked up and old, the rug felt sticky all the time and the bathroom needed some serious work. All three suites were the same. But the location outweighed all that. If you rent a car, be prepared for the 'outsourced' parking company that is very sticky about even 5 minutes and will overcharge you at every opportunity. They are not the friendliest parking attendents either. Parking is $10 for 24 hours, and they mean 24 hours and not a minute more or they will charge you for another day. And if it happens that you are coming to pay for parking 5 minutes late, they will charge you an extra $10. For example, you pay at 12:00 the first day and on the second day you are leaving the parking lot at 12:05, they will charge you $10 for that 5 minutes. So when you come back in, say an hour later, you will have to pay $10 again for the next 24 hours. They are very nasty about it. Other than that, we had no problems. Like I said, if you can overlook the 'oldness' of the place, it is in an excellent location and our chambermaid was very good. We could get wi-fi in one of the rooms but not the others, and all had wired internet. One of the suites had 2 tv's and the others only had one. There are washer and dryers, $1.50 for each load and the dryer runs an hour which is awesome. We also left four boogie boards in the parking garage for someone else to use because they were given to us by people not wanting to take them home as well.

Upon our arrival, chocolate covered macadia nuts and a small bottle of Korbel Brut champagne awaited us in our room - along w/a gorgeous deluxe oceanfront view (same as depicted on website) from the 34th floor. Granted the room needs updating - but it was clean (with the exception of the outside of the fridge door), comfortable, and practical. The layout of the room and lanai allowed for gorgeous ocean views. The bed was the most comfortable we've ever experienced. My husband suffers from spinal irregularities and struggles for a good night's rest. He said he's never slept more comfortably - no back aches! The air conditioner worked marvelously and was extremely quiet. Fridge worked great. Stocked kitchen w/basic housewares made saving $$ on food preparation easy. Staff was pleasant and VERY accomodating - especially with our late check-out, which we were allowed the last day free of charge. Having an extra 2 hours afforded us extra time on the beach before our frigid flight back to the midwest. My husband and I plan to return to the Hawai'ian Islands for another vacation and will definately consider staying at the Banyan again. We also plan to recommend the Banyan to all our traveling family and friends!!","South Milwaukee, Wisconsin","lgokey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>South Milwaukee, Wisconsin</strong>",3,5.0

No Wifi in building or room. You can only find poor signal out side the cafe, you can get access only when you buy drink there.The worst is the parking. Not only they charge $10 a day (expensive than some hotels around which charge $8), the rule is also tricky. You may get charged for $30 for less than 48 hours even though they claim $10 can cover 24 hours.Their rules are ridiculous. You get in, they charge you $10 and put a sticker with expiration time (24 hours exactly). You can come out one minutes over that time, they will ask for another $10 but without any extension of your time! If you get back after sometime, another $10. If you drive in say, 9:00am on Monday, leave 10:00am on Tuesday and bcak in the night at 8:00pm on Tuesday and check out on 8:00am Wed, you will be charged for $30 for just 47 hours.

Most folks call this condo 'The Wakiki Banyan' and it's located just a block away from the heart of Waikiki - the beach, shops, great restaurants abound this neighborhood. And the bus stops one block away. In the event that you rent a car, the building does have a parking lot. Our apt included a car space (at no additional cost). The area was safe for a busy city with a lot of people. One of the condo's managers, JD, was excellent at organizing our stay. The photos on Interval International are outdated so it was a pleasant surprise that the building and neighborhood were really quite nice. We had an apt on the 27th floor and the view of the mountains were beautiful. The apt furniture was outdated though. All was very clean and the flat screen tv in the living room was nice (plus a tv in the bedroom). The living room has an extra bed (murphy bed) although we didn't use it. The regular king size bed in the bedroom was excellent and very comfortable. The AC worked well and the apt had a patio. Each apt floor has washers/dryers which is convenient if you need it (buy laundry detergent.) The kitchen had a large refrigerator, microwave, appliances, dishwasher, toaster, dishes, no stove though. Also had a kitchen table that seats (4). We ate out daily so we didn't use the kitchen much. The apt had a good setup and was very comfortable. We were on a high floor, we thought it was pretty quiet for a really busy area like Waikiki Beach. Every so often you would hear a EMS siren, etc., but it was very quiet overall. Every night we slept with the balcony door and apt windows wide open and we slept soundly. The neighbors were also very quiet.October in Oahu was awesome. It was hot enough for the beach (83-85 degrees by day - which was pretty hot) and around 80 at night. Waikiki Beach and the main strip is a 2 minute walk from the apt. The beach was fun and full of people and the shopping strip was great. A lot of great stores (Coach, Tiffany, etc) along with great hotels to pop into and have dinner or enjoy a drink (Westin). The Ala Moana mall was awesome. We rented a car for a couple of days (which you really need if you plan to go to other beaches and the north side of the island) and we used the bus for the rest of our stay. We took the bus and easily reached a lot of locations (ie. Pearl Harbor, Iolani Palace (highly recommend), etc. We were planning to go to a lot of places so we purchased the Oahu 'Go Card' which worked out really, really well for us. We purchased the 7-day card (you can buy a 3 or 5 or 7 day card) and for an all inclusive price and per card received: Grand Circle Island Tour (all day tour), entry and audio tour to USS Arizona, USS Bowfin, and Battleship Missouri Memorial, transportation to Diamond Head Crater, transportation and equipment for Hanauma Bay Snorkeling, 1 day Car Rental (per card), admission to Iolani Palace, admission to Queen Emma Summer Palace, Catamaran sail, daily Surf lessons, Daily beach chair rental, 4 hour Moped rental. If you don't plan to do a lot then the Go To Card is probably not worth it, but for us, it saved a lot of $ rather than pay for each individual item.Nice hotels to hang out and have dinner, drinks in the immediate area included the Westin and the Hyatt (Hyatt has some really nice shops too). There were so many good restaurants to choose from as well.For groceries, chocolates, sun lotion, beach towels, etc., rather than shop in the condo's mini market (on the lobby level) go to the ABC stores (All Blocks Covered). Literally, there is an ABC store on every block. You can get some groceries there and an inexpensive beach chair or roll up mat for the beach (we were surprised but the condo does not provide beach towels or beach chairs). On either Friday or Saturday nights, Waikiki Beach has a free Hula Show and it was great. The front desk can give you a map of the area and provide good tips as to some of the freebies going on.The Waikiki Banyan is in the heart of Waikiki Beach in Oahu and we will definitely return.",New York,"Carol R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",136,4.0

Checking in and out was easy.The only thing that was not so great was our first room which was tower 1 room 1012. When we first got into our room it smelled terrible!!! It smelled absolutely awful!! We talked to the front desk about moving us into a different room as we couldn't bare to sleep in the room with the funky smell. It turned out they were all booked up and wouldn't be able to move us for several days. I dealt with Jo-Lyn in reception and she was really good about situation. She had house keeping clean and freshen up our room until we were able to move to another room. The smell was still there but at least she tried to do something to make us feel comfortable until we moved rooms. We slept with the windows open to air out the room but it was hard to sleep with all the noise from outside. So our first week we didn't get too much sleep :(. We finally moved to tower 1 room 706 which was much better! Thanks Jo-Lyn for everything!The pool area/recreation area was good. There is a tennis court, bbq area, snack store, putting green, pool, hot tubs and sauna.All in all our stay was great!

This property is managed by Koko Resorts.PROS:- Excellent location - very close to the beach, shops, restaurants, tour pick-ups, zoo, aquarium. - Lovely ocean view - Tower 1 blocks the middle of the view, but lots of shoreline still visible - Good amenities - pool, hot tub, playground, snack bar, cafe, use of a playpen for toddler- Spacious kitchenCONS:- NOT CLEAN ENOUGH. Spots on all the faucets, dirty cups and pans in the cupboards, generally dusty. Worst of all, on arrival I found a large toenail clipping on the floor (gag!) and an INCH-LONG piece of GLASS on the floor! Good thing I found that before my 2-year old did. NOT IMPRESSED.- In addition to the visible dirt, the condo needs a serious deep clean or replacement of the upholstery, curtains, rug, etc. My husband and I both suffered from allergic reactions each time we spent any length of time in the condo - itchy watery eyes, congestion, sneezing. There is obviously a huge buildup of dust and possibly mold in this unit, because we rarely have allergic reactions like that in hotels, other homes, and certainly never in our own home.- Hot, stuffy elevator- Lots of urban noise on the balcony even at 29th floor- The bathroom is in the bedroom. We risked interrupting our child's sleep at nap time or in the evening when he went to bed before us. Not a huge deal in our case, but something to consider if your child is a light sleeper and not apparent from the advertisement.

Good size room and the sofa bed was very comfy. Housekeeping staff are very good as every inch of the room is cleaned daily, plenty of towel and amenity replacements.

We were in 2-3408 and it was as previously discribed by others as being dated but very clean. The appliances were likely the originals when it was built in the late 70's (?) but considering that the fridge is the only appliance that gets used daily it would be foolish to throw away perfectly functional stoves just because they are old. The same with the kitchen cabinets however it would be nice to have handles on the cabinet doors. The cabinets were stocked with dishes and cutlery for 6 people along with typical kitchen pots, toaster, gadgets and knives. There was no can punch type bottle opener. We had a breakfast bar with no kitchen table or chairs which would be very poor for people with really young children. The floor in the kitchen area was fairly new ceramic tiles however the carpeting definately should be replaced soon. Walls were clean but could use a new paint and new artwork which is faded however this did not affect our stay in the room at all. The bathroom was tiny but the sink was outside of the toilet and tub area, which was a good idea. The three sliding doors that can be used to separate the large bedroom from the living room worked very well, but anyone using the sofabed must come through the bedroom to use the bathroom, which may be a bit of an inconvenience for others, but wasn't a problem for us. The beds were not pillow top but were more comfortable then they looked. The sofabed was more suited to a child. Pillows were medium density and there were two for each bed. We did notice that the sheets were replaced every two days and when the rooms are cleaned after check out we saw them actually taking clean bedspreads into the rooms to replace the soiled ones This made us very happy as you always wonder what happened on the bedspread in the past. especially if you have an infant or children crawling on them..Our check in was fairly quick and because I had contacted the hotel weeks in advance of our arrival to request a late check out it was on file for our room. Apparently it was not a late check out but a front desk extension and there was a cost of $90.00 plus taxes so that we could keep one room, as our departure time was 10:55 pm. I am going to suggest to the booking company that they should pre-arrange this for all their late flights as a convenience which would make it better. Typically late check outs are only assigned the day of check out and only if there are rooms available. As it turned out the hotel was full and no late check outs were available on our departure day. Had we not made this request in advance, we would have been gypsies for 8 hours, even though they offered to hold our luggage.The pool is fairly shallow with the deepest point being under 6 feet and both ends of the pool being 3 feet. It is a very busy pool especially on weekends when the local residents in the two towers have guests over for BBQ's. As for the BBQ's they are electric and do not heat up very hot. Fine for meats that cook at lower temperatures (chicken, and pork) but we could not sear our steaks, they cooked but it took a long time. Some guests from Australia also commented to me about the low temperatures. Cost is only $2.00 for one hour and it is a coin operated system. They are cleaned every day. The basketball/tennis court was not used very much and the putting green was the same. It may have been a better investment to install a deeper pool for adults and a spash pool for younger children so the little ones would be able to enjoy the pool more. Great play equipment for younger children. Sam's Kitchen which is located on the 6th floor has very tasty food and also sells items for BBQ,We did not use the front desk concierge but she was very very friendly always giving a big Aloha as we went by the desk. Parking is wonderful, easy to use and only $10.00 for 24 hours. TIP check out on line for Hawaiian Discount for car rentals. We were able to save about $70.00/day by prebooking our van in advance of our travel (and we didn't have to give a credit card number either). The beach is just a block away and it has a sea wall to prevent waves from hitting young children. It is very shallow (about 3.5 feet at the deepst point near the sea wall) but perfect for younger kids or timid swimmers with a sandy bottom little or no coral.. There is NO wave action here. If you want some waves to bounce in, then you have to walk further down the beach toward the police detachment.There are a number of homeless people on the beach and in the general area so you may be approached but in a gentle manner, we were never hassled. It is a long walk to the International Market and Dukes Lane. We found if there were more than four people, it was cheaper to get a cab than to take the bus down to the other end of Waikiki. The Bus is $2.25 per adult and $1.25 for children under 12. each way.We also walked the 1.2 miles to Safeway on Kapahulu and the cab ride was only $6.60 back. Go in the morning when it is cooler as it was very hot when we were there. Leonards (Malasadas) is a bit further to walk. It was great to have breakfast and lunches in the room with fresh fruit.The lobby is very pretty with the water fall. Banyan Coffe Shop - We did use the internet service to pre-check in for our flight home. $2.50 for 8 minutes and 40 cents per page. there are other prices for longer use of their computer or bring your own. The coffee smelled terrific and the staff was very friendly.Laundry Services - There is only one washer and one dryer on each floor so if you have more than one load (like at the end of your vacation) you may have to use machines on more than one floor - we did.Our room attendant was fabulous. We were travelling with our daughter and her family and we occasionally kept the baby over night or during the day. We always got extra towels and even an extra blanket to put on the floor for the baby, when the crib was in our room. We really appreciated her kindness in providing the little extras for us.The hotel provided shampoo/conditioner which was terrific and bath and face soap. No lotion or other amenities like sewing kits, etc. What they did provide was of a very good quality. There is no real reastaurant in the hotel other than Sam's Kitchen and most of the restuarants in close proximity were fairly costly. Soyou will have to explore and walk to find the perfect location for meals outside of the hotel. There are endless choices in Waikiki but many will involve walking a distance from the hotel.The only thing that I did not enjoy was the noise from all the sirens as the hotel is located very close to four major roadways (Ali Wai Blvd, Kuhio Avenue, Kalakaua Ave, and Kapahulu, which are used by the emergency vehicles. Keeping the windows closed did help somewhat, but the evening breeze was nice at night. Weekends were the noisiest as is the case with all big cities.If we travel with small children again this would likely be our hotel of choice.","Calgary, Canada","Carol C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",98,3.0

The first thing to understand is that this is not a real hotel. It is a condominium building where each unit is owned by a different person. Some of the rooms are then leased to Aston to be used as hotel rooms, so every room is furnished and maintained differently. Aston rates the rooms as A, B, or C. We were placed in a B room (816, Tower A) which is supposed to be a renovated room. Clearly, the standards that Aston uses to rate the rooms are pretty low. See the pictures. Here’s a short list of problems: No carpeting anywhere, water stains on the ceiling, clogged bathroom sink, dirty grout in the shower, uneven laminate floor tiles that looked like they were put down by a 5-year-old, burn marks on the laminate island top, caked food on the island, ancient appliances, sagging beds, faded curtains that had so many holes in them that it looked like a star show at a planetarium, and the overwhelming odor of burnt bacon. The staff at the Banyan was excellent. We did not want to move that night because the kids were exhausted after the long trip. In the morning, the front desk was more than willing to move us, but admitted that the room we were in was one of the nicer class B rooms. I’d hate to see a class C. For $20 per night more, they would upgrade us to a class A, and they let us look at the new room. It was well worth the upgrade. The new room on the 27th floor had a view of the ocean. The appliances were newer, and the bathroom was in much better shape. The bathtub drained very slowly. The bedroom was carpeted while the main area had ceramic tile. Again, not much skill at laying the tiles with grout stains all over the tiles, and some uneven tiles. The curtains were shears so at 6:30 AM, we were awake with the sun. All in all, this room, though far from luxury, was acceptable. Of course, we think Hampton Inn is fancy. If you plan to come to Hawaii and save some money by cooking your own dinners, this hotel is ideal. If you just want to be near the beach, come back to the room for lunch, perhaps cook a few meals during your stay, it can’t be beat. It is just 3 blocks from the Diamond Head end of Waikiki beach. If you want a poorly renovated room, get a class B room, otherwise upgrade to A. But remember, this is not a hotel. No business center, no ice machines, no dishwashers. You make your own ice with those old plastic cube trays.

First off, the hotel and the room looked nothing like the pictures. The kitchen was dirty and smelled bad. The carpet was filthy and needed to be replaced, (you never wanted to take your shoes off), the bed was lumpy and uncompfortable and the couch in the living room was ripped and also very dirty. The shower curtain was dirty and the bathroom very dated. The hotel has no central air conditioning, only a very old & noisy swamp cooler air conditioner, which leaked and did'nt do a very good job cooling the room. The elevators were extremely slow and also not air conditioned. The hotel is situated about 3 blocks from the beach and about 2 blocks from a canal, which had some of the biggest rats i've ever seen in my life! The Waikiki Banyan Aston was simply the worst place I have ever stayed and I will never stay in this ""roach motel"" again.","Ladera Ranch, California","bmw1976</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ladera Ranch, California</strong>",1,1.0

I chose to have a big room because my boyfriend's brother was staying with us. Anyway, at check-in me and my boyfriend were all dressed up and already late for prom. They were really nice and nothing weird happened... until I got in the room. The sliding door leading out to the lanai was WIDE open, the room didn't look like what I ordered online, and it looked stupid because there were not enough objects to fill such a big room. Also, where there was suppose to be a nice bar area, there was a ratty and lawn looking table with straw/bamboo type chairs that had holes and tears in them. Well I wanted to call to complain, but I didn't have any time because I was already late for prom. So me and my boyfriend left while his brother stayed back in the room.Later into prom night we get a call from my boyfriend's brother and he said that there were dirty towels under the sink that were not from any of us!After prom we went back to the room and I called the front desk to tell them that when I went into the room before leaving the sliding door was wide open, there were dirty towels, and the room is NOT what I had ordered. He kept asking, ""was there someone else in the room while you were gone?"" I kept telling him that shouldn't matter because all of this happened BEFORE I LEFT FOR PROM!! He was so stupid!! I was trying to complain about the housekeeping and he just kept blaming it on ""an intruder""!! WHAT??!! He wasn't apologizing for anything and it's as if he was blaming it on my boyrfriend's brother. I told him I wanted to switch rooms because this wasn't what I had ordered. He told me that he would just come up with fresh towels and make sure that my door was locked because there must've been an intruder.Half an hour after receiving my towels and making sure that my door was secure, I heard a couple people right outside my door. My boyfriend looked through the peep hole and saw the staff looking at the door and writing things down on a piece of paper. My boyfriend swung open the door and they stopped and looked at him and said, ""we had a complaint about loud noise."" I was just pissed!! They were blaming the noise disturbance on us when all we were doing was watching tv and talking story. When just down the hall was a family with little girls running up and down.I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO THIS HOTEL EVER AGAIN!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYBODY!!

Hotel staff stated they are encouraging owners to upgrade their condos. The condo is basic, don't stay here if you're looking for bells and whistles. Nice touches: full kitchen, big flat screen television, balconies facing the city, beach or Diamond Head, pool, hot tub and gas grills in common area, cheap parking ($10 daily) for Honolulu, free internet access in room.

PROS: Our room was the next door located out of the elevator, which was very convenient. We thought that we'd hear too much noise as other tenants passed, but this was in no way an issue.Sofa Bed: Upon our prearranged request, we were issued a queen sofa bed for the kids to sleep on.As my spouse and kids couldn't get a flight out, we had to amend our reservations. We dealt with 4 different employees throughout our 5-night stay and ALL were empathetic and accommodating to our situation.We had a full kitchen with dishes, pots/pans, and a full-sized refrigerator. Dish soap and greenie-weenie were available under the sink. A 4-cup rice cooker and coffee maker were available too.Convenient store and coffee shop with internet access located in hotel. This store had mostly everything like bread, beverages, eggs, laundry soap and other supplies. During our stay, the cafe charged for internet access $2.50 every 15 minutes, or $8 an hour. Beach access: The walk to Waikiki beach took us about 7 minutes. As their add had stated, upon our request the front desk issued our 2 kids sand pails and tools.Laundry room: One each of washer and dryer is located at one side of each floor for 75 cents a load.Pool, hot tub, BBQ area, and Sam's Kitchen: The pool was located on the 6th floor. There was also a mini golf spot to practice your shot. Along this area, there were additional lounge chairs to sun bathe on. We did not use the BBQ grills, but there were about 6 available for use. Sam's kitchen sold dishes of raw meat to grill. At this grill, there were many Thai and local dishes that were extremely delicious! The red curry was one of my favorites!International night market: We were able to walk to the market in about 10-15 minutes. Along this strip, there are a lot of shops to browse through. As we had our stay in the middle of the week, it'd be safe to say that the market is available on a daily basis. Upon this strip, you can also find the gold, silver, and newspaper men - males painted or covered in such...with a monetary tip in the jar, they welcome picture taking.Laundry mat located same distance, opposite direction as the beach.CONS: Parking: $10 fee for 24-hour parking. You'd think that just being a tenant would pay your way to such a fee, but not for this hotel. If you stayed in excess of 7 days, you can pay a lower flat rate.Bedroom/bathroom: The sliding section to separate the bedroom from the main room was not able to be secured - a regular door would've been much better!

Although the main beds aren't too bad to sleep in the hide away beds were extremely uncomfortable and not even close to being satisfactory to sleep in.

The room was easily big enough to accomodate three adults and 2 kids without feeling cramped and the hotel provided a crib for the baby at no charge. The full kitchen was perfect for our needs and the room was kept very clean by the housekeeping staff. The furniture was VERY dated and in poor repair (major rips and tears on the sofa for example) but for the amount of time we spent in the room, I wasn't about to complain. Cleanliness was more important and it was kept clean! The pool deck was quite windy and the pool was cold for the kids, but why would you stay at the pool when the most amazing beach was just a few minutes walk away? The Aston at Waikiki Banyan is perfectly situated to a section of Waikiki beach with a wonderful breakwater, creating the most tranquil lagoon for the children. We could play in the water with our kids without any fear of surf causing undertows or sand disturbances on unsteady young feet. We'd go to the beach in the morning and not return to the hotel until later afternoon...and our 2 year old could EASILY make the walk to the beach, so anyone that complains that this hotel is far from the beach has a rather distorted sense of a far walk. The playground on the pooldeck was fun for the kids for a quick outting to keep them occupied, and the little restaurant (I think it was called Sam's?) on the pooldeck served really good thai food. My baby ate the PadThai every 2nd day for lunch, she gobbled it up!The front desk staff were very helpful with bus, trolley and selfguided activities and were very accomodating when arranging a late checkout since we had an overnight flight and didn't leave the hotel until very late evening on checkout day.There are free hula shows every evening near to this hotel; it's easily walkable to the hula platform at the beach, the Royal Hawaiian Centre or the Int'l Marketplace. Tons of free entertainment in this town - wonderful for small kids that aren't ready for a full-on luau but still want some evening activities showcasing the beautiful Hawaiian culture. We didn't rent a car and absolutely felt we didn't need it since everything was walkable from the hotel.Overall, despite the dated decor, this hotel was a gem and I'd happily return in a heartbeat.

It was a great social place to gather. Very reasonably priced at $2.00 to use the barbeque. The house keeping staff were great! Our room was always sparkling clean. The only problem we had, was that a few times our room was not cleaned until around 4:00 p.m., but once we mentioned this to the desk staff, they came earlier in the day, which was great! The couch and chairs were a little worn, but the plus's outweigh the worn furniture.If you are booking a tour, book with the agent at the front desk. She was fabulous and had us all organized. She definatley knows her stuff. I would not book a tour from one of the many people you see on the street, as the cheap price usually means there is a catch - i.e. sitting through a high pressured time share presentation or the tour not being legitimate. Once again, the gal with Expedia was Fabulous! The desk staff was wonderful and wanted to make sure our stay was enjoyable. Our flight home wasn't until 11:15 p.m., we so requested a late checkout and they were able to accomodate us for a fee of $50.00, which was worth every penny. We had the room until 6:00 p.m. The desk fellow called us and said he would extend our time for no extra charge, which was greatly appreciated, as we went for dinner at 5:30 and had no place to go later. Our shuttle picked us up at 8:15., p.m., so this enabled us to go back to our room after dinner and gather our luggage and freshen up.The only complaint I have is the phone charge of .75 cents for a call. This really added up, as we called home to Canada often to check on family. Although I used my prepaid phone card, the .75 cents added up quickly. I would recommend using the payphone in the lobby. We would definately stay at the Banyon again. It is a very well run establishment and is affordably priced. We will be booking at the Banyon again next year!","Regina, Canada","chocolatemama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Regina, Canada</strong>",11,4.0

But why go to Hawaii and stay in the hotel. Get a car explore the island. Drive 1.5 MPH in rushhour LOL I love it :-). When I come home I feel like my rush our is a sunday drive.This hotel is great if you are only going to sleep there and cook.If you want a nice place to hang out don't come here.The only great thing was one staff member of the houskeeping group. If I ever stay here again I will request to be on her floor. Because of the great customer service and Ohana we receaved from her I will concider staying at this hotel again. and my family goes to Hawaii at least once a year.Ps If you are driving in Hawaii they don't use the turn signal, so have an eye and watch the cars around you and read the car body language, that is how you know they are changing lanes. Also don't honk your horn they concider it quite rude.Costco is the place to get cheep food and gas. The Sushi is great there and get the made in Hawaii BBQ sause the one with the red white and green lable best stuff in the world( it is called the Korean BBQ I think).Eat at least 1 meal at buzz's in Kailua, so good.I enjoy my stay if I avoid the tourist traps like Waikiki.There is a gym close it is a 24hr fitness and you can run on a tredmill overlooking waikiki bay so cool.Hit Hawaii and have funCheers chris","Canada,Calgary","landcruiserHJ61Chick</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada,Calgary</strong>",1,3.0

Why? We would have made it only for 1 night, but the other hotel that we wanted to switch to was all booked. We were quite shocked and disappointed in the room. The beds were so small, and extremely uncomfortable. They were so hard! Since there were three of us, one of us had to sleep on the the sofa bed. And that was on the other extreme of terrible! It was so soft, and springy. Man. Everything in the room was very old and outdated. The bathroom was very tiny, with a sliding door concept , and the wallpaper in the bathtub was ancient. The sink was very low, and that takes into account someone like myself who is 5'2. I felt like a giant leaning over to use the sink. Hilarious. And of course, who could not forget mentioning the television. It was like 30 years old. And the buttons didn't even work properly. We couldn't flip channels up and down, only up. You would think they could get modern, coming of age, new t.v.'s for the rooms seeing that they are so darn cheap now. We didn't even want to turn on the t.v. I would say that the only up side of staying here is the space, and that you have a full kitchen to use as you please. If you don't think the bed is the most important item for overall hotel satisfaction, and don't care what you sleep on, i.e., a rock, by all means go for this hotel. And if you really must stay here, I wouldn't recommend getting a room any higher than the 20th floor, or more. We were on the 37, and it was terrifying just sitting out on the lanai. Well that's another story, if you don't care for heights. The elevator was my favorite part of the hotel. It was new. But, then again it took so long to get up to our floor....So in conclusion, go for the Waikiki Circle instead. It's tiny, but it's right across from the beach. It was the same price as this one.

Parking was only $10 a day with in-out privelages even though spots are rather small. After checkout, we were provided towels and access to showers to change before heading back to the airport for evening flight home.

If you are looking to get away from the rat race you are in the wrong area. I enjoy the energy of a big city so I didn't mind it at all. My family all got separate rooms so we sort of had a cross section of the one bedroom condos. We all reserved standard rooms but all got a free upgrade which was a nice surprise. Each tower 2 condo was a carbon copy of each other but the little touches here and there made all the difference. Our condo was the one made of sticks, my sister's family (2 adults, children 14, 11) got the one made of brick, and my dad and brother got the straw house. Sister's (floor 35) had a larger tv, ceiling fans in the kitchen, and access to the bathroom from the living area. My family's condo (2 adults, children 20, 17, floor 27) was serviceable and exactly what you would think you would get. Not fancy or classy but like staying at your friend's who had no interest in dressing the place up. Dad's (senior and my younger brother, floor 16 with ocean view) had a bare bones condo. Probably exactly how the place came when they built the place in the 80's (my guess as far as decor). Nuts and bolts: Pool area and hot tubs are nice but seemed overrun with the kiddies. Parking ($10 a day, $60 for a full week) was reasonable and quite possibly the cheapest in the area. Internet access is now free but is not necessarily wireless. Bathroom is small but the living area and bedroom were roomy enough. Beds were pretty cheap and minimal, sofa bed was probably even worse although the kids didn't complain about it. Balcony iwas narrow but enough room to sit and put your legs up. Mountain view had a nice breeze in the evening and lights were quite beautiful. Dad's ocean was nice during the day but didn't get the trade winds that cool off the evening. Probably need to be over 28th floor for really nice ocean view. Bottom line? Try and preview your room first and remember expectations might be met but probably not exceeded. I hope I don't sound too negative.

Since each of the units are individually owned and maintained the condition varied but I was able to get an idea of the different locations, views and conditions of the building.We stayed there again recently and I was surprised at the condition of the three units. All were in very good condition and were very clean. We all had 1 bedroom units, which consists of a full kitchen, living room (with sofa bed), bedroom and bathroom. The bedroom and living room were separated by sliding doors. Nice to have that since the kids went to sleep before us and we were able to not have complete lights out.We stayed in tower 2 and it seemed that the elevators were renovated recently as well. The reasons why we stayed there included location to the Waikiki beach (about a 1.5 blocks), a kitchen and a reasonable price.The beach closest to the Banyan is behind the breakwater wall. It’s great if you have young children that can’t swim yet and can’t handle the waves. Staying in a condo is great since we normally don’t eat a large breakfast, we were able to easily prepare breakfast and a few light meals that otherwise we would have bought. There is a very new Safeway about a mile away so we were able to stock up on groceries very easily.Banyan has paid self-parking within the building. Very convenient if you are planning on renting a car though it’s a typical lot in a big city (spaces & navigation are quite tight!)Banyan is very close to the Zoo and aquarium and is a few steps from everything that Waikiki has to offer.

From the balcony, we could over look waikiki city, diamond head, & a good view of the ocean. It was very convinient to have a kitchenette too, saved us alot of money for breakfast.

There were 4 of us, including 2 kids (ages 7 & 10). In our opinion the condo could do with a makeover as the furnishings and carpet are a little old. However we found that the room met all of our needs. It was great having a full kitchen - we saved a lot of money making breakfast most mornings. The beds were comfortable and we didn't have any trouble sleeping!The resort is in a great location - close enough to all the hustle and bustle of the main part of Waikiki, but far enough away that the noise didn't bother you.The only complaint that we had was that the pool closed for 5 days for ""urgent"" maintenance 3 days after we got there. Considering it was the beginning of the summer season, we thought that the timing could have been a bit better. It would have been good if there were arrangements in place for guests to use another condo's pool close by. Having said that, the ocean was a block away so we still got to swim. With young kids, we found that it was easier ""popping down to the pool"" for an afternoon swim, rather than going that bit further to the beach.We hired a car for the entire time and we found this really useful. Although the public bus system is great, we were in a position to do what we wanted, when we wanted. Parking cost around $10 a day and you could also get a weekly rate.This is a really good place for families travelling with kids ... as long as the pool is open!","Sydney, Australia","cnaz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",1,4.0

The kitchen made it easy to cook which lowered our costs significantly (even if groceries do cost more over there). The pull out couch wasn't exactly comfortable, but we made due. The staff was very nice and helpful. But the best part for us was the location. A block away from the beach, a few minute walk to the International Market, and pretty much steps to anything else.

I had workspace to use my laptop with the provided high speed internet. I also had the option to sit out on the Lanai (patio) to do work. I didn't try it because I know I can't work while I'm staring out at the beautiful view. I also had the joy of watching sunsets from the Lanai or really anywhere in the condo. Being on the 21st floor was great because I slept with Lanai doors (with 8 - 10 foot opening) open every night. Another wonderful thing about the Condo has nothing to do with the condo is that I was about 5 minutes from the beach.

From the moment we checked in until we left seven days later, we were throughly and pleasantly surprised with our stay. If you're expecting a five-star hotel, look elsewhere. But if you're seeking a clean, comfortable and affordable location to stay while you enjoy Oahu, this is the perfect spot. The room may need some updates like new curtains and better furniture but we didn't come to Hawaii to stay in a room and look at curtains. We had a mountain-side view but did have nice view of the ocean from the kitchen of our 12th floor room. The kitchen was a huge plus even though we mainly used it for breakfasts and for drinks and snacks when we came back to the room at night. The parking garage rates at $10 a day and $60 for the week are cheaper than other places we found in Waikiki. The staff was friendly and helpful. At check-in, the clerk asked if we were visiting for a special event like a wedding or anniversary and it said it was our anniversary. He asked what day it was and on that evening when we returned to the room a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolates were waiting for us. What a great gesture to make hotel guests feel welcome. The hotel is about 3 blocks to the beach, which didn't bother us that much because we didn't spend a lot of time there. We were out seeing other parts of Oahu. It is on the far east side of Waikiki and away from most of the shops and restaurants. It is a bit of a walk if you want something good to eat, but I would suspect that it's also in a quieter location. We didn't experience any problems with noise at all. The recreation deck seemed very nice. We spent a couple of hours out there one night after the pool had closed and it was very quiet and relaxing. We thought the Waikiki Banyan was a great value. We were able to save some money for other activities while we were in Oahu and still came away with a good hotel experience.

I viewed the idea of having a kitchen at my disposal a great way to avoid eating out too often and making the trip more budget conscious. After arriving at the hotel quite late at night I was impressed with the lobby and greeted by a good front desk clerk who quickly gave me the hotel room access cards and also directions to the hotel parking which is adjacent and was $10 a day. I later found this not to be necessary as there are ample free parking spots on the streets surrounding the hotel which is a treasure hunt in itself!I stayed in a room on a high floor and with an ocean view. Although the view was obstructed to an extent by the Tower 1 building (which is part of the complex). The room itself was very dated, the furniture was quite old, the carpet was worn and needed cleaning and the bathroom was also quite worn and disappointing. The force of the shower head was absolutely terrible. The lamps in the bedroom were working sporadically and the TV in the main living area had terrible reception. The beds were also very lumpy and hard and during the whole stay, myself or my family members did not have a good nights sleep. There were also cockroaches throughout the unit and even though we had it sprayed by hotel staff they returned! Frankly I avoided returning to the unit for the very fact. Considering this is a $250+ hotel room (US Dollars), it was very disappointing indeed.The hotel had a good recreation deck with a pool and two hot tubs (both extremely busy all of the time!) and the sun hits the deck allowing for great sun tanning opportunities. Unfortunately the outdoor barbecues were quite dirty and not to mention barbecuing on them was a very time-consuming process! The hotel complex also included a small fast-food shop on the rec deck, convenient store on the main floor and a coffee/expresso shop (I still prefer the chain coffee though!). The location in a quieter area of Waikiki was also a plus, and its only a block away from the beach. I tried to keep balanced in my review but I probably will not stay at this hotel on my next visit nor would I recommend it to others. The notion of a kitchen area may be a plus but I realized after going on this trip that there is a big trade off in the overall quality of the room. Next time, I will put up with the extra costs of eating out as a means of getting a good nights sleep and I know my family members agree!","Edmonton, Canada","yegmark</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",116,2.0

We were searching for an alternative to a hotel room in Waikiki and were not disappointed in our choice of the Banyan. We requested a deluxe ocean view room and the hotel put us in a room on the 36th floor of the 37 floor tower. Although the room was a bit dated we had an unobstructed view of Diamond Head, which was very impressive. The location was also very handy for a morning walk around Queen Iolani Park and close enough to the beach at Waikiki so a car would not have been necessary. There was a Food Pantry within walking distance for larger grocery purchases, and we had laundry services at the end of the hall on our floor. A small convenience store in the hotel was surprisingly well stocked.The pool and barbeque area were on the sixth floor, and although we didn't use it, there was a take out window service for food and drinks which seemed to be quite convenient. The area also had a playground area for younger children.One concern we had was that other reviewers mentioned the slow elevator service; however we only encountered a bit of delay one time. We found the check in staff and hotel workers to be very friendly and helpful.We would recommend this condo/hotel to others looking to be in a quieter part of Waikiki, and we would definately stay there again.","Chilliwack, BC CANADA","Jean033</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chilliwack, BC CANADA</strong>",2,4.0

We are a family of four with 5 and 6 year old children. At check in the kids were given pails with shovels, squirt toy, crayons and coloring book. This was a wonderful treat as we did not have to spend extra money on sand toys. We were in tower 1 rm 2705. This room is right outside the elevators and we were concerned at first but over the seven days we never heard a sound. The view was wonderful(diamond head and partial ocean)and chairs and table on the lanai were a pleasant surprise. The room was clean and bright. This room looked like it had some work done on it as the carpet, flooring, and paint looked new. The bathroom had lots of storage and there was enough storage for clothes as well. The king size bed was sooo comfy (pillow top, possibly new).We had contacted the hotel before arriving to request a DVD player for the kids and it was there hooked up to the TV for us. The kitchen was well appointed with everything you could need for a weeks stay. Was nice to be able to make breakfast each morning in the room and save money for nicer dinners out.The 6th floor rec area was wonderful with the kids. There is a playground with pool and hot tubs and picnic/BBQ area. A couple of evenings as we were on a bit of a budget we used the coin op bbq's (worked very well) while kids played and swimmed then had a picnic outside. It was cost effective and fun!! For free you can sign out big beach towels to use during our stay which was nice as well as money saving.The hotel is in a wonderful location to everything. The beach has an area that is blocked by a wall so that there is no waves and is good for children. As the water is very calm here you can easily see many small fish and the kids had a good time trying to chase them. The general store on the main floor seems to have anything you could need and the info desk in the lobby is very helpful if you are a first time visitor. We also found all of the staff to be very friendly and attentive. A couple of times we left the do not disturb sign on our door and housekeeping always called later in the day to see if there was anything we needed or if we would like them to come right away to clean anything.

I really feel the need to relate the positive experience my friend and I had at the Banyan.It started at check-in, which occured at almost midnight. We had originally booked a Superior City View with twin beds. Somehow, during the booking process, the ""a"" was deleted from the end of my first name, leaving the masculine version of the name in place. There was an apparent assumption that my friend and I were a couple, and a room with a queen size bed was assigned! The error was quickly identified and rectified and we were then assigned an Ocean View room on the 22nd floor, with twin beds.This was my fourth trip to Waikiki and the fifth property I have stayed at. It was my friend's first trip. We were both very impressed with the accommodations. The room/condo was spacious, clean and well appointed, the appliances were modern and appeared to be new. The furniture was clean and comfortable, although I cannot report on the comfort of the hide-a-bed in the living room as we did not have opporunity to use it.If I have any complaint at all, it is that the mattresses on the beds were a bit on the soft side for my comfort. As mattresses are very much a matter of personal preference, it would be difficult for any property to please everyone, I am sure.The pool/recreation area was a delight. The pool had great exposure to the sun, lots of deckchairs, a little snack bar (with a great assortment of smoothies available), tennis court, putting green and ""pay-for-use"", coin operated gas barbecues in place.The area is very family-friendly and indeed, the entire property appears to be family oriented. Any property or hospitality based business venture is only as good as the staff, and in my estimation, the folks working at the Waikiki Banyan are top knotch. Prompt attention and courteous responses to our queries or concerns was the norm. Cliff, one of the desk clerks, Candy, our housekeeper, and the young woman working at the Expedia desk come to mind as being outstanding and memorable. Along with the outstanding accommodations, these folks have helped determine my opinion that the Waikiki Banyan is my new favourite in Waikiki and this will not be my last visit with them.","Camrose, Canada","bpet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Camrose, Canada</strong>",10,4.0

I suspect lower floors don't have much view as surrounding buildings would block much of it. The room was in great need of updating!! The kitchen cabinets and carpet are the original 1970's-80's decor and many things are marked, chipped and old. The housekeeping staff I am sure do their best to keep things clean but the majority of the hotel (at least our room) is in need of updates. We didn't have any problems with elevators as other visitors had but our visit was in November, not high time.The location of the hotel was a bonus, a short 2 block walk to a nice part of Waikiki beach and all the waterfront shopping. I did enjoy sitting on the lanai in the evening watching people and traffic below.

Randy in reservations was very knowledgeable and genuinely helpful. We had an oceanview 1 bedroom corner suite on the top floor (38th) in Tower 2 and it was more than what we expected in terms of size and location within the hotel. Although dated (the owners could put a few thousand into the room and it would make all the difference) it was clean and comfy, and the views were amazing: sweeping panaroma from Diamond Head to the Waikiki beaches.Parking was easy ($10/day) and the beach and good surfing was a quick 2 minute walk.Compared to the price of other properties right on the beach, without kitchens and subject to more traffic noise, we thought the Banyan was great value.

Resortquest, the managers of most of the units in the building, didn't have a unit available for our selected dates. I did some researching and found Koko Resorts also manages some of the units in the WB. What a gem they are!! The unit we stayed in (Tower 2-907) had a decor theme that can best be described as ""Grandma's place""; this wasn't a surprise as we had previewed pictures of a few of the units and chose the least attractive... and cheapest one.... our plan was to be outside most of the time. After reading reviews on this website about other units, I was worried about bugs. NO WORRIES!! The unit was super clean but if mismatched dishes and older appliances would ruin your vacation, this is not the place for you. There are other units to choose from and the property managers will go to unbelievable lengths to make sure you're happy with your stay. From booking to check out, they gave us 5 diamond service all the way. Elizabeth, the reservations agent, promptly answered all of my emails and advised me when she would be unavailable and another employee would handle my booking. We had a couple of special requests that they promptly confirmed and followed through with. Check in was smooth as we had the combination to a lock that was left on the door which contained our key. Guests of KOKO Resorts don't have access to the front desk at the Waikiki Banyan. Instead, Koko Resorts maintains an office on another floor that is open from 10-4 weekdays (not sure about Saturdays & closed on Sunday). For after hours emergencies we had a cell number to call. We visited the office a few times and each time we were greeted with a friendly welcome from the managers and staff, and answers to our questions. We also had access to boogie boards, surf boards, beach mats, umbrellas, binoculars, etc.. It would appear that the gear is available on a first come, first served basis but it was way beyond what we expected when we booked the unit. When I was researching accomodation options, I told the res agent that I was choosing between one of Koko's units and another unit managed by someone else. She told me that Koko Resorts was a relatively new company (started in Jan./08) and that they really wanted our business and would do whatever they could to make our stay enjoyable. From our experience, this philosophy is shared by everyone at Koko. Matt, the onsite manager, went to great lengths to make our stay enjoyable. Without hesitation, I would recommend Koko Resorts at the Waikiki Banyan! After the service we received, I wouldn't even consider booking elsewhere in Waikiki.",Canmore1,"Canmore1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canmore1</strong>",0,5.0

This was my 6th time staying at a Resortquest property, though we have primarily stayed at the Maui locations. I was somewhat skeptical of this property after reading other reviews but we decided to stay here anyways because of the play area, pool and proximity to the beach. Our experience with Resortquest has been to ask upon check-in to view two rooms and they have always complied. That is exactly what we did on this stay so that we could see if one was more outdated than the other. At this property, all units are individually owned and can vary depending on what the owner has opted to do. We went to our first two rooms in tower 2 and were disappointed. The beds were hard and everything was clean but outdated. We returned to the front counter and we were able to view another two rooms. The last room is what we decided to take because the carpeting was new, the bathroom was upgraded and the pullout bed seemed as if it had not been slept in. The queen in the room, however, was a different story and we had blankets sent to the room to provide more cushioning and that was fine. Our room (see attached photos) was tower 1, #3604. When you walk into the room, the kitchen is directly to your left. It had a bar area that seated 4. It was equipped with silverware, glasses and plates for 6. It had a microwave, stove and refrigerator- no dishwasher. Then came the family room and there were three doors that could be closed or stay open into the bedroom. In the bedroom was the bathroom. We also had a lanai with a partial ocean view. My parents were in tower 2 #3801 with a mountain view/ alawai view and I had other family in tower 2 #2802 - full ocean view and they had adequate rooms as well. We never saw any ants or cockroaches at the property the entire time we were there. There are laundry facilities on each floor with one washer and dryer. They were $1.50 per load each.It is interesting to note that when you walk in, there is an open air lobby, a beautiful waterfall with koi and the rooms do not convey the feel of the lobby. Yes, the elevators are being worked on. Three of the four have been upgraded in each tower. Since there are 38 floors in tower 2 and 37 in tower 1, we consistently joked about the elevator waits. I think that since there is 800+ rooms here, this would be an issue with only 8 elevators (though 6 were working while we were there). The parking garage recently increased rates to $10 per day or $60 for 7 day blocks. This is operated by a different company than Resortquest and you must pay cash (no credit cards). We booked directly through Resortquest and used our entertainment card, which has provided us a great discount whenever we have stayed with this company.

We rented 3 units..that went from alright, to ok to awful. The first room actually had a headboard etc with a king size bed, but it was also suppose to have a pull out sofa bed. It was not there. So instead that room received a cot that looked worse then a hospital bed. The stove would either get really hot or the element would not even heat up and not all of them worked. The bathrooms are super tiny and the utinsels smell old, and this was the best room out of the three. The second one had a queen bed which was fine. Very oudated though. The pull out sofa bed was awful!!! I can still feel it in my back, we eventually asked for extra blakets to soften it but that didn't really work. Then came the cockroaches...we came in one night and my husband thought he got both but in the morning when he went to go throw them out one was gone so we had our room sprayed and then they all started coming out...The third room was suppose to have a pull out sofa bed, however it had a nice label stating ""BROKEN"", the king size bed had no head board, the shower would go from hot to cold, the lamps did not work.....the carpet was from the 70's and even the stove was ancient...it was awful (room 801 tower 1), and they had little ants all over the counters..Well I can go on and on but I will stop there, the pool was good and the kids play area was nice and the lobby was nice.

We stayed 5 days in Wakiki being tourists and the headed to Kona for 9 days. While in Waikiki, we stayed at The Banyon. Great place!The Banyan is located a long block from Queen's Beach in Waikiki. You can get to ANYTHING you need in 5 minutes. It's a perfect location. You must go only to the ABC stores for anything you need. There is practically one of every corner, and the prices are very reasonable. (Our grandson said these stores were one of his favorite parts of Hawaii!)Our room was on the 33rd floor, room #3310. From our lanai we could look left and see the beach and ocean, look right and see the mountains and valley. We had a one bedroom condo with kitchen and bath. The bedroom had a queen and single, perfect for 3 people!The Banyan is NOT glitzy. If you are expecting a super-resort, you will not find it here. But it is a very nice hotel, very clean and has a lot of character.You can get internet service in your room for a fee. I think we paid $29 for a week. There's also free WiFi in the new coffee cafe downstairs.The pool is small, but do you really go to Hawaii for the pool? I do recommend the EXCELLENT snack-shack at the pool. You can get all sorts of local food and hamburgers. He also has delicious ice cream and shaved ice.Yes. As warned, the elevators are incredible slow, but they are putting in new ones. They work on one at a time, and this slows down the others. Just relax and be prepared to wait. What's the hurry?Would we go to The Waikiki Banyon again?

Our whole experience, overall, was again wonderful. The ladies we that we spoke with in reservations were great. Very helpful and cheerful. The room we got this time was not what we'd expected. After speaking with the Front Office supervisor, Len, we discovered that there had been an misunderstanding regarding the room type. The condo was full at the time, and room changes were not available at that moment. We understood that and were asked to wait for the next day to see what they could do. We were fine with that. The room we had been given was great, nice, clean, etc - it was just our view preference that we were requesting to change. Len handled our request the following day and to our surprise he was able to get us in the same room we had been in the year before - and totally not expected. BONUS!! His effort and professionalism were very appreciated. We had booked a tour that day we were to move which was no problem, as the staff just asked us to have our bags, food, ready and when we came back - everything had been moved for us. Bags in the room, food in the fridge - perfect!The condo is a little worn, however, well maintained at the same time. Various kinds of maintenance was occuring in our tower - always a good sign. The elevators were being worked on while we were there. We didn't have any issues about the wait times - we were on vacation, after all, and in no rush for anything. We never waited more than a few minutes. The computer room was unavailable this year as the Banyan Breeze was being worked on. The Front Office staff kindly offered to print out our boarding passes, etc for us while this room was unavailable. The rooms were clean, and attended to promptly every day. We enjoyed the fact that we were able to fix quick meals and save in that area so we could use our money on other things on the island. We found the new Safeway (behind the canal - a few blocks back). We took The Bus (not sure what number) which stops right there, and had Safeway call us a taxi on the way back.  We used the Internet service in the room and while there was a nominal charge for the service, the convenience far outweighed the cost.  We liked the location of the condo. It is a block from the beach in the quieter area of Waikiki. Nothing is too far - and we soon learned the convenience of the The Bus and used it often. Will be go back?

I had read many of the reviews on Trip Advisor so I had seen a couple that had mentioned roaches, but I had hoped that these were the exceptions and that I would be lucky enough to avoid this problem. Unfortunately, this was not the case.Our first room was in Tower 2--room 3510. It was infested with cockroaches in the bathroom and the kitchen. It was sprayed but that did no good and we had to spend 1 day of our vacation packing up all of our belongings (for us and our children) and moving to another room and then unpacking again. The second room was also Tower 2-room 2610. This room was infested with small ants in the bathroom and kitchen as well. Housekeeping sprayed twice but that also did nothing. We did not want to waste another day of our vacation moving so we lived with the ants.We were told by one person at the front desk that this problem is common and well-known to the staff and that they can't control it. My question then is why do they keep putting people in these rooms if they know they are full of cockroaches and ants? Are there some people who like to spend their vacations with bugs in their rooms, their food, their beds? I doubt it.I can say that the front desk manager that helped us through this was wonderful and apologetic and helpful as he could be. He did credit us some on our bill, but I can honestly say that I would not stay there again and I would not recommend the property to others.

Decent location relative to shops, activities, and shopping. Staff are nice and helpful.Not so good: They are busy fixing / replacing elevators, and it needs it. too many waits for the next one... Stay on the lower floors so you can take the stairs down, and elevators aren't a problem. Also good to get to and from the pool / BBQ deck. The deck gets pretty windy, but this didn't bother us too much, the sun also tracks around pretty good during the day, and you have to shift around to follow it.We had no troubles walking anywhere with our three boys (17, 15, 12), and they really enjoyed the boogie boarding, surfing, and jumping off the dock (learn from or watch the locals first!). We had great times playing around and shopping the strip in Waikiki. Lots to see and do, and the action picks up in the evening too. We even walked to and from Diamond Head, but you'd better be in shape and ready for a slurpie when you're done! Our kids really enjoyed the hike once we got there, but they wouldn't do the walk to the crater again.We were on the 7th floor, and would highly recommend it (or the 6th) as we could easily get to the pool deck and BBQs without waiting for an elevator. We always used the stairs to go down as it was very quick. We also parked on the highest level of the parkade (5th), so we could get to our car easily.We had fun at the water slides, the North shore, cruising the East side of the island, but mostly Waikiki. We should have rented surfboards at the North Shore, but the waves were a little big for our liking.We would recommend the Aloa Moana Mall for shopping, and the 1$ theatre about 4 blocks West of the mall. They run 2nd run movies, and we went almost every night just to get out. The theater has free parking in the parkade if you get your stub validated at the theater. Hilo Hatties was kind of a disappointment, as we were expecting larger, and more stuff, but this shouldn't mean you shouldn't go, it's just our opinion.Hanauma Bay was very disappointing, as there has been such a big change since we were last there 20 years ago. Very few fish, too crowded, and you can't feed the fish anymore. I guess the tourists have spoiled it over the years, too bad.We should have taken more opportunities to snorkel, but we didn't do any research first, and our kids just wanted to play anyways.My first choice was to go to Maui, but my wife convinced me there would be more to do / see for our kids in Waikiki. She was probably right, and we were very happy with our trip.Sorry I can't give any restaurant advice, we ate in our suite almost every time, and packed lunches on our excursions. We chose to spend our money on other things. There is a smorg / buffet 5 blocks West of the Hotel, and I wouldn't recommend it as it was underwhealming to us. We have been to a lot of All-Inclusives, and this buffet doesn't carry a candle to most we have been to.Costcos are in the area. One just behind Hilo Hatties / Dole Pineapple factory, and the other is East of Waikiki just before Hanauma Bay area. Good for food, waterslide tickets, Booze, and boogie boards / snorkleling gear. Safeway is the nearest, and variety isn't too bad for a smaller store.The boys liked to feed bread to the fish in the canal, and they followed us as we walked along. Kind of neat!

The woman who helped us had the inside scoop on alot of tours as to whether or not they wre worth doing.The room itself was exactly what you see in the pictures, one bedroom, living with foldout bed, a dinette, and most importantly a balcony with a great view where the kids 9 and 6 spent most of their time in the room.

We like the suite type accomodation, despite the fact that the hotel is not on the beach and that the building is like many in Waikiki, 30+ years old and a bit frayed at the edges. It is great not having to eat every meal out and the Banyon's location and adequate parking make it easy to have a car for excursions and short trips outside of Waikiki. With a teenager, I found the extra room a big plus. The slow elevators drove the mildest of guests to mutter. They are being replaced, but who knows when they will all work and how much of a difference they will make. If you are used to business hotels, you may not like the nickel and dime skimpiness of the Banyon. I received a newspaper only once, but looked for it every day. I found the $3 to bounce a basketball each time a special irritation. But I must say, all in all, I enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and had a good vacation there.

We a have week at a timeshare in Key West, Florida, that we traded for a week at the Banyan. The place in Key West is a Hyatt, which is smaller and very nice so we were expecting to find something comperable. No such luck. The Banyan is more like a Super 8 than a Hyatt. This hotel is just okay. Not terrible but certainly not great either. If it were a budget hotel we'd paid $60 for, I would have felt we got our money's worth. The rooms were clean, but not spotless (and crawling with roaches). The furnishings were acceptable, but not exceptional (the bed was actually very hard). Overall, you could do better for you're money.The nicer features of the hotel are its location, the kitchenettes, and the staff. The hotel is very close to the beach, though the view of the ocean is blocked by larger hotels around it. But it does have a nice view of the moutnatins. Though the rest of the room was old, the kitchen was recently renovated. The staff was very friendly, particularly the concierge. But we had serveral major issues with the Banyan. First and foremost, they were painting and doing other maintaince on our floor. This is an understandable issue in any hotel, but being woken up at 8am to sanding or people talking and playing radios in the hall is never enjoyable. One morning, they wanted to paint the doors and frames and to put some bug control treatement (which didn't seem to work) down the sink. About 9am, someone knocked on the door and let themselves in without waiting for a reply. 9am isn't that early, but we were on vacation, and still in our PJ's. It was incredibly awkward and emabarassing. What if one of us had just stepped out of the shower!!! Once open, the door had to be left open for painting and drying for hours. Security was provided for this time, and the maintaince staff was very poliet about it, but it was still incredibly unpleasant.The pool was also a major disappointment. The facitilies themselves were actually nice enough, with a pool, two hot tubs, tennis courts, and grills for bbq-ing. But the entire area was constantly overrun by kids. Nothing against kids, but when you don't have any, you don't usually want to spend your vacation with them. The pool and hot tub areas were particuarlly annoying. There are two hot tubs. One is too hot to sit in comfortably, and the other is barely luke-warm. Both are filled to capacity with kids jumping from one to the other. This is probably a great place of families with kids, especially young kid, but not for young couples, singles or older travelers. The elevators were also impossibly slow. The once they arrive, they are so crammed you can barely get in. We ended up taking the stairs to our 12th floor room as often as not. If we had been on a higher floor, I don't know what we would have done.Overall, I would not recommend the Banyan.

However, I believe that this is where our problems started. We noticed a cockroach on the kitchen counter the next day but were not too alarmed as we thought that this was a one off occurrence. Over the next few days, we noticed more cockroaches and therefore called housekeeping. They came up and sprayed behind the refrigerator. Because of the smell of the insecticide, we left the apartment and came back two hours later. The insecticide worked as we found 8 to 10 dead cockroaches. We threw out all of our food that we had placed on the counters and in the cupboards.The next day we continued to see smaller cockroaches. We spoke to the manager and asked that he consider rebating us some of the price of our stay. All he would do was credit back one day of internet fees and two local phone calls (total of $11.45).

We stayed on the 9th floor and the room's carpet and curtains were pretty stained and worn. The furniture was sufficient. we did get a shock in the elevator on the second day when we were confronted by two massive dogs and their owner. Being Australian and not used to this, we were kind of grossed out by dogs in the hotel room, maybe it was an owner of a private apartment but it was very weird. As most people say the elevators were slow, especially on the morning we checked out it took over 20 minutes wait. The staff neglected to give out the kids packs on arrival and I had to ask for them later, they also didn't send up champagne as ordered for arrival, I had to call down to remind them. We didn't really see any other staff as we were out all day, but the rooms were always clean and tidy on our return. So to sum up the location is great and price was good for a family of five and the facilities were acceptable.","Brisbane, Australia","brissiemum</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",23,3.0

To see it so spacious and welcoming and filled with light (a corner unit) was wonderful. My husband and I desperately wanted a 1-bedroom as we were with our 13year-old son and they seemed difficult to find. This was great value. Yes, the lifts were slow but it is close to the beach and we really enjoyed that gorgeous Waikiki lagoon, also the Banyan's large pool and spa tubs. The pool was noisy our first day but then, we were only on Floor 8. The noise those buses make when they start up! also impinged on our sleep. Our kitchen didn't seem very well-equipped. There was no kettle or teapot, we had to use the coffee-maker. Overall though with the size and a great bath, comfy sofas and chairs, the large lanii and Jeff (Thomas's associate) being so accommodating - we would definitely recommend it.

It was great because we went to farmers market and got lots of food for cheap and ate cheaply the whole week.I would reccomend not having a ocean side view. The hotel is blocked by most other buildings. The hotel is located one block away from the zoo, the beach and many ABC stores. If you are a runner, from the hotel and around diamond head is a good five mile loop! The lobby area is outdoors and very nice. Parking is $50 a week, but a lot cheaper than most other places which can be up to $15 a day! We were always able to find a lot of parking and the parking lot is well attended. There are two hot tubs that have varying temp, which is nice because i don't like it as hot as other people.The elevators were pretty slow, but that is also because one of the elevators were out, but a little wait is definitely worth it. There is also a little mini mart in the downstairs lobby. It has a lot of things and can sometimes be cheaper than the ABC stores.The house keepers were great and super fast when we called them for extra things.

All kitchen equipment that we could have needed was supplied and the lounge area and bedroom were very spacious. We stayed on the 33rd floor in tower two and booked mountain view rooms, so we were looking back over the canal and golf course. We were really happy with the view (we have a water view at home, so it was refreshing for us to look at something different for a change). We had two rooms next to each other, one for another family member and the second room had been recently refurbished and was much more modern looking.The hotel location was perfect for us - a two minute walk to a child safe beach, close to the zoo and aquarium and a really easy walk to the shops and marketplaces of Waikiki.

This hotel is what it is.If you are looking for a hotel that is top of the line, fancy furniture, plasmas, hotel staff kissing the ground you walk on and being able to have all that you need at your fingertips, this is not the place to be.If you want a place to relax, sleep in, do whatever you want to do, have a kitchen to save some money on food and cook when you want to, and overall just be left alone, this is the place for you.We found this to be perfect for us. We've been to Hawaii twice before so we weren't looking for a luxurious place. Be honest, you are in PARADISE, why do you need luxury and all of the perks when you should only use the hotel to sleep and bathe? Yes, the furniture of this hotel is a little out dated, but you have everything you need.We had an ocean view room on the 38th floor. When we came in, the room smelled incredible and it was very clean. The room was by far the largest suite I've been in. It was easily a liveable space for 4-5 people. So for two, it was beyond what we needed. The kitchen had all the utensils we needed and then some, from plates, pots, pans, forks, spoons, bowls, you name it, they had it. The counters were clean and useful for eating, the living room had a sofa bed that was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was clean and spacious. Great lighting, HUGE bed that could fit 3-4 people easily. A Fabulous view (albeit it is two blocks from the beach). The only thing missing from this place was the usual phone calls or visits from hotel staff. But this was PERFECT for us. We wanted to feel like we were home. There is no need for someone to call you every hour asking if everything is ok or always be knocking on your door. This felt like our apartment and for once felt like we were l iving in paradise.The ammeneties are great. Awesome secluded pool area, great saunas, tennis courts, golf area and GRILLS! You can actually buy some meat and cook it on the out door grills! The front area is all out doors so you get that nice island breeze when you are checking in or waiting for cars. The area is great, is secluded enough from the traffic, yet close enough to the beach.Overall, this place is great for the people who want what I described. Again, if you are looking for luxury and pampering, go somewhere else. If you want to feel like you live in Oahu, stay here.","Oakland, California","NorCal630</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",5,4.0

I met AU friends who arrived a few days before me. We had two rooms directly across from each other which worked out wonderfully since there was one bath per two women (four of went on this trip). 1202 was the better of the two with a nice water view and a larger space. 1201 needs the carpet replaced badly but had a nice nighttime mountain view of the lights on the hillside. Overall I would definitely consider the Banyan again since it was a convenient three blocks from Waikiki and the shops so great location. The rooms were clean but no frills. The full kitchen and the generous space including a lanai made it very comfortable and daily maid service was nice. Banyan--the units need blenders! Great cheap place to eat--pick up lunch or even dinner for a beachside meal at the Hyatt Regency snack bar on Waikiki Beach. Great value ($5 burgers, $6 chicken katsu) and huge portions makes this an absolute must. Closes at six however. Go to the Tiki Grill for nachos with kalua pig for $14.

What we got was essentially a 1 bedroom condominium with full kitchen (including cooking ware, dish towels etc.) and a view of both DiamondHead and the ocean. This kind of room was not guaranteed, but was not considered an upgrade. Although the room needed to be refreshed with new carpet and decour, it was clean and comfortable and an incredible bargain for the cost. The elevators were slow (we were on 26th floor) and you have to share them with service staff doing cleaning/removing garbage etc. - so this is not a fancy hotel. But it is only 3 blocks off the beach and super convenient to everything. I highly recommend this hotel for a great value experience. It even has a large pool (not on the beach, but with a view since it's on the roof of the 6th floor).

Be prepared for the room size, they are small. We stayed with 5 of us, one area has 2 queen beds together close and the other bedding is the fold out lounge. If you want the larger more established hotel chain type rooms you will of course pay the premium but this is what we expected, and wanted. The time we spent in the room is sleeping and changing, we spent all the time walking around and swimming/surfing so if it's this type of 'base of operations' room rather than one to live in, this is the place for you.It has a great pool, spa and barbeque area and internet access along with a car park, which we did not use.The location is quiet and safe and a short walk to the beach and the strip. It is the perfect mix of cost, room and location.The only downside are the lifts, you can wait 10 minutes (not exaggerating) for a lift and all three of them will turn up together. They are old and slow and is not helped by the staff using the lifts to travel one floor. There were 4 lifts and one of them didn't work for the entire time we we there.

Front desk staff were helpful, and my two year old daughter enjoyed the kids gift (bucket, shovel, sunglasses, stickers). Negative: First problem then presnted it self, the wait for an elevator was looooong, like 5 minutes. Only 3 were working, and by the time it got to the lobby it was like a cattle call, depending on where you were standing dictated if you got on the elevator! Room:Positive: The room was large, and adequate for our needs. The full kitchen is nice, with plates, utensils, bowls, pots and pans all provided. The view from the balcony (lanai in hawaii) was quite nice, watching the sunrise in the morning was nice. Negative: The carpets were very worn and had numerous stains throughout. When we booked our room, we were told that there was a hideaway couch / bed, however when we went to open it, there was a sign stating that it was broken. Housekeeping brought a single sized cot to replace it, however the person sleeping on it was too big for it. There were a number of ants throughout, but no roaches that other people complained about.

The building itself is not bad. There are several companies that rent out the condos in the Waikiki Banyan building. We were with Hawaiian Sun Holidays. Our room was suitable but it was really old and ugly. It was a one-bedroom with a closing sort of wall that separated the room from the living room/kitchen. It's pretty small for what we're used to. We were on the 10th floor. I was told that the rooms higher up were nicer- ours was definitely not. However, it was livable. On the first night we were there, after a 12hour+ journey through air and land, the fire alarm woke us up at 4am. After about an hour of false alarms and telling everyone to stop calling the office to ask what it was, it finally stopped.They conveniently forgot to mention that the pool would be closed for maintenance on the week we were there. When the pool finally opened, we realized we didn't miss much- the beach is much nicer. They have a little playground and basketball/tennis court by the pool with a little stand that sells some food and toys. The kitchen had a full fridge, stove, sink, and pretty much everything you needed to never have to eat out.The location, however, is fantastic! Just a block from the best part of Waikiki beach. Walking distance to almost everything in Waikiki. The front desk was helpful and nice. The Hawaiian Sun Holidays staff was also very nice. They had some old books and videos (VHS) available to borrow on the honor system. Not very impressive, but nice. Overall, it was decent. We would probably never stay there again unless we had a nicer room. You have to walk by the Marriott Waikiki whenever you walk to the beach and it's just kind of a depressing reminder of what your resort/room is not.Oh yeah, and Teddy's burgers around the corner (across from the zoo) are absolutely delicious and inexpensive.","Ontario, California","angellovestotravel</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ontario, California</strong>",24,2.0

I had read all the reviews- after our travel agent booked us in, just before we left for Hawaii. I was very worried as so many of the reviews were quite negative- particularly with the possibility of cockroaches in the room, as our daughter has a phobia about these creepy crawlies. However we enjoyed our stay there and had no issues with cleanliness, bugs, staff, lifts or any of the other negatives listed in earlier reviews. We were in room 3206 in Tower 1. We had paid for a deluxe Ocean View room and thought this was worthwhile as we often ate breakfast sitting on the balcony. You are side on to the sea, but definitely get a great view- as well as city lights at night. The carpet looked pretty new, and while the outfitting of the room is a little dated, it was clean and provided everything we wanted. Yes the bathroom is small, but entirely adequate and access for a family is no problem. Parking our rental car in the attached garage was no problem and the $8 per 24 hour period seemed a reasonable cost. Location is fine- while you are at one end of the Waikiki strip, the walks did us good and ensured we explored more thoroughly.Staff were always helpful and room servicing was probably more than we would expect for a self contained apartment. The recreation deck is basic if compared to a 5 star resort, but considering the cost and style of this accommodation, it was quite good. One thing though- they lock the BBQs at 9pm- which we found out the one night we were very late cooking dinner!Would we go back? Based on our experience yes. We also spoke to several people in the lifts who had returned to the Banyan year after year and who had no problems.

The room was clean and big enough for us to spread out. Having a kitchen with a big refrigerator and all of the appliances was great for buying some food and drinks to save a little bit of money. The pool area on the 6th floor was nice and never really crowded. The was only 1 instance were the elevators were slow but seeing as how it was a holiday week it was understandable and wasn't enough to bother us. This was our 2nd trip to oahu. Last time we stayed at the Pacific Monarch. Both times we booked rooms through a vacation rental website. Bang for your buck, I highly reccomend this as you will save alot of money (I believe the average price for the room we had is $200/night, we payed $125/night). You still get to use all of the things that regular hotels do. The price of our room also included a parking pass. The parking deck was always open and never completely full. This hotel is on the quieter end of Waikiki near Kapiolani park. It is only 1 block from the ocean and the bus and trolleys stop next door at the Hilton Prince Kuhio.

It was much better than I thought it would be and I would highly recommend it. They are condo style rooms. Rooms were very spacious - I had the bedroom and my brother took the fold out sofa bed in the living area, which he thought was very comfortable. The condo had full kitchen utilitys and the bathroom area could be accessed from the living area or the bedroom, so you wouldnt be disturbing the other person in the night. It was very clean and from the balcony we could see the beach, which was less than a five min walk. It was very convienent to everywhere. Also the recreation deck and pool was very nice too. It is busy at times as noted in previous posts but I normally was just there in the evening just chilling out a bit after day on beach or trips. We did book this through a private rental and not through the hotel itself- we booked it through Captain Cook resorts and found them very good to deal with. They met us with key at the condo when we arrived. So i suppose i cant vouch for the quality of all the rooms but some of my family did book in for a few days in another room and it was pretty similar , our one was probably decorated a bit better ( but it is someones home ) and you have to walk through the bedroom to get to the bathroom- but really I don't think thats too much of a big deal. They had no complaints apart from a few ants in the sink - but the peolple at the desk sorted that out. Its best too to book a room on the higher floor- we stayed on the 30th floor- much nicer view. some of the rooms face the recreation deck too , so get a sea view if possible. Overall all very pleased with the space in these condos and would go back there again.Oh and great value for money too , compared to price of some of the hotels in the area- and with them you just get the room .",ireland,"IrelandRose</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>ireland</strong>",3,4.0

Most negative comments that I read related to room cleanliness, staff attention/service, the slowness of the lifts and its location however I did not see these as a real problem - some people must be hard to please !!.The only drawback I found was the location that added 10/15 minutes each way to our walk into the centre if Waikiki.

All this was happening as I was holding our 11 month who was beginning to get upset because it was approaching her dinner time. We were given our room and upon entering it looked like a set for a porno movie due to the REALLY dated/dirty furniture, the dirty carpet, chrome bar stools and to top it all off the mirrored wall. We did not expect to stay at a 5 star resort with what we were paying but we did expect something a bit better than this. The lifts are a nightmare and one of the lifts was out for repairs for the whole duration of our trip.

I would say it is geared towards families. It is a little old but not too bad. It had an oven, microwave, large fridge, everything we needed. I would not pay to use the safe. I think it's done on an honestly thing as the key is left in the door. I think this is wrong to be charged for the in room safe at $2.62 a day. We used it after the maid had been just incase she monitors if it is being used. I found the staff to be very rude and not helpful at all on front desk.

Sometimes the lifts would stop on Level 22 for no reason. No one pressed the button but it would stop here and just open and shot the door a couple of times. Very strange.

It was excellent ! We miss Hawaii already.The one bedroom apartment was newly renovated and very spacious, much bigger than a standard hotel room. There was a full kitchen, living area with a couch (which opened up into a sofa bed), a separate bedroom and bathroom. The Waikiki Banyan is close to the beach (1 block), and close to the bus stops. You can take the bus to virtually any place in Oahu - very useful indeed. It was a short walk from everywhere.I booked the apartment directly through the owner (Thomas Edwards) through a website that I found on the internet: stayinwaikiki (808-221-1311). It was excellent value and Thomas was very helpful in providing information. When I go back to Hawaii (which is a matter of when, not if) I will definitely stay there again. I would recommend anyone booking with this owner.There was no problem with elevators, no sign of cockroaches and in our apartment had no dated decor. The apartments were quiet and accomodated all of our needs.For all travellers considering visiting Waikiki and Hawaii, I would highly recommend it ! The beaches are clean, the people are friendly, great big serves of food, good tours and places to visit. I only went for 8 days which I found a little short in time because it is a great place with so many things and other islands to visit. At a mimimum, go for 10 days to ensure that you get to experience all of the wonderful places that Hawaii has to offer.Just another word of note, we flew Jetstar from Melbourne to Honolulu which is the first time that we have flown with this aircarrier and it was a great airline.

Overall we think that it was a good value for the money. I think that each condo unit has individual owners so I'm guessing that the room quality is not consistent. I believe this is so because I met some of the locals that live in the Waikiki Banyan Condo. The good things about the condo are:1. The location. The condo is at the far east side of Waikiki but still within walking distance of all of the attractions. It is located two short blocks from the beach and happens to be in an area of the beach that has sea walls in the water which made it a wonderful place for my toddler to swim. Someone commented that they did not care for the neighborhood. I found nothing wrong with the neighborhood and I consider myself to be somewhat picky. The condo is right behind the Marriott and you know that a Marriott would not set up shop in a questionable neighborhood.2. The room was quiet. We were right next to the elevators and we did not hear a sound at night.3. The front desk was very accomodating. I had to receive some faxes while I was at the condo and it was not a problem....although they did charge me for it of course.4. There is a playset for the children. I thought that this was a nice touch. My son enjoyed playing on the equipment.5. There is a washer and dryer on every floor.6. The bed was comfortable.7. There were no roaches in our room. I was a bit alarmed when I read some reviews that talked about roaches. Luckily we did not come across any in our room.The not so good items:1. The pool has a tile bottom which is very slippery. The pool is also salt water. After the first time in the pool, we chose not to go back since we tended to ""slip and slide"" when trying to walk in the pool. Who wants to go to the pool anyway when you are that close to the beach?2. The room cound have used some updating. The furniture, carpeting, bedspread, and curtains were a bit worn and outdated.3. Most of the nicer restaurants were a bit of a walk. It seems that most of the restaurants nearby were the fast food type.4. We paid for an ocean view and were put in tower 2. If you lean over our balcony and look to the left, you can see the ocean with buildings blocking it. So much for an ocean view. It was more like city view with partial ocean view.Overall, we thought that the condo was in a great location and was a good value. We'd stay there again.Note: If you are in the area, walk a few blocks west on Kuhio and you will come across the Food Pantry. In Food Pantry, you will find Beard Pappas which makes the best cream puffs we've ever tasted. The filling is a mixture of pudding and whipped cream.

Wouldn't hurt to update the furniture but that is the only critisism. Although from Sydney, Australia booked holiday on line with Hawaiian based company (maybe that's why we got upgraded to such a great room whilst paying lowest price, gotta love that) Awesome recreation deck for kids, plenty of room and deckchairs even though busy tme around 4th July.

Maid service was fantastic -need more towels ??you got em.Elevators were not a problem, never a long wait. Front desk folks were great for answering questions. Located right on the bus lines and right near the pickup points for the big tours. Pool and hot tubs were fabulous - great place to chat and make new friends. Kitchen set up was ideal for family of four - could prepare a meal there if you wanted vs fighting the rest of the folks looking for a place to eat. Our safety at the place was never in doubt, my teenage daughters made several trips on their own to the beach - two blocks away. Lots of people always around so I didn't worry to much. Use the in room safe - you won't have to carry around all your valuables and cash all the timeHere are some things I learned - my opinion only!! - Don't rent a car, there are enough shuttles and buses close by to get you where want to be. If you booked a trip that includes an orientation breakfast - do it!! This took alot of the guessing out about what to do if you really don't have a planned agenda - we selected several 1/2 day or all day trips - they did all the driving which was great . Be carefull not to select a tour that gets back late and then have another one start the next day at the crack of dawn -spread them out if you can - we were there 10 days .Food - expensive but we went to FoodPantry, 3 blocks away,or Food Land at the Ala Moana mall - Wal Mart is two blocks north of the mall and has some basics - The mall is about a 20 minute bus ride away - $2 bucks per person and get a ransfer that is good for 3 hours. Lastly there is the always available ABC stores that seem to be on every corner - they have alot of basics but at a higher costOne thing that took me several days to figure out -on the main drag down by the beach ,if you don't want to be approached by tour peddlers, time share guys or other hawkers of stuff -walk on the beach side - the peddlers stick to the business side of the street, not to the beach sideWe did the Cirle Tour of the island -makes a big figure 8 of most of Oahu and they do all the driving - you see a lot of things plus see how things look outside of Honolulu - normal livingHike to the top of Diamond Head - but be forewarned - the hike is not a piece of cake - wear shoes not flip flops as1/2 the trail is very rocky or natural. Good view though once on topHonolulu Zoo - 2 hours max - and can help keep smaller kids entertained - nice bird exhibits, not a ton of animals though.Pearl Harbor - get up early as tickets can run out - must see place and give the survivors that might be there a big THANK YOUPolynesian Cultural Center -all day trip but great place to see many of the S Pacific island cultures - SUPER show at night!!!If you go horse riding - at Kualoa - ther is quite a bite of down time if you select the 1 hr ride- only bummer of all the toursAll in all - great place to visit and see - overall experience met or exceeded our expectations.

We stayed at the Waikiki banyan and it was a fantastic resort. They treated us all very well and for families traveling with children it's the only place to stay. I think our kids wore out the recreation deck!!! I have to admit I read some reviews online about it after we had booked and I was a little scared after some of the reviews I read... but upon arriving I was pleasantly surprised with our room. Honestly I could not say nothing bad about it. We had daily maid service (our maid was the sweetest woman) the sheet were changed regularly and the carpets were shampooed before we arrived. The view was spectacular, we had a view of the ocean and diamond head to wake up to every morning. And the best part for me was having a full kitchen to make my children breakfast and lunches every day which cut down on some of our exspenses.

The room was clean, we saw no insects at all. The only thing that could be an improvement is to have a closing door on the partially separated bedroom!

We did find the elevators to be slow the odd time. The Banyon is one block from the beach and shopping( the international market is a good place for deal hunters). We rented a Harley from Big Kahuna Rentals (Larry) and toured the island we recommmend this to any one who would like to see the island (parking at the banyon is $8 a day or $50 a week and is run by an independant company) The streets are cleaned nightly(you can go barefoot anywhere). Captain Bob's Snorkling is a great time you get to feed tropical fish in the middle of the ocean. Germaine's Luau was very entertaining and the food was great(you get 3 drink tickets with your meal we recommend that you buy the souvenier glass as you get more in it). Kobe's steakhouse was not worth the money and was our only disappointment.Limited menu high price. Our week in hawaii was a true holiday. The grocery store(the pantry) is only 4 blocks away but is more expensive than the one in the Ala Mona Mall. Beware of street venders selling cheap activities as you may not ever see them or your money again( this did not happen to us as we were warned of them).We would stay at The Banyon again.,british columbia,"luvinhawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>british columbia</strong>",4,4.0

We were in unit # 2404 (Tower 2) - didn't see any bugs by the way). Lovely unit with a great view - the kitchen was a big plus in terms of saving money on food. I have no compliants about the agency that we booked through or the room I did find that the staff at the front desk of the Banyan were abit rude and short with us. I thought this might have been because we rented the room from the agency and technically they have nothing to do with the room but I have read other reviews about the staff being unfriendly so maybe it wasn't just us. The pool area is pretty good, really crowded though I think the entire 2 weeks the least amount of people I saw in the pool was about 5 and that was on a cloudy overcast day. The internet room is good for checking your emails and printing out travel reservations etc. It is expensive though - 15 cents per minute, which really does add up when you are reading mail etc.It's true the lifts are slow but your on holidays and usually not in the biggest rush so I didn't bother me too much. The Banyan is about 3 blocks to the food pantry which is where we did most of our groccery shopping. Reasonable prices great selection.TheBUS was GREAT make sure you get yourself a timetable from your local ABC store (on every corner - failing that there on the corner after that - there are like 30 something on the island). The bus stop is just on the corner of the Banyan so its an easy walk from drop off.Overall I liked the Banyan if I went back to Hawaii I would like to stay someplace more upmarket (Hilton Hawaiian Village looks spectacular) but if you are watching your pennys this one is for you.Any questions please email me:vanilla_chick18@hotmail.com",Malua Bay,"serendipity_sunrise</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Malua Bay</strong>",44,4.0

Don't let any thoughts that they may be getting fixed fool you. When we checked in, we waited nearly 15 minutes (I timed it) for an elevator, then had to stop at nearly every floor to let people out because the thing was so backed up. On the way down, much of the same. If you use the elevator early in the morning, it isn't a problem, but that's because no one else is using it.It might not see like a big deal, but waiting that long for an elevator with 30 other hot, sweaty, impatient people gets old real fast.I wish that were the the worst thing about this hotel. Nope. The roach traps under the sink should have been my clue to leave. My little buddies started coming out right about bedtime and partied all night and into the morning.Other than the elevator and the bugs, the check-in staff was completely uninterested in their job, the beds are uncomfortable and the a/c is loud. The pool smells funny. The place isn't aweful. The room was clean except for the nasty bugs. The view from our room was better than expected. Parking for only $8 is a bargain. The check out staff was friendly. The rate was fair for the area. But I would never stay here again.

Check-in was fast becasue they had an available roolm for us. It was a 2 double-bed room with queen sofa. There were 4 adults and it was large enough for us. I guess I stayed in an older room because the air conditioner was in the lanai sliding door and it leaked to the outside. We had a really good view of the ocean and the kitchen facility was adequate, except no dishwasher. We cook all our breakfasts and one dinner. The room was large enough for us. The best part of this condo is the location. It is directly behind the Marriott resort and a 5 minute walk to the beach. Also, the parking was right there, but I didn't like having to pay for parking daily. The hotel wouldn't put parking on our bill and pay at the end. This was inconvenient! The only option was to pay every day or pay 7 days in advance - $50.00 for the week or $8.00 a day. For shopping and location this was a good place to stay, but it is an older complex with average amenities.

We stayed here for 6 nights in 1-bedroom/1-bath condo, superior city view. I booked only a standard room w/ a single queen bed but on arrival they gave us a double. The staff was good about accomdating our needs and upgraded us for free to a superior city the next morning. The new room had nice renovations to it - new kitchen cabinets, new kitchen appliances, and the view was better. Impressive. The room had a remote controlled A/C unit which is a plus, unlike some other places that don't even have A/C to speak of. The upgrade was much better than the first room, which had more dated furinshings/carpets. Open air lobby has a nice waterfall w/ coi fishes. There's even a mini-mart at Tower I.The goods:- Location, location, location. It is near the Diamonhead end of Waikiki, less busy, less noise. Beach is literally 2 blocks away.

We have been visiting Hawaii every year and have stayed in many hotels.We were there for the big earthquake on our second day but supprisingly, we faired much better than friends staying at some of the higher priced, full-service resorts. All electricly was out but 2 out of 4 elevators in each tower were running and there were periodic announcements from Security to try to reassure guests that nothing was know at the time and we were free to do as we like. We heard of others having to walk 28 flights of stairs and no announcements during this ordeal.The hotel entrance way was very nice with dark wood paneling and tasteful Hawaiian decor. On one side of the open lobby was a rock wall that had water cascading down into a Koi pond. Front counter staff were all very friendly and helpful...except the Concierge who we tried several times to contact via different methods unsuccessfully. Over the course of few days, it turned into a challenge to try to get help from the phantom Concerige. First day he was out to lunch so we made plans on our own. Then the next day we tried calling down but never got an answer, then I tried to call the front desk to ask a callback but never was contacted so finnaly I went down to directly try to get help but was told very bluntly by the person behind the concerige desk that he could not talk...too busy.The point is plan to make your own travel plans if you stay at this hotel.On the positive side, we had both a mountain and ocean view that was nice. Room was big with full kitchen and big entrance way. Note for internet users, connection to internet costs $$ but free wireless access was available from nearby with a very good connection from anywhere in the room.On the negative side, bath was Very small and the exhaust fan was Loud. We complained to the front desk that our reservations stated that there were 2 full size beds, but we were told that the second bed was the sofa bed...which was no cost! The sofa bed-frame was bent out of shape and Very bad so we had to put the Very bad mattress on the floor for a Very uncomfortable bed. There is no restaurant on the premise except a snack bar by the pool. There is a convinience store on the first floor but a full Grocery store is a good 20 minute walk away. For just about everything, we were told to go next door to the Marriott.As for location, don't be decieved, this hotel is on the edge of Waikiki and not at all central...to anything.As a conclusion, the Facility was nice for families and clean but very old.

Our check in did not go smoothly but that was the fault of our booking agent. The front desk staff was incredible, particularly Marlon, who went out of his way to make it up to us. We were in Tower II with an amazing view of the mountains and the Ala Wai Canal. Our room had two full size beds and a queen-sized sofa sleeper so we had plenty of room. The housekeeping staff did an excellent job and our room was always clean and stocked with fresh towels. The pool area was very nice with a snack bar, BBQ grills, basketball and tennis courts, a play area for younger children, two hot tubs (hot and hotter) and plenty of lounge chairs. It was always very clean and well maintained. The hotel has a nice little market on the first floor near the parking garage in Tower I and we were amazed at the prices, which were comparable (if not cheaper) than any of the other markets nearby, and they carry nearly everything you'll need for your stay. There is also a computer room equipped with computers and a printer that you can use for a nominal charge. If you bring your laptop and a wirless card you can access the internet at no charge, but you have to either be in the computer room or on the benches just in front. Our two teenagers would run down with our laptop while the rest of us were getting ready to go out and jump on-line to say hi to friends and check e-mails. We had no problems waiting for elevators, but we were there during an off-season time. The only ""negatives"" I can offer would be a lack of storage and, initially, late housekeeping. With 5 of us (2 adults and 16, 14 and 11-year old girls) we could have used a bit more storage space than a closet, a tiny 3 drawer bureau and a small night stand. We had no where to store our luggage and the bags remained out the entire stay. Also, the first two days of our stay we had returned to our room around 4:00 or 4:30 and housekeeping had not been by yet. However, I simply called housekeeping and requested an earlier visit and after that the room was always tended to by noon.Overall our stay was awesome. We have been to Hawaii several times (and even spent our honeymoon - 19 years ago - at the Prince Kuhio across the street) and the accomodations here were perfect for a family. There's plenty of shopping and dining within walking distance and the beach is only a short walk away.

Yes, they had a full service hotel, but we had a nice pool, BBQ grills, tennis on the 6th floor. Having a full kitchen was a huge benefit in keeping costs down. With parking only $8/day (reasonable for us as we come from major metro area where parking is easily $15/day) we made good use of our car.

The location is excellent five minute walk to the beach and for the price we paid for this hotel you couldn’t go wrong $200 a night for a one bedroom apartment within a few minutes form Waikiki Beach, it works out at less than $40 per person. In my opinion this is an ideal hotel for families and groups. If you wanted to be negative and pick holes you could say the carpet had some stains on it but it is a self catering apartment and a darker carpet might be more practicable.

We found the room to be a great size.

And for a normal size person its quite ok. We found everyone to be helpful and polite, the lifts were a little slow on one day out of eleven...who cares your on holidays... the room being up so high was quiet. We didnt hear a single person in other rooms at any stage. During the nights with the air conditioning on we could hardly even hear the traffic below. The bed was comfy, the kitchen well stocked with cutlery and the room cleaned every day by a lovely cleaning lady.The only thing i could fault was a $40.00US phone call back to Australia for under a minute which was made through reception.

We stayed in two rooms in Tower One. One room (the last room at the end of the hall) was larger than the other and had a nice view of Waikiki Beach. Both rooms were relatively clean - no cockroaches! Furniture is a bit dated, and carpeting in one of the rooms was worn. Air conditioning did not circulate well to the bedroom, as the unit was in the main living room. Beds/mattresses and pillows were comfortable - seem to be new. Elevators were slow and became stuck at times. The trick is to physically push the doors closed if the elevator does not move. The parking lot is not designed very well, but parking is relatively cheap ($7/24 hours, with in and out priviliges). Did not go to the pool so cannot comment on these facilities, but appears to be well maintained. Staff are friendly and helpful. Location is convenient, very close to the beach.

Overall, I would rate this hotel a good choice for families travelling with children. It is by no means a luxury hotel and is short on amenities such as a coffee shop or restaurant but by and large, we enjoyed our stay. The best features are the the separate bedroom (sliding doors but a good size and nice to have the privacy), kitchen, generous seating area with a hide-a-bed couch and two chairs.. plus a large lanai. We didn't cook at all but we could have and it was great to have a table and chairs where we could eat a light breakfast. It was also good to have a decent-sized room to come home to and relax in at the end of a long, hot day on the beach or out sightseeing. We walked around Waikiki a lot and got a look at many of the finer hotels and yes they had shops and restaurants but when we checked them out on this website before coming, you could see the rooms were lovely but not very big, unless you got a much higher-priced suite ($400 plus).After reading a review right before we left, we called and requested a renovated room on an upper floor. We got what we asked for and stayed on the 32nd floor and were very glad we did. We could see that other floors (and therefore rooms) were very much in need of upgrading. And yes, fellow travelers, the elevator was a wee bit slow and very hot but it's very hard to complain when you're in Hawaii.I'm not so sure I would stay here if it were just the two of us on a romantic holiday getaway but for 2 adults and a (large) teenaged son, it was just fine. Most Honolulu hotels, especially those in Waikiki, can't accommodate 3 adults comfortably or privately in one room and many are far more expensive than the Banyan. As one of our fellow hotel guests observed, he'd rather stay somewhere more modest and spend his money on adventures like snorkeling or sailing. Our room was cleaned daily (and no, we didn't see one insect) and we always got fresh towels. Plus, the hotel staff were helpful and tried to meet all our requests. It was also within walking distance of pretty much everything. The beach is 5 minutes away - 3 minutes if you run.Again, request a renovated room. That was the most important piece of advice we got. (p.s. if you're looking to rent a car in Honolulu, book well ahead of time. Rental cars are at an absolute premium there and we couldn't get one for 2 days after inquiring. Plus, I wouldn't bother having a car for more than 1 day and only then so you can drive around the island yourself and stop when you want.))","Alberta, Canada","AMDAlberta</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alberta, Canada</strong>",21,3.0

But before we knew it, we saw cockroaches in the kitchen AND the sofa/ living area! The front desk was not helpful and said they were working on the problem. Also, this hotel does not have a separate ""service elevator"" - so the elevators are always filled with the housekeeping carts, hotel employees, etc. Once it took over 10 minutes to get an elevator!

After our 7 night stay on the 26th floor in tower 1. I am pleased to say our stay was great. NO BUGS (dead or alive) The view was incredible. I requested a pool view & got that along with a great view of both the mountain & the ocean. This came along with the superior city view. The nights were quiet with a siren or two for that back home feel. My 11 year old daughter enjoyed the pool, although it stayed crowded most of the time and my 19year old daughter enjoyed the jacuzzi & basketball court. I enjoyed the jacuzzi, tennis court & the barbeque grill. The rec deck was nice with plenty of chairs with umbrellas. The room, in addition to a view to die for had 2 full size beds & 1 Queen size bed, along with 2 TV sets. The entire floor was newly renovated it appeared & the carpeting, fixtures & drapes were all in excellent condition. They did have roach traps discretely placed through out the room, we never saw any roaches, ants or anything else. The hotel is a short 1 block walk from the beach (less than 5 minutes) the zoo was about an 8min walk & the aquarium was about a 12 min walk. A bus stop is right outside the hotel doors & is $2 for adults & $1 for children to go ANYWHERE. Once you learn to manuver around on the bus, a rental car would be an unnecesssary expense. The kitchen was fully stocked but if you intend to bake, bring your own baking pans, as none are supplied. They supply beach towels & also have a mini golf course . The staff was very helpful & pleasant most of the time. I could not ask for anything more from a resort/condo. The price could not be beat. Excellent value. Great location. Very peaceful. The balcony is quite spacious. They exceeded our expectations.

My mom liked it enough to invest in their timeshare and exchange program. Don't go in here expecting the Sheraton, Hawaiian HIlton, or Hyatt. You're not going to be totally impressed... but it is one of the better hotels in the area. Our last visit to Waikiki Banyan was in March 2005 for my wedding. We were in Hawaii for 3 weeks in preparation and for after our wedding and spent the first week at the Banyan before moving to the Hyatt in an effort to make our wedding budget. We had guests staying in hotels all over the Waikiki area with about 15 families staying in the Banyan. The Banyan by far had better reviews by our guests than some of our other friends and family that stayed in area hotels. The rooms are clean although, the decor is a bit dated. But as long as you don't mind the silk flowers, you'll be okay. They have put in updates since our first visit, all new appliances, countertops, carpet and paint. They could have used new and more comfortable beds and bedding... but maybe they're still working on it. The view is tricky. I've stayed in rooms with the view of the golf course and the ala wai canal which is nice, a room with a great view of... the Marriott. And we've stayed in rooms with a view of the recreation deck and a peek a boo view of the ocean. We've asked to change rooms because we didn't like either the room or the view, which they have accomodated.Location, location, location. Although it is not directly on the beach, it is exactly one block from the sand and water. There are ABC stores, restaurants, and nightlife in every direction within walking distance. The international market and high end shopping are also within walking distance. Unless you're staying at one of the 5 star resorts, the Banyan has a great recreation area. The pool is better and bigger than the one at the Hyatt or the Marriott, with more beach chairs and access to tennis courts, putting green and bbq's. There are laundry facilities on each floor that are handy. There are small kitchen areas in the rooms which is kind of nice to have. I personally don't like to cook when I'm on vacation, but some people like it. The pots and pans aren't the best quality, but it get the job done, I guess. Sometimes as you're walking down the hallways, you can smell what other people are cooking. The staff was helpful everytime we went down to the front desk for directions and had convienient area maps. It is located in a safer area of Waikiki where we could spent late nights walking to and from area bars and restaurants and didn't have to walk past prostitutes and drug deals like where our relatives stayed at the Miramar with their children (our ring bearer found a bag of weed in the lobby on the floor there! YIKES!).Overall, in my opinion, I think the Banyan is a good deal with more pros than cons.","seattle, wa","rachelmadayag</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>seattle, wa</strong>",35,4.0

We did end up moving an addtional time due to room availability, but ended up with a gorgeous ocean view room on the 28th floor. As for room decor, each unit appears to differ based on ownership as some units are time shares & others are vacation rental homes - not a true hotel.The elevators are slow only at key times - due to heavy use, i.e., 7:00 am & 5:30 pm - people leaving for the morning & returning at night & leaving for dinner.Best benefit was it was a competitive price & it is so close to the beach.

(Actually originally decided to splurge this year and initially checked in to a 2-bdrm at their other property, the coveted Beach tower for 50% off rack rate which is $388 (rack is $776!) and were mortified at the poor value - see separate review of thisproperty.) So I quickly scrambled and got us a 1 bedroom at the Banyan and got the heck out.The Banyan is all about the luck of the draw regarding how your particular room is furnished and situated. Some will have slightly different layouts and newer TV's, etc. THE KEY: Don't be afraid to ask to see other available rooms.The pool area has a nice open feeling too with partial view of Diamond head where other buildings a few blocks closer to the center of Waikiki will have a more packed in feel (like the Beach Tower). This can also make the pool area a bit Breezy though.All rooms will seem dated as most all condos in Waikiki were built in the 70's and most look like they did back then - Banyan is no exception. If you can get past that, the Banyan is actually a superb value (we paid $130 Entertainment rate for a 1-bedroom [1/3 the rate we paid for a 2-bedroom at the Beach tower] which is more of a cross between a 1-bedroom and a studio as the bedroom as a slider usually and not a door. It's a small 1-bedroom.)I believe the best rooms are on the upper floors (25 and above) in Tower 1 where you either get a Diamond Head with partial ocean view or a City with partial ocean view (the units on the city side have a bit better view of the ocean but not by much - I like the Diamond Head View best.) side but I imagine the oceanside rooms in the upper floors of Tower 2 are good too.This year we got one on the City side (36th floor, 1 floor from the top in Tower 1) which actually isn't too bad. Had to switch rooms though (from 34th to 36th same unit) as we got a unit were they installed a shelf in part of the opening to the bedroom so the A/C wasn't going to cool the bedroom much.IMPORTANT: Don't plan on having much privacy in the bedroom unless you don't mind sleeping in a hot stuffy room, you need to keep the sliding doors open to get some of the A/C. Also good to get a room with the TV on a roller cart so you can roll it around to face the bed in the bedroom while the kids sleep on the sofa.Bed's are not comfortable in this place, especially if you are sensitive to this sort of thing. Prepare to invest in an inflatable cushion or egg crate foam unless sleeping on concrete or springs is okay with you. Again, it is the luck of the draw though some units may be just fine and those use to staying in places with poor beds will probably not complain.Staff here is friendly. Location is superb, 1-1/2 blocks walk to the less crowded, most protected (called ""The Pools"") section of Waikiki Beach.Elevators are only slow at peak times. 4 high-speed Internet computers near the lobby ($1/5 min.) Small convenience store also in building. No restaurant, but there are PLENTY within a very short walk.If you have a couple children and your budget is under $200/night, THIS IS THE BEST VALUE IN WAIKIKI right now (The Sunset would be a good value too as it is similar but I give the edge to the Banyan - I toured the Sunset rooms and the only advantage is that you can get a 2-bedroom/2-bath there but the pool area at the Banyan is better, especially for kids.) The keyword is VALUE not LUXURY.I actually give it a 3.5 (3 for the property itself, 4 for the value, 4 for the pool area compared to other similar properties in the category.)",,jellyb,171,4.0

Great view of Diamondhead and a bit of the ocean. Cleanliness - the shower could have been cleaned better and the dishes were not cleaned so we left a tip at the end of the trip for them to take care of. Design could have been updated - found one broken lampshade next to the bed, but it didn't bother me too much. Large TV on a rolling cart so we could watch from bed was nice. sofabed pullout was also a good touch and shows you how big the room is. Service - Found that the front desk could have been more helpful when the concierge was busy. When I called to ask the concierge for questions on street parking she said she didn't know and then got sidetracked and asked me to hold. Didn't put me on hold, but put the phone down to talk to another guest visiting her desk for 5-10 minutes before I hung up. Comparison to pricier hotel near by:We had friends staying at the Radisson across the street - although newer and had complimentary business center/internet use and a hospitality suite for showers after checkout, the rooms were by far very small, compared to ours. More expensive and the service was pretty good, especially the bell men. Bar in the lobby and by the pool were both nice.Location: at the end of the waikiki strip on Kuhio, but close to the zoo and Kapiolani Park, and walking distance to the beach.

There was everything we needed in the room and lots of space.

The bathroom was small, though, and the water pressure in the shower was not very strong. Lighting in both the living room and bedroom could have been better; primarily lamp lighting is used. The lighting wouldn't be good for reading novels. The large sliding doors to the lanai and windows in the bedroom gave a beautiful view of the Ala Wai Golf Course and residential areas beyond. We wish we had reserved an ocean view room with such large windows available. The rec area was large, with tennis courts, a small putting green, a pool, two jacuzzis, a BBQ area and snack bar. However, it's weird that you have to pay quarters into a coin slot in order for time to use the BBQ. Also, the golf clubs for the putting green should be complimentary instead of $3 per hour. The pool was scheduled to be closed for 5 days, from Sept. 26-30, but because a child threw up in the pool on Sept. 24, the pool was also closed on Sept. 25.

The hotel should have allowed us to go to their ""sister"" hotel across the street to use the pool. The front desk said they couldn't allow that for liability reasons unless we were renting a room at the ""sister"" hotel. I'm sure they must have an umbrella liability policy for all the ""sister"" hotels (or if not, they should procure one), and they should have let us use the pool at the other hotel. The elevators took forever to come, even though there were four elevators for each tower. Also, the hallways and the elevators are super hot on humid Hawaii days!! The only air conditioning is one window unit in the living room. There should also be a unit in the bedroom, so you can shut the sliding door between the two rooms and still feel the A/C coolness. All in all, it was a pretty good value for the amount paid, considering that the room is in Waikiki and the hotel is conveniently located. The front desk staff could have been friendlier upon check-in, though, and the keys didn't work the first time we tried (on the 38th floor!), so we had to wait forever again for the elevators in order to go back to the front desk to get the card keys re-keyed. That was a hassle that should never have happened.","Honolulu, HI","Pathfinder38260</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, HI</strong>",9,3.0

Our idea about this condo-hotel is changing little by little. The first time we had a very good time. Then this summer we must think about our idea. Parking a lot: This may be very pool, depending on when you are visiting. We came here late in the evening. We were tired of flying from LA. We drove to the parking a lot next to this hotel. At the entrance, a parking guy told us that you were not able to park your car although you were staying here because they had no place to accept any car at all . We wonder why we could not!! Then we got out of it, we rushed into the chech-in counter.We won`t forget what they explained to us. ``We have nothing to do with the manegement of this parking a lot. So we have no resposibility for your request.`` OH, Come on!! It took a lot of time to let them know this stupid progrom. You know, we were so weary after all. Hotel service: used to be, they were nice. But this summer, it seems to be changed. The room they gave us was completely different from what we requested. The room has no couch. Everyone can tell what this room needs.Is this room enough to make us confortable after a long flight? We asked them what it was. We could not believe what we asked for. Is it a hotel you should pay for? Someone came to us , checking out what it is. Then they came to understand it. But they said there was no room for you and you should stay there one night. We were tired of their poor service. The next morning they called us . But they did not know what is problem. We had to explan what they treated us again and again. At last, they offered the new room. But it was too late, unfortunately.In conclusion, the hotel price looks pretty reasonable. The room view would be nice , as always. But we think we should pay for this serivice although we used to enjoy staying.","Tokyo, JAPAN","FarAway2758</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, JAPAN</strong>",9,2.0

Check-in went ok, elevator ride up to the 34th floor was a nightmare as there is no ventilation in the elevator and it was like an oven! The room was well appointed but the furniture was not in tip top shape and should have been replaced. No dishwasher, no ice maker in the fridge and only 2 ice trays, no blender and none available, no broiler pan for the oven. Glassware minimal. TV ---- as you only get a handful of channels with no premium channels at ALL! Sofa was comfortable though. Nice view of the mountains. When you close the doors to separate the bedroom from the living room, the A/C window unit can't cool it so that is a problem. Also, a real negative is they close the pool and spa at 9PM what the heck is up with that? The ""laundry facilities"" consist of 1 washer and 1 dryer on each floor! No ice maker or soda machines or anything anywhere in the hotel. Mini mart on lobby level is expensive as heck, and the ATM will only dispense $100 a day. Make sure you pack food as you won't want to buy it, the prices are outrageous! Make sure you bring things like dish soap, laundry soap, etc, from home as it is 5 x more in Hawaii than on the mainland.Now, for the rest. The pool is large with lots of lounge chairs. The BBQ grills are electric and cost $2 an hour to use. The 2 spas aren't big enough to accomodate everyone who wanted to use them. One is luke warm, one is about 98 degrees, the better of the 2. You are only a 2 block walk to Waikiki Beach and this place is conveinent to all of Waikiki. The parking garage is $40 a week. parking spaces are hard to get! Since this was my first trip to Honolulu, I know now not to stay on Waikiki. It is too busy and congested and the traffic in Honolulu is horrible!

When we checked in at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night to a room on the 34th floor. I was MORTIFIED. Despite our paid upgrade to the ocean view room - we could see it if we craned our neck to the left of the lanai. The room was old, there were no pictures and it felt like a dump. I told my husband that I was going to check out other hotels the next day. I called, the staff agreed but they had nothing else available and asked us to check back the next day. The next morning we asked for another room. WOW. A clean room, new appliances, full microwave, beautiful view of Diamond Head and the Ocean on the 32nd floor. It was like a different hotel. The maid service was good but sometimes not till 5 or 6 p.m. at night. Also, coffee is only complimentary the first day... ???... I thought that was a little cheap. It was GREAT to stay here with our 4 month old, because we couldn't hear anything so we were certain no one could hear us. The microwave and full kitchen was hand for cleaning bottles, storing breastmilk, etc. Our floor mainly had permanent residents - we were one of the few tourists there. The parking was cheap, $7/day or $40/week. Pay the weekly fee if you are going to be there more than a few days just for your sanity. If not, you have to physically go down and repay every 24hours --- if you don't they'll charge you and additional $7 plus the cost of a new 24 hour ticket. The parking garage is NOT owned by the hotel. I'd stay here again - ONLY if I was guarenteed the same room or one just as nice... I'm not sure that's a gamble I am willing to take for our next visit.

Our room was modestly decorated, with two new queen beds, new linens, new carpeting and a very comfortable pull-out sofa bed. The kitchen was clean and well-equipped, and was separated from the living room by a large island and four very tall bar stools, which might be cumbersone for little people - a table and chairs would have been so much easier. Definately workable! A convenience store can be found on the Lobby level and offered a wide range of foods and souveniers as well.The nearest grocery store (food pantry) is three long blocks away and can be accessed easily by a number of buses that pass right by the Banyon.

EXCELLENT!Transportation to and from ANY ACTIVITY can be found right out the BANYON. theBUS system is $2 for adults and $1 for Seniors to ANYWHERE on the ISLAND with a free transfer of 2.5 hours. We did the Circle Island Tour (4 hrs) for $2 and had a picnic at Sunset Beach, using our transfer to get back on theBus to return home.Hotel staff were above and beyond! Housekeeping bent over backwards to serve us and the cleaniness of our room was greatly appreciated. An Activity counter at the Front desk can arrange tours with a huge supply of brochures, and can recommend sights for you to see. We booked our luau through them (Paradise Cove-exc value).A computer lounge is available to Banyon guests, requiring $9/hr to use, but we were able to easily bank our time and spend our minutes over several days. All in all... highly recommended. Corner units are more spacious and if you get the chance to upgrade to ocean view - do it! It cost us an extra $10/day for an OCEAN view (not a corner unit though) beyond our upgrade that they gave us for having a senior in our party.

It was a 5-minute walk to the beach and there were dozens of restaurants and shops within easy walking distance. The Waikiki beach area is very densely populated with high-rise condo and hotel towers everywhere so it was a little intimidating for the first day or two. By the end of the week, though, we had become thoroughly 'urbanized' and really enjoyed all of the things going on and places to go. Our teenagers loved it. The pool deck was very nice with two hot tubs, a 'warm' hot tub, and a 'hot' hot tub. There was also a tennis court but we forgot to bring tennis rackets. The front desk had a basketball, though, that we used on the hoop on the tennis court. Our condo had a view of Diamond head but not the beach but it was still pretty good. Security was good in that there were video cameras scattered around and a safe in the room (which we never bothered to use.) There does not seem to be very much, if any, crime in Waikiki though from what we saw. The sidewalks were filled with pedestrians from morning to night and we never saw any police cars or sirens or anything. Waikiki is a pretty mellow place. There is a little store on the first floor that sells the basics. For other stuff, there was a Foodland four blocks down the street on Kuhio Street that had a pretty good selection. The only complaint is that there was a $.75 charge for every call made from the telephone, even 800 and calling card calls which seems excessive. Good things we did while there: snorkeling in Hanauma Bay (get there before 8:30 am if you want to park), hike to Manoa Falls, Arizona Memorial, snorkeling in Turtle Bay, Kailua beach, and the Dole Pineapple Plantation. Bad things were the Polynesian Cultural Center (the center is great, the luau food was great, but the luau show was dull unless you like to watch pretty girls dressed in burkas) and the small Waikiki beach waves.","Redmond, Washington","jaybirds</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Redmond, Washington</strong>",41,4.0

The staff were efficient, but not particularly friendly, however, we found this to be the case almost everywhere in Waikiki. We would have preferred to stay closer to the beach, the Banyan is a 10 minute walk away, however we left Waikiki with fond memories of our stay at the Banyan.","Tasmania, Australia","Odyssey17746</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tasmania, Australia</strong>",8,4.0

The sunrises are spectacular but also sleep disturbing. Black out curtains would significantly improve the bedroom. The bedroom had sliding doors and there is only one TV on a movable cart for the whole unit. The high rise is just two blocks from the beach. Our kitchen was well equipped, even included a rice cooker, although the refrigerator had a strange smell which we eliminated with a box of baking soda. The pool was small but fun for the kids although it was generally always crowded. The mini-mart in the first floor was surprisingly cheap as far as Honolulu standards. The Astonishing Kids deal saved us a bundle (discounts at Sea Life Park, the Creation Luau and the Dole Pineapple plantation). The bathroom was small but had a separate vanity and sink. The lanai held two chairs. The air conditioning unit in the living room was strong enough to make it too chilly at times despite 90-degree temperatures. The parking attendants were great for directions and the desk staff was always helpful. We encountered a few minor problems that were quickly resolved by the staff (Missing safe key, broken TV remote control, clogged kitchen sink and sticky shower door). The rooms are well insulated, we did not hear a peep from the other rooms or the adjacent elevator shaft. The laundry facilities are limited, just one washer and dryer per floor, precluding multi loads, but it was always available when I needed it.","Chicago, IL","Diner5053</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, IL</strong>",45,4.0
