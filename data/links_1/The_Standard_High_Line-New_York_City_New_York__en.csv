Booked directly through the website and had no issues--all questions were promptly answered, etc. Bed was comfortable and loved the tub in the bathroom (Deluxe Queen). Not much sound proofing on rooms--easy to hear what was happening next door and in the hallway. Toilet was in a separate room, which was nice, but the close quarters of the room still made it slightly awkward for a romantic couple weekend. Only things we'd change is the music in the public spaces was overbearing and less-than-ideal (""Greatest Hits of the 70s and 80s"" type stuff) and the downstairs bar/coffee shop service left something to be desired--had to ask for change, difficulties getting attention of the servers, etc.",,deirdrem859,0,4.0

This was my first time not booking directly with a hotel and it did not go well. All my confirmations showed I booked a Corner Room but The Standard only had records for a regular room. I know there are worse things in life but I felt my experience at the front desk was less than desirable. I flew all the way across the country and just go out of a cab and the front desk/management really failed on an opportunity to have a customer for life. They even reviewed my Capital One confirmation and verbally acknowledged they had plenty of those rooms available. All they could do was suggest I go up to the room they provided and call Capital One. Then if I got it straightened out, I could haul all my stuff back down, talk to them again for an hour and get a new room. The Standard either does not empower their employees to assist or really does not care to help. I know the screw up is 99% on Capital One but The Standard really bamboozled an opportunity to show superior customer service.

We love the location and enjoyed daily walks in the high line park. Super close to Whitney Museum, walkable. Lots of great restaurants, stores etc and not busy like other parts of the city, yet very close to everything. Hotel is very hip and has an ice skating rink as well as a few restaurants and awesome rooftop bar. Water views from our room was from the side but the floor to ceiling widows are great.The only thing I would change about the room is the bathroom situation. There is really no privacy when showering, the bathroom has no door and there are shutters that block between the tub and sleeping area. But even with the shutters closed, if you are on the bed or basically most anywhere in the room, you can see into the shower. This was not a problem since I was with close family members. Not sure I would want to bare all in other situations.

I looked at a TON of hotels, read about a million reviews and weighed all of our options.I picked The Standard, High Line because so many of the reviews raved about the hospitality and how the Manager went out of their way to make sure guests had a memorable experience. I read glowing reviews about birthdays, weddings, honeymoons and booked the hotel based on those experiences.It was my husband's 40th birthday. We paid for a corner king suite and called the hotel a few weeks before to ask for a room on an upper level because it was a special trip and I wanted a nice room. We arrived and there was no note in the file, and they put us in a room on a lower floor. They had empty larger suites on higher floors, but they did not offer a complimentary upgrade. The Manager said that they cannot accommodate room requests, but if they would have told me that in advance, I could have chosen a different hotel. Also, the reason why you make a request weeks in advance, is so the hotel has the opportunity to accommodate in advance. I could have made a stink, complained more, etc., but it was my husband's birthday and I didn't want to ruin it even more. They moved us 2 floors up after one night, but we still were not on an upper floor. The Manager sent us a bottle of champagne to appease us, but my husband doesn't drink. They didn't even ask. My husband wanted a nice room, not a bottle of something he cannot drink. :(We constantly had issues with billing, with housekeeping and front desk staff who were nice but not knowledgeable about the property. You pay a $30 facilities fee to use the gym, for gym laundry (that they didn't tell us about on check in) and bike rentals that you are seasonal so you cannot use them (even though it was warm). The facilities fee is pretty ridiculous given that you're already paying quite a lot for the room. But The Standard Bar and Grill staff were absolutely amazing. The Grill Manager was perfection and all the waitstaff, bartenders were truly wonderful. It is a shame that the hotel staff didn't have the same level of hospitality, particularly at the high price point. I should note that we paid $500 a night for 4 nights. Thats not cheap and I had hoped that we would have gotten better service at that rate. It was disappointing.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","idealist79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",0,3.0

Olek, the bartender, was great, he made us one of the greatest Margarita ever and even show us some bartending tricks.

Everyone was very friendly, there was a lot of interaction between different groups and parties in the room, and the staff are an important part of the social experience. I highly recommend visiting the BBR to anyone visiting, but also to New Yorkers who are looking for an elevated night out. This is definitely the sort of place you would want to take a date to demonstrate that you have outstanding taste.

I can’t thank the staff enough for all the hospitality and our room upgrade for a King suite ❤  Maaaaaaaany thanks and shout-out to Lilly, our concierge and person in charge of getting us the best anniversary complements I could have asked for. She was flawless upon handling and arranging everything upfront and during our stay. She was super responsive to all requests and emails. I also owe a debt (LOL) to Sam and Ana for getting us room upgrades for such a special occasion and for such an express and friendly check-in! Mark took care of our luggage and made sure to make us comfortable all the way to (and getting inside) our room! Last but not least, Nico made sure we had a superfast and easy check-out with appropriate clarifications in connection with billing and made us super comfortable with luggage drop and storage for a few hours before we left.Would definitely recommend The Standard to friends and family, in particular to couples and parents travelling with their kids.

The drag performances and drinks under the outside heat lamps were just the kind of adult night I was looking for! I was also on a first date - why not drag them to a drag show on ice no?

However, my last visit, from 1/14-1/16 is making me reconsider the Maritime, the Gansevoort and the Dream. The simple reason is that when I entered my room late on Thursday evening, I was greeted with a giant cockroach (hard to tell scale in the picture). I was lucky enough to be able to stomp on him before he got away, but, as you might imagine, it was impossible to fall sleep, knowing his friends and family might be lurking nearby.

Our 15th floor room had amazing views of downtown NYC, Jersey City, Hoboken, Hudson River and even the Statue of a Liberty from our full floor to ceiling windows. Conveniently located right next to the High Line which is a great outdoor walking/viewing experience in the city. High end shopping and dining within walking distance. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful from the bellman, concierge, bouncers, bartenders, housekeeping etc. Any questions we had or requests they fulfilled very promptly. The hotel is located in a great location walkable to subways, restaurants, stores. The hotel itself could use some upgrades. First being the lighting in the rooms. Where the light switches were located. The bathroom, although large was not as enjoyable as it could be for its size. The toilet was in its own small room accessible through the vanity/closet area. The walk-in shower was across the entrance way with no door (the hall carpet got wet every time we showered). The tiles in the shower floor, ceiling and walls were shiny black and the lighting consisted of a very dim night light providing minimal sight while showering. Inside the shower was a huge rectangular tub too deep to sit comfortably in. (The water as not clear when I tried to fill it. Probably because no one has used it because if it’s awkward size.)The room was a modern/contemporary design but slightly worn. There was no dresser for clothes other than 3-4 small cubbies in the closet in the bathroom. The closet had a curtain because it was too small of an area for doors. There was room to hang some pieces of clothing. There was an L-shaped seating area with a table attached to the floor that had a swivel to help you get in and out of the seating area. The TV was mounted on a metal post out of the floor directly in front of the floor to ceiling window. (That could be mounted on a wall that was a full mirror). The window curtains could be closed for privacy and recommended when dressing as it is clear view from other buildings/street below. The Standard Hotel clearly gets 5 stars for location and city views. 5 stars for hotel staff. 3 stars for the price and overall decor/comfort of the room. They do need to update and possibly reconfigure the space in the room to be more user friendly and allow for unpacking of suitcases. Averaging it out- this is why I gave 4 out of 5 rating. We enjoyed our time in NYC filled with theater, dancing, food and sites. And that experience gets 5 stars.","West Islip, New York","Kt4ofus2kkkk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Islip, New York</strong>",2,4.0

A car transfer from Newark International took around 40 minutes in moderate afternoon traffic. Arrival at the hotel could be a little easier as there's no dedicated pull-up space for vehicles dropping off. There were no doormen either which was a little frustrating as we'd been travelling for several weeks and had a lot of luggage. The check-in was fast and friendly and the agent took extra time to find us a room she thought we'd like - high floor, but not too close to the rooftop club and with a shower rather than bath. I like that kind of attention to detail. I'd note the reception was quite cosy with a number of people waiting around, I presume on departure.The room was as expected - on the small side but it is New York after all. If you're travelling with a lot of luggage, be prepared to be stepping over it constantly, or book a larger room. The bed was decent but lower to the floor than I'd like and the pillows could be better. I still slept well though. The shower has a glass side to the room - some people may not like that. There's also no door to the bathroom and the WC door didn't close well. Overall, the room was quite tired and I'd consider it time for renovation - taps dripping and cupboard doors dropping.There's no iron or ironing board in the room but you can have one delivered by housekeeping. The gym on the 17th floor is open 24/7. It's a great space and early mornings I had it to myself and got to enjoy watching the sun come up. The hotel will also launder four items of clothing a day for free - you pick up a wash bag exiting the gym and it will be returned to your room later that day - those kind of unexpected things are a real difference.We had dinner one night at The Standard Grill. This was really the only real disappointment - the service was more frosty than friendly and meals somewhat average for the price. Our stay in New York was jam packed so we didn't get time to visit the rooftop bars.Overall it was a good stay and I needed to be in the Meatpacking district I'd visit again.","Sydney, Australia","Sheamus_81</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",194,4.0

Off to the side was a forest of heaters and deck chairs where people snuggled up with blankets and drank hot cocoa. Inside was a small, stylish reception area with couches and a few concierge stands at the rear. Nobody was there. But by the time I got there, out from behind the curtain emerged the front desk agent - ""The Man"" - Gianni. He kindly took my information, then when I mentioned to Gianni that my wife and I were celebrating our one-year anniversary, he was genuinely congratulatory and wasted no time making our experience as special as possible. VERY special. I didn't expect such generous accommodations, but he managed to facilitate one of the nicer rooms in the hotel for us. Thanks Gianni!Otherwise, we had technical difficulties in our room and they immediately sent an engineer who very quickly and discretely fixed the problem. The views from our room were incredible! Definitely check out the bar on the top floor too, but be sure to make a reservation (we went up to see the sunset but couldn't sit at any of the stadium seating booths because we didn't have one). All in all a fantastic stay! Even the bluetooth speaker was a nice touch, and the sound separation between rooms was good.

Unfortunately, it was quite the disappointment overall. The two things I would cite are: The room seemed a bit ‘tired,’ things seem a little old and outdated, which is quite the contrast with all the color-coded PR materials. Second, the noise from the nightclub was unbearable and I had to switch rooms in the middle of the night. I was ‘upgraded’ to this room with the understanding that the club was closed, but it was clearly not. I give credit to the gentleman on the phone who arranged the move, however, who was unfailingly polite and understanding. On the other hand, I was not originally offered anything for this huge inconvenience but after I mentioned it, I was given a breakfast credit, which was better than nothing, though I think I should have been offered something more (discount on my room? A future stay?). One more thing: The view (thanks to the ‘upgrade’) was beautiful but the windows were so dirty that everyone I sent pictures to commented on that!","New York City, New York","TerryB864</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,2.0

When we returned back late before midnight that’s when it went downhill.I booked a superior king room and was placed on the 16th floor.

Of course they were all booked and couldn’t help us other than suggesting they can bring earplugs up. Our sleep was terrible.Next morning we were shaken up by housekeeping at 9am - not a wakeup call when check-out time is 12pm.

Samantha went above and beyond and sent a bottle of wine, dog treats and a wonderful note. It was a blast !!Best decision I ever made. I even teared up a bit when I tucked myself in to the fantastic view that they had made my most important girls birthday so special .Not only will I recommend the standard to all my friends , but will returning soon as Samatha knew exactly what to do !!

Needless to say, we had a spectacular time in NYC and loved staying at The Standard - High Line. Upon arriving, we were immediately greeted by Ana, David Z and Melinda at the front desk. All of them couldn’t be more hospitable and accommodating. In particular, we arrived hours before the regular 3pm check-in and they surprisingly were able to get us into our rooms so that we could clean up and head out for the day. Talk about a great start to the vacation! Then they were even able to secure the room for our boys that were arriving the day after next. We were quite pleased with both rooms, which had great views of the city and Hudson River. The only drawback to the rooms were the showers, which were lacking in light and (um) privacy. They certainly had a euro flair, so I’d recommend asking for a shower curtain when you check-in as well as showering during daylight hours. Aside from that, we didn’t have ant issues with the rooms. The beds were comfortable and the rooms were relatively spacious for NYC. Subsequently, the rest of the hotel was hip and fun for all ages and walks of life. The ice skating rink in front of the hotel was entertaining, especially for the little ones. And the beer garden with ping pong and picnic tables was perfect for socializing. Regarding location, I am so happy we decided to stay in Chelsea/ the meatpacking district than midtown. Other than the Chelsea Market that is a block away from the hotel, the area is way less crowded and the location is perfectly situated in proximity to SoHo and lower Manhattan. Also, midtown is a quick train, bus or taxi ride away. I believe I covered all the high points.

The view does NOT disappoint, especially as the rooms have floor to ceiling windows. of course rooms are very small as its NYC. I ate at all of their restaurants. I was disappointed in their steakhouse but one was because the server was rude, she was an older Asian woman that maybe hates customers? Or trying to be the rude NYC person? odd for an expensive dining experience. The other problem I had was with dinner portion which was very small. Other than that I loved the ambiance of the room. I loved the quality of my meal. I also ate at the bistro, breakfast, and it was very good but not great. again, really awesome ambiance, a really cool place. As for the Biergarden this was also a really cool place, great ambiance, and with great employees. I loved the open air setting and laid back vibe. One great thing about this hotel is the location is close to other great restaurants. The high line is awesome in my opinion and we actually walked the full length, twice, as I had a conference at the Javits. Seems to be the new destination to live in NYC though so I feel it will get overun; already very crowded.

The hotel is located directly on the High Line and when I arrived to see the Standard sign upside down I knew I was in for a unique experience! The property is beautiful to say the least. Each restaurant at the property has its own niche from it's elevated menu items, to a German Biergarten, to roof top views at their lounge and club. The rooms here are very spacious for New York and very well appointed including a massive tv to catch up on the day; but a view of the city skyline from the floor to ceiling windows makes for some great entertainment as well. Though beautiful in every way the most memorable part of my stay was my interactions with the staff. I am not going to name names as it would be an injustice to not mention a staff member that went above and beyond, which was everyone. One super special thank you goes to Samantha the Front Office Manger who overheard my passion for the Empire State Building and upgraded me to a beautiful room on the 12th floor with a direct view! I cannot say enough great things about this staff and highly recommend you trying it out the next time you're in New York!

We had a Deluxe king room at $600 a night. The hotel has a great, young, chic vibe and I understand why people feel at home here. The location is great and you are right at the Highline. Our room on the 5th floor had Hudson River views but the design of the room was annoying. First of all why obscure the view and put a huge flat screen tv in the middle of the floor to ceiling window. It not only obscured the river view but it obscured the view from the table too. And it is so low your blankets obscured the remote control sensor since the bed is also one foot off the ground. The light in the shower was a tiny puck light very insufficient. There were no hooks to hang towels anywhere except two in the shower over the hot tub. Come on people where do we hang hand towels?? You’re forced to put them on the floor. Management has no concern for conserving water and energy by re-using towels and be a little eco friendly either. Come into the 21st century. We need to conserve resources. Please put a couple hooks up to hang towels - that’s just unacceptable. While design and form are nice, it is useless and annoying not to consider function. For those dollars, I would have expected a coffee maker in the room also. The staff were always super kind.

Now the rave…we were staying at the Standard because we were getting married in the 3rd floor event space overlooking the Hudson River (on one side) and the Highline (on the other). The space itself is FANTASTIC and has both indoor and outdoor areas which are both exceptional. We couldn’t have been happier (and luckier weather-wise) with how the event went and our “special day!” was made even more special by the Space, the Standard Highline AND the staff. So many people to mention but we’ll only discuss a few. First, ALEXANDRA REISS! Alex was our event planner at the Standard (official title is “Senior Sales Manager, Special Events “) and from the very first time we met (before even deciding on the Standard for our wedding), we knew we were in good hands. Not only did Alex understand everything we needed/wanted but she was amenable to all of our requests and had the added value of including things we hadn’t even considered to make our day even more special. Every subsequent meeting/planning session continued in this vein. Simply put, we can’t imagine our wedding going so well without her. She is an exception planner, organizer AND a wonderful person and we feel so lucky to have worked with her for one of the most momentous days in either of our lives. On the day of the event, the “Captain”, Joe, was also fantastic and made certain that all of our requests (both in advance AND day-of) were handed without a hitch (as well as the Champagne and treats set up in our suite (an unexpected upgrade!) as we prepared for the ceremony and somehow all of the gifts being taken up to our room before the end of the evening – just unexpected treatment that was most appreciated). We also were lucky enough to have Samantha as our “shadow” for the event and there wasn’t a moment all day/night (including coming to get us in the room BEFORE the ceremony) that we wanted for anything – she was, again, yet another person taking the extra effort to make the entire event special. All of our guests (including some very picky people) had a wonderful time and every single person who worked the event (from Joe, the “Captain”, to each waiter (Kristina (?) and others) to each bartender) made certain to treat every person attending (and not just us) as if they were the most important people there. AND, the food was incredible and no one went without the entire evening (we did not do a sit-down dinner but 18 passed hors d'oeuvres – 6 light, 6 heavier and 6 desserts – over several hours) – and every single one was unique, beautiful and outstanding. In short, we cannot recommend the Standard Highline (and event space) more to anyone and if you are considering a wedding or event, we HIGHLY recommend due to the quality, professionalism as well as space and staff that takes it way over the top in terms of events in NYC. Thank you to Alexandra, Joe, Samantha and ALL for the wonderful day and memory that will last a lifetime! - J & 0 - NYC","New York City, New York","JRHinNYC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",2,5.0

Definitely high on “cool factor.”TOO MANY CONS --1. Bed was only 12” off floor. Shoved flush to wall on one side, so you had to climb up from foot. Bed too low for comfortable sitting. Soft saggy mattress gave me back aches. Front Desk offered no solution. I had to put a pillow behind my back to not roll to center of our king bed.2. No place to put my CPAP by other bedside. Small night stand only held telephone. Drug small table from across room to do CPAP.3. No place to put luggage or clothes except on the table. 4. Bench by table not great for sitting. So basically no place to sit comfortably in room5 DANGEROUS -- Soaking tub/shower LOOKED great. Very deep and cool looking.BUT it’s about an 18” or more to step from bathroom into tub. No grab bar to help. Slippery tub floor makes this hazardous.6. NO PRIVACY -- The wall next to shower is a clear glass window. No curtain, so you are naked to anyone else in the room, and unless you close the blackout curtains, you are naked to the high rise across the street. While the shower glass was a bit sexy for my wife and I, it would not be good for two roommates, or mother and daughter -- or worse -- a father and daughter on a college visit. So unless you are comfortable showering in from of your roommate, don't stay here.7. NO SPACE -- Closet did offer shelves for clothes but very limited space and about 10 inches of hanging bar.8. NO TOWEL BARS, just a tiny hook.9. OVERPRICED FOR VALUE -- My bill for our 5 Night stay was $2,800 with no food billS -- just internet, room, and a few mini bar charges.10. BAD SERVICE -- We would have had more mini bar bills -- but they never restocked it — even after 3 requests, including two people coming to check the mini bar.SUMMARY -- So we paid $560 PER NIGHT for a crappy bed, dangerous tub, and the $195 I’ll pay a masseuse to fix my aching back tomorrow in Chicago.I’m not a rookie traveler at 72. I am certainly able bodied, so I did not order a handicap access room. But this 12” high bed and 18” high tub and no place to sit or store clothes makes this the WORST hotel stay in over 50 years of travel.Bill Note: Lots of younger folks might find all this stuff quirky, cool, and fun -- that is --unless they stayed on a higher floor where many reviewers complained about the noise from the public club until 2am each night. We were on the 11th floor and did NOT hear any noise.Stayed in: Superior King Room on 11th floor with city High Line view.",,SeniorBillyBob,0,1.0

The hotel is beautiful, and was close to my office, but it did feel a bit impractical as a business traveler for more than a few days. For instance, there was no dresser in my room to unpack clothes, only two short closet rods that ran perpendicular to the wall, with only about four hangers, as well as no iron or ironing board. I imagine the hotel would provide hangers and perhaps an iron and board upon request, but I'm not sure where it would have gone in the room. I'm not too keen to live out of my suitcase for more than a night or two, so something to consider if you're like me.(I realize I probably could have seen those details when looking at photos online, but I didn't think to look for it.)The bed was very comfortable, and the shower and bath were excellent. Loved the bathrobes, too, and I was delightfully surprised at how quiet the hotel (and outside) were during the night – their soundproofing for outside sounds was very good. When my neighbor used the shower or tub at night, though, it was noticeably loud (surprisingly so).

From a customer service standpoint, the front desk knew that it was our wedding. I was not expecting anything, but they could have at least written a card that said congratulations. Everything about this hotel screams "" this is New York city and we are too cool to do anything nice"". The room cost us close to $600 and it looked like it should have cost us $150. In terms of the bathroom, the lay out was the least of my concerns ( the toilet is literally a tiny closet, then there's the sink with no trash cans, then across the aisle is an open shower with no door). The bathroom amenities were absolutely minimal. The last time I saw shampoo, conditioner, and body wash attached to the shower wall was at my gym or maybe a motel 6. The products they use are a generic brand and for the money we spent I would have liked to see a luxury brand. I've stayed at Hampton Inns that gave their guest Peter Thomas Roth products. so this was a real shock. They also give you a lousy bag of 2 Q-tips and a cotton pad. The bed was fine as were the pillows. They provide you with a speaker that is chained to the wall which makes you feel like you question the clientele they are expecting. The carpet was disgusting and had stains all over it and the bathroom tub was clearly not cleaned in a very long time. I'm not sure if we had a uniquely bad experience, considering the other high reviews but if this is their "" standard"", I'd highly consider looking elsewhere for your hotel stay in NYC.","New York City, New York","Elana H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",1,2.0

Here’s some of the things that were not up to par:- no slippers, toothbrushes or kettle - these items should be supplied in-room for suite categories and above instead of having to be requested from housekeeping; that just reeks of management trying to cut costs.- ugly decor - the hotel pictures show a nice sunset pic of the Hudson River which makes the room look rather posh, but what they don’t show you is that the other half of the room is covered in cheap-ish red tiles that add a terrible contrast to the plush carpeted bed area (see attached pic).- badly planned and aging room fixtures - the open plan shower in the middle of the room is a disastrous idea; it has no door and clear glass, which makes it cold and wets the entire surrounding floor when used, and not many people appreciate being watched in plain view while they are showering, even couples. When a privacy curtain was requested, housekeeping came back with a $3 plastic shower curtain which completely ruined the look in the first place (see attached pic). Put in a door and frosted glass perhaps? As for the rest of the room, the toilet was also old and cheap looking, the sliding toilet door was broken and could not be closed completely, the basin area did not have enough space or hooks to hang towels, the curtains wouldn’t close completely which meant privacy issues especially at the shower area.- Unhelpful front desk staff - we asked for a few things during our stay; room upgrade which was an eligibility for our package booking, breakfast to be sent up to our room as my wife wasn’t feeling well, some sticky tape, and we didn’t get any of those requests fulfilled. The staff checking us in could have told us immediately if the upgradable rooms were full but he went behind to talk to his manager, which leads me to believe it was the manager’s decision not to upgrade us and not necessarily that it was full.- Budget amenities for premium rooms - our “free” breakfast had very few choices compared to what was on the paying menu, the internet was extremely slow ($20 for fast internet), and there was a ration of 2 bottles of water per day. These are very cheapskate options for a suite room.- subpar room views - the high price and selling point of the room we booked was a great view of the Hudson and the liberty statue, but both were marred by fog, rain and construction going on below. Obviously that wasn’t the fault of the hotel but it nevertheless contributed to our negative experience.Overall it was an extremely disappointing stay, especially after moving from the very excellent Baccarat hotel NY which was around the same price. If it was a $200 a night 3 or 4 star hotel it would be acceptable, but unfortunately not at this price point. I hope the management will make some good changes, but we will not be patronizing any Standard hotels in future.","Singapore, Singapore","VictorG4501</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",2,2.0

Very good location just a few minutes from the Highline which is a disused railway track turned into a boardwalk that takes you to Hudsons Yard. It's a funky hotel and the rooms are comfortable with nice beds and the best pilows we have slept on for a while. Don't bother with the expensive breakfast, instead, walk 5 mins. to Chelsea market and visit Sarabeth's bakery. There is a nightclub on the top floor so I would recommend a room on floor 11 or lower. We stayed for 4 nights and thought the rooms could do with a bit more storage space instead of the seats around a table which we never used. The lift is really funky showing 3D imagery of a montage of what looks a bit like Dante's Inferno. The lights in the lift could be brighter as it hard to see the floor buttons. They like black, the bathroom is tiled in black with black bathrobes. The separate toilet is a nice touch. Food is ok but recommend eating out either at one of the restaurants nearby or in Greenwich Village which is 10-15 mins walk.

First the housekeeping: check in was easy - I was a little early and my room was ready so I was able to go straight up. Staff were pretty friendly. My room was right near the elevator which worried me a bit but it wasn't too noisy. My view was south facing so part of the river as well as a bit of skyline and high line - very happy. The room itself is great -larger than some NYC hotels I've stayed in but not huge; furniture was cool scandi style and the bed was very comfortable. But it was very hot and I had to turn the air down very low to cool it down. All the appliances worked ok and the toiletries provided were pretty good. Of course the location is just great and since my purpose for being in Manhattan was to spend time chilling on the Highline with a book, it was perfect for me. The not so great news: the bar was booked out for private functions - not a major deal for me personally but I don't recall being advised when I booked and I think this would be a big problem for some visitors. Also no coffee machine - as I write this I am in an airport hotel near JFK: the TV doesn't work but there is a coffee machine! The lifts are pretty terrible - not calibrated at all so they were all on high floors when there was a queue of people in the lobby, slow and it didn't seem that all were working and there are only 4 I think (the up side of that is that you get more time to see the fabulous installation in the lifts so maybe the slowness is intentional once you get in one??). The hair-dryer is terrible - why do expensive hotels insist on rubbish hair-dryers when they can charge the customer if it goes missing. The Standard even has a note about a BOOK saying they will charge you if take it with you! So annoying. Finally, for a 2 night stay, there was an extra $180USD in taxes and fees not disclosed in the booking including a daily $25 facilities fee for I have no idea what since I didn't use any facilities, and a donation to something no one asked me if I wanted to make. Leaves a little bitter taste. Overall, I would say a bucket list ticked off nicely and a nice enough stay but I'm not sure I would do it again.","Sydney, Australia","LizH893</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",34,4.0

At night, you can hear everything: other rooms’ conversation, toilet flushing, shower, water at sink.....imagine that! This is no way to fix! My colleagues’ rooms, my boss’ room, all the same. It means they have to remodel floor by floor. Next. I asked for wake up call at 7:00 am, with second wake up call 10 minutes after, NEVER HAPPENED! Luckily, I woke up. There was an important meeting that morning. It taught me to never rely on hotel’s wake up call. I addressed to the front that morning and was told that the computer system crashed, which sounded like a big b*llsh*t to me. I told them that this is Standard Hotel, not Holiday Inn or Motel 6, apology seemed like flying a kite! Then, elevator lobby corridor was closed, for whatever reason!

The Standard had just opened and was the Coolest New Thing back when I lived there, and the memory of peeing in their brand-new skyline-view bathroom of the bar was something I always treasured. I also thought being next to the High Line would be a fun thing for a kid, so instead of waiting for the very last minute to see what hotel was cheapest day-of, I booked a room at The Standard earlier on and really looked forward to staying there.I am a person who hates spending money but who loves nice hotels, and I was totally prepared to be disappointed but honestly, this was a wonderful experience. We were checked in by the lovely Gihan (guessing, hope I'm not ruining his name), who made sure we were in a room with a bathtub, which I think we initially were not. This is what made the trip because the bathtub was the most exciting aspect of our room, both for me and my kid (besides being right next to the ice machine, which was also very exciting for both of us).I cannot say enough about how great all the staff at The Standard were. Everyone we came into contact with, from Gihan (?) to the woman working in the gift shop to the housekeeping staff we saw in the hallway to the hostess gently denying us access to The Top of the Standard to Melissa, who checked us out, was so nice in that great-service New York City way that is not annoying or over-the-top but just so personable and comfortable and great.The only major disappointment of my stay is that children are not, in fact, admitted to the bar on the eighteenth floor, which was just so sad because I had this whole involved fantasy of buying my daughter a Shirley Temple and myself a Manhattan while we marveled at that incredible huge orange light thing and those views. However, I am aware that I definitely would not want any children around me if I were getting a drink there without one, so I actually think it is a good rule and they should stick to it. I'm not mad... maybe just a little sad.I had been kind of anxious after reading reviews here, even though it was a Sunday night, that there might be noise from the rooftop bar because the night before we had been kept up by blaring music until 2am while staying at a friend's house in Brooklyn. However, the night we spent on the 12th floor was probably the most quiet and restful I've ever had in New York. The bed was great, the bathtub was great, the room was spacious by Manhattan hotel standards and comfortable for having a friend over for a drink.In short, I had a great stay that surpassed my expectations. I have probably ruined my kid forever because now she thinks that's what staying in a hotel is like, but dozing in that ridiculously comfortable bed all morning while she watched Sponge Bob and we ate Amy's Bread chocolate-sourdough twists from the nearby Chelsea Market was honestly the highlight of our trip.",,rosamundvincy,0,4.0

Everything was fine on first impressions.... but when you want to rest....I was on the 15th floor, but the daytime noise rising from the outdoor Biergarten is really excessive. Then come night time, the bass noise of the top floor club is insanely loud and annoying for anyone sensitive to noise. Then to top it all off, the couple in the room next door sounded like they were recreating the famous window scene from the film ‘Shame’. The walls were so wafer thin it was borderline distressing.... at least someone was having a good time. The bar on the top floor was better then I thought. Once past the rude security guy on the door I found the bar staff exceptionally nice and warmed as the night went on. Expensive but the view is incredible. I left thinking the Standard is a bar and club that happens to have rooms as the needs of guests are underwhelming served. I had to wait over 20 minutes to get my stored luggage back.

This was my first trip to NYC and I knew I had to had to stay at this hotel so very badly. I was lucky enough to get a room. I arrived before checkin time after a 6 hour flight delay and wanted into a room very badly, but I also knew they had different floor plans and I had a specific on that I wanted. MELINDA at the front desk was AMAZING!! She got me into one room, but it had a divider installed, which I didn't want, so I went back down and asked or another room, felt bad already. I told her I wanted one without the divider. I waited for a short time, got food and coffee inside the cafe, then was shown to another room, which had no divider from the tub and room, but didn't have the kick ass l shaped couch that I wanted. I knew I WAS BEING A MONSTER, but I called back down and told MELINDA that this wasn't exactly right either. I then had no problem waiting while they stored my luggage and cleaned the floorplan of a room we wanted and she was just amazing and such good customer service. She even left us a nice complimentary bottle of wine. Sweet as Pie!! I can not stress enough how cool this hotel is, probs not for kids. and swanky. The room itself felt a very minimal beat up, as I'm sure people party in these rooms.The only 2 issues I had with the hotel were as follows: HOUSE KEEPING - they took my hair turban by mistake thinking it was a towel and it was never to be seen again. Lost and Found couldn't find it and they thought it got sent to their cleaning company and never came back. The other thing was GLASSES, which I still keep calling to check in on, because I KNOW they are probably still behind the bed. I fall asleep with my glasses on all the time and they always end up behind the head of the bed on the floor and in some crevice that house keeping just isn't seeing. The staff never called me back about any of these things and didn't offer anything to assist of their loses. I only think this bad, considering the brand should be trying harder to assist their guests in situations like this.","Los Angeles, California","HACain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",0,4.0

I’ve been staying in hotels every night for the last 18 months and I’ve seen it all. Overall my experiences are great, in fact I can’t remember a bad experience in the last 6 months and most have been excellent to exceptional.I made a reservation through Expedia for The Standard Highline. I arrived and began checking in. Provided a passport and a Visa card. After taking an authorising for $400 (room charge was $200, I assume an additional $200 for incidentals), they realised I was using a temporarily issued Visa card. I lost my card a short time ago and await a permanent replacement. They then refused to continue check in despite having already taken $400. What difference is a temporary card? As long as it works right! It gets better. After saying it was there policy (which they couldn’t produce) to not accept a temporarily issued Visa card, they then said they could, if I rebooked directly with the hotel at an extra charge of $80 per night! Throughout this 3 hour experience in the reception in front of other guests I was spoken to like a second class citizen. When I finally decided to go to another hotel, they could even work out how to reverse the Visa card hold and said they’d send a screenshot which was never received.

Everyone else there is trying very hard to be fabulous.Minuses:There is no public area to relax outside of your room other than the 12 chairs in reception or one of the bars, where you pay to sit;Staff with attitude - the reception staff take the prize here - there is apparently no extra charge for the attitude;The building is old, the furniture and carpet in the rooms is older. Everything needs a refresh;The place is dirty: the bed, like a futon, for some mysterious reason sits almost on the floor, and it’s apparently impossible to clean under the bed. Don’t Look Under the Bed! If you lose something, sacrifice it. You don’t want to look under the bed. And, then there is the air conditioning. Either the air intake is attached to the sewer or the air conditioner has not been cleaned since the place was built. It was almost more pleasant to sweat in the close, stale air in the room than to suffer the fetid aroma of the air conditioner.Finally, the music, having been allocated a room on the 13th floor, I didn’t need a personal travel speaker. Even with the hotel-supplied earplugs - how thoughtful - the bass beat from the speakers at the outdoor club on level 18 of the hotel could be heard with amazing fidelity each night until the club closed at 4 am THROUGH THE EARPLUGS. I assume most of the guests here don’t want to sleep. Otherwise, why would they stay in a hotel with an open air club on the roof with a license until 4 am? Clearly the club’s revenue is more important to the hotel’s management than their guests’ ability to sleep.Oh, and the guest internet, is it not possible with available technology to log guests into the guest wifi for the duration of their extended stay without forcing them to log in daily?

It's not ""very good"" (4-stars) for the price paid and service provided, but it's a bit above ""average"" (3-stars).I'll start with the positives:Location! Near excellent restaurants, bars, and of course the high line. It has a real neighborhood feel. The views! Spectacular view of the downtown skyline and river in our Queen Deluxe Room and in the gym. Trendy/chic vibe. Really incredible bath products and towels/robes. Bike rentals. This is awesome when you're so close to great bike paths. Gym was good, but it could be better taken care of, and some of the equipment was broken.The negatives:Service. Staff didn't seem to care if we were pleased or taken care of. We were celebrating our anniversary, and we let them know when booking. No congratulations. No chocolate or note in the room, as many other 3.5 and 4-star hotels do. The staff seemed bothered every time we had a question or an issue to resolve. Service was nowhere near what a 4 star hotel should be in New York City. There was one front desk staff who was helpful. The others were less so.The bed. The bed in our first room was full-on broken. The coils were poking us. The guest services staff on the phone resolved the issue by moving us to another room. The front desk directed us there, but it seemed puzzling the front desk can't assist by talking with guest services. We switched rooms, and the bed was much improved. But for a 2-night stay, this is a big issue. It shows a lack of attention to detail that we saw everywhere. Tables were scratched up. Furniture was scuffed. Things needed to be painted and repaired in various places, including in the gym. We also realized after we switched that the A/C was not working properly in the first room. It was much cooler and more to our liking in the second room.Value. It's overpriced for what it is. I get that you're paying for the view and the location and the coolness factor.

Not only is it located in awesome area, there are plenty of bar and restaurant options on site of the Standard. While it is true that the bar on the top floor is open till 3:30 am, you really do not hear the music unless you are in the upper levels. I am a heavy sleeper and had no problem falling asleep at any point during my two stays. The rooms themselves are very modern with floor to ceiling windows. I would recommend staying with a view of the river rather than the city, but that could be personal preference. Besides the amenities of the hotel, what really sets the Standard apart, is the service. Both times that I have visited, Melinda Santiago was at the front desk while checking in, and she couldn't be more helpful or accommodating. Service like she provides keeps me coming back!

My review is more about how the hotel and Meatpacking has changed since I left. The room was exactly what I expected, small, modern (if not a bit worn) with a river and downtown view. The new Whitney is a bit of an eyesore, but only a block away, is a nice option for an afternoon. The gym is amazing; it has panoramic views and the best part for me were the Peloton bikes. I did have a genial but confusing conversation with the concierge about the Top of the Standard and Le Bain. Basically, you need a reservation to get in, but they stop taking reservations after like 21h30 and then after that, it's ""members only"" and even if you're a hotel guest you still have to wait in line and are at the mercy of the doormen (translated: there is no guarantee you'll get in so be prepared to stand there and wait and have a Plan B that night). All that drama just to have a nightcap or dance a bit late night. They explained these two are now separate from the hotel and the hotel does not control the policies. Again, as someone who has lived in NY, it seems like a lot to go thru to have a drink, so if you're looking these kind of options, there are plenty around outside of the hotel. I probably would just take a walk north, south or east a few blocks and you will save yourself a few headaches and euros (or dollars, pounds). Another example, the breakfast in the hotel is outrageously expensive ($20-30). If you go out of the hotel and walk one block south, you'll see a little diner called Hector's. It's been there since 1949 and it is an authentic piece of the neighborhood. In this diner, you can have eggs, bacon and toast for around $12. Google it and there is an NYTimes article about them from a few years ago if you want more info. It's a NYC diner, so there are a lot more options and fair warning; if you are particular about your breakfast (as I can be some mornings) and want avocado toast and something IG worthy, then this is not your place.","Paris, France","lhusseini</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",46,4.0

They have some artsy film playing constantly in the elevators with naked people in suggestive poses. It’s like a loop that just keeps showing the same weird stuff over and over again. The room itself had had strange magazines, one of which was supposedly a children’s issue. My husband opened it to see what it was like and there were cartoons of dogs copulating in it. I suppose these magazines and films were supposed to be “art” but we found them repulsive. We couldn’t wait to get out of there. It was very disturbing.

I’m a freelance makeup artist and am always in hotels such as the standard taking clients monthly. I’ve always enjoyed working at the standard so for this specific staycation I thought what better place to stay then the standard high line. When calling to book my stay over the phone I did have to wait quite a while to reach reservations to finally speak to someone. I assumed they must be busy. When I finally got to speak to someone I was a little sad to hear the tone in his voice (I didn’t get his name) seem annoyed and bothered by having to help me book my stay. I explained to him I wanted to call and try to request a room with a Freestanding bath tub as the front desk person had assured me that many rooms were still available and it should be a problem. He immediately talked over me stating that he cannot promise a room with a freestanding tub unless I wanted to pay for the king corner rooms. I wasn’t opposed to it but didn’t understand why it would be so much trouble to accommodate me if their were so many open rooms still available. I explained again to him I’d really like a room with a tub as it was just for one night stay and he continued to cut me off and tell me I could not be promised a freestanding tub unless I paid more. So then upon reflection of price differences of the rooms he attempted to try and charge me more then what the prices listed online had been advertised for the room I originally wanted and for the room he was trying to up sale to me. I couldn’t honestly speak with him anymore out of frustration with his tone so I asked to speak to a manager otherwise I was about to book a different hotel. I was then transferred to my saving grace Sam. This hotel establishment should thank her for how amazing at customer care she is. She was able to listen to me and help me as efficiently and effectively as possible. She was in fact so nice to me that I ended up paying the extra to upgrade to the corner room just because she was so kind about trying to accommodate my stay. She understood that I too was in the service industry and valued my business with the hotel as it’s not something I’m always able to do for myself. I will for sure be staying with the hotel again. As per my stay goes, the room was beautiful. The view from the windows of the river and the city were gorgeous. I loved the open floor plan. I have never taken a more luxurious bath then while during this stay. I look forward to staying with the standard high line again and would also love to stay soon at their east Villige location.

As one jogs from afar on the High Line towards The Standard, in the right sunlight you are treated to an image of the building that resembles a standing, almost fully opened, glass hinge , somewhat of an architectural phenomenon. The soul of The Standard is hinged to the sheets of glass stacked 18 stories high which drape the exterior and afford guests with spectacular views of the Hudson River and associated cityscape from almost every point in the hotel. This hotel kisses the earth in a unique way as it is propped up on concrete stilts creating a bridge over the High Line...another engineering wonder associated with the building. Popular with the in-crowd and the out-crowd for that matter, The Standard encompasses a bevy of busting dining-and-drinking venues very appealing to locals and tourists alike. Because it skirts the High Line, many Park events and participants use The Standard as a check point (Think: good for business). The most dramatic, physical, interior, asset is the floor-to-ceiling windows everywhere (just the backside of the outside) which permit killer views of the real thing, NYC (no virtual reality here).When you hunker down in your room you will be welcomed by wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling windows which illuminate the room dramatically with natural light and let you cash in on those spectacular vistas again. Rooms are compact (not unusual for NYC) with a white and beige colour palette, much like you would find in a cruise ship cabin. An exciting feature of selected rooms is the exposed peek-a-boo tub: peek is near the window for a revealing view while boo: is asking for a shower curtain for privacy. Remember, don't streak naked around your room, someone may be watching. And when it comes time to hit-the-hay you can gaze out of your window wall and count NYC skyscrapers until you fall asleep ( give the sheep a night off).Although the Meatpacking District is known for its hip nightlife and fine dining eateries, The Standard has these facilities right on its front porch. The Standard Grill, a classic-bistro type setting, ushers out American cuisine, is busy X 2. The innovative menu is meat heavy with entree's such as dry-aged ribs, pork chops, the old standby: burgers, steaks amongst others. It has a unique tile floor constructed of pennies, almost 1/2 M of them (this is surely a big wishing well). Another eating option is the Grill Cafe with an extensive menu and sidewalk seating which is a favourite with the summertime guests. On the 18th floor is a bar called: Le Bain, with a plunge pool and roof terrace, again with more views. Then there is the Top of the Standard Lounge. Pretty eccentric, for the rich and famous although sometimes regular folks get in: who knows maybe you can rub shoulders with NYC a-listers and celebs. If you just want to hang out, then the lobby Living Room will do just fine with its groovy lay back area, tasty nibbles and handcrafted drinks. For beer lovers, The German-inspired Biergarten is stocked with taps of European beer (some domestic also) served up in huge mugs with giant pretzels all more suitable for consumption by the The Hulk. If you are sober enough, you can play ping pong.Guests can get pumped up in the spacious 24 hour state-of-the-art gym. while their eyes feast on more panoramic vistas. The Standard has a beefed up concierge team, dubbed ""travel consultants"".This is not butler service , but it is getting close.So in NYC, if you fancy a view from any point, relish lavish and modern digs, and appreciate the advantage of fine dining tucked inside the hotel.....try The StandardHigh Line.................A Hotel With A View.","Ottawa, Canada","Room-in-my-suitcase</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",122,4.0

The Standard Queen was a small but expertly-designed room, so although there wasn't much open space, I had everything I needed. There was a comfortable booth-style L-shaped bench with a large table that was perfect for getting some work done and then relaxing with a glass of wine and some room service later in the evening. The deep bathtub has a glass wall in it, providing clear views of the rest of the room and whatever happened to be outside my giant floor-to-ceiling window. I suspect the glass is intended to be a sexy detail for romantic overnights, but whatever, I used it to watch trashy TV from the bathtub. The details were lovely - the beds were comfortable, the robes were luxurious, the toiletries were Davines (smelled so good I showered twice during an overnight stay), and the room service/mini bar options were spot on. I was so relaxed after room service and a trashy TV bath that I was ready to fall asleep at a totally reasonable hour (rare for me).BUT the club a few floors up had different plans. My first room was on the 14th floor, and Le Bain is on the 18th floor. Notwithstanding the three floors of space between me and the DJ, I could physically feel the beat from the driving dance music as I attempted to doze off to sleep. Meanwhile, the rest of the music and the voices of its loud patrons ricocheted off of the glass building just north of the Standard in such a way that it seemed like it was all happening right outside my window. Le Bain is fun. I like Le Bain. People should be loud and get drunk up there; however, it's not a great place to sleep beneath. Although the hotel provided complimentary ear plugs, I couldn't drown out the noise. This was a huge bummer since I was there for work and had a meeting early the next morning.But, the staff saved the day. I called the front desk and they immediately moved me to a corner suite on a much lower floor without so much as a question asked. Within five minutes, new keys were delivered to my door by a staff member who helped me move all of my things to the new room. I finally fell asleep and woke up to sunny views of the Empire State Building and the new and interesting skyscrapers springing up along the skyline. The new room was fantastic - big, separate deep tub inside a fully tiled bathing area with a rainfall shower head nearby. The room had ample space for walking around and peeking into the office buildings nearby (the Samsung building is really cool). Checkout was easy.TL;DR next time I stay here, I'll make sure it's a weekend so I can be the one at Le Bain who is keeping all the other guests awake.",,RuthsMom,0,3.0

The German beer garden is a little anomalous but nevertheless good fun while the bar, restaurants and gym were all very cool. The brunch was particularly good. The gym is up on the 17th floor and has its cardio machines lined along the floor to ceiling windows which is a little disconcerting for people like me with a fear of heights as it feels like you are running/cycling/skiing out towards the edge. As we were warned, the rooms are quite small but well designed to make the most of the space.

The first person we encountered was Samantha Yang who checked us in. She set the tone right away that we were in for a great week. Sam was professional, personal, and kind - and she even found us an upgraded room for a great rate. All the staff were friendly and supportive. Rooms are clean and for the most part quiet. The gym is open 24 hours and has two Peloton bikes (supports both kinds of cleats plus loops for casual cyclers)! Cool. Restaurants there were great (not the 'it's good for hotel food' excuse; these are actually great places to eat)--. It's a high end quirky place with a wink and a sense of humor. There was a 'pool' area in front of the lobby--. There is actually no pool at all, but everything else is--reclining beach loungers, umbrellas, blue astroturf (to simulate the pool), a bar with tropical drinks, a bocci ball setup with a shark fin in the sand- They pull it off and do it well. While riding the elevators you enjoy this amazing movie collage depicting a montage of 300 films put together. It was very cool -- there is a beautiful classical orchestral piece that plays along with it---- it runs in one continuous loop, however, and after 5 days of hearing it my wife and I joked that the tune starts to show up in your dreams (small quibble really, more of a joke, ). Would be nice to have different music rotated in--but I'm sure the artist would have to give permission. Rooftop bar was amazing--the view of the city is simply spectacular. Think of a party from 'The Great Gatsby' but without the snobbery and you are getting close. Live music, great drinks, fun atmosphere. Just a note that when meeting people up there that there is another rooftop establishment there called Le Bain. It is a cool rooftop hangout as well - but you have to use a separate elevator at the street level to get into to either place. The Standard's Rooftop bar and Le Bain share different parts of the same roof - and even though they connect to one another through a set of double doors (where you can see and hear each venue), you are nonetheless directed back to the street level into the proper elevator to come right back up to get into either place. Just know where you're meeting so you choose the right elevator entrance. You are close to great restaurants, Chelsea market, the Whitney Museum, and of course, the High Line walking area which runs right through the Hotel. This is an absolute do-over. You will have no regrets :)","Los Angeles, California","sofachange</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,5.0

Back then, the “attitude” given off by the staff made the stay very unpleasant. We did not feel welcomed at all, and the guest experience was not a priority for the hotel. It was too busy being focused on being to cool to make any effort at hospitality.  Fast forward 8 years, and our 3 night stay was the most delightful hotel experience we’ve had in a long time. In the past six months, I stayed at a dozen four- and five-star hotels. The Standard was among the very best. From great bathroom products and daily bottles water to staff who are concerned and dedicated to providing the best possible hotel experience. The fitness gym is well appointed and offers free laundry of work-out gear. The front desk and housekeeping staff were all very friendly and helpful. The bars and restaurants were delightful and did not make us feel like we were unwanted or not “cool” enough to dine or have drinks there. In fact, they made a concerted effort to go above and beyond customer service expectations.

I had always stayed on lower floors before but didn’t realize I needed to request this. They SHOULD NOT book the rooms below the club unless they offer these rooms at a discount and with full transparency about this. It is likely that people who are at the club and up till 4 am by choice are happy to stay in them. I AM NOT. When I asked if I could move rooms, I was informed the hotel was full.

I actually thought he was joking - no apology was made and no effort was made to compensate for his mistake in telling me this. After getting to my room I called down to double check and make sure there were no other rooms available - there were no other rooms. When asked if I could pay to upgrade they ask to call me back - fine. The front desk never called back and could even when I offered to pay extra. I called back down to the front desk and was told no one was aware of my call. I then had drinks / food at the top of the standard / boom boom room. The experience started off lovely until our waiter disappeared for about 45 minutes and no person would assist. I had to get up and go to the bar to ask for the check and take the check back to the bar to close out. When the waiter returned he said he had ""been on break"" and didn't seem think it was important that we were taken care of while away (shocking after spending $600 on drinks / food). When I told the front desk they told me any complaints would be made the hostess at the restaurant as they ""have nothing to do with the top of the standard"" - all I was looking for was an I'm sorry for your experience"".

On the positive side, the architectural concept is unlike anything I've ever experienced, and the floor to ceiling windows in the rooms make for a spectacular view. The service was excellent all around and the Standard Grill, the Grill Cafe, the Standard Biergarten, and the Top of the Standard were all first-rate. On the negative side, my room was surprisingly small and spartan for the price, reminded me very much of a ship cabin, and was a bit worn around the edges (loose wood trim on the wall, loose carpet on the floor). There was very little storage or closet space. I get that they're going for an edgy vibe, but I can see that it would be a bit much for some. Be ready for sunlight in your room in the morning, no matter what you do -- the same windows that allow for such a great view do not have light blocking drapes. I was particularly frustrated that information available from the hotel about layout, services, and amenities is VERY minimal, both online and in the room. There was no guide to the hotel in the room or on TV except for the room service menu, so I had to call or go downstairs for information. Now that I'm more familiar with the hotel through some trial and error, I would give it a go again, but would seriously consider a splurge for a larger room.

There are some excellent restaurants and shops in walking distance. The rooms are a fun design - floor to ceiling windows make rooms appear more spacious than they are - and some wonderful views. BUT...Do not stay here on Friday and Saturday nights. Unless of course you don't mind the bass sound shaking your bed until 4am from the club within the hotel. I get it - the hotel attracts a young, hip crowd. BUT - if you are going to have a club utilizing the sound system that you do, DO NOT have a hotel below it. From my understanding, a hotel is to rest, refresh...this did not happen during my stay. The hotel provides ear plugs (warning sign number one) - which are completely useless for the noise that is generated. In addition - do not expect a solution, be able to check out etc from hotel if have pre paid. The hotel team must have heard this a hundred times, so brush you off.

The front desk staff (eszter comes to mind, but they're all very welcoming) whisks you painlessly through the paperwork and either you can take their seriously postmodern elevator (you'll know what I mean when you get inside) to your room or stop at the outdoor cafe for a Martini (my preference). You know, these places always want you to mention staff members by name but at age 75, I can't, sorry. I can tell you that there is not a more welcoming, warm and efficient staff in any hotel in the U.S. (and forget Europe altogether).  We liked the Standard Grill so much, we returned the next evening and (seriously) one by one, every staff member came over and thanked us for returning. Oh, I must mention, the food is excellent and the prices are reasonable. When it comes to prices, always remember the phrase ""I am in Manhattan. I will not expect a bargain."" If you want to stay in some air bnb and wash your hands after touching the doorknob, that's your business. My wife and I come to NY every two years for the Whitney Biennial which is around the corner. 2019 was disappointing but a day at MOMA made up for it. Try to go outside for the HighLine. New Yorkers are justifiably proud of it Oh, BTW, your room at the Standard will be as clean as a surgical suite in a hospital and have more amenities than you'll ever use. They've got an excellent gym and a great nightclub on the roof if you happen to be a thirty something. I'm not and exited ASAP but the crowd is seriously fun to watch. Those heels, that pervasive insecurity. Makes me definitely NOT want to be young again.Only one complaint: please get inroom coffee makers. I'm too parsimonious to order a cup of coffee from room service (plenty of coffeeshops nearby) but to be able to make cup on arising would make everything perfectGo ahead.

After a four-year hiatus from NYC, I came back for work and was reminded about why it's such a magical city. Staying at The Standard was a great book end to each day for my 3 night trip. While the rooms are definitely on the pricey end, and the hotel can sometimes feel like it's a bit overrun by folks clamoring to indulge at one of its many fine bars/restaurants - these seem like reasonable trade offs for its prime location + views.PROs:- Quick/efficient check in & out - staff was prepared (Thanks Samantha Yang for making it easy!)- Several restaurants and bars located on premise to fit any mood (quiet drink in or party out).- Literally atop the High Line providing easy access to Chelsea Market and lots of other fun spots in the Meatpacking District- Walking distance to several other bars/restaurants if you want to venture out of the hotel- 5 min walk to the 14th St station for quick access to the rest of the city.- Spectacular views looking west.CONS:- In the evening, the hotel draws a lot of outside partygoers (who are headed to its well-known bars) which can create a bit of traffic in the lobby and congestion at the lifts.FYI:- In some rooms (or least mine and my friend's), the divide between the shower and the bed is just a glass partition.

If your looking for a different scene with a bit of quirkinesses then this place is for you. I definitely recommend this space for a weekend getaway, as the rooms are intimate. Keep in mind that this is New York, room size will be comfortable- including the closet space. As far as amenities, everything is in the room, Including a bluetooth speaker. If your not looking to step out of your room to purchase snacks and beverages they are actually placed in cabinets for your convenience. I got so caught up with the room style that during the night I realized the beds are low rise (touching the floor).This is actually great , I was able to fall asleep to a great view of Manhattan( depending on the room type of course). The one thing I absolutely adored the most was the oversized bathtub next to floor to ceiling windows with the view of Manhattan. It absolutely makes a difference for a relaxing stay. I went ahead and brought a bath-bomb to top it all off! The hotel does have a restaurant on site and a club (so keep that in mind if you don’t mind music on the last floor). But overall this place by far has caught my heart ♥️ . Guest service is always super friendly. But shout out to Ryan in reservations for being such a superstar. He might have not been behind the desk at check in, but he had the same hospitality over the phone by going above and beyond.

There was no iron or ironing board in the room and the full length window lets a LOT of light in the morning. Frankly the standard king room is average and not memorable other than the view. The Top of The Standard and the Standard Grill are the showpieces of the hotel with great views and service.

Same for the closed bar (which is a big part why we used to like this hotel). On top of everything, they were doing maintenance on the windows, so we were asked to keep our curtains closed to avoid having someone peeking in your room. Seriously? So no restaurants, patios, rooftop bar and no view... what’s the point?!? And as a special surprise, the phone started beeping at 4 in the morning for 3 hours straight, just because it was broken.

You can easily start at the bottom of the Highline and take the incredibly beautiful walk up to the other end getting a unique view of the city including Hudson Yards.As far as the hotel goes, it's easy to find and there are employees out front to assist you with luggage. Check in is fairly quick and friendly given the tight quarters in the lobby if there is a rush. We used the valet parking at $65/day to smooth out logistics. They do require at least half an hour to retrieve your car when the time comes.The rooms make the most out of the small amount of square footage and the wall of glass makes it feel larger. The shower is separated from the bed by a glass wall so any pretense of modesty would not work here. If you choose to leave the curtains open, the world can observe it all. It is also interesting that you must step over the high wall of the tub to get in.

I’m a regular at chiltern firehouse in London so I know the standard of service at his properties.However, from the moment I checked in, I should have realised that I was going to be in for a disappointing experience. Check in took more than 10 minutes with this lady who didn’t seem to know what was going on with her computer system. And that was after I had to wait for a couple checking in before me for another 10 mins!The people at reception looked like they were college kids doing part time jobs. They didn’t look smart/chic/sharp. They looks messy and dowdy. I can’t believe that one guy’s necktie was actually facing the other way and his shirt was untucked like someone who’s about to go to his first day in school.The interior of the building and the room was more like the style of the dated hotels within the Morgans Hotel group.The menu for in-room dining was sub par.I could hear water running through the pipes in my bathroom every time the room next to me turned on their taps so this woke me up regularly. I can hear whenever things were getting knocked over in the next room.I wasn’t feeling very well (little did I know it was the initial symptoms of gastroenteritis) and when I asked guest services if they can get me some paracetamol/Imodium, the answer I received was I had to go down myself to buy the medicine because of NY regulations. No apologies, no sympathy. If this is really what NY regulations say, it’s fine, I accept it but there’s always a way to say no to a hotel guest especially when the hotel guest is already ill. When I went down, I spoke to the concierge about this and told them I’m disappointed that they couldn’t help out a guest who was ill and can barely walk, the concierge then gave me a conflicting answer and said they can buy me medicine but I’d have to pay $20 service charge. Eventually I spoke to the manager about this and she confirmed that the concierge was incorrect—they indeed aren’t able to buy medicine for guests due to NY regulations.I only got a pot of tea as an apology for this screw up.On my last day I was in real pain that I asked the hotel whether they had an in house medical officer and the guy from guest services on the phone didn’t seem to know if they had one so he had to put me on hold and eventually told me that his colleagues told him they have a doctor on call for $500 for in room visits. My friend also stayed at the hotel at the same time as I did. We both extended our stay for one more night given that our flights back to London weren’t until late in the evening so we thought it would be good to have a room to go back to and freshen up before the flight. I was able to extend my room without any problems. Whereas she had to run around just to extend her room. She was asked to call at a certain time then asked again to call at another time, then she was asked to go down and show her ID. They also forgot to clean her room so she had to stand there watching housekeeping clean her room when all she wanted was to relax and get ready for her flight. They also charged her $60 for something from the mini bar which she didn’t have.Also the hotel didn’t feel special at all. The lifts are always busy, full of people waiting at the lobby. This ain’t a place you want to stay in if you want to stay somewhere special in NY. If you want just a step above the holiday inn, then maybe this is the place for you.The only one good thing was the guy outside the hotel who helps guests with their baggage and hail cabs/uber. He was very smart and alert and very helpful. I should have gotten his name and posted it here as maybe he’s the only who deserves a promotion. To the management of the hotel: He was working at 6pm on 24 March 2019, in case you want to give him some credit.","London, United Kingdom","Londohn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,1.0

The clients were so impressed by the rooms, the great amenities, and how friendly and helpful the staff was. Also, the Empire Suite was amazing - the views were picture perfect New York City, the room was beautiful and very trendy, and the bed was so comfortable. The Standard is also in a fantastic location, right on the High Line, has a hip rooftop bar, fun biergarten, and great grill for a delicious breakfast. If you decide to leave the hotel and check out the neighborhood, it's an easy walk to many fun restaurants and shops.

They first had their engineers to look at it, but said it was ""unfixable"". Then they handled it professionally and offered me another room.

My room was bigger than I had expected (but still NYC-small) and had all comforts including Netflix, good amenities, fast wifi, very well-stocked minibar. When I ordered room service and when I ordered foam pillows, the knock on the door seemed almost immediate.As others have said, there is only clear glass between the shower and the bed - that and the size of the room made the standard queen very comfortable for one person, perhaps a bit crowded for two. Bed very low to the ground and you really have to step up and over into the shower/bathtub so not recommend for anyone with mobility issues!Downstairs lobby bar was loud at all times but I did not hear any noise from any of the bars in my 13th floor room, even on Saturday night.

In its first few years, the hotel was uber cool. Today, it's lost its edge and someone has forgotten to tell the front of house staff - who still seem to carry an attitude that they're working for ""The Standard"" as opposed to the customer.The Rooftop bar is still great (although it too could do with an interior update), as is The Grill restaurant.We also love the gym here which has one of the best views of the Hudson River situated on Level 17.","Melbourne, Australia","mpoh2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",2,4.0

The staff was amazing, especially Marco at the front desk who was extremely helpful and took the time to find us an incredible corner king room with expansive views of the Statue of Liberty, One World Trade, Empire State Building, and the Hudson River from its floor to ceiling windows! The room had a very comfortable king bed, and nice corner couch/bench with a table, and a huge windowed walk in shower! The modern design of the hotel itself and it’s rooms is visually striking and well thought out. The hotel is located in the heart of the meatpacking district and super close to the Whitney Museum and lots of cool bars and restaurants. The hotel itself has a casual Biergarten, The Standard Grill a great restaurant for brunch of dinner ( there is a cafe side and a more formal restaurant area), The Top of the Standard 18th floor cocktail lounge with live jazz on occasion and breathtaking sweeping city views ( a must if you are from out of town and want a top shelf craft cocktail as you take in the magnificent skyline), and another top floor club, Le Bain, that features DJ’s, an outdoor lounge area, and even mini indoor pool for late night fun. There is also a chill little red lounge as you enter the hotel with comfortable chairs and couches that offers drinks and some food, and a dj spinning downtempo at night. During the day its a great place to relax with a coffee and a magazine or ipad. Angel in the lounge area was very friendly and insured I had a great latte to start my day during our stay. Rooms were immacualtely cleaned in a timely manner too. If you are planning a trip to NYC this is your go to hotel, forget Times Square or Financial, stay here and you have a great neghborhood to come home to and every type of restaurant or bar you could want within walking distance, plus you can take advantage of fantastic ones in the hotel itself.

This was a nice gesture...except they moved us to a floor where the air conditioning was malfunctioning during the hottest days of July (we found out the next morning that this was a known problem in the hotel that evening, though no one cared to tell us this before we consented to a move around 10 or 11pm). We actually ended up checking out early on the morning of our anniversary because the room was so unbearably hot.

First night we were in a room (1408) without bathtub and asked to be changed to a room with bath tub. Shower in 1408 didn’t have as good pressure and was quite noisy as soon as the neighbors showered and heard the beats from the rooftop nightclub. We switched to 1305 on our second day. We really enjoyed the second room, no noise at all and slept super well!Pros: great city view with sunrise over the Empire State Building, extremely comfy bed, room was very clean. Location is great in every way, close to a lot of shopping, The Whitney, restaurants etc. We also enjoyed the Rooftop bar for sundowners, as well as the biergarten for pingpong and beer.Cons: lacks a bit of the “hotel feeling” - upon check in they don’t offer to help you with luggage nor said anything about the facilities. You were kind of left with the key card to find your own way to the room. Breakfast wasn’t included, but that was ok as there are plenty of options in the neighborhood. The Standard Grill breakfast was ok at best. Staff in the reception didn’t seem super engaged - but perhaps that’s the NYC vibe.Conclusion: great value for money - would come again!

I saw an extremely low rate for their hotel and booked for a business trip. When the meeting was cancelled, I logged on to cancel the reservation (about 30 hours pre-arrival - more than the industry standard 24-hour window). Needless to say, I was surprised to find that it said I was past the window and that I would be charged for the first night.I requested that they refund the money since I was giving them 30+ hours notice and they obviously are not at capacity if they have rooms priced at $200 per night (extreme discount relative to what they normally are there). They wrote back and said (rather coldly and bluntly) that their policy allows them to keep my money and they were going to do just that. Obviously, policy is policy, but at some point you would hope a human element would kick in and make a judgement call to apply common sense instead of the revenue driven policy. I could understand if I cancelled the morning of arrival.. or if they'd been sold out for a week and could have resold the room if I'd let them... but... I gave them 30-hours notice (more than is typically required) and they still had rooms available that they hadn't sold.So, just be cautious if you are considering booking here. Read all the fine print really well, because they are going to hold you to every word.

Our major complaint would be the quality of the response of staff - there were long delays in requests for extra bedding, room service, or any other items.

It is currently 3am. Maybe I would care a little less if I was on vacation, but I’m not. When I called the front desk to complain, it was like they had heard this complaint so many times it was as expected as someone calling to order room service. (Doing the math, I’m calculating they must hear the complaint about 193 times per night: 1x20 from each of the 20ish rooms per floor X top 10 floors of the hotel, minus the few drunk guests here for the club, along with a few foreign tourists who don’t speak enough English to complain, and probably at least one Japanese couple too polite to say anything). I hate this place. I hate the plastered girls stumbling over in the elevator. I hate the unnecessarily dark hallway leading to that too slow elevator. I hate that they don’t even offer any red wine in their minibar selection to help lessen the pain of the whole experience. I hate the broken internet, and above all, I hate the thought that no one cares whether I get a good night sleep, or even a night of any sleep at all. Don’t stay here. Not joking.

Hotel is absolutely worthless. 3 of the 4 elevators are broken and were for over 8 hours. When asked to speak to the night manager was told not his problem that elevators were broken and my room rate guarantees no part of the hotel except my room. So don’t plan on any restaurants or bars because you won’t be admitted because that’s not included in your room. Also after 25 minutes of waiting for the elevator up or down you may just choose to take the stairs. Again, though it’s not their fault 3 of the 4 elevators are broken and they can’t do anything about it, they don’t seem to care or want to fix it. So pay a ton of money to stand in line to eventually get to your room and nothing else. Absolutely awful customer service and not worth 1/4 of the price you ultimately paid.

I am an attorney and don’t normally post reviews but felt compelled to in this instance. I had been to the Standard for drinks before and was excited to stay at the hotel because of the good amenities, which are the roof top bar and club. We paid nearly $500 per night. When we arrived, we were informed that the rooftop bar was off limits to guests as it had been reserved for private parties for three nights. We were very disappointed in our experience and there were NO apologies for it. We were subsequently told by staff (nonchalantly) not to book in December because the amenities were generally booked for the month of December. If you ever go here, you should call in advance to confirm no private parties.

Room, bed and color scheme are very comfortable (light wood, tones of black, beige and white). Quality of sleep is superb. The wood panelling creates a pod-like experience which truly invites the guest to enjoy the room. Bathroom is tiled with black glossy tiles and every time bathroom was flooded with water... I realized that multiple towels had a clear purpose. Amenities are of high quality although shampoo has funky scent something like clover. Front desk, reception folks are somewhat distant and removed to interact with client or customers. They plan to rush to clean out guest and when I asked about maps, folders about NYC attractions they made a funny face slightly ironice. Some can be attentive but then call next guest but I had better interaction with cab drivers than staff. I have never seen someone as manager or director, seems they need someone to really offers welcoming experience. Honestly I was not pleased with lack of warm or welcoming experience. None of that were ever close to what I was expecting. I am a genius booking and travel very very frequently. I was expecting to have a better experience from hotel and staff needs to be retrained urgently. I highly recommend having a drink at the top of standard bar, live jazz and · Concierge was non-responsive. I dialed from room to obtain tips, cultural attractions, ideas about restaurants and got a cold and generic answer.

We really enjoyed our stay - good staff on reception, confusing layout on ground floor, too damn dark to see the menu in the ground floor bar or the buttons in the lift (although we did really like the surreal lift, ridiculous as it is), and fab views from the cocktail bar. Book at table in advance if you want to sit down though. Pay the extra for a room with wall to ceiling windows overlooking the Hudson - they are small, but the ours was great. Comfy bed with good quality bed linen and a great shower. Plus I could lie in bed and see my husband’s pert bum whilst he had a shower (and for that matter I guess so could everyone on the road down below!), because the bathroom is effectively in the bedroom. The toilet is thankfully separate though. Be careful about the noise - we were on the 4th floor and the bass from the club on the 18th floor vibrated right through the room until 4am. Fortunately we were so exhausted from sightseeing and jet lag that we could have slept in the middle of the freeway and it wouldn’t have bothered us.

The shower is screened off by totally clear glass, so if you're staying here with a companion, do make sure that you know them very well - if not, you soon will do! The toilet is closed off by sliding door, but it didn't slide the full way, so not ideal...Views and cocktails from Top of the Standard bar are incredible, the decor here is really lovely. The noise from Le Bain nightclub, however, is unbearable - thumping music which goes on until 4am is a real buzzkill if you're jetlagged and need sleep...the hotel had provided earplugs, but they did nothing to muffle the banging bass.

Excellent views from much of the property - on one side all rooms face the river so no bad views from what we could tell. On the other side, you need to go up pretty high to get a decent ""city view"" - our first room on floor 11 (more about switching rooms later) had an unimpressive look across at the adjacent buildings, but when we moved on up to floor 15, we had a really nice view, including the Empire State Building. The room itself was cool, in a 1970's sort of way. It had the feel of a large cruise ship cabin, excellent floor to ceiling windows, basic but comfortable furnishings, small bathroom, very comfortable bed, extremely good shower (powerful and easily adjustable temperature). Not a ton of storage space, no drawers, just small shelves - ok for 2 nights but not sure what you'd do with more luggage than we had. Extremely quiet for a hotel in NYC - no noise from hallway or street, which was a pleasant surprise. We didn't try any of the on-site amenities except the beer garden, which was a lot of fun, it was outdoors but nicely heated on a chilly October evening, and super-friendly staff, especially Orlando, who was a great companion for game 5 of the World Series.So while there were a lot of positives, our experience with the front desk was truly horrible. We arrived at 2:30pm on a Saturday, waited in line, then were told by the lady at the desk that check-in time was 3pm, our room was ""almost ready"", and they would call us as soon as it was, probably around 3, but no later than 3:30. No problem for us. We went for a walk, not too far since we were expecting their call, which never came. We returned at 3:45, waited in line (again), different person at the desk, this time a sullen guy in a grubby shirt who didn't look up. I said we were expecting a call but never got one, to which he just grunted. Eventually got keys and went to our room. When we opened the door, there was an unpleasant smell, but at this point we were tired and irritated, so opted to just open the windows while we went out for the evening. Spent the night with windows open, smell was no better in the morning so I went to the front desk to see if we could switch rooms. Waited in line (again), was greeted by the original lady from the day before. Told her the room smelled like stale vomit that hadn't been properly cleaned, to which she replied ""well did one of you vomit?"" OMG, really?!?!? (no we did not). Then she asked why we didn't report it the day before so I said we were not thrilled with our check-in experience and were too tired to deal with it. She immediately became VERY defensive and pointed out at least 6 times that we arrived at 2:30 and check-in is at 3. Just kept repeating that, even when I pointed out that she said she'd call us by 3:30 and never did. She said she went on break. She seemed intent on arguing and proving herself right (customer service error #1), so I asked for the manager. Long delay, then I get ""she's in a meeting, but she'll call you"". So we went for a walk.... Over an hour later we get a call, manager says no problem on switching rooms, then put me on hold for ever, came back and said they were getting the room ready, but wouldn't give me the room number. I said we'll be back in 10 minutes, she said room would be ready. Back to lobby, wait in line (again), room not ready. They sent us up to original room, said they'd call in a few minutes. 15 minutes later, no call, so I called front desk to be told a guy would be ""coming right up"" with keys to the new room. Another 15 minutes pass, no guy with keys, so I call again and was told they'd be sending him right up. Eventually he did appear, new room was fine, no smell, and we decided to put away the negative experience with the front desk and enjoy the rest of our stay, which we did, hence the positives mentioned above.However, the appalling customer service we received was completely unacceptable and should be a total embarrassment to the hotel. But I got the impression this was just their regular way of doing business, they don't care, because they're in NYC, have a decent property and can fill their rooms with an endless supply of people they can treat badly - and charge a ridiculous amount to do so. Hopefully others will read this and think twice about staying here, it was so disappointing because good service would have made us repeat customers for sure.","Austin, Texas","Anne327</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",89,3.0

It is painfully hipster, with elevators that are pitch black with cool screens playing a weird video but impossible to see floor buttons. The rooms are tight but well organized and I personally love that the shower is totally open to the view. No wall to it. The front desk was a real problem. it has 4 stations, though in 3 days they never had more than two people and there was almost always a long line. The service once you got to the front was friendly, but super slow. Nobody behind the desk was in a hurry. Which works if you spend the money on 4 front desk folks, but does not if you only have one or two and there is a long line behind. To top it off, there is no concierge desk, so if you wanted to check in a wheelchair, which we did, ask a question about a restaurant, or check in for your room, it was the one single same super slow line. It is not a big lobby, so the line actually was a problem to people getting in and out of hotel. Also, our rooms key cards kept failing. In 3 days with two rooms, 4 cards stopped working. Kind of annoying situation turned into just ridiculous when we had to, you guessed it, go through the whole line again to get a replacement key. This because the front desk folks are very well trained to pay 100% attention to the person in front of them. Absolutely zero multitasking, regardless of the request. And it was just rude to ask other guests in line who had been waiting 15 mins for check in, to let us pass ahead because our key stopped working. I might return for the views, but only if I didn’t have to have any interaction at all with the front desk. Seems unlikely, so seems unlikely.

There's a TV you can project with Airplay and a WiFi speaker in the room too.We made our way to the rooftop bar around 1am - the hotel makes it clear not to expect to get in as they have a selective door policy. Most people were turned away in front of us but we made it in as a duo. We must be really awesome and cool right? Yaaaaas. The rooftop is the best. 360 views of the city and great music and great vibe. With a hot tub. Try and go the cocktail lounge in mid afternoon for a really great experience too. Everything is in the detail. The elevators. The shop. The dress code for the staff. So, so cool.We made it to brunch in the morning and had the burger which was delicious.

I ate breakfast in the ground floor restaurant every day and the food was goof. I also had dinner and a drink in the rooftop bar and despite reviews saying otherwise, the service and food was also v good. The view is of course amazing.My major issues with the hotel revolve around their policies. By far the most irritating and disappointing was the fact that after 9pm, you cannot use the hotel lift to get to the Rooftop bar. I was meeting a colleague there after a working dinner and I couldn't work out why the 18th floor button wouldn't work, either from the 15th (my floor) or reception, In the end I had to ask some (v friendly) cleaners who explained you had to go to the Lobby, walk out the hotel, go through a cordon, get screened by bouncers and then enter a separate lift after 9pm. They apologised profusely for the stupid policy although it was clearly nothing do with them. And of course when we left, instead of just going down 3 floors I had to go all the back down out and around again. It's not the walk that bothers me, just the total lack of information and respect for their customers. They may well have some security issues or similar but there is a key card system in the lift they could use or even just someone to help out and explain would be a start. Or how about a sign? It just shows me that the leadership team of this hotel have totally lost sight of their customers and are happy to put their frontline staff in the front line of a patently silly policy. Neither are good.Also on check in, I was asked for my email address. I asked why and was told it was for the wifi login. The next day I got a spam email from the Standard. Again no big deal but shows how the hotels regards its customers. This really tainted my visit and the uber-cool nature of the hotel just felt more arrogant and unwelcoming after that. The Rooftop is not really as great or exclusive as they like to think it isGiven the fact it's pretty expensive - $500 a night and the disdain with which the leadership team of the hotel treats its customerss, I don't think I'll be returning any time soon,","Hertford, United Kingdom","Jamesatye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hertford, United Kingdom</strong>",32,3.0

First when dropped off by taxi you can’t actually see where the hotel entrance is, no one to help with the luggage and doors you can’t open with luggage. Second, a really horrible, unwelcoming, dark and noisy lobby area followed by a lift you can’t find and when you get in it it’s so dark you can’t tell which button to push. Third no storage at all - a tiny hanging space, nothing more. Fourth, the bathroom is a joke - see through walls, tiny space. Fifth, for a hip hotel how about a usb point next to the bed? Six - $15 for a tiny glass of Rose. Who are you kidding? Also (not the hotels fault) the enitire area seems to be a construction site. On the positive side, the staff are great and the beds super comfy.

It is the SERVICE - Special thanks to Jade, Melinda, Phillip, Kevin, (see below for details of their service and what an outstanding hotel The Standard is) You could argue its location, the two rooftop bars, (one features a discotheque & pool, the other an elaborate bar with 360-degree views of NYC, offering late night jazz, elaborate cocktails, & delicious food), its award winning architecture, or its beer garden at the ground level. Or is it the amenities and carefully yet elegantly designed rooms? The state-of-the-art gym (open 24/7) with dimly lit lights (see my pics to see what I mean!) that offer breathtaking views of NYC located on the 17th floor, the 24-hour room service, the fully stocked mini-bar, the rooms with wall of floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the Hudson River, Italian bedding and down pillows, or the elevator that has a video collage with a depiction of heaven, hell, and purgatory created by video artist Marco Brambilla, that will make you question if you have left reality and entered into another dimension? No, that isn't why this place is so sought after and is regarded as one of the best, most chic hotels around. It is the people and service. They have to be able to accommodate probably some pretty unusual requests during all hours of the night, are the front line of reception and service for all of the aforementioned services, despite whether or not they are affiliated with some of the hotels separate entities, all with grace, speed, efficiency, and steadfast professionalism. The demands are great, the reward or recognition of services rendered I can only imagine are far and few between, and this is expected 24/7, no matter what happens, whether their fault or not. I am going out of my way to deliberately mention several people that made my stay not just memorable but enjoyable, so much so that I have been telling my friends and colleagues that this is the place to be. Jade - she was the first person I was greet by at this hotel. She was kind, welcoming, had a sense of humor, and ensured I had a easy check-in under rather tight circumstances. I extended my one day stay into a three day stay and it all started with her. Melinda - Extremely helpful, accommodating, understanding, and was able to balance my requests along with numerous other guests at the same time, while making you feel special, instead of being ignored. Not an easy feat to accomplish, with so much going on at once.Phillip Charles - Sometimes, you want to talk to someone who will give it to you straight. He is someone who has a sense of humor, is authentic, professional, and treats you the same whether you are a celebrity or John Doe. That is rare to find and its the way it should be. Kevin - In the back office, honored my rate several times, pushed back checkout several times, all with speed and efficiency and gave a great breakdown of charges. (although, I never had the pleasure of meeting him) I will certainly be back. - Sincerely,Matthew Charles","New York City, New York","malbertell</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",19,5.0

While I was tempted to present my review in a very concise manner, I think it would be more 'fun' to make it in a form of the list.Here we go:1. Check in process was very complicated; I have to wait for 30 minutes even with booking in advance.2. Music was so loud at the reception area; both I and receptionist has to raise up the voice in order to communicate properly.3.It was very dark in the elevator - barely see anything.4. After half an hour waiting time, we went to the room and it was still occupied by other guests. This was happened at 7.00 PM - unbelievable.5. I went down to the reception and she said ""Oh. I will give u the upgrade room"" but not a word of apology. Very unprofessional manner.6. The upgraded room was completely the same as the former one but nobody inside.7. The transparent bathroom (literally mean it) is very slippery because of the type of tiles; also at night when someone have to go in to the bathroom and must turn on light, it would have irritated the others.8.The edge of the bedside hang bar is poorly designed with sharp edge; prone to hit you at the head anytime.9. There is no storage space for your baggage in the room. No amenities at all.10. There is no towel bar nor towel ring in the bathroom except a tiny one at the door; almost like a tiny door knob.11. Your head could be banged anytime when you open the entrance due to a small open closet and shelves covered with the curtain at the right hand side with a poorly designed choice.12. I had to pay 3 nights for more than almost 1,100 USD but the experience says otherwise.To make a long story short : the standard of this hotel is the same as its LOGO - upside down. I would not recommend anyone to stay here except you want a haphazard experience.","Bangkok, Thailand","doctormee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",0,1.0

Clearly it was designed for the young hipster. Unfortunately, my wife and I do belong to that demographic. The architect and interior designer of this hotel elevated form over function. On the positive side, the staff were friendly and attentive, the rooms are bright and clean, with a lot of wood trim. But the rooms were not functional for us. To begin with the side of the tub/shower is clear glass so that everything is clearly visible from the sleeping area. While the toilet area has its own room, if someone turns on a light over the sink at night it lights up the bedroom. The bed and seating area are about 16 inches off the floor, making it difficult for older folks to get up. There are no towel racks for hanging wet towels. One is left puzzling over what to do with them. The bed is pushed up against an outside wall on one side with no bedside stand on that side of the bed. Many of the public areas and elevators are poorly lit. There is one small bulb in the elevators with the result that you cannot read the floor numbers. We literally went to the wrong floor twice because we could not see the correct numbers. What were the designers thinking? And then there is the black bar soap. It turns the sink black, leaves black under your nails, etc. see below. And then there is the solar film that was placed on the windows and has now badly wrinkled distorting the view out the window.

I was pretty disappointed. The most positive things about our stay were the service and the location. The location is awesome – blocks away from the Whitney, the High Line, and the Chelsea Market. We also had meals at the Standard Grill and the Top of the Standard. Both were pretty good.  The staff here were friendly and very accommodating. Shout out to Nico. If it weren't for him, we probably would have asked to move hotel when we arrived.  The negatives: -Room and cleanliness.  The first day when we arrived, we learned that the A/C was not working at full capacity, and it wouldn’t be fixed for a day. Nico was nice enough to locate us in a room with A/C that was partly working, and sent up some waters to the room. However, when I picked up the water glass I was disgusted by how dirty it was. It wasn’t like a small water stain, but it looked used and unwashed. There were even lip prints all over the side of the glass. We booked the deluxe king room with River view. It ended up being pretty small. The room was very humid and the carpet felt damp. There were ZERO hooks inside the room to hang our towels which was odd and inconvenient. As one could imagine – It was quite miserable to stay in a room that was hot and muggy. I ended up with a massive headache my first night and when I tried to locate some Advil through the hotel at 2:30am, I was told I had to go to a store outside to find it. -Gym: One of the main reasons I chose this hotel was for its gym. I researched hotels with good gyms, and the Standard was on the top 10 list. Needless to say, I was surprised to find out how outdated it was. We couldn’t get much of a workout since it was so hot inside the gym. Even after the A/C was fixed on our second day there was still no air circulating inside the gym. A few windows were cracked for air, but they wouldn’t stay open, unless you propped them open with a towel. The gym's equipment was outdated and worn, and they don’t even offer filtered water machines like most hotel gyms. Instead, they have an old school water fountain. I wish I could say that we enjoyed our stay, but we really didn’t.

I am so lucky that I secured very low rates for our stay here because it is absolutely not worth the full price.

First would like to say , the staff was pleasant , view was nice , and Biergarten was really nice ..With that being said , one of the reasons we stayed here was to enjoy the rooftop bar, we went up , loved it .. went to dinner and came back with another couple and was faced with the Rudest people ever . They would not allow us up , said it was guest list only and were basically treating us like we were crap . I went to the front desk , where I was literally told “ it’s up to the bouncer and there is no guest list “.. then said “ I don’t know why he wouldn’t let you up .. you are dressed cute” Seriously ? How about “ I don’t know why they won’t let you up when you just spent 3k at our hotel between staying and eating here everyday “We went back and mentioned we were staying at the hotel and told they dont care and one bouncer said “ goodbye now move “To mention - the bouncers were beyond rude - staring at us terribly .. had to seriously contain my husband We were disgusted, no regard for hotel guests, they clearly cater to non guests . So did not enjoy the hotel Bc we booked it to go to the rooftop .. and don’t fall for the line “ the bar is taken over at 9 “ .. the hotel owns the bar.. and they have complete control ..

There is a raw bar serving all kinds of stuff including beautiful king crab legs that were about 30 a pound and oysters for $1. each. When we sat with the menu even more lovely things were presented to us so we ordered from there. My companion enjoyed the artichoke salad and I thought the king crab spaghettini was yummy yummy yummy. It was recommended by the waitress who was also a delight. Can’t go wrong in this place. There are two rooms one bright and cheery and maybe a bit loud. The other darker with wood paneling and perhaps more quiet but I can’t say for sure because we wanted the light and to keep track of the weather since rain was being called for all day.

First discovered the hotel in the movie ""Shame"". I particularly like the tall windows and the panoramic views of the city. I like how they carefully chose each element of the hotel from the floor tiling of the bathroom, the bed and the wooden ceiling. Getting in the elevator is like getting in a dream. They have a psychedelic video playing. At first I thought the layout was a bit odd but it worked out well. It had a quirky and sophisticated take on their design. I like that the room included an umbrella. It was raining most of the time. Guest have an option to buy it. There had been lightning and thunderstorms on our wedding day that when we opened the umbrella, there were lightning prints inside it! We liked it immediately and bought it. It was great that the hotel has a restaurant and a cafe which served great food. We ate there twice, one at lunch time and one at breakfast time. Prices were reasonable. If you plan to stay here for a few days, and you like art, it's a stones throw away from The Whitney. The High Line park is great if you want to stroll on a sunny weekday. If you plan to go jog at Central Park, it's not far off, you can easily hop in and hop out of the train station.

Finally they blocked 500 usd on my card for a 5 night stay and then checked me in! My bags thankfully were taken to my room but the concierge gave me attitude as I probably didn’t get the chance to tip him! I was real hungry and actually starving having travelled for 10 hours and looked at the menu in the room which is beyond limited and half of the food is not available all the time so decided to go downstairs! I ended up in the brasserie restaurant cause it was either that or sandwich’s and landed up paying over 130 usd for a meal I would pay 50 usd outside! But atleast I got food! Went back upstairs to notice that even water was charged in the room the hotel didn’t even offer complimentary water with the room and mind you the rooms aren’t cheap!The next morning I woke up and ordered breakfast which was beyond normal and also overpriced! The laundry too! The housekeeper wouldn’t make my room everyday until the late afternoon and when I would come exhausted I would need to leave my room so it could be made!The hotel is not close to anything if you visiting for tourism so be prepared to pay high amounts if you want to travel by taxi and the staff at reception are not helpful at all!Laundry services are expensive and overpriced even for a nyc hotel!One night I forgot my key and wallet in the room and went for a cigarette with my phone the reception wouldn’t let me into my own room even after confirmation of everything and I was even carrying my mobile and they had my passport copy so could have verified the pic! Strange! in the end after a long time I requested that security escort me to the room and then see if it’s mine! And finally that happened which was not easy either!I’m sure as most of my experiences the hotel will apologize without any compensation and I would be asked to spend my money again so they can fix the issues sorry if hotel management really feel bad they should provide complimentary stats to customers to correct the wrong doings!

Bathrooms should be renewed. Gym should be way way bigger (there no power rack, no lat machine for your back, limited dumbells). So is this a bad hotel? Of course not, it s pretty good!

The Standard is definitely that, but with a friendly smile versus a snooty velvet rope. Art brings us to town most often, and The Standard is literally a baseball throw away from The Whitney. And of course, the galleries, shopping, dining and nightlife of the Meatpacking District, Chelsea and the Village are all nearby. The views of the Hudson and the city are great, and the High Line is literally underfoot.

The only thing I would change is catering - it seems to be geared to larger groups, weddings, etc. and we were a very small group so the price tag was high and a lot of food went to waste unfortunately.","Boston, Massachusetts","LoJo121215</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",0,5.0

I was searching for a hotel that was close to the Google offices so my husband could work and I could relax while he was working. I also wanted to be able to walk to stores and restaurants. I also needed a hotel with a fully equipped gym. The Standard met all of my requirements. Melinda S. helped us with check in. We asked for a quiet room since my husband would have to get up early in the morning. We had booked a King Deluxe overlooking the Hudson. The views were incredible with The Highline to the left of us and the Hudson directly in front of us. The room was funky and quaint. The only downside was very little closet space however there was plenty of space under the table and bench seating. I just repacked my suitcase and tucked it away. There was a closet bar in the bathroom for anything that I did not want to wrinkle. The room was so quiet I slept in very late the first morning. I had read reviews of noise from the nightclub. However we were placed on the 12th floor and had no issues. We were pretty hungry by the time we arrived and grabbed a delicious sandwich and bowl of soup at the skating chalet that was attached to the hotel. While we were eating one of the staff members walked by and we had a few questions about things to do in the area. She spent quite a bit of time telling us about the area and nearby things to do. She was very helpful. Our food was in range of typical NY prices but it was worth it. The next morning was snowing so I did not want to step out of the hotel so I grabbed a bite in the cafe at the hotel and had the prettiest drink and tasty frittatta. I then went in search of the fitness center. It was on the 17th floor and very clean. There were quite a few machines as well as spin bikes, free weights, treadmills and elliptical machines. I was practically the only person in the gym the entire week. Plus the views in the gym were as nice as our room. One of the perks of staying there and using the gym is that they washed your gym clothes for free. You just had to have it to them before 12pm and they would have it back before 5pm. A very nice perk in my opinion. They did not have water bottles but there was a water fountain right near the restrooms. I had read of this beforehand and brought my own water bottle. Melanie S. remembered us the next evening when we went back and inquired about our stay so far. She also comped us two drink tickets to the Biergarten that was at the back of the property. We spent most of our evenings there. The beer was tasty and the portions were quite large.  There was a game room behind the main room and we played shuffleboard and other bar games while enjoying our beer. Every single staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make sure our stay was a good one. And they seemed very happy to do it. I did not feel like they were just faking it like some hotel employees do. They genuinely cared about our comments and answered all of our questions. We went upstairs to check out The Top of the Standard and I felt we were very under-dressed even for a happy hour drink. The hostess was very friendly and told us to just have a seat. She didn't look down on us for not being dressed up. I would definitely stay here again. We got a corporate rate so I felt that our stay was worth the price. I would add that this hotel is preferred for adults/couples ,I don't think families with children would be comfortable here.","Campbell, California","Vivian M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Campbell, California</strong>",10,5.0

We had a corner room that offered amazing views of the city (we'd requested a Hudson River view but were told none available because of A/C problems on that side of hotel). But given the priciness of the room, and its corner location, its smallness was a surprise. The bedroom was barely bigger than the bed--you literally had to step over one corner of the bed to get to the further side of the bed. Other negatives: no way to make coffee in room; no complimentary water in room; no light in the elevators nor illuminated numbers, so floors very difficult to figure out.

You can imagine after a long day flying we were not impressed to be told the hotel is fully booked. The hotel manager Elijah was brilliant, he told us about an app to find a room for one night and we were in bed at a hotel 5 mins away within 30mins of finding out the hotel was full. The next day we went to check in, Elijah had upgraded our room and sent us up some very thoughtful treats for all the inconvience of the day before. Our room was incredible the view was just like no other. I would highly recommend the hotel and would not even think of staying somewhere else. The customer service was probably the best I have ever received on a trip. Elijah and his team know how to look after their customers. The location is brilliant, very busy on a Saturday night which was nice to see. We ate in the standard grill 3 times, after such busy days we were so tired and the food and service was great. The bill was very reasonable too. Thanks to everyone at The Standard for the most amazing 4 days in NYC, we will be back!",,Mrs25383,1,5.0

Maybe a little too hip, if you're over age 25 and looking for a space to enjoy the hotel. Our rooms view was very sad and only had an interior view of construction. We were told we could move to a room with a view with a smaller bed for an additional $50 a night. I agreed and asked to see the room and was then told, "" Oh too bad, we are now fully committed.""  The rest of our three days was pretty much looking at this hotel ""fully committed"" to the thousand of early 20's squad that came in from outside hotels to party it up at their disco at night and outdoor roof area during the day. We attempted to have a drink on the rooftop area but found it was sitting on the concrete floor room only. No room for someone looking for an afternoon Moscow Mule among the red bull/ shot takers/ pot smokers sitting on the concrete floor up there. The smell was horrific up there. There was an alternative indoor cocktail room, but alas we were not accepted there due to the fact that I was not dressed in proper dress attire. I was wearing open toes sandals, flip flops. I have never been a guest at a hotel to have the privilege of being turned away from the bar for inappropriate attire. It was kind of sad to not have a drink available at the hotel.  There was no coffee maker in the room, which made mornings pretty memorable. Long walks to find coffee at local shops or either getting dressed to make the way to the cafe downstairs. This was also negative fun. Getting coffee should not be difficult and expensive ($17 for room service to bring it up and a long wait.) The hotel was comical at first but after a few days it was exhausting and a bit smelly.Location is nice but there's other hotels in a nice locations around the West Village and Chelsea area.","Charleston, South Carolina","202heatherk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Charleston, South Carolina</strong>",6,2.0

With great expectations in mind for our stay he recommended one of his go to spots in Hells Kitchen and secured us a great table and bottle of bubbly. The Standard was on top of my list when booking and I’m glad it was. The hotel was very clean and top notch. Our room itself was impeccable and we felt “The Standard” for sure.

The answer is yes. Because it is in a beautiful place, because it offers an extraordinary view at any time of day or night, because it has the charm of the trendy place, because the rooms (choose the bigger ones if you can because the Standard Queen are a bit claustrophobic: better the Corner Kings...). However, the staff who believe that being cool means being rude and disorganized, a continuous procession of losers aspiring to be influencers who create traffic in the lobby and elevators to reach the legendary rooftop bar, two poor quality restaurants, prevent this hotel to earn the gallons of the luxury hotel and to deserve consideration for any of the soft aspects it offers. In short: the beautiful rooms with windows overlooking NY and the Hudson even when you take a shower, the design certainly nice and the architecture underline how the attractiveness of this place (and the only reasons to come) are exclusively of ""hard"" type. On the other hand, if you are sensitive to the soft aspects, you want to be pampered and you like a muffled environment in which to live an experience made of elements such as the attention of the staff, an impeccable service and perhaps with a quality restaurant, orient your choices elsewhere. I started with a question and I end with a question: are we really sure that to be trendy you have to be rude or is there an alternative that welcomes kindness and efficiency as the new coolness?","Treviso, Italy","Lavitainviaggio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Treviso, Italy</strong>",59,3.0

Her excitement and customer service made us feel happy to be there. We were even upgraded to a King corner Room and the view was AMAZING. Thank you, Stephanie! The only unsettling and upsetting thing Is that the sheets were disgusting. They had stains on them and it looked like housekeeping was trying to hide that by flipping the pillows over out of sheer laziness. It was too noticeable for them to miss that while cleaning the room. You guys have to do better. My last issue is with one of the customer service reps that answered the phones. I wish I got her name, but rather than being polite her response when i said hello was “what is it that you Need.” If you’re unhappy with your life or hate what you do, there’s always an opportunity to change it.

The hotel also has a restaurant downstairs, as well as a spacious beer garden with ping pong tables and other pub games. Food was okay, nothing superb.

There were no drink specials but the bartenders were friendly. Some issues we ran into (not necessarily the hotel’s fault):- I forgot to bring contact solution, had to go to CVS late at night.- We tried to bring some more guests up to our room, but after a certain time of night, they were pretty firm on “no more than 2 guests can come up to visit your room,” which was a bummer, but understandable from a noise control standpoint.Front desk was otherwise responsive and helpful.

As was the ridiculously comfortable bed and hooded robe (love!). I'm a total product snob and the custom formula Davines hair and body products are fantastic. So fantastic I'm ordering the Shampoo and Conditioner (that's a first).

He loves The Standard and though I’d never been his opinion alone had me sold. When we arrived our room wasn’t ready but we were given free beer vouchers for the nearby Biergarten (score). We treated ourselves to a lunch at The Standard Grill (highly recommend their assortments of meats and cheeses, it’s a lot like mischplatte) until we were called and told our room was available.Unfortunately when we arrived at our room we found that we had a (still beautiful) view of the cityscape instead of the Hudson as specifically requested. Though he debated on mentioning it, my boyfriend called down and inquired as to why we weren’t given our original room. We were told the previous guest had smoked in the (nonsmoking) room and left burns in the carpet, leaving the room unavailable for use! Bummer! However, The Standard demonstrated their excellent customer service skills. We were introduced to Alexander from Guest Experience management (I’m probably butchering the department name, apologies) and escorted to a gorgeous contemporary penthouse suite! Needless to say we were incredibly surprised and though the suite was still facing the city we couldn’t have been more grateful and satisfied.For my first experience at The Standard it was beyond amazing! My boyfriend and I would like to extend our special thanks to:Alexander from Guest Experience Management! It was nice meeting you and thanks a million!AndStephanie from the front desk!

But I had never stayed there. Saw a great deal online and booked it for a weekend staycation with my bf. I have always heard the service at the Standard is bad. So I was skeptical when checking in. However the front desk agent seemed nice and very helpful. We loved our room on 9th floor because it's far away from the noise from the rooftop, and we got a very sick view. After we settled in, we decided to check the property more. (I am in the hospitality industry so I always check a hotel property when I stay somewhere, especially when it's a boutique hotel.) It definitely felt different during the day time LOL since I have been here so many times but only after dark. We first went to check out The Top of The Standard. Well, I was trying to take a picture for Instagram. But I was turned away because I was wearing sneakers. I had explained I was a hotel guest and was doing a staycation so I did not pack anything fancy, and asked if I could just go take a picture real quick. Unfortunately, the answer was no. So I want to explain, you know how some people have great ""street style"" that they pair their sneakers up with a nice jack/coat? Well, I was wearing a pretty fancy long coat from Tibi. I thought it was stylish but well, what do i know right? And the most ridiculous part was that, this angry looking guy let two people wearing jeans and white sneakers in. So I truly did not understand. But guess what, I took a nice picture through the door and got featured by Beautiful Hotels. Interesting turn of events but still does not help me understand their pretentiousness. Then we went to Le Bain. Apparently, you were not allowed to get into the elevator with a jacket or coat. Unfortunately, i was wearing a tank under my jacket... Again, staycation error i suppose. I asked if I could just go in and take a picture real quick and then leave, and of course the answer was no. So yea i was frozen to death and the place reeked!!! No wonder I always had a good time going there after dark, because I was never sober there before. But everything sure is different under the broad daylight. And the view? Meh. I have seen better. It was just not worth the cold.We loved the neighborhood so we did not complain about the stay. But honestly, I would never stay there again, at least not when I am sober... The whole lobby smelled horrible and there were way too many drunk people (non guests mainly) shouting and bumping into you. Just not my type of scene when I want a nice staycation. The most frustrating part is that the hotel treats the paying hotel guests no different than people who go there to get drunk. Sure, working in the hospitality gives me very high standard for service. But I also am very reasonable. I understand The Standard is a ""party hotel"", but when you pay to stay there, don't you want to be treated at least a little different than non paying guests? I have done so many staycations in the city at boutique and luxury hotels, never once I had felt like an outcast. And yes i have stayed at many hotels with vibrant nightlife scenes (eg Dream Downtown and PUBLIC etc and they made me feel so special). So yea I would never stay there again. Would I recommend it to my friends? Well if they plan to party all night there then go right ahead. It's the perfect place because they would not likely to remember anything anyway...We checked out yesterday and today, my boyfriend got a $28 charge for an umbrella we never used. COME ON... And an extra $2 charge for the Highline park renovation... Well, next time, maybe we will accept the $2 charge if you tell us upon check-in.","New York City, New York","TheVIPineapple</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,3.0

It's the sort of hotel that makes you feel like they are doing you a favour by letting you stay - too cool for school kind of attitude. The staff in the restaurant and indeed the restaurant itself was great. The bar at the top was quite another story. If you want to sit down at any table in the bar you have to book - whether or not you are staying at the hotel - as their ""members"" get priority and even on a Sunday night when it was half-full and we wanted a 7pm table we were told we couldn't have one until 7.30 which was a bit odd. The rooms are small but clean, although there is no-where to put clothes, apart from 4 hangers - no drawers anywhere. We stayed with them for three nights, on our last night the lock on our door broke and we were forced to move rooms; no-ones fault, these things happen, and we were thrilled to be moved to one of the corner suites on the 6th floor, we had been in a small room on the 8th floor. The view from the suite wasn't nearly as good but the room was larger and had a great bath in it, all lovely you might think. The noise coming from the night-club on the top floor was just shocking in this different part of the hotel. We had boom, boom, boom until 4am so no sleep. I complained the following morning when we checked-out and they were kind enough to give us a small amount off the bill but even so, I don't think we will be returning. If someone were to ask me, I would suggest one night at this place is quite fun, it's a sexy hotel. I am baffled as to why anyone would take a child and I saw quite a few children which made me feel quite uncomfortable. In the lifts there are various videos being played, one of which was quite sexually explicit.","London, United Kingdom","I8878WLjessicam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",12,3.0

I mentioned it to the front desk upon departure, so hopefully the next guest doesn't have the same issue - just wish I hadn't!

I know I’m a bit late writing this review but here goes... I surprised my husband for his birthday. We stayed in the Hudson Studio. The view was absolutely fabulous!!! I had surprises at various times during our trip. The concierges Kay, John, Erin, and Colleen ALL helped discreetly in preparing every detail and having it go so smoothly. They answered every question and request immediately. I had planned minor requests as hot chocolate to the luxurious in-room couples massages. It was as if we were in “Neverland”. We wanted time to stand still and indulge in every moment. We happened to stay while the weather was 50 degrees in JANUARY! (1/20-1/21)We walked mid-afternoon the High Line and brought back take out from Chelsea Market. Later in the evening we enjoyed what seemed to be privately ice skating at their rink and relaxing under their heated seating area. Of course we traded in our skates for dancing shoes and hit up Le Bain. The next morning we pampered ourselves with a delicious breakfast at the Grill. It truly was a remarkable overnight getaway. I am THANKFUL to the whole concierge team because without their knowledge and support, I would have been lost in making my husbands birthday a memorable one for years to come.

Bed so low it was not easy to rise; layout and fixtures in some bathrooms were bizarre. The clearance between spout and basin in our sink was less than 3 inches: impossible to fill a water glass, and I have bloody hands from trying to shave.

It looks so cool and majestic sitting there on the Highline in the Meatpacking district. I booked a corner room for about $732/night and insisted on a corner room with a tub. Service upon arriving at the hotel was sub par. Front desk staff was minimally helpful. Took elevator up to our high floor room. Hallways look cheap with rubber cove base running along the bottom of walls wear the carpet meets. Bright fluorescent lighting like in a dorm. Our room had the most amazing view. It was very small. Bed was comfy, but nightstands were flimsy and weak. Bathroom sink too shallow and small. Tub was nice and big. Great place to sit and look at the city and watch the snow fall. Great view of the Empire State Building. No complimentary coffee maker so you have to pay $16 to have them deliver 2 cups worth to your room. Room was tiny for the price which is ok with me but the quality in general was sub standard and everything looked a little worn out. Gym was fantastic with a great view of the river. The restaurants downstairs were great for young adults who want to see other young kids, but for my wife and I who are used to more sophistication we found it to be hectic and kind of like a college hangout. The hotel feels like it’s run by a bunch of college kids. I don’t think I will stay here again. Had to try it but not worth the price in my opinion. The club upstairs was super cool but again lacking in service.","Oahu, Hawaii","kendricw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oahu, Hawaii</strong>",1,3.0

Very cool & modern, lobby could use a little refreshing. Room was very trendy, typical size for NY. Awesome bathtub, but not the stand alone tub we requested. View from the room was amazing. water-closet, no fan. Shower/sink/bathtub all in 1 room with no door. No trash can either. 1 minor flaw, no soap, just shower gel (even for your hands) that smelled strongly of dryer sheets or men's cologne. Very strong. Almost offensive. Great bluetooth speaker by bed. small dinette. Great room service. Wish there was a guide to the hotel in the room. We weren't sure where the ""cool"" bar was, where breakfast was served that came with our package or where restaurant was located. We asked & explored. We still don't know what was in the basement! Cool french restaurant in front of hotel & a very cozy restaurant inside. Decorated for the holidays. The expense of the lighting in the hotel must be incredible! Small Skating rink out front. Breakfast was very good & service was quick, warm & friendly.

The hotel itself is very artsy and intriguing and I loved that about it. Check-in went smoothly. I was prepared for a small room as my fiance warned me that it's NYC and not to expect much, so the room was understandably smaller than what I am used to. The room was decorated nicely and with such a small space, I can understand the configuration of the shower/vanity/toilet. The view was pretty, etc. etc. Our room was on the 9th floor and we could hear the club in the hotel, though it was just a dull bass, nothing necessarily to keep me up with earplugs in (provided by the hotel). But my BIGGEST complaint was on the night of my 30th birthday, a Friday night, when we tried to go to the 18th floor bar and the doorman told us that it was for MEMBERS ONLY and sent us away. Guests of the hotel get sent away from an empty club?! The concierge then told us we could go to La Bain BUT it would be doorman's discretion whether or not we could get in? Like, are we not pretty enough or fancy enough? ""Luckily "" we were allowed in to La Bain, which was 100% empty at 11 pm on a Friday night.

Throughout our stay they continued to bend over backwards to help us get reservations at amazing restaurants, front row seats at fashion week shows and even an impossible-to-get private VIP tattoo booking with JonBoy during fashion week.To Erin, thank you for being our personal concierge for the time we stayed and to the rest of the concierge team, Colleen, John and Kaheen, we cannot thank you enough for going out of your way for us and making our trip so memorable. We truly felt like we were part of the family by the time we left.Now to the hotel itself. You couldn't ask for a better location - right in the middle of the action in meatpacking, and easy to get up to mid-down, up-down and down to lower Manhattan. There are an abundance of great venues to eat and drink at both within and around the hotel - The Standard Grill, in particular, is fantastic.The rooms are fantastic. We upgraded to a Hudson Studio Suite which I understand are the most popular suites. We felt like we were right on the Hudson river, with floor to ceiling windows on three sides of the room, we had views up and down the entire river, all the way to the Statue of Liberty.Cannot recommend highly enough - the only place to stay in the city.We will be back, hopefully sooner rather than later!",,Brittaangel,0,5.0

It was my 12th time at this hotel. Prior to this stay, I was there for 10 days in September, 2017. I’ve been seen the decline in the service of this hotel, but nothing was compared to this last time. The problems started from begging, since I have booked a room with river view and ended up in a room with no river view. The explanation at the check in was that the hotel was very busy and the only rooms left were without river view, without options, I accepted. There were nobody to help me with my bags, the hall was chaotic (I check in around 9PM). I thought that would be my only problems, but I was very wrong. From the start the heating didn’t work, I tried calling but after 45 minutes trying and no answer I had to go downstairs to ask someone to fix it. Since I was late they said they would send someone the next day. Next day came nobody showed and I called again. This time someone came and fixed the problem, only for it to malfunction the next day again. In my forth day after many visits from maintenance the problem was solved. But there were far worse problems. Every single day that I left the hotel at night, even at 7PM, there were people selling drugs openly in front of the hotel entrance, they even approached us offering all kinds of drugs. Every time that happened we informed hotel security and front desk, they asked us who were doing, we showed, and surprised, they did nothing, because we stayed close to see what happened and, not once, someone approached them, or told the to leave, or called the police, NOT ONCE. When it happened while we were coming back to the hotel we looked from the window to see if the hotel would take any action, but hours would go by and the hotel did absolutely nothing. I have never witnessed it before, but this time there were construction next to the entrance of the night club and the dealers changed their place (that was said very calmly from a lady in the check in counter). I really don’t want to stay in a hotel that believes this kind of things are normal. Coming and going from the hotel felt very insecure, but nobody cared. But the icing on the cake happened on Saturday (Nov, 11th). Since our flight was late at night, I paid the room until November, 12th, but for some reason I don’t know the hotel system had our check out date at November, 11th. We left the room to lunch and when we came back our keys were not working, so we went to the check in counter again, a very aggressive man told us that the keys were not working because we were supposed to have left at 12PM and it was 2PM. He went on to say how we were causing trouble to the guests that were going to occupy our room, since they had already arrived to the hotel and were waiting for us to vacate the room. We explained that our reservation was for the check out on November, 12th, he doubted and we showed the reservation. He asked for a minute, took my phone to his manager and came back saying we were right ang gave us new key. No apologies, no sympathy, nothing, gave the keys, said the day was busy and asked us to go. We left the hotel and came back to pick up our luggage and go to the airport. The keys, again, didn’t work, but, at least, this time, they gave us the key without complaint. We trying calling someone to pick up our luggage but once again nobody picked the phone at front desk or luggage. My boyfriend went downstairs and asked someone to pick it up. I was in the room when the guy came. He came with no cart. I said that he could pick up the luggage e take it downstairs, but I would stay at the room because I was had some things to do. He pretended that he didn’t listen to me, entered the room, put all my luggage in the hallway, the lady from housekeeping that was knocking on the door every 5 minutes even with the do not disturb sigh the door entered the room, the guy went through all the things inside the room and basically kicked me out of the room. He radio someone saying that the problem was solved, that front desk could tell the guests waiting for the room that it would be ready in 10 minutes. I payed for that night, I had the right to stay. It was 3PM. It was disrespectful and unacceptable. Since I was kicked out I went to the check in counter to check out and informed what had just happened. The lady said she would inform her superior and see if it was possible not to charge me for the extra night I payed, but could not use. She explained that the hotel was very busy because there were lots of events at the hotel that day. And that is a guest problem why? If you don’t have the capacity to do that many events at once, don’t do it. Once we check out we had to wait almost 1 hour to have our luggage. The luggage carts were there, but there were no one to carry it. We offered to pick up the bags (that stayed more than 1h in the hallway pf the 12th floor), but they informed us we couldn’t use the cart. So we waited. In the check out we were promised that everything we said were going to be passed on to the superiors and the hotel was going to contact us. I waited more than a week, and nothing came. I am really disappointed and pretty sure I won’t stay at The Standard a 13th time.",Rio de Janeiro,"Raphaela_BR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong>",10,2.0

The only gripes I have are minor - the strange lack of a bin! The headboard is not permanently attached to the rail above the bed so I knocked it off at 3am and thought what the hell it that on my face... soon sorted and most annoyingly the whistling sound caused by a gap at the bottom of the door into the corridor - soon sorted with floor towel stuffed against it.

While I have stayed in a lot of NYC hotels this one was the most attentive a good example being they called up to the room to let me know we left a wrapped present in the back seat of our car to make sure we didn't need it. Room was spotless when we showed up ( mirrors in the bathroom always are a good example ) room was dust and scent free. the open bathroom is different but we actually really enjoyed it since the view was one of the most important parts of the stay.

You have to be prepared to be on full display with the floor to ceiling windows, but in return you have a sun-filled room with spectacular views. Our Room was at the end of the Corridor facing the Hudson, so we had perfect exposure to the north, south, and east. The room is VERY open style, but works perfectly for two. It's well worth spending the extra money for a somewhat larger room -- by New York standards, ours was definitely on the larger side. It was great to be high enough so that we did not have an obstructed view, but were still tantalizingly low to be able to look down onto the pedestrians walking the Highline. Yes, that includes from the bathroom. The amenities are all super cozy and the room service had excellent choices. Depending on what view you're looking for, you may want to be quite specific when booking a room. We had a clear view of the World Trade Center, but that came at the expense of being able to look up toward mid-town.

So, I am used to NYC hotels. Some good, some not so good. never awful, till now. This one, I wanted to try. but, I will not return. First, when we arrived, Couldn't find the front door, Circled twice before I saw it. My wife had to go into the hotel to get someone to valet my car. Check in was quick and easy. The room (1420) was small, even for NY standards. Absolutely no where to put our bag. European style bed, Very low, otherwise, ok. I paid for a deluxe queen. I was looking on their website. The room they pictured was not what I was in. Called down and was told the deluxe queen and the standard queen are the same room, The deluxe queen is just a higher floor. Which, being a NYer and staying in many NY hotels, I knew that was better, Less white noise from the city below. I was wrong! (we'll get back to that). Went to the rooftop bar in the late afternoon for drinks, Was nice, great views. very overpriced drinks. Spoke to a nice woman there, told her we would come back after dinner. She said the bar would be closed for a private event. Really? I've never stayed in a hotel that closes it's bar to it's guests. However, she did give us a card and said to email them, Make a reservation and we could come back. So, I did. I got an email back asking what time we were returning, Said 10ish. Got another email back saying. Can you come earlier, we close at 7:30. Again, Seriously? Gave up, went to a bar outside the hotel. Finally got back to our room, on the 14th floor. (up high, quieter, so i thought). we were awoken by this intense pounding. Which, being a former club DJ myself. I knew exactly what it was. And it was loud! Very loud! and the club was 4 floors above us. Couldn't even imagine what it was like in the club. We tried to ignore it. But, no way. Called down and complained. Told, Matt (I think). Either get it turned down or be prepared to comp my room. I swear it got louder after that call. Needless to say, I was pissed! Got up, dressed, went down to the lobby. Spoke to a manager. He must have know who I was. First words out of his mouth was, ""We'll comp your night"". Which they did. After he said that. I told him, you need to turn it down. Which it appeared they did. But, It still kept us up until around 3-3:30AM when it finally stopped. It was an unfortunate situation all around. They do not cater to their guests like other NYC hotels. The staff seemed very nice. Room was clean, tiny, but clean. Weird set up. Toilet is literally in a closet. shower tub and sink all in one room. but, not partitioned. water gets everywhere. Needless to say, i will not be returning. I recommend going to the W. Love those hotels. Oh, and FYI. The Standard website says $65.00 to valet the car. It was $85.00 for one night. But, at that point, I wasn't going to argue. just wanted to leave. Unless you plan on partying till 4 am, I would find another hotel.","Pompton Lakes, New Jersey","ajerseyguy1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pompton Lakes, New Jersey</strong>",18,1.0

Sitting at the nexus of hip LA style and NY glam this intriguing and inspiring destination attracts a mash up of the cool and wanna be cool, all seeking a slice of the high life on the high line.Upon arrival, there is an instant star quality to the lobby with its large yellow revolving doors and endless stream of posing guests and visitors. The guest suites, while not big (this is Manhattan) are intimate with quirky, Mid Century inspired interiors by Roman and Williams, and feature exposed showers and floor to ceiling windows - this is definitely not a stuffy business hotel unless you're in the business of fun, romance or exhibitionism. One can only imagine the stories that these walls could tell!In the King Deluxe Suite, the rich use of wood creates a warm and Scandinavian feeling to the curved and restrained interiors that feature some nicely contrasting black and white details. It is black that pervades most of the wet areas of the bathroom room with the said black tiles making the shower impossibly dark. Given its revealing nature this is no doubt purposeful, so too the complimentary prophylactics. The room is appointed in way that says you're here to stay for a good time and not necessarily a long time, but if you're stay is more than a one nighter (which is a must) you'll be more than pleased to see a healthy array of bar snacks, sweets, drinks, socks, a scented candle, blue-tooth speaker, earphones and a host of bespoke toiletries, along with a book of short stories - all ensuring that you are prepared for whatever the Meat Packing District can throw at you.As far as local attractions, the list really is endless. Of course there's the High Line directly below which takes you all the way to the Hudson Train Yards which makes for a beautiful early morning walk. There's the Chelsea Market, Whitney Museum of Art, boutique fashion stores galore and more food options than you can imagine - from Dos Caminos to Catch, The Red Cat and Scarpetta to name but a few.In the end, The Standard is a kaleidoscope of a venue offering a cheeky, irreverent and fun filled platform to explore and consume Manhattan to the fullest.

Everything at this hotel is different starting from the elevator (although too dark I could barely see the room key). They have a top notch rooftop overlooking Manhattan.

There were no rooms with 2 beds so we shared a bed, which is fine, but what was really strange was the glass-encased shower. This shower is in every room in the hotel. Are there that many people that prefer to shower in front of someone else? Does it make it easier to optimize the room layout? OK so besides the shower - here some basic pros and cons.Pros - Great location. Meatpacking is where it's at! And of course - sitting atop the High Line isn't too shabby.Outstanding food & bev on premesis (the bar on the terrace was WONDERFUL as was the staff - so nice!)Staff was extremely helpful and kind.Room was clean and quiet with a great view.Cons - Room was tiny, even for NYC.Elevator service was TERRIBLE. There's a certain time during the day (early evening) where hotel guests must SHARE the elevators with the hipsters trying to get up to the club. At a certain time (later in the evening), hotel staff usher the guests to a working elevator while clubgoers wait for their own, but before that it's absolutely insane.Price - this hotel is SO EXPENSIVE. I expected more. Not sure what - but more.So - though I somewhat enjoyed this alien experience, I wouldn't stay again.","Dayton, Ohio","Jessica M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dayton, Ohio</strong>",55,3.0

All aspects of this hotel are anything but the standard when it comes to a typical stay in New York, or elsewhere. First off, the service provided by hotel employees is second to none. From my very first steps in the door, Diede at the front desk was incredibly kind, and helped with all kinds of random questions. After dealing with credit card issues (CC company block due to size of charge), she patiently worked with me to post the charge in smaller increments and wait while I talked with my credit card company. After that fiasco, she still took time to map out the neighborhood and recommend local attractions. After receiving that long list of local places for food and drink (thanks Diede and Kevin C at the front desk), I found it was hardly necessary to ever leave the property. Top of the Standard, Standard Biergarten, Standard Grill and Standard Plaza all provide entirely unique experiences and amazing tastes of the City. But, walking less than a block also opens up a plethora of wide-ranging options. I should mention, the Meat Packing District (and West Village in general) is certainly well-suited for a younger crowd, and may not be the ideal location for couples seeking a slower pocket of NYC. This said, the Standard goes above and beyond in ensuring a romantic and peaceful setting for those seeking out that style of vacation. In fact, despite the lively and youthful atmosphere in that area, the Standard could be a hotel better suited for couples seeking a romantic stay. I was put up in the hotel for work, and as a single young person looking to have some fun in the evenings, I also found that the hotel itself and general area provided endless opportunity. All this said, I would obviously not call this a family-friendly hotel either, but assume most folks looking to stay in the area already know this. The room itself was top-class, in my opinion. The view, the bed, shower, and bathroom in general were complete luxury. I found the only complaint that could be made is in regards to the size of the room, but I personally didn't need any excess space, and again, this is not the hotel for bringing along the kids. Additionally, housekeeping was beyond respectful of my privacy and belongings, and would actually go out of their way to ensure my room was cleaned each day even if I was not out of the room until after scheduled housekeeping hours. The view from my room certainly stands out and cannot be found at just any hotel in New York. It was actually difficult to leave the room at times because of the sweeping views of Lower Manhattan and Jersey City (I had a relatively clear view of the Statue of Liberty from my bed). Other sides of the building can offer even better views, from what I could tell. Overall, I would never leave anything but 5 stars, and will absolutely be back.",,Grayson B,0,5.0

I splurged and decided to get the Hudson suite for me and my significant other. Which came out to around $800. Upon arriving at the hotel approximately 45 minutes after check in which started at 3, we were told that the room wouldn't be ready for another hour and a half. Which put us in a predicament because we had to be at a concert in an hour and would have nowhere to get ready or drop our bags off or even rest after 4 hours of travel. Long story short we ended up getting ready in the only lobby bathroom holding up everyone who was trying to use it. Which made us feel even more embarrassed in a crowd we already didn't feel welcomed in. Our bags were left on the counter who with the very polite person who was assisting us with checking our bags. We only arrived back to the hotel around midnight. Our bags as well as food we ordered through grub hub were delivered up to us in the room which was nice! The room itself was extremely clean, the bed was comfortable, sheets spotless, and mini bar completely stocked with reasonable prices for the items. I also appreciated the open layout of the room with an all glass shower.  As nice as the room was, the views were subpar for rooms that are being advertised as one of the main selling points being the view. Maybe this was just because of the low floor, but we were treated to a view of construction workers and an up close view of the NYC sanitation building which was also covered in construction workers which were directly level with our room. Part of me wanted the room to be upgraded or moved to a higher floor because of the huge inconvenience of not having the room ready when it was expected to be but im not the type of person to complain to already frantic hotel personnel. Overall, I can say I certainly won't be back to this hotel. It just wasn't worth the price that I paid for it.

There was a double bed, a table with a bench, and a desk chair. The bathroom had a large tub as well as a shower. So, it was fine.The clientele seems remarkably uniformly hip. I didn't do a complete survey, but I'm pretty sure I was the oldest and least hip person in the hotel.It's located next to Chelsea Market and by the High Line. It's on an odd nook of a street which has the advantage of cutting down on some of the street noise. My room on the fifth floor wasn't exactly silent, but it wasn't noisy, and this is NYC so that's pretty good.Because it's in an odd nook, and because the Standard doesn't believe in signage, I wandered around longer than I should have trying to find it. Look for a door the color of Big Bird. Above it you might notice the upside-down sign.The wifi is free but at 1.5mbps is pretty minimal. You can instead opt to pay $20 (!) to get an unspecified better connection. There are adequate electric outlets in the room.If you're young and hip you well may like this hotel more than I did.

I recently just stayed at your highline property in New York City last weekend (Friday September 8 through the 10th). I planned a special getaway, Upon initially making a reservation and the other reservations line I booked a superior king room i mentioned to the reservations associate I specifically wanted a corner room and they were able to guarantee us a corner room. I even after the call and making the reservation i contacted the hotel front desk the day of arrival and they said we did indeed have a corner room. Upon arrival we checked in and once we got to our room, the room was not a corner room as we were promised. I went back down to the front desk and spoke to one of the front desk employees which he said the hotel is sold out and there is nothing he can do nothing about it in a slightly snide tone... He then later passed me onto Samantha Yang which had the pleasure of working with. She was so kind and courteous very understanding of the situation, and again very helpful and given it was New York fashion week I knew the hotel was hectic and instead of brushing us off she was extremely courteous to us and was able to reserve a corner room for us the following night. The following day she was able to move us early (11am) upon getting our new corner room which was AMAZING!!!! She even went as far as sending us a bottle of champagne apologizing for the mixup which we enjoyed drinking while eating the Sunset from our Riverview Corner room. I can't tell you how rare that is nowadays to have employee like that . As someone that travels so much all over the world and stays in countless hotels all over the place having an employee like that is priceless. Given how many hotels there are New York City she has guaranteed all of my, my family's, and companies future business will be given to this hotel. You've ensured my loyalty to your hotel every single time Im in New York simply due to her customer service and her attention to making sure that we were happy.

It depicts, among other images, the World Trade Center Twin Towers in flames, with people leaping to their deaths, and a hooded Ku Klux Klansman! Very offensive. The small rooms have floor to ceiling windows; ask to face the river and the view of Jersey City and Hoboken! The shower had no curtain at all, so water pooled all over the bathroom floor. Why? Worse, the glass wall one one side of the shower faced the room and the window, so there was no privacy. Why? I noticed at least one creep parked on Little West 13th Street gazing up at people showering! The bed was low but comfortable. The room had a TV, a safe, wi-fi, and a mini-bar. But there was no coffee in the room, no soda machine, no water bottles, no clock.The dog park below and the bars produced both barking and drunken laughter into the night, so bring earplugs. The hotel has a silly and unenforceable rule prohibiting guests from bringing their own booze. We were quoted a wedding base rate of $294 per night; but then they charged us a base rate of $325 for the second night. And they added a $2 'Contribution'! What right do they have to force a donation to their favorite, unnamed charity?! They said they would 'look into all this' , but we've heard nothing. So watch you bill carefully.I would not pick this strange place again.","Chicago, Illinois","515acej</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",260,1.0

The room was small but looked exactly like the pictures I saw – queen bed, small bath/shower area, a tiny W.C./toilet and space for clothes. The desk and leather swivel chair were quite comfortable for working and enjoying a quick bite on the adjoining settee. The room had a floor to ceiling window with a view of the river in the distance and a parking lot / Highline below. The city view is also quite nice in the evening.

The location was ok. As long as you're able to walk you'll be just fine. There is a restaurant and several bars within the hotel and/or on the same block. The check-in experience was not ideal - we wanted to carry our own bags up to the room because we were in a bit of a rush for a rehearsal dinner and they insisted that someone bring them up. 30 mins later still no bags. When we phoned down to the lobby, they didn't seem to have a great handle on where exactly our items were. We waited for quite a bit. The elevator situation is horrendous. I think I spent most of my weekend waiting for an elevator. At times they have only two in operation with something like 17 floors. Ended up taking the stairs a lot. The room itself was nice - but if you're not into the modern concept - you will not like this room. There is no privacy for the shower area so if you're staying here with a friend who you don't want to shower in front of you may want to get separate rooms. In our particular room the shower pressure was awful and the water just pooled all over the floor - including in front of the sink. What a mess. We did have a really nice big bathtub and because of the open concept it offered a great view right from the tub - this was really nice. On Saturday we asked for ""Privacy Please"" as we had several valuable items in the room that did not fit into the safe. Upon coming back to the room later that day, the room had been cleaned.

However, the next day after I left, I got another charge for $75 of items that I did not have either. Not only is it unsanitary to leave items from previous visitors, but it seems to have caused a lot of confusion.On top of that wifi was slow, room service food was cold and soaked in grease, but at least the staff was nice.Edit:While the hotel was very helpful with the first accidental charge, they were not as kind with the second. I was charged for a $55 bottle of tequila among other items. When trying to get a refund I was redirected to a phone line that would not pick up. I was able to get slow responses through email. Through those emails, I was told that the staff confirmed the removal of the items and that the housekeeping follows up with what was taken out of the room after the stay. I understand how mini-fridge charges work, but I didn't touch those items. They were condescending and said they would do an adjustment as a one time courtesy.

We were informed when booking the rooms that we could not put 4 people in any of their rooms, that they had no adjoining rooms and would not give any assurances that our rooms would even be on the same floor. We wanted to go ahead and give it a try mainly because of the location, so we got two rooms. Check-in was easy - front desk people were fine. We did get two rooms right next to each other on the 11th floor. We had ""city view"" rooms and had a very nice view of the Empire State Building - and also a good view of the Hudson River. (There does appear to be new construction just a block or so away in the line of site of the Empire State Building - so hopefully that does not block the view in the future). We did not have any issues with noise as others have described. On various websites, it does list the Standard as having a pool - but we asked at checkin and they said ""no pool for kids"". This was fine as we kept quite busy otherwise. While the hotel itself is not necessarily geared to kids, we found it to be a great central location for a family trip. And there were a few other families with kids at the hotel. We walked the Highline every morning - the Highline ends right near the tour boat pier. A few block walk to the subway line.

Overpriced, trying to be hip, and fails at the basics of a hotel. Basics are: Decent room, comfortable bed, some food options, and reasonable amount of quiet. The only area where The Standard meets the basics is on food options.Let's start with the room. Typical small space of NYC hotels. Bathroom, some sort of bizarre combination of tub an shower where the shower essentially sprays water everywhere. All over the floor and the sink. So you end up walking in a big puddle. Items on the sink get wet. And there isn't much you can do about it. The bed? The bed is euro style meaning it's essentially a box on the floor. That's not bad, I've stayed in plenty of European hotels and love their beds. But they put some cushy mattress on the box which does not work. I woke up with a great deal of back pain as a result.Let's talk noise.... my room overlooked the Hudson and one of the highways. And apparently a garbage barge given the amount of beeping and other noise going on all night.

I booked through the hotel website and maybe that was mistake #1. As a patron of the hotel it is up to you to double check everything. You will not be alerted on differences in room rates for your stay. I never received a confirmation of my booking and when I called (mistake #2, I should have emailed so I had a communication trail) to ask for one I was told that yes that had my booking and that they would email me a confirmation. The confirmation was never mailed. The huge difference in the room rates was on the sheet I signed upon checking in and I should have noticed it. However, like most travelers, I was tired and anxious to get to my room; so I wasn't as observant as I should have been. But I can't help but think that it shouldn't be up to me to have to be extra-vigilant about this. Good customer service would make that unnecessary as I would have been alerted about that at the beginning, during the booking process - and then reminded again with the confirmation that I never got.

We had a slight issue upon check in - I accidentally booked the wrong room. I called to the front desk and spoke with Sam who instantly began trying to get us into the room I described. After a brief wait, Sam came to personally take us to our room. She was amazing, quick and efficient. On the train on the way back I got an alert from my credit card and noticed a wet bar charge that wasn't ours. I immediately called and was told I needed to call back between certain hours to 'speak with the person who needed to investigate the charge'. I called the next day and was told again to call back at a specific time. I explained that I wanted the hotel to fix my problem and then call me back; that I didn't appreciate having to do all the work to fix their mistake and was still told to call back!Then I remembered I had an email from my shero, Sam. I emailed her and of course the issue was instantly taken care of and my bill credited. I don't know when I'll be back in New York but I'm never booking at The Standard if Sam isn't around.Other hotel notes: We loved our meal at the restaurant; the food and service were amazing. The hotel is in a great location near the very cool highline, the amazing Chelsea Market (where you can get amazing food) and my favorite brunch spot, Cafe Cluney. Also everyone who works at this hotel is really good looking so pack your self confidence!It's a trendy, hip, millennial filled, stereotypical hip NY hotel and it's not for everyone. The elevator was a source of contention as it was locked off to guests during events causing big bottlenecks.

Having to deal with a shady character trying to scam you for a few extra commission dollars ruins the experience and removes this far from the realm of ""luxury"" hotels. This is a has-been hotel just trying to borrow from the reputation of its associated nightlife. The room furnishing here feels more dated and cheap than nice. Spotty tile floors, poor quality mattress, curtains that let in lots of light instead of blackout sufficient for good sleep, overall it feels more like a bad chain than high-end hotel.

I stayed for five nights and when I'm away for that long I prefer to unpack and not live out of my suitcase. There was a small wardrobe with a shelf and a bar with a few hangers right inside the door and that was it. The only good spot for my suitcase was standing upright in the wardrobe, unless I wanted to put it somewhere in the middle of the floor where I'd risk tripping over it.I traveled with a family group and we had a dinner and several breakfasts at The Standard Grill.

The service was adequate, at best, and the elevator situation and complete lack of access to the roof top bar due to private events all 3 nights we were there was ridiculous. Here are the details of my experience:I booked a corner view room at $735/night - I had stayed in 1411, a corner room on a prior stay, fantastic views from the higher rooms on that side of the hotel - For this stay, I was assigned room 510, yes, it was a corner room, but it was on a lower floor on the city side, so the floor to ceiling windows were useless with ""views"" of buildings and ventilation equipment on the top of nearby buildings - no views at all - and the rate was the same as my last stay - $735/night - and 510 was much smaller as well. I called the front desk explaining the difference in what I expected for $735 and what I got - they moved me to 1411, the same room I had the prior stay, but there was a 5-10 min delay for the elevator because they had 2 elevators exclusively for the private party at the roof top bar and only 2 elevators for all the hotel guests - ALL the service personnel/service carts/room service carts were also sharing the limited elevator capacity with the hotel guests, and given the size of the service carts, few guests fit in the elevator after the service equipment is loaded. I didn't realize that first night that the grossly inadequate elevator situation would be a huge inconvenience all 3 nights due to the private parties at the roof top bar, which also set up a situation where we were not able to go up to the roof top bar our entire stay - there were lines in the elevator area every night to get back up to the room, and there were also guests of the private parties trying to get on the hotel elevators thinking they could get up to the 18th floor private party without waiting in the long line for that which was outside - I mentioned my dissatisfaction with nonhotel guests making the already long elevator lines even longer, and I asked why the heck don't they put a security person to screen to make sure only hotel guests can get on the 2 remaining hotel elevators - no one seemed to care - at all...except the other hotel guests who were complaining. In addition, one of the two hotel guest elevators only allowed 3 floor buttons to be pushed at one time, so any time there were guests staying on more than 3 different floors, all the buttons reset and had to be pushed again, but only 3 at a time, so when someone got off on a lower floor, the next person up could then push their floor number. The gym is adequate, but there is no water available, other than a drinking fountain out the door - I find that most often, at a hotel where I'm paying $735/night for a room, there are water bottles in the gym and often fruit as well - minor for the hotel to provide, but so many other hotels provide that service - and that is because guests using the gym appreciate a bottle of water to use on the cardio equipment so they don't have to get off, and walk out the door to get a sip of water - or at a minimum they have chilled water available, in the gym, for guests to refill personal bottles.I was not alone in grumbling about the elevator lines, lack of access to the roof top bar and the resetting elevator buttons, all of which took away from the experience. The manager did credit 50% of one of my nights stays, a nice gesture, so my stay was $1850 rather than $2200 - but I'd rather have spent that $1850 on a 3 night hotel stay at one of the other fabulous NYC hotels - this stay was a real disappointment.","Tiburon, California","sftraveler12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tiburon, California</strong>",1,2.0

For the price of about $600 a night, we expected a decent place. Nothing fancy. Just decent. At least with good relaxed comfortable atmosphere , not pretentious, bland, devoid of authenticity and with nothing to show for. Which is pretty much what The Standard High Line is all about. Room was too small even for NYC. The corner seating is nice if there was space. But I'd prefer to have a bigger bed than something that is more like a full bed than a queen-sized bed. And please, what happened to the side tables? Where can I charge? The room only had 1 free socket to use which is at the opposite side of the foot of the bed. The music thumping from the night club reaches all the way to the lower floors. No complimentary water, snacks or even coffee served in the rooms.

The location is fantastic, close to some great shops and restaurants, all within walking distance. If you need them cabs are always available right outside, and the views are awesome!The rooms are great, some are a little small but this is NY so to be expected, but they all have a seating area. In 3 out of our 4 rooms there was only glass between the bathroom (which has no door, only the toilet is closed off) and bedroom so if you are sharing with a friend bear this in mind. One of the rooms did have a blind to block off the 'view' so that is a possibility. The mini bar is the best I have ever seen in a hotel, stocked full of lots of goodies and naughties! Now here is my small but.....there are no tea and coffee making facilities. Now each to their own but I like to have a cup of coffee in the morning without having to get dressed and go downstairs. One morning I was too hungover to move and just wanted coffee and OJ, so I had to call room service, as you can imagine, not the cheapest! What would be perfect is a coffee machine, they can charge for the pods, I'd have no problem with that, I just don't want to get dressed for coffee!We only had breakfast at the restaurant which was good but I have heard from friends in New York that dinner is great there too.All in all a great stay, would I stay again, yes without hesitation but I would be bringing my own kettle and cafetière!","London, United Kingdom","JenLouEm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",31,4.0

The hotel definitely targets the younger hipster crowd that frequents the Meatpacking District with lots of loud partying from the top floor club that spills over into the public areas at weekends. If you fit this demographic you will love it. If not, you will need to hide out in your room on one of the lower floors. Some quirky features like pitch black elevators, a window from the bedroom area into the bathroom and mattresses that are a few inches from the floor. Bed was far too soft for me, but I realize this is a personal preference. Good restaurant but wine servings by the glass were the smallest I have seen and when I ordered a second glass the waiter just topped up my partially empty glass to its former level rather than giving me a full second glass.

Some people have said that the higher rooms are not as quiet as the lower floors because of the club on the roof. I'd have to say that we didn't notice any more noise than usual for a hotel and that was even with a well attended, private party going on up there. The minibar was well stocked and not really outrageously priced on most things. The room was clean and well kept. If you are traveling with family or friends and are on the shy side though, this room place may not be for you. The shower was all glass on two sides and no door. We loved it but things could get kind of awkward if you and your buds are there for a night LOL. In all reality, this place is for couples and partying and it hits it out of the park in those two categories. Front desk staff and the valet attendants were friendly and helpful.

If you want comfort and luxury, it falls short. I stayed in the Empire Suite, which I believe is one of their larger, if not largest rooms. The views is very nice, but the room is not very functional.The bed, is partly on a platform, so you have to walk up to get in on one side, giving you sort of a trapped in feel. It's not the kind of bed conducive to certain activities if you understand what I mean, but it looks ""cool"", along with the bathtub right next to the bed with no privacy - I can deal with that, as again they are trying to be edgy and cool and let you show of your nakedness to the world. What I can't deal with, is the very low lighting. The main bathroom is quite small (by standards of NYC suites) and not well light. The shower also has a see through wall, so again you can show off your body to your BF/GF/spouse/mistress/whomever, though it's a bit smoky the glass. The second bathroom is all but useless. The lighting is low you can barely see yourself in the mirror, and you are basically showering in the dark with just a soft glow...it's by the design. There are a bunch of closely packed leather couches at the foot of the bed, and the walkways are a bit narrow. The room does have one of the best bars I've ever seen in a hotel room. It's clear this room is just designed for drinking, partying, whatever, and cool factor, but comfort factor suffers.The location is great if you want to be around the Meat Packing District, but otherwise, not much else is around there. SoHo is a bit too far of a walk (IMO), and 5th Ave., Broadway, Central Park, etc. you'll need to get a lift. There's a popular roof top bar, but seems it is not clear when or how you can get in (it was private, then it wasn't, then it was, I can't keep track...but just make sure you know the admission policies if you are anticipating going there). Finally, restaurants connected with the hotel are not bad, but are overrated. You're not going here for the food.Overall, good hotel if you're coming to NYC to drink, have fun, hook up...but if you in NYC more for luxury, fine dining, shopping, Broadway, you might want to consider other hotels in more appropriate locations.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","George J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",116,3.0

The Standard hotel is all about style. The atmosphere ist cool and it is a great hotel for visiting New York as its location is convenient and the subway is just a few minutes walk away. Also all the rooms offer a great view over NYC.Everything is sleek and modern. We had a kingsize room on the 17th floor with a view towards the financial district. What a great view! The size of the room is ok and above average for NYC standards. I liked that the room had a bluetooth speaker I could connect my ipod with. Our room had a bath tube from which you where able to enjoy the view.Although the room was on the floor directly under the ""The Top Of The Standard"" bar we didn't hear any noise coming from the bar. BTW check out this bar. The bar itself is worth visiting the hotel. Great ambient and a decent selection of drinks.The staff was very nice and helpful - thanks to Dave and Mike - which can sometimes be a total different story specially in NYC. I inquired about a late checkout and a room on a high floor via email before we arrived but I never got any answer. Thankfully everything was sorted out when we checked in.

Everything about it was spectacular, so it made my boyfriend's birthday weekend go perfectly. But beware, I booked the room through a third party and had some booking issues. Thankfully, The Standard's customer service was so helpful! I booked the Superior King room, and it was so spacious. There was a plumbing issue and someone was able to quickly fix it for us! The only thing I did not like was the layout of the stand up shower and the toilet. It was opened with no door available, not really ideal during the winter time. You really needed to stay underneath the hot water to avoid getting cold. As for the toilet, it was in this separated room. I felt a bit claustrophobic. Despite that, our room was very nice. We had a spectacular view of the high line and the hudson river! Overnight, the noise level was moderate. Which was understandable because of the rooftop nightclub. The Standard altered how to get to the elevator towards the evening, and I assume this was to avoid clubgoers and hotel guests from bumping into one another. Awesome idea. The location around The Standard could have not been better. You have the high line in walking distance, the village is very nice to explore and has plenty of bars opened to keep you entertained. During the winter, The Standard have an ice skating rink for free access for hotel guests! Only need to pay for the skate rental (only $4) but I ended up staying during a nice, warm weekend and all the ice melted. The beer garden and grill are also cool places to try during your stay.

We felt from the beginning that they seemed much more focused on daytrippers and to people visiting the hotel's bar as opposed to their guests. Fleeting, walk in commerce clearly trumps hotel guests who were paying to be there over numerous days and nights. This is a mistake for a hotel that aims to be a destination setting for international travellers. The reception staff weren't welcoming on arrival, which set alarm bells going . . . They were not forthcoming with information about the hotel itself or its amenities at check in - which we found odd - and they offered no insight into nearby dining/shopping/museum destinations when we asked. In fact, they were rude and abrasive any time we engaged with them - which I have to say is most surprising for NYC! Any time I asked them questions over the days we stayed there they appeared summarily bored, and treated myself and my partner as if we shouldn't be bothering them . . . I felt especially bad as my partner had booked the destination as a romantic surprise, and had gone to such effort to book a killer room for us over a busy time of the year.All in all, a beautifully designed hotel - but with terrible staff.","Greater London, United Kingdom","Stephen T L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Greater London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,4.0

The ice machines on the floors don't work and room service takes an hour at 11 PM. There are no restrooms in the lobby. You have to go out, across an outdoor hall to the restaurant, walk across the restaurant and then down a flight of stars. Really? Really. And this is a new building? Yep it sure is.

Overall my stay was very nice - the floor to ceiling windows are incredible and make for excellent early morning wake ups if you're a sun worshipper. The bed is very comfortable (if you like soft, as I do) and the shower is incredible. To be completely honest, my room was showing slight signs of wear and tear (small stain in the carpet and a couple scratches in the mini bar) and one of the staff at the front desk was less than helpful. However, the gentleman that checked me in was very welcoming and room service was reasonably priced and delivered quickly and the waiter was friendly and accommodating. The ice skating rink/ winter plaza outside was also super cozy and a nice way to relax in the evening! (Plus free ice skating after 8 pm for guests!)Would I pay full price in advance to stay here?

Overall, I stayed there for about 60 days over the next 3 months.River-view queen room on 11th floor was my favourite. Spectacular view of the financial district, Hudson river and New Jersey, comfortable tub, and room resembling of a little Studio all contributed to the experience. I also stayed in river-view King room at 13th floor (which was having an even better view, but the bed was definitely too soft), city-view king room at the same floor (pretty dark, too little light getting there through the small window, a bit depressing in the long run) and corner-king (with a panoramic view, although I'd still prefer the river through my window).There are a few misunderstandings, like the ""pool"" is, forgive my choice of words, a pretty small... pond in the club upstairs. When BoomBoom Room (club) is open, the elevators work horribly slow (could easily take up to 5 minutes just to get one). The ""open bathroom"" concept is cool (for couples, not really for broader family), but proves very impractical (taking a shower leaves the whole bathroom floor wet). Beds, especially King ones, can be soft to the point of extreme back pains (and this was for active, working out young people). However, the overall experience was still very good and I would be happy to go back there in the future.In summary: the view was inspiring, the tub and shower - useful to relax after a long day, housekeeping service was excellent, and Kevin C. at the front desk was always kind and ready to help.","London, United Kingdom","3yaku</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",2,4.0

Good facilities at the gym, the bar on the 18th floor is incredible and we had a delicious dinner at the Standard Grill. My only comment would be that for the price (and I know that NY hotel rooms are small) the rooms are small. We were in one of the top of the range ones and even found that small. Only other comment would be that the rooms could have had more personal touches, even just having a notebook and pen in there for example.

The room cleaning was not good enough for a kind of this hotel class. Nothing special in the decoration or furniture. At the same floor we face a lot of problems with noise, smokers and drug users (other guests). The staff was notified several times, but don´t reacts appropriately to solve the problem. And don´t have any sensibility to demonstrate attention or support to family facing a situation like that in their hotel. To expensive and not fancy enough to have a experience like that.

When it arrived it was Swiss cheese (obviously) and not to his taste. He asked for cheddar. Duly requested, and despite having none, the hotel managed to find some. This in a city where shops close at 6pm and 24 hr service just doesn't exist.Why is this relevant to a review of the Standard? Well, the Swiss proudly believe to have the best hoteliers in the world. However, New Yorkers believe they have the vest hotels in the world - evidenced by the fact you have to pay over $400 to stay in anything less than a hovel. And whilst the Swiss can rightly claim their boat. New Yorkers are so far off the mark. In my time in NYC I've stayed in many hotels. From being with the pimps and drug dealers at HoJo's on 8th to the Waldorf. None have been any good. The standard is no exception to this. From arrival this is a lazy hotel. Young staff may make it feel edgy, but what they have in looks they clearly lack in experience. Check in (an out) is a comedy affair. In my case not helped that they managed to lose my bag that I had I left with them for a weekend - it took over 30 minutes to locate during which time communication was terrible.When you do get to the rooms they are tiny and pimped to look like the 1970's. Low on comfort and low on quality. Already looking tired and less than 10 years old, you get little for your money here. You might have guessed I'm not a fan of NYC. This hotel exemplifies all the reasons why I struggle with this city. It is brash, arrogant and dismissive. It lacks any real charm and instead offers a pastiche of what you can expect in the neighbouring bars. The only upside is the excellent grill which is very good. Don't stay but do eat here. That is the only reason this gets 2 stars. ","London, United Kingdom","D4004HFmikeg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",109,2.0

First, the front signage hangs upside down without illumination, making it difficult to find the entrance. Riding the elevator to/from the room gives a rider a vertigo attack.

The bed was not comfortable. The room was not comfortable due to design choices: no shelf in the closet (there's ample room) so you can place things that don't go on hangers; no hooks for your towels; no door on the shower.

Perhaps the managing director ( seriously, sweetie -are you in finance or are you in the service industry) should look into how other managers have responded to negative reviews, particularly the gentleman from the Waldorf Astoria. It's so important to be gracious and sincerely apologetic. And it's crucial to learn from your mistakes and apply those lessons!

It had a great view over the Hudson and I didn't hear any noise all night.The reasons I do not award 5* are the lift system was chaotic --- calling a lift took 5mins+ and once inside it felt like a lottery trying to select the correct floor --- and it feels like the 'cool' is wearing off, it's not as fresh as when it opened and I don't know what they can do to give it the buzz back","London, United Kingdom","PGlovebox</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",37,4.0

Rooms are very clean and most European travelers will find the standard rooms spacious. Restaurant serves a la carte breakfast with a nice selection of juices. Avocado toast with a poached egg is a must. In general there is a hip atmosphere all over the place as the neighborhood is full of restaurants and bars which are popular among the locals. If you are lucky like me, you may come across Diane von Furstenberg! The DVF boutique and headquarters are just around the corner in the same street.

I felt like I had helpers in the car with me when I pulled up...also no waiting for other cars to move. I was able to just pull up, and the rest was taken care of! Onto the front desk where Colleen, who has now helped me check in twice, literally feels like a friend I have known for years. She even remembered to ask about my dog that I briefly spoke about on my last stay! The hotel does it's best to upgrade you when available and is incredibly accommodating to any requests. There is not a bad room in the house- floor to ceiling windows and stunning city views. The rooftop bar, the Boom Boom Room is one of the prettiest bars I have ever seen (note, they have a dress code and ripped denim is not permitted!- dress your best, and you will want to when you see what everyone else is wearing, including the hostesses). Room service options are fantastic and the breakfast is one of my favorites (Simple scrambled farm fresh eggs, w/ Gruyere and country bread). In the winter season the ice skating rink is a holiday favorite and in the warmer months the hotel sits ON TOP OF the Highline which is a NYC favorite for locals and tourists- I lived in Manhattan for 8 years and still love everything about the highline. You can walk right next door to the Whitney Museum, and always visit the outdoor rooftop bar with insane views right on site of the hotel. The hotel has a super hip vibe that makes you feel swanky every time you even get in the elevator. I Highly recommend this property, and thank you again to the team that makes it that way! Note: If you are a last minute traveler, download their one night stand app for amazing last minute deals! You might even get a room with city views and HUGE tub!

My stay was made significantly sweeter given the stellar customer service, complimentary upgrades, comped dinner from the maître d in the outdoor section of the living room (summer), and bottles of champagne. I especially love the late check-outs, river view, Highline view, and close proximity to culture/clothes/art/food and fun. The Whitney Museum is a stones throw away and visible from south facing rooms. Note: There is also a $2 Friends of the Highline donation/tax charged each night of your occupancy, for a great cause. However you can ask that they remove that donation if you would prefer not to participate. Tips: 1. Consider their App ""the standard: one night standard"" to lock in the best deep discounts for same day purchased rooms after 3pm. 2. If you have noise sensitivities, consider lower floors.

The location is very good, situated within the Meatpacking District close to Chelsea Market and Hudson River. The Hotel rises on 17 floors with a well known roof top bar on the 18th floor. The rooms are rather small for the price paid and the decoration is willingly old style which didn't impress me much. I can mention though that the bath tub is big, the bed very comfortable and if you are on the right side of the hotel you can have an impressive view on the financial district with it's skyscrapers and One World Tower.The facilities of the hotel are overall nice, with a German Biergarten and two other restaurants that serve from breakfast to dinner. I was surprised however that breakfast only starts at 7am which I find very late for a business hotel. If you have the chance go up to the top floor bar that has impressive views 360°. Unfortunately during our stay the bar was closed for 4 consecutive nights due to private events which also led to the shutdown of 2 out of the 4 elevators, which was a real nuisance.Depending on who is in charge staff can go from very friendly to plainly bored and apathic. As an example on my last day I asked for an extension of the checkout from noon to 1 as I then left to the airport. After literally yawning at me the receptionist told me the best she could do is to extend to 12.30 which obviously was of no help at all.As mentioned in the title the Hotel can be very noisy. As I was staying on the 15th floor I had all the music noise from the top floor bar as well as surrounding noises coming from the hallway and the neighbouring rooms. Fortunately I was so jetlagged that I still could sleep but be aware that the place is noisy.Overall I found my experience average and I wouldn't go back if I had the choice as the price was quite steep for what we got.","Mexico City, Mexico","Werner H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mexico City, Mexico</strong>",16,3.0

Everything from the design of the rooms to the labyrinth of amenities at the high line location make this a paradise for those visiting New York. Even as a native who has lived here for 7 years the high line location never gets old. The Grill has some of the best food I've ever tasted. The Biergarten is the perfect afterwork hangout for casual drinks and of course lets not forget the two crown jewels Le Bain and Boom Boom which have dominated NYC nightlight since the hotel opened in 2009. All and all it can be relaxing, luxurious, wild or any combination of the three. It's a fantastic hotel and I would hightly recommend. Even though I've visited the hotel for social occasions countless times, I only recently had the opportunity to actually stay in one of the rooms as a guest. I last minute treated my boyfriend to a weekend staycation and got an amazing rate using the standard's app (I would highly recommend downloading for spontaneous stays!). The service was incredible and it ended up being one of the best weekends I've had in ages. Monique in concierge was wonderfully helpful in setting us up with our room. When asked for recommendations for good wine she helped us select the perfect Malbec and when our bathtub broke (oops!) mid-stay she had it fixed in the flick of a wrist.

Wanted to try something different - and The Standard certainly is different. Other reviews are remarkably accurate about how the hotel caters to the younger/hip/scene. This hotel feels like the 'authentic' version of a trendy hotel, vs. the W which is the more corporate counterpart. That having been said, our overall experience was just ""meh"" for a number of reasons. Rooms are small. We live in NY - this was not a surprise. But the whole ""bed on the floor"" was a surprise - and would not be welcome if you have trouble 'getting up."" Views were great. As others have commented, be sure to draw your shades if you want privacy - otherwise, you are on display for the High Line. Overall furnishings were fine. As some have commented - rooms are nearly ""all white"" - unfortunately, the housekeeping/attention to detail missed a significant stain on our comforter/duvet, which detracted from our experience. Room noise was significant - we were on a low floor (5) and you could hear hallway noise far too easily in the room. Big miss was lack of in-room coffee. I have seen remarks on other TA comments from hotel management informing people how 'there are many coffee bars nearby.' That's a weak response from management. Aspiring four star+ hotels should have in-room coffee. Full stop. I had to wake up early to jaunt outside to get my wife her morning cup of java - which I did not mind, but which was inconvenient. Also must comment on the dark elevators - would be great if you were drunk or on mind-altering drugs, but otherwise are just stupid - you can't see the buttons and more than a few people have shared my view ""what are they trying to hide with dark elevators""? (e.g. lack of attention to detail/housekeeping). Hotel vibe is definitely ""we are the cool kids"" - which is fine if you need/want that.

The rooms are warmly/modernly decorated but totally unworkable for anyone over 70 pounds or 3 feet tall. Bed is on the floor (no legs) so getting in and out is very difficult (esp for older folk who have to get up a lot during the night). The small couch is only a foot from the ground. The single chair could not hold my 13 year old grandson. The shower/wash room has no door on it so no privacy. The bathroom is so teenie I hit my knees on the wall when I use it. This is a 'hip' neighborhood, which means there are noisy drunk people out at all hours of the night. Unless you are one of those folk, get a room at a high level. While there are some decently sized rooms, most are so small that two adults can't be up and around without knocking into each other.

Mostly older couples but quite a few older singles traveling together.We were hoping for a hotel long on service and even longer on ambiance. I'm afraid we were sadly disappointed. The hotel staff was less than helpful, and seemed more interested in catering to their ""Hip"" night club crowd. During the day it was pretty much a very normal hotel with few amenities. But at night it turns into a very busy meat market. The lights in the halls and by the elevators are turned way down and one of the two elevators are commandeered for the night club on the roof. Leaving long waits in the dimly lit area for hotel guests. The biggest surprise was in the rooms. The bathtub is raised to the height of the bed, and is completely glassed in. Therefore you shower in front of whomever happens to be in the room. This was not appreciated by most of the members of our art group as their were just roommates. The hotel actually advertises the fact that it's looking for people to hook up.This is from their website. When to One Night Stand Oh, the one-night stand, that erotic carpe diem. It capitalizes the here, the now, and the maybe-once-tomorrow-morning. But like all of life’s adventures, there are no guarantees how it will turn out. Fatal Attraction-type scenarios notwithstanding, what are some of the elements that help you pull the trigger. Is it really worth it? Will someone better come along?

A lot of terrible things happened and they always talk to us as if they were doing us a favor. Kevin, the night shift attendant, made me stay 30 minutes apart from my husband in the roof top bar because he was just so arrogant and reluctant to help us understanding what was the problem with the elevators. Last but not least: we paid $200 for a late check out and our key didn't work all the 4 times we try to use it. It could be a simple thing to a hotel to solve but they always met us with arrogance.

Exit the elevator and i didn't like the musty smell. King bed with one side against a wall bordered by funky fabric I wouldn't touch and a dingy bedspread. The best thing- a bathroom with a large picture window overlooking the room, which overlooks the street. I'm not into being on display when I shower.

Overall they do not appear happy in their work are not what we've come to know of hospitality professionals. They really don't care. It occurred to us that this is a culture fostered by hotel management who, apparently, are far more concerned with the patrons in the nightspots, bars and restaurants rather than the hotel guests. As paying guests we weren't permitted access to hotel bars due to private functions more than once. The room we had was form over function.

Now for the room review - I got a deluxe king river view and my girlfriend got the larger corner room version for herself and her daughter. The extra space in the larger room is wasted space and the layout is odd. Not worth the extra money. They actually liked my room much better. Beds are very low, they are on the floor platform style beds. They were all white and clean. Housekeeping did a great job. The mini bar guy going up and down the halls yelling mini bar drove me to drink! My friends room had a weird shower room that had the sink in the shower so if you are not alone you will be showering in an open space while someone else is doing their makeup and trying not to get wet. That was not the case in my room. My shower was separate. Just another reason to book the deluxe king and not the corner room. The river view was beautiful.

I absolute love the brand. I am a huge fan. This hotel has so much to offer--a rooftop bar, nightclub, casual (but quintessential) brunch spot--and my favorite--a beer garden with games! We had a few hiccups with the reservations team, whom I found to be quite curt and unaccommodating, so when we checked in, I had set the bar low (even though as I mentioned I love the brand.)However, everything changed the moment we checked in. The service was such a nice mix of casual professionalism. My favorite staff member was the housekeeper on the 10th floor. She always greeted us, and made such a nice effort to clean the room at the appropriate time for us. I will definitely be back. I love the modern, fun style of this hotel. It is the best location in the city--right down the block from the Chelsea Market and right over the High Line. By the way, this is not a family hotel. You'll want to leave the kids at home.

The fitness center, with a panoramic view of the Hudson River, is one of the best I've used in any hotel. From cocktails and steaks at The Standard Grill, people watching with wines and small plates in the Plaza to scene stealing views and fantastic (but rather expensive) drinks at The Top of the Standard, there's something for everyone. Even the shop next to the lobby is properly curated with everything from pieces by Buff Monster to Warby Parker sunglasses to other 'toys', if you get my drift. It's all supremely well done.

We arrived at 9pm and checked in. The guy on reception then ran through the various bars and restaurants available at break neck speed as a queue was forming. When I asked about using the roof top bar I was told after 945pm entrance was at the door mans discretion. We used the bar one night and it was a great view, great vibe and entry was no problem at all, however I would expect, as a guest paying $400 per night that this would be automatic entry and not up to a doorman! We upgraded our room to a senior king and cannot complain about the size of the room or bed which was super comfy. But again I did expect complimentary bottled water and tea/coffee making facilities. I get your in NYC and everyone orders takeout everything, but sometimes it's just a nice home comfort to have a cuppa in your bed. The room service charge was only $2 for a coffee but then they add another $9 on for bringing it up to your room. There was no wardrobe to speak off, merely a small rail and 3 shelves fitted into a wall indentation and then covered with a curtain! No other drawers or storage space so my lived out of his case for 5 days. The room was very clean but I was cold and wax told by reception that the heating hadn't been switched on so just gave me an extra blanket. The bathroom wall was a panel of glass so although it didn't bother us, as we've been married for 18 years, those with a little more modesty maybe feel slightly awkward taking a shower whilst they look directly into the bedroom! The loo, thankfully is behind a door. Although it's so small you felt like your sitting in a cupboard! We were never greeted with any kind of recognition from reception during our stay and felt the staff were just too cool for school with a big helping of unfriendly arrogance layered on top.

We didn't really know what to expect on arrival, and had no real expectations. After entering in through the large revolving door out front, we walked into the beautiful and modern front lobby and we were instantly impressed. Our expectations were set high upon walking in, but our dealing with the staff of The Standard blew our expectations out of the water. We were helped at the front desk by Regina and I can honestly say that she is a huge reason our visit was exceptional. She was immediately super kind and nice to us and showed a genuine interest in us having a good time. Regina took her time in finding is the perfect room, asking what we'd like and making her search for our room tailor made. Regina sat behind the desk for a solid five minutes before looking up at us and telling us that she's going to make our stay ""Unforgettable"". She was not lying.Our room was on the 25th floor, with a 180 degree view overlooking the Hudson. A view from which you could see the WTC from one window , and the Empire State Building from the other window on the far side. There was even a bathtub placed in the centre of the room (Thanks Regina!) We were blown away. The room was phenomenal. It was beautiful and was kept in a very good state, very clean and fully equipped with everything you could need.The staff were all so kind and were always on hand for anything we needed, and were there for us when we needed advice on where to get a slice of pizza late in the night!Our night at the Standard was truly unforgettable, and I've been recommending it to anyone who will listen.

We decided to split our trip up and stay in different areas of the city, but this was definitely the highlight for us and our second stop in NYC. We arrived on a Friday night, check-in was easy and our room was a far more comfortable size than our previous hotel uptown. Success!We wanted to head out and explore the area, so I jumped in the shower. The bath was enormous, easily big enough for two, but I was in a hurry and needed a quick shower. I was really surprised because the pressure was at the lower end of scale and wasn't coming out from a portion of the shower head, especially compared to our previous but more basic hotel shower. My partner took a look at it and also thought thay something must be wrong with it, and called the front desk to ask them to check it. The response was somewhat nonchalant (that's just how it is), however an engineer would check it in 30 mins. We went off on our merry way and figured that the engineer would see the problem and hopefully fix it.Upon our return, my partner and I asked about it at the front desk but were basically fobbed off again. We were bitterly disappointed. Long story short, a manager at the hotel found out that we were pretty miffed about the response we received and contacted us first thing Sunday morning. She arranged for us to be moved so that the shower could be fixed and was incredibly apologetic. The hotel went above and beyond to let us know that we were indeed valued and that they wanted us to enjoy our stay. And that we did.Although the start was a bit frustrating at the time, The Standard more than redeemed themselves. We had an amazing stay and it's definitely an experience that I will remember fondly for the rest of my life. The views are spectacular, however if you book one of the more basic rooms (which still have great views), you can still enjoy the full 360 degree views from the bar, nightclub, or rooftop. If you can afford a room with a better view, do it. It's worth the money but you won't want to leave the room to do anything else. It's comfortable enough that you don't have to!The room service food is also fantastic, but there is a plethora of restaurants and other options nearby including the Chelsea Markets. It's obviously right on the Highline but you are also right across from a great running/walking/cycling path along the Hudson that leads down to Battery Park. It's also not too far from the Subway, making it easy to travel uptown if you want to. Staying in the Meatpacking District is a much more pleasant and authentic NY experience than if you stay further uptown, and I would also recommend The Standard for this reason.Overall we had a fantastic stay, oh and as a balletomane I also loved the Prokofiev in the lift!",Australia,"ACM8882</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Australia</strong>",8,5.0

Tables and chairs could have come from the 70s but were clearly very modern. I upgraded to a higher room so I would get the best views possible and the Floor to ceiling Windows looking out over the Empire State certainly did not disappoint. The shower has a glass wall next to the bed so make sure you are sharing with someone you know intimately as there really is no room for privacy in this respect (the toilet is behind a closed door). The minibar and larder was very well stocked with nibbles and drinks to cover pretty much anything you might need - beyond that room service was on hand at a moments notice.The staff were really friendly and efficient. room service was delivered promptly and the food was to a very high standard.The room was spotless with plenty of clean fluffy bath towels (4) and the bed was really comfortable.The in room technology is intuitive and I had no problems instantly pairing my iPhone to play music while I showered and changed to go out.The rooftop bar is superb for views and I made sure I had time to sit drinking a few vodka martinis as the sun went down. I dressed up a bit to go up there as previous reviews mention that that there is a dress code. You don't need to go over the top as some people were fairly casually dressed - just use your common sense.I loved the area around the hotel which felt very safe, bustling with a youngish crowd in the wide range of cafes, bars and restaurants.The High Line is also on the doorstep (as the hotel name suggests) and is definitely worth a look. The converted railway line now feels like an urban garden with great views suddenly appearing of the city as you make your way around it. It was a hot sunny day and so ice creams helped make the experience all the more enjoyable.I will 100% stay here again - Very much recommended.","Leeds, United Kingdom","768neale</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",10,5.0

I'd walked past the hotel on previous trips to New York and really wanted to treat myself for a special birthday. I was lucky enough that my parents and friends were able to join me. Firstly the good things. Our room was on the 17th floor with stunning views of the Empire State building. The bed was massive (although we had a superior King room) and an interesting shower and bath on full view of your room buddy and most of people in the buildings opposite if you make the mistake of assuming the rooms have tinted floor to ceiling glass... be warned, they don't! The rest of the hotel though was a total disappointment. The service from staff was lacklustre at best and just damn rude at worst. If you dare to complain they just smile at you and don't even apologise. Basically if your face doesn't fit your not welcome and they have no problem in telling you. The lifts after 9pm even stop going to the top floor so you can't possibly enter the roof bar. Not that the staff told us this until they escorted us down from the terrace like we were criminals, because we dared to walk up one flight of stairs to get to the bar!! We simply assumed the lift was broken. When we did finally get to the terrace at 5pm the following evening we were met with equally unfriendly staff who spoke to my Dad in a really patronising Manor saying ""just so you know, you are not allowed to move the chairs"" because he was kind enough to pull up a chair for my friend. You can see from my photo how empty the place was! Well, just so you know your hotel is pretentious and you have zero idea of how to offer any service to your customers. Basically, save your money. Stay at the W in union square instead and walk the 20 mins to get to the meatpacking district.

I wish we'd have stayed in the Air BNB as the service from the owners was awesome despite them not even being there IE: completely the opposite of the hotel. I have never stayed somewhere so pretentious as The Standard Hotel. It has an air of 'we're The Standard, if you don't stay here we'll fill your room easily so aren't bothered about our service'. The rooms are small and weird. If you're staying with friends and are openly happy with showering naked in view of the entire bedroom then this is the hotel for you. Thankful the toilet/WC had its own door. We did have to move rooms on the first night though as the tiles had been laid away from the plughole and were draining shower water towards the door instead (not an easy fix and people 'have complained of that before’) Have no fear though, you can always make things better by having a drink to take the edge off...if you can get served that is. We even found paying our bill difficult and could have easily walked off without begging to part with our money. The service was so bad at the outside bar that we complained to the hotel reception. After telling the whole story I was asked to tell it again… to ‘her manager’ (yawn) who gave us 1 free bar token for the Beer Garden (you can't pay cash) to entice us back in there. As guests are allowed to go to the roof top bar until 9pm (rock and roll, before they switch off the lift access to their super pretentious trendy club for the evening) we thought we'd give it a go but be warned if you have a large group you're not allowed to move the chairs and sit together. Who wants to sit together anyway hey? I'd love to comment on the room service but I was not prepared to pay the $7 room service fee for delivery and we didn't eat at the hotel to assess the quality food. All in all, not impressed. They need to focus more on customer service, realising that everyone's money is a good as the next persons regardless of whether your face fits with their required profile. Maybe when I finally get the £1200 hold that's still sitting on my credit card back I can book a better hotel in NYC",,Lucy D,5,1.0

Had friends who stayed on Hudson view side (more expensive) - great view, but mentioned that the room was very warm each afternoon from the sun. In-room meal service was excellent & quick each morning. Note: Standard has an app that lists available rooms beginning at 3pm each day. No guarantee of room, but ""worst"" you would get is a queen bed. Although I already had my reservations thru front desk months before, I checked out app pricing and availability.

The layout was sort of weird to me as the bed was pretty much lying on the ground and the shower (which was right next to the bed basically) was all-glass and one could see into it from anywhere in the room! Regardless, comfortable room and I did enjoy my time in it (mostly working).One more thing about the room: the view was FANTASTIC! I'm not sure if the hotel is situated where all rooms have great views, but mine was awesome. I was on the 16th floor, so ask for a room on a higher floor of you like cool city views.If you like to use hotel gyms like I do, this hotel has a good one -- and it has a great view of lower Manhattan and New Jersey.There's a restaurant on site (really 2, sort of), but it's hard to navigate. You actually have to go outside of the hotel to enter the restaurant -- which isn't that much of a hassle I guess, but is sort of inconvenient. It was PACKED the entire time I was at the hotel, so I just didn't want to deal with it. You can get the entire menu via room service, so I went that route.As far as the ""other restaurant,"" they have a German Beer Garden (The Standard Biergarten"") which I would've liked to checked out, but it was PACKED and full of hipsters and uppity folks, so I passed.The hotel is located in the Meatpacking district, which was a cool area to walk around and check out. If that's your thing, then FYI.The only issue I had with the hotel from a service standpoint was when I checked out. I had to be at a press conference for a film that started the noon of the day I was checking out. I called the front desk, asked for a late check out and they obliged. When I got back from the press conference, I asked a dude at the front desk to update my key (it wouldn't work after Noon) as I had a late checkout and need to go get my stuff. This guy was, frankly, rude and insinuated that I was going to be charged for another day for trying to check out after the official check out time. Regardless, the hipster dude reluctantly gave me and updated key (without charging me) so I could get retrieve my bags.Bottom line: This is a nice hotel in a cool location, but it's NOT for everyone. If you like trendy hotels frequented by hipsters and folks too cool for school, then this is ABSOLUTELY the place for you. I wouldn't use this hotel for business travel, nor would I stay here during a family vacation.One more word of advice: one of the top floors turns into a dance club at night during weekends. The noise didn't affect me, but it did a few colleagues of mine.","Little Elm, Texas","60_B-Ram</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Little Elm, Texas</strong>",19,4.0

The suggestion came from a newyorker friend that usually go to The top of the Standard (their roof top bar).The design of the hotel is appropriate to the dynamic area of the MeatPacking distrinct. The view is precious and the block was very entrateining for our age (30's). Problems:- room dirty af (see my picture): the bed is on the carpet, under the bed you find full of hair, caps, menu, organic leftover and whatever you can dream about if you had a stay there in couple. DISGUSTING!!- very unsafe, people from outside use the lift to reach not only the rooftop, but also the other people rooms. Even if the lift works with a badge, I personally saw attendant alloweding people in the floor that are supposed to be only for guests. I was in room 1001 and on the side of my room there was a party in a regular room with about 20 teenager drunk af. It took three hours and four calls at the reception to get rid of them.- after those complaints, a manager told us we got two on five nights discount. At the checkout time nothing was settled on the bill and we had to argue till the check-out time. The guy there was keeping on smiling to us, that was very irritating.- everybody is perfoming a very fake understanding attitude, all they do is smiling to you, but they don't have knowledge of professionalism. - after 7 days, I am still waiting for an estimate cost of a party my Company is thinking to host there, but of course they seem to be too busy for answering.- my credit card still has 2000 dollars deposit for a stay of five nights with a prepayment of almost 300 dollars.

Its in meat packing, which is a trendy area with a ton of bars/restaurants and shopping. It's also pretty centrally located for accessing the rest of the city. What's really great about the location though is it isn't mobbed with a ton of hotels like midtown. Instead, it felt like I was in a real neighborhood but with the comfort of a hotel. The room was also gorgeous with a view that impressed even my friends who live in the city. There is also a certain cache that comes with saying you are staying at The Standard and it definitely got me some eye raises whenever anyone asked where I was for the weekend. However, what really set my stay apart was the staff at the hotel. The concierges Tim and Andrea were amazing. I normally don't bother to take advantage of concierges since their suggestions usually consist of checking out a museum and telling me to grab dinner at TGI Fridays. But both Tim and Andre helped get me into some impressive events. Their knowledge/connections also extended to the entire city and I got some really great tips on places to see in the village and SoHo. Bottom line, if you stay at The Standard take advantage of the concierge. My stay at the hotel did have a slight snafu: a malfunctioning AC unit that took a bit of time to fix. However, what earned the Standard 5-stars was the graciousness of the staff in helping to resolve the issue. Kevin at the front desk was deeply apologetic for the inconvenience and made sure I was well taken care of for the rest of my trip. It was this level of thoughtfulness and sincerity that made The Standard worthwhile. There are lots of hotels in NY with pretty views and nice rooms but this was my first time at a hotel in the city in which all employees seemed genuinely concerned about the quality of my stay.

It isn't perfect, it isn't cheap but the pluses more than make up for the minuses. Plus: The views are the best in NYC. I was on the 13th floor with views over the river and the skyline. The room I had was one of the bigger ones so I was very lucky and was well looked after. The reception staff are amazing and the daily banter was a delight. They were also super helpful and great at making recommendations for fun things to do. The rooftop bar LeBain has stunning views. The Standard Grill had the best burger I had in NYC. The hotel is not stuffy or formal so if you want 5* formality then this is not for you! Cons: The Barstaff in LeBain were some of the rudest people I have ever met in my life and the fact that I didn't leave a tip in USA as they were so rude, is testament to how rude they were. They seem to think they are too cool to serve guests.The room was a little tired in places and the hotel felt in places like it could use a revamp. Some of the evening staff were less friendly than the day and as others have stated the door policy on Top of the Standard is crazy that guests of the hotel can't go up there directly and have to queue after 10pm and are subject to dress police. Le Bain is less dressy but it does attract half of NYC on a hot day to the roof which makes trying to get into the main lift a pain as they all go up to roof and return few hours later drunk. Perhaps guests and non guests could have different entrances all the time as they do at the weekend. As others have stated - lack of coffee machine in the room or even water is a shame. Given that really basic hotels do this - this is a big miss for me.

It's all too easy to throw back the curtains and realise that you've just featured in half a dozen tourist snaps. We were forewarned, but even so it was hard to remember to draw the drapes before disrobing. We had a corner room on a low floor and the views were spectacular - sunset over the Hudson and a great view downtown. I love that there is so much light in the rooms and seeing the roofscape of West Village was great too.There is a funky, young vibe to this hotel (the elevator was positively spooky), with a sunset crowd on the rooftop that wasn't our demographic. There is also a more formal cocktail bar with jazz, but we were put off by the ""reserved"" signs on all the tables and the clear indication that we would have to slip someone a substantial tip to be seated. Given the high price of the hotel room we didn't feel like springing extra just to sit in the hotel bar. Some really nice chilling spaces on the ground floor, and both the informal bar/juice area and restaurant were very popular. We preferred to wander off and eat in smaller local places - Mary's Fish Camp on Charles and W4th is great.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","AMHEDIN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",14,5.0

And location-wise, it was. But I definitely do not recommend this hotel if you are trying to get work done in between meetings. It's loud, the walls are terribly thin, and you will find yourself completely exhausted from lack of sleep. Let's start with check-in. I had flown all day, was tired, and ready for bed. Yes, I would say I was little disheveled for such a pretentious hotel, but does that really deserve such a rude welcome? The two greeters only looked at me long enough to see that I probably didn't belong there (at least that's how they made me feel) and was promptly ignored. The lady at the front desk was luke warm to me at best. Fine. Just get me to my room so I don't have to deal with your snotty attitude. Now, the rooms are tasteful and fun. They are small, but this is NY and I wouldn't complain about the size at all. I would even say that would be nice for two people, as long as you don't mind your companion seeing you shower. I hate how dark and damp most NY bathrooms are, so as odd as it is to have your shower in the middle of your room, it was great to have some natural light in the bathroom (though you should draw your shades because people CAN see in the windows during the day). I'm also a huge fan of having the toilet in a separate space. It just feels more sanitary. Back to sleep quality. It's TERRIBLE. I was placed in a room by the elevators, on the 4th floor. All night long (and for my 4 night stay) I heard the elevators go up and down. They give you earplugs, but they did nothing to help. I ended up downloading a white noise app on my phone which helped me finally get to sleep, but should I really need to do that at a nice hotel?. To add to the elevator noise, I got to experience lovely THUMP THUMP of the club upstairs. Yup, the Boom Boom Room is on the 18th floor and I was on the 4th. I could STILL hear it. To make matters worse, whenever the room above me used their shower, it'd hear a ear-piercing LOUD noise from the water and pipes. That was fun at 6am. This hotel is $500 a night and I couldn't sleep hardly at all! Absolutely unacceptable. Other positives and negatives: beds and pillows are good quality and internet worked perfectly. Room service was fast, but food was just okay. The room staff (housecleaning, mini bar attendant, and room service) were all exceptionally friendly and helpful- maybe they should teach their front desk staff the same manners. To be fair, if you are 20something, have expensive shoes, and want a place to party for a weekend, this is your hotel. You'll love it and have fun. If you are just trying to get a good night's sleep and get some work done, stay elsewhere. ","Sunnyvale, CA","maria1012</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunnyvale, CA</strong>",32,2.0

A block is normal during checkin procedure but since my accomodation was pre paid, it was not necessary to do such a high blockage. It is always beneficial to tell the guest what they will do with their card. I complained and they said the blockage will be released in 5 days. Its 12 working days after my checkout (15 working days when all the problems was sorted and the lady at the reception said she will release it. Still blocked. Called them upon this issue, felt like i was talking to a zombie, no emotion or sympathy or urgency to sort this matter.2. Staff said they will get back to me, they didn't. Nothing worse than saying that you will do something and not doing it.3. Can't distinguish between staff and guest. Trying to be trendy and hip but just seems unprofessional.4. One night I went to reception to settle my laundry bill. Was asked if I wanted to settle with cash or credit. Seeing it was a small bill, I settled by cash. Then I realised he only showed me the bill for one of my laundry (I used laundry service twice).

The usual room rate was upwards of $400-$500. Upon arrival, the valets were friendly. None of the attractive front desk personnel, also with pleasant demeanors, looked a day over the age of 24. We stayed on the 13th or 14th floor. One floor-to-ceiling window facing north. Breathtaking, I'm-the-Queen-of-the-World-type views of the skyline and water to our left, with the Highline park immediately below. Btw, love the park, although the heavy crowds at times make it hard to move, much less jog. Forget about jogging there. Loved the nautical-inspired décor of the room (hand railings on the wall along the room's perimeter, white tables and carpet, shiny wood accents and walls). The ""rain shower"" is located almost in the middle of the room, with fully transparent glass on either side. Fun and sexy, if you don't mind the lack of privacy. A unique shower experience that I haven't had anywhere else. By far, my favorite feature was the video installation in the hotel's dark elevator. The video is a mesmerizing, colorful swirl of clips of pop culture (animals and actors from movies and art). I used the treadmill at the many-mirrored gym. It has a lot of equipment, weights, and decent cardio machines. BEAUTIFUL views facing directly toward the water, the city, and New Jersey (?). At nighttime, we dressed up and at an early hour (10:30 pm) we attempted to gain access to the hotel's nightclub. Alas, at the door to the club's elevator, we were told by the hostess with a fake English accent that ""there's a list"" and we were denied entry for not being on the list, even though we were hotel guests. Other hotel employees had recommended the club, saying that it offers guest access. I didn't mind not getting in, because I wanted to check out other bars and clubs in the area. Not a family-friendly set-up, obviously, and it didn't matter to us. We saw one family during our brief stay. This hotel's intended clientele seems to be trendy young and young-ish adults with money. Obviously the hotel's location is superb. You really can't do any better. The NYC experience is about so much more than the stunning views seen from chic hotel rooms, though. Given the high-end rates at this place, other options should be considered. If you're a tourist of any kind, then - quite easily - you could find another suitably nice hotel in a good location in Manhattan for half the price, and spend the cost savings on delicious food, shopping, museums, a show, table service at a club, whatever.

I have to admit I was a little apprehensive about booking my stay-cation at this lofty hotel in such a populated area but the second I pulled up I knew it would be a night to remember. I proceed to check in where I was greeted by Colleen at the front desk who was handling an outright obnoxious patron who clearly taking out his frustration with world on anyone that would listen. I watched her handle the customer who was not letting up such professionalism. When it was my turn I walked up, she greeted me as if she had not just had the customer from HELL. I said my name and was so tempted to plead my case for a better room but I didn't want to be a nag so I waited for here to proceed with the process. She look at my ID and said wait is it your birthday and I replied yes my 30th, she wished me Happy Birthday and even went a little step further. ""She said ""I switched things up for you here your room keys."" To my surprise not only did she upgrade me from a Queen Deluxe to a King Corner Suite she also sent up a bottle of Prosecco which was the cherry on top. I soaked in the tub and sipped Prosecco all night. Thanks Colleen you definitely made my 30th a night to remember.",,Chenelle B,0,4.0

My wedding present was a night's stay after their City Hall marriage. I'm a downtown/neighborhood gal and wanted them to have the best the area has to offer. I knew The Standard to be the most fun( I have enjoyed their restaurants and bars) but their treatment from Welcome to room upgrade to wine waiting in the room , was beyond all expectations possible.  I had mentioned in my reservation through my beloved Bookings, that it was their wedding night and then said it again at the Checkin with the terrific and charming Andrea Aslo, in concert with the new and lovely Kevin. Andrea started out wishing congratulation to the Brides. He then said he was pleased to offer an upgrade. I was so very thrilled , but I had no idea what was awaiting us! As the doors opened the first thing we saw was a spa tub with a window on the Hudson. Then a turn of the head left, floor to ceiling views of downtown to the Statue of Liberty and turn to the north, city skyline. Carmen Rodriguez of Customer Relations, left a beautiful card wishing The Brides happiness, with a bottle of rose wine with 2 glasses.... Spectacular hardly covers it! I am so beyond impressed that a place that could coast on cool went out of their way to celebrate the love of complete strangers.

It was such an amazing experience - our room was really stylish and had a jaw-dropping view of the High Line and the Empire State. It felt like a really special, cool place - far too cool for this pair of nerdy brits! With the exception of one incredibly rude bouncer at the Top of the Standard bar, the service we received from everyone we came across at this hotel was great - very friendly and polite, especially the nice lady in the shop and the team at the front desk. After waiting a very short time to get in to the Top of the Standard, we headed into the bar for some cocktails before dinner. We were stopped at the inner door to the bar by a bouncer who seemed appalled that I wanted to keep my handbag with me whilst we had a drink and treated us with such contempt that we couldn't quite believe it! And this is coming from a Londoner! He was concerned that I might hang my bag on some of their furniture apparently. I can't say being berated about this in front of a crowd of other customers was the highlight of our evening. Such a stinky, unnecessary attitude which really didn't fit in with the rest of our experience. My handbag and I were 'allowed' inside to get a drink but I felt so hacked off we ended up leaving after a couple of minutes. We visited Le Bain instead and watched the sunset with a few drinks which was great fun and then had dinner at the Standard Grill, which apart from some sandy oysters was yummy. Loved the decor of all of the little bar and cafe areas that were dotted around. It was a great base for exploring Chelsea and the Meatpacking district and we would definitely stay here again. We had to leave at 5am the next morning to catch a flight and one of the staff on duty grabbed us a cab and took all of our luggage out to it for us whilst we checked out - this really took the stress out of the early morning departure and we appreciated it a lot.

The Queen deluxe rooms are small but they got a design who could satisfied many. Despite the relatively new and modern construction, the acoustic is not great, you hear everything. The rooftop, the lifts, people walking in the corridor or having parties in their rooms (Frieze week) I'll avoid to stay in rooms close to the lift hall.

This hotel came highly recommended by a friend (RIP, Paul) who had designed the landscaping for the High Line, so when my fiance finally agreed to go back to NYC for a visit (he hates cities and crowds), I knew I wanted to stay in a neighborhood far enough from Times Square that he could see a different side of the city. I've always loved Chelsea, the Village, SoHo & Tribeca, and he's a water lover, so this hotel's location right between Chelsea and the Meatpacking District, with Hudson River views, was just perfect for us. But I had read some of the online reviews and was a little apprehensive that it would be too stuffy or aloof for us, particularly since it was noted as one of the trendiest hotels in one of the hottest, hippest neighborhoods in the city and we're not 20-somethings. Boy, was I wrong! We couldn't have felt more welcome. The warm, friendly service started when I totally screwed up our reservation and discovered a few hours before we were due to arrive that I had accidentally cancelled our reservation at this hotel and had accidentally booked us at their sister hotel in the East Village. Cameron, the reservation agent I spoke with, kindly offered to re-book us at The Standard High Line without a cancellation fee, even though the error was totally my mistake. The corner king room I had originally reserved wasn't available at the last minute though, only a standard queen room was left. She noted my request for an upgrade, and when we arrived, Monique, who promptly greeted us at check-in, provided an upgrade to a deluxe queen room (at full cost, of course), which at least had the Hudson River view I had wanted, along with a huge soaking tub. That tub turned out to be a highlight for my fiance and me! Monique also helped us with walking directions and patiently and politely answered our questions about the hotel and its amenities. We found all of the hotel staff to be incredibly warm and welcoming, from the nighttime security officer stationed by the elevators (you need a room key to enter the area after dark), to the various front desk personnel, bellmen, daytime security officers and the bar and restaurant staff. One night, the ""Living Room"", as the lobby area bar is called, was completely full, so we asked if we could sit on the couches in the main hotel lobby area with our drinks. Not only was this perfectly fine, but the bar staff told us to help ourselves to seats and they sent a server right over to take our order and bring us our drinks there! Our deluxe queen room was small, but quite adequate and clean, with great views of the Hudson River, the High Line, and lower Manhattan, including One World Trade, from the floor-to-ceiling windows. Be aware, the beds are low and the shower is European-style, so the entire bathroom is the shower stall. However, the rain-type of shower head and a glass insert between the sink and shower kept items on the sink from getting soaked. Also, there are wooden louvers between the bathroom and bed/sitting area, which do not close all the way down to the tub level and there is no door to the bathroom, so if you're looking for privacy while bathing, you'll need to either book a single room or have your roommate leave for a while. (The water closet does have a door though.) This wasn't an issue for us, but it may be for some, especially those traveling with children. Perhaps not surprisingly, there were relatively few children staying at the hotel the weekend we were there, and fairly few in the neighborhood overall. Our room was very quiet, possibly because it was at the very end of the hallway (facing the Hudson) and on the 10th floor, well below the nightclub on the roof. I barely heard any hall noise in the mornings - no slamming doors, loud voices, clanging maid carts, and knocking maids, etc. This is a rarity for me; I like to sleep in but am usually rudely awakened by 7am with all the hallway noise. Blessedly, not this time! Our one disappointment was that we never got to experience the hotel's trendy rooftop bar. Both nights we attempted to enter, we were told that it was reserved for members only that evening. Luckily, we did make advance reservations for brunch at The Standard Grill on Sunday afternoon, and thank goodness we did, since it was fully booked by the time we arrived at the hotel. After a late check-out and storing our luggage with the very accommodating front desk staff, we headed to the Grill for a delicious brunch in one of the hottest brunch spots in the city. There, too, we were made to feel very welcome - like regulars even though it was our first time. Our friendly efficient server, Amanda, gave us great tips about the hotel and how to locate special, last minute deals since we're only a couple hours away by car. The Maitre'd, Kevin, heard about our disappointment in not being able to visit the Rooftop Bar and offered to escort us there after brunch. We did visit the very classy and beautiful Rooftop Bar, but Kevin was called away, so he asked a hostess to show us to the elevator up. The brunch was a fabulous ending to a great weekend at The Standard, despite some chilly, wet spring weather. We were made to feel so welcome there that we look forward to a return visit - I plan to make a point of it!","Wyomissing, Pennsylvania","TravelbugMelB2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wyomissing, Pennsylvania</strong>",67,5.0

First impression not so favourable. As soon as my taxi pulled up outside, a man came rushing over and grabbed my small roller suitcase before I even had a chance to find out who he was. He was dressed like a hipster complete with a beanie so it wasn't clear he was a porter. Fortunately for me, he was so at least someone hadn't run off with my luggage. I do find it annoying though to have porter services 'forced' upon me like that. I asked discreetly at reception what tip, if any, was expected and was told $3, which I paid but found annoying as I can easily take up one small luggage myself and hadn't actually asked for the assistance.That aside, front desk friendly and helpful (and all vey modelesque looking). Loved the hotel decor. I chose The Standard over other nearby hotels like The Dream Hotel because I wanted hotel decor that was contemporary but not too over the top. I felt the hotel got it just right. I loved my room which had amazing views of the Hudson River with its mix of mid century yet contemporary furniture. Room size was small as is the closet and I would say more suited for one with minimal luggage, but I was travelling alone anyway. I was pleased to note that the room had an iron and mini ironing board. However, tea and coffee making facilities were missing which I would have expected from even those hotels not charging $400 a night. Waking up to such a glorious view would have been better had I been able to make myself a cup of tea or coffee. Nice size TV but it was temperamental and I had some issues getting it to switch on sometimes.Overall, really enjoyed my stay and would stay again. It's conveniently located in the Meatpacking District, the High Line and Chelsea Market. One night I called room service and ordered burger and fries, and it was so greasy and tasteless I actually left most of it. Disappointing for a hotel of that standard and it was only a simple burger and fries. I also went up one lunch time to the top floor bar hoping for a drink and to admire the view but I was met by an over dressed lady at the door. I was spoken to so witheringly as she cast her eyes up and down my attire that it was very clear my custom wasn't welcome. That said, our version of cool in London is a little more understated than a floor length thigh splitting gold evening gown and heels at noon, so perhaps i wasn't dressed cool enough for NY standards. I wasn't too disappointed though as I'd never want to spend my money in a bar where the front desk is that judgmental (which really, let's face it, is not really 'cool' behaviour). Those little grievances aside, I did enjoy my stay and would still recommend The Standard and come back again.","London, United Kingdom","frijolitasa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",18,4.0

It's striking when viewed from afar and has many quirky hipster features indoors. But it is most definitely saved by the fact is it occupies an awesome spot atop the south end of the Highline, an elevated park of great style and beauty alongside the Hudson River very close to the West Village. (The ""meatpacking district"" and there IS a meat distribution firm next door.) Very close to to the Whitney Museum of American Art. The entrance to the hotel is very unobtrusive, on the corner of the building. Through the revolving doors into a space I can only describe as 60s Jetsons. The room I had was very close to the elevator on the 14th floor. (Try not to get a No. 18 room for this reason.) The room had extraordinary views of the river and the village down to the World Trade Center. The room itself was mostly bed, bath and table. All were functional and comfortable but starting to show a bit of wear. A large bathtub had shutters opening to the bed and the views beyond. The toilet is tucked away almost in the closet which is I guess nice if you are sharing the room, which I was not. Nice toiletries and an expensive minibar.The rooms near elevator have a muffled but rather annoying repetitious noise from the up and down of the elevator cars (earplugs were supplied, which should have been a sign). I laughed at some of the other reviews of this hotel charging it with outrageous trendiness and agree that this hotel is almost too hip for its own good but, Wow! the views and location really rock.","Washington, DC","advocateonwheels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",49,4.0

A popular question amongst the meeting attendees was ""what do you think of the hotel?"" Which was usually answered with an eye roll. It's immediately apparent upon entering the lobby this place is trying so very hard to be ""cool"". We knew what we were in for as soon as we entered the small lobby that tried too hard to not look like a lobby. First impression is that this is definitely not a luxury hotel-garish colors and plastic everywhere. The ""reception desk"" was a few podiums manned with some bored looking hipsters on laptops. This led to the elevators where guests were fumbling with their phones to create enough light to see the buttons for the correct floor as there is no light once the elevator doors shut other than the minimal light provided by the odd loop of graphics projected from a pair of viewing boxes on the elevator sides. (Some of those images would be ""interesting"" to explain if you happen to be traveling with young children). We were given room 1014 a ""deluxe "" King room, whatever that is. The view was the best thing about the room, (we overlooked the Whitney Museum). The room itself was on the small side with the majority of the space devoted to a large banquet that would seat 5 or 6 people which would be great if you want to party in a hotel room like a frat boy. Maybe that is the demographic that this hotel is catering to if the bedside literature is any indication....""Please enjoy this nakedly awesome speaker. hook up, get nude, have fun..."" Oy vey. The large flat screen TV was great, when it was working. When we first got to the room we couldn't get the TV to work so we called the front desk. They said they would send someone right up. Nobody ever came but the TV inexplicably started working about an hour later. This happened twice on our 2 night stay but the subsequent times we didn't even bother trying to request service as we knew none would be forthcoming.Room service was prompt for breakfast - continental breakfast with the WORST coffee ever. So bitter and strong it was undrinkable. The bathroom was tiny and poorly lit, making applying makeup impossible. The shower was open to the room so you had to close the black out drapes on the floor to ceiling window wall if you didn't want the patrons of the Whitney to see an extra nude that wasn't part the the collection. The last night of the stay a group of us decided to head up to the rooftop for a night cap and to enjoy the view. Nope. Denied entry, even though we were guests of the hotel. When we complained at the reception ""desk"" we where met with a shrug and an ""explanation"" that the top floor venues were not affiliated with the hotel. Huh?

The elevators are swanky and as you will see provide entertainment as you view the videos on the screen. A side note that the shower is glassed in and there is no privacy if you are showering . . . so room sharing is good for couples or very good friends. The bars on the roof as well as the ground floor provide for optimum people watching and the Biergarten is definitely a scene to be enjoyed just know it will get crazy packed!

Overall the hotel has a cool vibe, it's a little corky, but that's to be expected from the Standard. Front Desk service was average, nothing bad but not memorable. Service at the bar/lounge (down stairs) was inconsistent. Overall most staff members I encountered seems a bit bothered when asked for help. They were eventually helpful, but it took effort. ""Too cool"" kind of attitude. Upstairs Bar was very exclusive and there was a door guard. Dress your best or you may not get in. Now to the rooms... The room was very clean and housekeeping was very consistent each day. Never had an issue with the cleanliness of the room. The rooms are very tiny. I am use to this, as I stay in NYC often, but this may have been the smallest room I have ever stayed in. The bed is a platform bed that is very low to the ground. It's a firmer mattress, yet comfortable. The overall design and feel of the room was similar to a cabin room on a ship. The bathroom was a big pain.. Wait actually a giant pain. The toilet is in a tiny room by itself, which is fine. The rest of the bathroom is directly across from the toilet. You have to step up to get into the bathroom, not a full step just enough to make you constantly trip and almost fall each time you went in and out. (About 4 inches). It's an open concept bathroom in a very tight space. When you get a shower the entire bathroom floor is covered in water, with no way to prevent. The vanity and sink is also in this space. This creates a big issue if you are trying to shower and your spouse is trying to get ready or use a blow dryer. She couldn't because she would be electricuted. My wife had to take the blow dryer into the room and find an outlet to blow her hair dry. The same issue would arise for someone traveling alone, because the floor remains wet after the shower. The other problem with this is when you are done showering and trying to finish your morning routine. You either have to stay bare foot until you are completely finished in the bathroom (but then you are standing in cold water left over from the shower) or put your shoes on to avoid getting your feet wet.

I was truly looking forward to my stay here, hoping it would be a relaxing urban retreat.Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed.The room was ridiculously tiny and looked like a cruise ship cabin. Nothing in the room could be classified as cozy. The bathroom was industrial and there weren’t any toiletries (particularly concerning due to the price of this hotel). There were pump bottles you could utilize in the shower as if it were a gym.While the room was a big letdown, my biggest complaint is with the attitude of the hostess at “Top of the Standard”. We wanted to stop in for a quick pre-concert drink and were not allowed in due to the ridiculous employee Lily judging my fine black leather sandals as inappropriate for the venue (despite someone exiting right in front of us in sneakers). I am a native New Yorker and really do not need to be judged by ridiculous insignificant employees. Due to Lily, I was embarrassed to be a New Yorker on this day and concerned at how this hotel is treating the guests coming to our city and helping our tourist economy.I wrote a letter to the Hotel Manager Kevin Rockey (twice) and received no reply. Part of the letter is re-printed below in case anyone that works for this hotel cares that the customer service was abominable.On a positive note, the restaurant staff was very friendly and the food at the restaurant is very good.Overall, I would definitely NOT recommend this hotel. There’s nothing about it that would make me overlook the service or room, not even if you scored a decent view. You can stay so many other wonderful places in NYC and if you want, just eat at the restaurant.Letter excerpt:“Dear Mr. Rockey,I stayed at your hotel, the Standard Highline this past Saturday night and I have a major concern about how I was treated.Please be aware, I'm from NYC, I've traveled the world, staying at the finest hotels and was embarrassed to be a New Yorker this past Saturday staying at your hotel.We came up to have a cocktail at the Top of the Standard around 6pm and my fine leather sandals were judged by none other than your employee Lily.I must tell you, I'm not accustomed to being judged, particularly by the likes of Lily and I was more offended than I can put into words.I was embarrassed for you by her behavior and being that I was really only on a ""staycation"", I was embarrassed to be a New Yorker as this is the foot put forward to all the tourists visiting our city.Some other things to note:-Someone exited the ""Top of the Standard"" in sneakers. When I pointed this out to the hostess she denied it although it was staring us in the face. Very concerning.-This same hostess informed me that since I was staying in the hotel I could just “pop” down to my room and change my shoes (I like my shoes, thank you).-Lily was the final Judge on my shoes and declared them inappropriate despite the customer in sneakers.FYI - We spent a fair amount in your establishment enjoying both a late night meal and Brunch the next day at the Standard Grill, where we were pleased with the service. The hosted named Soy was very friendly, professional and hospitable. And while this was my first time staying in your hotel, I have eaten there before.This incident was so infuriating I wanted to bring it to your attention directly so Lily could be disciplined as necessary and made to understand what a fine line you walk when you decide to ""judge"" someone.She needs to understand that you never know who you are ""judging"" and dealing with and it only takes one snap mistake.I know that you have had a very successful career at hotels in both the UK and New York, and I now put my trust in you to rectify this situation.I hope this feedback helps you in maximizing the hospitality provided at your hotel.”",New York,"NYCjetsetter-girl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",36,2.0

Having said that, I was there with my 10 year old daughter and we had a fantastic time. While it was a shame we couldn't visit the bar on the roof (not the fault of the Standard but strict US drinking laws) we still had an excellent time. Our room had a stunning view of the Hudson and the Financial District (not a hotel for those who suffer from vertigo as the windows are floor to ceiling!). The only downside is that the room has very little storage space for clothes etc. There were about 6 coat hangers and 3 tiny shelves and that was it for the entire room. So that would be my tip for improvement although I am informed that this is entirely in keeping with a New York apartment so maybe that is an unfair criticism! We loved the Standard Grill for breakfast and lunch and especially the lovely lady maitre d's who were so kind to my daughter and always got us a table even when they were really busy. They also really made a fuss of my daughter on her birthday and were just super kind and friendly - we felt totally at home there. We also loved the Biergarten and the free table tennis - very cool! The hotel is in a fantastic location in the meatpacking district with easy walking to the West Village and all its quirky restaurants and bars and also lots of shopping to be had close by. The Highline itself is a lovely walk and for venturing further afield the subway is pretty close by. The only thing I would say on area is that during the week it is an oasis of calm but at the weekend it is ridiculously busy so I would recommend trying to get a couple of week days in your stay as it is a much more pleasant and relaxed stay during the week. It is an interesting hotel in that all its amenities are frequented by locals as restaurants, brunch meeting places, bars etc so it doesn't feel like a normal hotel where you would go down to breakfast and eat with other guests or have a drink in the hotel bar with other guests. It doesn't work like that at all as you are likely to be one of the only hotel guests there so that is unusual but also it shows that it's a popular venue with locals. Overall, it is a great hotel - mainly because it is in such a fantastic location with amazing views so that you can feel great spaciousness in a city that can feel cramped and claustrophobic. I would definitely recommend a stay here. The staff are helpful and were always kind and polite.","London, United Kingdom","Jandal-Mu-tai-li</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",68,4.0

We relaxed (in March) outside by the most fun ice skating rink complete with tiny Swiss Chalets that rent skates or sells a thermos of cocoa and gingerbread cookies. The snowflake brand on the ice was mirrored on the ice guard's vest along with the friendly crew serving drinks rinkside.

Staff at check in was very helpful and kind. We had a room on the 13th floor (I haven't seen this in a hotel in a long time) with a killer view of downtown Manhattan, the Whitney and the Hudson. The windows are amazing and the best part of this hotel. The room is smallish, but laid out well- the table and seating was fun and functional. Bathroom- loved the tub with peek through shutters but the shower and sink aren't laid out well and EVERYTHING gets wet. Not a lot of counter space and like one hook for towels. Not ideal. We went out to meet friends and see a show and had a great time. We arrived back at the hotel late and encountered a huge line in the lobby for the rooms. When Le Bain and Top of the Standard open, they close off the lobby from those entrances and have two elevators going to the top, and two to the rooms. Kind of rude if you ask me for people paying lots of money for rooms. (Granted both of those clubs/ bars are fab and I've had a great time there before, but I wanted my bed)! On this night (Dec 19) one elevator was out of service making it even worse. It took probably about 20 mins and packed elevators to get up.Went to bed and realized that the room was super loud. You could hear people next door, smell whatever they were smoking (security did come) and worst of all I could hear the service and passenger elevators all night. ALL night. I'm a heavy sleeper but I didn't sleep well. Room service breakfast was excellent and quick. All in all- a good say but I wouldn't pay what (I think) he paid. However if you download the Standard all you can book rooms day of after 3/4 pm for around $150- totally worth it if in Manhattan and need a quick room.","Stamford, Connecticut","Griffin P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stamford, Connecticut</strong>",24,3.0

However this stay was particularly important for me as I proposed to my now Fiance (she said yes) and I have to say that I was blown away by the hotel and most importantly the service. After I booked the hotel I emailed the concierge and got a reply from Tim. He helped me coordinate the entire proposal and also the events for the rest of the 5 days we spent in NYC. I also had about a bunch of things for the proposal (flowers... etc) sent directly to the hotel which the Concierge picked up and held for me. When i arrived everything was waiting for me and I found out that we had been upgraded to an incredible room with a view that took her breath away. Further the team was proactive, for instance Corey noticed that I needed a bit more time for setting up my proposal and stalled my fiance downstairs. Catlin and Corey also helped get us in to a few clubs (which is not easy in NYC) and were able to suggest the best places.

I'd had drinks on the outdoor patio and been to Le Bain before, so I knew the meatpacking/slightly painfully trendy vibe, but it seemed like the rooms with the view of the High Line were the real draw. It just so happened that my boyfriend and I recently needed to get out of our apartment for a night, and found a low rate on the One Night Standard app for the standard queen room, and took the opportunity to book.Totally worth it! The room, while small-ish (but I think totally normal size relative to other NYC hotels), was very chic, with a lovely nautical feel, a giant bathtub, and elegant amenities. And the view was just SPECTACULAR. I can't express how incredible it is to fall asleep and wake up to such a panorama of the city (even for a jaded New Yorker). We also loved the nice touch of having the bathtub open to views of the city as well, made for a great morning soak.Small annoyances: didn't love that hotel guests don't get any sort of special access to the rooftop bar or club, nor would they make reservations for guests on the outdoor patio. The elevators were weirdly slow, leading to very long lines in the lobby. We had some issues with the water temperature control in the room - it was hard to get it to be anything other than scaldingly hot.But on the whole, a wonderfully romantic experience that I'd especially recommend to couples and honeymooners.","New York City, New York","NYCDeeps</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",8,5.0

With the price tag it has, you would think they would have thought of not just the design but also the practicalities. The bathroom design was not thorught-through, for example there was no space for the bin so it kept being in the wa or you had to move it outside of the bathroom. Just small little things like these I expect better from a 5* hotel. Second let-down was actually the service. To be honest, across all hotels in the US I've stayed at this was the lowest level of service.Also, during the evening the fenced off one of the elevators up to the rooms for the outside people going up to the bar...On the other hand, the location is absolutely fantastic not even walking distance as you're in the midst of it! As soon as you get up a couple of floor you get a great view - but honestly most places on Manhattan you get that!For those who care about that - the architecture and design is very nice.Ps. A lot of the standard's glory comes from the rooftop bar/club - don't think just because you're guests at the hotel this will grant you access as I saw happen to some guests unfortunately.","Geneva, Switzerland","Mllelle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",47,3.0

If you're looking for an interesting experience, it's worth taking a flyer and trying it out. Very artsy, which is unsurprising given its location in the Meatpacking District. I had a lower floor room, which looked directly out onto the new Whitney building, as well as onto the River, so I had some spectacular sunsets while I was there. There's an adorable mini ice rink at the front of the hotel outside during the colder months, as well as heated seating all around it for those who wish to hang out but not partake in the skating. The rooms are a good size for NYC rooms, and there are very deep separate tubs in each room, which was a nice touch, as were the floor-to-ceiling windows. Decent restaurant attached for breakfast, and a solid bar area for cocktails. Definitely could have used in-room coffee in the mornings, which has become fairly standard in my experience. The front-desk staff was the biggest downer -- not welcoming, cold and borderline rude. But the rest of the stay was quite pleasant. Make SURE you do not get a room anywhere near the elevator. I was across from one and down two rooms and I could still hear it going up and down all day and night, which made it quite hard to sleep.","Atlanta, Georgia","Shannon E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",41,4.0

If your looking for great shopping (Chelsea market, Vince, Rag and Bone, All Saints, to name a few) great Dinning (Spice Market, Old Homestead, Morimoto, Buddakan, Tao) great clubs (Provocatour, Marquee) then really to look any further than this hotel is a waste of time. It's perfect for singles or couples looking to immerse themselves in the hip bubble of indulgence that the Meatpacking has to offer. The Standard is a great value for what they provide....The bed and the pillows were so comfy. Made for every type of sleeper. (I sleep on my stomach and side so I need a pillow that's squishy soft and has ""give""- these pillows had that). Monique at the front desk was awesome and so accommodating with a birthday upgrade. Staff was super friendly (including Wesley, Caitlin, Andrea, Kyle, and Corey) and the hotel was very chic and vibey. Views of the Hudson were incredible. The sunset over Hoboken is a must see! Thank you to all and we will 100% be back. A parking note*- from thurs after 1230pm till basically Monday morning, there is plenty of street parking which opens up off of Washington st, down towards Jane, Perry, Haratio streets, etc from Washington to 7th ave Room note*- it's totally worth the upgrade to a Deluxe King Room.

I know the hotel very well and I know its usually a hit or miss. This time unfortunately it was a miss. I booked a room for 1 night during Valentine's day. Since it was my first Valentine's day with my boyfriend I wanted it to be extra special. For me it was important to get a room with a big tub and an amazing view. I live in Manhattan on the 10th floor of a building and I have a pretty good view, but since this night was special I wanted an epic view. I booked the Deluxe King which isn't their cheapest room. I emailed and called in advance to guarantee I had a great view and that I did not mind paying more to get the best view possible. They assured me it would be great. I got there at 3pm on the dot and the check in line was huge. The lobby was a frenzy. No one offered to help with my luggage. I waited 20 minutes to be helped and was told my room would be ready in another 20 minutes, 40 minutes after checkin time. I finally got my room and it was on the 4th floor. My home views are significantly better. Its like they did it on purpose because I called in advance. Everyone walking the highland could see right inside my room and that was especially awful with what I intended to do on a romantic evening. 2 elevators were broke and I had to wait nearly 15 minutes to go up or down. The Top of the Standard was lovely and so was The Love on Top Package I pre-booked. The next day I woke up wanting to have breakfast in bed and was told they were not doing room service because the elevators were still broken. A day later and they had not fixed it. It took another 20 minutes to go down. The check out line was huge and I wasn't even offered a receipt. The front desk had an awful superior attitude. I love the Standard as an establishment but they ruined my expensive valentine's day (Almost 1k for a night). It gets harder and harder to go there and its such a shame for such a hip, trendy and sexy hotel.","New York City, New York","dsendas</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",5,1.0

None of this was hard for me to set up - I simply emailed the concierge asking how to go about this and Corey responded and took care of everything. She was friendly and attentive not only throughout the prior email exchange but also for the duration of our stay, where she remembered and addressed me by my name, impressive in and of itself for a hotel this size.Overall, I was very impressed with the Standard High Line.

The interior was very nicely decorated. However, the room was very small with no place to store clothing or luggage. The shower has a big glass wall, so you can look straight into the room, and out of the window to the view. But, there is no shower curtain. When I called the concierge if he could tell me where the converter for my Europe charger was, he told me it was for sale above the minibar. For 'just' $25. Trying to get to the lobby with the elevator is a chore. The roomservice, luggage carriers, cleaning maids and plumbers were taking the guest elevators. We were pushed to the side of the elevator, just to make room for a big cart of dirty linens. I was even asked to leave the elevator, because the cleaning maid was going up, instead of down.When the water pipe on the third floor broke, the elevator was flooded with water and the people who wanted to go down, had to take the stairs. Our friend who is 8 months pregnant, had to walk from the 15th floor down.When we checked out and stored our luggage behind the counter (we had a later flight). A few hours later, we wanted to put our newly bought clothes in there. We weren't allowed to go to our luggage, instead it was brought to us in the lobby. The lobby is almost as small as the regular guest room and it was very crowded. To stand there with unfolded underwear and your personal belongings in the open is unacceptable for any hotel.

On the surface it looks the part, the rooms have been thoughtfully styled and the themed bars and restaurants atmospheric. However, much of what the hotel offers is a glossy veneer with the fundamentals having had corners cut.There are 300 or so rooms and four elevators. That should be fine, apart from in the evening when they close two of the elevators off to paying hotel guests and reserve them for the exclusive use of the top floor bar. When we stayed, one elevator was out of service and yet they still closed two off for the bar, leaving a single elevator to serve the hotel (including room service trolleys and laundry etc). At the price they charge this falls well below the expected service. How can a hotel of this size not have at least two service elevators and enough elevators that guests aren't waiting over ten minutes to get to their room? The lines were crazy.The other shoddy aspect is the lack of soundproofing. Noise from outside was not an issue (which is surprising for the location) so full marks on that front, but the internal soundproofing was well below standard. We could hear conversations in the nextdoor room word-for-word and were woken up by the sound of people running baths/showers in adjacent rooms. Maybe they pulled out the sound insulation to save a bit of money but it speaks volumes that complimentary earplugs are provided.The final gripe is the service. I thought America was built on good customer service, but at this hotel that seems to have been lost in the gloss of being cool. They are all beautiful people for sure, but there was an overwhelming lack of sincerity. This hotel is all about their exclusive clientele in the bar and keeping up appearances - the hotel guests it seems are just there to pay the bills.",London,"weekendwanderer09</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London</strong>",1,2.0

However, the guy who checked us in on the front desk just handed me a black book with info in it and when I asked which room we were in I was told 'it's written down'. I had to ask where the elevator was and we weren't offended any help with one luggage. We had to then stand in line for the elevator.

Starting with the reservation and the personal Concierge communications through both email and phone, we were able to schedule our stay around a big venue the hotel was hosting. We had a great dinner at the Standard Grill- steak, b.sprouts, mushrooms, and the dessert all fantastic. The hostess came over with a unique hose dessert consisting of wafer cigars in creme to die for. The hotel itself is right below the highline (recommend a short or long stroll if you've never been), has a rooftop club and another nice lounge with views, and is centered near a dozen night hot spots within a block or 2 ( no cabs, no freezing when cold). The staff was wonderful, from Matt P. the concierge I dealt with, the ladies at the front desk at check-in, to the valet crew (they're inside an out, mic'd up with radios so they are all on top of things). Give your valet ticket to the EARLY, and maybe take a stroll for coffee because it does take them time to retrieve your vehicle. Again, the biggest, most beautiful hotel room ever, friendly and helpful staff, and fantastic dinner for two.

Perfectly located on the Highline - it is in the Meatpacking district and walking distance to all the dinner places, cafes and cool areas close by. It is also 2 streets away from the subway - meaning you can easily and quickly get to all the tourist locations across NYC (2 stops Away from Times Square)!!2. Rooms - We got a basic queen room and it was amazing! Whilst small (but not too small, it is nyc after all), the room is as modern as it gets with an unreal shower/bath, amazing bed and incredible views of NYC!!! Not sure what more you could want to add!!3. Accessories (and wow!) - The hotel has so many amazing features!! First the rooftop bar which provides sweeping views of NYC. The German beer hall which is very cool (but can't be heard from your rooms). Very late night dining in its restaurants! And yes, an ice rink during winter! Seriously!

It was perfect in that it was an 'as advertised' rooftop set-up that catered to a more mature crowd. They had plenty of specialty drinks as well as carrying my not so oft carried brand of Jack Daniels.

The hotel was not bad at all, just not what I was expecting and accustomed to - a more traditional hotel with the usual hotel-like lobby. We arrived on a Friday close to midnight where the nightlife was in full swing. When the limo driver told us, ""This is it, this is your hotel."" I was pretty sure he had the wrong address. It looked more like a club. I asked him to wait for me while I went in to verify. As I entered the very dimly lit lobby with what looked (to me) like club goers, all the more I became sure this was NOT my hotel. I walked up to the counter just to make sure. ""You wouldn't happen to have reservations under *gave my name* would you??"".. The guy checks the system.. ""Ah yes! We've been waiting for you to arrive! Welcome to The Standard!"" I came out to the limo and signaled to my wife that this was indeed it. She walked into the lobby as confused as I was.We were assisted up to our room and as the door was opened, we both looked in and just stood by the door for a few seconds.. everything was just so.. see through. . All glass. We slept with the curtains drawn to enjoy the view of NYC.. Since our room was opposite a building construction, we woke up surprised to see the construction workers (before the actual start of their work) looking right across at us. I rushed to close the curtains. This was also a problem since they had plain view of you doing what it is you're doing in the bathroom as well.All that being said, it was a great experience. The rooms were very clean, the room service food was great, and the staff were all very friendly! I'm sure my wife and I would have loved this hotel even more if we were 15yrs younger (before having our 2 lovely daughters).A very hip and cool hotel!

The only advice I had received was not to stay in the Times Square area as it is WAY too hectic. The second part of that advice was to stay in the Meat Packing District. My GF (now Fiance) and I fancy ourselves to be amateur foodies, with an additional zest for shopping and cool nightspots. For starters ... this area and Hotel were Perfect! After I made the booking online, I had contacted Caitlin in their concierge department. This girl spent so much time with me on the phone and over numerous emails ... she was incredible. She assisted me with some additional celebratory items for our room, dinner suggestions + reservations, guidance on transportation + the subway, even offered some great opinions on other things to do and see based on what I told her we were like! She definitely helped my anxiety level on visiting a place where I was completely out of my travel comfort zone + on top of that had the added pressure of asking my gal to marry me. Once we arrived, the hotel was super cool! The onsite staff - amazing! The front desk staff, bellmen, everyone was helpful, friendly and always upbeat! I have to give a special shout out to the onsite concierge that helped us out as well, Corey. She was sassy, fun, friendly and super helpful! She found us an amazing speak easy, gave us good shopping + restaurant advice and hooked us up with some cool touristy things to do. She made the stay at The Standard more enjoyable and definitely more memorable! To do at the hotel: The Standard Grill was outstanding! We ate here a couple of times ... The Cuban Sandwich + Elaborate Cocktails are must haves. The service was prompt and friendly as well. The Standard Biergarten was also super cool. It is an outdoor covered patio beer hall that has great beer paired food like pretzels + sausage, a large selection of beer, ping pong tables and a great atmosphere! Excellent for an afternoon day of drinking! The Standard Plaza - great little indoor/outdoor spot in the front of the hotel. We traveled in December and the front of the Plaza area is actually a skating rink! Very cool! The cocktails and snacks here were also very good. Some great seasonal warm cocktails and unique small bites style menu. Le Bain - rooftop bar which is a great nightspot on the weekends. Honestly, we partied there on a Friday night ... and my memory is a little foggy. What I can say is that it had a cool atmosphere, great music and the cocktails were flowin! The area of New York that the hotel is in is also very good. Very easy to grab a taxi or an Uber from the front door, hop on the high-line or a 10 minute walk to the subway. The area is also populated with a ton of cool shops, restaurants and bars.I would 100% recommend this hotel. Overall, New York was pretty hectic and overwhelming at times; however, coming back to the Standard each day felt like coming home (my sexy NYC home). Oh and if you made it this far along my review, I proposed at The Rink at Rockefeller Center AND ... she said yes!

We have so many amazing memories of this place: The Standard Grill is the premiere NYC brunch, the Boom Boom room a magnificent venue for evening cocktails with a stunning NYC skyline as the backdrop. The staff from the front desk, the concierge, the lobby bar, the room service and housekeeping are friendly, polite and ultra helpful.The only advice I have is visit the Boom Boom room in the early evening/on weekdays. At weekends after 7/8pm there is access only from the public entrance. Firstly do not confuse the Boom Boom room entrance with the nightclub entrance as (rightly) the crowd is different- younger, edgier in the club...more cosmopolitan/mature in the Boom Boom room. The only issue is the attitude of the manageress (situated at the ground floor entrance) and her security staff who do not seem to care about hotel guests and indeed seem to take sadistic pleasure in treating them without respect or courtesy...at odds with the incredible service standard of the hotel staff...this needs attention both in terms of the system for access which is poorly communicated to hotel guests and the absence of normal courtesy which can only be addressed by hiring a suitable managerial replacement. It was embarrassing not only for us but our guests (local friends who have significant status in the NY business community) to be treated in this manner.We have a few days left and will ensure we avoid the public entrances to the rooftop even if it (sadly) means partying off the hotel premises.","London, United Kingdom","silvijy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",0,5.0

Having just stayed at the Standard High Line, however, I did it anyway. Infamous for its floor-to-ceiling windows that afford viewers/voyeurs a glimpse into those rooms whose denizens are daring enough not to close the curtains, the Standard High Line has featured in several movies, and the latest Madonna video, which cements its current pop-culture relevance. There is more at work than trendy hot-spot status, however, and this hotel, perhaps more than traditional stalwart standards, epitomizes New York in the best possible way. Modern style reflects the urban landscape outside the wall of windows, and your room feels like part of the city in ways both energizing and invigorating. Looking over the High Line and new construction, you feel connected, and while some hotels do their best to take you out of the city, the Standard immerses you right in the midst of its vital, beating heart. For the daring and exhibitionist of nature, this is your playground. The shower looks out into the room through a large glass partition (right up against the bed) and there’s no curtain or any way to block the view. Take note, the side of the tub/shower is exceedingly high, even for a nimble person – be careful when entering and exiting. The shower head itself is powerful of force and generous of distribution, and the fragrantly-exquisite bath products are environmentally housed in permanent bottles. Staying with a married male friend necessitated a shower-in-shifts protocol, because neither of us wanted to see the other person’s bits and knobs. Not a big deal, but surely not for everyone. (Hell, I know of married couples who wouldn’t feel comfortable with the set-up.) I gave in and let it all hang out. When in Rome…The rest of the hotel is equally enlivening. Several bars and restaurants line the base of the hotel (and the top floor) presenting options for all. On the weekend I was there, they were just setting up the ice skating rink on one corner of the property. Stylish revelers mulled around in the lobby, festive garland was being hung by the elevators, and a fleet of front desk handlers smiled and greeted guests with efficient aplomb. Some hotels get lost amid their own trendy self-importance – the Standard treats every guest as an elite member of their entourage, and the service and care is impeccable.","Albany, New York","Alan I</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany, New York</strong>",96,4.0

The nightclub next door is a different story. If you can catch the bartender between checking her Facebook profile on her mobile you may get served an overpriced drink in a plastic cup ($20 for a dirty martini plus tip).

I have stayed in NYC hotels many times, and have seen other beautiful hotels for cheaper.- I didn't like the design of the bathroom: there is no door (toilet is separate behind closed door) so when you take a shower, the draft will make you feel very uncomfortable. There is also a glass wall that separates the shower from the room, so you may not like that if you really like your privacy in the ladies room.- this is not the hotel's fault, but the outside was very noisy when we tried to go to sleep with consistent car honking. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to stay somewhere else where it's not so busy late at night.CONCLUSION: Beautiful, modern hotel, but is simply too expensive and not worth the money, considering there are other hotels in the area (without the hype) that will offer more luxury for a cheaper price.","Northampton, Massachusetts","ana17925</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northampton, Massachusetts</strong>",37,4.0

Good beds. But... once you move up the noise of the night club is very, very present. In all those times I visited I considered it my own choise to stay in this hip 'disco hotel'. But this year the noise was even worse. So I decided to take a look. But then.... I was refused at the door by a 24 year old , I think one calls this a 'hostess' unpolite, and an attitude ""higher then the standard'. I was with international guests and so terribly embarassed to have taken them there. Business men from Krorea in front of us (also hotel guests) where sent away.Unbelievable to return to your room and have to bear this loud noise.

The hotel has some great views, good beds and pillows and intelligent space in the bedrooms. It is very 'vintage contemporary'.

Everything is übercommercial, nothing for free.

Months of planning went into making sure everything would be perfect - from assuring that their rooms would be ready to coordinating the meeting and dining areas. I'm happy to say that working with the onsite team at The Standard made what could have been a logistical nightmare seem like a walk in the park. Laura Oakes and her colleague Diem (who heads up the banquet area) took care of all of our dining requests which included arranging for private space for meals and accommodating last minute dietary changes. The High Line Room (where we held our all day meetings on Friday) is an ideal setting because of the enormous terrace outside that allows you to have the best of both worlds and afforded our guests the opportunity to step outside for a breather in between meeting sessions. On Saturday morning we arranged for a private breakfast in the Garden Room and had our own personal chef preparing omelets made to order (very impressive). Now for the rooms - if you can - please request one of the harbor view rooms - the views are simply breathtaking. I was fortunate enough to be upgraded to a Luxury corner suite harbor view. Just be prepared for the enormous floor to ceiling windows and the lack of doors (other than on the water closet). All of the rooms come with all possible amenities and we were able to work with Rowan Hand (The Global Sales Manager) and Anya Palaukhina (Manager of Group Events) to secure Harbor view rooms for all of our guests. The weather cooperated (which is rare for the beginning of November) and we were all able to enjoy the fine dining offered in the plaza area in front of the hotel along with the Biergarten and the Top of the Standard. The staff at The Standard are really what make this hotel such a pleasure to visit - any request was promptly seen to and always with a smile. In conclusion if you find a chance to visit the Chelsea area of Manhattan and are looking for a unique but classy hotel please check out the Standard. I loved it and so did all of our international visitors.",new york,"luckyny</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>new york</strong>",14,5.0

I love the way it straddles the High Line allowing you to watch the first visitors of the morning through the floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall window. I enjoyed being able to walk out the front door of the hotel into a vibrant neighborhood that is within walking distance of several convenient subways lines, some good shopping and restaurants. It was nice to be able to sit outside for a drink in the afternoon or a coffee in the morning or to be able to enjoy brunch at the Standard Grille. What I didn't particularly enjoy was the room itself. The only seating in the room was a banquet seat that was fine for short periods of time but very uncomfortable for lounging or reading, leaving only the bed for relaxing. There was really no place to store clothing during our stay--two small shelves in the closet were the extent of the storage provided so I lived out of my suitcase. Just inside the door to the room was a small, open tub/shower area with an oversized tub on one side, and an open shower on the other. This small tub/shower room was open to the room's entryway and had a louvered window that opened into the bedroom itself. The issues this presented were threefold: first, unless you could open the louvers AND the curtains to the window looking outside (and it was daytime), the shower was very, very dark as the only light source was a small hooded bulb on the wall; second, the shower made a horrible racket; third, because the whole thing was open into the entry hall into the room, it provided no privacy at all.All in all, the room was fine, the restaurant/bar facilities were terrific, and the neighborhood was good but with all the hotel choices available in New York it's not likely that I'll return to the Standard.","baltmore, md","lsnyder813</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>baltmore, md</strong>",26,4.0

This hotel really falls down on the service side - the little things that make your life easier whether travelling for business or pleasure. Room service food consistently arrives cold and late. Substitutions on the menu are not permitted, and the menu is grossly overpriced for what is delivered, even for NY. It's the same story in the downstairs restaurant, a very limited menu poorly executed. There is no comfortable seating in the rooms, a hard bench and an uncomfortable straight backed chair are all that is provided. The tile on the bathroom floor gets very slippery when wet; there is no separate shower box, so that is often. The toiletries are terrible - if like me you pack light and rely on the hotel to have decent shampoo and conditioner, make an exception in this case. The awful hair products plus the $7 drugstore hairdryer meant I walked around the city with rough, crackling hair for three days - I spent $50 on a better hairdryer to get me through the week without having to resort to a pricey daily wash and blowdry at a salon. No water is provided in the rooms for drinking other than the minibar water priced at $6 per bottle. I asked for extra hangers; none were forthcoming. I dislike this place so much that I'm writing this review in the middle of my stay, I still have three days to go and if I had time to find somewhere else I would. Like so many places, this one overcharges and underdelivers. Even the location isn't great when you're here for more than a day or so.

Now the downsides; we tried to book the rooftop bar for a couple of pre-dinner drinks and was told our minimum spend has to be $200+tax per person. Sheer greed. And on arrival on Thursday they told us both the Biergarten and roof top bars were out of bounds for private functions. Greed again!

This is the price you are supoused to pay for $500/ night average. What is ridiculous: if you arrive late in the evening after a intercontinental flight, you will hardly see the entrance of the hotel, totally confused by groups of people standing up with glasses and waiting on the line to a disco/bar. In the front desk, a trendy girl with yellow hair wont say hello or welcome, but with sad face will give you the room key. Elevators are black, no lights, black buttons and psicodelic films on the walls, hardly will you find the button of your floor. Rooms are small and clean. Quenn bed is pushed into a glass wall of the bathroom, so if you share the bed, one of you need to crowl during night to go to bathroom. Bath tub has more than 1m high wall that makes your daily shower a risk sport. Breakfast was included, but.... No buffet: so you choose a la carte, and they give you a credit on your daily price.

It was recommended to us by a friend. It is in a great part of town, the new hip meat packing district/West Chelsea. It was fun exploring the area. The staff at The Standard is top notch. Very friendly and helpful. We got a handwritten note referring to the event we came to NY for and a bottle of prosecco in our room, after we checked in and went out for a bit. Our concierge person was Elijah, and he was great. This is not an inexpensive hotel, but they make you feel welcome and they take care of you, so the service is commensurate with the pricing. We did eat a light snack at their grill and sitting outside was wonderful. Again, not inexpensive, but a lovely experience. We also had a drink at the rooftop bar which was beautiful inside as well as the extraordinary view. Drinks were pricey, but, again, we expected that. What was a little bit of a surprise was the fact that we were asked if we wanted still or sparkling water as well as our glasses of wine. We said still, and they brought over a bottle of Italian water. And then we were charged $12 for it. I assumed we were just getting 2 glasses of water (tap - which would have been fine). That's really all I wanted, so I was a little shocked at the bill, considering we only had 2 glasses of wine, which were pricey and then paid for a bottle of water that we really didn't want and didn't know we were getting and being charged for. But, it is a minor thing, and now we now to just specify tap water, if that's all we want. The room was lovely and the noise level was very good. I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay here again.","Austin, Texas","Liz D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",1,5.0

We even managed to get into the Top floor cocktail bar for a few drinks which is simply stunning and the service was fantastic. BUT we felt very let down by the service and reception we received at the ground floor outside terrace bar. The first time was at about 6 pm. The hostess didn't seem very keen to have us there and then the servers took an age to appear as did the drinks. We felt a bit like we were interrupting the staff social gathering that was taking place by the bar. The second time was at 330pm the next day when we wanted drinks/coffees whilst we waited for a taxi to JFK that the reception staff had efficiently organised for us. The seater again didn't seem too pleased to see us and when she did find us a table, and we asked for coffee, she snapped that she didn't take drinks orders and that we needed to wait for the servers to take our order. We waited but they didn't come. Again there was a staff gathering by the bar that didn't include taking our order. After 20 mins we walked out, somewhat disappointed.

I must admit that the overall decor of the hotel is not for me, though possibly some people must like it. I found it dark and confusing. The lift is so dark that all of us were fumbling to find which buttons to press. The room was bright, with a great view of the river due to the floor to ceiling windows. It was extremely small though, with the bed literally stuffed into one corner. Clearly its not meant for business, as there wasnt a proper workspace to work on with the power points inconveniently located.

If you are a senior citizen or with reduced mobility, this hotel isn't for you (at least not the room I stayed in) as you have to climb over at least three feet of bathtub to get into the shower.On the plus side, do eat at the Standard Grill it was great (and busy).

Very trendy, and I didn't feel like the V neck on my T-shirt was deep enough. The room was a real surprise - the wall between the shower and the living room is glass and there is no way to cover it up. So, if you're sharing a hotel room with somebody that doesn't normally watch you shower, this may not be the hotel for you. However, after adjusting my attitude I found that the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. They seem to show a genuine interest in making sure that you are taken care of. The decor of the room turned out to be a pleasant departure from the usual hotel room. Even the ride in the elevator is fascinating because of the video that is shown on two walls. I almost wanted to just ride the elevator up and down so I could see the rest of the video. The location is really good, plenty of restaurants and clubs in the area and right on the High Line.

However, our room was located near a building under construction, so it was a bit of an eyesore. The room itself was nice and spacious enough to spend the night (staycation). Loved the see though glass from the bathroom. The bed and pillows were comfortable, mattress was firm enough and pillows were soft and fluffy. My only problem was operating the shower handle! There's an option for either the tub or shower head, but I kept getting them both on at the same time. Luckily, my boyfriend was able to remedy that.

The bed is also against a window that separates it from the shower. Not a wall, a huge window! If you have a ""10"" body, it is fun to see and be seen, but at some point you might prefer something frosted when you are taking a shower. The location, places to eatnand drink are all wonderful. Highline is right there, as is the Whitney. Note to management, if you see an older couple come in, give them a room with the walk-in shower rather than the rather risky tall bath that we had to climb into - without handholds of any kind. (We had two rooms, so I know that you have the less sluppery option). Also put a small corner shelf anove the bed where it is against the window wall.

The bathroom is actually gross. The shower is actually the bathroom itself so water goes everywhere and does not drain. So when you are trying to get dressed you either have to soak up the water with a ton of towels or you slosh around in the water left over from the shower. The toilet is literally in a closet so for those of you over 5feet 4 inches this is not a good experience. So my guess is this is a great hotel for the youngest of young adult travelers who are probably used to living in dorm like situations but for anyone over the age of 28 there are much better hotels nearby for the same price.The one great thing about the hotel is the location and nearby restaurants and scene.

On the ground floor there's two different dining experiences, both great, brunch or dinner. Also on the ground floor there's beer garden with fresh pretzels and ping pong tables. This is an exciting and louder room. Behind the concierge you'll find a sleek little store that you can purchase really cool gear and home decor. Once in the elevator, you enter another dimension. The TVs play a really neat movie to set the vibe. The hotel rooms are all good. I've stayed in the most affordable rooms and top suites. I've enjoyed both. There's also a roof deck and bar to view the city. All in all, I can't say enough great things about The Standard.

Eventually had some help from the bell boy who was challenged by the amount of work he had to do. Went to the reception and checked in.... 'Welcome to NY' was flat as a, well, not a New York stack of pancakes, if you get my drift...we were certainly not superstars arriving so stop expecting too much! Here's your keys and there is the lift! Ok... The rooms are standard... That is what it means... I get it now. Brilliant views and the basic accommodation. Wave to me while I shower everyone! No luxury here. Moving on. The hotel was very busy...it was apparent that it was the place to hang out, be seen or be... A party venue for the locals...we didn't get to the sky bar( indoors) as there were constant private functions. We did manage the roof top outdoor bar. We had to queue with everyone else to get up. No special entrance for guests. The roof top bar was a lot of fun. After a while we came down for a coffee. Where can we have a coffee, I say. Mmmmm are you eating? No, I explain, we have just been on the rooftop and we are guests and we would just like a coffee...Ah, says the waitress, you can have a Starbucks just round the corner.... Mmmm no I say, we are guests in the hotel, where can we sit and have a coffee? Oh she says, you can have it to go..... OH for heaven's sake, I say. Where is the manager? Finally, we are shown to a seating area that was there the whole time. The thing is, the terrace is lovely and we did have breakfast there. It was good but you can't take a table if you are not eating. The brasserie is very good and has a nice buzz. We were booked for five nights but only stayed three. If you are attending a function then stay here for that night only....you probably don't care where you crash. If you are a tourist who wants a NYC welcome stay elsewhere. You can go to The Standard anyway. The reason I say Sub Standard is because the hotel couldn't care less whether we stayed or went. Must be great to get all that business with so little effort.

I had always wanted to walk the High-Line. Since we checked in on one of the hottest days of the summer, we skipped the Line, and decided to bar hop throughout the many fun restaurants and bars located at the Standard and the area. This is where are all the beautiful people have gone. The Standard, located in the Meat Packing District is completely different then where we usually stay in Manhattan. The crowd was young, eclectic and quite sexy. The Standard radiates youth and excitement. My husband called it the ""Universal of New York City for Adults."" We ventured to beer garden, the grill, the Bain, Brass Monkey, the 18th floor. We were giddy. The rooms were unique. I prefer a larger bed, and not on the floor, but it was tolerable. The bathroom was cool, and the views of NYC were unbelievable. We had one issue with our luggage, but the Staff made up for it with a delicious cheese platter, and an apology. One suggestion is that they come up with a map or better guide to restaurants in the hotel, and hours. The other suggestion is the staff needs a uniform or name tag to identify them as staff.

It's definitely a hip and happening place, right in the middle of the action. Being on the High Line is fantastic, we walked it every day we were there. This was a part of NYC I would only be caught dead in years ago, it was like a whole new world was opened up for me to enjoy in my hometown. The restaurants in the area are amazing - Chelsea Market, so close! Our exceedingly clean room faced the Whitney and while the view wasn't stellar, it was a basic good NYC view. The floor to ceiling windows just seal the deal...great light, great space. The bed was very comfortable. However....Recommendation Hesitation 1: Our room, because of it's class and size was actually an ADA room. All the rooms in this class were (Superior? Deluxe? Can't remember.) and while one does give you more room than the other, you get a shower that opens directly into the room with NO door and NO light. Seriously, black tile shower with one teeny tiny light. When I called down to tell the front desk that I couldn't stop the water from rushing out on to the carpet I was told ""that's why we have an extra towel there. So you can put it on the floor to catch the water."" Okay, no big deal, it's not my carpet. The room is so gorgeous otherwise I could ignore that. Luckily though it was just my daughter and I because each night we got full frontal shots of each other as we showered. It might have been a bit more awkward with a friend. (Understatement emoticon). Does that ruin the stay? No, but be aware based on your needs. Hesitation 2: While the front desk folks were clearly eager to please, slightly poser-ish urban chic (and I say that in a good way, it fits the ambiance), the rooftop folks and private function workers need a stern lesson in tact. When I went to the roof early one afternoon to check out the amenties for later in the evening I was recommended to return dressed in different clothes. I had just walked 4 miles on the High Line, of course I'm going to change to go out for the evening! Outrageous!! Same was true for the workers on the private function level (2?). They managed to insult a man on our elevator by presuming he wasn't a part of the function being held there. Spoken quite abruptly with frustration: ""I'm sorry this is a private function!"" as the guest stepped off the elevator. Why would you start like that? Why not say, ""Hi are you here for the X Function?"" Guest was clearly miffed and indicated he was indeed there for the function. I was taken back and it wasn't my exchange. Front desk and concierge, who were attentive and spot on for recommendations, need to train the upper floors on customer service. For this price point there should be much better consistancy. The overall feel for the average guest was unwelcoming. Would I stay here again? Evenutally, maybe. I'm trying something different next month. Do I recommend it? A reserved yes, for it's good points, but I wouldn't say get in at all costs.","houston, tx","VinoMio_NYCluv</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>houston, tx</strong>",19,3.0

The meat relocated years ago, making room for the hip, new residential and business establishments that have rapidly taken over the area, booming into the rarified upper regions of Manhattan’s stratospheric real estate ~ in what has been dubbed the “Epicenter of Cultural Happiness” by Esquire Magazine.The Standard is part of a worldwide chain of trendy, chic, new-age hotels. A bold, modern-style architectural statement, straddling the “Highline” (downtown New York’s linear park built on what used to be a train-line serving erstwhile lower Manhattan’s riverfront docks and massive warehousing industry) this establishment hosts a variety of eateries and bars at the street and several other levels, each offering a different cultural and gastronomic experience, and varied aspects of NYCity-life and urban vistas.We had brunch at the Standard Grill, seated outdoors in one of the shaded sidewalk-side arbors covered by green, leafy (and living) vines, offering a cool respite from the clear, fall sunshine. It was a beautiful, quintessential, fall NYC day: a crisp breeze, just a precursor of the coming winter (thinking back now, it didn’t tell us anything about just how severe that would turn out to be) and warm sunshine, throngs of people everywhere, tourists galore, and mad traffic with crazy taxi-drivers everywhere ~ no place to park, but my tiny, fully-electric “Smart-for-two” manages to squeeze into the smallest spaces between two badly parked cars, so it does pretty well in NYC. (BTW ~ I highly recommend everyone get one of these wonderful, nimble machines.)Service is quick (once you find a table…as waits can be lengthy) and very friendly. The food ~ very much up there, and the prices reasonable. (Our waitress pointed out Bill Gates, who was seated indoors with his family, so I suggested she give everyone’ lunch tabs to him, but that didn’t quite work out!!) Had a quick lunch and then visited the Highline Park to enjoy the rest of the afternoon breathing in the fast receding remains of summer.Well worth a longer visit, perhaps to another of the restaurants at this hotel… on our next downtown trip??","New York City, New York","alokjolly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",86,5.0

I didn't pay for the room so I can't comment on the value, but I can say that the hotel staff of fantastic. Friendly and accommodating. The rooms are small (normal for nyc), but everything is neat and clean. The shower being in the middle of the room was odd though. And the water closet (toilet) smelled weird. Not offensive, more like dirty water or something. It's hard to describe. Luckily it's in its own room so we just kept the door closed. The restaurant (the Standard Grill) had great food that was reasonably priced for the city and the location. And the service was excellent! We were told it was a 35 minute wait but we got a table in 20 minutes or less on a Saturday night. The location is great and there is also a beer garden here, though there was a very long line and the bar worked on tickets you had to buy instead of cash which was odd. My only issues are that around 8pm they close off one hallway near the elevators witha mirrored wall and it's very dark so it seems creepy and because there are floor to ceiling windows in the room, you can hear a lot of street noise, at least from the 6th floor. The line for the discotheque at the hotel ran under our room so when we got back to the room around 1am, you could hear a lot of noise from the people in line.

I've stayed at The Standard - Downtown LA but love, love, love this NYC property more. It has 9 places between the ground and 18th - 19th floors to eat, drink and be merry (plus your room). Plus the High Line Park is the gem of Manhattan. Plus....there's an Apple Store around the corner and the relish Chelsea Market 2 blocks away (try Taco #1 there, reasonable and super tasty for a quick bite).All the workers were super friendly and accommodating, consistently willing to be of service from the grill, to the beer garden, to the front desk, etc. Yes it;s a super hip hotel yet the room are well compact but well designed and comfortable. Easy to take UberX up or down down ($12 to staten island ferry. $14 to Saks 5th Ave, $8 to Madison Sq Garden) Plus the meat packing neighborhood is evolving, it's the new NYC SOHO.We'll be back ASAP.**photos attached**","Boston, Massachusetts","Grazpicts</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",0,5.0

Yes, you get the trick: as a hipster place, you can just enjoy the people who come to be seen, I really recommend the terraces downstairs, great people seeing spot. As an exhibitionist you can show yourself in Adam and Eve outfit to the whole city. Or you can go to the rooftop bar and meet hipsters. Be careful though dress code to get upstairs is a bit tight and line can be long, no hotel guest fast track.Overall: fantastic location, great design, nice bars and restaurant, but a bit crowded: not being able to get a table to have a drink at the hotel bar because it is overcrowded is a bit annoying when you are an hotel guest.","Maastricht, The Netherlands","FloranH</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maastricht, The Netherlands</strong>",101,4.0

I would not recommend this hotel to my friends for that reason: * Noise shower: We could hear it anytime somebody was taking a shower next to us. I don't know what's going on with the water pipes, but it's noisy.* Noise staircase: I woke up several times because people from Le Bain were coming down the staircase on heels (between 2AM and 5AM) making loud noises.* Noise boomboomroom/Le Bain: Throughout the entire night of the stay I heard booming music from the BoomBoomRoom or Le Bain. It was a constant annoying noise (beats).* No welcome pack: We were promised a welcome pack but never received one.* Unknowledgeable doorman (did not know the facility since he only worked there for a couple of days). I asked him for some advice on dining in the neighborhood and what the facilities in the hotel were. He did not know. Also I wanted to know whether I could utilize a pool. Again he did not know whether there was a pool available.* Luggage pick up: In the end when we wanted to leave it took 10 minutes to pick up a hand luggage suitcase which should be easy. I am a platinum member at SPG and never experienced that wait time.The most annoying part was that I indicated all of the above concerns to the one at the desk on the day of departure. The only response was ""that's strange...never heard that before. But OK"". That was all. You guys live up the a standard so guests should feel the same. Very disappointing in my case.

This hotel came highly recommended. And I believe and accept that alot of people would like it. Why? I'm not sure. I think the Meat Packing District and the hotel are 'on trend' right now. I just hated it. It was FAR too cool for school. To the point where I wondered if any of the people who designed the hotel had actually done any sort of hospitality training. Whilst aesthetics can be liked or disliked (I personally think that bakelite is no longer used for a reason), the fundamental parts to a hotel should not be caught up in the 'personal taste' section. If a guest is paying over 200dollars, then THE BED NEEDS TO BE COMFY and accessible from both sides. If the guest has paid and been given a NO SMOKING room then...guess what, the room should not stink of smoke. I think these guys were just too cool to care. And considering the night my husband and I spent at this hotel was the only night in NYC and our last night to our honeymoon, we were pretty disappointed. And our room had an awful view, the thing that made us want to go there. And the rooftop that looked so cool we were never able to find.

Livingstone named his discovery of the largest waterfall in the world in honour of Queen Victoria, who took the throne of England at age 18, was bestowed with the title of ""Empress of India"", and became a national icon, identified with strict standards of personal morality and integrity. If we are indeed to believe that history tends to repeat itself, it should be no surprise that 160 years later, I, much like Livingstone, would dedicate as grandiose a discovery to as noble an individual. After a long and arduous journey across the oceans and the jungles of Queens and Manhattan, my exhausted, broken, and confused self gazed in awe at the gleaming structure containing the Standard High Line Hotel. Standing strong, mighty, and glorious much like the natural wonder of Victoria Falls, I was quickly drawn into its inner depths, fueled by a desire for exploration not dissimilar to that of Livingstone all those years ago. How very appropriate to be greated at the front desk by noneother than Victoria herself! As noble, available, and helpful as earhtly possible, she guided me through all the hidden gems offered by this establishment, and did so with unmatched attention and genuine affection. André Balazs has found himself a true Queen of hospitaly in Victoria, who together with the masterful help and support of Sarah, Sophia, Samantha, Cecili, and Andrea holds court in this Kingdom of unparalleled energy, relaxation, and entertainment. The Standard High Line is the prime destination for all those seeking new thrills, discoveries, and their very own slice of a wonder of the world. Thank you, and to next time!

An attempt to be posh compromised functionality and guests' experience- room design: there are minimalist room designs that are smart and others that are not; this belongs to the latter. It is impossible to find hooks/rails anywhere to hang your wet bath towels. Everywhere you turn there is always a door or a corner that gets in your way. Shower is poorly lit and there is nothing to stop the splash from soaking the carpeted floor - noise: stomping sounds from the club resonates throughout the hotel; on the lower floors, you hear everyone from the beer gardens belowThis place is a CLUB, not a boutique hotel as its claims.

On this visit we upgraded our room and it made a huge difference. We got a corner room with full length windows on each exterior walls with wonderful views. We were over the high line so could also see folks strolling below, we also had a closet that we did not get in the standard room. The bed was comfortable and the amenities nice. There are no small amenity bottles to take home, but full size bottles the hotel refills much more ecological. The shower is large with a rain shower head, but the sink is in the shower which makes it difficult for two to use bathroom at same time to get ready. Also the sink is fashion over function. The spout is a pipe coming out with a flat sink making it tough to get your hands under and more challenging not to splash on yourself. Potty is separated across the hall which is good. Nice flat screen TV, robes but no coffee maker which would have been an appreciated addition. Note there is construction across the street for a high rise so be sure you get a room that won't have view affected. Service here is very casual. When we were last here guests could make reservations for the Boom Boom Room. This time we where told that entry was at the discretion of the door man. Come on now !

It runs right along the High Line which is a cool walking trail/park. The first two nights I stayed in basic queen room and found it very comfortable. If you've every stayed in NYC you know how small the rooms can be and this one is pretty tight too, but at least it had a workable desk for laptop, etc. The last night I was in a spacious one-bedroom, but I didn't find it worth the extravagant price. The service at the hotel is not four star, but the staff was friendly. Certain issues (elevator that didn't work, phone that didn't work, overpowering paint smell on the 17th floor, room service request that never was delivered) were a bit of pain to navigate around and for the price you should expect better. Nevertheless, I'd stay again for the simple fact that there is just so much to do on and around the property. The BIERGARTEN was a personal fave- I was traveling solo so this was a fun place to people watch and I loved that they had ping pong tables for interactive socializing. The Le Bain rooftop bar is a must-see (complete with a creperie!), and the Standara Plaza Grill has such a chic setup for outdoor dining. The decor is funky, odd and erotic.

For those who lived on another planet for the last years, the Standard stands for one of the hippest coolest places in NYC… or used to. (today it seems half of the guests are classic businessmen on a seminar… so i wonder if the place keeps it luster).After a visit at the one in Miami a few years before, i was not over-expecting. To be fair:- rooms are really nice, clean (which seems a must but not always…) and well conceived. The 60s furnitures and style make the cosy, and once you kinda get the idea to close the curtains, you really feel home.But then…:- very noisy: sound insulation is not enough- impossible to get it dark: curtains are not covering enoughBoth points seem details, but yet at this price it is not.Bars & restaurants: - honestly food (breakfast) is rather good, price is OK, service… depends a lot on who you get. It ranged from not very useful to close to perfect. Same for the bar, the best was when the waiter did not know ""pinot noir"" which is about the only wine by the glass….Worth going?Why not if you feel like being super trendy and have the service to match.

So what is it? Well, it's cool (possibly too cool), it's stylish, it's well located and it's now a real destination in itself in New York with the hip crowd flocking to the rooftop bar/club (Le Bain) and to the Grill for brunch. The new Whitney museum next door will only add to this.We have stayed in a number of places in New York but we keep coming back to the Standard. On this occasion we stayed in a Liberty Corner King (we have also previously stayed in an Empire Corner King). The views are stellar, the room is a good size and the decor is minimalist and cool. If you plan on staying here I would strongly recommend shelling out for a corner room for the view.If you are lucky enough to get a room on a high floor (as we did on this occasion) then the Standard can't be beaten. I am less of a fan of the rooms on the lower floors as you are constantly on display to the hordes of people walking along the High Line and the views just don't measure up. The Standard does not differentiate pricing for rooms on low and high floors which is a real oversight. I would rather pay another $100 for a guarantee of being high up with a view than turn up and find myself in an argument with the staff on the front desk.I will stay here again - I recommend you do too (just cross your fingers the staff take a liking to you and give you a room on a high floor).","London, United Kingdom","JamesFl377</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,4.0

The combination of cost and mixed reviews has always pushed me another direction but an onsite meeting this week was the prefect opportunity to give it a shot. Spent 2 nights in Queen room 1617 for a conference rate of $400 per night. Checking in at 5 pm on a Tuesday was slow as there was only one agent working and about 6 people in line. Another gentleman finally came out from the back and he did not look at all happy to be there but it made the line move faster. I was told at check in that the rooftop bar was business attire and was ""more or less a private club"" after that. I assume that was code for no 40+ years olds allowed.This room is everything that others have mentioned. For starters, don't think of sharing a room with someone you are not very comfortable with as privacy is non-existent. Rooms are of course all smaller in NY but this would be a tight fit for more than one person over a couple of days. Open air shower faces the tub, bed area and ultimately the great view. Plenty of towels in the rooms which was a nice change and the products they offered were great. It's always nice having the pump bottles on the wall for convenience. Queen bed was comfortable and low to the ground. Small table and seating area were nice for extra space or storage but not all that practical to use. Although we stayed on a Tuesday/Wednesday night, I did not experience ANY noise at any time of the day or night on my floor. Climate control worked flawlessly and the views were stunning. Location is great to enjoy the nearby bars and restaurants.

It's a shame that a) they did a rotten job of soundproofing; and b) they manage the hotel for the party people, not the guests. We started on 16th floor, moved to 15th but still too noisy, finally got some sleep on floor 7. They also lie to you at the front desk, tell you you ""might be disturbed if you're a light sleeper,"" but if you check any reviews (which we should've done) the complaints about noise are consistent.

Staff are on hand to help whatever your request. Restaurant food and service was excellent. Even a last minute request for late checkout was handled efficiently. Many thanks to all for making it another great, if not short, New York stay. Looking forward to another stay at The Standard when next New York calls.","Sydney, Australia","MichaelEC61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",13,4.0

The location was great.... so was the stocked mini-bar and our view. However..... costomer service could be much better. It didn't feel warm here and I didn't feel like we were important at all. They should make their clubs and Restuarants more accessible to their guests. Not makung them wait on an hour line .When your paying $600 a night noone wants to feel like an afterthought.

Very scene driven & very Andre Balazs who is always on the pulse. Interior designed by quintessential NYC designers, Roman & Williams - the hotel has that 60's-70's retro-chic theme going on (R&W very influenced by Alvar Aalto and it shows greatly here) which makes you feel in the know and a part of the whole vibe of the hotel.The views are amazing pretty much no matter where you are....from your room, the gym, the rooftop bar and especially the very selective Boom, Boom Room (the scene where Carey Mulligan sings in the movie Shame was filmed here). As one reviewer just stated - it IS a sexy hotel (no wonder a movie about a sex addict was filmed here) and it does everything in it's power to stay sexy. NOTE: Guests can go to the Boom Boom room (Top of the Standard) - women have to wear dresses and men in closed toe shoes. It's cocktail attire. They're trying to take you back to a time of piano music jazz crooners and hollywood glamour. Food it TINY & it is insanely expensive ($20 for a cocktail).We liked people watching outside at the Standard Plaza. SERVICE: Staff are all young & beautiful and pleasant. Service is hit or miss. Room service was actually good - very prompt & portion was decent. BOOKING ROOMS: Ask to be as far away from the Club as possible when booking. Be careful! I've actually stayed here quite a few times and this last time was the longest (over a week) and there is barely any nighttime respite from Le Bain nightclub which starts thumping at around 11am but really gets going at 2am. Sure they give you earplugs but if you're people who aren't used to wearing them, they tend to fall out and when that happens you're screwed. The concierge were very patient when we asked to be moved three times (they must be used to that request) and as a result, we ended up in a much more expensive (although stunning) Hudson Suite. It was still noisy but much, much better. The thing is with this hotel - you get sucked into the whole nightlife way of life & have to go along with it as a guest with no choice which for $500-$1000/night based on the room (we had to move 3 times because of the noise) is not really on. It literally dominates the whole hotel. That's the price you pay to be in the Meatpacking District though so know that going in. Location is fab day or night and the hotel plays a massive part in adding to the locations vibe. If you're looking for rest & recuperation - The Standard is not for you. If you're looking for rest at all - The Standard is not for you. If you're looking to party - The Standard is for you. If you want to be in the hub of things, people watching, clubbing, shopping etc. - you'll embrace The Standard and all of it's too cool for school ways. We happened to like The Standard because we were in the mood for NYC and all of it's energy & LOVE the location. Also though, because we spent the 1st week chilling in St. Lucia. If it weren't for that, we would want a quieter hotel for sure. Just know what you're getting into when booking - it's not just a hotel, it's an entire scene. If you're looking to impress visitors who are coming to NYC for the 1st time and want to be in the thick of it (so not your mom& dad!) - this place is as good a start as any in NYC. It'll set the tone.","London, United Kingdom","LAZ1609</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",178,3.0

At about 900 SF, it is one sexy thing!!! Fantastic view of the Empire State Building, the Hudson, the Freedom Tower, not to mention the High Line. The bath tub is huge and next to the bed! The double shower with rain shower and reflective black tiles is awesome. We used the water freely! (We are from California where there is drought.)The living room is party central with a bar sink, lavish bar, and an ipod sound system, spare powder room, and giant seating pads for hanging out on the black carpet.Minor down sides: we were on the 17th floor, directly under the bar on the 18th floor. The music can be heard, but did not bother us much. We consider it part of the ambiance. It is a non-smoking suite, but whiffs of smoke can be detected, especially in the bedding.

Check in was a bit of a shambles and there was a lot of chaos around reception with missing luggage. My room wasn't ready at check-in time (3pm) but they put me in a different room for a couple of hours while they got my room ready so I could chill out. I was in the Hudson Suite on the 13th Floor. The room was spectacular. Faultless in fact. Incredible views, comfortable, clean, stylish with a free standing bath tub. Very special indeed. What they didn't tell me was that the nightclub on the 18th floor goes on until after 3am on a Sunday night (Thursday to Sunday I believe). So I had a really terrible night sleep. The base / thumping reverberated around my room from 8pm until 330am. It was ok because my first business meeting wasn't until midday so I was able to sleep late. On the Monday when I enquired whether or not there was another event on that night I was advised there was another party that would run from 10pm until 3am. Clearly I was anxious about another bad night sleep. I was moved to another room (the same suite) but on the 9th floor. This was at the hotels suggestion. From that moment on the stay was perfection. I didn't hear any noise from the nightclub and had a wonderful night. All in all I loved this hotel due to the views, comfort and location. The noise from the nightclub is a huge fail - it's ok if you are a 20 something hipster (which I am not!) and having seen a wide variety of people in reception I imagine many wont have been pleased. However, if you are specific in your reservation about staying below the 12th floor then its definitely worth staying at this hotel.","London, United Kingdom","Nick M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",49,4.0

The location is fantastic alsoNow the bad :( - i struggle to put the words customer service in the same sentence when talking about this hotel. There does not seem to be any appreciation of paying guests i.e. residences. From the bar down stairs where you will wait 30 mins for a drink and 45 mins for a table, yes a table! We were staying for 5 nights and every afternoon/evening we had to wait for a table despite the fact we were paying 500 a night!! to the vacant looking and unhelpful staff at front desk it seems like they go out of their to not look after their guests. It seems obvious to me that the staff have not been trained at all in the art of customer service - its not their fault however i highly recommend that management take the staff off to a marriott or westin and get them understand what customer service is. While we got over the lack of service or sense of feeling even a small bit the valued the icing in the cake was the 18th floor bar! Now please note, YOU WILL NOT GET ACCESS TO THIS BAR IN ANY REGULAR WAY. In the 5 nights we got to see it once. Every other night there was a private function. The bar is not run by the hotel which is not advertised,NOTE THE GENERAL MANAGER ( who i believe reads these) - you should make it very clear to guests that you do not run the bar and it is very very unlikely guest will get access to it.Overall i am sorry to say the hotel was poor as a result of its service. While all the staff look cool they unfortunately don't know how to give a top class customer experience. The location is fab and with training and some tweaks the service could be great.","Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Mark O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Dublin, Ireland</strong>",13,2.0

As other views have pointed out the noise can be a problem: I stayed on the 14th floor and could hear the thudding of the nightclub on the top floor, but this was only a problem on one Saturday night. I discovered that simply switching the aircon fan to High was enough to drown out the music with white-noise.The bathroom situation is strange: the shower is behind a large pane of glass without any blind or screen. That's fine if you're alone but if you're a couple you will have to be very comfortable with each other!Generally the hotel is looking a little bit shabby these days and isn't luxurious, but this didn't bother me hugely.The room service food is decent but obviously very expensive (no more or less expensive than most hotels in NY I'm sure).

Originally I was only staying for 3 nights and when I add another night that creates two bookings. This is a business trip, I am not here on vacation so I plead that I would be happy not to be upgraded and would rather get settled in the room I am staying in to which I am told there are no rooms of that type available. I am tired so go with the flow.The bellman brings my bags up quickly and I unpack whilst admiring the view of The Hudson and the High Line.The room is odd with the toilet and basin on one side and an open shower on the other. The table top is badly scratched, the ceiling decor is warped and everything is clean but shabby. I check the mini-bar and it is up to scratch.Up early the next morning I go to the gym. The first treadmill is 'blocked' which means it isn't working and then the second one is working but you can't get the TV. But the view is good so I concentrate on my exercise despite a guest sleeping on a yoga mat just a few feet from me (bizarre).Having a shower without a curtain means that you need to be careful that you don't flood the place. Breakfast is served downstairs and I have to speak to 3 people before it is clear who the hostess is. She seats me and the eggs Benedict are fine and served with a decent pot of English breakfast tea. I work using the free wifi at the desk watching the comings and goings on the High Line. I catch the maid and she services my room when I ask which is pleasing.That night I need to eat early before a show and the front desk recommends a great place close by (Fig & Olive) as I head out.It is when you get back post theatre that you realise that as a middle aged woman you are just not young or cool enough to stay here. More priority is given to getting the cool people (who aren't guests) up to the rooftop bar rather than looking after paying guests.Last night I got back late from the theatre and was just about to drift off to sleep when the person next door took a shower and the noise from the water pipes was deafening and that kept me awake for another hour. You can hear doors slamming and people in the hall all night long as well as the noise from the street and nearby clubs and restaurants.As told to I packed up my things this morning and gave the key back assured for the second time that my bags would be moved whilst I was out. I even left a tip to make sure that the move went smoothly.I have just arrived back 4.5 hours since I 'checked out' and have been given the key to my new room but my bags are not here and now they are having trouble locating them!So for what you pay this hotel it is merely a try hard and not in the same league as other hotels in its price point.A very disappointing experience.","Perth, Western Australia","Mazla</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Western Australia</strong>",51,3.0

So this is frustrating. It would be nice to have issues resolved during our stay and not an apology that is useless after.Having said that, we are enjoying our stay...I think your perspective on this hotel definitely depends on your age. I'm in my 40's, 20's something's will have a different take for sure.Location, atmosphere, vibe can not be beat. I'm mesmerized by the elevator. Haven't made it up to the top yet....but restaurants and bars downstairs are fun.Rooms are ok.....nothing to be impressed by...style over substance, but the bed,despite appearance, is extremely comfortable.While the service aspect has been lacking, the staff have been very friendly and generally helpful.

But partying seems to be on the minds of most. there are lots of eating places nearby but many close at 12 midnight at least during the week. Shops abound. But bring money.

I hope this will be helpful to other travelers as there are so many great properties to choose from in NYC. Location: Perfect. In the heart of the Meatpacking district. Many many great shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. Property: Quirky (in a fun, good way) We had a corner king room overlooking the city. More expensive but worth it.Staff: This was a bit surprising. I did not expect the level of friendliness and customer service that we received. Everyone, from front desk to housekeeping staff went out of their way to be helpful and kind.Hotel Restaurant (The Standard Grill) and other eating/cocktail areas: Had several meals at the Standard Grill. Food was great. I will say that the service was slow and sort of unorganized. One person brings water, another person coffee, another person delivers meals....if that system works to the benefit of the customer.... great. It did not though and we were there for breakfast 3 times and dinner once. The wait staff was not overly friendly and did not have the level of customer service commitment that the actual hotel staff had. We will go back though. In fairness, the last breakfast we had was at the bar area and the server/bar tender was fantastic with a higher level of service commitment not seen by us with the other restaurant staff. The living room type lounge area was great for coffee or a drink. It was to chilly to sit outside although would have been great...weather permitting. Service in this area was prompt and efficient.One should note that the hotel is not a quiet property. We stayed on the 5th floor, city view. We used ear plugs, a sound machine and still heard traffic, etc. I would add that I think that is part of the deal if you want to stay in a prime location and will not prevent us from staying again. It was also a bit confusing regarding access to the night club which before 10:00pm is referred to as the rooftop lounge. We never could get in as it was privately rented out. We were not particularly bothered by this but thought it was strange.We look forward to our next visit.","Omaha, Nebraska","FROMOMAHANEBRASKA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Omaha, Nebraska</strong>",32,4.0

There is no doubting that due to its location, amazing rooftop bar and general coolness the hotel gets swamped at the weekend but this only added to its atmosphere and we were happy to allow the coolness to rub off on us!

The closeness to the High Line is also a plus. Every visit to this hotel should include at least one walk along the park. My only regret is that I was there in early April, so I missed the summer greenness of the park. There are several subways stops near the hotel, and I could always get a cab, so it is a convenient location for exploring other parts of NYC. The only thing I didn't like was the night club on top of the hotel. The night club is on the 17th floor and my room was on the 14th. I could hear dance music every night as I tried to sleep. It wasn't exactly loud, but it was noticeable and hard to sleep through, even using the set of earplugs provided with the other more typical bathroom supplies.

But I don't need a great view. I need a quiet, private, execllently appointed room. I think the rooms are Ikea + in terms of fit out. Little things - rubblish flat hangers. I am a business traveller who wears suits. I don'twant to hand my suit on a cheap white plywood hanger. I want a high quality, shaped wooden hanger. Services: Ok - my daughter could cleean my shoes better than the bell hop. The laundry was fine.Food and beverage: I had one meal, a breakfast. Ok - 6 out of 10.Overall I just had the sense that the hotel staff feel that you are privelaged to stay in the hotel. And you aren't. It is hugely expensive for what it is and Ian Schrager was doing this better 15 years ago.","Kent, United Kingdom","RGTLondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kent, United Kingdom</strong>",306,2.0

Travelled alone to NY for business and extended by two days for pleasure. Wanted a true NYC feel away from the tourist traps and everyone recommended The Standard. I wasn't disappointed, très trendy and cool to the point that I was confused when I came though the door, felt like I'd walked in to a nice club. I got the queen room and was a bit on the small side but was big enough for my need. Really liked the overall decor and was clean but could do with a slight touch of luxury. The restaurant decor is again very good and keeping with the trendy style. The food and the service was average. I connected from the lobby to the restaurant and had to force eye contact with a waiter to get a table. He then took me to the maître de who not so much as glanced at me before asking a waitress to find me a table. The drink was great and dessert was very nice as wellThe boom boom room is magical!!! Amazing views, decor is really nice, great music there was a live band. The service was also very good and the staff all very polite. My overall experience at The standard has been very good only thing missing was a kettle and tea bags in the room. Definitely recommend a stay here for a unique NYC experience and would be coming back",,sanua,0,4.0

Didn't seem to notice the noise issues like you see in some reviews but was on a lower floor.

I spent two days arguing and looking for my belonging that the bell boy lost. The manager was of no help at all. She claims to be new and certainly acted the part. There was no compensation, no relief, and no satisfaction. She even asked me to fill in an incidient report. When I asked what help that would be, she explained that it was only for the hotel's records and it would have no affect in solving anything for the clients at all. After searching everywhere in the room for the missing bag, I went to see the reception staff again. They said I needed a ticket to get access to my car. I went back and gave them the ticket. Then, they gave me directions to the parkign garage, which was about 10 mins away. Of the staff of 5 people at the front desk, guess how many of them offered to accompany me to the large underground garage to search for my bag that they lost / forgot to bring out of the car? NONE! None of them actually offered to provide service to at least bring me to my car or drive it to the hotel for me to find the missing bag of stuff. I also did not care for the room style. Maybe we were taller than average or because they put us in a handicap room (that we didn`t ask for) but all the furniture was very short. We needed to request to be put in a standard room that was available....I don`t know why they didn`t put us in the room we reserved. Checking in at 1AM, this is not the ordeal any guests should have to go through due to the hotel's lack of competence and attention to detail. The bed was only 1 foot from the ground. It felt like sleeping on an air mattress when camping. The hotel does not provide any cot for extra guests as this is not meant for families or friends - just couples or business trips.My least faourite part of the room was the fact that teh shower was separate from the toilet. The toilet had it`s own room but the shower had a 3 wall section on the other side of the hall. I did not care for this design because I thought it was awkward to step out to the big window....because there was no other area to dry off. The window needed to be left open for the most part because the room itself was very very dim in terms of lighting. So you have the choice to dry off in front of the window, inside the wet shower or in dim lighting with the curtains closed. A few good notes:The pricey restaurant, Standard Grill, is quite good. You can make reservations via OpenTable too. The waitors are very friendly. The cleaning staff was very attentitive and receptive. The area is very convenient. It is 3 blocks from the metro/subway and it is close to many bars, restaurants, and highline trial walk. I have stayed at the W, the Westin, and various Marriotts, this was by far the absolute worst hotel I have ever stayed in! The Standard is the worst hotel in New York City!","Montreal, Canada","ice_cream_girl17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",17,1.0

I didn't read the other reviews but surely many must have commented that the shower is in full view of the rest of the room--it's simply behind glass, but that's it. So make sure you are solo or with a romantic partner. The decor was sleek. A bit too sleek, actually, in that the wee garbage cans couldn't really fit anything wider than say, a soda can. So I had to leave my takeout container sitting on the counter. Also, there were no racks to hang hand towels in the sink area. I liked the toiletries. The bed was comfortable, the room and floor were quiet. They asked me at check if I'd prefer more quiet, and if so, to opt for a middle-range floor, since the club is at the top. The toilet is as a WC, so could be an issue for people on the claustrophobic side. A friend and I hung out in the beer garden a bit and played foosball--win!

Very trendy with a younger crowd (25-40). Skating rink for young families located right at the hotel. Located in the old meat packing district. Lots of renovation going on in the area. Doesn't appear that there is much in the way of nearby shopping. As busy as the restaurants were on a Sunday afternoon, it's obviously a destination spot for locals.For people north of 55 this hotel, while very nice and modern, might present a few challenges.  The Staff: Sarah at the front desk was very helpful on check-in and was able to get me in my room for an early check-in. Much appreciated! Staff has all been friendly and very responsive. The restaurants The Plaza lounge, The Standard Grill and Biergarten (all reviewed separately) are nice venues with great food). Special thanks to Kristine, the DJ in the Plaza lounge, who saw I was a 'north of 60' guy sitting by myself in the lounge in the mid-afternoon. Out of the blue she put on an entire mix of Golden Oldies. since I was about the only person in the lounge. Wonderful experience! Well done Kristine!Room: Clean, neat and bright despite facing northeast. I'd suggest trying for a more southern exposure with a view of the Hudson. My 7th floor NE facing room is staring at a new high rise under construction 40 yards away. The room was very small (photo attached) with no dresser and nowhere to put your clothes, except for a teeny closet and one shelf beneath the safe in the mini-bar (well-stocked). High, wood-trimmed ceiling, floor to ceiling windows and large mirrors helped give an impression of more space. It would be very tough for a couple with baggage to have an extended stay, due to the room size and lack of storage for bags or clothes.The shower and sink area are wide open for all to see. The crystal clear glassed-in shower is literally 14 inches from the side of the bed. There is zero privacy, except in the commode. Might be fun for a couple if your' re a 25 year old hard body, or like to shower together. If not....there's nowhere to hide. Not a place to hang a towel in the place except room space for one towel over a small piece of glass in the shower. The mattress sits basically right on the floor. Lots of fun struggling up out of. The king bed was very comfortable though, with four great pillows. There's a single small (uncomfortable) couch (the only place to put your bag) and tiny chair and table in the room. For such a modern hotel, one of the strangest things was the lack of outlets to charge your electronics. If you travel with more than two devices, bring a multi-charger. One outlet in the bedroom area and one in the bathroom, that's it...I dragged the table across the room to be near the outlet. By the time I finished this review, the chair was killing me. There are earplugs on the bathroom sink for a reason. Until 3AM I could hear music vibrating through the bed, despite wearing the earplugs and having bad hearing too boot. Couldn't tell where it was coming from.Tip: Safe in the room is a bit different. Enter your code and then first hit the Enter button before hitting the Close button.Miscellaneous: You can print to the front desk from your room and there's a business center also.Nice fitness facility on the 17th floor with great views of the Hudson. No heavy iron, just dumbbells up to about 50 pounds and an interesting multi-exercise electrically controlled resistance training station. Treadmills and bikes with great views.Need to use your key card to access your floor. Elevators have neat 3D display panels, but the keys are black on black and really difficult to see in a dark elevator. Two high-end clubs, The Top of the Standard and Le Bain on the 18th floor. Did a daytime walk-through and they are beautiful. Access is complicated by members-only hours at Top of the Standard and I understand that you have to wait in line downstairs to gain access later in the evening. Check with hotel reservations to figure it out. I didn't give it a try.","Anchorage, Alaska","BuckA113</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",18,3.0

There is a floor to ceiling wall of glass in this room category, overlooking the Hudson river, the view is gorgeous. - the bathtub is huge, easily big enough for two, and you can see out through wood shutters to look at the view of the Hudson.- the shower had good pressure and the entire bath/shower area design is clever- there are quite a few mirrors in the room that are discreet/unobtrusive while adding to the sexy, playful, fun aesthetic. - the bed is low and comfortable, medium firm. - bath products are kiss my face (natural) which are good- our room service dinners each night were delivered within 20 minutes or less and were delicious- an electric kettle, soy milk, tea cups etc were provided on request. - the heating system was good - no easy feat given all the glass and winter temps- our room was quiet, slept great.Cons:- TV HDMI plug is not exposed so engineering had to come and dismantle the frame for me to plug in my Laptop. This is an unfortunate design flaw/oversight. Engineering were very nice. - room is fully carpeted except for the shower/bathroom. Fortunately I didn't get allergies (it feels very clean) but I do think there are lots of fibers floating about the air/atmosphere of the room. Plus, it's all light colored carpet, pale upholstery so I did get some pale lint/fibers on my black clothes.I had a great experience - it was fun & relaxing staycation. I recommend this property to anyone who wants to be downtown with great food both in the area and inside the hotel itself, a cool/dynamic energy in the public spaces of the hotel, yet still quiet and relaxed in your room with expansive beautiful views.",NYC,"AlastairCookieNYC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",97,5.0

I loved the floor windows, so much natural lighting. I also thoroughly enjoyed the neighborhood - shops at the Meatpacking District, steps away from the Hudson (sunrise and sunset are beautiful) and super easy access to the High Line. I had stayed at The Standard - West Hollywood before this one, so I like the fun vibe of The Standard culture. I chose High Line also because of its proximity to West Village and SoHo.

I was pleased when my room was ready at midday. Check in was very fast and the staff were really polite and happy. I loved the design of the room with the doorless bathroom looking over the bed. Not very private if there was more than one person in the room but fun for a business traveller. WIFI was good and everything was very clean. Where was the kettle for my morning tea? Seems a weird amenity to omit. So I've covered the positive aspects. There was a lot of banging especially early in the morning as other guests let their doors slam and noisily chatted to each other outside of my door but that's not the hotel's fault. There were trays of room service food piled in my corridor for the entire length of my stay which is a bit disgusting and not something I have ever come across before. But the reason I am giving The Standard the worst rating I have ever given on Trip Advisor is for the temperature of the room. I turned the noisy AC/heater off before I went to bed on the first night. I woke up in the night, freezing cold, and put the heater on and was able to go back to sleep having been awake for 24 hours on a long haul flight. Just to mention I never normally wake up in the night. When I woke up in the morning the room was cold and the heater had turned off. I didn't spend any time in the room except to sleep and shower in the mornings. When I got back in the early hours for my second night the carbon monoxide alarm was going off. I don't know how long it had been going off for but my neighbours must have been able to hear it. It was so loud. I called reception and within 10 minutes they sent a very polite handy man to change the battery and stop the alarm. Learning my mistake from the previous night, I put the heater on before I went to sleep. I woke up at 3am shivering with cold. I checked the temperature and it was on 60 degrees (15C) pumping out freezing air. This was the lowest temperature on the gauge so it may have been colder than this in the room but couldn't register. I tried to increase the temperature but no heat came out. It was Sunday 15th February, the coldest day on record for NY in years. In my tired/jet lagged state I thought the room must be so cold as it was so cold outside. Obviously upon reflection, the AC was faulty. I knew the hotel was fully booked so I wouldn't be able to move rooms and I didn't want to go through the hassle twice in one night of calling the handy man again so I just put my coat, hat, gloves and scarf on and tried to go to sleep. I finally managed to sleep for an hour at 6am and was then woken by banging from neighbours' doors again. The bathroom floor was so cold, I had to lay a trail of towels down just so I could walk on it. When I checked out the reception was much busier and I had to queue. I complained about the temperature in my room and suggested they fix it before the next person checked in later in the day. The woman was really dismissive and although she apologised she wasn't even listening, just trying to process me as fast as possible. I was so tired and really quite angry and just wanted to get out of the hotel and warm up in the minus 16C outside. Unfortunately the room had been pre-paid by my company or I would have refused to pay. I am now trying to get a refund. I would stay at this hotel again as it must just have been bad luck. The location is good. Most of the staff were really nice and the rooms are really well designed. If I'm ever in the same situation again I will be sure to raise an enormous fuss and insist on a change of room. ",,Sammux,28,1.0

Turns out I was upgraded my first stay, and I keep going back, hoping it will happen again. It hasn't. The rooms are very small, and there aren't a lot of places to put things away.That said, The Standard is a lot of fun. Not only is it in a great local and has gorgeous views, but it's also home to the Boom Boom room, Top of the Standard, and Standard Grill. This was my fourth try to get into Standard Bingo, and we got in! Though it's pretty late for a Sunday night (reservations start at 10:30), it was a lot of rowdy fun I will not soon forget. We also got a table at Top of the Standard with my teammates. Very classy, great drinks (though expensive), and again, gorgeous views. Ask for the back area if you can. Even though a few of us were staying at the hotel, we had a lot of problems getting in. Even though we were before 9pm (when they turn services over for late night, meaning limited elevator access and having to wait in a line just off the hotel), they kept shepherding us away from the elevators, making us move to place to place, and were a bit rude. If you go, go before 9pm.Their elevator situation is quite a puzzle. They cut them off and make you walk all the way around at odd hours I couldn't figure out. At certain times only two elevators were working, and there was a long line just to go up them (no, they were not for the Boom Boom Room or The Top of the Standard). Strange experience for hotel guests, and with only two working elevators during those times, it takes a long time.At this visit, they had a few wrapped snacks waiting for me along with a pair of ice skating tickets. Very nice touch.Overall, every time I stay here I say to myself ""this is the last time"" but I'm a sucker for entertainment and the hope of that one-off upgrade, and I keep coming back. My biggest complaint about this hotel is the lack of space to put things. If I'm staying somewhere a week, I expect some type of storage mechanism for my clothes. Their tiny options just don't cut it. But, again, I keep on coming back.","San Francisco, California","Cristina M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",27,4.0

It has far more personality than a standard chain hotel, but far better amenities than a typical boutique hotel (a good gym, very good restaurant, easy access to cabs and the subway).The rooms are stylish, modern and offer great views, while still delivering on the practicality that you need as a business traveller (a good bed, a table to work on and enough space to unwind). But the best feature of all has to be the hotel's location right atop the remarkable High Line park. And, if you're a runner, the riverfront running/cycling path is essentially right outside the door.Random tip: Try to get a room with a tub—they're bigger and the tub itself is excellent.

PS.I have friends in the area and in the business who confirm but besides that my taste buds don't LIE....Drink wine or beer a save the trouble, 15 bucks per drink is not a big deal to us, you can charge me 30 I could care less, but don't screw me and if you do screw me at lest kiss me xoxoxo....Check out, was given someone else's bill pay attention you always should anywhere you go.The valet pulled my car up and didn't offer to load my bags in the car Oh well! no tip then!! he must be loaded or own the dumpster outside.I will copy and past this on other sites and save it and paste every month as this place is a true dumpster dive. for those who come from over seas, spend your money elsewhere. a two star hotel may be a good recommendation to stay if you looking to stay in this meat bucket in th meat packing.Sharon Osbourne was right!!!

On the Monday night, my colleagues and I went up to the bar on the roof (The Top of The Standard or Boom Boom Room) and were not allowed in!! (Private Function apparently). UNBELIEVABLE... can't use hotel bar as a resident (they trumpet on about it and then won't let you use it)!!! I was so annoyed, at the very least I should have been informed at the time of booking that the bar was not available, so check before you book. At the end of the day, this place is no great shakes and has an undeserved reputation, staff didn't seem too fussed that the noise on the 14th floor was terrible (I dread to think what it was like on the 17th).

Since the Standard was right around the corner, the grooms suggested their guest stay there and got us an attractive rate of $230 a night. I contacted the concierge and had a wonderful chat and they arranged a car service to pick me up and drop me off from LaGuardia and applied the charges (including tip) to my bill. I have to admit, I loved the service and the idea of not having to deal with paying/tipping, just get out and go.When I arrived, room was not read, so I was okay with that since I met two gentlemen on the plane who could not say enough about the Standard Grill, so I went. But that's another review, I will write that after this one.The hotel is hip, trendy, in the Meat Packing District, ice skating rink smack dab in front - I was impressed. Tiny, efficient lobby and desk clerks were very attentive. So, needless to say, my lunch was not doing so well, so I really needed that room. Got the key and went up. OMG, one side of the bed was against the wall - that did not make me happy, plus the damn thing was about 4 inches from the floor. This hotel is NOT for somebody in their 60's. If you like bending down and rolling over on the floor to get out of the bed, this might be for you.They could not change rooms because the other rooms, same issue - they do not offer two beds. I knew this before I went; my girlfriend and I were sharing the room. Who, in their right mind wants to crawl into a bed up against the wall??? I had the outside because I needed the bathroom, duhhh, read the restaurant review.Okay, I am just not that young, nor was my ""roomie"". The bed slept okay, the room, although tiny, was very efficient, if you like living out of your suitcase - there was no where to unpack anything and barely space for cosmetics and hair products for two women.I love, love, love the area; but just DO NOT RECOMMEND this hotel for mature people who do not want crawl over each other, nor sleep that close to the floor. Staff was very nice and helpful. I should have known something checking in, the only people I saw were the thirty something crowd.

I was really looking forward to going to The Standard for Christmas holidays: in the past years I've tried Americano and Gansevoort, I've been uncertain because there were new hotels in the area since I came the last time. As it was a kind of honeymoon I decided to go for what is still considered one of the best location in town (or in West village area) and made a reservation for a superior king. We figured we were going to an heavenly place with wonderful sightseeing, polite employees, top food, narrow but comfortable rooms. Unfortunately, too many things were stacked up against them for me to give them a good review.First, we've been given a room on 14th floor, n. 1403. The view was amazing, really. There wasn't a wardrobe or a closet but only a tiny recess entering the room and two shelves in the piece of furniture hosting bar, safe, refrigerator and snack. We've unpacked only coat, jackets and shirts and left everything else in the luggage (a choice that resulted useful on the second day of our stay). Taking a bath watching the Empire state building, with foam all over was great (complimentary soap, shampoo, conditioner, cream were the highest quality), wonderful sheets and pillows and soft towels in the bathroom. Unfortunately air conditioner / heater, that we switched off immediately, continued to make noise as if it was at set the highest. We ask assistance, then we went for a walk. We came back at 8 p.m. and the noise was still awful, we went downstairs at the grill for dinner (the Christmas menu was pretty good, the steak ordered by my BF was decent), passing at the Concierge to submit again a complain and ask the intervention of a technician. We've been told for the second time an engineer would have solved the problem. After dinner, pretty tired because of flight, we went back to room; before taking the elevator we asked the concierge about the noise coming form the AC hose: the lady assured us it was solved. Of course it was not and we didn't sleep: it seemed we were still on the plane, as the night before, during the flight from Italy. the following day we asked for the third time to fix the problem and the arrogant Nadine, in a roundabout way, explained me I was a stupid tourist bothering her, ""who has so many things to do and can't loose her precious time with a person who is here today and not tomorrow"". Being treated like a stupid because you complain of intolerable noise and, most of all, because twice we've been told the problem was already fixed, is not funny when you pay a significant amount of money to sleep in a tiny room with a fabulous view. Anyhow Nadine, in her unlimited tolerance, right after an hysteric attack, told us she would have called an engineer to fix the problem. I really did hope he wasn't the same guy supposed to have fixed the problem the two previous time. We came back at 9 p.m. and asked if the problem was solved, we've been replied it was and we were reassured by the kind and polite guy that took care of our luggage on arrival. I asked him to follow us in the room but smiling he replied there was no need because everything was ok. Of course it wasn't. Tired and deject we called the reception and after the umpteenth explanation of the problem (spending holidays on a plane is not this comfortable), we've been contact by the manager that offered a change of room. He was kind and explained the problem could be solved only breaking down the wall (or the ceiling), therefore he offered us to change the room, eleventh floor room 1105, same view, same category. He gave us the chance to change immediately or the following morning. As we were really tired due to two sleepless night in a row we decided to change the following morning. Now I'm no t severe, but this an pricy hotel, not an hostel, but I'm still arguing why three people took the liberty to fool me saying the problem was solved when the only solution was change the room and break the wall? The following morning, after another sleepless night, at 6.30 I was at the reception to get the key of the room promised by the manager. I've been told by two guys both kind and polite, that the room was still occupied and we couldn't move before 3/4 p.m. They could offer immediately only a room at 5th floor, which I refused having paid for a superior room. Anyhow we packed our bags and decided to go to Metropolitan museum. When we came back at the hotel, in our new room (1105) our bags were moved, we unpacked and a shower, than lied for a while. We suddenly heard water flowing and ran to the bathroom because we were afraid the toilet was broken. Fortunately it was not, or unfortunately: it was the noise of the shower of our neighbour. We were lucky because he was taking shower at normal hours 7 p.m. or 8 a.m. in the morning (except one morning at 5 a.m.) so the loud noise wasn't a huge problem but I still can't believe there's so little sound proofing in and between the rooms: it really seemed that neighbours were having shower in our room. During our stay, except for Nadine, the staff has been kind and polite: great breakfast at the grill on January 1st, they kept our luggage stored when we went to Avis to get the car (we moved to Washington on January 2nd), the pillows and the bathrobe were the best ever experienced and the view from the room, the bar at 18th and the gym were really amazing.Overall, we were very disappointed for the noise and service, meaning with service the management of the noise from AC hose. When you're paying this much for an hotel room, you expect top notch everything and on sound proofing and problem solving everything was very mediocre and disappointing. I will not be coming back and will be advising against this place. I highly recommend that you take your money elsewhere, unless you decide to accept a significant compromise to enjoy the breath taking view from your hotel room.","Bologna, Italy","Valentina C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bologna, Italy</strong>",31,2.0

Hip and trendy! Fun stay in Meat Packing district. I had to come to Manhattan in the midst of a cold front for a deposition from my home in Marin ( Northern California). Just two months ago I had come for a little vacation with my daughter Danille. We chose the Dream hotel in Chelsea and I fell in love with Chelsea Market and the high line. Since I chose my hotel as a way to explore a neighborhood, for my husband and I this trip I chose The Standard.What a pleasant experience. While the room is smaller than the Dream... It's tiny... We don't mind at all. My husband is a big guy.. 6'4""... But he's okay with the size. That's because it's so well designed with mirrors and glass. It's modern and sleek and really functional. Besides, we are on the 11 th floor and have an amazing view of the Empire State Building! Magnificent at night. And the room is very quiet, a welcome change from the Dream.We made a mistake our first night here and thought of trying out the rooftop bar at 9 pm. The euro trash crowd was in full swing. The hostess wisely advised us to come back another day at 4 pm to enjoy the view at sunset. We did. We went today at 4:30 pm. I now understand that the hostess was speaking in code. At 4:30 pm, you can dress more casually and everyone was around our age... Middle aged. And the sunset was glorious. I took many photos. It is the most sensuous decor imaginable. I enjoyed a glass of scotch and we shared a cheese plate with real honeycomb and oysters. Such a relaxing way to end the day. Oh, and there are even two fire pits inside. It's my favorite bar in Manhattan!!!The staff is lovely. And it's easy to get everywhere.. Chelsea market, cab to Broadway theater is only $10, and a quick walk to SoHo.We had breakfast at The Standard Grill which you can get to without walking outside .

The High Line is a fantastic way to view the city. The roof bar is superb, the price of the drinks is well worth the view and The Standard Grill is a culinary experience not to be missed. Addionally the staff are really friendly which isn't always the case in NYC. The bathrobes are seriously luxurious. But the rooms are all style and zero practicality. The bed was huge and really comfy but one of you has to sleep in the corner next to the bathtub which means the only way in and out is through the bottom of the bed or leg-over your partner. Only one bedside shelf (yet alone a table) so if you get the inside there isn't room for a glass of water. There is NO storage, a rail with six hangers, not a drawer to be had. I absolutely hate to live out of a suitcase in a hotel, I like to unpack but no other option. The only place for said suitcase is on the floor under the coffee table. The hairdryer is pathetic, for this room rate I expect a pro salon dryer. Maybe they think all their guests turn up with a stylist?! The glass bathroom wall does mean that if you forget the privacy curtain the construction workers across the road get a free show. The mini bar takes up so much room in the corridor it's single file only between the bed and bathroom. I will drink and dine here every time I am in NCY but won't be staying again.

About a 2 block walk to the Subway and a block to Chelsea markets. West Village right next door, there's so much going on. If your staying in NYC stay in Meatpacking it is the absolute best area to stay in, forget staying in Times Square and anywhere in Mid Town its all a tourist trap. New Yorkers hate those areas, I went to Times Square once and didn't want to go back. I would not have enjoyed my time if I stayed there and a lot of friends who have stayed in those areas have come away from NYC not having the great experience I did. The hotel itself is pretty good, good service, cool entrance, all rooms have amazing views, we looked out over the Hudson. Service was great & the bed area of the hotel room was great but I didn't like the bathroom, it was weird. Its basically a shower/bath near the entrance door of the room with no curtain or door for privacy. When you wanted to get out of the shower to dry yourself you have to sort of get out onto the carpet in the room or step across the entrance door into a sort of powder room. Wasn't great from a female point of view. The corridors also had ugly carpet and were freezing. These were really the only negatives for me.

What's good? 1) The views are fantastic, from both the rooms and the bar 'The Top of the Standard'. 2) The rooms are modern and attractive, albeit a little on the small side. Coming from London that's never a surprise for me, but if you like a roomy room, this isn't it, even when booking a deluxe room or a suite. 3) the bar, the 'Top of the Standard' has fantastic 360 views. It's a beautifully decorated space, it feels like walking into a glitzy Great Gasby party. We enjoyed live jazz almost every night we went there. Watch out though, drinks are pricey but worth it. 4) The location is great! very close to the high line, chelsea market and lots of restaurants. I don't like staying in the hustle bustle around 5th Ave, so found this area refreshing. What's not so good? A) The atmosphere. It's a weird mix of artsy pretensious and student dorm room. We were kept awake on night 1 by a loud group of revellers going into and out of their rooms/the hotel between 1am - 5am. B) The service. When we complained about the noise, the hotel's response was to move us to a room on the 17th floor. Great views, granted, but right beneath the hotel's nightclub. If you want a good nights rest, decline floor 17 (under nightclub) and floor 16 (under the 24h gym). Eventually, after a third night of no sleep, we were upgraded to a Hudson Suite.

Room service inadequate: we first ordered a tea and the assistant asked for all the dressings we liked instead of bringing them all; in-room breakfast in the morning after was not adequately presented. We were eventually charged with any items we used, which were apparently offered on courtesy basis. Positive impression on the whole, but I would rather advise it for a drink at the rooftop's Boom Boom Room than staying overnight.

We live in NYC, but decided to have a staycation at The Standard, as our friends were coming from out of town, and I had made arrangements for them to room there. As I pulled up in my taxi from a long Saturday at the office, I instantly felt transported and ready for an exciting evening. The reception had a Swiss Chalet vibe- warm and inviting lounge area at the entrance- mix of well dressed travelers, and NY locals, drinks flowing, and a great atmosphere. When I arrived to our room, my husband told me that he had taken our 11 yr old daughter skating at the Ice Rink in front of the hotel, and continued to tell me how nicely he had been treated by Paul Kashman, a Standard Exec., who had helped to arrange our weekend. Paul had our room prepared slightly earlier than expected as he saw our daughter had overexerted herself while skating, needing some R&R, and something warm to drink. A bowl of chicken soup arrived for our daughter instantly, and my husband was able to check in and enjoy the rest of the afternoon. When our friends arrived in the evening- we proceeded to a lovely dinner at The Standard Grill, and after party at Top of The Standard. The evening fantastically executed - no stone left unturned. The view and decor at Top of The Standard is truly spectacular, one of the most beautiful rooms in NYC. (A must see even for a New Yorker) The next morning, we awoke to a beautiful sunrise above the Hudson River- from our room's floor to ceiling windows, and amazingly comfortable bed.

This review, though, may be a little tainted by my disappointment in the High Line which I found too antiseptic and too hemmed in by new construction and gentrification.I had a comfortable stay and nice bright room, but to me, the hotel is over-priced. I doubt many of its rooms actually end up going for the published list price, but I ended up paying in the 300s using Hotel Tonight and it wasn't worth that much to me given other choices I know I could have made. (A note: the offers on Hotel Tonight for the High Line varied, sometimes going down to the lower 200s -- I would have judged that price worth it).I don't know if my room was typical (825) but if it was, people with major disabilities or very large people (like 6'2"") should be forewarned: the layout of the room includes a large combo tub/shower that is glassed in on the bed side and has an open side where you enter that is about 3 ft high and you have to step over it. I also don't think some one over 6 ft could get his/her head under the shower head. The toilet itself is a closet toilet, very narrow.

Besides, the rooms are really small, well furnished but old style ; the wifi connection is really bud; the wardrobe is almost inexistent (no place for t-shirts, socks etc); and last reproach but the worth : they refuse us the entrance to the bar at the top floor because we had sneakers (golden goos shoes ) : there is door selection inside the hotel for the customers !!!!!!It's absolutely UNACCEPTABLE for a RESPECTABLE hotel, to make a selection to the hotel's bar for the guests (who paid a lot to be there): the selection is over since the 90's and we are in 2015!!!

The common areas are cool. And I loved that the walls in my 15th floor room were mostly glass; the views were tremendous.But a hotel room is a place to sleep in, at the end of the day (rimshot). And the music throbbing through my room until 4 am made that impossible for me. Maybe Le Bain had a particularly loud DJ the night I stayed there, or maybe my room has some bizarre acoustic coupling to the sound system up on 18th floor where the club is. I find it hard to believe that guests from at least the 15th floor up are expected to like being shook all night long by the base lines from one hit after another (which, as I learned, have just enough variety to be constantly annoying instead of eventually soothing to a wannabe sleeper), but maybe that's part of this hotel's brand.If so, I wish they'd have told me so I could have stayed somewhere else.","Cambridge, Massachusetts","DoINeedaVisa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cambridge, Massachusetts</strong>",17,2.0

Some aspects were great, others were just not at all. I don't like giving bad reviews (if you look at my reviews, you'll see most of them are 4 or 5 stars) so I'm struggling here. For a young couple or a group of 30 somethings, this hotel would probably be a 5 star experience. For us, very spoiled not-so-young people it didn't make it.Location: I'm going to start with the best part. Location is tops. We usually stay in Tribeca or Soho, this was our first venture into the meatpacking district. It was pretty great. A fun, hip neighborhood that also manages to be quaint in a strange way. 5 starsThe Room/The common areas: We had a Hudson Suite, with views on three sides. The views were terrific. The bed was very comfortable and the little seating area was cool. Those are the good parts. Now the bad. I don't consider something that is all one room to be a suite. I book suites because my husband is an early riser and I'm not, I like for him to have a place to go so I can keep sleeping once he's up. This is NOT a suite, it's one biggish room. Speaking of which...those pictures with the sexy bathtub, glassed in shower? Those are pictures OF THE ROOM. There is no separate bathroom. Mercifully the toilet is enclosed but everything else is just out there. I wanted to have my sister over for drinks but it just felt like we would be hanging out in the bathroom with our toiletries and used towels all over the place. Also, I'm not a prude but I like to shower privately and also like there to be doors or walls on all sides of the shower. In addition to being in full view, the glassed in shower is open on one side, which made me chilly while i was showering. We did request a shower curtain to provide some privacy on the three glassed in sides and this was provided. The bathroom being in the room made the room even less of a suite. Our first night in the room, Friday, we were up until 4 am, hearing and feeling the bass of house music/EDM. As we were on the 6th floor and the club is on the 18th, we couldn't figure out what we were hearing/feeling. In the morning, we told the hotel we would have to leave if there wasn't a quieter room. They also seemed puzzled as to where the noise was coming from but thought it might have the bar next door (brass monkey). They moved us to the 13th floor, which was better but did not eliminate the problem. We solved it ourselves by getting intoxicated enough to pass out. To make up for the bad night we had on Friday, the hotel gave us a $100 food and beverage credit, which was nice of them to do. As for common areas, the lobby isn't much of anything but I don't fault them for that, space is at a premium. If you are someone who likes to hang in the lobby, this isn't the place for you. My husband used the gym and said it was fine. We never went to the club (Le Bain) or the rooftop. Food: We got room service once (it was delivered promptly) and though it was simple (soup and omlette), it was very good. We also ate at the Standard Grill (using our FB credit) for brunch. It's a cool venue and the food was very good, as was the service.Service: Service here ran the gamut from great to indifferent. Kyle, who helped us solve our room problem with a credit and a move was great. Room service was great. Engineering (had to come to the room to deliver a curtain for the shower and to fix the tv) was great. Valet service was good. Bell service was okay. Front desk service was indifferent at times, pretty good at other times. Here is an example: I called at 9:30 am on Saturday to discuss the horrible night we had the previous night. Kyle arranged a new room, gave us the $100 credit and told us to pack our stuff and if we were out of the room they would just move everything for us. We left the room at 10. We got back at 2:45, went to the front desk to figure out whether we should be going to our old room or our new one and discovered nothing had been done, in fact the front desk didn't seem to know what we were talking about. Then the woman at the desk said she saw the notes and that our room would be ready ""in a few minutes"" and they would call us in our old room to let us know. One hour later, no one had called. I called guest services and ended speaking to kyle again. He said someone would be right up to help us move. 20 minutes later someone showed up. That kind of typifies the experience we had. Similarly, when we checked in, our bags took about 25 minutes to get to the room. BUT I will say this, I think a BIG part of the problem with the bag delivery and the bellman getting to our room to help us move was simply the horrible elevators. We waited 10 minutes for an elevator to move us to the new room. that might not sound like a lot but seriously, ten minutes waiting for an elevator is nuts. Checking out took 20 minutes. There was a short line but for most of the time, only one guy at the front desk. When I finally got up there, the FB credit was not on the bill. I had a feeling it wouldn't be which is why i waited in line instead of doing an express check out. It all got solved but it was very aggravating. A 338 room hotel needs more than one or even two people at the desk during peak times. As far as the issues with the bellmen, I think that was elevator driven more than staff driven. Value: At $867 a night, I wasn't thrilled. The hotel was really full though so they must be doing something right. Oh, there is free wifi which I do appreciate, especially since we, like most people, have multiple devices. I'm tired of being nickled and dimed with wifi charges.",Washington DC,"dicooley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC</strong>",68,3.0

As we've visited New York previously I had never stayed ""West"" before, and I have to say there's no other neighbourhood for me, but let's start with the hotel.The hotel is tucked away in Meatpacking under the gorgeous HighLine, with a discreet Yellow entrance the hotel oozes style from the moment you walk in. Fabulous staff greet and meet their guests, check in is swift and your bags are (as you'd expect) are casually taken to your room. We stayed on the 12th Floor with a Hudson View room. The rooms are again, super cool - not the largest but pretty standard sized when compared to other NY rooms I've stayed in. What is different is the quality of the furnishings, the uber cool bathrooms and beds (bar far the most comfortable I've slept on!). Then there's the mini bar - i honestly have never seen such a well stocked fridge and snack bar! Nice work. Apart from the location, the super cool staff, the amazing view, the fabulous roof bar ,""those cool lifts"" that had the world media going crazy this year, our most impressive element of this trip was the Concierge. Elijah was tremendous. As we wanted a different NY experience we asked him for recommendations for things to do and he didn't disappoint. Musical Comedy, Restaurants, Hot theatre tickets - he never disappointed us. Def stay at this hotel if we want to enjoy a casual but cool experience, fab restaurant too. I was mesmerised by the cool flooring made from thousands of pennies. The West Village is a lovely area to stay whilst you're staying in NY, great places to eat and party. Located right near the hudson, the runs to Brooklyn Bridge are amazing too. Will totally return.Thank you",England - UK,"Mike_Ellis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>England - UK</strong>",15,5.0

The High Line park is a big reason for that. The former elevated train structure has been converted into a 1.5 mile linear park connecting several west Manhattan landmarks, and spurring new development along the way. Within a short walk of The Standard, you'll find stylish shops (All Saints, Scoop, etc), cool restaurants (Catch, The Standard Grill), and soon, a cultural anchor (Whitney Museum of American Art) expected to bring millions of annual visitors to the area. We loved the energy of the area and it's only getting better.The Standard itself is one of Andre Balazs' intelligently conceived contemporary concepts that blends flat out high design with a dose of cheeky flippancy that - assuming it hits you right - is sleek blended with a youthful sense of humor. If you're in the mood for fun, The Standard has it all - rooftop bar, exclusive nightclub, Biergarten, sexy crowd, on and on. If you're in the mood for pampering, this is NOT a good choice.The good news is that this property was design built as opposed to being renovated from some other use. That means that the spaces work, generally speaking. That being said, it IS NEW York so rooms are tight. Fair Warning: though the beds are quite sleep worthy, this is NOT a plush room. The beds are low to the floor and furnishings are quite minimalist. The standard king will get you a bench, small table and a chair so short it might match the scale of your young child's playroom. There are no drawers, the emphasis being on the highly useful MINIBAR, which offers bottles of booze and other accessories in keeping with your overall goal at The Standard - carrying on the party at all times!The SHOWER. You'll either love it or hate it. See through from nearly every vantage point in a room not much larger than a London phone booth, it's designer simply says to you, ""sex."" I say, ""why not?"" but you might say, ""really?"" At the end of the day, it's all in good fun.The service level was really excellent. At all points, we were impressed with the training level and consistency of staff in friendliness and timeliness from the valet to the concierge to the cocktail waitresses in the nightclub we started calling the ""Boom Boom Room"" (Le Bain). Quintessential New York, the Boom Boom Room was one of the highlights of this property for us. Stunning build out, panoramic views of the City and the river, live music, sublime martinis...it's close to perfect. If you're there, it's worth dressing up, heading upstairs and spending more money than you want to!Have fun. It's expensive but The Standard offers a truly rich experience in the Meatpacking District.","Scottsdale, Arizona","josephbla</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Scottsdale, Arizona</strong>",79,4.0

The person at the reception was just so unkind. Not a word asking about us ""having good trip"". We are french and speak correct english but she was speaking so fast, with no efforts of repeating ! All week-end there was a huge queue at the lift at any time of day or night. We wanted to go at the famous terrasse at the roof top. They told us that there was so many people going there that we could not go during the week-end by the usual lift but must go out the building to the building next door, take a place in the line and then take the lift from that other building (really easy !). We tried on sunday. There was plenty people waiting, then they stamped us a mark on the arm to be recognized !! than they asked us to open our bags and to leave them at the vestiaire (incredible !!). Finally we did no go and waited our last day of stay (monday) to go back to this terrasse, this time through the hotel lifts because you can go through the hotel lift only during the week. The Wi-Fi did not work in our room witch is just unbelievable in 2014 and with this category of hotel. Food was correct but not more. Hamburgers correct but not really good, french fries awfully salted... Servers were more obsessed by their look and their image rather than any efficiency or service. Beware the fact that we were perfectly dressed, we also could not access to the lounge bar because we were wearing sneakers (I understand that there might be a dress code, but hotel should prevent its clients). To be complete, I have to say that after complaining, the persons at the front desk and the front-desk manager have been very kind. They arranged on the second day a special wi-fi in our room, and did what they could in order to be agreeable to us. I also must say that the building is nice, the room small but beautifully decorated and very clean. I personally find the lobby and the lifts sad and sinister ! In total inconsistency with the nice rooms decoration. This place does not worth any more its reputation.",,157philg,41,1.0

Things you should know: the rooms are extremely small, and the bathroom is entirely open (apart from the toilet). If you or your partner want some privacy while showering, you might want to keep this in mind. High speed internet is a joke here, so don't bother paying anything extra for internet (we called to the tech support and they were unable to improve anything). Beds are very average in terms of comfort.Worse, is the situation with the elevators. You have to always swipe your card, and if you don't do it in time, your in for a long ride in the elevator. The card readers are terrible, and the hotel key cards are constantly becoming demagnetized (in 3 days we had to get 2 new sets of keys issued). We also saved multiple people in the elevator who were taking trips up and down due to failed keys. Fails on the basics: In the rain, no doormen to help you with your bags out of a taxi, or even out of the lobby (was not even offered by the staff).Noise: this is a party hotel and that's ok. However I don't expect the pipes and walls to hum anytime I or someone nearby takes a shower. Water pressure is so high its having some affect upon the pipes.Lastly- don't expect any preference when trying to book a table at the restaurants. Just because you are a hotel guest doesn't entitle you to any preference vs the normal public.The positives: Location, and the front desk and concierge are helpful and friendly. Clearly the hotel management doesn't care to actually manage the property. They are banking on their location and the name. There isn't actually that much style at this hotel. If you are going to spend this kind of money, stay at the Nomad, Conrad, Andaz or even dare I say a W.

Although there was a long line to check in at the front desk on Saturday around 6pm, I was immediately greeted by the concierge who informed me that one of the front desk agents would be with me shortly. He went on to introduce himself and I regret to say I forgot his name, tall younger gentleman with dark hair. He let me know if there was anything he could do for me he would be happy to assist and that is when I asked him for a reservation at the Standard Grill that evening I was unable to make beforehand. He informed me that the only availability that night for 2 was at 10:30. I inquired about the chef's counter and he went ahead and called the restaurant and made a reservation for me and my guest at 9pm. I was truly pleased with his assistance, he was pleasant and accommodating, thank you! Check in was very easy, efficient and quick, no complaints. My room was facing the empire state building, absolutely gorgeous view to wake up too. I called the front desk to inform them about a small stain I saw on the bed cover and she was apologetic and informed me she would send someone to replace the linen. I was out of my room at 9pm and when I returned later that evening, my linen was completely replaced, bed was remade and new towels were placed in the room. Extremely efficient room service. I dined at the Standard Grill and was a few minutes late for my reservation. I checked in at the host stand and they informed me they were working on a table for me. Although my guest and I would have preferred the chef's counter anyway, they were very accommodating in providing us with a table in the dining room. The hostess, tall, blonde hair with bangs was very sweet. Service at the grill was fantastic, no complaints. Food was equally delicious, drinks were made to perfection, my guest and I had fantastic dining experience. We then went upstairs to the Top of The Standard, formally known as the ""Boom Boom Room"" and had a few drinks. Great music, great people watching and fantastic service by the bartenders. I cannot express enough how impressed I was with the service and hospitality starting from the front desk, to the service at the Grill and Bar upstairs. Everyone was so accommodating and helpful with all of my requests. I cannot wait to return to the Standard in the future.

At check in I asked if my room had a bath, I was told yes, it didn't. I had booked a liberty corner room which ended up on a low floor and the view was awful, I said I was not happy and was moved, the only thing available was a smaller room on a higher floor for one night followed by an empire corner (totally different view, but nice none the less) we were given some champagne for our inconvienince, which was nice, but I would rather have not felt I was not getting what I ordered. The liberty corner room on a low floor (we got 7th) is not a nice view at all. When we checked in we were told entrance to the nightlife was up to the door staff and no offer of being able to make a reservation was made, yet when we went to the top of the standard there were reservations for all the tables and we had wait for a cancellation to get one. We called the conceirge to get a table at the standard grill and were told they were fully booked, so we looked on top table and got a table at the fully booked restaurant no problems... We checked out a week ago and there is still a block on my credit card for over £2000 even though the full bill has been settled from that card, I have emailed them to clarify this but they have not responded.Apart from me saying what I was annoyed about, there were some positives, the guys who helped us with our bags was brilliant, very helpful and friendly, top man! The room we got from our second night was lovely, I really liked it, great view, lovely bed, it was of the quality I expected when booking such a venue. When we actually ate at the standard grill the food was fantasic, so was the service, I would recommend eating there.Basically they have a great venue, some rooms will be over priced due to building work happening since they opened, which they need to address, the different elements need to be a little more joined up, and they certainly should be focusing on making sure their guests get to use the facilities of their hotel with as little effort as possible. Everyone I spoke to seemed to want to help, it just somehow didn't work as well as it should, based on that I will probably stay somewhere else when I next visit New York, curiosity may take me back in a few years to see if they have got things together...",,Nick H,21,3.0

It's trendy, has a great location, and rooms with a view! My most recent stay however, didn't have the magic I've come to expect from The Standard.Complaints: Top of the Standard was closed, there was this monster air conditioner right by the elevator on floor 11, reception desk less than helpful, and very slow room service. Also, I wasn't upgraded but one of my coworkers was. Maybe they only do it on your first few stays? Maybe I wasn't dressed up enough after a day in Central Park? Maybe I came in at an odd hour? I don't know. I also find it odd that french fries took several hours. We were asleep by the time it was delivered.Positives: Trendy, quick check-in and check-out, cabs know where it is, room service is always very conscientious as are the bell staff. Rooms are always clean, and there's always something to do at the hotel or in the nearby area.I have always loved this hotel.

It was immediately apparent that the genius of Andre Balazs is both his attention to detail in anticipating traveller's needs as well as his reinvention of the overall hotel guest experience. And The Standard High Line delivers on both, and more. The Standard High Line is much more than a hotel - it's hospitality with style and a touch of theatre. The drama of the elevator journey to your room sets the scene which is carried through to all of the public spaces. Service was excellent, friendly & professional, (both at check-in, an early check-in was requested & received) and throughout our stay (and a special mention to Justin K who made breakfast a cheerful start to the day).

Our room, (on the 13th floor), was totally quiet and the bed was one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. The views from the room were awesome too. My only complaints are 1) their Wi-Fi is so so slow. You can upgrade to a faster service for about $20 a day but I feel one shouldn't have to do that with the price you're already paying. A decent Wi-Fi service should be expected. 2) the lifts - it could take ages waiting for one, not a great inconvenience granted but could be annoying... 3) the non-access to the club for residents.

The rooms have corner sofas wrapped around an adjustable height table that is great for meals,dropped to coffee table for entertaining and even makes a unbeatable travel office!And the Staff!! From my first contact through creative solutions to an Internet issue, this staff has really rocked my world. I would go so far as to say that the service here is the best that i have ever had.

There was busy road underneath but the noise was bearable, not too disturbing. Apparently I was upgraded but the room was really small. The bathroom did not have a door and there was glass wall between the bed and the tiny half size bath tub. You could be showering and looking at NY skyline. It is OK when you are by yourself, I suppose. Amenities are very basic: no shower cup or slippers, I had to request the latter. Bathrobes are very heavy and not from towel like material. I know they were fresh but somehow did not feel like it so I did not use them. I had 4 towels each size provided each day and linens were changed daily as requested (and tipped) which I appreciated. The room was very clean at all times. There is no proper wardrobe due to lack of space, just rail with curtain and five hangers. It was challenging as I was there for a week. The views from the large windows are not obstructed and really amazing, I would say even therapeutic. I could watch the sunset. The air con blew only cold air so I was advised to switch it off for the room to warm up. There is always plenty of people around the hotel due to night club, restaurant and roof terrace on premises. I have used last two and it was nice but most of the days there was no table available although I was a guest. I tried room service once and it was prompt at midnight but burger was average. My flight was late and the lady at the reception very kindly extended my check out until 3 pm, something that never happens in the chain hotel.

I arrived mid afternoon to The Standard with 3 bags for a 5 day stay and there was no one to one to acknowledge me & I had to wait 15 minutes to check in - then was pointed to the lift. When I asked if someone could bring my bags to the room, I was told to leave them and someone would bring them up. The staff that served me, was most unhelpful and certainly unfriendly - not the welcome I was expecting.I got to me room & then had make 2 phone calls to chase me bags and waited 45 minutes for them to arrive as 'they couldn't be located'. When I expressed my frustration to the staff member, his words were 'no one really cares, no point complaining, really busy, understaffed, should write a report on trip adviser'.... this pretty much sums up the attitude over the next 5 days.At no point when I went through the foyer was I ever acknowledged by anyone - I felt no one really bothered if I was there for the nightclub or paying over $600 a night for a room. I came and went from the hotel several times and other than first thing in the morning, I often had to wait for 3 lifts to come to get to me room (as was so busy), I could not get into the nightclub on 2 occasions even though I was staying in the hotel, at The Grill, even though there were only a few tables and plenty of staff, I had to ask 4 times if I could order breakfast (wait for 'right' waiter to serve me). My departure was even a worst experience as we packed our bags and vacated our room at 8am to have out bags brought down when housekeeping was ready. We arrived back at the hotel at 3pm and it took 40 minutes to locate our bags - when they finally brought our bags , 1 was missing and the staff could not have been more unhelpful or unfazed if they tried. We were risking missing our flight - when I asked to speak to the manager, I was told 'Paul on duty but not around and the M.D was called Kevin & I could complain to him'. When staff behind the counter could see that I was getting concerned & my husband had gone with security to find our missing bag, not one person made an effort to assist. The arrival & departure when travelling leave the biggest impact. The room was noisy, pretty modest relative to the price and the air conditioning was so high in the hotel, we were desperate to be outside. This all could be overcome - what left a lasting impression was the incredible lack of 'hospitality' and 'service' and the staff culture within the hotel of arrogance. This, I believe to stem from leadership - or lack of. Fortunately I loved everything else about my trip to N.Y and will return again and again, will just be more selective about where I stay.","London, England, United Kingdom","SandraRLondon</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, England, United Kingdom</strong>",10,1.0

The earplugs that the hotel provides are definitly not useless, especially during the weekend. The highline standard is located on one of the busiest places in the meatpacking district. The amenities of the Hotel are good and the gym is absolutly great! Amazing views. The standard grill is really nice. The rooftop bar was a big deception. First of all not everybody is allowed to take his camera to the rooftop bar, and till today i didn't understand the selection criterias. Anyway it's a quite strange idea to close the rooftop bar during a few days in summer to do some renovation works ( during our stay of 7 nights we only could use the rooftop bar on our 6 th night). And last but not least the attitude of some staff members of the rooftop bar is absolutly not professional, they treat you like underlings and ask you to free your table for another groupe because those will probably drink more than you and your party does!!! They don't care that you are an hotel guest. These staff members seem to forget that it is not because they are working at a 5 star hotel that they can treat guests of these hotels in an arrogant way. It's quite impressive to notice that nowadays in such hotels, you can still find these attitudes among staff members. I complained about this fact at the rooftopbar's supervisor, and this guy tried at least to apologize by offering to refund our drinks. Good point for him and his professional attitude.

I'm writing my review now while I'm still here, so I never have to think about this awful place again.Firstly, the physical complaints. The room is too small. The bed is low to the floor, feeling like a futon (apparently all of the rooms are the same). The bathroom has no privacy (with only timber shutters between the bed and the bathroom) which allows all light and noise from the bathroom to be seen and heard at the bed. This is absolutely unworkable for a couple travelling together experiencing jetlag who might need to use the bathroom at different times. Basically, the rooms do NOT look at all like the hotel photographs and are wearing very poorly despite their relatively recent age.On of the pillow cases had approx ten separate holes in it. One of our towels was torn. One of our towels had fluorescent yellow stains all over it. We requested a couple of extra pillows - they were delivered to us without pillow cases! Our hall light flicked on and off all week - no one came to fix it. It's just rubbish.But you know what, the complaints about the physical aspects of the hotel really are nothing compared to the environment the hotel creates for its guests, and the treatment by the staff. When events are held at the rooftop venues, they reserve two of the four lifts for the functions - leaving over 300 rooms to share two lifts. Usually I had to wait more than five minutes to get a lift.On two separate occasions during our week we went to parts of the hotel where people had just vomited - in public areas, during the day.The hotel supplies you with earplugs because all of the venues are noisy at night. Right now, I can hear a bar full of people singing along to 'Killing me Softly' and 'No Diggity'. Lol.This property is essentially a bar complex, with rooms. The room guests are a very low priority and treated very poorly. The staff apologise but do nothing and I think they suffer a lot of complaints. They never answered 'yes' to any request. I could not compliment a single staff member from the week, except for a breakfast waitress who was lovely.The location suited us very well but there is no way I would ever stay in this place again. You know what, this hotel failed in so many ways I can't be bothered typing any more about it. I can't think of anyone I know who would accept this type of treatment at a hotel.Oh one last thing. Usually, when the hotel receives a bad review, they suggest the reviewer contact Julie in their Executive Office to help them next time they come to stay. Please don't suggest that to me, it is an absolute insult. Your staff did not do a single thing to help me enjoy my stay while I was here and I'm not coming again.","Brisbane, Australia","alittlebitfussy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",12,1.0

I'm not sure what was deluxe about the room I was upgraded to, but according to the web site, the superior room I booked was larger, so I may have been better off staying with that.The good:- Great views. I was looking south/southwest over the highline, and out towards the river.- Pleasant service. Everyone from the bell staff to the front desk staff were very friendly, and everything was ""can do.""The bad:- I spend a lot of time in New York. I have a pretty good feeling as to the typical room sizes in the city, and the room I had was small. Very small.- The bathroom is interesting, with the entire room tiled and with a rim separating it from the hallway. This proved to be necessary, because the rain shower is only separated from the rest of the bathroom by a narrow glass wall that shelters the sink from it, but the water level begins to rise as you use the shower. The entire area in front of the sink was soaked to the point that I had to lay down some dry towels to have someplace to stand as I finished getting ready.- No ""real"" ironing board, a strange little half board.Caveat emptor on parking: they advertise a $55/day rate on their web site. If you are parked a minute over 24 hours, an additional $55 will apply. Additionally, there's a $20/day SUV upcharge that wasn't indicated on their web site or at check-in that I was surprised with. I received an emailed folio after departing with $150 in parking when I was expecting $55.The location on the High Line is great, and the lobby and surrounding areas are certainly trendy, but I think for the price, I'll try another property on my next visit.","San Francisco, California","BayAreaChris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",7,2.0

I chose the Standard Hotel because of its unique location and what look like beautiful rooms with incredible views. I reserved the Hudson Studio weeks in advance as it had a large bath in the middle of the room, a rain shower, and of course expansive views of the Hudson and Manhattan. It looked like a definite winner of a room.Unfortunately, the day we checked in there was plumbing issue that took out two studios. We wound up taking a downgraded room upon the recommendation of Paul the Director of the Front Office. First impression, the room was a good size and had a spectacular view of the lower Manhattan, the World Trade Center, and the Hudson River. As New York City is my hometown, it was especially nice to see it from this angle. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover there was a large and deep bath for two and adjacent rain shower in the corner of the room. All the right ingredients for what I was originally looking for. Although not what we originally planned, we had a very positive experience. All the staff seemed friendly, helpful and the quality of services was great.

Since I stayed during the weekend the location of the hotel becomes a party scene but I'm 25 so I don't mind. The room was a nice size! My shower was great because you can see inside the shower from the bed :-) lol great for couples not so much for family's. The bed was very low to the grown but it was also very comfortable.

From the moment I stepped out of my cab I was greeted on the street by an attendant who took my bags. Staff were (mostly) polite and discreet and check in was fairly smooth. I found aspects of the hotel nauseatingly trendy for my liking and the clientele who frequented the bars upstairs made me want to hide out in my room and order room service. I went to the top floor for a drink and was greeted by - no exaggeration - an 8' tall Amazonian hostess in a gold dress. A little disconcerting but I guess that's the point. The bar was golden everything, the light, ambiance and the views were stunning. Good service and I know I was paying for an experience but 1 miniature hamburger, a cube of tuna and two cocktails later and an $80 bill - seriously?!The room itself was small. I have experienced this in every hotel in NYC I have stayed at but thought that, at $500 a night, at least spatially, things would be marginally more generous. Inside, the credenza was scratched and chipped which seemed tacky. The bathroom had an awkward layout - the shower was completely open which left big puddles everywhere. The proximity of the toilet to the bed did not make for a romantic experience. The tub was deliciously large and deep and they included some nice quality bubble bath. Also, no garbage bin in the bathroom which was odd. We could hear quite a bit of surrounding noise, yelling from the bar, neighbors etc - though not so bad as to prevent sleeping. The bed was very comfortable though a tight squeeze next to the wall. Lovely wood panelling in the room. In the morning, due to a lack of available resources to make coffee in the room I ordered a bagel, coffee and juice - $38 bill. Again, seriously?! Enjoyed the room and the floor to ceiling views all morning only to discover - after walking around topless - to my great amusement, a construction worker watching me from a nearby skyscraper - with binoculars!! Note: keep the sheer curtains drawn!The pitch black elevator with video spiralling through space was not so novel the next morning and it took forever to get my luggage from storage later in the day but overall, fairly seamless and pleasant. The lobby is small for the size of the hotel and the aesthetic feels a bit ten years ago, design wise.Overall, I would say - not particularly great value but if you have money to burn, go for it. Enjoy the views, The HighLine (which is great by the way), the ambiance, the $20 cocktails.","Toronto, Canada","Diane R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",3,4.0

On arrival at the hotel, it instantly came apparent about the cosmopolitan image. The room was extremely small (typical NYC), but was designed well.  Unfortunately even though we had booked a river side view, we were given a city view room. Reception were very apologetic and explained they were unable to move us that day but would move us the following day whilst we were out. We reminded them in the morning before we went out for the day and again we got reassured that our bags would be moved. On our return we still had the same room, after a 30minute wait at reception they finally corrected our room, albeit a smaller room than we had paid for, however we had a river side view. They then also gave us a bottle of prosecco as an apology. As hotel residents we were hoping to go to the hotels Boom Boom bar, unfortunately to access this bar you have to queue in the street outside on a weekend, so we never made it.On check out of the hotel we discovered we had 15GBP taken from our bag. We understood that the hotel wouldn’t be able to compensate this but we thought they should know in case any other residents had also had money taken. We were disgusted at the receptionists response who explained that she couldn’t speak about it and that we needed to put a complaint into security direct.

We paid extra to have what appeared to be a lovely tub, but when I went to use it the handle literally fell off.The service at this hotel was nothing short of snobby in a place that has absolutely nothing to be snobby about. We have stayed at budget hotels and high end hotels around the world and nowhere can I recall encountering a ruder group of people. Their ""holier than thou"" attitude when asked to fix things (e.g., the broken off tub handle was met with ""I'll have someone check to see if there is an issue with your tub"") was unbelievable to me. In their view ""the management's always right"" rather than the customer. Truly, I've never, never encountered this kind of attitude anywhere.The restaurant next door was pretty darn awful as well. I would write more about that but I've pushed that particular experience out of my mind. All I really can remember was that the meal was greasy beyond belief (although the service there was pretty good).The one good thing thing about this hotel is its location alongside the High Line, which we walked once mid-day on a Saturday (very sunny and extremely crowded) and early Sunday morning (7:30 am - beautify weather, nobody there). I'd obviously recommend the Sunday morning walk.My advice, though -- save your money and stay in a nicer, cheaper place and take a cab (or walk) to the High Line early one morning to walk it.

I went to the Chelsea market each morning to pick up coffee, pastries, etc.Overall, it was an interesting experience for both of us - we wanted to stay by the High Line/Chelsea Market area - but, in my view, there are better and cheaper hotels in NYC than the Standard High Line.","Toronto, Canada","Constantine D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",147,3.0

Let me explain. My husband and I just got back from NYC; we stayed at the Standard High Line. The hotel is slick and bright, from the yellow revolving door to the music and lights in the elevator. Check-in was speedy and efficient. Even though we arrived very early, there was a room available for us.The rooms are small, yes, but well appointed. The floor to ceiling windows and airy feeling of the decor made the room look bigger than it was. The seating area was great for breakfast and everything (except the wifi) worked perfectly. Oh and the rattle in the AC on high, but it wasn't hot enough to need that. The bed was INSANELY comfortable. The peek-a-boo shower was nifty, lots of towels, and nice toiletries. The location just can't be beat - every morning my husband walked to Chelsea Market for coffee and fresh delights for breakfast. There are so many great restaurants around the area, and the High Line is such a wonderful urban park.So. Back to the drawers. There aren't any. Drawers I mean. We spent several minutes actually looking for a shelf or bank of drawers - nothing. So we hung everything up. The only other comment I can make is that the wifi only worked reliably in the toilet. We didn't try to get into the rooftop - frankly we're probably not hip enough, from comments I've read on TA. :) After walking for miles and miles each day, we didn't feel a need to use the gym; we didn't frequent any of the eateries either - maybe another time.Overall, we enjoyed the property for the location and the sleep quality, and the views.","Toronto, Canada","Jane P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",49,4.0

It was a great experience. Convenient location - perfect if you like running along the Hudson - and not far away from most of New York attractions. Check in was quick and efficient. The size of the room was OK; bigger than in many other NYC hotels I have staid in. The hotel atmosphere is, what should I call it; playful? Lots of stylish guests looking for fun and shopping in New York. The well known spots on the top of the hotel is worth a visit; if you are able to get in! I have been at the Boom boom boom room a few times, and it is a fun place, but nothing extra ordinary. Breakfast is very good. Expect to pay around 30 usd for a healthy and tasty start of your day. The only thing that annoyed me in this hotel is related to the elevators and entrance to the roof top. After a certain point of time in the evening, you are forced to take a real round trip to either get back to your room; not to mention get back to the roof top! I ended up in a rather hefty discussion with the doorman on the street after going for a quick stop in my room. It was close to impossible to persuade him into guiding me to the rooftop and my friends. I should be possible to create a more convenient system for hotel guests and entrance to the roof top. Apart from that; this is a hotel well worth a visit. As for the price; 1000 usd for two nights. Worth it?

I did as i always do before staying, I read trip advisors reviews. I read the worst ones and looked at the dates to see if they were current and they were, complaints ranging from A to Z. There were many more great reviews than bad, but enough bad to concern me. We had friends that had already booked there and I had previously agreed to come and stay. So changing hotel was not going to happen, I was going to have to suck it up and make the best of It.Well lets just say that I am glad I did. The Standard is in the Meatpacking District, which is crazy busy, energetic , great party , food, drink, shopping. My experience was amazing, from the minute I pulled up to park, It was a bit difficult to find front entrance to hotel because of how busy area is. But within seconds I had a couple of Valets / Bellman come over and ask me if I was looking for the Standard Hotel. From here on I have to say every single person I encountered, Valet , Bellman, Front Desk, Security, Housekeeping was extremely pleasant and always wanting to help. I booked through Hotel Tonight and got a great rate. Front desk offered a couple different floor options, 17 or 12, said the only difference would be noise. Rooftop bar is basically open all night and she said for noise purposes she would recommend the 12th floor.We took her advice, I loved the room. It was small of course, but this is new york. The room was very Clean, cozy , almost like a cruise ship room in all the good ways, the bed was low , pretty much sitting on floor, we had floor to ceiling window views of the hudson river and The Freedom Tower. Shower head was rain shower with great pressure, A huge tube that fits two easily is in room. Very large mini bar assortment . We ate breakfast at hotel restaurant which is out front of hotel entrance. (forgot name) but that was excellent. We had drinks at The Top of the Standard and brunch there on Sunday, it was AMAZING! The drinks are made to perfection and the french toast and burger bites were incredible.As I right this review I am trying to find and point out any negatives, and the only one is that being a hotel guest does not give you any leverage at all for entry to clubs, wait on line like everyone else. I knew this before hand , so it was a none issue. I am already looking at whichweekend I can return!!","Port Chester, New York","Chris10573</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Chester, New York</strong>",16,5.0

I always loved the Standard (as prominently displayed in my app of the West Village). My room was on the 4th floor looking north with a nice view of the high line and the Empire State building. Just be aware that constructions has started on an empty lot across the street and that within 1 year or so, views of the Empire State Building might become obstructed. I arrived really early after a red eye and was lucky my room was ready. The staff was efficient and professional. As you probably read on previous reviews, no double beds, only king beds and no real privacy since the shower/tub is behind a glass window (though it's very sexy if you ask me). Don't worry, the toilet has plenty of privacy. A well stocked minibar, nice little seating area and lots of light. The bed was super comfortable and I slept really well. I stayed a Saturday night and the whole area around the hotel turns into a mini Las Vegas which is pretty gross but the hotel has excellent security and I did not hear any street noise from my room. Amazing drinks and views from the Top of The Standard which is the bar lounge on its top floor. Strict dress code so don't show up with flip flops and shorts. Also, being nice and polite goes a long way. Great food at the Grill or grab drinks and some pizza on the plaza (during the warm month) or ice skate in the winter. And because you are right on the High Line Park take a very early stroll when it opens. It is so much better when no one is on it. After 11AM it's very crowded.

They have a restaurants downstairs, also a beer garden but, while we were there the 2014 Brazil world cup was on so pretty difficult to get in. However we got upstairs on the rooftop garden with the best views to have a late drink or just relax. The problem with the other days we were here was that they had private events for either hollywood celebs, musicians or other PR events, this made it impossible for hotel guest as us to enter. When you pay from 400 US a night and UP i expect to get access to the hotel aminities. This was not the case here. I tried one evening to go up to take picture of the skyline, then i was stopped to go up because it was another private event, then i tried the other rooftop thru the restaurant, They have a dresscode, so i had to go downstairs again to change to formal attire and then go up to try, suddenly i got stopped again because i had camera equipment with me, i asked how to get to the roof with my camera, they said i couldnt access the roof with big lenses and huge camera equipment. I only had a mid sizes camera and after discussing with the security people that my cameras were small enough i got in only for private pictures. But this was only because i desagreed. In my opinion this Hotel and these places are only for people that now certain people and have access to things normal people cant get too. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS RIPP OFF HOTEL, THEY ARE TREATING PEOPLE DIFFERENTLY. They want your cash but cant give the service we pay for if you arent a celeb or someone important.

We wanted to do New York in our age bracket, late 20's early 30s, and I suppose this hotel is it. As others have said here, it is 'Hip', has a great location, but beyond that, it is an overpriced disappointment. The location is great, as are the views from the rooms, and the hotel is surrounded by great restaurants, bars and coffee shop/cafes, as well as having a very safe feel around the streets at most times of the day and night. The Brass Monkey around the corner was GREAT!The rooms are small but comfortable, clean, but NOT quiet… and this is where it falls down. We got the feel that as a hotel guest you come second. Second to the customers from outside, who come for the Bars and the rooftop Nightclub associated with the hotel. These seem to be the prime focus. Don't worry if you don't wish to attend the nightclub, you will still be able to listen to all the 'hip beats' being laid down upstairs while you are in your room trying to sleep at 2am! The noise travels waaaay down. If you want service, stay elsewhere, your every request seems a burden, and for the life of me I can't see what, other than the view, the attraction of these bars or the snotty nightclub upstairs is (you want in? you're a hotel guest ?, line up like everyone else pal… or just go to your room and listen, you'll be able to hear it!), the service in these is even WORSE! Ignored for 20 minutes just to order a beer in the cafe downstairs, then ignore for a further 15 while trying to pay the bill; oh but we still want to know why you didn't tip us …!!!!Coming back to your room after dinner or a night out? Try sharing a lift to your room with 20 drunken yobbo buffoons who are heading up to the rooftop club. Or even better, queue for a lift to your own hotel room because of this!

We found the staff had bad attitudes - on the night before we were being married in Central Park it rained heavily - so we were trying to make plans to marry upstairs in the hotel - no one returned our calls, or could help us - then we were told the manager wasn't there and we'd have to arrange in the morning - they'd call us first thing. No call. It was our wedding day and they couldn't have cared less. One night we asked them to book us into a restaurant. They said they did - but gave us the wrong name of the restaurant. It was our wedding night!!!!!!One redeeming feature - We stayed in the Liberty Suite for the 2 nights over our wedding which was stunning - with great spa in middle of room - and quite sizeable by New York standards.My husband had stayed in the hotel a few times before.

There are lots of great design elements that should raise this hotel above chain hotels, but it falls way short on the basics. Somehow the designers of the hotel lost sight of the idea that the rooms have to work as living spaces and the owners of the hotel have lost sight of the idea that a luxury hotel needs to be in great condition.The room was not in great condition. The adjustable height table was scratched, probably because people had dumped their suitcases there because there weren’t any other practical places to put suitcases. The otherwise comfortable king-size bed had threadbare sheets and a worn-out quilt, prompting a request for replacements. The shower head wasn’t properly attached to the wall and the toilet was reluctant to flush properly.As a living space the hotel was works badly. It starts in the lifts where it’s so dark that every guest has to grovel around in front of the button panel to find their floor. In the room, the light switches were baffling – it took thirty minutes to find them and understand how they all worked. The light in the shower room was so dim that you could barely see what you were doing – you needed to open the louvres between the shower room and living area to let just enough light in, which isn’t good if you want privacy. There wasn’t sensible closet space to store clothes – it’s a curtained off space behind the wash basin. There were no practical places to hang a towel and no place for a bathmat other than on the carpet just behind the room’s door.You also want to feel you’re welcome in a great hotel. Having to pay extra for a high-speed speed upgrade to the just-adequate Wi-Fi doesn’t say you’re welcome here. In the evening when the uber-fashionable nightclub on the rooftop takes over half of the hotel’s lifts and the hotel guests' lift lobby is reconfigured into a mirrored maze leading to an unfriendly, oversized bouncer who demands to see your room card before you can enter the lifts is even less welcoming.  For the premium price you get less than a premium experience.",Melbourne,"IntercontinentalOz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",17,2.0

Shortly thereafter, I was contacted by the manager who invited us back and offered a discount and an upgrade. We took him up on the offer during our next visit to NY, and this time, they got it right. We were put in a big, corner room with a gorgeous view of the Hudson and lower Manhattan. A bottle of prosecco was waiting for us in the room. We stayed for 5 days and didn't want to leave.

Walking through the lobby is like a maze, it could even be looked at as futuristic. But the rooms are very cozy and the views are beautiful. You see nothing but the water and the the beautiful city. We went for the Fourth of July and we didn't have to leave our room to get an amazing view of the fireworks! The staff was very pleasant, as I was a little curious as to how they would be from the prior reviews I had seen. We arrived at 9am because we wanted to see the city, and check in wasn't until 3pm, I wanted to go in and use the bathroom in the meantime but they allowed us to check in early and we're very helpful. They didn't even charge us foran early check in, so that was definitely a plus. The only complaint I do have is that there is literally no parking garages or areas designated for the hotel itself. All the parking garages are blocks away and who really wants there car that far away, sight unseen? So we were forced to use the only parking the hotel offered. The valet ofcourse which was $55 a night. But all in all the stay was amazing.

It was a great way to escape the city for a night without actually leaving town. I would recommend the hotel to visitors if they are looking to splurge on a swanky spot in a trendy neighborhood.

The room is cheap quality hipster crap. First the door lock was jammed and was hard to open. The beds are ridiculously low.

I don't take long showers. Even the body lotion sucked and I had to wipe it off with a towel. I was only staying one night working an event, so I didn't complain, but I told the front desk person at check out, whom didn't say sorry, offer any deal or really seemed to care. But, he was pretty though. As for the restaurants, I tried 2. The first one the beer garden, the place wasn't busy at that moment and the hostess made me wait for a seat for one. Once seated the two women next to me said good luck getting any service. They hadn't seen their waiter for 20 minutes. They were ready to walk out without paying. I wait then left, no one came to my table. I went to the grill, the food is great, but the service there leaves something to be desired. Everyone is pretty, but that's as deep as it goes. The rooftop lounge was cool, but the first time (7 pm) I went I couldn't get near the bar. The second time was at 5 pm and it was empty. As I approached the door to go up I was asked both times if I was staying at the hotel.

It’s a structure that invites curiosity!So this time we decided to stay here. Let me get straight to the part when you walk into your room on a beautiful late afternoon summer day, and in front of you is the famous skyline covered in a golden glow, with the Empire State building jutting out of the tetris like horizon. I was in love!What is amazing about this hotel is that every room has a view. Because it is situated on the very east of mid-town, each room either faces towards the newly topped out Freedom Tower or the Empire State building. You’re guaranteed a view.The rooms are not the largest, but they have a retro feel and are very well layed out. They’re bright, have a very large and comfortable bed, and even though I’m not a tub person, I loved the rather deep and squarish tub where two people can easily fit in.And then there is the rooftop bar on the 18th floor. Wow! 360 you are surrounded by the famous NYC skyline. It just wants to make you drink a manhattan, which you also do. Just make sure you are dressed right! No sneakers. No shorts. I actually went out and bought shoes to come here!The service is wonderful, friendly, hip and young. And as you walk out into the newly refreshed meat packing district, you feel the buzz of this great city.If you decide to workout, the gym on the 17th floor has got to have one of the best views I’ve ever seen from a gym!EXCEPT … I was inclined to take a star off my rating due to the crappy internet, which really pissed me off. Free internet should be good enough to do your emails and read news. And The Standard does not deliver on this basic premise. It jammed my laptop because all the synch-ing went awry. When I measured the speed, the download and upload was embarrassingly slow.

The front desk staff was friendly and check-in was quick and easy. The check-in for valet for dropping off my car was also quick and easy...We booked the hudson studio room to have extra space...the room had awesome views as well.That is pretty much where the good part stops...I had called ahead and requested a room on a high floor 2-3 days prior to the trip.... the staff said that it could be accommodated on the phone.When I arrived at the hotel and checked-in they stated that my room was only on the 5th floor. I asked about the request for a higher floor and the nice front desk person stated that unfortunately they were already all committed to other guests who have checked into the hudson rooms. I was surprised as the room which I paid for should have been reserved with the high floor request in advance as booked.. Regardless not a huge deal... I went to the room and even though the room was on the 5th floor the views were amazing...Friday after checking in we went to the roof top bar area around 9pm...The staff at the door was pretty rude on the 18th floor, we had no clue where to go we stated that we were hotel guests and they said ok no problem and stamped our hands. However when we did not know what door to go through to get into the roof top area they then rudely showed us.. Like we were suppose to know to push on a wall that has large that has a door in it.. Then when we got into the bar area there was about 10 other people there at the bar and 40-60 people in the club area....The bar had (no joke ) about 12 bar tenders.However after waiting for over 15 minutes myself, my girl and the other 8-10 people at the bar were confused as to why nobody would get served by one of the 12 bar tenders!The staff at the bar was all pretty rude and anytime any of use tried to ask for drinks they were all ""busy"" setting up for the club that nightI cannot understand for $18+ a drink why one of the 12 people setting up the bar for the club couldn't process drink orders.. Seems like very poor management of time/staff.Eventually everyone got drinks ( by a rude bar tender as they were upset that we all kept asking... )We then had a good time as the night went on and were able to get drinks more regularly once the staff ""setup""The staff on the roof top part of the bar as well was very snobby and rude... I was very surprised.It seemed that they were that way with most people...Saturday around 2pm we went back to the 18th floor figured we would catch some sun and grab a view drinks. To our surprise the people at the door on the 18th floor this time very rudely said that the entrance to the bar is on the street now.Like we were suppose to know that.. I said wait, we are hotel guests and last night I walked right through the door you are standing next to to get to the roof. The lady at the desk on the 18th floor extremely rudely stated again that the area is closed and we had to go back down to the street.We were also with others guests of the hotel at this time and we were all very surprised.So myself my date and 4 other hotel guests went back to the elevator and to the street. The most surprising part of it all was that when we got to the street there was a line of about 80 people trying to get to the roof of our hotel.We went to the front of the line and asked the door man hey we are all staying in the hotel, here is our room keys the lady upstairs said we had to enter from the street.The man extremely rudely stated that we had to move away from his ""area"" at the door and that we could not get upstairs unless we waited in the long line of people.I was shocked. I told the guy look I have a room upstairs at a price of over $700 a night and you are telling me I cannot get to my own hotels roof top lounge area at 2pm on a saturday. He basically again said the same thing... that nobody could get up unless they waited in the line. I was extremely upset... I have never been to a bar or hotel where the staff overall except the front desk employees all seemed so snobby and rude. I have stayed at dozens of high end hotels in nyc and over 100 hotels in the past 10+ years in other major cities and never had experienced anything like this on such a broad level of disregard for hotel guests and customers.We ended up going to the Dream Downtown roof top bar ( I stayed here a few times before ) way better than the standard highline... in every aspect. We were not hotel guests and we were allowed to go right up to the roof top bar with a packed crowd and got several drinks easily.After the dream we walked down the block and hit up my favorite spot the Gansevoort Meat Packing District hotel. (stayed here several times before as well) Again same thing.. Got on the elevator not as a hotel guest and went right to the roof. Even the rooftop bar at the dream downtown and the gansevoort is far beyond the view of the standard. The standard rooftop is very small.Gansevoorts is huge and has a pool and a much better crowd, same with dream downtown!The Gansevoort roof was packed, and even though there were only 4 bar tenders on the roof/pool area they served us all within minutes and they were all very happy to be there making money doing their job and treating customers right. I tip normally at about 30%+ when a bar tender in a major city does a good job.. They showed much appreciation... I walked up to the bar with tons of people at it throughout the rest of the night and I was immediately served and they knew what I wanted. The highline standard can learn a lot from the neighboring hotels...We ended up staying at the gansevoort roof for like 4-5 hours just drinking like crazy and having tons of fun with the other customers drinking on the roof.../pool area...Sunday called for my car then went downstairs 30 minutes later and could not find exactly where the valet person was.There was no valet attendant where we originally parked/dropped off the car.I also could not see my car anywhere on the street... I went inside asked the guys in the lobby.. They said that the valet usually parks the cars on the other side of the bar in the lobby instead of where we dropped it off...Ok no big deal, except we finally see my car and still no valet attendant.Nobody was in sight.I waited around for 10 minutes near my car and other cars and could not find any valet person at all to get my key from.Another thing that shocked me is that they had my Jaguar f type convertible parked on the street with the roof down.There were people near my car taking pictures of it and you can easily open the glove box and the other storage areas from the car with the doors locked because the roof was down. So basically anyone could have took stuff out of my car. No valet person there to watch over it!Eventually found valet attendant when he came back from I am assuming dropping off other customers cars, we got our keys and left.Only to find out that when I got home to PA I noticed that my EZ Pass was missing from my windshield.So now I drove from NYC to PA about 2 hours through several tolls with no ezpass.Someone stole the ez pass from my car ( since it was left open with no valet watching it )I cannot wait to get the bills from NY, NJ turnpike and PA with bills for going through the EZ pass without paying...I had no clue until I got home that it was missing ( noticed when I went through the last toll in pa and the light did not turn green... )All in all we had an amazing trip... I travel frequently and I had an excellent time with my significant other in NYC. However other than enjoying the hotel room we did not really have any fun at all in the hotel which is sad because when I go away and stay in a nice hotel, I normally will just spend most of my time and money in the hotel relaxing...I ended up spending thousands of dollars in other hotels which is a loss for the standard not me... I will not be back...Rocco","Miami Beach, Florida","rocco c</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami Beach, Florida</strong>",7,2.0

Lobby is cool, rooftop club is super cool, (Just because you stay in hotel does not mean you get into club and they tell you that when you check in) great food and bars in and right next to hotel. So look I am 34 years old and $450 a night hotels are more and more common especially in NYC. If I was staying at this hotel with my wife I would think it was cool and would have less issue with it. Unfortunately I stayed here with my female BFF for her birthday weekend. This hotel has NO ROOMS WITH DOUBLE BEDS... There are no roll aways either. No big deal we are close and we had a king room. The weird part is the shower and bath. There is a huge walk in shower with a bath tub that will fit 4 people right when you enter the room. Guess what it has no door and is open to the room. There are shutters that you can close to the room but there is no door you can close. We made it work but you would think they could install a fogged glass door or something. Also the Shampoo, Body Wash, and Conditioner is mounted to the wall and cannot be moved. (Seriously it requires a tool to refill them.) If you take a bath there is no way to use the bath products as they are on the other side of the massive shower. That was super annoying! Hotel has free Wifi which for a hotel at this price point is rare. All of the people that are in and hanging around the hotel are gorgeous young professionals. You for sure feel cool for staying here. Best part of the hotel was the bed linens. OMG they were the nicest I have ever experienced in my life and I am a bed linen snob.","North Las Vegas, Nevada","q45lover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",44,4.0

Well, the chic and a bunch of poseurs. It does not feel very welcoming to normal, average, people - like ME! :) There is a snooty vibe all around - I take that back. THE BELL STAFF were not snooty - they were friendly and pleasant. Everyone else (staff and guests) were snooty patooty.And yet. And yet.... I give it FOUR STARS (which is high in my book!). If the attitudes were better and it was not so spray tan fakey - I would give it 10 stars (if TripAdvisor had that option). The room was fantastic!!!! Room 617 - great view, comfy bed, good tv, fine closet, clean... But the SHOWER, the SHOWER is what puts this hotel over the top. AMAZING! Rain forest like feel to the shower head, and you can open the ""shutters"" over the soaker tub and watch NYC life happen in front of your eyes WHILE SHOWERING. Loved it. Good location - Chelsea Market right around the corner. Not far from metro. Downstairs restaurant food selection at lunch time not that great but the flat bread was good.Downsides (besides the aforementioned snootiness) - DARK. I realize it is hip to be dark and moody, but SO DARK YOU CAN'T SEE IN THE ELEVATOR to push your room button is takin' it a tad bit too far. The whole place is dark (except in my room, where I controlled the lighting :) ). Other negative is price - quite expensive.Go for the view and the shower. Pack your high heels and tightest pants, cuz without them you are going to feel out of place even in the lobby.","Arlington, Virginia","PriusGirlVA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Arlington, Virginia</strong>",183,4.0

Quite a few hotels are, these days. However, pleasantly surprised to discover that this busy, trendy hang-out also doubles as a good business hotel. The Standard is two blocks from our NY office, which is a great start, but also made a good effort at looking after hotel guests as well as they do the guys using the bars and restaurants - not always the case. Funky reception with fast, courteous and efficient staff. I was welcomed back, even though my last stay was in '08. Rooms are a tad small but shower and bath are great. Good TV, very well-stocked minibar and amazing views over the Hudson. There are some great restaurants a short distance away, notably the Old Homestead, plus an Apple Store which is open until 2200. Check-out was a dream, considering it was at 0500. I rang down at 0455 to request my bill and to reserve a cab (you cannot book Yellow Cabs), four minutes later my bill was ready, the cab to JFK outside the door and the 'damage' very reasonable. Will go back again, sooner this time!","North Chailey, United Kingdom","twa203</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>North Chailey, United Kingdom</strong>",204,4.0

It is situated in the Meatpacking District, a neighbourhood crawling with nice bars and restaurants. If you're looking for a fun weekend to party with your friends this is definitely the place to be. Are you looking for a quiet retreat for your family then you would probably be better of somewhere else.We found the rooms in The Standard to be rather small. We booked a standard king, which had a very small bathroom with a seperate claustrofobic toilet. The room also lacked sufficient storage space for your clothes. The room was clean though.The lack of roomspace did not bother us much, because the food/drink section of the hotel made up for that completely. On the ground floor there is the Grill restaurant with ample indoor & outdoor seating. Breakfast is also served there. The food is simple but really nice. Next door there's a German style Biergarten, where you should definitively try a couple of pints. Showpiece of the hotel is the Top of the Standard, a huge lounge bar on the 18th floor, with stunning views of Manhattan and the Hudson river. One floor up there is a discoteque and a roof terrace (which we did not visit). All of the above highly recommended and with great service.

And I mean really, really hip, not a pretender like me. Rooms are small but with a great view. Bar and dining arrangements are a bit confusing with various entrances, times, dress codes etc. the upstairs bar (the one without the strict dress code) is uber cool hence on a sunny Sunday like today it rather resembled a caged chicken factory for the young uber dudes. Much more preferable are the downstairs restaurants which have great food and drinks, excellent staff and a great view of the passing parade of uberatti. Would I come back?

The staff in general were quite good. Concierge actually were fun and aren't as starchy as some other hotels so thumbs up to them! As a solo I definitely recommend this hotel for other solo travelers. I loved the area, close to lots of night spots and good eats. The only fault I would say is that I had to wait to check in for over an hour as the room had not been cleaned. Although the staff were apologetic I would say that I wasn't really impressed that I had to wait especially since I'd be running around all day.

The hotel caters to casual visitors to the rooftop bars and give little recognition to hotel guests. The congestion at the lifts of a weekend is a nightmare. There is no priority or reserved lift for hotel guests.2. The wifi in rooms drops in and out and to get a constant signal you need to sit in the hallway.3. The TV streaming signal also drops out mid show and often does not return.4. The maids don't replace the soap even when you have to leave a note requesting more.5. Unlike other hotels there are no umbrellas kept at the front desk for guests. If the one in your room is broken, as was ours, there are no others.6. The wardrobe is so small that none of our international bags will fit in it opened or closed.The hotel is very popular but the focus is not on hotel guests.

We found our room to be acceptable (all be it small with a strange shower layout that for those with mobility issues would present a major issue) as were the dinning options which is good. Now for the problems during the course of a less than 24 hour stay we got stuck on various floors of the hotel for more than fifteen minutes each time with elevator issues. In two cases my wife and I walked down six flights of stairs exiting the building through a service entrance just to leave. Upon notice the hotel seemed unphased at the on going elevator issues and made little attempt to explain or make the issue right. A hotel of this cost must find a way to better communicate and handle there maintenance issues. We won't be back! ,,Kyle H,1,2.0
