I usually stay at the larger resorts when in HNL, but since this was a short 3 night trip we decided to stay here to save some money. I probably wouldn’t stay here again because it lacked amenities, but overall it was a nice stay for the price. What I liked: - Great location (right across the street from the Duke’s statue).- Staff was very friendly and accommodating when we asked for a late checkout. - Beds were comfortable- Balcony with ocean front view was amazing!- Concierge service (although they didn’t help very much)What I didn’t like:- Bathroom and shower were REALLY small! - lots of outside noise - garbage trucks, leaf blowers in the morning (sliding glass door is old and not double paned).

Rooms are small but that is okay. Very clean, especially considering all the sand that must get tracked in to every room, very friendly staff, great location. For some reason, there is always a huge line up at Eggs 'n Things, so even though being a guest at the hotel entitles you to a 10% discount, we just never took advantage of it because we didn't want to spend all that time in line.Beds were very comfortable, shower was small but adequate. It was nice to have a newspaper every morning. The location is phenomenal - right across the street from the beach!

However, I got a descent package deal by staying at Ashton Waikiki Circle.The hotel is small and one of the older ones in Waikiki, which it definitely shows in the hall ways, etc. The rooms are small and the bathroom even smaller. It's good enough for up to two adults, but anything more you will be bumping hips. Every room has a refrigerator but no microwave. There are no iron or ironing boards in the room. You can request one and they will bring it to your room.The plus side, every room has a beach view. Even a partial view is nice, as seen in my pic.Yes, the rooms are small, but the location is great! Waikiki beach is directly across the street, Mcdonalds is next door, famous eggs and things is downstairs. So many shopping and eating options all within walking distance.On a side note, if you plan on renting a car, the hotel only has 22 parking spaces available which is on a first come first serve basis. They assign you a remote that lets you in their garage. If you are lucky to get one of the 22 remotes, then you hold it during your whole stay, which means you have a parking stop your whole visit.Parking is $29 a day which they charge you upon check out.However, if you are not lucky enough to claim one of those 22 spots on your visit, they told me that they have an overflow parking lot 3 blocks away, and the price each day is $10 less.The hotel also charges a resort fee each night. I think it is $25 a night. This fee is ridiculous. The hotel has no exercise room, no pool, no free breakfast,no laundry service, no valet, etc.They will talk it up, that the resort fee includes wi fi, towels to use for the beach, and free dvd movie rentals.Oh, it can be very noisy. I stayed at the top floor (level 14 which is the highest)and the noise level can be high from the street noise. Cars, emergency vehicles, people talking, yelling.There are other bigger hotels as your neighbors, so depending on what side you are on hotel, you can literally yell out to them or see in their rooms. Visa versa.The hotel really doesnt have a lobby either.You kind of walk up to a person behind glass windows to check in/out.Overall it is not bad. Can't beat the location and convenience of everything.Yes, rooms are small, but you're in Hawaii...you should only be in your room to sleep. Enjoy Hawaii!","Woodbridge, Virginia","Ade R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woodbridge, Virginia</strong>",11,4.0

I have been to many hotels and this is the first time I had bug bites from a hotel. I only stayed in this hotel for one night and all those bug bites scars leave on my leg forever!!.

One day we bought two six pack of beers, bread and ham to make some sandwiches. That same night we drank 10 beers. Next day, September 18th, we all went to hang out and travel around Oahu, when we got back we noticed that the two remaining beers, a bottle of water and a bread were missing.We didn't want to report because we were afraid that if the same person knew that we had reported her she would steal us even more.

Our room was kept very clean. The housekeeping staff are fabulous ladies, and John at the front desk really did all he could to make our stay wonderful, helping us switch to a higher floor once a room became available. The hotel also gives you access to beach towels, beach toys, floaties, and body boards (when available) which we really appreciated. They had two elevators which were very fast.

It is across the street from the beach, without any hotel in the way on the beach side, like some of the places further west on Kalakaua St. It is centrally located so you're in easy walking distance of Queen Kapiolani park (where the zoo and aquarium are) and also the shopping at the west end of Kalakaua if that's your thing. Also, if you take tours or go to the Polynesian Cultural Center, a lot of the tour busses pick up behind the Hyatt Regency, which is only a block away. The hotel is older but the rooms are clean and were fine for me and my wife. We were offered an upgrade to a full beach view for cheap, which we recommend - it's nice to be able to see the ocean from your balcony. The AC works well, as does the wifi - we've been to many hotels where the wifi is terrible, not here. We had several phones, laptops, and tablets connected and never had an issue. There are a lot of electrical outlets on the walls and electrical outlets on the lamps, so we were able to keep everything charged. Complementary coffee (and tea) is nice and plentiful, including half-and-half. We used the refrigerator and hotel safe, no issues. Also, the restaurant at the bottom of the hotel, Eggs N' Things, is pretty good for breakfast, and is nice and close. They seem to have a line every morning, so get there early. The only minor issues we had at the hotel is that the TV seemed a little unstable - it seemed like we would often get a ""No Signal"" indication after watching a channel for a bit. The good wifi made the TV issue less important, and we weren't looking to watch a lot of TV while on vacation. Also, the water pressure in the shower isn't great, but good enough to get the job done. The showers are quite small, and I suspect the water pressure is purposely kept lower so that you don't flood the bathroom. We told the front desk about the water pressure and they sent someone, but it didn't change. A little higher water pressure and better TV would have made this room about perfect, for us at least. But other than those 2 things, we really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay again.

There was construction going on at a hotel next door, but who goes to Hawaii to hang out in a hotel room? It was very easy to get Ubers, and catch tours at the Hyatt Regency next door. There is a popular restaurant at the ground level - Eggs N Things that offers takeout if you prefer to grab and go.

Hotel noise: The hotel is circular, so the hallways are circular and there is no carpet. When someone closes the dooor to their room, it slams and echoes. Rooms are not sound proof. Final notes: This hotel is sandwiched between an ABC Store (the best convenience store in Hawaii) and McDonald's. A breakfast restaurant that serves all day is on the property. Starbucks is 2 blocks away. The room had a mini fridge that was actually cold. Keurig coffee maker to get your day going.In Hawaii, I want a view of the ocean from my room and a clean place to shower and rest my head after playing in the sun all day. This hotel fits the bill.","Seattle, Washington","bailarina5678</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",74,3.0

We have a family of 6 - Mum, Dad, 16, 14, 11 and 8. Due to room sizes and restrictions, we booked two rooms billed as family rooms - 2 adults, 2 children. As the photos show, both rooms had only double beds - no singles or fold outs. Mum and daughters (16, 11) shared one room, Dad and sons (14, 8) shared the other. Due to the ages of our kids, this worked okay for us. Room had a fridge and coffee machine, as well as a PS3 connected to the television to act as a DVD player. We had rooms on the left side, 3rd floor where construction work was underway on a neighbouring building. Not the fault of the hotel - we weren’t really disturbed by any noise and we just closed the curtains from the workmen. Additionally, we didn’t really have a lot of traffic noise around our side of the building nor were there any noises from the hallway.Very central in Waikiki, walked to all locations, including Honolulu (a full day out walking) and around Diamond Head (Another full day out walking). The MacDonalds at the base of the hotel was good for breakfasts and quick meals. We didn’t go to the other breakfast store on the other side. Would suggest getting groceries from the Food Pantry about 10 minutes walk away, the ABC stores were a little more expensive. All in all we felt very secure at the hotel, the keycard system controlled access to the lifts as well as the rooms which was a good feature.The hotel itself felt a little dated and the rooms were fairly compact - the bathroom also was a tight fit for two people, but it was certainly adequate for our needs to have a base from which to explore the surrounds. We had some problems with the PS3, but a trip down to the reception booth and they were very happy to assist by sending someone up to help out.

Our Uber driver wasn't familiar with the hotel and mapping to it showed a different name so there was some confusion if we were at the right place. We knew enough to look for a circular building. The front desk staff- HELPFUL and SOOO Nice. They were able to accommodate us for an early check in and managed to get us 2 rooms side by side. The rooms are arrayed in a circle on each floor and thus each room is almost like a slice of pie. They were decorated in bright colors and kept very clean. As a result of the shape of the room- there are some idiosyncrasies that must be managed. The room is small but used every square inch available. Bathroom was small. But this is Hawaii - you shouldn't pay high prices for a room that you should only sleep in is my thought. Where this hotel shines is it's fabulous location and proximity to Waikiki beach- literally- walk across the street. You can't get any better than that at the rate we snagged for our room.

From the moment I checked in to my reluctant departure, this hotel really was perfect for my short trip.I was welcomed by ""The Goddess,"" Naomi, who got me settled in my room, 1403. The hotel is in a round building just across Kalakaua Avenue from the beach. The rooms are uniquely shaped. Mine had two double beds. There is a small desk area, a safe, a refrigerator and a coffee maker. The TV is plenty big. There is also a playstation 3 and you can use this to watch movies and games available for free rental downstairs. (I didn't use this...) The bathroom is smaller and there is a amaller shower without a bath. Toiletries are Hawaiian Tropic and the shampoo smells like coconut!And then there is the balcony. This is where I spent a great deal of my ""in room"" time just staring at the ocean and the sunset, enjoying my coffee. It's just wonderful. (See pictures.) On site parking under the hotel with ""in-and-out"" privileges was just under thirty dollars nightly. There is a resort fee (but every hotel has a resort fee). Wi-Fi (fast and reliable) is included in the resort fee. A key is required for the elevator so I felt secure and hotel staff is present 24-7. I had a late flight and, for an extra charge, after normal check-out I moved to a room (208) with a 10PM check out. Very convenient for a shower and a nap before my red-eye to the mainland. 10% discount at ""Eggs-N-Things"" which is right downstairs. Great views and service. Okay food. Review to follow.The hotel staff is so welcoming and kind. I can't say enough positive about them. They can answer any question you may have.This was among the cleanest hotel rooms I have stayed.With respect to location, this hotel is in the Center of Waikiki at Kuhio Beach and walking distance to everything. Bottom line: I'll return to the Aston Waikiki Circle!Pro Tips: 1. Spring for the oceanfront room. 2. The free Kuhio Beach Hula Show is right across the street at the big banyan tree stage on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays. Google it!3. Waikiki is a city beach. It's beautiful but it's not a quiet tropical getaway; there are other destinations for that.4. Enjoy this wonderful and unique place and respect its rich history, tradition and culture.

But, it is cheap and cheerful and does have a downside. The hotel is an oddly designed concrete structure that is in need of refurbishment and can be quite noisy. Doors to the rooms do not fit properly and there is a good 10mm gap under the door and a 3-4mm gap around, (at night you will readily see light from the corridor penetrate around the door frame), this means that any noise from the corridor, which is not carpeted, comes straight through the door. Also the sliding doors to the balcony in both my room and my friend’s room could not be closed properly which meant that the noise from the street outside was also a problem. My friend had a standard room at the rear of the hotel. However, the hotel that is just to the rear of the Aston Waikiki Circle has a large 4th floor sundeck with pool, there also bars and BBQ areas; this generated a lot of noise in the evening.We both slept as best as we could with earplugs.As other reviewers have mentioned, the rooms are smaller than they appear in the photos. Although they are getting old they are clean and well serviced daily by the friendly staff. The hotel lobby will provide beach towels and the beach is literally 50m away across the road.There is limited parking in the hotel basement at $28/day (2018 price) and when we parked the car there were always spaces available.","New Milton, United Kingdom","Gaylee61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Milton, United Kingdom</strong>",17,2.0

John was very helpful in pointing out that my booking was for a standard room but for an extra $30 per night i could have a beach view room. I paid the the extra and was very happy with the 10th floor view. The room was on the small side but was air conditioned and had an ensuite. There was also a coffee maker, TV and DVD player that were included under your daily service charge. All hotels in Hawaii charge a daily service charge in addition to your room charge. The room was clean and tidy. The road between the hotel and the beach has a lot of one way traffic. You can get the occasional late night motorcycle, drag car or police siren going past.

The hotel was in a prime location in Waikiki but more of a tower of rooms rather than a hotel really! The reception is a hut in the lobby area (between Eggs and Things and the lift to the bedrooms). The staff here do the job but are not particularly friendly or welcoming. Having said that, one member of staff did sort out a car parking place for me at the hotel, after the first day we had to leave our hire car four blocks away in another hotel, but other than him, they were all fairly surly! Our room (I stayed with one of my daughters) was comfortable (we each had a small double bed), with a good shower in the non-bath room! The housekeeping staff kept our room in good order, with clean towels daily and beds made (although not changed during our stay, as far as I was aware). There is a resort charge of $26 a day, which covered our use of Wifi, a coffee machine in the room, a paper, use of a room safe, use of DVDs (which we used extensively) etc. However, given this is the rate for most hotels, it seemed excessive for the services we actually received at this budget hotel (and added $260 to our final bill!). There were some minor issues, for example, the refrigerator in our room was extremely smelly. We did try and keep a few things in this but they ended up smelling too - so we couldn't store the products in this, we would have liked too i.e. we would have liked to have had some breakfast items (my daughter is vegan, so found it really difficult to cater for her needs, with few restaurants having vegan options) but the state of the fridge made this impossible. If we had had a baby with us and needed to store their food/milk, this fridge would have needed to have been changed - it was awful! The is also construction work going on next door i.e. it appears either another budget style hotel is being built OR apartments, and this commences at 6am in the morning.

There is even an equally small but VERY popular restaurant on the premises (10% discount), and an ABC convenience store next door (you will pay for the convenience). The bathroom, and rooms them-self are very small, with 2 beds, with an OLD looking carpet and bathroom fixtures, not to mention a dingy/slightly grimy tiled shower floor that needs a good scrubbing/cleaning/tile restoration. It’s as if the ENTIRE hotel is stuck in a time warp from the 70s! Meanwhile... a complete renovation of a same sized hotel is going on right next door (get with the program Aston Circle!!!). It’s s good thing that one doesn’t really go to beautiful Hawaii to spend all that much time in the room. YOLO... true... and it is Hawaii, so remember to bring LOADS of money for excursions, to eat, and to buy such little things that we take for granted on the mainland (e.g., water $5 for a 6-pack; $2.50 for a chocolate bar; and inflated prices for what we’d consider cheap staple foods... McD’s, Subway, BK, and Kentucky to name a few. If you find the staple restaurant prices to be expensive, then you’ll really get sticker shock when it comes to restaurants you’d typically visit to eat dinner at... PF Chang’s, Hardrock Cafe, Tony Romas)! Take your own favorite snacks and pack water in your checked luggage if you have space/weight limits available. Flip flops, a good pair of sneakers, shorts, t-shirts, and sundresses are the only attire that one needs (and perhaps a poncho...pick one up from Dollar Tree or Family Dollar before you go, because you’ll not find those stores there!)!","Miami, Florida","NoraNeil</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",1,3.0

It drives my kids crazy . They say just once they'd like to go to a gas station I haven't yelped or studied on TripAdvisor . And they are not exaggerating . My debate was this : did I want to stay in one of the nice resorts with a nice pool and settle for a city view room because I didn't want to pay the big price for the ocean view or did I want to stay at this Aston Waikiki circle and give up having a pool and a fancy resort to have an ocean front view . I chose the circle , and although I have a couple complaints , I am happy with my decision . To be able to wake up and walk on to your balcony and watch surfers under the rainbows , that's why you stay here . Now , one of my complaints is a big one that you should know if you are booking this hotel for the ocean front view . CONSTRUCTION ! NOISY ALL DAY , CRANE LIFTING BRICKS , JACK HAMMERING ALL DAY ! we stayed in an ocean front room on the 13 th floor which was directly across from the construction . At first I was upset and tried moving rooms but they didn't have anything else . I was a little upset that there was no warning by the hotel letting us know this would be going on . The construction is not on this hotel and not their fault but there should have been a warning or a discount . If you can get one of the ocean front rooms that is straight facing the ocean or facing towards diamond head that would be much better . It's not directly across from the construction so I imagine a little less noise . You want a room that ends in 4 or 5 if in an ocean front room . Ours was 1306. Although the construction was an annoyance it did not ruin our time and I would choose this hotel again . It is that worth it to have that view and the proximity to the ocean and to many food places . There is an abc store to your left and to your right . These stores are literally on every corner . They have everything from toiletries to souvenirs . We are at eggs and things downstairs twice . Don't let the long line scare you away , you get a menu while in line , order when you get to front of line so when seated your food is on it's way in a few minutes and worth it . You get 10% off if staying at the circle . We walked to dukes steakhouse and Cheesecake Factory a couple of times , about 5-7 minute walk. We even walked to ala Mona center one night to eat at bubba gump shrimp . It took us about 25 minutes to walk it and we took the pink trolley back . There is no fancy lobby . When the elevator door opens you are looking st the beach which we thought was a cool feeling . The front desk gives you beach towels and there are floaties , chairs and boogie boards for your use . You just grab what you want but get it early because they get taken up . The room was small . It was just me and my daughter so it was fine. The shower would be another minor complaint . It's small which I could deal with but to not get the water to go all over the floor took some skill. The shower head faces you as your trying to turn it on and you have to open the curtain to turn it on so ..... make sure you put a towel on the floor when starting it . The beds were not the best but not the worst . The pillows were flatter than I prefer but you get 3 per bed . Don't rent a car the whole time you are there , why pay over $20 a night to park when there is a hertz rental car next door at the Hyatt open from I believe 8 a.m and doesn't close until 9 p.m. We rented from there twice for one day rentals it takes three minutes to walk over there . If I ever go back to Waikiki I will stay here again hoping for no construction . I suggest calling the hotel and asking for a room facing away from construction .

To call this a resort fee is a joke. No swimming pool but Waikiki beach is right across the street. WiFi is included in rate. There is a highly popular breakfast place attached to the hotel which provides a 10 percent discount for hotel guests. However, lines are very long to get in there. The hotel also offers parking underneath the building for a fee. However, parking is limited. I think they have 22 spots so if you plan to rent a car and use their parking, I would call ahead and see if you can reserve in advance. Several times while I was there, it was listed as full at the lobby. Staff is friendly and helpful and I think it’s generally good value for money but keep in mind it is an aging property.

The place is old and definitely needs a make over. This is not a hotel in my opinion, just serviced rooms. There is no reception, only a window ""hatch"" behind which someone sits.The rooms are very small and fitting in two beds makes this worse (especially if you only need the one, however each bed is anyway only a small double). The bathroom is minute. Water is very hot (beware) but only one person can fit in the bathroom at any one time. Full frontal room is a lovely position and with excellent views over the ocean (and the unfortunate homeless people camped outside). The Circle has a popular restaurant at the front (Eggs n' Things). Unfortunately the cooking smell comes up into the rooms. When you sit on the balcony, the air conditioning unit spits water over you if switched on!The few staff we saw (in the hatch) were pleasant enough but you do not feel that you are in the sort of hotel you would expect for the price they are charging.Parking is $22 per day (a bit cheaper than others) BUT you can only book it the morning of your first day before 7.00am. Not very helpful if you arrive in the evening!No swimming pool for kids, but beach is across the road.The most outrageous thing is the $25 Resort Fee! For this you ""receive"" free WiFi, free DVD hire and an (old) coffee machine in your room. (Coffee was ghastly and tea undrinkable). I understand that the Hawaii Tourist Board are hoping to persuade the Hawaii Government to pass a law banning such ""rip off"" practices. Until then I would suggest you look at the Tourist Board's list of hotels that do not make such charges. It has quite put us off going back again to Hawaii. It is an expensive place to visit at the best of times but the hoteliers in Hawaii are destroying the Aloha and we certainly won't return again until the Hoteliers make me feel that they really want me to come there, not just my wallet and they start providing better value for money.","Vancouver, Canada","Onbusiness1234</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",52,2.0

The view, which they call euphemistically city view is to see blocks of apartments that prevent you from seeing anything more pleasant.During those days there were really strong gusts of wind but the sensation was that the wind literally entered the room. The noise from the bay window that overlooks the terrace was chilling.The coffee maker did not work since all the water went out.All in all, what really happened when I went to do the checkout was the most impressive.They, despite Booking.com proudly proclaim that it pays to checkout, the reality is that they retain the money from the first time you make the reservation .. However, when I went to pay I found that the Invoice that should have been 400 USD amounted to 687.97 USD.In addition to the fees, it is true that in small print and far from where they advertise the total amount to be charged is announced and that I could not see because it is set with the intention of going unnoticed, or worse is that they charge 25 USD more fees for the use of Wi-Fi, something absolutely unusual in these times.To make matters worse, the stay of the last night, without further notice, they raised it up to 233.11 USD that same, with taxes includedThe answer was before a crazy size that the price was fluctuating in function of the occupation that they have. I had never heard such a barbarity in any of the 120 countries previously visited.It must be said that they charge USD23.04 with the uncluded rates for parking the car in the parking lot. That is to say 256.15 USD the total amount of that night.Those prices for a hotel built in the 60s and without any apparent major renovation is outrageous and in no way corresponds to the quality offered.The employee who took care of me on the day of the checkout, that is to say on January 20 in the morning, around 10:00 o'clock the voice continually went up to explain what obviously has no explanation.From here I want to express outright my refusal to the performance of that hotel and the behavior of the employee who used a tone of voice more like a police station than a reception of a hotel where they charge 256.15 USD for sleeping one night. .Of course, they do not include breakfast. They offer a discount in an adjoining cafeteria where breakfast is not available for less than 30 USD.When I finally told the employee that I was going to make a comment on Tripadvsor, she invited me jokingly and with laughter to do so.I mean, he did not care at all",Malaga,"Espanol15</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Malaga</strong>",8,1.0

Major construction next to this hotel. Expect to first hear the prep work at 5am which includes clean up and the trucks going backwards with that safety beeping sound. We requested a quiet location so they put us in full view of the construction side. Partial cleanup starts 5am with garbage trucks with beeping backup sounds and some banging. Full construction starts 7am. The sliding glass door no longer has any insulation and rattles with the wind. I had to use newspapers to act as insulation when the sliding glass door does not fully close. On windy days the corridor of inside of hotel sounds like ur in a tent. The hotel is drafted to the outside like a motel. People rated this hotel high since is right on the beach. However the hotel has poor sound insulation. Forget sleeping in here. I hope you are an early riser. No resting at all form 5am to 7pm daily. In addition the doors are all metal. If someone closes there door it's like a slam. Shame on Aston for not telling quests about the construction. For the price of one day of the 25 amenity fee they could insulate one room.In addition the shower needs anti scalding. If you turn the handle to get hotter it just gets a bit warmer. Then it gets super scalding hot. The trick is to turn it all the way hot then lower it. Try not to burn your hand doing this.

Choosing a hotel on Waikiki Beach from afar isn't easy, but dwarfed by all Lego brick like hotels towering over a relatively overcrowded small beach, we found a quaint round hotel, ""The Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel,"" overlooking the beach.We booked a room with ""Ocean View,"" and well, there was a view of the beach and ocean, but the noisy construction of a neighbouring high rise building had certainly limited the view, meaning that it ought to be re-classified as a room with a partial ocean view. A suggestion that wasn't well received.To be sure of having an unobstructed view, book an ocean front view room.Apart from that the room was actually quite nice with a pleasant colour scheme.At the entrance one finds ""Eggs 'n Things."" Each morning with a long line of people outside waiting to be seated, but only a short walk away we found a ""Cheeseburgers in Paradise"" which can be recommended for breakfast. Looking at massive buildings surrounding ""The Waikiki Circle"" one wonders when it will be replaced by a new Lego brick hotel.",Aarhus,"Via2r</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aarhus</strong>",41,3.0

This does NOT include the $20/day amenity fee and $22 for parking. Checking in: If you have a car, pull up onto the left ramp to check in first. Then they will give you a ticket to put on your dash and a remote for the underground parking. There is limited parking and if you don't get one, there is a sister hotel you can park at down the street.During my stay here, there was a filming production at Eggs N Things so we couldn't use our 10% off coupon. They hand out beach towels for free and you're welcome to use the inner tubes and boogie boards free of charge.Room: We had the partial ocean view room. The view was beautiful however the room is a bit dated. We were placed in a handicap room. Upon entering, there was a strong smell of cleaning products. I had to leave the sliding glass door wide open for a couple hours to air out the room. It's a bit dark - I feel they could use some brighter lights in the room There's a safe, mini fridge and shampoo and lotion.Bed was a little to soft for our liking. Air conditioning is a little old so it's loud but it does the job. Overall, this is an okay hotel. I would think with the price and the added $20 amenity fee, there would be a hot tub or swimming pool.

Evidently this restaurant is quite famous. About the hotel itself. It is probably one of the oldest, smallest hotels on Wakiki beach. But it has been renovated and is immaculately clean. This is a no frills hotel, but it is also the most reasonably priced hotel on Wakiki. The shower is tiny, but clean. Our room was small, but manageable and well worth the view every day! The mattresses were a bit too soft for my taste, but that is really my only complaint. There is no pool, cable tv or laundry. But you can use the smart flat screen tv to cast shows and they have a DVD rental by the elevator. Who spends much time watching tv on Wakiki beach anyway?We stayed seven nights.

The room was on the 13th level which we had a bit of a laugh about (no number 13 bad luck for us on the holiday) moving on, the room was an adequate size for a couple and maybe a young family the view was to die for all the rooms I believe have been refurbished which give the a nice fresh feel with a nice decor selection if I was to have any negativity it would shower size but in saying that I am 183 cm tall and 110 kg's so for the average size person they will be fine.

Hopefully, you won't be spending a long time in the room anyway with so much to see and do.The only suggestions we can make for what was a very pleasant stay are for management to consider having microwaves in each room so guests can cut down prices in an expensive town and cook for themselves, and perhaps for a dimmer hallway light overnight as light streams through the cracks in the door at night.All things considered, we loved our stay and will definitely be back!","Melbourne, Australia","CandPMcD</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",68,5.0

Yes, the room may be smaller, but THE VIEW THOUGH. There is absolutely NOTHING obstructing your view when you have the oceanfront room on a high floor. You can watch the sunrise and sunset and let the ocean therapy vibe take you in. And when you feel like taking a dip in the ocean at any time during the day, all you have to do is walk across the street. The location is very convenient, the ABC store is right next to the hotel where you can get water, food, snacks, all the necessities. To me this place beats any other place I've stayed at in Maui, especially for the low price- you can get the best oceanfront room that's at half of what it would cost on Maui Kaanapali area. You can pretty much walk anywhere from this location...it's right in the middle of the Waikiki strip so not far away from anything. I've stayed at other places on Waikiki and this place is still my favorite. I've found Hyatt Place to be too far from the action/beach access and Park Shore to be also too far from convenient food places.

If you can - book ocean front. Views are stunning and whilst we were not in our room much it was so wonderful to relax and take in the view in the morning and evening before heading out again. Yes, bathroom small however we had been on the cruise of the islands so used to it and really you are just showering! Plenty of space to put things with the suitcases under the bed. Beds were comfy and whilst the air con was on the loud side it worked and also kept the street noise to a minimum for night sleeping - kinda like white noise so didn't bother us at all. All staff without exception were welcoming and helpful and room was always made up and nice to return to at the end of long hot days. Perfect position being across the road from lovely beaches and a short walk up the quieter end of town with zoo and parks and trees. We stayed for six nights. Our first two nights before the cruise was in a more spacious place but a ten minute walk to the beach - would take the circle over that in an instant. Yes - there is construction on both sides but as we were up and about most mornings except two it really didn't bother us. Having said that stay on the middle or left side facing the beach as it is the furthest from the work. Internet was fine for our purposes and worked well.

The air conditioner was ancient and loud. The housekeeping service was sporadic, either trying to come in at 8am or not making up the room at all! It is very noisy too, with not one but two construction sites, one on each side of the hotel. This was not disclosed at the time of booking and the construction was obviously well established. The actual hotel is located behind an Eggs and More Restaurant which always had a long line up, meaning not only did we never get to have a meal there but we had to walk up the steep driveway, pulling our heavy cases after 28 hours of travel, as the other entrance was filled with a queue for the restaurant. The check in area is actually outdoors, no smart hotel lobby here! There are no restaurant facilities, no pool, no bar, no kettle in the room (although there was a one cup coffee pod machine, but with paper cups!). On the positive side, the staff were polite and helpful, there is a reasonably informative tours desk, instead of a concierge, and it is right opposite the beach.

For those renting surf boards KOA Boards (whom we rented from) and another couple of surf rental shops are all only 200 or so metres away in the street behind the main strip and so very convenient. We booked an Ocean Front room and the view was great. Spend the little extra to get the Ocean Front rooms if you can. You will appreciate the views. Your overall hotel cost savings by comparison to neighbouring hotels will still leave you in front. No swimming pool or conventional hotel amenities. Really basic hotel and in that regard you get what you pay for. It was, however, clean and convenient and the hotel staff were friendly and helpful.

Both my Mother and I loved its location, all you need to do is cross a two-lane street to be on the beach. You are also within close proximity of tons of shopping, restaurants, and other hotels on Waikiki Beach.The hotel does not have a conventional-type lobby, and check-in is on street level, literally. Our check-in was expeditious, and they even gifted us a box of chocolate-covered macadamias.Our room was pretty small, but functional. Both the room and bathroom were very clean. Our balcony provided views of the ocean and was a delight. The air-conditioning kept the room crisply cold. While this hotel is not the lap of luxury, it functionally delivers everything you need for comfort, even offering a free movie rental service, which we ended up not using. Our room had a safe, which is essential, especially when you are at a beach. There was also a coffee/tea maker in the room. Beach towels are easily available from the reception desk, we were also provided with complimentary beach chairs, which you have to carry to the beach yourself. Check-out was prompt, and they called a taxi to take us to the airport. You were able to get by without a rental car, given the hotel's central location in Honolulu. You might need to rent a car, though, if you intend on exploring Oahu beyond Honolulu.I was happy with this hotel selection, would stay here again, and am happy to recommend it to others.","Los Angeles, California","JasmineMarti</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",202,5.0

There are no in room facilities to warm these up (I had a bottle warmer but it was a pain)- Balconys seem a bit dodge and it is incredibly windy on them.- Walls are paper thin.

My husband and I stayed in the Aston Circle Hotel for 4 nights in May. This is a perfect little affordable hotel for those that want to be right across the street from the beach. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Waikiki, with everything at your fingertips. The beach is literally across the street; in less than 5 mins you can be in the beautiful water. There are so many restaurants within walking distance. The very popular Eggs N Things is downstairs, be prepared to wait online even at 7am. McDonalds is right next door if you wanted to opt for a more economical brekkie. There is an ABC store right next to the hotel (I am now addicted to this store). The hotel itself is a fairly basic hotel, but has all that you need. The staff was extremely welcoming and friendly (John and Naomi aka The Goddess). There are no facilities such as a pool or restaurant but who needs a pool when the ocean is right there. You can avail of beach equipment such as boogie boards, snorkels and chairs. I would advise taking them when you see them and not wait as they go very quickly. We took 2 boogie boards the night before we drove up to the North Shore for the day. They said just make sure you bring them back. The hotel offers beach towels also, and you can just drop them in a basket at the end of the day and get clean ones the next day. I had initially booked an ocean view room as it was what my budget would allow, the view was beautiful facing Diamond Head. On the second day we asked if there were any ocean front rooms available, there was so we upgraded for the final 2 days for $30 a day. I think we could have gotten it for a little cheaper had we asked. Room 1105 was dead center with the most amazing view. While ocean view is quiet sufficient, if you can afford it I would pick oceanfront (all depends on how much it means to you though, for us it meant a lot). The rooms are basic but nice, has a coffee maker, fridge and a gaming system (cannot remember what it was). A lovely touch is getting a free newspaper at your door every morning. We rented a car for 2 days (which I would recommend to be able to explore the rest of the island). There is parking underneath the hotel which costs $22 a day, the parking lot has limited spaces so make sure you check with the hotel as soon as you get the car. You will be guaranteed a spot for as long as you need it (they give you a little key fob). There is literally no parking in Waikiki, so this is pretty much the best option. The hotel is circular which is really neat and different. I would recommend this hotel if you don't need all the frills a fancy hotel has to offer. I would definitely stay here again.","Yonkers, New York","SandraS808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yonkers, New York</strong>",15,5.0

In every way, u can't beat the views just amazing and it's actually a little closer to the beach(because of the way the beach curves around) than others nearby.  Two queens which is fine we r using one as a 2nd closet and tv watching area, flat screen tv, PlayStation, free DVD rentals, 10% off egg n things downstairs. There is a small fridge, decent closet , neat and actually decent bathroom with shower I thought it would be smaller. Clean very clean and every1 here is super nice. We checked in at noon with no line and took all of 45 seconds.  Again this place by FAR is the best deal in town, they will beat any other advertised price online.  Seriously we stayed at the Marriott Waikiki two years ago, paid double and it wasn't half the coolness of this place.  I will attach some pics of the views, are u kidding me, now if u drive a Bentley u prob won't like this place, no pool(uhh the pacific is actually 20 yards across street) no bell hops or event coordinators. But for the other 98% of the world this rocks!!!!! No complaints and if there were I would tell ya!

It is walking distance to may local restaurants, the zoo and local shopping. The bus stop is directly across the road so access to most areas is easily obtained.The rooms were small, but extremely clean and the bed/pillows enabled a great sleep (something some more modern hotels still cannot provide).Breakfast is available just outside the front door at Eggs & Things and is good value (discount for hotel patrons).We also found the staff to be excellent.

The partial-ocean view from our balcony (which was on the side of the building) more than made up for the lack of space in the room, as did the fact that the hotel was across the road from Kuhio Beach – the perfect place for kids to swim. My kids enjoyed the 'free' PlayStation 3 in the room (not really free, as you have to pay a daily resort fee for the privilege), and the WiFi signal was very strong.

From our balcony on the 7th floor, we were able to see right onto the street, with the beach as backdrop - watching the breakers roll in and surfers out there waiting for a wave in the stunning aqua blue waters of the Pacific Ocean.There were yachts, canoes and sail boats..and on consecutive mornings a cruise ship, making her slow and majestic journey to other shores. What an incredible view her passengers had.Our room, although small, had 2 double beds with aqua spreads and matching bolster cushions, fish prints on the wall and waves on the carpet.

This was one of the cheaper options we found as we wanted to stay right on the beach and not pay a fortune. You will be at the beach in under a minute…and I’d say it’s the ‘heart’ of the beach. When we arrived to the lobby (which is outdoors and not a typical lobby…it’s just a desk) they offered us an ocean view upgrade for $20/night which is completely worth it. If you book partial ocean view, it’s literally a bit of the water and more buildings than anything! They even gave us the option to get a room with one King vs. 2 doubles (but not ocean view) - apparently they have those available in small amounts - They were very friendly and accommodating and let us pick whichever option we preferred.Rooms are tiny and bathrooms (especially the showers) are also tiny but didn’t bother us at all. You’re in Hawaii! You’re rarely in the room anyways. Restaurants in the area:- Eggs and things attached to the hotel (show your room card and get 10% discount) – lines start at 6:00am when they open so allow some time for that. We were lined up for about 25minutes but didn’t bother us - McDonald’s is right beside the hotel if you need a quick bite- Steak Shack – GO HERE! It’s about a 10minute walk down the beach near the Sheraton Waikiki I believe…so yummy! Wish we ate there more- Cheesecake Factory and PF Chang’s also a walking distance - Buho Concina Cantina – great rooftop Mexican restaurant walking distance as well. Tuesdays are $2 tacos – great foodOther things to do in the area if you have a car: - Pearl Harbour & Aloha Swap meet (local flea market - $1 per person)- Ko Olina beach which is where the Disney Resort is – calm water here in 4 different lagoons…we wanted a change from the business of Waikiki - free- Diamond Head Hike - $5 for parking or $1 per person if you get there by foot","Kitchener, Canada","skrsToronto</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kitchener, Canada</strong>",95,5.0

We had 2 double beds. Daughters sharing a bed. Yes room small but we knew that from reading reviews. Wasn't much room left with our 4 bags left on floor. But didn't worry us as only time in our room was sleeping and usually an hour or so before sleep. We sat or laid on our beds watching the TV or on iPads/phones. Small fridge was handy. Bathroom was very good.Daughter complained about noise of Air con when start up and shut off. But I fixed that by changing from energy save to constant mode. We went for a budget room with out a view as we rather spend our money on trips. Especially considering how little time we spent in our room. We got a great deal. Location is the key with this hotel. It is over the road from the best part of Waikiki beach. You have a choice of the rock pool or the open beach. Surfboard and SUPs hire is over the road too. No pool at hotel but with the beach over the road is all you need. Downstairs in lobby is Eggs and Things a very popular place especially for breakfast. It's a great breakfast but can be a wait. Check reviews on it. Also handy on one side of hotel is a large ABC store great to grab a drink or a sandwich when leaving in a tour real early. Other side is Mcdonald's. Dukes statue is almost over the road which is where a Trolley and your pick up and location is which we used a few days. On some of our tours a pick up location was at Hyatt which was next block from us and we also hired a car from there too. Another great thing we loved was arriving on a red eye we got to the hotel about 8am without much sleep. Looking to leave our bags there before check in later the day. They were able to get us in a room straight away. We all had a great quick sleep and so thankful for that. Yes we would stay there again for sure.

Our priority was a family hotel, clean, affordable, comfortable and CLOSE TO THE BEACH. We checked first on its reviews, googled the images and videos and of course, google maps for its location. On all accounts this hotel meet all our needs and them some.Location: Our goal was beach time and had no plans on staying at the hotel for extended periods of time except to sleep. There is no other affordable hotel that can compare to the location and beach access than Aston Waikiki Circle. From the lobby elevator to the beach is about 50 Meters. We were there for a restful beach vacation and this was it.The hotel was walking distance to everything. * Major Shopping was five minutes away. * McDonalds, Egg and Things, and ABC store right beside hotel. There are ten ABC stores within five minutes of the hotel* a variety of local markets close by depending on day of the week. * we bought grocery staples from the Food Pantry which is a ten minutes walk. * We preferred the surf shop two rights from hotel and one block back. The shop was cheaper and staff much more knowledgable than the Beach rentals.* Dukes is less than a ten minute walk and amazing patio. Service: No matter our questions and needs, the front desk staff were always willing to help. From Beach towels to extra room cleaning to directions and suggestions on restaurants, the staff were always helpful. They also went the extra mile for we arrived late at night (10:00 PM) and the front desk staff person suggested to come back the next morning because they had rooms on higher floors. We lucked out and were moved from Second floor to the thirteenth floor! There is also a tour desk opposite side to the Front Desk Office. We booked our Hanauma Bay tour through the desk with ease.Across the parking lot from the front desk is a Surf Board storage area. The Hotel suggests guests who are leaving to donate their beach things. We used inflatables, beach chairs, boogies boards, beach mats during our stay and when we left, we added a couple of inflatables and beach umbrella to the pile. Rooms: We travel a great deal and appreciate a good affordable, clean and comfy room. Its the only way we can afford to travel so often. Every room in the Circle is the same with two double beds, bathroom (shower no bathtub), large closet, air conditioner, fridge, coffee and tea maker, and small office area and deck space. The only difference is the views. We had an partial ocean view room and loved waking up to the sunrise and seeing the sunset before we were off for a late dinner. We regularly posted photos to Facebook and our friendly regularly asked where we were staying. There are two double beds with bed spreads. The beds for our family of four were soft and comfortable. I did encounter a man checking out early complaining about bed size and room size but clearly he had not researched the hotel before booking. This is not the Hyatt or Outrigger with the duvets on the king beds. Part of the charm of the hotel is the history. It is an older hotel but that was certainly apart of the appeal. The rooms were definitely freshly painted and all furniture were up to date. My suggestion is to stay here before some large chain buys it and tears it down to build a mega hotel. Family: My wife and I traveled with our tall 11 year old son and 8 year old daughter. The hotel was perfect for our family of four. The area was safe especially with a Waikiki Police office two blocks away. We arrived late the first night and walked no problem to Dukes Statue to donate our Leis and shopped at a few stores before going to bed.","Calgary, Canada","Cyberguycanada</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",14,5.0

We stayed 7 nights here. It is in the heart of Waikiki opposite the beach and the lagoon, which was perfect for taking our baby for a swim too (did not miss not having a pool). It is walking distance to all shops and zoos. I recommend to buy a cheap snorkel from abc store and snorkel out at the beach opposite the zoo. The room is nice and new, it is clean and beds are comfortable. We had an oceAnfront room with amazing views across the water. Nothing wrong with the metal cot supplied. The room may be a bit small, but if they got rid of one of the two beds it would of been better for us, then our baby could of played more and it would of felt bigger. Wifi is excellent. The staff were friendly, my only complaint would be check in eg out cot wasnt in our room already and one of our requests wasnt met, but it didnt matter in the long run and our issue was offered to be resolved. Overall i had a very comfortable stay here, was aware of the added amenity fee, as most hotels in Hawaii have it, the hotel made it clear prior to booking.

If we wanted laundry service, we were told to walk to a laundromat several blocks away. There is NOT a single ice machine on any of the 14 floors.

We all stayed at this hotel. 6 adults, 3 rooms. 4 of us had partial ocean view rooms on the 9th floor and the other 2 had a partial ocean view room on the 13th floor. The Partial ocean view room was very nice - but next time I go, I am definitely going to get an ocean view room. One of the ladies cleaning a checked out room, let us take a look at the view from one of these rooms and the view is just amazing!The staff at the hotel were VERY friendly! The day we left, our flight wasnt until 1030PM at night and we didnt reserve a room for the next day so one of the guys at the front, I think his name started with a ""K"", looked into it and with a full hotel, managed to let us stay until our shuttle picked us up at 630PM at a cost of $85. We were so thankful because a bunch of us wanted to go swimming and without the room we wouldnt have been able to.The rooms for this hotel were small. I dont think ive ever stayed in such a small hotel room before but If you dont have more than 2 adults in a room, it works out fine. There is a balcony that you can sit out on with 2 chairs and a little table, there is a good sized closet where you can store your luggage, a safe in the closet and shelving. There is a desk and chair with a coffee maker on top. There is a fridge located under the desk. Two double beds - the beds were comfy but a little bit soft. I think it felt soft because it was only the mattress on top of the bed frame without the boxspring but this was minor - I had good sleeps every night I was there. There is air conditioning in the room and you can adjust it on your own. I did feel a bit cold so I asked for another blanket and they were more than happy to bring one up. The bathroom was small. Only one person could fit in there. The shower is a stand up one person tiled shower - good water pressure. The room was updated and it was very nice. Like an ""aquarium"" type theme. There was a flat screen tv on top of a desk (the TV had a TON of channels to choose from).The location of this hotel is PERFECT. It is literally right across the street from the beach. McDonalds is located on one side of the hotel and a ABC store on the other side. Totally convenient! There is also an ""Eggs N Things"" restaurant beside the ABC store, pretty much part of the hotel, and it is worth checking out. The spam and eggs with rice was delicious! There is usually a long line up in the morning - we waited about an hour to eat. If you feel like having breakfast for dinner, there usually isnt a line. We rented a car and paid the $22 per day. If you are renting a car, I do suggest that you reserve parking before you go because there is pretty much no parking anywhere else as this area is quite busy. On our last day at the hotel, the parking lot was full and no one else could reserve a spot so we are glad we reserved parking ahead of time. It is quite a small parking lot but there were maybe 12 cars that fit the lot when it was full.There is an activity center where you can reserve activities at the hotel but we didnt use this service. The hotel does offer free DVD rentals which was cool, because at the end of the day when you are extremely tired you can just pop in the dvd on the playstation and get comfy in bed. The DVD rental service they have is an automatic computer machine and they give you a room key type card and it takes less than a minute to rent it. They also have wifi (you pay an amenity fee for the week to have this) and the connection was perfect.The hotel is on the ""Waikiki Strip"" and there are tons of restaurants and shopping nearby.We will definielty stay at this hotel again! The location is super convenient. Rooms were always clean. Staff are nice and helpful and there are a lot of things to do. If you have one person that wants to go to the beach - its there. If you have another who wants to shop - its there.We had a great vacation at the Aston Waikiki Circle!

He was very helpful answering my questions and explaining everything at check in. I kept reading tge rooms were small but I had an ocean view room and the only thing that was small in the room was the shower. The room was extremely clean, one of the cleanest I've ever stayed in. Beds were comfortable. Kudos to Housekeeping. Everyone there was very friendly and I felt safe. It was one of the quietest hotels I've ever stayed in. You didn't hear people out in the hallway and only heard a door slam a couple of times. The elevators were very quick even though the hotel was sold out. The location and views were awesome, can't be beat. Only a couple things I wish were a little better, air conditioner was a little noisy, shower was small and would have liked the hot water to have been hotter and they needed more parking.

If you are OK with this, then let me continue. The Hotel is a rather interesting cylinder shaped hotel that is dwarfed by the surrounding properties. That cylinder shape leads to some fantastic views out of your balcony. I reserved a partial ocean view room for my son and me. When we arrived, we were delighted to hear that they ran out of these rooms and upgraded us to a full ocean view on the 11th floor. We stayed in unit 1107 which faced the southwest of the ocean. What was so cool about this unit is that you could also see the homes on the hillside to the north! The room was clean as a pin. The beds were extremely comfortable. The bath featured a standup tile shower. There was a table with the TV and a desk near the back of the room next to a very large closet. The closet had ample space and little cubbys that were perfect for clothes or supplies for the week. There is a small refrigerator in the room, but no microwave. My son is only six, so we both had a lot of space between the two of us. This room would be perfect for a single adult and small child, or a couple with a small child. I would not recommend this for more than two adults due to the smaller size. The housekeeping staff was great, and the front desk was very accommodating. The location is hard to beat. You are on the eastern side of Waikiki directly across the street from a nice swimming area that is protected by waves due to a break wall. Next to that area is a surfboard rental and perfect Waikiki rollers for any level surfer. I managed to surf 3x while I hired a sitter to stay in the room with my son. There is an ABC convenience store very close. You will find yourself popping in there all week long for water, food, souvenirs, etc. What a cool place. There is also a beautiful park that you can walk or drive to. One word of caution; parking spaces are extremely limited at the hotel. I had a car rental for one night and parked in the parking garage (which I had reserved a space earlier that morning). Without that reservation, I would not have been able to park there. The parking is steep; $22 per day. I would say to hire an Uber or Lyft to get around short trips. And don't forget to eat at Eggs n Things downstairs. Awesome stay, I would definitely recommend The Circle Hotel.","Los Angeles, California","255Matt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",3,5.0

Waikiki Circle was perfect for our needs. Yes, it is very bare-bones simple (the lobby is literally outside and you talk to the desk service through a window similar to a movie theater's). We had a rental car, and since the on-site garage was full constantly, we were given directions to a parking lot a few blocks away in which we had to pay for on a daily basis.

If there had been two of us instead of four, I would have rated it higher, simply because of value-for-money in this location. It was located in probably the best part of Waikiki Beach - with a great swimming spot just across the road (a lagoon safe for children), and nearer one of the ends of the beach (so, perhaps, a little quieter). The hotel does not have a pool, but we did not miss it with the lagoon area just downstairs. We stayed here twice and had an ocean front room for one of the stays. This was definitely worthwhile as we had a fantastic view from the balcony of the ocean and the street (we spent an evening watching buskers). The room without a view was a bit claustrophobic.On the negative side - the room was very small to accommodate a family of 4. The beds (2 per room) are very small doubles but comfortable enough for 2 people. The problem was that the room itself was small. It would have been OK for 2 people but was a bit crammed for 4. If you are out all day it isn't an issue, but it isn't such a great room to spend much time.The staff were friendly and helpful, but I didn't like the hotel policy of charging my credit card for the amenity fee and deposit, and then having to wait (which took 2 weeks) for this to be reversed after I paid cash on check-out. Many other hotels hold the credit card details but do not place a charge through (although I do not know the policy of other Honolulu Hotels). Also, I object to the hefty amenity fee that apparently covers a couple of cups of coffee, a newspaper and free DVD rental (in other areas the first things are inclusive with the room price and hardly cost the hotel much, and the latter could be charged for individually). I guess this is standard in Hawaii, but I feel it is wrong to add on these charges when the actual amenities provided are so limited.","Hyderabad, India","Sunjoy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hyderabad, India</strong>",91,3.0

There is a large framed picture/tribute to the original woman who started the hotel. Cool story. I felt honored to be staying there, if only for 2 nights. This is an older establishment, built in the 1950's. It has been well taken care of and refurbished several times. Our room was small with 2 full size beds but had been updated with new carpet, tile, etc. Clean and so very close to the beach. Just walked across the road! Beach towels were provided for you. Kinda noisy at night with the street right outside your window. We had a front ocean view balcony. Definitely used my earplugs. But I was just so pleased to be so close to the beach and so tired from previous travel..... I didn't care!!! Very close to all the shopping and restaurants along the Waikiki strip. There is an $18 amenity fee that we felt was unnecessary. Staff was great. Sometimes our key card wouldn't work, took 3 tries sometimes. There is a restaurant right next to it.

Yes the bathroom was on the smaller side and the shower was tiny but not in s sense that I was shocked. You have a fridge in the room and a coffee maker as well as a safe, hairdryer and wifi. You get the newspaper and free beach towels. We also had a parking spot and during our 5 day stay never had a parking problem. Spaces are small...but really, so is my garage in the city of SF...no biggie. There is a restaurant called Eggs n things which is always busy! But the line moves fast: you order, pay, get seated, served and leave. Food is pretty good! The service: wonderful. Everyone on the staff was extremely friendly and helpful with any of our requests. We rarely heard the other guests, but if you are on a floor with kids, I can see the round shape would be an issue with noise traveling. Don't forget: you are on Waikiki beach...it will be noisy and you will see some unsavory things...it's not a quaint tiny beach town but a big city with beach access.

The hotel staff were all super lovely! We had arrived at 8am and they were able to check us in early (THANK GOODNESS as we had not slept on the flight at all) so we were able to have a nap and freshen up before heading out to explore Waikiki.It is a basic hotel, however the location and the amazing staff made it great value for what we were after. We had an 8th floor ocean view room which was spectacular. Bed was ok, pillows were terrible and flat. Shower is fine. Small fridge was helpful (buy fresh pineapple, yoghurt from ABC store and have it for a cheap brekkie - yum!). We requested a kettle (to have boiled water for baby formula) which was no problem. And they let us use their staff microwave to sterilise stuff. No pool, but the beach across the road was perfect for the little guy. It's enclosed so lovely gentle waves. The wi fi was great!!TIP: The aircon is really noisy (it seems to turn itselfs on to cool the room everytime it goes below a certain temperature), just switch the function to FAN and it will just hum along all night and keep you cool at the same time. This is more for parents travelling with a bub who might be a light sleeper. A HUGE thank you to the lovely Jan and ""The Goddess"" Naomi on the front desk who made us feel so welcome and were always helpful and lovely.

When we checked in the woman at the desk was very friendly, but the man there at the time was not - he just seemed bored and disinterested even when we tried talking to him.

The hotel tacks on an $18 dollar resort fee, which allows you to rent DVDs, but it's really a rip off.

We stayed again, this time in room 805, an ocean front room. If you're going to stay on Waikiki Beach, you really should pay the extra for an ocean front room...great views and ocean breezes. The downside is that the hotel is right on the busy Kalakaua Ave. so road noise can be a problem, especially early in the morning when delivery trucks and street cleaning vehicles start their days. If a light sleeper we suggest you stay as high as you can. If you don't think you will be bothered we suggest something a bit lower, around the 8th to 10th floors. Higher and the ""people watching"" from your balcony won't be as good. We also feel that the ocean front rooms ending in a ""4"" (i.e. 804) have the best angles or views.

We made our way to our rental car and began the congested drive to Waikiki Beach. After about a 30 min drive we arrived at the Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel which isn't much to look at from the outside. We had to drive across the sidewalk and down under the hotel to park. Got out and drug our bags up to the open check in area. I will never forget the wonderful Hawaiian breeze blowing through. The very courteous staff quickly had us checked into our small little corner in paradise. The only draw back was they told us their parking was full and we had to drive 2 blocks down and one block off the beach to the Waikiki Banyon Hotel to park in their garage. At 60$ for a week. I went and parked and my wife stayed back and unpacked. After I walked back to the hotel we walked out onto the partial ocean view balcony and was 100% wowed at the sight before us. Looked down onto the street right dead in the middle of the Waikiki Beach Strip. My wife was exhausted as was I. We flew out of Houston Texas at 8am and landed in HNL at 1:45 PM which was 6:45 PM back home in Texas. She decided that it was time to eat so we walked down to the strip and 2 blocks down to the Cheeseburgers in Paradise and had a couple of very good burgers. After seeing the beach she suggested we go get into our swimming clothes and hit the beach. We had a very relaxing evening on Waikiki Beach. The Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel is right in the middle of the Waikiki Strip. If you do not get a rental this is a great hotel to stay in its in walking distance of everything it seems. The hotel is literally steps away from Waikiki beach just across Kalakaua Avenue. Here are my points for this hotel...The good...,.1. Its one of the best locations on Waikiki beach.2. Its a cheaper option than most of the other hotels.3. The staff is very friendly.4. The most beautiful part of Waikiki Beach is right across the street.5. The activities in the area are numerous. Surfing lessons, paddle boarding, canoeing in the waves, and many other options.6. Rental car isn't needed if you plan on just lounging on Waikiki Beach. The Bad....1. The rooms are small. ( did not affect me much as I was not in my room much).2. You are in a hotel. No bells and whistles. 3. Internet costs a small fortune. ( most places I Hawaii do as well).4. This is not for someone who is used to staying a 4 star establishment.The ugly......I only have 1 ugly1. PARKING<<<<<<<< This hotel does not have enough parking for its guests. Its 1st come 1st serve supposedly. I was there 12 days and checked everyday and was told it was full everyday. I did grow to like the walk to the Banyon but its still a 10 minute walk to my car. Was good exercise though.My final thoughts. If you are a budget conscience minded person this is a great locacation for 4 people or less. I would 100% recommend this hotel for you. If you are a Hilton Rewards Member then its probably not the place for you. There is no on site food or amenities like that. Its got one hug thing in its favor....Location location location. I have stayed here twice and will return for a third trip in July 2017. This will be my 4th trip to Hawaii with 3 times staying in the Circle Hotel right on beautiful Waikiki Beach!!!","Port Neches, Texas","prepballfan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Port Neches, Texas</strong>",19,4.0

Also considering the prices in Honolulu plus add taxes and resort fees with an Ocean View room and they get very expensive fast. But the Aston Circle was very reasonably priced considering and a very nice hotel. The rooms was recently updated in the last couple years and very clean. The hall ways and elevators were a little outdated. But that would be my only complaint. Objectively this would probably be a 3 to 3 1/2 star hotel but because of the views, value, central location and closeness to the beach I would definitely rate it higher.

I Recommend getting either an ocean front or ocean view room(where we stayed). The hotel is also located right off the beach, perfect if you have no transportation and want to be at the beach for the rest of your stay. However, if you have a car rental, you would need to pay 20/night and park at the underground parking just beside the hotel. Their lot is always full and the first night we stayed we had to park at a structure two blocks away. We also stayed on the 3rd floor on our first night, which didn't have the 'ocean view' that we booked. It's more of the parking lot and entrance view. We requested a room on a higher floor, and the staff gave us options the next morning,we left our luggage in the room and when we came back at night we had the best view ever on the 12th floor and our luggage was also taken care of. The rooms are small, two double beds were okay, pillows were soft. Shower is really small. There's a fridge, ps3 for movies or games, closet,office area. There's no fancy hotel lobby, elevator is outside the hotel, check-in is in a 'booth' right next to restaurant. That's where you also ask for ice and beach towels.

There's an Eggs and Things restaurant which was always inexplicably crowded. The rooms might be small if you aren't a veteran traveller, but they were perfectly serviceable and the lanai was great. Close to the Zoo. Of course you pay a resort fee on top of the advertised price which only gets you WiFi and DVD's to watch?Only 14 floors 80 rooms I think, which gives it a sense of intimacy as compared to the corporate megaliths around it. As for Waikiki itself, there is a certain benefit in knowing that you never want to go back to a place again.

The staff was helpful at every corner and seemed more than happy to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.The hotel has a DVD rental kiosk and you are able to rent unlimited DVDs, up to two at a time, to use with the PS3 the room has (awesome!). And they have current and up to date titles as well.The hotel is also connected to ""Eggs N' Things Eggspess"" restaurant - this is the best breakfast I think I've ever had. My Uncle recommend this place and it did not disappoint!! WELL worth it.The room was small-ish. Two queen size beds and a large nightstand nearly took up the width of the room and the bathroom was kind of small, compact rather. But it was perfect for what we wanted as we didn't want to spend the day(s) in the hotel room.We got a partial ocean view and once you stepped onto the deck...it was perfect. Also the sliding door opens so half the room is exposed - *that* was nice. The black out curtains were nice and the sun came through on the sides and top - but I'm not complaining as that helped in the waking us up. Also - the A/C was amazing.The beds (and linens) were comfortable, not the best but certainly not the worse - the pillows were awesome though. However - the towels had an odd smell. Almost like too much bleach and too hot of a dryer smell - and they were rough.The room didn't smell, which was really nice. Sometimes you get that ""hotel stench"" or ""we just cleaned"" smell. Nothing like that here - and I think it is because when they clean they have the sliding door open to air it out.Overall if I ever come back to Oahu/Waikiki I would stay here again. Directly across from the beach, a smaller hotel (only 14 floors) and towards the end of the Waikiki strip. It's a really nice hotel and I do highly recommend it.","Seattle, Washington","renlady_86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",3,5.0

When we got into our rooms they were clean and well presented, the bathroom was very clean too and all the rooms had balconies that you could sit on and relax, the views from the balcony were ok from the room as you could look over the beach and watch some beautiful sunsets. There were two large small beds in the room that would not sleep two people in each so me and the wife had to have a bed each, this was ok though as the rooms were stuffy but when you have the air con unit on made the room like a freeze that was really nice after you have been on the beach all day.The hotel was 50 yards from the beach, and this beach was very clean. The hotel also give you towels to go over to the beach and these are collected from the front desk and they were clean and very helpful, as I don't like to have sand all over my room which this stopped.The hotel room cleaning service was great and they were very helpful and took pride in the job they did, one day we didn't want the room cleaned but they came to our door with clean towels anyways which was very nice of them and they took the one's we had.

Yes, it has a great view IF YOU SCORE A ROOM WITH A VIEW. My room was looking at the hotel next to us and at the parking lot. I was surprised to see so many high ratings for this hotel based on that criterion alone.If you have a rental car be aware that you may not be able to park at the hotel. At check in we were informed that the 22 parking garage spaces were filled and we needed to park at the garage approximately 1/2 a mile away ($20 per day, cash only). To access the hotel with your car you have to cross one of the busiest sidewalks in Waikiki and then pull off a 5 point turn to exit the hotel (not fun). My next clue that this was a sub-par hotel was that the check in window has a glass front between you and the staff (there must be a reason for that and it's weird).After exiting the elevator you'll feel like you are in a cheap Mexican spring break hotel and there is no key card access required to access the floors of the hotel. In a previous review, the management of this hotel reported that key card access is required to use the elevator, THIS IS NOT TRUE. That means that any Yahoo off the street can gain access to your floor and be at your door. The lock on the sliding glass door had been previously tampered with which indicated to me that there is a problem with break-ins (further confirmed with them recommending the use of the in-room safe). Due to those signs, I barricaded my door to the hallway at night.The wind noise howled through the room all night. My co-worker reported that his deck furniture shifted back and forth throughout the night. The in-wall AC unit never turned off all night (annoying).The rooms themselves are tiny. You can almost take a shower and sit on the toilet at the same time. Beds are tiny too.I have stayed at 4 different hotels in Waikiki (on government per diem rates) and this one is the worst thus far. The only positive things that I have to say about this hotel is that the staff was friendly and the room itself was very clean. All 5 of my co-workers and I checked out after one night and they agree with this assessment.","Gilbert, Arizona","carpmaster_22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gilbert, Arizona</strong>",5,2.0

I came to Oahu on a business trip and needed a clean and reasonably-priced place to stay. The Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel was very clean without a lot of frills. Basically, you get a room right on the Waikiki strip with a great view and accessibility to everything. As you may see in other reviews, the hotel is quite physically a circle. So, all of the rooms are wedged-shaped. They are a updated and clean with two double beds, a very small bathroom and a small work space for your laptop. There is also a small closet. This room is not intended for hanging out in for an extended period of time. It is intended for 2 to maybe 4 people to sleep in. Hey! You're in Oahu! What are you doing just hanging out in your room for anyway?There is a balcony with each room that holds two connected seats with a table in between. This was perfect for sitting out on after working each day, watching the ocean, drinking a local micro brew and eating some local snack mix that I bought at one of the many ABC souvenir stores that are around. This hotel is right on the main drag with a lot of people walking up and down the street. So, if you like to people watch, then there is a lot of entertainment to be had just sitting on the balcony.","Avon, Indiana","FamilyGuyFromIndy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Avon, Indiana</strong>",19,4.0

Great stay for teenagers as they have a playstation in room and free movie rentals to keep them occupied when you are getting ready or relaxing after the beach or before dinner. We enjoyed the free use of beach mats , chairs , rubber rafts and tubes to float on as well as boogie boards used on the north shore. We left a couple of boogie boards for others to enjoy when our stay was over. They also had a couple of serf boards that could save someone some serious cash on rentals. This hotel has an eighteen dollar resort fee that covers all of the above mentioned. It will cost you an additional twenty dollars a day to park your rental car. What I liked most about this hotel is that it is located directly across the street from the beach, walking distance to many good restaurants and shopping, amazing views from lanai.

We added my name on the reservation since I was going to arrive before them, agreed to pay the extra 30 per night and I myself was going to be in charge of paying that, I figured I also wanted an upgrade so I was going to pay that myself as well. Upon my arrival the guy at the front desk seemed pretty bored and I arrived towards the end of his shift it seemed like, he barely cared to help me out said my reservation had been canceled it was absurd because my mom was on her way, an then he changed the story saying it was changed to a later day, I was so confused and outraged and there was no way this could have happened... I asked him to figure this out because there was obviously something wrong, he didn't care I asked him if he could hold my luggage while i went to grab my son something to eat and he rudely answered No you are not a guest here! I almost cried and he still didnt help me out. I had to walk to the restaurant with my son luggage bags and everything. Came back and still had to call Orbitz myself.

The location is fantastic - you are literally steps from the beach.

I can't recommend the ocean front view experience enough.The rooms at the Circle are pretty basic but clean, comfortable and spacious. The balcony is fantastic for relaxing and enjoying the sunset from. See the attached picture - but a picture really can't do it justice.Don't bother booking one of the upgraded 'ocean view' rooms in advance. They'll sell you an upgrade at the front desk - haggle. I think I ended up getting it for like $10 extra/night after extending my stay a bit.Yeah - this isn't a resort hotel with a pool etc etc. But you can always buy a day pass at one of the larger resorts/spas if you want it.

Also, parking is an extra fee and every day had a sign saying it was full (we only rented a car for one day and didn't park there.) Also there is an additional ""resort fee"" that is very common in Oahu. I thought of it as the charge for wifi. So, with all that out of the way, here's what I enjoyed about the ACH. First read about the women who opened the hotel. She was quite extraordinary. The rooms are not huge but perfect for 2 adults or a family of 4 (with smaller kids.) There is a microwave and a desk and a safe. The rooms are clean despite its age. It smells fresh and is cheery. The best features are the view and the balcony. The higher the better! There's nothing like waking up to that view!Also, on the first floor is ""eggs and Things"". It is a great place for breakfast but get there early or call it in and take it across the street to enjoy it right on Waikiki! Their juices are fresh squeezed and the pancakes are so good we went there twice! Finally, the location is wonderful! Most things in Waikiki are walkable. The Duke statue is right across the street as well as a free hula show on Wednesdays (although there are better free hula shows at the Halekulani on the weekends and my favorite was at the Ilikai on Friday & Sunday Nights. On Fridays you can see the fireworks from the Hawaiian Hilton). There is shopping down the street a McDonalds next door for you fast food fans. Oh, I also found the rooms to be very quiet. I'm not sure if it was the rooms or the clientele but unlike some hotel experiences where you hear doors slamming and voices echoing in the halls there was none of that. While nothing is cheap in Honolulu, I felt this hotel was a good value for my money. Other tips:If you want to get out of Waikiki the bus system is great! We took the bus to Pearl Harbor, downtown to see Iolani Palace (take the tour and go on Friday for the free concert on the lawn. It's quite charming!) and to Kailua. In Kailua we rented bikes to get to the beach and biked to Lanakai beach as well. Lanakai beach would be better described as a bunch of paths between houses with various sized amounts of beach area in between peoples back yard. It was breathtaking and totally worth the hunt. Taking the bus in Honolulu was so much easier than fighting traffic and trying to find parking. We had a tour guide-- Vince take us to Hanauma Bay since the bus ride was long and it's best to get there early. It was very reasonable. He set us up with the snorkeling gear but you still have to stand in line and watch the movie. I rented a car for one day to drive around the island and go to the North Shore. I found a car rental place that was about 6 blocks from the hotel (if you are a member at Costco you can get good prices.). There is an Enterprise and maybe a Herz both at that location. Anyway, I walked to pick up the car and returned it that evening. Some highlights of my drive around the island were: seeing whales breach on my hike on the Makapu trail to the lighthouse, having shrimp from Giovanni's food truck, enjoying the different views and pace and enjoying a shave ice with ice cream at Matsumoto in Halewia. I kept hearing about this and thought what's the big deal about a snow cone? No comparison... You've gotta try them! I stopped at the Dole Plantation and I would have been happy with just a picture. I walked in & was bombarded with a super sweet smell and Pineapple items everywhere. I wasn't impressed. I ended my day by driving to",,Susmpls,6,4.0

This was our first trip to Hawaii, and we were very happy with the Aston Waikiki Circle. The location is very convenient to the beach (right across the street) as well as convenient to all the shops in Waikiki. One of the best-rated breakfast spots (Eggs and Things) shares the same building, and you get a discount through the hotel. McDonalds is right next door. The hotel staff was very pleasant, and our rooms were clean and well-maintained. The hotel provides as many fresh beach towels as you need (my wife asked for 6 for two of us!). You won't be disappointed with this hotel. Other reviews state the rooms are small, but we only used our room to sleep and shower so we were fine with the size. The shower and bathroom were perfectly fine (I'm 5'8"" 250lbs). The room may be on the small side for American standards, but it's very comparable to European rooms in which we've stayed. We also rented a car for the week and kept in the hotel's garage for an extra $20 per day. The garage is directly below the hotel, and incredibly easy to get in and out of with the remote provided. Here's a tip, if you want chairs, and you will spend more than 8 hours on the beach during your stay, go to KMart or Walmart and buy the foldable beach chairs for $30 each. What's nice is you can then take them to any other beach on the island that you want (Kailua Beach Park is nicer than Waikiki in my opinion).When I researched the hotel, I was unsure of the location because of the view of the water from Google Earth. The water has a lot of discoloration which we found out later are rocks on the bottom. The rocks are fairly smooth, and can be walked on with bare feet. The water is beautiful and the beach was perfect!Everything about this hotel is convenient, and we will definitely be back on future trips.","Downingtown, Pennsylvania","jimcomly1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Downingtown, Pennsylvania</strong>",10,5.0

We already knew about the daily fee charged for 'services' prior to arriving and just factored that into our budget. This was still a third of the price of some of the other beachfront hotels along the strip. Would stay again. The ""Eggs n Things"" restaurant just out the front doors always had a queue and provides some very good value meals (although the American's obsession with obscene piles of cream is evident here).

Last visit I tried the Eggs 'n Things Eggspress located in the hotel and took a closer look. For this trip, trying to reduce lodging costs since I knew shopping expenses would be high (did you know Louis Vuitton is slightly cheaper in HI vs. the mainland?), we decided to give the Circle a try, and we were pleasantly surprised! Its location and budget-friendly rates are main selling points.The hotel was opened in 1962 by Emma Kwok Chung, the first Asian woman to own a hotel in Waikiki. Its circular design is meant to look like a Chinese lantern. It's situated on the eastern part of Waikiki's main street, Kalakaua Ave., just past the Duke Kahanamoku statue, where there are no building on the ocean side of the street. Thus, the hotel as direct views of the beach and ocean.There are 14 stories, with 8 rooms per floor. The ""lobby"" is open-air, behind Eggs 'n Things, the front desk is situated behind glass, like a theatre ticket window. There are 1-2 staff members at the window. There are 2 key-accessed elevators, also used by the staff, and a tour desk. Beach equipment and towels are available. The front desk folks were efficient, some were friendly. I don't know if they do concierge-type duties. I found the Waikiki Ambassadors, who wear fluorescent green tops and are found all over, more helpful. We booked an oceanfront room online. After booking, the rate decreased twice before our visit. There are 3 oceanfront rooms per floor, and of course these are the costliest, relatively speaking. The other room categories, going towards the rear of the hotel, are Ocean View (2/floor), Partial Ocean View (2/floor), and Standard (1/floor--faces a garage). We were on the 13th floor, and had almost 180 degree views of the sea from the balcony. Note the balconies have railings on 3 sides, so are rather unprotected and subject to wind. You cannot see Diamond Head from any room. The rooms are indeed compact, but well-designed, making maximum use of the space. There are 2 full beds--fine for 1-2 people, tight for 3-4. The flat screen TV and Playstation sit on a dresser/desk with a few drawers and a stool. There's another desk by the closet, which has nicely designed shelving. There's a mini-fridge and a safe that has a key, not coded entry. The wall-mounted A/C worked well, and I didn't mind the noise--it helps block out noise from the street. The bathroom is also small, room enough only for one. The stall shower is particularly tight. I was surprised the glasses were real glass. Niggles: there was only one set of drapes (only block-out, no semi-sheer), the sliding door did not slide easily. Ice must be requested at the front desk.The rooms and entire hotel are whimsically themed with aquatic features and colours--the carpet, photos in the room and elevators, the headboard, bathroom door, tiled wall in the lobby. There's a beach bucket and shovel and plastic goldfish in the bathroom.There's a mandatory amenity fee ($18.85 per night) that includes WiFi, newspaper (USA Today), in-room coffee/tea, the safe, local calls, DVD's available from a machine in the lobby.Eggs 'n Things offers a 10% discount to hotel guests. Note that this branch is not a full-service restaurant. You order before entering, pay the cashier, then wait for a table. Everything's disposable (plates and cutlery). Lines can get very long for breakfast, but it's served all day. The place is open 6am-2pm, and reopens 4pm-10pm, when there are additional dinner offerings. The famous pancakes are quite good (they sell the mix). There's a McDonald's next door, and also one of the larger ABC Stores.If you have a car, parking at the hotel is TIGHT. Overflow parking is at the Aston Waikiki Banyan a few blocks away. This is where we parked--access is easier despite the walk to the hotel. If you just plan to stick around Waikiki, a car isn't needed; there are oodles of shops and restaurants within walking distance, including the high-end shops towards the west. Amusingly, when staff at Bottega Veneta and Louis Vuitton asked where we were staying, they did not know of the Circle.In the end, this turned out to be a fine stay--great location, relatively inexpensive, charming. We would definitely consider the Circle again should we choose to stay in Waikiki. However, I still would like to try the Kahala someday, and there will be a new Four Seasons at Ko Olina in the future.",Los Angeles CA,"pillowsofwanderlust</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles CA</strong>",1202,4.0

We have 3 big suitcases and 1 medium suitcase and the room looks like it will be too cramped for the four of us.The cabinet have plenty of shelves where to store clothes so we used them and store 3 suitcases inside the closet. The room got more bigger after I organized all our things. The bathroom is super tiny but this really didn't bother us. They have double sized beds and it was the most comfortable hotel bed I've slept in. The room is super clean including the bathroom. The aircon was sometimes noisy. The room has a safety box which I've used.

If it's 10 seconds from the beach, it's 5 minutes from the heart of all the Waikiki shopping - was great for us who didn't plan to spend too much time indoors. The room had all the necessities: comfortable beds, good shower, free wifi, tv/fridge, etc - and a balcony with a partial beach view (although we paid a bit extra for this). The staff was lovely and helpful at check-in (we arrived late at night); they had towels at no cost to take to the beach each day; cleaning staff - two thumbs up. The thing to keep in mind here in Honolulu (or other parts of Hawaii) in general is that unless you have a car or the only thing you want to do is lay at the beach or shop, you really need to plan ahead. From Pearl Harbor to Luau's to snorkeling outings - you have to sign up with tour groups so they pick you up from the hotel, etc. The concierge can help you with this but do make sure you don't miss them (we did as we'd be out before they opened and returned after close). PS, here's a tip: while getting ready in the room, have the 'Hawaii' channel on and you get some good ideas about sightseeing (we learned for example that if you buy the Pearl Harbor passport tour on the site, you get a free mug - they sure don't offer it themselves but once we asked, we got them; and the touring companies charge you for things that are actually free!...)","London, United Kingdom","zhanna_povaliaev</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",24,4.0

Absolutely wonderful front desk staff and our room cleaning lady was so sweet. Naomi checked us in, and she made us feel like regulars. We felt so relaxed and at home. So friendly and accommodating. Westjet Vacations had us booked in an Oceanview room, but Naomi moved us up to 905, an Oceanfront room, for just $ 20.00 USD more per night. John took care of the details the next day, had our luggage moved up and new keys ready. We saw John all week, always there to help and took care of us. A lot of people have already commented on the rooms. We can add we thought it was really unique being a circle shaped hotel. It's very different to step out of an elevator and see the walls curving away in each direction. The rooms are clean and feel new. Carpets appear brand new. Furniture is contemporary and quite nicely fit in the room. Our dresser had a stone top. Our room had a queen size bed. Nice mattress, we slept better there than at home. With that bed, the room was spacious and perfect for two people. A lot of nice touches like an ottoman that splits open to give you a tray to carry drinks or food in. The in-room safe was a great convenience. The deck is a nice size with two outdoor chairs and a table. Looking down on the giant banyan tree and the waves breaking onto the beach was so relaxing. The drapes slide all the way over to the side to give you two monstrous windows, one a door that slides all the way open ( room for three people to walk out side by side ) and it lets that beautiful Pacific - Hawaiian sweet air blow into the room. Air conditioner was great, some people complain about the hum from it but I liked it because I need white noise to sleep and it drowned out the street noise at night.I have no problem with that $ 18.00 fee. We enjoyed the amenities, the Wifi worked great and we were posting pictures like mad on Facebook every night, and one day after a real nasty sunburn I stayed in the room all day and surfed the web. The towels, movies, newspaper, coffee - all good. The free floaties were also a cool addition.Yes, we could have opted for a room in one of those massive hotels. But, I live in hotels for work half the year, and I selected this one for location, amenities, access to the beach, access to shopping, the whimsical flavor and the price was right. I recommend that you get an ocean front, and definitely you want to be high up as you can get for the view, and to get away from the smells from Egg's N Things and the sound of delivery vehicles. Thanks John and Naomi, this was our very first vacation after 24 years of marriage and of course our first trip to Hawaii. You two made us feel like family. We LOVE your hotel.

Ok so it doesn't have its own pool - who needs it you have the ocean a stone throw away...The ONLY thing I will say is that hiring a parasol and sun loungers on Waikiki beach adds up $50 a day for 1 parasol and 2 sun loungers... so if you can see if you can buy your own and give it to the hotel after you leave... they have tons of stuff you can borrow to take to the beach such as body boards and inflatables...The room has a decent size fridge which allowed us to have bread, butter, cheese, deli meats etc so we can make our own sandwiches for the beach as Waikiki is quite expensive and eating out three times a day adds up...The room is ok in size, bathroom quite small but enough room for one person... two double beds in the room which is ok and a decent sized dressing area with a wardrobe and desk...There is a concierge desk in the foyer which is nice to have and they are more than helpful...A local newspaper is left outside your room every morning and there is a DVD rental machine in the foyer with free rentals...

My room had two double beds, smallish shower and bathroom, separate study area with safe, and desk. The hotel has no lobby as such and far more popular than the hotel itself is the ionic 'Eggs and things' restaurant which is adjoining the front desk area and has been around as long as the hotel, 1960's I think. Expect a long line virtually all day.So the pros? The hotel has absolute beach front access, across the road from Dukes statue and the trolley stop (to Ala Moana), it's surrounded by cafes, restaurants and ABC stores, not to mention the views and that everyone knows the hotel by name. The cons? The ridiculous $18 a night 'resort' fee for sub par wifi access, safe, coffee/tea, newspapers, beach towels, free DVD's (which are commonly out of the most popular recent releases). Most hotels give you these as part of the price. If you can get a good rate I would recommend, however at the $300 AUD a night I ended paying perhaps I would class this property as overpriced for the current Aussie traveller.","Sydney, Australia","littletokyo00</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",123,3.0

The bathroom too was compact. One other downside I have to mention is that our room was right above the ""eggs n things"" restaurant and as soon as you opened the patio, all you could smell was food being cooked all day/night, and the generator humming away from the adjacent hotel.This was really disappointing after having paid a lot of money for one nights stay. This room is certainly not big enough to accomodate 4 adults and medium sized suitcases. As the hotel's own car park was full, (you would think with an advanced booking there would be a space reserved) we had to go to the sister hotel and pay an extra $20 so that we could park our car for the night.Overall disappointed, nice small room if there's 2 of you.","London, United Kingdom","sunshine7301</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",14,4.0

Seems pretty standard for Hawaii hotels (although usually you're paying for a pool etc.).Room: Average, bit dated, but did the job. We only needed somewhere to sleep and didn't spend much time at the hotel apart from for this.Negatives: Room was quite noisy at night time. Add to this the racket the air con unit in the room makes and conditions aren't great for a good night's sleep. But we managed OK for 1 night.

This hotel was ideal.My only complaint would be that it was quite noisy in the room at night - that may have been our particular room (407) being close to something noisy outside (like the next hotel's air con unit or something - nothing I could see in the dark when I looked).If you're staying here definitely check out Eggs'n'things which is a restaurant/diner located on the street next to the hotel.

We could open our lanai doors from about midnight until 4 AM to listen to the surf, but had to close them again as the traffic started up again early. The streets were filled primarily with tour groups from Japan with lots of teenagers. Albeit they were polite and not rowdy, but just the masses of people was overwhelming to us.

Very different than the obviously mentally ill people who were quietly hallucinating and not bothering anyone. I think the nasty panhandlers spoiled the visit for us too. They would nice ask for money and we didn't give it they cursed us with foul language. Lots of very expensive designer stores like Rolex, Tiffany, Coach etc.but we had no interest in those stores or enough money to patronize those stores.

My boyfriend, sister, and I stayed for 4 days/3 nights late last year. What we loved the most was the ocean front view that accompanied our room. Waking up to the sea's vast horizon and witnessing the beautiful sunset from our balcony was most memorable...and we didn't even have to break our budgets for it. The room itself was a bit tiny with double beds, but it was pleasingly decorated and evoked a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. Consequently, the bathroom was also small and cramped, but still functional. Who really stays cooped up in their rooms for long anyway when on a beach vacation? We mainly used it to sleep and shower before our planned activities for each day.The building itself is dated - there's really no lobby. There's check-in walk-up windows and the elevators to the hotel are right outside. Eggs 'N Things is on the same level, but anticipate long lines if you plan to try their famous breakfast.

It is more expensive than previous years since taken over by by Aston.One bad feature is no microwave. If you need something heated for your children, the front desk is very kind to heat something up for you in their microwave.The showers aren't very good for water pressure, but the bathrooms are nice and adequate. The ice machine is located behind the front desk and the staff needs to give it to you, which they are very good about doing,, no complaints from them how many times you get it.The movie rental machine is great. My kids used it everyday, 2-3 times if they wanted.The beach across the street is perfect. Great for kids. One downfall is the hotel has a 4 person limit per room (code) and we had to rent 2 rooms. Parking is very limited under the hotel. You may have to park off-site a night before space opens up below the hotel. Beds could be rotated for more comfort, as people sit on one side of the beds. Linens could be a little newer on some days- they vary. Basically love this hotel and wouldn't want to stay off the beach anywhere else. We will stay there again when we return.

The hotel is a five minute walk to the zoo and approximately a 45 minute walk to Diamond head.

Given the price that we paid, we were pleasantly surprised by our experience, and our stay, while uneven, greatly exceeded our expectations. Here’s the good news:• Good value, great view – we paid a fraction of what it costs at other oceanfront hotels in Waikiki. For a no frills vacation, the Circle delivers. Upon arrival, we upgraded our room to a partial ocean view for $10/night more which was worth it, though we did have to walk out onto the balcony to enjoy seeing the beach/ocean/Diamond Head. I’ve stayed at the nearby Moana Surfrider before and was thoroughly taken by its elegant colonial ambiance. This time I was still able to enjoy the Surfrider’s lobby and picture perfect outside terrace, but I saved several hundred bucks by walking a few blocks back to the Aston after I was done.• Location – You’re right across the street from Waikiki Beach which is great. I don’t think there are any hotels that have a better location in Waikiki. You do have to walk across Kalakaua Avenue to get to the sand, but that’s fine. You’re right in the middle of the shopping and the heart of the action. This stretch of Waikiki has a great selection of very upscale shops, and more foot traffic than Vegas. As an aside, there sure are a lot of people in Waikiki.• Clean rooms – The hotel rooms are small but clean and tidy. Our room with two double beds didn’t feel cramped, but there’s definitely no extra space. The basics were all there: small single-sink bathroom and even smaller shower, one set of three drawers, mini fridge, and a closet with a safe (though no iron/ironing board).• DVD Collection – Right in front of the elevator there’s a kiosk, very similar to a RedBox, which offers free DVD’s to borrow. It was a fairly large collection, and their new releases were on par with RedBox and way better than Netflix Instant or Amazon. You play the movies on a Playstation which wasn’t too difficult to figure out. Nice amenity. Wi-fi comes with the resort fee and worked on all of our devices.• Breakfast - We didn’t go to Eggs N’ Things which is right there in the non-lobby. I couldn’t believe how long the line was. I wondered if some tour bus social media site gave it a great review because by mid-morning there was a line all the way to the street. I did like having a breakfast option on property.• Housekeeping – Rooms were cleaned well each night. I had trouble with the TV remote and someone came up within minutes to show me how to use.• Circle shape – The circle shape makes for some quirky hallways, garage driveways and room configurations, but in the end it was kind of cool. They should figure out how to have a rooftop terrace.Here’s the not quite so good:• Lobby Ambiance – There actually isn’t a lobby. You pull into the hotel carport and there’s a covered exterior breezeway. When I had to back my car out, I was worried about hitting people standing in line. You check in at a window which is behind the glass like at a bank. The front desk staff ranged from graciously friendly to somewhat grouchy. It’s all fine I guess, but if you’re looking for something upscale, the Aston will be disappointing.• Noise – This stretch of Waikiki seems to have a lot police cars. One night the street noise woke us up, another night it was crying babies and our last night it was people talking at the elevator early in the morning. Fortunately, the A/C drowns out most of it.• Parking – We were told on our first night that the on-site garage was full and that we’d have to park at the Aston Banyan’s circuitous garage which was four blocks down and two blocks over. This was a hassle when we came and left a couple of times, especially late at night, but on our second two nights we were able to park in the garage on-site which was tight but way more convenient (the $20/night to park at the Circle vs. $15 at the Banyan was a pretty good deal).So as I think back on our stay at the Aston Waikiki Circle, a lot of people demand way more from their hotel, but if your needs are on the spartan side and you want to stay in the middle of Waikiki within walking distance to the beach and shopping, this is a great value option which I would return to again and recommend to friends.",Los Angeles,"HarryfromLA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",173,4.0

It's not a luxury hotel brand - there are a handful of those everywhere nearby, and I've stayed at a number of them, but this is a different type of experience.Location is fantastic, being directly across the street from Waikiki Beach. The views are fantastic (if you stay oceanview or better). There are currently only 8 properties that are beachfront on Waikiki, and this is about as close as you can get without paying the premium to be on the beach.Right on Kalakaua, so it's easy to walk everywhere. The Pink Trolley has a stop located about a block away, and you can catch The Bus (if you're headed to Diamond Head, or elsewhere) on Kuhio, 2 blocks away.We also took a couple of tours and rented a car during our stay, all of which were from the Hyatt Regency, located on the next block over, making it very convenient. There's an ABC store right outside the hotel, which is great for those quick 'run out to get something' trips.The 'lobby', or open area with the front desk, is quite small, and doesn't have a great welcoming factor, but is clean, and, considering that it is shared with the entrance to Eggs'n'things, not congested.There are two elevators servicing the entire tower, but we found that we did not have to wait very long.We were in an oceanfront room on the 9th floor. The oceanfront rooms are the ones found directly in front of the elevators, and we worried that we may have some noise from other guests, but this did not prove to be a problem.The rooms, as mentioned, are small. The washroom is definitely tight (reminded me of my first studio apartment)! There were 2 doubles in our room, which worked for us. We mostly lived out of our suitcases. The A/C, which many have complained is loud, is definitely something to get used to. We found that changing the setting to 'COOL' instead of 'Auto' helped, as it was most annoying when it kept turning off and starting up all the time.The noise from Kalakaua was definitely noticeable. Especially, as I noticed that the glass door does NOT sit properly in its' track, which causes a gap between the door and the wall. We attempted to move it shut, but it wouldn't budge.Housekeeping was great about cleaning the room, though we felt like we could have used another towel or two. They do supply beach towels in the room.Security was good - the elevators require a card key, and while there were no chains on the locks, the dead bolts were heavy and the doors were secure.I think this hotel certainly offers good value if priced right. Very basic, no frills, but clean, comfortable, and safe.The daily resort fee has steadily been climbing over the years, and I find that it is getting overpriced.

We don't spend a lot of time in our room anyway and the Circle has everything we need at an affordable price. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Beach towels are supplied which saves having to pack one in your luggage (more room for shopping). The hotel is also reasonably quiet for Waikiki.The only negative is the $18 per night amenity fee which is a bit steep. On our previous visits they delivered the local paper to the room and had free coffee in the lobby in the morning, now there is a coffee maker in the room and they still deliver the paper but unless you use the wi fi (which I heard from others is quite slow) you really don't get much for your money.

I had a family of 4 going to Hawaii, and needed to save somewhere. Got to the hotel, and they had offered an upgrade to ""ocean front"" for only $5 more a night. SOLD! Originally, that would have been an additional $25/night.The staff was very friendly and knowledgable. The hotel had free DVD rentals in the lobby, for those times when you didn't want to be on the beach. Room was very small, especially for 4 people. However, we quickly figured out that you are NEVER in the room (except to sleep).This hotel is across the street from Waikiki Beach. In fact, the section in front of the hotel is ""walled off"" to be calm, so it was perfect for all the families with little ones. That wasn't us, we wanted to snorkel and surf. But that was only 25 yards up or down the beach. Nice.Back to the room. The lanai (porch) was great. Sat out there every day enjoying morning coffee, or nightly adult beverages, just watching the waves, surfers, and passerby's, yes, all from my hotel room. The best part was the next to the last day, while sitting on the lanai in the morning, we were watching the humpback whales breach out in the ocean. Yes, from our room.Don't get me wrong, this is a no-frills room/hotel. However, when on a budget, wanting to spend more money on my experiences, than my sleep, I will stay there again.","Phoenix, Arizona, United States","WOnet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona, United States</strong>",15,4.0

We went from partial ocean view to ocean view, and it was well worth every penny. We were on the 11th floor room 1106, this is the perfect side to be on, as you have shade in the morning for your tea/breakfast and then you have the sunset in the evening. The rooms are small but for two people it's perfect size, as it has two double beds. I would say they'd be too small for a family of 4. The great thing with this hotel is they provide you with the beach floaties and beach mats and unlimited beach towels!! We used these everyday. As we drink tea not coffee, they got us a kettle right away! The rooms only have showers but are a nice size and people closing their doors seemed to be a little Noisey (echo). The air conditioning worked awesome. They give you a coupon book when you get there, be sure to go through it or carry it with you as it's only for people who are staying at the Aston and there are some great deals, we saved on transportation and meals. The travel booth lady named Rachael was also so helpful. All the staff was so polite, sorry I don't have all your names.

If you are looking to swim with the dolphins, be sure to check out the Dolphin Quest at the Kahala Resort, so amazing!!!! In march my family and I had done the swim at the Sea Life park but I would rate this one is way better. If you need a taxi, call Charlie's Taxi as they are a local company and rates seem to be lower, they offer $29 flat rate from the airport, I would recommend this because if you get on one of the big buses, you end up stopping at every hotel and it takes like 2 hours, this way you get where your going in a half an hour.","Vernon, Canada","Amy G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vernon, Canada</strong>",25,4.0

This hotel was our first impression of Hawaii, so maybe we were expecting better. But, as soon as we arrived, we realized that there is no hotel lobby. The ""front desk"" is actually a room with a plexi-glass (bullet-proof glass?) window where you can attempt to communicate with a hotel employee through a hole cut in it. Given how loud it was outside, it was very difficult to hear what the person behind the ""desk"" was saying. He wasn't exactly unpleasant, but not exactly welcoming either. After straining and asking him to repeat several times, we were finally able to figure out what we needed to do to get parked and to our room.So, parking...we paid to park in the hotel garage, which was actually built below the building. It only could hold about maybe 20 cars, and that's packed in like sardines. We drove down there, and there were no spaces available. So my wife had to go back up to the ""desk"" and ask them what to do. One of the employees came down and moved a car to make room for ours. Finally...parked!We made our way up to the room, which was tiny. I had expected this from the other reviews I had read, and didn't really have a problem with it. And, it was clean, so that counted for a lot, in my opinion. However the ""partial ocean view"", while true, was actually dominated by a view of the side of the building next door, a parking garage, and a trash dumpster. Yes, we could see the ocean from our balcony, but just barely. Overall, it wasn't a pleasant view.The room (and entire hotel, for that matter) was old, and in need of a renovation. Strange noises woke us from our jet-lagged sleep throughout the night. It kept occurring to us that this seemed more like a Spring Break retreat for drunken teenagers than a nice hotel room for vacationing adults. Except is was overpriced, which would likely scare away any partying college student.Overall, I just can't recommend this hotel. If it didn't cost as much as it did, I would have at least given it another star and advised that you get what you pay for. But in this case, we didn't even get that. After staying on some other islands and coming back to Honolulu, we stayed up the street at the Outrigger Beach Resort. While much more expensive, at least we felt like at the Outrigger, we got what we paid for. I hate to give bad reviews, but I would have to advise that unless they renovate the Circle, or lower the prices, you should stay away.","Maryland Heights, Missouri","TheCranium</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Maryland Heights, Missouri</strong>",13,2.0

When I got there, the other property refused us parking, saying they were no longer affiliated with Aston properties. Came back and desk clerk went down to the very small parking area (space for about 12 cars only) and moved his car and parked it in the handicapped slot. We were told that the employees park there so they do not have to pay to park elsewhere. So how many of the 12 slots are taken by employees, while guests have to pay $17 for parking whether there is space or not. (BTW: Circle's reservation and on line site shows $15 parking.)I am nor giving up on Aston Properties, but the Aston Circle is off my list as well anyone who asks us about places to stay in Oahu.Edward A","San Antonio, Texas","EdinHawaii</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",15,3.0

Great Location right across the street from the beach. Walking distance to many restaurants and bars. We tried the Egg's and things eatery at the entrance for breakfast , for the same money, we went to other eateries the rest of the week and got better food and service and didn't have to wait on a long line to get in.

It was something like our 8th stay, so we knew what to expect. The location is just fantastic, you can't find a more affordable beachfront spot. We splurged on an oceanfront room and requested a high floor and an early checkin - we were extremely surprised when we arrived well before check in (flights for Aus always arrive so early into HNL...) to find both requests had been honoured. We walked into room 1404 and the view was simply breathtaking. (Our last visit had been just before our wedding 2 years ago and I think the staff's levels of enthusiasm and customer service have definitely improved since then, the service was excellent during our brief stay). The rooms themselves have been renovated in the past 3 years and are fun and beachy, though not overly spacious. Definitely adequate for a couple, the main thing is the view anyway. Keep in mind that Honolulu is a big city, and that Waikiki is a busy place - there will be noise late into the night, but the AC at the Circle helps block it out, as do earplugs. The ocean pool across the street is a great spot, it's protected and much like a regular pool. If you get a grassy spot early enough, you can get some shade and sun protection as well.

While the price is great for Waikiki (150/night with AAA discount) - the rooms are really really small. I don't know how 4 people could stay here (all rooms have 2 beds) because my husband and I were tripping all over each other. The bathroom is TINY and the shower curtain has no lining so it leaks EVERYWHERE. E-V-E-R-Y-W-H-E-R-E. The room reminded me of being on a cruise ship - which are known to have small sized rooms. If you stay here I would recommend getting up early because you will be woken up by every sound in the curved hallway. When we arrived we were under the impression that there would be hotel parking - but it is almost funny how many spaces this hotel actually has. There are about 20 spaces in the entire parking lot. 20. Including employee parking. No wonder the lot was always full! We waited for about 2-3 days before we were able to get a space. We would call prior to parking at the designated alternative hotel (4 blocks away or so - which was about a 10 minute walk) to see if we were able to snag a spot. On our 3rd day or so when we got back the hotel receptionist was rather rude and told us ""Well I have been trying to call you all day - we have a spot for you."" which she repeated about 3 times. ""I have been calling you and calling your room and you don't answer."" Who stays in their room all day when they are in Hawaii? And why give me a hard time about it like I was putting you out? Strange. We spent the day at Hanauma Bay - so we left at about 7am and to back at 12pm - which I didn't think was that long to be out of our room anyway.Also one night we got back and the elevator had trapped someone in there - and they were frantically trying to open the stairs for us since the other elevator wouldn't come down. It seemed to really freak her (the receptionist) out the the elevator did that. When other patrons at the hotel joined us in the lobby area and asked what was going on the worker (a young gentleman who spent a large amount of time smoking outside while on his cell phone) gave them a really rude response without a real explanation. They stuck a huge laundry basket in there to prevent people from going in that elevator.Overall it as a very mediocre hotel. I honestly don't understand the reviews saying how amazing this place is. My husband thinks that they should just tear the whole place down to start over. If you are really struggling for a room and do not care about any luxuries and want to stay ON Waikiki then go for it. The friends we were traveling with got a room a block away at the Aston Beach Hotel and it was a million times nicer.","Houston, Texas","CocoRee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",50,2.0

When we arrived we informed them that we had a disabled person in our group and they informed us that they had parking on top near the outside of the hotel and that the other people parked in covered parking. We parked in this area that they directed us to and when we went out to use the rental car the next day the front winshield was shattered from a bottle that was thrown from a window of the hotel by one of the hotel guests. The Hotel staff said they knew about the incident, and had filed a report, but that the hotel was in no way liable for the damage, even though they are the ones that told me to park in this uncovered area right up next to the hotel.The car would have been safe covered, but the disabled parking is sitting right next to the 14 floors of rooms with balconies that are directly above the car spaces. The glass deductible is 500, and the replacement cost is $485.00, so I am out of pocket the entire amount for the replacement of the windshield. The hotel manager was very curt and could care less about what had happened. I had to spend the day we had planned on this once in a lifetime trip to Hawaii filing police reports, working with insurance, hotel staff and car replacement. We did not have money for this unforseen expense, and so we could not sight see to the places we had wished to see while we were there and ended up spending alot of time in the room. A trip we saved up for was ruined, we had no money now to go and do things, and the disability precluded water activities. Something we had planned to be a great one time vacation became a sad trip of lost opportunities. The hotel sent us a letter as soon as we arrived home stating they were not liable for anything and we were responsible for their guests behavior breaking the windshield of the rental car. The reports from the hotel states that it was someone from the hotel rooms above that did this, but that mattered nothing to them. I am uploading the copies of the reports from the hotel, so you can judge yourself if this is the type of hotel that you want to trust with your vacation. I would advise against this, as they care not for their guests and our trip was ruined by trusting that the car would be safe where they directed us to park.The Hotel letter said that the car was not in the care, custody or control of the hotel, and yet the report submitted by the hotel staff said it was on property and that it was in the space they told me to park in, and that it was from their window that the item was thrown.","Walla Walla, Washington","Troy J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walla Walla, Washington</strong>",69,1.0

It may be picky but I'd prefer to had these things built into the daily cost.

It was nearly 20 years since I had been to Honolulu on a 2 day stopover and everyone I spoke to, had said it had changed a lot and was a very classy and fantastic place for a holiday.I was celebrating my birthday and decided to stay at this lovely little hotel right over the road from Waikiki Beach which had been recommended to us by another friend who always stays here when she goes to Honolulu.I had an Ocean Front room 4 levels up because I don't like heights and like to be close enough to see the hussle and bussle of the street below and since I live on a noisy main street here in Sydney, I knew the noise would not bother me in Hawaii. 2 of my friends had a room next to me which was not quite ocean front but still with a great beach view and my other 2 friends had separate rooms on the 10th level with magnificent views over the ocean but way up high from the street level. They both loved their rooms. We arrived just in time for the Honolulu Festival ,therefore my room was brilliant for a fabulous view of the parade on Kalakaua Avenue and my friends on the 10th level had the best views for the fireworks display on the Saturday night. They were magic,much better than Sydney's NY's Eve fireworks.The Aston Circle is a gorgeous little place with delightful and very helpful staff, the concierge, Angel ,is exactly that, an extremely helpful, lovely man. There is no restaurant attached to the hotel but you can have breakfast at a café below called 'Eggs and Things'. Mmmmmmm we didn't try it, not to any of our taste buds, but it seemed to be popular. We ate at the utterly fabulous Moana Surfrider and The Royal Hawaiian Hotels.My room was just heaven for me, very clean and the bathroom has a good hairdryer. I have read some reviews saying that the rooms are small, but we all thought they were perfectly adequate for 2 people, I think some people must travel with all of their belongings and cram their rooms with luggage.I slept with my balcony door open half way as the weather was divine and I could hear the waves all night long, it was magic. Can't do that in Sydney without the huge cockroaches coming in!! I did have to close the sliding door in the early hours about 6am, because the traffic and general noise did start to build up.O'ahu is such a beautiful island and next time I will visit the other islands. The people are so helpful and polite, it is a pity we don't get the same level of service here in Sydney where they are much better paid. The pay is not that great in Hawaii and therefore you are expected to tip but it is a pleasure to do so. There is a side of Honolulu that is not so pleasant when you walk around near the park at Diamond Head in the early hours and see some of the poverty, it is such a shame to see and realise that not everything is as you see on Waikiki Beach.Having said that, Waikiki Beach is a gorgeous beach to relax and makes for a thoroughly magical holiday. I will definitely be going back.","Sydney, Australia","255060Victoria</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",23,5.0

Downstairs is an amazing breakfast place and probably the most popular eatery in Waikiki with line ups all hours of the day. There are hidden fees and charges / tourist taxes etc with this hotel but I think that's the same for all hotels so double check. 1 downside was the lifts - one was broken so we waited quite a while.

This was our second stay at The Circle and it did not disappoint. Location, location location! We had an ocean front room (which I recommend you book in the first place instead of hoping for an upgrade). It is directly across from Waikiki Beach. You can literally leave your room, go down the elevator, cross the street and you are on the beach in three minutes. It doesn’t get much better than that.Now the rooms are relatively small and because the hotel is a circle, the rooms are more or less wedge shaped. While our room was big enough for the two of us plus our three large suitcases, it’s not really big enough for much else. But since you’re not there to just sit in your room all day, it’s not a big deal. And the room was very neat and well cleaned. Since our last visit the room and the bathroom have been redone. I do wish they had installed a screen door going out to the lanai. I would like to be able keep that open and not run the AC. There is also now a restaurant off of the lobby area that we ate at our first morning.We had a rental car and did pay parking charges of $18 a day. I’m okay with that, as not everyone who stays there is going to have a car to park. If you use the service, you should pay for the service. Also, others have mentioned having difficulty with getting a space in the garage. Granted the garage is not huge, but we were able to get a spot each night, so no problems there.What I don’t like the fact that we had to pay a mandatory daily “amenity fee” of $15 for use of wi-fi, etc (since we didn’t need wi-fi or the other services provided). While this seems to be a trend with hotels these days to make their rates look lower (much like airline baggage fees), I don’t like paying for services that I don’t use. Yes, I knew about the charge before checking in, but that doesn’t make it right. Either raise the room price slightly so everyone knows the actual price and then offer “free wi-fi” or make it an optional charge. After all, how much does it really cost to provide a wireless signal?But all in all a wonderful stay – if we were to return to Honolulu would definitely look at The Circle first for our lodging.",Rochester NY,"Angie49</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester NY</strong>",51,4.0

Location is great. We were lucky to again have an oceanfront room on the 14th floor and the view is to die for!! Best view for your money in Waikiki.From the balcony we could see turtles swimming at the beach across the road everyday and we were even lucky enough to see some whales spouting off shore one evening.This time we had 4 adults in the room and before we arrived we were worried about how we would all fit but it was fine. There's plenty of storage in the cupboard and under the beds for suitcases (We had 8 suitcases and 4 carry on bags) and we all managed in the space we had. The room and bathroom are small but so clean and fresh and the balcony (lanai) is wonderful! Wi-fi in our room was quick and reliable. The staff are lovely and very accomodating. This is not a 5 star luxury hotel and there is no grand foyer or restaurant or pool or room service however it is in a perfect location directly across from the beach and close to lots of restaurants and shops and an easy 5 minute walk to the heart of the Waikiki shopping strip.We think the Aston Waikiki circle is a hidden gem and would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Waikiki.,"Sydney, Australia","WoniOz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",27,5.0

However, the downside is that the amenities you have to pay extra for--which in turn would make up the price of this ""affordable"" hotel. Wi-Fi mandatory charge of $15/night, as well as to park in their garage is $18/night. --Be sure to get there early (there are only 22 available spots to park in the garage--if it gets full, you have to park at another hotel down the street that they suggest) I get it that these features may be needed (b/c it is IMPOSSIBLE to park on the streets of Waikiki)-but I don't think hotel guests should be charged for parking--but I see that it is pretty popular for Waikiki hotels to do so.The rooms are small, really only big enough for 2 people. Bathroom is small too..we did have a bit of difficulty with the shower head--since it would shoot the water out beyond the shower floor and we would have to tamper to adjust it correctly--and once we did the water pressure was low.

There is a new amenity fee which most hotels now charge, annoying yes but the WiFi always worked and it was nice having the paper at the door.

Across the street at the Pacific Beach Hotel, the restaurant has an enormous salt water tank with skipjack and other ocean fish. I liked it so much I went there twice, the waitress I had was pleasant and suggested the Kona Coffee Press when I asked for strong coffee. At $12 a pot, it was not cheap but excellent and worth the splurge, made easier by the extremely reasonable rates at the Circle.

I loved having access to unlimited beach towels, free beach mats, and kids beach tubes. Also, there are free movie rentals which you can watch in your room.

When compared to the bargain rate of this hotel and what you get, we didn't mind.The staff were friendly and professional, and we loved eating at the restaurant. We kept an eye on the queue from our balcony, so when it was short we would go down and be seated quickly, unlike other diners who had long waits because the food is so amazing there. I also liked that there wasn't any lobby or resort stores to go through.

Stayed there for a week, and housekeeping did a great job of cleaning up each day.There was a $15 a day resort fee or some darn thing. I knew about it, just add it to the bill. This hotel is no different than others in that regard. Why they don't just add it in? I'm not a marketing major, so who knows. There was in room wifi for each room. Nothing great. I averaged 2-4Meg download on various tests. It was in room only tho. Tried it on the balcony/lanai and it did not work. I'm guessing the interference from all the rest wiped it out. Speaking of being on the balcony/lanai. What a great spot for views and people watching. We were in room 904 which I think was an full ocean view room. And it was, you can see up and down the shore. You can't see Diamondhead from the hotel, because the hotel is back where the shoreline dips in a bit, but it has a great view of Waikiki beach, which is just across the street.I had a great time just sitting out there and watching the people walk by. It was Christmas week, and it was crowded. Of course, just listening to the ocean added to the view. Though you won't just hear the ocean. It is kinda noisy around there. It faces a busy beachfront street. But I live out in the middle of Iowa where it is super quiet, and it didn't bother me. In fact, I slept with the lanai door wide open every night. Really the worst thing might be the garbage trucks with their beeps at 6 in the morning.As for sleeping, I thought the bed was great. Maybe it was the beautiful breezes blowing in, but I slept like a baby (the good kind of baby.)Not much interaction with the staff, but friendly when I did. Nice touch by the hotel...on Christmas they left a tree ornament in our room, and a card signed by 20 or so people, which I presume is the staff. The ornament will be a nice memento to hang on the tree for future Christmases.Only 14 floors, elevator trips were quick. I don't think I ever waited more than 30 seconds for an elevator. Had an Eggs and Things restaurant near the entrance. Lot of long lines and seemed to be popular with Japanese tourists. Went there once, I don't get the popularity. Nothing wrong with it, but you can walk right next door and get cakes and eggs from McDonalds that tastes just as good for about 1/2 the price with next to no wait.The room has a fridge, might have been nice to have a microwave, but not sure where I'd put it tho.

However I asked for a jug and tea making facilities and the hotel was happy to supply them for me. Ocean front, ocean view and partial ocean view rooms are the best. Other rooms face away from the sea. The hotel is small with two elevators which operate quickly, no waiting time as in some larger hotels.

Yes, the rooms are ""small"", and it doesn't have a pool, but the location is excellent. The rooms reminded me of a standard cabin on a cruise ship. I had room 1107 which had a view of the building to the north, but on the balcony had an excellent view of the ocean. For some reason the breakfast restaurant on the street level is incredibly busy, with a convoluted system of ordering, paying, and eating. I'm thinking someone from Toyota management designed the system. McDonald's is next door, as well as an excellent breakfast 1/2 block away, to the south. The whole thing reminded me of Japan. My only complaint was their laundry. I dropped off my laundry in the morning, and the laundry service ""was late"" and it was never done. I suggested they find a more reliable company for their laundry, and they suggested they couldn't. Really? In Honolulu? I guess that's what happens when you don't have many repeat customers who want this service. The location is excellent, you can walk out of your room in your swimsuit, take the hotel-supplied towel with you, right across the street to one of the nicest beaches you'll ever have.

What you can see is other Aston properties next door and close enough to count freckles on a tourist's nose. :-) I complained to the manager and he had no ocean front available that night but in the morning i was upgraded to ocean front for an additional $30/ night plus tax and fees. While we're on the subject of fees; this property as most on Waikiki charge ""activity fees"" approximating $17/day. Why they don't include this in their room rate is beyond comprehension.The hotel is in a great location across from the beach, walking distance to the zoo and easy walking access to shopping and dining in the area. I walked to Diamond Head in about an hour and then climbed to the peak, moderately strenuous and do it early. :-)The rooms are NY small and bathrooms are even smaller, they're clean and adequate with large screen TV but not HiDef.

In my opinion the best view rooms are those that end numbered ""04"" and the higher you get all the better, i.e. 104 is at the bottom and very noisy and there are 14 floors all up, if you can get above the 10th floor it should get a lot quieter. That said, the air conditioners are very old and noisy themselves. It looks like the hotel has had a mini makeover to freshen it up and the rooms are bright and cheerful, but they are very small and all have 2 double beds, no other combination. Personally I would hate to have more than 2 people in one of these rooms, even if you can sleep with 2 small children, what do you do with them once you get out of bed. We had trouble finding somewhere to place our suitcases for 2 people, let alone 4. The location is excellent, smack in the middle of Waikiki shops and right opposite the beach. Lots of options for dinner nearby and excellent for watching the sunset from your balcony. You can see some of the nightly entertainment from your room and the bus stop is very close by too. I thought the NON OPTIONAL AMENITY FREE of $15.71 per night a total rip off, they bundle a bunch of stuff you don't want and make you pay for it daily. If it is not optional it should just be included in the Room Tariff. The bundle included WiFi, DVD's, In room Safe, Local Calls, In room Tea/Coffee, and a daily Newspaper, stuff most hotels include anyhow, and who wants a daily newspaper? Reception staff not really interested, but the gentleman at the Tour Desk was excellent, a big thank you to him for his efforts. My favourite was the Maid for room service, who monitors how much shampoo and soap you are using and will not leave any more until she deems you cannot get another day of use out of opened stuff, was very worried on last day, wasn't sure I had enough soap for shower before my flight!

Like most other reviews said; the check in desk is in the open, the rooms are small, and it can get noisy. However, if you do your research ahead of time, you are aware of all of this.

I I was given room 504. I was very pleased as it was high enough up to enjoy a great view, but low enough on the fifth floor for good people watching in ever bustling Waikiki. Almost the entire ocean front side of the room was glass. You could literally lay in bed, and gaze at the beautiful Pacific. However, the giant blind did a good job of keeping most of the light out for sleeping. The room itself was clean and obviously recently updated in a nice bright modern island motif. The only negatives were, as others have stated, the bed is very soft. However, I did not wake up with a backache like some previous experiences with soft beds. Also, there was no option for a single King or Queen, only 2 doubles - not ideal for couples like us.

Everything is new and we enjoyed our stay here. For some reason though it was pretty windy the time we stayed there because we could hear the wind all night outside which kept us up but only on that side we were one as you couldn't hear it at the front of the building...weird. All and all, we enjoyed our stay. Bathroom is pretty small and the whole room is compact but it worked for us and we had a good stay. It felt clean and safe but it's not a luxury hotel. Pretty basic but stylish and cute. We liked it but I've since stayed at other locations since trying this out on my first stay. I'd stay again if the price was right and it's close to everything.

Just as the other reviewers said, its located directed across from the beach and in the middle of endless shopping and tasty restaurants. One thing about the beach that I haven't read anyone mention is the issue on homeless individuals hanging out in the area. Don't be alarmed they are harmless for the most part, but it's very unfortunate to see so many of them at night camped out on the beach and sidewalks.The rooms are newly renovated, but the only issue I had was the shower. The bathroom is a little small but my main issue was that the shower doesn't give you much space to really move around without touching the walls or shower curtain (ewww) because the shower head was too large for the overall shower. My husband is 6'3 and he was cramped. The shower head was so huge that the water would splash on the floor and cause a puddle to lead to the bedroom. I literally had to place towels at the edge of the shower just to keep the water from going everywhere. The overall design of the shower was not thought out properly during renovation. Other than the shower issue..the room was fine. I mentioned the issue to management and they said they would take care of it which I hope they did. I will try to upload the footage we took of the shower. The bed was average. If you need a firm bed then this hotel may not be a good choice because the bed has a soft cushion. The rooms only offer a fridge, no microwave, so don't plan on reheating any food that you may take back to the room. The balcony is really nice anytime of the day you want to catch a cool Hawaiian breeze and NOTE: you will also make new friends from neighboring vacationers from the surrounding hotels who are also hanging out on their balcony's, so you are never really alone out there. The wifi connection is slow especially for the 15 per day service charge. The staff was very attentive and polite. The hotel also offers a 10percent discount for the Eggs n Things Restaurant which is located directly on the property. The food there was okay. If you plan to park your vehicle, there is an additional 15 per day to park and spaces are limited, so plan accordingly.","Stafford, Virginia","Brittany O</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stafford, Virginia</strong>",8,3.0

It is located at the end of the 'Las Vegas Strip' of Waikiki and just a fabulous location. We arrived late on a flight from Anchorage and were given a room..ocean front..on the third floor. There were air conditioning units under the balcony that were pretty noisy. The next day, we asked if we could upgrade to a higher floor... they gave us a beautiful room on the 10th floor...facing the ocean and WOW... we are enjoying a wonderful part of Waikiki and O'ahu. Having been to the islands many times and when we are on this island, we always stay at the North End. Can't say enough about the great staff here. Rooms are very simple, but very clean and very comfortable. Balcony is wonderful... air conditioning is good. Bathrooms are small but the show heads are placed high and good water pressure. If you are given an 'Ocean View' room, it will be an excellent view.

The DVD player which is a PS2 played roughly half the movies that we tried to watch from the hotels free rental seservice. this was even after the PS2 was replaced by maintenance.

The front desk on arrival was not very polite and was quite rude. We could not get into our room, but he did offer to store our bags, but gave us no map of the local area or any suggestions on where we could have breakfast, so after a 17 hour journey we just walked and walked and eventually was so tired thought we would head back to the hotel and try and check in, yes they had a room ready. I knew that check in was not until 3pm, but had spefically emailed them prior to our arrival to ask if we could have an early check in, as we were also departing early, and was told they would try their best, this guy on front desk on our arrival did not even ask for our name, just said ""check in not until 3pm""!!!!!Our overall stay was fine and when we got to our room, after checking in, our stay was plesant. Every other staff member or front desk was quire helpful after our arrival experience. Yes the rooms are quite small, but hey Honolulu has so much to offer that it did not matter to us at all. The rooms were clean the only thing is that we had a partical ocean view room, but directly out our window we were facing into another hotel and the parking of a hotel behind, I would recommend a full ocean view room, as when we also went to sit on the balcony it was like a wind tunnel and too windy to sit out there which was a shame.Would we stay here again, possibly, location perfect!!!!!","Perth, Australia","FordyPerth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",121,4.0

For the first night we stayed in a city view room as this is what we had booked being half the price of an ocean view room. We asked for an upgrade on arrival and managed to get a full ocean view room for the second night onwards for an additional $40 a night. Much cheaper than booking one originally. I would suggest doing this but not in peak season as you may not be able to upgrade when there. On the other hand, the beach is just across the road so if you do have a city view room, a better view is only 2 minutes away.The staff were very helpful at check in and the rooms are serviced to a good standard every day - leave a tip and the service gets even better!There is a good restaurant outside which is worth queueing for if you like omelettes, pancakes and waffles.

When we first arrived, we were booked on a back facing room through Priceline, but decided to go with the upgraded ocean view for $20/day and let me tell you, it was worth it! We were on the 11th floor and the view is unobstructed!. You can sit out on your patio to watch the surfers during sunrise/sunset while eating a spam masubi! The hotel is located right across from the beach, you literally cross the street and you're there. Nothing beats being this close to the ocean and not only that but you are right in the middle of everything. The international market is a 5min walk away same with the Honolulu Zoo and if you need to ride the bus, it is right outside!Another good thing about this Hotel is that it is located right next to the Pacific Beach Hotel which is where alot of the tour companies pick you up for your island tour, cruise dinner, luau, or snorkeling adventures!There is a brand new Mcdonalds that opened up right next to the hotel, not for me personally, but I know alot of people enjoy their food and they are very affordable.As far as the room is concerned, it is fresh and is cleaned daily. The only thing that I think could be updated is the safe in the room, it was the old key safes and I was afraid that I might lose the key the entire time. Also, the bathroom pressure was REALLY low. It took me twice as long to shower because of this, but not a big deal. The staff is friendly and very knowledgeable and there is a restaurant right outside the hotel that always has a line.

All in all you get what you pay, rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Great location right on the beach with eggs and things down strairs. Make sure you get a beach view great for singles or young teens traveling not for families. We knew when we booked but there is no pool or fitness centre.

Comfortable bed and always clean room. The bathroom was a little small (but who stays in a bathroom in Waikiki!!). From the balcony, some street noise but for the location - it cannot be beaten.Service: WOW! Checked in late PM with a lovely Aloha welcome from a very friendly and helpful lady at Reception. Daily service was unobtrusive and when we did see cleaning staff, they were always so friendly, happy and smiling with an Aloha greeting every time.Facilities: Reception always friendly and attentive and very helpful. Tour desk staff helpful too. Internet access at Reception is good. 'Free' DVDs ok (paid for in amenity fee) while some didn't work (possibly an external company look after these). Eggs'n' things - an onsite café/restaurant open for breakfast through brunch and dinner. Good value if you can wait in the daily queues - a testament to how popular the place is and worth the wait for good food at reasonable prices. Staff always friendly and very helpful. If your order is for one take-out - you can jump the queue with the staff taking order on mobile and you pay at counter - much quicker! (McDonald's is opening soon too (says opening Summer 2013) - right next door!Pool: The pool was always clean, a beautiful turquoise blue with great views and is very popular - it's called Waikiki Beach!..directly opposite the Hotel...It's Awesome! :-)For: Location and such friendly and helpful staff.

Across from the outside lobby is a very decent restaurant serving mostly breakfast foods with an emphasis on the local favorites loco moco in a variety of styles. There are several bars and other restaurants very close to the hotel. So after the initial small bit of disappointment, i found the Aston Waikiki circle great for what i had in mind.

Glad I found the Circle. Location couldn't be better. I was thrilled that they allowed me to check in at 10am because there was a room ready. Staff were friendly. Room was partial ocean view. I didn't use the lanai because of limited privacy -- it faced another hotel's lanais. In fact, I had to remember to shut my curtains for privacy as the windows don't seem to be one-way. Very small room, which was perfect for me even tho it had 2 double beds. Bathroom/shower is tiny, but sufficient for one person. If my husband and kid had come, I would have gone crazy with lack of space for luggage/storage. But then again, we would spend very little time inside the room, so maybe not a big deal. Unfortunately, construction on a McDonald's is going on next door. (really?? Waikiki needs more local food, dudes!!) The construction makes it not so convenient to walk down the street. I rate the room ""average"" for sleep because the A/C unit is loud! But Waikiki is loud too, so sleeping with the door open was not an option.Oh, and the hotel has an ""Eggs n Things"" restaurant.

For staying in Waikiki the location couldn't be better though, very central and right on the beach. Speedishuttle are really good (look out for the guys in red shirts at the airport). They'll take you right to the hotel and pick you up there at a prearranged time for your return flight for about $25 per person all in. The restaurant in the hotel 'Eggs n Things' is really popular - queued out of the door in the mornings.

We booked the hotel primarily because the price was good and the location looked to be very good as well. As it turns out, the location is excellent. The hotel is located immediately across the street from Waikiki beach. The hotel itself is a bit of a unique design (hence the ""circle"" name). The rooms have apparently been updated recently. We took a city view room since we weren't planning on being in the room much besides to sleep. The view ended up being of a parking structure and the adjacent hotel/condo's hot tub. Although small, the room had good features such as a safe, mini fridge, closet and TV with PS2/DVD. One of the neat features of the hotel was the included DVD rentals - there is a machine in the lobby that guests of the hotel can check-out free movies from to watch in their rooms - very convenient if you're looking for something to do in the evening. The only real complaints about the room were that the air conditioner was fairly loud and the hotel does not seem to have rooms with king/queen beds (we had two doubles and I think all of the rooms are like that). They also have limited parking available at the hotel for a fee which we took advantage of for a few days (be warned - the lot is quite small so I would assume there might not always be spots available, although we had no trouble). Overall, we'd recommend this hotel for a traveller looking for a good deal for an excellent location.","Calgary, Canada","jdalbert</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",42,4.0

I have been to Hawaii many times over the years and have stayed at both high end and lower end hotels. Since discovering the Circle, I have stayed there my last 4 visits. Yes, the rooms are small, but really how much time are you spending in your room when paradise is outside? I definitely recommend spending the extra for an ocean view or ocean front room and ask for a higher floor. The location is ideal - the beach is literally across the street, great unobstructed ocean views from many rooms - better than many higher end hotels. The balcony is a good size and although the rooms are small, they are fine for 2 people and the space is well planned out. Yes, the bathrooms are tiny but again, no wasted space.

We have previously stayed at a high end on the beach hotel in an ocean front room – nice, & a really really nice hotel on the beach in an ocean view suite when we took the 17yo, this time it was just us so we looked for something a little cheaper as we still wanted an ocean front room, well did we hit the jackpot. Firstly because we are just over 50, you get a discount, yes!! Secondly where can you take 89 steps from your room to the sand in 4 minutes, well we could. No waiting for the lift, no huge lobby, no bar, (doesn’t matter, my other half played bartender & got those Californian Chardonnays to me from next door at the ABC Store quicker than the bartender at the Sheraton) (& 2 mini bottles for $3.50, are you kidding me?) for a drink on our 9th floor OCEAN FRONT room in the afternoon after our swim at the beach, did I mention 89 steps from the room in just 4 minutes. Didn’t need a pool either, beach across the road, amazing! Checked in with no problems, was asked if we would prefer a queen bed or 2 doubles, so jumped at the queen knowing the rooms were on the smaller side. I was a little apprehensive as our door was directly opposite the lift door, but I did not hear a thing the whole 5 days I was there. We needed a couple of extra pillows, not a problem, I had just hung up the phone & there was housekeeping at the door with them. Did I mention the view from the balcony, spectacular, did I mention the price for this view, unbeatable. Yes the room isn’t large, but there is everything you need, TV, dvd hire, wifi, bathroom amenities, room safe, coffee, refrigerator, air conditioning, which brings me to my only gripe, can you please install split systems & get rid of those noisy box aircon units, luckily it wasn’t scorching hot, so we ended up running the aircon on fan only, slept with the door open, which I closed with my foot (you are that close to it lying in bed) as the sun came us because I didn’t want any feathered friends waltzing into our room. The night before check out I asked where we could get a cab, no problem says the desk clerk, just come down when you’re ready & I’ll call one for you. There was a crowd at checkout, us & another couple, this is a crowd at this hotel, just loved it & it’s so quirky with its pie shaped rooms. We cannot fault the service with this hotel, it’s not the Ritz, but their website shows you what you get & there isn’t any false advertising, I actually feel we did very well for our money. This oceanfront room was about 1/3 of what we would pay elsewhere & we didn’t need any of the “extras”, this is Waikiki, everything is at your doorstep anyway.

We came here after a fab stay at the luxurious Westin Ka'anapali Villas in Maui, so right away it was a letdown to end up at a funky high rise motel on Waikiki. Truly that is what it is. The Good:Location-it's right across the street from Waikiki Beach, near the Duke statue, and SO CLOSE to all the fabulous shopping along the boulevard. Can't beat that.Staff-All so nice, and helpful. There is no lobby, just a counter with staff behind glass, but they were always so helpful. We had a problem with our door lock, and the housekeeper rang up the maintenance man, and it was all fixed right away. Nice!The ""Meh"":Rooms-While they were charmingly decorated in a retro look, and the bed was comfy enough, the rooms are truly small. The bathroom also was tiny. But it was all clean, so can't complain too much.Balcony-OMG, it was pretty scary to go out on that balcony. We were in #1307 (yes, 13th floor!!), so we had a decent ocean view. But going out onto the balcony made my legs weak. And the sliding door really didn't close correctly, so I was quite sure I would wake up at night and wander off the balcony and over the side. There was no screen slider, so we couldn't open the door and let breeze in. Whatev, I got over it by day two.Parking-We are ADA, so we were able to take advantage of the handicap spot near the ""lobby"", but it looked like a small parking garage was what others had to deal with. If full, there were other Astons nearby, so maybe it all works out. Not sure about that.So there you go. This is NOT a resort, and I guess the pricing is great.

We also made use of the parking, beach towels, luggage scales & discounted meals from Eggs n things, which I thought was very convenient and made our stay stress free. Lastly, I had newspapers taken, probably thrown out, which I wanted to take with me and had souvenir submarine magazines, within them. I should of packed them away but they were not located anywhere near the trash can. The staff were helpful and friendly.

The view from our room was gorgeous. Loved sitting out on the deck in the morning having a coffee and watching the sun go down at night. Truth of the matter is any hotel really along the strip in Waikiki is going to be in a great location and most likely offer you a wonderful view of the ocean and beach. If you chose to stay at one of these properties I would recommend not spending the extra money for the view and get a room facing away from the strip. Why spend the extra money when you can take the elevator down walk 100 feet and be on the beach? Reason I am suggesting this is facing the strip is very noisy. If you are a light sleeper you are going to be quite annoyed by all the street noise. More specifically with this property I was happy with the staff, they were very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very small but you get what you need and honestly when in Hawaii how much time are you spending in your room? Hopefully very little! I don't think we would stay at this property again.

We wanted to stay directly at Waikiki beach but were turned off by the chains' standard offers at exorbitant prices for an ocean front room. So we opted to take a risk, considering it was just for one night.What a pleasant surprise! We liked our ocean front room on the 11th floor and cherished sitting on the balcony and looking at Waikiki beach and the bustling activity on Kalakaua Avenue below. The building's strange circle shape, the reception behind glass (not bullet-proof, as one prior reviewer had suggested), the quirky pastell blue color scheme in the room, the small Motel 6-like window A/C (which we did not need at night), the functional small bathroom--all of this reminded us of travel in a different period, in a very positive way. We commend the owners for having preserved many of these characteristics and for having avoided a cookie-cutter modernization of the rooms akin to the thousands of chains' hotel rooms on the strip.We also found the hotel price very competitive for Waikiki. There was, of course, a resort fee of USD 15 for ""amenities"" that many guests probably won't use (like movies), and we paid USD 15 for parking below the hotel. All of this is what needs to be expected for a stay in Waikiki and it thus did not bother us. We would recommend an ocean front room, for the views; traffic noise was not an issue on the 11th floor, and the A/C noise from neighboring hotels was far enough away that it did not spoil our marveling at the view.So pick the Aston Circle if you enjoy--like we did--reliving some of the 1960s/1970s feeling.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","SGECHAMPION</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",161,4.0

In total, I had the opportunity to get a close up look at 6 different rooms (3 of mine and 3 of my colleagues) which made for a higher than average sample of the accommodations. Of the 6 rooms, there was not one that was quiet enough to enjoy the balcony. The lower floors are overwhelmed with street noise, and the upper ones are overwhelmed by the noise from the room's air conditioner exhaust vent and/or the industrial air vents from the surrounding hotels, which have grown up around the Aston over the last 50 years. Inside the rooms, the air conditioners are vintage low-budget models of the cheap motel variety. This made sleep nearly impossible - turn them off and the humidity was unbearable, turn them on and you're sleeping next to jet engine.The reception area is a vaguely delineated open space in which you are crowded by the never-ending lineup for the Eggs 'n Things restaurant (see below). The staff at reception are pleasant enough, but it is difficult to hear them through the glass, much like when you are trying to get information from a ticket agent in a city subway. In addition to being annoying, it makes any hope of private conversation with the staff impossible. I was told it was because their area behind the glass was air conditioned, but it certainly leaves one with the feeling you are in a rather unsavory neighborhood. The Eggs n' things Restaurant has a perennial lineup of Japanese tourists (apparently it is featured in some popular tourist brochure there); in addition to adding to the noise and unwanted bustle of the hotel, makes it impossible to walk down and get a quick bite to eat.The hotel was probably something to behold in its heyday back in the 1950's but it is well past it's best before.

From a British point of view (party of four adults), we have travelled half way round the world to be in Hawaii, we want to see what it has to offer. Eating out prices are what you want them to be but always much cheaper than UK equivalents. Hawaiian market area gets you some good value.The Hotel... is functional with no frills, but as with most holidays to the US from the UK are room only, that is what you get a room. The hotel has no bar or restaurant, but there are plenty of bars and restaurants in the surrounding area. The Rooms... Some doubles some twin queens (our party had one of each) The rooms are not the largest I have ever been in and nor are they the smallest. There is adequate space for two adults and there holiday luggage (3 weeks worth in our case). The rooms are ok to relax in with TV but are not suites, but then why do you want one, your on Oahu how long do you want to spend in your room ? A note of caution, Sea Facing rooms have a view to die for, beware of rear facing rooms with the bin store and view of a car park.The Staff, the only staff you will come into contact with are the knowledgeable reception staff and possibly the very efficient cleaning staff. As the hotel does not have any other services it does not need them. The Extras, there is a store where left behind beach toys (boards etc) are available from. IF you are just ""playing"" on the beach then it saves purchasing.The Location... Slap bang opposite Waikiki beach. Close to everything Honolulu has to offer. Restaurants and bars galore. No need for a car here, public transport to Pearl Harbour is easy, but guided tours are available close by. Recommend Dukes and Cheesecake factory to eat or Cheeseburger in paradise (turn left out of hotel, 1 block down) or Dennys are good for breakfast. Coffee from ABC stores or McDonalds, all within 25 yards of hotel.This is not a luxury hotel, but it was good enough to say it is functional, If we had gone to a more up market hotel I do not think we would have got value from the hotel as we would not have been in the place enough to get it.

The rooms are smallish but not overly so , and they have all you need ;fridge ,safe , tv ,closet, coffee-maker etc. Any qualms about the room however are completely nullified by the location and view from the balcony. We stayed in room 305 [only the '05' rooms are fully water frontage] and , whilst a little miffed we did'nt get a higher floor as we booked 7 months in advance , virtually ALL our time in the room was spent soaking in the rays and the view.My only real negatives about the hotel is the daily $10 Vegas style 'resort fee' that is charged that covers things like Playstation , DVD rentals and such - things that are fine for a family but un-used and un-touched by your typical couple - it just seemed like a blatant money grab. Also the shower is tiny and if you don't be precisely careful how you arrange the shower curtain - you will end up water all over the bathroom floor.If price is a concern yet you still want LOCATION and OCEAN-FRONT views then you will un-likely find any better than the Aston Waikiki Circle and we will almost certainly [barring a lottery win] stay here on our next trip.","Sydney, Australia","John T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",15,4.0

This hotel is right in the middle of the action, we found the location to be perfect as most tourist attractions pick up at the corner right next door. The reception desk is a drive thru window style setup right before the elevator. The room had an awkward layout, no doubt due to the circular design of the building. They don't offer single bed rooms, so we had a double bed room which made the room feel cramped as walking space was limited. The bathroom was small and the shower doesn't give you hardly any room to move. They do have a refrigerator in the room as well as a desk and closet area. There is a TV and PS2 gaming system which can be used to play the games or DVDs which can be checked out at the reception desk. WiFi is a little spotty, but free none the less. They do not have microwaves in the rooms, this was something that I didn't expect. I have never had to look at the amenities listed on a hotel website to verify that a microwave is available, but I will start now... Since there was no microwave you had to basically eat out every meal or eat chilled products. The halls and elevators are not climate controlled and seem musky and hot at all times.Summary:Decent price for a decent hotel. Read through the hotel website and make sure that they have all the things you want. We were disappointed to find no microwave, but checked the website to find that was our fault as one was not listed. Location is good, but rooms are small and provide an awkward layout. The beds were average as well, they weren't the worst beds, but they weren't bad either. Housekeeping is incredible, they come by at all hours of the day to clean, if you end up sleeping until 2pm, that is fine, just drop the door hanger out that says cleaning needed whenever you go out and they normally will have finished within an hour or two.","Tyler, TX","kwandrews7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tyler, TX</strong>",25,3.0

I really not sure why what I experienced makes me feel that this place barely rates an average when so many seem to like it. When I priced it for our time frame it was averaging $145 a night for a city view and about $180 for an ocean view. May others got such a great deal that this place was okay.Pros: Great Location. Yes it is a noisy busy tourisy part of Waikiki but it is nice to walk out and just be where all the action is in the am or evening.Very nice staff and housekeeping. Reception does remind you of a drive thru window but the folks are nice and helpful.Cons: Rooms are very small. The city view room I had looked over the air conditioners and faced the hotel behind me. You felt you had to keep your curtains closed and that made the room very dark as the lights are not bright. Granted, it is a circle hotel so that wedge room doesn't allow much room for walking.Pros: Saving grace on this small room is there is this tiny little L shape at the end where there is a desk so you can set up your computer. If you can use cable plug for your computer, it is free.Cons: Noisy area and the wind was something else the two days there. My breeze door literally rattled so much at night I was afraid it would fall off! Even if you didn't want the air conditioner on, you had to have it on to drown out the noise.I can handle small bathrooms, no problem. But the tub would not hold water and I bathe the kids in my room sometimes and we had to stuff wash clothes around the drain to hold water.I rate it average because of the location. Bed comfort is okay but pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable but then I have a thing for needing decent pillows. For a lot of folks this is minor.I am coming back to Honolulu with my husband in February and when trying to find a budget but decent hotel, when this one would come up on the sites, the price was usually around $145 and to be honest, not worth it to me.

When i initially got to the hotel i freaked out a little bit because the hotel ""lobby"" is nothing more than a desk enclosed with security screening in an otherwise open/outdoor area. We arrived early and they gave us the option of taking a room on the third floor, or come back later and go on the tenth (both city view). We chose the latter based on trip advisor views, and we were glad about this decision. We stayed for two weeks and during this time we found the staff lovely and extremely accommodating, especially given we were probably a little bit noisier than the older couples that make up their usual clientele. Of particular mention is our maid, and also the night watchman (an iranian man). Sorry i cannot remember either of your names!In terms of the room i loved the colourful atmosphere and compared to other hotels ""standard rooms"" I found the room to be quite reasonably sized, and my friend and i were never pressed for room. I can see how it might be difficult though if you had more than one child, or anyone older than pre-school age.The only downside of the hotel is probably the size of the shower and the low water pressure. The air conditioner i found to be not too noisy, and it was incredibly efficient meaning we rarely had to have it on. As for the lack of the lobby/porter/pool: you get what you pay for. Don't expect such luxuries for such a cheap price (it cost us $1800 for two weeks). Besides, with the beach literally across the road you don't need a pool.I have also stayed with my family at the sheraton princess kaiulani before, and i can assure you these rooms were a lot nicer and cleaner, beds a lot more comfy, and the air-conditioning a lot more efficient.Would i go back to the circle again?

True, the room was small but you are out for most of the day either at the beach or doing some other activity at another part of the island. It was clean and that was a big plus for me.

A few times the crashing sound of the garbage truck would wake me up. Our toilet backed up 3 times for no apparent reason. Each time they would quickly fix the issue. The shower was very small and designed in a odd shape. This made showing the children annoying.

Cup and a sock strewn outside.as for the bathroom 2people can't be in it at the same time you have to do the shimmy if there was 2of you in there it's soooo small,the shower box is so small it's roughly the same width as the toilet in a aeroplane or I couldn't even stretch my arms out to my side it's that pokey,this room is so small personally myself its only good for a couple not a family,i did ask if I could get a refund at reception so we could move on but it would of been a lengthy process....staff were friendly even the lady working behind the activities counter who was using a handheld mirror and tweezers To pluck her eyebrows when I was there to purchase tickets was very helpful......just saying...so to ask if I'd return to this hotel ....no I will not return.","Brisbane, Australia","busyl742</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",33,3.0

Our experience started badly when we were told that our reservation was for two days earlier. I showed the clerk the receipt from Hotwire on my phone (w/ today's date), however this wasn't accepted. I placed a call to Hotwire and the hotel reluctantly acknowledged the reservation. The rooms, beds and bathrooms are small. There are small balconies and a large sliding glass door, but there isn't any privacy because of so many adjacent condos and hotels. The rooms were clean and included the basics. Service wasn't that great. For example, I phoned the front desk to ask for the Internet password and was told I had to come downstairs to get it. There is a lot of noise around this hotel. You will pay a ""resort fee"" to stay here, in addition to the room charges and taxes. When I asked about this, I was told it covered things like Internet.

The Aston Waikiki Circle’s location certainly did not disappoint and the bustle of the city was a welcome contrast to the natural beauty and unpopulated charms of Kauai.Located directly opposite the world famous beach, the location is spot on and it’s an easy walk along Kalakaua Avenue or a block back to Kuhio Avenue for all of the shops, bars and restaurants you could ever need.We utilised the parking lot underneath the hotel for half of our stay and it was priced reasonably compared to other parking in Waikiki and a welcome and convenient option for guests with a car.The hotel is a quirky building, as the name suggests it is circular in shape with the rooms spread out in a fan formation from the central elevator shaft. Our room was comfortable and well equipped, the house-keeping staff were polite and did a great job of keeping the hotel and our room in good shape.We were unlucky with our room, it was on the first floor and at the rear of the building, located just above the rear entry and garbage area for the restaurant ‘Eggs N’ Things’ located below the hotel. It could get a little noisy because of this but it wasn’t overly intrusive and i’d imagine due to the layout it would be one of very few rooms in the hotel that had any such inconveniences. If you’re choosing your room, i’d certainly recommend going for a higher floor even if you don’t pay the extra for a full ocean view.The only real issue we had was the $10 a day compulsory resort fee, an unfortunate additional ‘tax’ on what is otherwise a well priced hotel - For this you get wifi, a daily paper and dvd rental, none of which were of any real interest to ourselves. Whilst I realise a lot of people cannot live without wifi, for us a vacation to a paradise like Hawaii is a nice excuse to escape the constant connectivity of life at home so it would have been nice not to have been forced to pay for this along with the unused dvd rental and daily paper.As mentioned the restaurant Eggs N’ Things is just below the hotel at street level and you’re entitled to 10% off as a guest of the Circle. There are often queues for this famous diner down the boulevard and I would certainly recommend it for cheap and decent quality food. The menu has Hawaiian favourites such as Loco Moco as well as Omelettes of all varieties and plenty of other options. Well worth a look. To summarise, if you’re looking for a well priced and quirky hotel with a beach front location right in the heart of Waikiki then the Circle really is an excellent option.",United Kingdom,"Andrew H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",12,4.0

Felt like I was Judy Jetson and had been transformed back to my childhood. We were only in HNL for 3 nights after a week in Maui and knew that we wanted an oceanfront, so it was well worth the splurge. We were all the way top floor, direct oceanfront, absoluely fantastic views. Front desk very friendly, maid service, prompt, efficient and good. Loved the fact that even though a small bathroom, that someone had the forethought to provide 3 good, really sturdy hooks in the bathroom. We have stayed next door in the large beach tower condo complex and that is great for a long stay if you want a full kitchen, etc. But the location, pricing of this hotel cannot be beat. I was hesitant initially with some of the reviews I read, but don't be this place is adorable and I have travelled all over the world. It was a fun and convenient place to stay.

She used a walker (liken to size of kids stroller)..sometimes it was a challenge to dance around it..but I have to say everything in the room is placed so it all can fit. The closet is very room for luggage storage. The safe is old fashioned with a lock and key. Paper at your door each day...although I did not read it. I wasn't able to get the free wifi to work on any of my devices. The front desk staff gave me a number of the internet provider. I didn't take the time to check into it. As all the other reviews state..the desk staff was very very helpful and polite. The lobby was a little different in that it was open air..and seemed more of a ""ticket booth"" atmosphere when you approach. There is a computer kiosk in the ""lobby"" that you can use for a fee, however it is free to print your boarding pass for flights out.I had read in the reviews how small the rooms and bathroom were..so was prepared for the size of shower. Biggest complaint was the cloth shower curtain was not long enough and if I didn't make sure the bathmat was placed right against the shower stall edge..it would flood the bathroom floor. Water temp and pressure was good, towels plentiful. When I requested additional face cloths the first night, maid remember to bring each day there. We rented a car and parked just one night. It was an additional $15 fee. Parking very tight..had to have help in backing out with a ""spotter"". When we first arrived we were placed only on the fifth floor with a partial ocean view (what we reserved)..not caring to look at McDonald's room..we upgraded to ocean view..and got room 1005..it was fantastic! Many reviews indicate that the air conditioning was noisey..I didn't notice. I also didn't notice the noise from the restaurant (which was always busy). I DID notice the traffic noise..ambulances ect. Beds were a little on soft side, linens were clean, new, plentiful and three pillows offered for each bed. Two elevators serviced the whole hotel..and we never had to wait long. I did see the bin that offered free use of beach toys (blow up rings..floats..ect) but did not utilize this..also I didn't utilize the free beach towels. No vending machines in the hotel..ice is retrieved from the front desk. Note to those with mobility issues. There are about 15 steps to climb from street level to get to lobby area. A sloping driveway is available..but feels kind of steep after a day of walking and sight seeing. there is a Mobility lift on the stairway, however my mom never used it.The convenience to everything in the immediate area is fabulous!

If you're looking for huge fancy rooms where you will spend a lot of time, going just to Waikiki with one day trip to Pearl Harbor I think you will go somewhere else. We on the other hand wanted to take the car and travel around the island as much as possible returning to our room just for sleep and in the end spend 2 days on Waikiki beach before flying over to Kauai. For this purpose, the hotel is just perfect and the thing is, you'll pay about as much for oceanfront here as you would pay in most of the other hotels in Waikiki for city view at best. And the experience of sitting on your lanai and watching the sun set over the ocean with absolutely nothing to block your view is just unforgettable. Another plus is, that unlike many other hotels, this one is really right on the beach, just across the street.The size of the rooms seems to be an issue in many reviews here. Honestly, I think the rooms are exactly what you need for 2 people, but I wouldn't recommend it for a family with kids. The rooms are newly renovated, they're really nice looking and clean. Just look at the pictures.Now some downgrades. If you're going to rent a car, the parking is pricey everywhere in Waikiki. The hotel charges you 15 bucks/day which is approximately the average rate around. However the parking lot, which is beneath the hotel is incredibly small. It's full all the time and I strongly recommend you to reserve your parking in advance. If they're out of parking spaces they'll send you to a hotel nearby, where the rate is 10 bucks/day but it's some 10 minutes walk from this place.Another thing is the amenity fee. When you book your room, they would show you the rate per day and total for your stay including all taxes. There is just one little note, that there is 10 dollars/night amenity fee (for safe deposit box, daily newspapers free DVD rental etc.). I thought OK, it is just an option which I would decline, I'm only gonna need the safe for which I will pay extra. What a mistake!! The fee is mandatory. I wouldn't mind it at all but I think it's a dirty trick to present you some rate and then it shows up that it's actually another 10 bucks/night extra. Why don't just add it up to the rate in the beginning?To sum it up, yes, I would definitely go back again, now knowing exactly what to expect. And a little advice, ask for the room on the highest floor possible, the views of the Waikiki are just spectacular!!!","Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic","Traveler187</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic</strong>",38,4.0

Waikiki Beach is just across the road with safe bathing areas and surfing. The rooms weren't the biggest, but more than adequate, clean, well furnished and looking recently decorated. We were in 803 and the view from the balcony was great. If you like tea, then take your own teabags - the hotel didn't have any other to offer than a few Earl Grey tea bags in reception.

We took room 306 and though we were at the tree line, the view was still pretty darn good.This hotel is more like a seaside motel with a casual flair for independent travelers. You won't get any pampering or find the usual amenities, but you will get a very clean room, friendly service from the desk, and a spectacular location for views and access to the beach, restaurants, tours, shopping etc. at a fantastic rate. They have a rack to store surf boards at no charge, my son rented a board for 3 days for $50 total from Koa Board Sports (a block away). You can take the bus anywhere from a block up on Kuhio, where you will also find a number of restaurants at a little better prices and smaller if any lineups, especially for breakfast i.e. Denny's, Ihop. I don't know why people complain about the $10 per night amenity fee. It has to be billed separately because it does not fall under the category of ""accommodation"", so what's the difference if you have two lines on your bill? it's better than having 20 lines like you do with hotels that charge for each local call & movie, safe rental etc. These extras fall under the category of ""incidentals"", like any other business there are charged categories.Other than the a/c being a bit loud (we had ear plugs), we were perfectly happy at this hotel and sitting out on our Lanai in the morning for coffee and watching the early surfers outside was definitely worth the trade off for what a higher scale property could offer inside the room.","Victoria, Canada","Vansportsfan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",183,5.0

But with the Pacific ocean across the road who cares. It doesnt have a fancy restaruant but it does have Eggs and things. Why? who knows did not get near it for the line. As it is a round hotel there are different rooms for different rates. We had a city view room which as it implies faces away from the ocean. Still a partial ocean view though. Further around to the front is Partial ocean view. More ocean than city. Than around from that is Ocean view where a member of our party stayed for the extra money. The view is very good. He was on the airport side so had a great sunset view from his 13th floor balcony. Than there is the full ocean front. Facing straight onto the ocean. Only one of these on each floor. The rooms are not big but do have 2 very comforable double beds in them. Small bathroom but clean and efficent. The A/C is old but worked great. The staff i thought were great.

Overall the hotel suited us ideally and gave us what we were looking for which was a clean and comfortable no frills hotel in a GREAT location. Having stayed in Waikiki the previous year at the property next door, we kind of knew what we were getting and it did not disappoint. Staying at this hotel is almost like staying at a rented condo (minus the maid service) because there are no amenities as such and you won't find a staff member unless you go looking for one. This may not be everyone's cup of tea but it suited us fine. The Hotel is located on Kalakaua Ave and is directly across the road from Kuhio Beach. This part of Waikiki beach is split into walled sections, creating in effect 3 large saltwater swimming pools. In terms of location it is perfect. Up nearer the end of the strip beside the zoo but close enough to all the busier bars, shops etc with out them being in your face. We stayed in room 1307 which was an ocean view room. Nice view out to the ocean and down Kalakaua if a little side on. (not diamond head) If booking be aware that ocean view is not ocean front and so if you want that panoramic 360 view, stump up for ocean front. Air Con was older, noisy but worked well, Lanai was spacious, bathroom was small but clean and shower was a little cramped for me.The only 2 real negatives would be: 1. each room has 2 double beds instead of a king/queen. I assume the reason for this is so a family of four can theoretically stay together. I think personally the room is way too small for anything more than 2 adults and there is no way I would be sharing the room with 3 other people, even if they were kids. Perhaps a mix of configurations would give greater flexability and allow those travelling as a couple to have a bigger bed and more floor space.2. This did not effect us as we were on a higher floor but bare this in mind: They have recently opened an Eggs n Things breakfast/brunch place in the lobby area. For those not familiar, Eggs n Things is super popular (esp with the Japansese folks) and there is literally a line/queue from 7am unitl the early afternoon. Now as I said, on the 13th floor this was no big deal for us but if you were placed in a room lower down you would be subjected to the noise and smells from the restaurant all day long. (Hvaing tried it, I have no idea what the fuss is about)All in all, the Circle is a great choice if you want no frills, clean accomodation in a beachfront location and despite not being anything special, the location itself would bring me back if I should visit Waikiki again","Glasgow, United Kingdom","roeboy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Glasgow, United Kingdom</strong>",136,4.0

Originally made reservations online but then had to change dates via phone and the customer service guy was very nice. I asked about the difference between Oceanfront and Oceanview, as there was a price difference, and he said Oceanview would be fine-he was right, see the pic. Our rate was $159 per night for Sat and Sunday. There is no room service, and the in house restaurant is Eggs n Things- inexplicable line out the door all the time- I am sorry, but there is no way I am waiting in line for a hour for a $14 omelet or a waffle topped with canned whipped cream unless David Beckham is serving it with his shirt off. Pluses: Location! Right across the street from the beach for this price is unbeatable. Clean room, decorated nicely. Beautiful view from 805. Coffee maker, old-school safe with key, world's fastest elevator, lanai, mini-frig for half-n-half and snacks, thick walls- did not hear a peep from neighbors or elevator. The usual flatscreen we never turned on. Minuses: I am ok with there being two double beds, but not with both of them being the softest, most uncomfortable things I have ever slept on. If we had stayed more than two nights I would have had to sleep on the $2.99 water floaty mattress from the ABC store. If you have a bad back, beware. Even my husband, who can sleep anywhere, was hurting. Also, Waikiki is noisy. This is not the fault of the hotel but just be aware that you are in a city and you will hear a lot of street noise until the wee hours when you will finally hear the waves. I mean 3 am. The shower is the tiniest thing I have ever been in. About 2 x 3--maybe. Or 20 inches by 30. Constantly worried about losing safe key. $15 parking in tiniest garage (don't rent the full size sedan!) and $10 amenities fee- for wireless and safe, I guess. Bottom line- if you are on a budget and have a good strong back, this is the perfect place.

For starters the location right across from the beach is great and the price compared to others with similar locations is unbeatable. Check in was alright (not the hotels fault – we had an early arrival so no rooms ready), but they got us in as soon as possible which was appreciated.Our room had amazing views, I highly recommend requesting a high level. We booked an ocean view room and it was worth it! Our room looked right down the beach to diamond head. The room was small in size but fine for 2 people (any more might get squishy). The bathroom is really small!! But it’s a small sacrifice to make for the location. Everything in the room worked fine – TV, safe, WiFi, fridge etc. The only 2 minor complaints we had was lighting (there really does need to be a main light in the room as it gets quite dark at night) and the AC is quite noisy during the night and woke us a fair few times. The room was always cleaned immaculately and the maid was one of the most fantastic people we dealt with on our trip (level 13). She was always so happy and accommodating and always offering us extra towels etc on days we didn’t get our room serviced. All the staff were great though we wouldn’t have a single complaint! They were always happy and friendly  The only restaurant is Eggs n Things at the bottom of the hotel. We didn’t eat there as the line was always ridiculously long. There are plenty of choices really close by so there is no problems getting food. We booked a few tours through the tour desk as well and the ladies there were really helpful and a pleasure to deal with.The $10 daily resort fee gets newspaper, internet, beach towels, and dvd rentals. I don’t really understand these – I’d rather the nightly rate go up personally, but it seems to be a common thing in Waikiki (and possibly the US??).Overall I would highly recommend the Circle (and already have!).

Hands down. EVER EVER EVER! Let me preface this by saying we stayed here in October of 2010 so things MAY have improved- I really hope they have. The circle hotel has a prime location- but when we stayed there- the photos of their hotel rooms online were not actually of their hotel. The pictures appeared to be of modest rooms, so we thought we'd try and save a few bucks. BAD IDEA!!! Upon checking into the dump of a hotel, we were shocked at how tacky and dirty the rooms were. When I called the front desk out on their photos online, they pointed to a brochure on the desk of the SAME photos, explaining that the rooms will look like that in the next couple of years when remodeling is complete. WHAT THE HECK? Deceitful marketing at the very least. We ""upgraded"" our rooms to an ocean view (which was really nice looking OUT), they charged us an additional $25 or so per night. I can't tell you how uncooperative the staff was and how grossly misrepresented the hotel was online. Honestly- the way it was back then was a hostel not a hotel. That would be an accurate feel for the room.","Corona del Mar, California","rachelynn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Corona del Mar, California</strong>",40,1.0

I booked it after doing some research and discovering the incredible room views/hotel location at very reasonable prices. We booked and I'm so happy we did. The Waikiki Circle Hotel is very cute and beachy in a fantastic location. It's right across from Waikiki beach and close to many stores and restaurants. The lobby is an open air concept which we both found fun and inviting. All our interactions with the front desk were positive. They were all very helpful and friendly. We booked an ocean front room. Thanks to the tips of fellow reviewers on here, I requested a higher floor and a queen sized bed (instead of the doubles). I honestly didn't think we would get it but we did. We were put on the 12th floor and were given the queen bed. The room was exceptionally clean and modern. It's not too big but how much space do you really need? The view was simply incredible. We had the most beautiful ocean view. Every night, we witnessed the most spectacular sunsets right on our balcony. We were both very satisfied with our stay here. The only thing we don't really get is the $10 a day resort fee. I know almost all the hotels charge it. There wasn't really anything extra we were given besides free movie rentals, but the popular ones are always out anyway. I'm not putting this on the Circle Hotel. I just don't get this fee in general. Otherwise, great stay! We'll be back.","Victoria, Canada","Krista D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",17,5.0

My granddaughter (18) and I stayed at the Waikiki Circle in June to celebrate her graduation. I chose it because of the reviews in Trip Advisor and also because we were on a fairly tight budget. I will echo all the wonderful things said by other reviewers. The location could not be beat, especially at the price we paid. Yes, it is a little noisy, but what do you expect in the middle of Waikiki? I have been there a few times before, and prefer the slower pace of Maui. But this was a first for my granddaughter, and she loved being in the middle of everything. While the rooms are not spacious, they are very adequate, especially when you don't spend much time there. The staff were friendly and even supplied us with a city bus schedule so we could travel on our own to Pearl Harbor (very easy & cheap!). We also appreciated the availability of beach chairs, umbrellas, etc. Just grab what you need, walk across the street, and there you are at the beach. I have to say that I was not too impressed with the restaurant in the building, Eggs n Things. It took a long time to get a seat and the food wasn't much to write home about. I would rather walk a block to Cheeseburger in Paradise, a much better breakfast.

I was a by myself so my criteria for a good hotel is pretty simple. Has to be clean and must be able to get a good night sleep which means comfortable bed and no noise. I had a partial beach view on the second floor. As for clean, it was pretty good. The room was pretty nice. Did not find dust or cobwebs. As for getting a good night sleep, for being right on the street of waikiki it was pretty quiet. Every now and then there would be a car that would need to use their horn. More noise was noticed inside the hotel when people would be talking loud passing my room to get to the elevator. So overall for me i gave this a 4 star.Now some of the nuances of this hotel. It is in a shape of a circle so my room was in a shape of a trapezoid as well as the bathroom. I would say the room would comfortably fit 2-3 people but no more. The bathroom is quite small. My elbows could touch one side to the other side of the wall in the shower when i was washing my hair. There is a balcony in each room it seemed. My room's balcony door did not actually lock. They had it different lock welded on. There is a $10 amenity fee which it seems most places charge some kind of amenity fee. So what you get with this fee; You have a playstation 2 in your hotel room which you can rent a movie or game to play for free on the first level. The only place you can get ice it at the front desk. You get beach towels at the front desk too. There is also boogie boards, beach mats and inflatable inner tubes at a first come first serve basis to use. They also have a place to store surfboard if you bring in your own, i don't know if they charge for that or not though. You get your own personal internet access which the fee covers. Also coffee maker in your room and newspaper delivered to the front of your door. There is a safe with a key. You get a mini fridge. There is a charge for parking which is $15 currently. But parking is very limited. I would say they had about 15 parking spots max. They were able to have others park at a partner hotel but it look like it was a few blocks away. I was able to get a spot so i don't know the details. You also get 10% off if you eat at Eggs n Things. I never ate there but there was always a line for breakfast/lunch, but it is also a pretty small place too.

The front desk is behind a piece of glass and I first thought I was in the wrong area. Check in was fast and friendly however and we were in our room in no time. The room (and bathroom) is small and the air conditioner noisy but you soon get used to it. I don't know what other reviewers were talking about but we certainly had wi-fi in our room (as will as a wired connection).When we woke up in the morning and opened the curtains the beautiful unimpeded view of Waikiki beach lay in front of us. It was simply amazing! It more than makes up for the small room. You feel like you are at the beach without having to fight over a piece of sand!The room is clean and tidy and to be honest is all you need. If you want a big room stay somewhere else but be prepared to pay significantly more if you want a similar view.Location wise the hotel is directly across the road from the beach, has shops around it and is a short walk from everything in Waikiki.

I chose the hotel primarily due to its location as I wanted to have shopping, the beach and restaurants nearby. After reading several reviews, I opted for an oceanfront room instead of the less expensive room options. This turned out to be the highlight of my stay.In terms of overall impressions, this hotel is not the gold standard in Waikiki. The rooms are small, sparse on amenities and showing their age. The front desk sits behind a glass barrier, the parking is limited (but dirt cheap) and the only onsite restaurant has waiting lines all hours of operation. Yet despite all these issues, I would still recommend it to travelers. It is all about its excellent location and manageable size. Too many hotels in Waikiki are massive complexes placed well away from the main streets and have no self-parking options. At the Aston Circle I was able to easily come and go as I wanted without waiting for, and going bankrupt over, valet parking. But it was the view from the room that memorized me time and time again during my stay. Yes, sell the silverware and go for the oceanfront room. There are few room choices in Waikiki at this price that give you so much to see right in front of you. Almost like box seats at a concert. Remember, though, this is Waikiki and it is “on” almost around the clock so it can be noisy. Even early in the morning with delivery trucks. For single travelers, couples and small families who want to be close to everything and have minimal needs from the room, this is a good choice. I doubt I would have bothered to write a review if I hadn’t chosen the room type I did. I am avoiding making details comments about the WIFI (it works), the staff I encountered (everyone is friendly and helpful) and so on. I just can’t get the memory of the view from the room out of my head.

We booked the hotel due to the proximity to the beach and the great rates. There was a minor hiccup as my boyfriend arrived prior to my family and I. He apparently was not on the reservation, but the hotel was really good about it and called me at home and confirmed he was supposed to be there. After that call, all was cleared up. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and cutely decorated. We got our goldfish! I was happy to see it as we had read about it in the reviews. My only 'beef' so to speak with the rooms is that they are all two double bed rooms. I would have preferred a queen or king, but we made it work. Also, the shower is only a stall. There is no tub. But that was fine for our needs. We did have an issue with our phone however when we notified the front desk staff they promptly sent someone up to deal with it. The same when we had a problem with our shower, though the cleaning staff fixed it before we could notify anyone. The hotel couldn't be more perfectly located. Directly across the street from the beach and near to lots of tasty restaurants and shopping. We didn't use 'The Bus' this time round. However, there are many stops around Waikiki that are easily accessible. We did get a parking spot with no problems for our 3 day car rental. Something else I really liked about the hotel is that there is a faucet just on the edge of the open lobby so you can wash your sandy feet/toys before heading up to your room. We spent a great deal of time sitting out on our lanai at night and thoroughly enjoyed that. Because we were on the 13th floor the wind whipped around the building pretty good on the windier days.

The rooms were really really small for a family of 4 but if you are organized you can get away with it. The location is awesome (just across from Waikiki beach) and the parking was great. Parking cost $15 a night (cheap for Waikiki) and you get a remote for the garage gate (arm) that you open to get in. This allowed for an easy in and out every day when we did our sightseeing without having to worry about the garage being full when we got back which was fantastic. We had a partial ocean view which meant we could sit out on the balcony which was a decent size and look out on waikiki beach. The balcony was big enough for a couple of chairs and a small table so we ate a few dinners (picked up form the International Market Place) there looking at the water and night life. We had 8 nights at the Circle then 3 nights at the Aulani and to be honest, I am glad we stayed there before the Aulani because it would be hard to adjust to the small room but it really worked out well as we had not planned on being in the room that much.

We had booked a city view room but on arrival (late at night) we found we had been upgraded to a partial view room. This gave us a side view of the beach from our balcony which was very nice. Our only problem was the noise that was coming from an air conditioning unit on the roof of the building next to us and even with the sliding door closed was still annoying and a little loud. The staff were welcoming and helpful, and the location was directly opposite the beach. Easy to walk to a number of different attractions from here, such as the zoo. The trolley buses stop nearby, and these will take you on to many other sites around town. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this hotel.","Brisbane, Australia","JulieMc13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",22,4.0

The service from the front desk was A1 throughout our stay - nothing was too much trouble although the lady in the information kiosk seemed to get ignored probably because she was tucked away behind the lifts. The number one reason for staying at the Circle is the fabulous location - you've read it all before - beach and lagoon swimming literally across the road, surfing and sailing just beyond, trolley and bus stop across from Hotel, convenience stores steps away, McDonalds and free wi-fi 'next door. The Hotel itself now includes an amenity fee of US$10 daily to cover the safe, a sachet of coffee daily, newspaper, wired internet, and refrigerator. Also a Sony PSP, DVD player with PS games and DVD's from foyer kiosk. Oh and free use of beach towels and beach toys.We loved the renovated rooms and its quirky shape - yep it was small and cosy but not so different to the tiny rooms offered to tourists in Europe. It was super clean with plenty of towels, crisp sheets and flat screen TV. The alcove with wardrobe, desk, refrigerator offered a separate space to read, email etc which made it feel bigger than it was - but what a view - sitting out on the balcony really made our room feel huge!Our days were busy so we always slept soundly. AC noise was never a problem from other rooms, and there was very little if any traffic after midnight. Even the close location of the floor lifts did not disturb us. The only 'noise' was from the ocean waves!We tried the 'eggs n things' restaurant only once because there were so many other places to try breakfast - but it was amazing how people would line up for an hour just for an omelette.We paid US$207 all up (incl taxes etc) per night which was on the high side - we booked via the Aston hotel site 6 weeks prior. Compared to other hotels offering the same stunning views the Circle Hotel gave the best value.We would stay again.","Tauranga, New Zealand","baliliz_12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tauranga, New Zealand</strong>",6,5.0

We were in room 908, a partial ocean view. Positives:Location, short walk to International Market, across from beach, trolley stop just across the road. Clean, room was spotless. Neutral:2 double beds, which we were well aware of when we booked.Room size, again we knew what we were getting when we booked. But I don't know how you would fit a family of 4 in these rooms! Negatives:NOISE! Every morning at 4am we were woken up by the thud, thud, thud of the newspapers being dropped at each door. Then as we were next to the fire stairs we endured the BANG of the door being left to slam behind the paper deliverer. If you stay here, please respect other guests and close your door gently!!Eggs and things.......now I am pregnant so maybe its just me, but the smell of eggs in the lobby is not pleasant! But there was always a queue so maybe it tastes better than it smells! Tour desk lady was not interested and really not very helpful. So don't expect much from her. Balcony, we didn't use this space due to the noise from the surrounding buildings airconditioning units. This may be better in the full ocean view. But to be honest, if you can't afford the full view, don't bother with paying for the partial view because it is too unpleasant on the balcony to enjoy it. Save your money and go with city view. Overall I would not reccomend this hotel. Mainly due to the poor nights sleep that we endured due to the noise. If you are on a tight budget, it is a good option to consider. I'd prefer to pay a little extra and get some sleep.",sydney,"whereissnot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>sydney</strong>",15,3.0

The hotel room is minimal and not the most spacious, but it was so cheap compared to other hotels that I don't think you can really complain. By American standards, people may be disappointed, but I've spent way more on worse ""3 star"" hotels in europe. At least these rooms were clean and had a television.

My experience was great all through. Easy reservation procedure, prompt responses to queries from the reservation dept. We were to arrive early morning so I had requested for an early checkin. I was glad that my request was accepted and we were checked in immediately upon arrival. We had booked a partial ocean view room for 7 nights although I must say that the view from the ocean front room was awesome. As we did not intend to spend too much time inside the room, I did not bother to go for an upgrade. The partial ocean room also did provide a reasonable view of the ocean. As the building is circular, the adjacent balcony does not come right in front of yours and is a bit to the side. On the first day, we were given a room on the 6th floor looking over the adjacent McDonalds. Upon request, we were moved to the 10th floor room on the next day which was a much better location. Yes, the noise of the airconditioners on the adjacent buildings could be heard but it was not so bad once the balcony door was shut. It was very windy during most of our stay but the direction was such that it did not bother us if we stayed in the room. The room had a pretty big balcony/lanai. The rooms were tiny for sure especially with 4 of us including two fidity boys. Waikiki circle is a no frills hotel, no concierge, no spa, no inhouse restaurant (Eggs-n-things, which is housed in the same building is not a part of the hotel). But, we had read reviews beforehand and factored in all the negatives when deciding on staying at this hotel.The hotel is neat and clean with nice clean linen and towels. Beach towels can be borrowed from the reception. They now charge a $10 amenity fee which includes in room coffee maching, internet connection (wired), Sony PSP and DVD player and unlimited subscription of DVD and playstation games from the kiosk below. The best about this hotel is its location - right in front of the beach, within walking distance of eating places and convenience stores. The front desk staff members were nice and helpful.Before making the reservation, I had weighed the positives against the negatives and concluded that this hotel would suit the taste and liking of my family. My experience was exactly as I expected. For someone who is looking for a more glamourous hotel and cannot be comfortable in small rooms, this hotel may not be a good choice, however, other hotels at the same location are priced much higher.In conclusion, Aston Waikiki gives excellent value for money!","Singapore, Singapore","MRahul</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",89,4.0

The view is just jaw-dropping.It does seem quite small and no-frills compared to the hotels around it, but we didn't mind that at all.

Everything you need is nearby. The rooms are small-ish, but are clean and comfy. Really though, you don't go to Waikiki to stay in your room. Close to local buses and trolleys that will get you anywhere on the island. Beach (and surfing lessons) are right across the road.

But if you want clean rooms with great showers, friendly hotel reception staff, free beach towels and beach gear to borrow and right across from the beach then this is for you! You don't spend a lot of time in your room in Waikiki, but this was a great base to work from. It's brilliantly situated, all you need to do is cross the road to Waikiki Beach! We paid extra for the sea view when we stayed at the start of our trip and it was the as good a view from any part of Waikiki at a fraction of the cost of many of the other hotels. At the end of the stay we had a side room which was noisy due to the wind (the forecasts told us that winds were stronger than normal) which is why we have rated this hotel a 4 and not a 5. If we are ever lucky enough to return to Hawaii then we will definately be staying there again. Another review has said that Eggs n Things (restaurant under the hotel) isn't worth a visit but we would disagree. Yes, there are plastic plates and cutlery, but it's all part of the experience!

This is part of a continuing series of my impressions and experiences staying at various hotels and resorts while traveling to attend concerts worldwide. This review is for the Aston Waikiki Circle Hotel on Oahu, Hawaii. Additional photos published on my website.Property: Aston Waikiki Circle HotelLocation: Waikiki – Oahu (Hawaii)Address: 2464 Kalakaua Avenue, Honolulu, Oahu, HI 96815Phone: (877) 997-6667Website: www.astonwaikikicircle.comRoom Type/Class: Ocean Front Hotel Room (Room 306)Date: May 21-22, 2012Booking Source: DirectOverall Rating: 3/5 [Note: Score is totally subjective based on price, location, and comparison to ""like"" properties within same area and price range]My stay with this property was the last night of my trip. I had an early flight out of Honolulu the next morning (checking out before 6am) and was checking in fairly late the prior afternoon, so wanted to find a place to stay that was relatively inexpensive given the short stay (about 12 hours total). This property appeared to be located close to shops, dining, and the beach in Waikiki and was a short drive to the airport, so it served my needs in that regard.This was my first visit to Oahu, so I had no hands on experience with the area, and referenced TripAdvisor reviews for some feedback from others that have stayed at this and similar properties.The entrance to the hotel is located off a one-way street, with beach and ocean on the other side of the street. It would be easy to pass by, even with GPS, so my approach was slow in trying to find it.Once at the address, there appeared to be two options – drive toward an up and downward lane with a gate blocking the entrance, or up toward a small lot with two short term parking spots. All in all, it was very tight with no signage, so it was a bit of a guess as to what guests checking in are supposed to do. I opted to drive up to the area I had to guess was adjacent to registration, and parked in one of the two small parking spaces. Unlike most anywhere you park on the Hawaiian islands, I was not greeted by a valet, so decided to bring my luggage to a window that appeared to serve for registration. There was a sign posted that their parking lot was full (photo below) with directions for parking to a sister property that did not appear to be very close. Certainly not convenient.There was no lobby or anything of the sort – check-in was facilitated by talking with staff through a plastic window, the interior of which is more like what you might expect to find at a car wash, rather than a hotel. Lots of clutter and disorganization.There was some confusion and discussion among the employees at check in, though they decided to allow me to park on site (down the ramp with the up/down arm referenced earlier); they provided a remote to open the arm. There is an added charge of $15.71/night for on site, non valet parking.I took my bags up to my room, since they were already pulled out of the car, and then went back down the elevator to park my car for the night. One in the parking area below, the first impression is that there are much fewer spaces than rooms in the hotel, so it would appear to be common for guests to have to park at the remote sister property or make their own parking arrangements, which is no very convenient.The hotel itself is very unusual by design – it is a tall cylinder, and each floor is a small circle of rooms.The room itself was fairly basic and outdated, but appropriate for the price point and location.The bed was low to the ground and a bit rickety. The shower in the bathroom is smaller than most small closets, and with the showerhead pointed right at the shower curtain, which goes all the way to the floor in the standing stall, it would be easy to flood the floor of the bathroom with water.A small desk was also provided, with wired (ethernet) Internet service that was an extra fee of $9.95. There was also an empty refrigerator and a key operated safe in the closet.The room also featured a small balcony, and at least in the case of my room, a great beach and ocean view – probably the biggest benefit of the room.This was actually the only hotel of seven during this stay where I turned on the TV, and the reception was horrible – more snow on screen on some channels than actual show/content.It is somewhat kid-friendly, as there is a PS2 in the room, and a DVD rental kiosk down by the elevator.If you are coming to Hawaii with an expectation of service and luxury, you will not find it at the Aston Waikiki Circle.If you aren’t going to spend a lot of time in your room, want to be walking distance to most in and around Waikiki, and just need a place to crash at night that is not too expensive (depending on your room type and any kind of special offers available), it is worth a look. But I would highly recommend securing one of the ocean view rooms and seeing if you can make parking arrangements in advance (i.e. reserving a spot on site). I don’t feel any room would be worth more than $150/night, as there are so many other options and special offers at other properties.","Marina del Rey, California","RockSubculture</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marina del Rey, California</strong>",155,3.0

International Markets is about 2 blocks, high end name brands stores are along the entire strip, ABC Stores (one of the local attractions in Honolulu I think) are all within your eyesight which sell souvenirs, drinks, foods, swimwear, etc.....Local tour bus stops are along the entire Waikiki Beach areas which you can jump on anyone of them.I will definitely recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there in the future.",,BaldwinHotel,4,4.0

Despite being so small you have to ask for ice at the desk (not enough room on the hallways for a machine), it's a very good value for an ""ocean front"" room on Waikiki. We stayed in 1204 for 4 nights after being upgraded from 405 (we had asked for the highest floor available, and the 4th is what we were put in the first night after asking for the 13th or 14th floor when we made the reservation). It makes a huge difference how high up, and which angle of this ""chinese lantern"" shaped building you're in. If we had not been promised a better room after the first night, I'd have been booking into another hotel. If you can manage to get into rooms ending in 04 (the best) or 03, you have a direct view of Waikiki beach, and you avoid some really bad mechanical equipment noise from the roof of an adjacent building. The difference between a room ending in 05 (noise-exposed) and 04 was huge. You will not see Diamond Head from your patio because of taller buildings, but the view directly out, and ""towards Ewa"" is truly lovely. There is a convenient McDonald's with its free wifi (you'll pay extra in the hotel). One of the ABC stores very nearby has 4-day bus passes (not all of them do) and stops are conveniently located right in front of the hotel, and up on Kuhio (3 short blocks). (Call ""The Bus"" in Honolulu and ask them to mail you a free bus system map for Oahu/Honolulu.) Avoid the ""Eggs and Things"" restaurant in the lobby. It has high prices and unaccountably huge lines. There is a better to be had for breakfast at Arancino di Mare a couple of blocks away. Or you could get your McDonald's breakfast and take it across the street to the park. The sheltered beach swimming area is directly across the street and beach towels and floaty toys are provided if you ask at the desk. There is an outdoor shower to get the sand/salt water off. The desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Some real aloha going on there, despite the limitations of the building. This is the quieter end of Waikiki Beach (that being a relative term), and we were glad for it because the area around the Royal Hawaiian and the Sheraton is really nuts.",Los Angeles,"BustersMomLosAngeles</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles</strong>",9,4.0

We've stayed here a few times now and do so because of the fabulous location and the view from the room - has to be Ocean Front. Can't beat looking out the window when you wake up and seeing Diamond Head, palm trees and the ocean. Ahhhhhhh.The front desk staff were helpful and allowed us to check in early (saving us having to kill time hanging around on the street after a long flight). They don't have wifi yet, but apparently it is coming. Parking was a pain, and we ended up parking at an alternative site (cost less too). The room servicing staff missed leaving coffee for us a couple of times, and took us pulling up the sheets on the beds as them already being made, therefore not making the beds. The room was clean and the refurbishment is good. Pity they didn't replace the outdoor furniture too (our glass table was badly cracked). The two double beds make the room look much smaller and an option of a queen bed only would have been good and given us more room. Double beds aren't great for two people to sleep in either, so we slept in separate beds!! (Slept well, but not very romantic!!)Yes, you only get a room - there's no pool or bar - but the beach is across the road and you can visit any bar at any hotel you like. You really can't beat the price for the location and the view. And yes, it does get noisy, but every hotel I've stayed at in Waikiki is noisy - there are so many ABC shops receiving deliveries first thing in the morning that you really can't avoid the noise.Didn't understand the attraction and the long lines for the Eggs and Things restaurant - food didn't look great and it wasn't that cheap. Plus it was an ""Eggspress"" express restaurant so there was no time to relax and enjoy... Give me Maccas with complimentary pineapple any day!My only gripes about this hotel were the newspaper delivery person who insisted on slamming the complimentary newspapers down in front of each door at 4:30am every morning (very noisy guy) and the awful bacon smell that wafts up occasionally from the Eggs and Things on the ground floor.

The negatives - while clean, the room was tiny. There were only 2 of us, but we could hardly move around. Not sure if it was just our room, but we had 2 double beds which made it very cramped. The shower/bathroom was also small. We did pay for a 'partial ocean view room', but mainly the view was of the building next door! only when you venture onto the balcony, lean over and look past your neighbors balcony could you see the ocean. Also, the loud noise from the air conditioning of the neighboring building was terrible and gave us grief while trying to fall asleep.

What we appreciated most were: the friendly and helpful staff, the clean rooms with daily maid service, free beach towels and access to a variety of beach chairs, lilos etc. We had booked an ocean view room but upgraded for an extra $15.00 a night to an ocean front room on the eighth floor and what an investment it proved to be. We could sit on the lanai and watch all the sights day and night and soak up the amazing view. From other reviews we were expecting it to be noisy, but we slept like babies. Far less noisy than previous, more upmarket accommodation elsewhere in Waikiki. The beds were really comfortable as well.

We knew the rooms would be small, based on the reviews, but there was enough room for the three of us, it really wasn’t a problem since we were only in our room to sleep. The shower was quite small, and water pressure was only okay. We managed though. It was clean, and that’s the main thing for us. The cleaning staff were friendly and efficient. I did like having a coffee machine in our room and the small fridge came in handy. Our balcony partially faced the ocean – room 602 - I think next time I would get a full ocean view room, since our room was close to the supplies room and we could hear the door slamming at all hours of the night (even with ear plugs). The air conditioner was also very noisy. I would say the noise was the only bad thing about the hotel – I had only one full night’s sleep due to the noise, but I figured for the very reasonable price of the hotel, I would catch up on my sleep at the beach.The location was fantastic – right across the street from the beach! The front desk staff were friendly and helpful, and had copies of the bus routes and schedules, which was useful. There were two computers in the open lobby – access cost $5 per 20 minutes, and there was a printer to print off boarding passes (for a small fee). Beach toys were available to borrow, and although there is a restaurant attached to the hotel, the lineup was always so huge, we never ate there. We did see the menu and prices were no different from other restaurants with full service (e.g., Hula Grill at the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach, Margaritaville, etc) so we never bothered to stand in line (we did go down Seaside and Kuhio Ave to the Seaside Bar & Grill for an excellent breakfast of 2 huge pancakes, 2 scrambled eggs, and 2 slices of bacon – for $3.95 this can’t be beat – see review).We were able to have our room for an additional 12 hours on our check-out day, since our flight didn’t leave until 10:30pm. That was a very nice option, and it only cost $75 – we were able to spend the entire day at the beach and did not have to worry about storing our luggage or having a place to shower – it meant we had a full last day of our holiday. I know this is not the fault of the hotel, but the taxi that they called to take us to the airport over-charged us by $10 – he took a left turn out of the hotel, continued on for a few miles, and then finally headed in the direction of the airport – there was no shortcut involved. I would suggest that maybe they use a taxi company that they know will not rip off their clients.I would return to this hotel, but I would request a room as far away from the supplies room as possible.","Edmonton, Canada","tinav3_travels</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edmonton, Canada</strong>",144,4.0

The only reason why people give high ratings at this hotel is because it is cheap. Well, guess what? You get what you pay for. My friends and I booked two double beds at this hotel. We were shocked to find out that there was no floor space anywhere in our hotel room. Don't consider staying here if you're visiting Hawaii with more than two people. There will be no space to place your suitcase. My friends and I always felt crowded and cramped in our hotel room.When it got hot and humid at night, I wanted to leave the AC on while I was falling asleep. Unfortunately, the AC always made a rickety sound that was so loud that I couldn't sleep with the AC on. We visited Hawaii in August which is one of the hottest times of the year. I wasn't able to sleep comfortably. Then we left the window opened one night to keep our room cool. We woke up with mosquito bites even though we stayed on the 10th floor.This hotel room does not have a bathtub. It only has a shower stall. They used a white shower curtain. Unfortunately, the shower curtain was orange at the corners which was disgusting. I didn't want to know how old and unclean the shower curtain was, but we had to make-do with what we got ourselves into.If I ever go back to Hawaii, I would not stay at this particular hotel.

You will be able to see plenty of fish even without snorkelling gear. I saw a big turtle as well. Bring food and beverages cause there are none by the bay which is a marine reserve. You would have to go up the hill to get anything to eat or drink.There are showers and toilets, as well as rentals (lockers and masks).Coming back I stopped at Diamond Head, nice views but bring water and sneakers.We took a surfing lesson with Bigwave Dave (www.surfwithdave.com) and it was just WOW and yes I stood a few times on the board and I am 50 (it was my birthday gift from my daughter) I also bought the CD with the pictures but I thought it was pricey (60$).

Best rooms are oceanfront, ok, they cost more than partial ocean views, but give views of Waikiki Beach as good as any other hotel in the area at a fraction of their prices. The unusual shape of the hotel (like a Chinese lantern) was ideal when the property was built, as can be seen from the black and white photo in reception, when the property was surrounded by sand dunes and palm trees with a view in every direction. Progress has caught up, and hotels and condo's have now almost encircled the hotel. However, the position, is superb, it's at maybe the best spot on Waikiki Beach. For price and sea view, it's a winner, with a balcony. Room size, well, it is a circular building and is rather quaint and ""compact"". Room comfort and cleanliness, very good. Amenities, it's just a place to stay. There's no restaurant, however, there is an Eggs n' Things diner at the front (no business connection to the hotel). But it's only open from 6.00 am to 2.00 pm, and there's always an endless queue of mainly young Japanese tourists waiting to get a seat and serving.

By co-incident I stumbled across The Aston Circle – and, voila, here was the perfect match to meet our criteria. Following good conversations here on TripAdvisor pro and cons were turned with fellow members - and we are more than happy that we made this hotel our final choice. We booked one of the slightly more expensive oceanfront rooms and attached a request to the form for upper level – absolutely worthwhile. The latter had been duly noted and the receptionist handed us with a big smile the key to a room on the 12th floor (the hotel is 14th story high “only”). Our feet were swept totally away when we entered the room and met with a 180 degree undisturbed view of Waikiki Beach and the turquoise ocean as an endless backdrop! No reason to draw the curtains as you have complete privacy and hence, this panorama unfolded for our eyes every morning as could be fully enjoyed from the bed as well. To the room is a small balcony with a couple of plastic chairs and a coffee table. As the name so very well indicates, the hotel is shaped as a circle and hence the rooms do get sort of a funny shape. In spite of same and although likewise on the small size, the room was very light, airy and with a tropical decor and offered a good king size bed, a tiny corner with cloakroom and sink and a small bathroom with shower. Basic with no frills, but definitely clean and well maintained. American guests may not think much of the little bathroom, but we were all fine with it. And we loved the little humoristic features such as a tiny children’s sand bucket with shovel placed in the bathroom and a tiny orange rubber fish greeting us on the edge of the sink.OBS: If you are suffering from claustrophobia you may not like the open-fenced balconies that are placed outside the building as, admittedly, a couple of times it did feel a bit scary “hanging” on the wall in that height, but yet again, the view is so breathtaking that it’s all forgotten in a split second. Further, you have the option of a lower placed room, of course. The hotel has no other facilities as such apart from a tiny open air lounge/reception area and a tour-operator desk. But what else do you really need, when you have the mile long golden sandy beach and the bluest water just across the street? No need for a pool. Beach towels could be picked up with the reception, so all you had to do was to put on your swimsuit and flip-flops in your room, take the elevator down to the reception, pick up your towel and make your way across the street and place yourself in this water-wonderland! OK admittedly, it would have been nice if some sun-umbrellas and beach-seats could have been provided for – but you can find same at a small public beach-booth located just where you cross the street and from which surfboards and other watersport equipment are for rent. Neither does the hotel have a restaurant, but yet again – who need that when you have the entire Waikiki Beach with its numerous restaurants just next to you. It’s really only up to you to make your pick! Next to the hotel you do likewise find an ABC convenience store and several of the traditional budget take-away restaurants such as McDonald etc. Further, pick-up/drop-off for the many tour-coaches take place just a few yards down the side-street. Finally, a tiny green area/park is also to be found just across the street. Here several late afternoons we experienced free luaus – or even better – we could watch most of it from our very own balcony and hence at the same time enjoy a sundowner and the breathtaking orange sunset on the waters… We couldn’t have asked for a better location!OBS: Having no own garden-terrace, ocean-bar, restaurant etc. we enjoyed very much to stroll the short distance to legendary Moana Surfrider where we dined or sipped cocktails al fresco listening to the lapping water or local live music.OBS OBS: Even better than to rent sun-umbrellas – go to ABC and purchase your own at USD 15!The staff at The Aston Circle we experienced all to be very friendly and accommodating. We arrived midday and as our room wasn’t ready this early, we were immediately offered to change our clothes at a small toilet by the reception and leave the luggage with them in order for us to get as much out of our day as possible. Whenever we came to pick up a beach towel or to ask for directions we were met with a smile and a helping hand. Check-in/check-out went fast and smooth and one of the added bonuses to staying at The Aston Circle you are never wasting time as with its only 14 floors and limited number of guests you are never stuck in queues anywhere.As you may reckon we were fully satisfied with our stay at The Aston Circle and will most certainly choose to stay there again should our way take us to Hawaii again.

I had heard and read good things about this hotel, so decided to stay here for one night before staying at another hotel with some friends for the rest of my stay in Waikiki. I booked an Ocean Front room with two double beds from hotelclub.com.au for a really affordable rate. I landed in Honolulu at 8am, so I wasn’t surprised that my room was not yet available, and wouldn’t be, until after midday. But, once they realised I was on my own, they were able to offer me a room with only one double bed, but on a higher floor (12th floor – there are only 14 floors) that would be available sooner; Perfect!The location was/is amazing, you literally cross the road and you’re at the beach! Not to mention Yoghurtland being a stone's throw away too! I would suggest booking an Ocean Front room; the uninterrupted view of the beach (and the sunset) is well worth the little difference between the room type rates. Due to the nature of the building, the rooms are an odd shape, but it didn’t bother me at all as the design and layout of the room accommodated the shape of the building. However, I wouldn’t suggest any more than two people staying in each room – purely due for comfort in terms of physical space. The bed was heavenly and is one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on – and I stay in hotels quite often. All staff were super friendly and accommodating and endeavoured to meet my needs at all times. Considering the view of an ocean front room, I am surprised at how affordable this hotel is. The only bad thing about my stay was that it was only for one night! I would have extended my stay at this hotel, but unfortunately it was fully booked!I’m returning to Waikiki in a few months and will most likely stay here again and I will most definitely be recommending this gem of a hotel to anyone travelling to Waikiki – trust me, you will not regret it.","Sydney, Australia","mootleycrue</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",5,5.0

We were lucky enough to get room 1304 which is ocean front --- couldn't beat the views of Waikiki and high-up enough to miss most of the road/pedestrian noise. While on our balcony we discussed that the less expensive 1303 would have been fine for us as it had a great view too. The balcony is wonderful with two chairs and a small table. The room had an exellent fridge -- much better than most hotels. The beds and pillows were top quality and we slept like babies. We rented a car for one day to drive to the northern beaches (highly recommend this), but we didn't keep the car over night so didn't need to park -- but we noticed that there was a ""lot full"" sign in the office window each afternoon. The elevators were great, never had to wait to get up or down, even one afternoon when some kids were playing with the buttons! (brought back some memories :-)) The staff were extremely nice and helpful -- there was a great wake-up call feature on the phone too. The hotel had discarded floats and boogie boards for use, great idea. Ok, downsides. The rooms are tiny, and the bathroom is mini! We are two average sized people and we were forever bumping into each other. The second bed was used for luggage which helped, but we both agreed that one queen bed would have made all the difference. I guess two doubles accommodates families or those who don't want to share a bed, but if we'd had a kid with us the room would have been hysterically too small. I read on some other reviews an air of anticipation for the openning of ""Eggs and things"" -- the breakfast/lunch joint attached to the hotel... It's very average. We found it to be over priced for a basically take-out place (order at register where you are asked to tip? And then called to pick up food on paper plates with plastic cuttlery). Besides all that, it was the worst feed we had while in Hawaii -- including the airport!

The location is right across the street from the beach - you are steps away from McDonalds and their famous ABC stores for pop, snacks, etc. The front desk staff is very nice and helpful.

Rooms are small but not uncomfortably so. We had two adults and an 11 year old and had no problems. Of course, we're in Hawaii, we don't stay in the room much. As in all of Waikiki, parking can be an issue. They oversell their parking garage, so if you get back late as we did one night you may need a desk clerk to help. They have an agreement with another hotel for overflow parking but we never had to use it. The main selling point is the view from your lanai. Get an ocean FRONT room. This hotel is not what people think of when they think of a luxurious Hawaii vacation, but when you are sitting out on your ocean front room lanai you have a better view than 99% of those other hotel rooms that are charging a lot more.","Houston, Texas","stivhold</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",1,5.0

Great location in Waikiki right opposite the Duke! There are numerous restaurants/shops nearby, and a very handy ABC store right outside. rooms are clean and bright, and all you need for your stay. While by no means luxurious, you get a great deal for your money, and a nice big balcony. Parking is available at hotel for about $15, but limited, so make sure you tell reception if you need a space. There are beach towels available free of charge, and also a handy 'borrow box' of beach accessories previous guests have left behind, like body boards and mats. Great idea! This would have been a 5 star review if it wasn't for the charge for using the in-room safe. I just don't understand why they charge $2.50 per night for something which is in the room anyway - it's not as if it's to cover lost keys or anything, as they will charge you $35 if you do this. I know it's not much money, but it's the principle of it, and it feels like just a way to get more money out of you. You are made aware of charge in advance, but it's just strange as the safe and key are in room whether you use them or not, so why charge?To finish on a more positive note, the staff is really friendly and helpful with any enquiries you may have. There is also a tour desk at the hotel. Although we didn't use this, it was good to know they were there if we needed them rather than take a chance with one of the street vendors, where you don't know if you are getting a genuine deal.Great place, and would definately return!",SteveMarsh73,"SteveMarsh73</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>SteveMarsh73</strong>",37,4.0

I have stayed at this hotel twice (1993 & 2011) - each time for a week. The hotel is located on Kalakaua Avenue directly across the street from Kuhio Beach – it is a 30-second walk from the lobby to the beach. Kuhio Beach is the eastern portion of the Waikiki shoreline close to Kapiolani Park and proffers protected swimming areas because of the breakwater. Though not the newest structure, it is a modern hotel with several rooms having excellent views over the waters of Waikiki and Mamala Bay. The hotel itself is a modest edifice comprising 14 stories but, at the same time, it has a rather distinctive appearance because of its round shape. The guest rooms are adequate in size, sensibly furnished and decorated in a tropical theme but, the bathrooms are small. The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel recently completed a major renovation of all rooms. There are eight rooms per floor and all are virtually identical in layout and furnishings including the balconies. However, there is one BIG variation amongst the rooms – the outside view/scenery aspect. As I suggested earlier, this aspect is also one the hotels greatest attributes because the views from some rooms are among the best to be found in Waikiki – bar none. Of course, the room rates are governed by this fact. If a view is important to you, then I highly recommend that you select the “Ocean Front” category and, specifically, any of the room numbers ending with either –04 or –05. The higher the floor, the better, with the two best rooms being 1404 & 1405! Sitting on the balcony, sipping a beverage and watching the sunset is a gratifying experience. If a view is not important then choose the “city” or “partial ocean” view categories but be forewarned that your view will be that of an adjacent building/hotel. Speaking of prices, I suggest you visit the hotel’s own website and check out the various specials and deals before booking reservations through any other source. The room rates and various promotional packages they offer are worth the money and some give you a great bang for your buck! The guest amenities proffered by the hotel are rather basic and few. The hotel provides beach towels, boogie boards, daily newspapers, internet service (for fee) and parking ($15.00/day). However, parking space is limited and be forewarned that they may not have parking stalls for all guests on site if too many bring cars (though they offer an off-site lot as an alternative). The best thing to do may be to not use your car more than necessary once you've arrived and leave it parked (until you depart). There is also a tourist excursion/activities desk in the lobby. Though the hotel itself does not offer many amenities, there are plenty of options and opportunities for dining, shopping, entertainment and outdoor activities nearby. Adjacent to the hotel are a McDonalds restaurant, Haagen Daaz ice cream store, creperie and ABC souvenir store/mini-mart (incl. liquor section). Moreover, a short walk in almost any direction will elicit a multitude of options too numerous to mention here. The famous Duke’s Canoe Club restaurant and the International Market Place are each about a 7 – 10 minute walk from the hotel. After all this positive commentary I must observe that there are a couple of negative items to mention but they are minor and may be inconsequential for some. One issue is the noise emanating from outside which can be heard within some rooms - particularly if there is a lot of traffic, loud passersby and/or noisy crowds outside (which is often noticeable in the evening). This may prove problematic for sleeping. Requesting either a high floor or a room away from the street may remedy this concern. Secondly, the low-level, ambient hum from the air conditioner may be bothersome for some. For light sleepers and people from other time zones, these various noises can make sleeping difficult and the room environment less relaxing. Thirdly, if you prefer or are used to a firm mattress, then the beds in this hotel may prove disappointing because I feel they are soft and lack support. In fact the bed may be uncomfortable for two people sleeping together in the same bed because their combined weight creates a depression/valley in the mattress. Finally, I wish the hotel offered a few rooms furnished with just one queen or king bed per room instead of two double beds so that couples could experience a more romantic setting during their stay. Doing so would also make those rooms appear to be more spacious. Getting to/from the airport is fairly easy. If ground transportation has not been pre-arranged, and you are not renting a car, then I recommend one of the several shuttle or van services that exist and charge between $7.50 - $11.00 each way (with better pricing if you commit to the roundtrip). If you have little or no luggage, then the public bus is an option and it costs only $2.50. Use Bus Route Nos. 19 or 20 headed east with Waikiki as the final destination. The buses stop outside both the international and inter-island terminals on the departure level service road. You can go online to pre-book ground transportation or simply do it upon arrival. Some of the shuttle companies have representatives in the baggage claim areas promoting their services. I recommend this hotel because of its location, simplicity and great views. It is not upscale and lacks the accoutrements, pretentiousness and sophistification of such establishments. But, for what it offers - which is relative comfort, cleanliness, convenience and value - this is a great hotel!","Snohomish, Washington","bjaune</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Snohomish, Washington</strong>",202,4.0

The location is awesome, with a beautiful beach directly across the street. The hotel rooms are fine and perfectly clean -- not extravagant by any stretch, but completely adequate. There is noise from entertainment at nearby hotels or on the beach in the evenings, but with the in-room AC going, I didn't find this to be a problem. The internet is wired only and costs $10/day or $40/week. It is spotty - I had to call the helpdesk twice - once because it wouldn't connect at all and once because it had slowed to a crawl. After the second call, the helpdesk guy said there was something physically wrong with the line and that they would send someone in 24-48 hours and I should change rooms. When I told the front desk, of course all rooms were full, so the following day they changed me to another room. The internet connection was not much better in the second room. I could check email and slowly load pages, but skype connections kept dropping and wasn't fast enough to allow video most of the time. The front desk staff was fine. I did not find them overly friendly or helpful (it seemed that I was an inconvenience when the internet did not work, no one ever said sorry for the trouble it caused me). They did only charge me for one week's internet rather than 9 days. They also charged me 75 cents per phone call made from the room, including those to the helpdesk for the internet. Use of the in-room safe is also an additional charge. Other hotels are very near - you can see into other rooms and they can presumably see into yours - close your curtains! There is no tub, just a shower. Would I stay there again? Yes probably. It was a good budget hotel, clean, and the location was perfect.

We were there 2 nights and saw it go from dirt to a nice stone path maybe 75% done before we left. The rooms were very nice. Clean, fresh updated linens. Yes, the rooms are small but we usually take cruises where the rooms are 1/2 the size so that wasn't an issue for us. The rooms are VERY clean. The maids didn't seem to understand that empty McDonalds bags were garbage unless they were in the can, but eh, so what. I took that to mean they were extra careful not to throw away anything ""assuming"" it was trash. I was trying to really come up for a complaint about this place but really couldn't. The staff was wonderful. Our TV remote wasn't working so we mentioned to the front desk up leaving for a few minutes. It or the batteries were replaced by the time we returned....a nice LG flat screen too. I guess I would say that my only complaint was that the only option in rooms is 2 double beds. I was told there aren't any rooms with 1 Queen or King. Again, so what. Then the only other thing was free wi-fi would have been a nice feature to offer, at least with there being a lack of others, like a pool. $10 a day is a bit steep especially when you can go to McDonalds about 10 yards away for free Wi-Fi.

We had booked a city view, and upgrading was not possible when we checked in. The city view, however, was fabulous, and equally exciting since we come from a small Montana city with no high rise buildings. After reading comments on noise, however, I chose the top floor. That meant that the wind was always blowing really hard on the balcony, so it was probably not the best choiice, tho we loved the view from up there!  The room was very quiet and although small, it was arranged efficiently. We had no problems keeping it comfortable. Even the bathroom was totally fine for the 4 of us. We did take some rope to run a line for hanging damp swimsuits on. This worked well since the bathroom had little space for hanging anything but the wettest items. Beds were great - we all slept soundly every night. The staff was awesome, from office personnel to cleaning crew. We felt truly welcome and didn't hesitate to go to them with questions. After we stored our luggage for awhile when checking out, I suddenly realized that I'd accidently packed an important asthma inhaler. They instantly tracked that bag down in a room full of luggage. And of course the location is amazing. Even when going to the beach wasn't on the schedule for the day, we could still run over for a quick 15 minute swim. Morning surf lessons were right there.

Also trying to get in and out of parking is a hassle since the Waikiki sidewalk is always bustling with people. it's close to several bars, so no need to drink and drive. :-)They also allowed us a late check out with no extra charge.

The flatscreen TV had enough channels to keep us amused, the balcony (lanai) was great for enjoying an evening drink, or our morning cup of tea (or just admiring the view!)The ABC Shop right under the hotel was fantastic, we'd buy our breakfast there each day and either sit on our balcony or take it across to the beach.

Our room was right off the elevator on the 5th floor. Prime location for viewing waikiki beach across the street. One whole side of our room was a huge sliding door to our lanai. We could lay in bed and view the ocean. We enjoyed watching the 4th of July parade, people watching, and watching the surfers from our lanai. It's a busy street but not too noisy considering how busy it is. We all slept well on comfortable beds. My husband and I went with our teenagers, 18 and 14, and we were all comfortable although it was small. My recommendation would be to put away all our clothes and stow the empty suitcases in your closet. There is also storage shelves in the closet for clothes. This will provide you with adequate floor space to move around. The bathroom and shower were small but workable for us. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The only minus I would say is that we could hear the wind blow through the halls, and it rattled our door a bit as there are small open spots in the door frame. Once I knew what it was it didn't bother us a bit. We also could hear people's voices echo in the hall when they were on their way to their rooms, but we could not hear anything room to room, nor hear anyone above us. You can book great trips through the travel center right in the building. We enjoyed parasailing, swimming with the dolphins and sea turtles catamaran trip, circle island tour (nearly every popular site), and Germaine's Luau (Georgie was a riot!)....lots to see and do on foot and through the tours. You don't even need a rental car. The hotel has computers in the lobby with free check in for your flights, you do pay 50 cents per page to print out your passes however (by credit card), but very convenient.

If you need a beach chair or mat or beach toys, they have a box outside in the parking lot where you can leave anything you purchase for the next guest, or you can borrow anything left behind by previous guests.

While I agree with other reviewers that the room is fairly small and the bathroom borderline tiny, as a solo traveler, I was not bothered by this as most of my time was spent away from the hotel exploring the island. When I was in the room, I was able to gaze upon the beautiful sunsets on Waikiki without being among throngs of people on Kalakaua Ave below. I don't think you'll find a better oceanfront value on Waikiki. The room was clean and my only complaint is that the bottom of the shower curtain was a bit mildewy (I'm sure it's hard to prevent that with the overall size of the shower and lack of ventilation), but overall, the housekeeping service was great. I especially appreciated the late 2pm check-out at no additional cost since my flight wasn't until later in the evening. Hotel is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Waikiki Aquarium, International Marketplace, and anything on Kalakaua Ave. Bus stop is conveniently only one block away on Kuhio Ave. The only thing that will make this hotel even better is the opening of Eggs 'n Things in the Fall....

Firstly if you are looking for the best location across the road from the largest swimming lagoon in Waikiki this is it. The hotel although listed as a budget property should not in any way put you off from giving it a go. Don't judge a book by it's cover this really is the best value for the best location in WaikikiAll rooms have been recently upgrades, they are light and airy with two large queen side beds, flat screen T.V fridge along with a safe at an additonal minimum fee. The ocean front and ocean view rooms simply are stunning with lower graded rooms providing sea views with exception of the city view room which is same quality/facilities but very limited view so if on a tight budget and the view not important then this also for you. I would however pay a little more for the view over the beach and ocean.The shower although not large is fully tiles with good water flow and plenty of hot water with all modern features. Fresh good quality towels provided daily with beach towels on request.There is tea and coffee provided each morning.The staff both front office and house maids extremely polite and friendly.Overall this is a must try hotel and if considering and you know you are not booking a ""Sheraton"" then I am sure you will not be disappointed.

A simple call from the airport assured us that everything was fine and our room would be ready when we arrived. We arrived around 8pm and were welcomed by Jan. She had the paperwork ready and within 5 minutes we were relaxing in our room. The room (& bathroom) were clean as was the beautiful balcony. If you are going to stay here pay the extra to get an Ocean Front room the view is well worth the price. As soon as you book your room call the hotel and request a room on the highest floor available. Although you can hear other rooms in the hall way once you are in your room the only thing you hear is the ocean (when you have the balcony open.) The beach is right across the street and the view of the ocean, surfers, moonlight, and beach are all breath taking regardless of the time of day. The hotel is centrally located. You only have to walk a couple of blocks in any direction to find restraunts, convenience stores, shopping, and anything else your stay may require. The first day you are there I suggest you grab a map and walk around Waikiki to get your bearings. Eggs & Things is opening up in front of the hotel. McDonald's is on the corner and an ABC Convenience Store is next door. One block towards Diamond Head is a Burger King and a little further is a Subway if you want fast food. Our favorite affordable places to eat were Denny's (they have the $2,4,6,8 menu) on Kuhio near the international marketplace (ask for Tina in the mornings) & the China Buffet on Ala Moana in front of the Ramada (7.99 breakfast, 9.99 lunch, & 15.99 dinner.) We ate at Atlantis Seafood & Steaks for our wedding dinner. The food was good but the steaks were cooked one level less than ordered. I ordered Well Done and recieved Medium Well and my husband ordered his medium well and recieved medium rare. The Mahi Mahi was delicious. It was under $60 for two entrees, 2 iced teas, and 1 dessert. Keep your eyes open for the specials and only order the specials. Restraunts & attractions lure you in with the specials but keep asking you if you want extras. If you go with the extras your bill tends to double or triple. Watch out for the street vendors. They people with the parrots will come up to you and put the birds on you and take a picture of it with your camera then charge you $10 or more for the experience after you have already done it. The gold, silver, & newspaper people will stay frozen in place. If you put a dollar in their can they come to life and show their gratitude with interactive poses. If you want excellent deals on t-shirts, dresses, sarongs, baggage, flip flops, and souvenirs then visit the Aloha Stadium Swap Meet/Flea Market on Saturday or Sunday from 6am-3pm. You can take the #42 bus out there but if you buy a suitcase bigger than carry-on you will have to pay a shuttle to take you back to your destination. Take the #65 bus to the Byodo-In Temple. There is a 1/4 mile walk from where the bus lets you off to the Temple and admittance is $3/person. It is a wonderuflly peaceful experience and there are many great views of the mountains both on your way there and back and at the temple grounds itself.Dillingham airfield is the place to go for skydiving, glider riding, and airplane rides. Skydive Hawaii does not go up as high as Pacific Skydiving. Mr. Bill of Honolulu Soars is the man to talk to for the glider rides. He has wonderful background information about the area. Ask for Flight man Dwight to take you for your glider ride. He is ex-military and knows his stuff about the island.Stay away from the thrift stores like Savers, Goodwill and Salvation Army Thrift. You can buy most everything new for the same price they charge.Take the free Hilo Hattie Trolley. One of the driver's is Aunt Frannie! She is an amazing guide filled with helpful information. Ask her about the free peanut butter & jelly sandwhiches!Learn to snorkel or at least get a pair of goggles and put your face in the water and look at the underwater life. Even on Waikiki beach there are many fish and other sea life who love to show off for visitors. If you are going to get married there do it at either sunrise or sunset on Magic Island in Ala Moana Park. It is amazing.You won't spend much time in your room. When you are, the balcony will be your favorite place!","Collinsville, Illinois","Countreefly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Collinsville, Illinois</strong>",11,5.0

I’m talking claustrophobia inducing tiny. They each include a little lanai which is about ½ the size of the room, a refrigerator, TV, etc. It was really tough for 3 of us to get comfortable in the room as you can’t pass another person without that person having to move out of the way. Like I said, TEENY.Also, even with the blackout curtains the room stays well lit due to the cracks between and under doors and curtains. Also, since the rooms are (you guessed it) teeny, you can hear everyone in the halls and waiting for the elevators, and occasionally people in other rooms as well. You can pay to use the computers downstairs, but it’s expensive and kind of slow loading. Beach towels are available at no charge at the front desk. Also - they charge you for parking, ut didn't mention it at check in.All in all, I’d stay here if I were on a budget but would really opt for a nicer room at a different hotel if I could afford to do so!","Seattle, Washington","GSather</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",57,3.0

The location of the hotel is very good and the rooms have recently been remodeled, but they are very very small, especially the bathroom was tiny. The insulation of the balcony sliding door was terrible and therefore we woke up to a lot of street noise in the morning. The ocean view from the rooms is very nice though and the rooms are very clean. The hotel doesn't have a lobby or any common areas. It definitely feels more like a hostel than a hotel. The staff was nice but not very helpful, except with bus schedules and some directions. You have to pay for internet, parking is 12 USD +tax per night.As a conclusion I can say that we enjoyed the location, but we didn't really enjoy the hotel. The price was very competitive though, what might compensate a lot of the negative aspects. if you don't mind staying 2-4 blocks away from the beach, then you should rather go for the Best Western or one of the Aqua hotels.","Houston, Texas","BFra</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",4,3.0

It does not have a real lobby. It has an outdoor lobby and that it is just fine, becuase you won't care since the beach is so close. You must get the ocean view room or at least partial ocean view room to get the real experience of this hotel. The views are really great. If you get a city view, well..... then you are just paying for staying right on the beach, and that is good too. I highly recomend it. The only con is the noise from the busy street and people partying and playing on the beach. (Yes, you are that close, especialy if you get an ocean veiw room).","Kilauea, Hawaii","JeremyKalihiwai</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kilauea, Hawaii</strong>",129,5.0

You can wake up to the sound of the ocean and watch the sunset from your deck. Let's face it, most people go to Hawaii for the beach, not the hotel room. The price is reasonable for the location (compared to the other hotels that brag oceanview) and you are close to the International Market and loads of other restaurants, shopping and activities.Servicing of the rooms can happen anywhere between 11:00 and 2:00, so be prepared to come back to your room not being cleaned at some times during the day.I'm not the type of person that really cares too much about the elegance of the room, I don't plan on staying in it for more than sleeping anyways. There is no restaurant or pool, but again, the ocean is no more than twenty feet from the entrance and there are restaurants all over the place.Tip: If the power goes off and you find yourself stuck in the elevator (happened to a family during our trip; freak weather), wait about ten minutes for the emergency backup power to come on. Before then, you can try all you want to open the door, but won't succeed. (Family found that out when the fire department finally showed up and effortlessly opened the door. The father swore that he tried everything to open the door. Poor guy.)","Langley, BC","Kwito</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Langley, BC</strong>",2,4.0

I've been very pleased with it. It's right opposite the beach where all the action is. We stayed in a room with partial ocean views, and it's well worth the cheaper price. We got quite a lot of ocean in our view and could sit out on our balcony watching the surfers or the people on the beach. The room itself was quite nice. It's all just been renovated, so it's not run down or anything. Our beds seemed to be on a slight angle but we still slept fine. There was a fridge and a safe in the room and toiletries were provided. The only thing I didn't like was that the bathroom door had a blue bubbly glass panel down the middle and you can kind of see shadows and stuff. I don't like any kind of glass in bathroom doors as I'm a very private person, but I guess some people wouldnt mind. The people at the front desk were very helpful when we had questions and we took advantage of the beach towels you can borrow. There is internet and a printer in the lobby, but its not free. If I come back to Waikiki I will definately stay here again. You can't beat the great price for the location!",Melbourne,"meganrachael</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",46,5.0

Friendly staff, clean rooms, across the beach from the center of Waikiki beach, and walking distance from dining areas and stores. They have free beach towels in the front desk that you check in/out each time you get one, they have body boards, life savers, and surf boards that can be borrowed on a first come first serve basis, free coffee from 0645 to 0900 am, $12 nightly parking, $2.50 safe fee (inside the room), computer rentals in the lobby, and they charge for wi-fi (not sure how much). We got complimentary newspaper everyday and housekeeping kept our room spot-free everyday. The room came with a flat screen tv, 2 double beds, a nightstand, a study table, a fridge, a safe, and a closet. We had a patio that overlooks the ocean and other hotels in the area. The shower area and bathroom are very very very small, and the hotel itself is old, but who goes to Hawaii to stay in.
