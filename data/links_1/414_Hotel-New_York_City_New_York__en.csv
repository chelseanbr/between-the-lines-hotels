The hotel is a traditional walk-up--so not suited for everyone, but the extra exercise is probably not a bad thing after the included (!) wine/cheese ""social hour"" (or more like a couple of hours)...and sitting by the fireplace, chatting with other guests, was also delightful. Breakfast is included, too...and a great cappuccino machine always at the ready. The rooms are huge (per NYC standards), clean, and surprisingly quiet. They even provide a mini fridge with a few sodas/water, plus a small selection of snacks, replenished daily--for only $1 each (which is practically free, especially by hotel norms)!

We made our reservations 9 months in advance, based on the location, perceived value and reviews on TripAdvisor. We were in touch with the staff a few times before our visit as they were extremely responsive to our questions, offered suggestions and even made our reservations for a car to pick us up from the airport, and get us back after our stay. From the moment we walked into the lobby, the staff went above and beyond to ensure we had a great stay. The cozy feel of the lobby and courtyard created an inviting atmosphere to get to know the other Guests while enjoying the breakfast or wine and cheese in the evening. While neither of these offerings are meant to replace a meal, we found them to be a great option that allowed us to better budget our other activities throughout the week, as we didn't need huge meals (which get expensive). The proximity to Restaurant Row, the Theatre District, Times Square and the Hudson put us right in the middle of almost everything we wanted to do. Traveling to other areas, such as Battery Park and the 9/11 Memorial was a quick ride via Lyft/Uber/Juno/etc... or a subway ride.

The hotel is old but it is extremely clean and welcoming. The stairs are narrow but the staff is happy to help you if needed. The room was very comfortable. The ac worked perfectly. The extra bed cot was comfortable as well. Third hotel staff - I have never met a hotel where everyone on the staff was cheerful, helpful and made you feel important.

This is not a new hotel, and not modern. But the earnest and welcoming nature of the staff was exceptional and set the tone for a great stay. They were helpful, accommodated a variety of requests we had, and gave us great recommendations for new things to explore. We had arrived before check-in and went out for lunch, and upon our return we were touched to find our luggage and previously-shipped formal dress waiting for us in our room. A small gesture but above and beyond your typical experience.The standard rooms are bigger than most NYC hotels I've enjoyed in this price range. Being able to put luggage in one part of the room and still have a clear path to walk around cannot be understated. Didn't feel like a hotel room. Bed was too firm for me, but your mileage may vary. Quiet and cold A/C, nice TV and cable channels, large bathroom. Complementary sparkling wine and SNACKS FOR $1. Yes, a mini-can of Pringles for one dollar in a New York City hotel. Breakfast was modest but sufficient, the free happy hour had nice booze and great snacks. For comparison, we stayed at a newer hotel later that week for a similar price. Rooms were super modern but so very tiny. Like, ""there's no place for my luggage and we can't get to our clothes and I'm angry"" tiny.

It’s a small boutique hotel with no elevator. I knew I wouldn’t get the best room because of the special, but I got a nice room, except for the location, which was by the front desk, which made it rather noisy. Our room abutted the adorable little I courtyard, which was only a problem when the really loud people decided to sit out there and yack after 11 pm. The front desk asked them to quiet down. I thought there should be signs asking people to keep it down out there after a certain time. I don’t mind noise till 10 or so usually, but I was tired from traveling. Pros on the hotel: wine and cheese hour 5:30-7 was great! Continental breakfast and champagne in our room, great. Staff was outstanding. Room was very clean, great water pressure and plenty of hot water. Good location in vibrant neighborhood. Great temperature control in room.

A free tour was being run to Central Park which looked great but unfortunately it was the day after we left.

It was more reasonably priced than some of the other hotels in the theater district and had positive reviews, so decided to give it a try. I liked the fact that it was a more intimate accommodation than a big chain hotel (more like a B&B), and yet was in a perfect spot to hit the theater district and area restaurants. All staff members we encountered were very friendly and helpful. The front door is locked at night for security, but the lobby is manned 24 hours/day and someone is always available to buzz you in. Our room was clean and comfortable, but had a couple of drawbacks. It was located on the ground floor across the courtyard (which, by the way, would be a nice spot to sit on a pleasant day, but it was too cool, cloudy, wet during our visit to do so) and upon entering, we noted a strong damp, musty smell in the room (this might not be an issue on the upper floors, or perhaps the wet weather contributed). We could also hear the people upstairs walking around, but on the upside, there was no street traffic noise. It was a good sized room with a very comfortable, firm, king-sized bed outfitted with crisp white linens and plenty of pillows. While the furnishings were basic, it had everything we needed--plenty of closest and drawer space, a roomy bathroom with tub/shower combo (the sink/vanity was outside the bathroom--also convenient), good lighting, easily controllable heating/cooling, mini-fridge, ironing board/iron, and a safe. They include breakfast in the rate, and there's a selection of baked goods (scones were very tasty), cereal, yogurt, fruit, etc., offered. They also have a cheese and wine available in the early evening. Coffee and tea are available throughout the day. You can park on the next block over and get a $10 discount off the rate when the hotel stamps your parking ticket. Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay and wouldn't hesitate to return to this property, although I'd probably choose a different room for the reasons stated above.","Poughkeepsie, New York","tinav356</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Poughkeepsie, New York</strong>",11,4.0

The hotel is located in a converted 4 story rowhouse on a residential part of 46th Street between 9th and 10th Ave, half a block away from the heart of the Hell’s Kitchen district of Mid-Town Manhattan. Great location about a 5-7 minute walk from Time Square 42nd street subway station or Port Authority Bus Terminal if arriving by public transportation. Check in was smooth and painless, and the room was a generous size for NYC standards. The room was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was functional. Queen size bed was above average if not the best I’ve slept in. Strong wifi signal in the room and in the lobby was free of charge. Continental breakfast was included in the room rate and consisted of unlimited coffee/tea/espresso, orange juice, toasted bread/bagels with butter/cream cheese/jelly, a good selection of yogurts, scones, cereals, and assorted fruits. A basic but nonetheless satisfying way to start the day. The staff was extremely friendly and engaging, and was instrumental in assisting hotel guests with useful suggestions, trip planning, booking tours and reservations. I have been to coming to NY for the majority of my life, in fact growing up, I used to spend all my summers at my grandparents’ house in Queens, so I consider myself well versed on what to see and do and how to get around the City, but Jaqui was able to give us some useful tidbits that even I did not know about. Don’t hesitate to ask the staff of you need any advice or assistance to maximize the enjoyment of your stay. The only negative I feel I should point out is that there can be quite a bit of street noise that can be somewhat of a nuisance, especially in the middle of the night, from people (homeless or drunk) talking loudly, sirens, garbage trucks, etc. We stayed in room 404, which faces the street, but I imagine if you get one of the inside facing rooms, this may not be a major concern. This is not the hotels’s fault, and I don’t hold them responsible for what happens outside of their building, but I only bring this up in full disclosure. All in all, a great hotel in the best part of Manhattan, and at a very reasonable rate. Without equivocation, I give 414 Hotel my highest recommendation to anyone in search of a great hotel in the enchanting metropolis of New York.Dr. Kingstone Shih and Laura MenesesLos Altos, California USA","Los Altos, California","shithappens</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Altos, California</strong>",30,5.0

While the hotel is far from modern and certain conveniences not evident, it still is a great place to stay. The only issues I found is that the courtyard had scaffolding that is in place for a reno next door that has been on hold and the staff office needs to be cleaned up since that is open to the lobby and eating area.

The location of the hotel is really awesome, it was near the theatres with a 10-min walk (we watched several broadway shows) and there were great restaurants around for any occasion/cuisine too. The nearest metro is also located in Times Square/Port Authority Bus Terminal which is also a 10 min walk away but that’s really no issue because those are the central stations and it can get you anywhere you want pretty quickly! There were few occasions we headed back in between shows/shopping trips to catch a nap or drop our stuff because that was how convenient it was!15 mins walk to Grand Central Park, it is also walkable to rockerfeller center which takes about 25-30 mins but that shouldn’t be a problem with nice weather. Staff were extremely friendly and it really felt like we were home every time we stepped into the hotel. They were warm and extremely helpful to answer your queries or give you tips. They arranged car services for us to and fro from Newark Airport which was extremely helpful since we stayed in central area and Uber fares are usually skyrocketing. Free walking tours to Central Park are organise every Saturday I believe. Breakfast was simple with bagels, spread, toast, cereal and yoghurt. The social hour with wine, cheese and beer was a very heartening touch and seemed extremely popular with guests! Room amenities were what you need to have a fantastic stay. A big shoutout to Rachel from 414 Hotel too who was of a big help prior to our stay liaising for the car and concierge services. She was always extremely friendly, greeting guests with a big smile, it was just heartwarming to always see her and speak with her.Thank you staff of 414 hotel for a great stay, we will be back for sure!!

All of the staff great, particularly Emmy. The hotel is close to many good restaurants and taverns and midtown activities. We particularly enjoyed hearing Jazz at Birdland which was about 3 blocks away. Our third floor room was clean with nice paintings on the walls and a good view of the street. There was a free bottle of wine in the room to greet us. The only thing I would mention that is remotely critical is that it is a small four floor hotel with no elevators. If you have problems hiking up stairs ask for a room on the bottom two floors. My wife and I are 70ish and the stairs were only a tiny problem. Staff readily helped by carrying our bags up and down the stairs. The next time we are in New York this is where we will stay.",,John M,0,5.0

You are treated like family and the congenitally that they (and especially Rachel) create in the combination reception /breakfast-happy hour area is almost magical. Complete strangers open up to each other in the blink of an eye. As someone who has literally traveled all over the world I've never experienced such instantaneous camaraderie as the 414 creates. The staff also bends over backwards to make your stay great. We found a wallet outside the hotel on the way back fron dinner one night and while it had the owner's driver's license and credit cards there was no address or telephone number. What to do? The staff took over and went on Facebook to track him down and by the next morning reunited him with his property. Try getting that kind of service at a Hilton. Also, had the best coffee I've ever had at a hotel. Did I forget to mention that the rates are incredibly good for such a well situated place and your room rate includes free breakfasts and wifi.

The positive: The employees, 5 star all the way. All were kind and helpful and totally sincere in their efforts. We felt welcome at all times. There is not enough good that can be said about everyone we met who worked at the 414 Hotel. The building is lovely and historic. An old late 19th to early 20th century tenement from the working class days of Hells Kitchen. So much nicer to stay at a building with character vice another same old, same old Marriott. The location is so convenient, just a short walk to Times Square, shopping, theaters and restaurants. Subway is near by for trips up or down town. I read a few reviews where a guest said they felt unsafe in the neighborhood, not so. Not once did I feel unsafe walking day time or night. I am a 60 year old woman and was with my 15 year old granddaughter, no fear. Certainly one must remain cognizant of their surroundings and walk with confidence, but that is the best advice anywhere, not just in NYC. Our room was very quiet. We were in a garden room (partially below grade) in the back building and it is a very quiet location. Though the courtyard is right out the door for other guests to sit and enjoy, we never heard anyone being loud. Our bed was very comfortable, sleep was easy. Breakfast was continental, and satisfying. An assortment of bagels, breads, scones and english muffins with various jams and butter, cereals, juice and fruit, coffee and tea. All good. Now, to the negative: The room smelled of mildew. Not overwhelming but noticeable at all times. Now, I think this was because NYC had just received days of heavy rain, way above normal, and with this being a below grade room, it would take time to resolve. The in room ductless air system temperature was turned very low when we entered, to 62 degrees, and I think this was in an effort to try to dry out the dampness as fast as possible, but to no avail. The room was small, but this was expected and perfectly fine. We had enough space. It has seen better days and is in need of a in depth cleaning and update. Surface cleaning was being done, meaning, the tub, toilet and sink were clean, and the linens, but every where you looked you noted dirt. Baseboards, not wiped in months, heavy dust. Even the tops of each wall and outlet plate, never wiped, evident dirt. You could feel it, you could see it. The I assume granite counter tops were beyond help. Possibly because they were never resealed, but ring marks and high wear evident. An overall dog eared appearance. It would seem that for not a very great cost, management could reinvest some money to update (and deep clean!!!) and have a true gen in the heart of midtown. It is very reminiscent of bed and breakfasts that I stayed at in Europe, small and intimate, and if only given a bit of TLC (and again, cleaning) well it could be a WOW!

It's now updated with many working outlets! Also the breakfast and social hour are still there and still pretty good quality. And the rooms are still a fairly big size compared to a lot of other New York hotels. My only complaint is the stairwell in the back. I had to walk up to the fourth floor, which was tiring enough after a long day of walking, and it was just so warm. I'm not sure if this is because of the sky window or if there's actually no air conditioning up there. Also I agree with another review, the garden needs some work.

The hotel wants to be an upscale boutique hotel, but it needs to do some work to attain that status. For example, the first time we used the toilet, it would not flush. The bathroom had no fan, and in a tiny hotel room this is something that should definitely be in place. The hotel provided Q-tips, but after the four days they were gone, but never refilled. One morning, housekeeping left two conditions instead of a shampoo and conditioner. The patio could have been an inviting place to sit and relax, but no plants were growing in the numerous pots around the patio. The scaffolding on the patio was in place because of construction next door, but it would have gone a long way to making the patio inviting by simply putting some shade loving plants in the pots. I had a couple of questions for the staff, but on two different occasions they never got back to me when they said they would.

This is not the case; it's important to appreciate the 414 for what it is. The rooms are fine, but will not knock you out. The continental breakfast is fine, but not anything special. The little courtyard is nice, but this is not Seville or Marrackech.

My wife and I stayed here in April on our honeymoon to the United States, and were drawn to 414 by its location within the city (Hell's Kitchen - well placed for getting around), and for the excellent feedback that it had drawn in its guest experience.We were not disappointed in the slightest - a warm welcome from Emmy and the team was followed by the delightful surprise of a bottle of sparkling wine and some chocolates in our room - not only had the hotel been able to fulfil our request for a top floor room, but they'd also marked our anniversary date and we were touched by their generosity.The room itself was pleasant and more than adequate in size, we found ourselves able to sleep comfortably there, with little disturbance whatsoever by any noise from the city, or from other guests. As a top floor room, it might be troublesome for those with reduced mobility or lots of luggage (no lift in this townhouse building), but we managed well enough.Before we ventured out into NYC, the hotel was able to give us advice, information, a transport map, and even respond to our queries about different experiences or ideas that we'd seen or considered prior to arrival. They even pointed out a serviced laundrette about 5 doors away (after a week of travelling this was welcome), and the same day service offered there was both affordable and convenient.Breakfast is also a real treat at 414, and whilst not a 'hot' offering, it is substantially provided for with cereals, breads, bagels, preserves, yoghurts, and fruit - accompanied by tea, coffee, juice and water. All included in the room rate, of excellent quality and much appreciated - only advice would be to avoid 8-8:30 as limited seating makes it a squeeze! Another little touch, and enjoyed by ourselves on our return from forays into the city), was the ability to make a coffee in the hotel foyer - no facility in the room, but I think I actually prefer this option, as you end up with a better drink, and a chance to socialise.On departure, we were concerned on getting to our airport hotel at JFK, and didn't fancy trying public transport for this, as we weren't too sure how easy it would be for the last leg at least. 414 did us the courtesy of approaching a private hire firm (sadly I've forgotten their name), and booking a car to come and pick us up - with an indicative price offered there and then, so no taking a chance with NYC taxi cab meters in traffic (a good job, as there was a lot of traffic!). Just another example of what the team at 414 are willing to do to make your stay stand out - they really did go the extra mile for us, and we won't forget them.

Also the previous owners Susan & Andrew were gone. However Susan popped in while I was there and it was nice to see her. The staff is always welcoming and helpful. Thank you, Jacqui, Emmy and Ashley. The room was a step down on the bottom floor but because of the scaffold no light was able to get in. I would recommend a room on the 2nd or 3rd floor of the back unit.

The beds and pillows were very comfortable, this is very important to me and I wasn't disappointed at all. Room 203 can be a little noisy, as it's on the street and just above a very small bar, and a couple of times I couldn't get back to sleep as people were out the front talking at 3.30am, which was a bit annoying.

I have never been able to stay in New York City longer than 24 hours until this trip. You see, I have difficulty sleeping with a lot of ambient noise. On my one other previous trip to the City, I was on the 23rd floor of a prominent hotel on Times Square and it was a horrible experience with traffic noises and sirens all night. Also surprising to me, I found it very claustrophobic among the skyscrapers with only a thin strip of sky visible overhead. It ruined the City for me......... until now.414 Hotel is another rare example that goes into my “gets it right” column. First off, you should not expect the usual large lobby and big crowds usually found in big city hotels. This is a great example of a small, quaint European hotel translated into a rather suppisingly quiet area of Hell’s Kitchen in Manhattan. You CAN see the sky, in that the surrounding buildings are lower- not skyscrapers.At recept, you are warmly greeted by Jacque, he general manager and also will get to meet Ashley, the affable evening manager. They both exude a genuine concern for the comfort and enjoyability of your stay. The hotel was rendered from a tennament built in 1925. In there hotel information, they are upfront about the fact they have no elevator, but knowing this ahead of time they were able to accommodate me with a first floor roomThe rooms are neat and clean . Some thought has been put into the features of the room— for example, I have to use CPAP for sleeping and they have a plug-in station on the bedside table with multiple ports available. This avoids the usual moving of furniture and even the bed, I have had to undergo at some of the more expensive luxury hotels in which I have stayed in th past. Also, they have a modern bedside phone that incorporates an alarm clock and multiple charging extensions for most recent versions of electronics. Other amenities include flatscreen TV, fridge, a selection of snacks (for only a dollar each!), a small closet cabinet and tiled bath with complimentary toiletries which is CLEAN. A small selection of pastries, juices are available for a continental breakfast in the mornings and a wine and cheese social hour in the evenings compliments of the establishment.By the way, did I mention it was QUIET— I was able to take several naps and sleep at night with NO sirens, horns or traffic noises. Ah, what a refreshing change from my last visit! This hotel has opened up my ability to explore and enjoy this vibrant city.There are a few drawbacks— the room when I arrived was really hot, but this was remedied by cracking open the window which opens onto a small, enclosed rear courtyard. Also, the room was small, but what do you expect from a 1925 tenement.Overall, an A+ for attitude, environmental noise avoidance and a feeling of “at home” comfort. A really nice haven in the big city!","Hickory, North Carolina","mzed12007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hickory, North Carolina</strong>",24,5.0

I don't think so, unless hotel standards in NYC are much lower than in European or Asian cities. A hotel should first and foremost provide a good night's sleep, which was difficult due to the noisy neighbourhood(front room), uncomfortable bed and worst of all the inability to regulate room temperature efficiently. The hotel feels generally rather worn out and is very cheaply furnished and decorated. The breakfast is complimentary, but again lacking quality. Basically this place has potential, but needs a thorough makeover to justify the rates.",belgium,"tobias65</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>belgium</strong>",28,3.0

It definitely needs sprucing up. The radiator in the bathroom was rusty and broken. The vent in the shower was disgusting. The floor tile needs to to be seriously cleaned or re-grouted. The curtains in the bedroom are really old and stained. The room was 85 degrees when we arrived! We stayed right off of the courtyard (supposedly the quietest rooms are off of the courtyard) in room 205. The first night I was woken by someone or multiple people thumping around upstairs and this went on for hours! I finally called the front desk and complained. The noises did stop after that, but this was 3 AM at this point! We did not want to stay our second night, but we had to since we had pre-paid through Booking.com and our money would not be refunded. The second night I was awoken at 3:00 AM by an alarm that kept going off. I tried to call the front desk on my cell, but no one picked up. I couldn’t stand the noise so I went to the front desk in my pjs! The owner came back with me to investigate the noise. She determined it was not her building and called the police and eventually the alarm creased. In general, the walls are thin and the doors all close hard so you have to slam them...including the bathroom door. This hotel has potential as it has the makings to be quaint, but I don’t think there’s much they can do about the noise.

We have never encountered such a friendly and accommodating staff--Susan even went to the trouble to get some fat-free milk for my mom when she discovered they didn't have any at the time, and Jackie was very helpful in suggesting several places to enjoy a late-afternoon rooftop drink. It was also helpful to get advice and suggestions on things to do, or best ways to reach certain destinations. The wine and cheese reception was wonderful, too; we became acquainted with several of the other travelers, and enjoyed our conversations with them, and getting that bite to eat before the Broadway shows enabled us to eat dinner after the shows. The location is perfect, too. Walking distance to Restaurant Row, theaters, Central Park,Times Square, Rockefeller Center, and public transportation.

This was our first trip to the city in over 10 years and our very first time experiencing the city together so I was looking for a nice central location that would allow us to do the typical touristy things as well as experience great food and get a bit of a feel for what it was like to live like a New Yorker. I spend a lot of time researching where to stay so the positive reviews on Trip Advisor were a big part of why I selected this hotel and I can now say from first hand experience, all the accolades are well deserved. From the moment we walked through the welcoming red door, this hotel exceeded all my expectations. We felt like all the staff genuinely cared about all the guests and sincerely wanted them to have the best experience possible. Here are some of the highlights for us.HOTEL: The building is a cute NYC walkup, the typical tenement style building you see in the movies that makes you feel more like you are staying at a friend's apartment than a typical hotel. If you are looking for your typical Marriott or Hilton feel, this is not the place for you. Our room was on the 3rd floor of the main building and required a climb up 3 flights of stairs but that just added to the experience for me. The cheery red and white awnings and benches in the small entry courtyard are a welcome sight after a day of exploring the city. The main floor has a large table and a few small ones to take your breakfast or enjoy the evening happy hour. There is also a nice courtyard between the 2 buildings. The small kitchen off the lobby is accessible all day with a coffee machine that makes fantastic drinks as well as a microwave to heat up an occasional leftover. ROOM: Our room was a premium queen facing the courtyard on the 3rd floor. It was clean and quiet, nothing fancy. I appreciated having a small refrigerator in the room and dual nightstands at the bed with plenty of outlets for charging phones, etc. There was a large wall mounted television which we did not use and a wall mounted air conditioner which was working hard as it was an extremely warm week in NYC. Our bathroom had bath/ sink/ toilet all in one, not with the sink outside as I've seen mentioned in a few reviews. An additional shelf/ counter space in the bathroom would have been helpful but we appreciated the nice thick towels and eco friendly toiletries. AMMENITIES: As mentioned, there is a breakfast put out each morning. There are bagels, pastries, yogurt as well as cereal and fruit. In the evening, there is wine and brandy as well as an assortment of cheese and crackers set out to encourage more gathering. These joint social hours, combined with the friendliness of the staff, seem to set the tone for an open, family like environment between everyone. We met many fellow guests and enjoyed hearing about where they were from and what they were up to in the city. In addition to these perks, there is a daily newsletter put out for guests with weather forecasts and helpful ideas for how to spend the day. We took advantage of the free library tour and the free Friday night at MOMA, both of these suggestions were featured in our daily letter. We also made use of the complimentary umbrellas on a rainy morning. There is a selection of travel books and brochures in the lobby to help plan your day as well as a two page printout handed out at checkin with local dining recommendations. I found this to be very helpful as the number of dining choices in the area are almost overwhelming. Our favorite from the list was Pio Pio. We also tried a Brazilian restaurant, Samba, just around the corner from the hotel that wasn't featured on the hotel's list but was excellent. STAFF: This is where the hotel truly shines. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the warm and friendly Drew, who checked us in. We were tired from a day of travel and a little frazzled from a lost luggage problem and he wisely suggested a close by and delicious Thai restaurant for a quick bite that night. He always had a big smile and a friendly greeting for us each day and we looked forward to seeing him in between running off to our New York adventures. I also appreciated that upon entering our room that evening, we were welcomed with chocolates, champagne and a handwritten card from Susan, the hotel manager, wishing us 'Happy Anniversary'. Jacqui and Susan were there to welcome everyone in the morning and were both so hands on with all their guests. On our first morning, we opted to eat our breakfast outside on the bench overlooking the street and Susan promptly had a table brought out for us to eat over. Jacqui graciously provided me with some coupons for shopping as I needed to get a few things while waiting on my lost suitcase as well as some tips on where to get some basics in the area. As another example of their personal touch, my husband and I got caught in a rainstorm during a run in Central Park one morning. The hotel called our room upon our return, offering their dryer for our wet clothes.Finally I should mention how helpful Rachel was upon leaving. She arranged a car service for us to JFK and even made me a cappucinno in a 'to go' cup to take on the drive. I have never felt so cared for by the staff of a hotel. Customer service sometimes seems like a lost art but this hotel gets it and it never feels forced or insincere. Just great people who excel in their industry and seem to love what they do. LOCATION: This hotel is in a fantastic location for sightseeing but it's also ideal if you are a runner! It is less than a mile to the Hudson River greenway or Central Park, both places offer some of the best running in the city without having to dodge traffic. We were also pleasantly surprised by how much walking we did to get around as SO many things were around a mile or so from the hotel that it was just easier to walk there. We walked to Broadway shows, Grand Central, Bryant Park, New York Public Library, High Line, Central Park, Lincoln Center, MOMA and Empire State Building. At no time, either on the subways or walking back to the hotel late at night, did we ever feel unsafe. The area definitely has a more quiet, residential feel then Times Square but that is exactly what we enjoyed the most. I really fell in love with the city this trip and I think where we chose to stay was a big reason for that. Thank you so much, Susan and staff for making our 20th anniversary so memorable.Sincerely,Nicole and Jon in AZ","Tucson, Arizona","nikspartyof5</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",6,5.0

(There are even fold up umbrellas for guests)The location is great, Times Square, restaurant row and all the Broadway shows are on your doorstep and the subway is just two blocks walk. A daily newsletter gives some great ideas and money saving tips for activities in New York. All I can do is repeat the other great reviews, breakfast and happy hour are great. Both are very much a case of help your self and sit where you want/can and this is where you get talking to the other guests.

The neighborhood abounds with dozens of restaurants, both large and small, of every imaginable type of cuisine. The hotel has the most welcoming and friendly staff that my wife and I have ever encountered in our travels. Jacqui, Susan (the manager) and Drew were all very friendly and welcoming every time we came back ""home"" from sightseeing or seeing a play. Jacqui and Susan were particularly helpful and knowledgeable and gave us numerous suggestions of restaurants and other things to do both before we arrived and once we were guests at the hotel. They even give their clients a daily bulletin detailing things to do and places to go, including money saving tips for many of the suggestions. Each afternoon at 5 or so, the staff puts out wine and cheese (and some very fine single-malt Scotches and single-barrel Bourbons, I might add) for their guests. Many of the guests are from other countries, and the wine and cheese party gives everyone the opportunity to get to know each other better. There is also a small courtyard, which is a very pleasant place to have the hotel-provided continental breakfast, to savor your wine and cheese, and to just chat with the other very interesting travelers. The rooms are simple and small (as one would expect in a European-style hotel in NYC), and the beds are queen-sized, but the room and the bathroom were very clean and surprisingly quiet. We expect to return often. Thank you Jacqui, Drew, Susan and the rest of the staff.","silver spring, md","peter i</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>silver spring, md</strong>",179,5.0

The hotel even has a beautiful courtyard between the two buildings to eat breakfast and happy hour snacks that really made us feel we were far from any city. And the owner (Susan) and her staff were so friendly and engaging that we felt like we were at a country inn. Finally, while our quiet, courtyard-facing room was pretty basic, it had a modern TV, a fridge with $1.00 snacks, and it was actually larger than many hotel rooms we've stayed at in NYC.

I don't have anything overly negative to say, but I honestly am not sure why this hotel is rated this high on TA. But here are my thoughts.....Good- 1)Hotel is conveniently located near broadway, so that was a plus for sure. 2)The staff is very personable. I think this may one of the main reasons why this hotel is rated so highly. All the staff were helpful and there to do anything for you. They always had a smile when you walked in the door. The staff was outstanding.3)No street noise. We stayed in the back building and never heard any street noise. We could hear footsteps above us but luckily for us it wasn't bad at all. 4) room is fairly plain, but functional and clean.The rest:1) I guess my expectations were higher as the hotel was so highly rated on TA. We have been to NY on 4 other occasions and I wouldn't by any means rate this as the #1 hotel we stayed at in NY, and as I mentioned thats only comparing it to the 4 other establishments we stayed at. So not sure how its rated #1 or #2 in the whole city. Not the hotels fault at all, but I suggest you temper your expectations.2) The room was clean, but it was in no way the least bit luxurious. Just a basic room with some areas that looked like they could use some minor repairs or paint. Nothing that didn't work etc, just cosmetic items, but again not really what I expected.3) Although close to times square, I didn't care for this area of town. I was expecting the neighbourhood to maybe be a bit quieter, but the streets were very hectic and it was not a quiet area at all. We stayed in the mid town east area on a previous stay and found that area of manhattan to be very quiet in comparison. ( but not as accessible to times square)Thats about it. Again, I would in no way say not too stay here, but I am very surprised its rated this high on TA. I would say perhaps I could see it being rated highly for value perhaps? Maybe? but overall one of the top 2 or 3 hotels in NY, my opinion is no.","Chilliwack, Canada","wader</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chilliwack, Canada</strong>",105,4.0

We found the hotel on Trip Advisor and it didn't disappoint. The advantage and strength of the hotel is the staff. We had extensive interactions with Susan, John, Drew and Jacqui and they were superb. You are personally greeted each time you enter the premises. The staff has extensive knowledge regarding site seeing attractions, things not to miss, transportation, restaurants, festivals and if they don't know they will try to find out in a timely manner. Jacqui was able to find me hairspray in a matter of minutes in a semi emergency situation. The hotel location is perfect for walking access to Broadway shows. Just a couple of blocks walk to the Hudson River where we were able to see some Fleet Week festivities. We enjoyed interacting with our fellow travelers (international clientele) at breakfast in the morning and wine, bourbon and cheese in the evenings. As mentioned in other reviews there is no elevator but there are ground level rooms if not able to climb stairs. There is a small outdoor area in the front and also between the townhouses. The public area has guidebooks including NYC walks plus umbrellas. So great to know so you don't have to bring your own if you don't want to. This is more of a home atmosphere then a hotel vibe and we excited to feel included. FYI, mostly adult clientele but there were children who were welcomed and treasured.

Susan and her team have created an environment within this 22 room hotel, which works perfectly for any visitor looking for the antidote to the typical big, brash skyscraper option. You're on first name terms with the staff and many of the guests by day two, mainly as everyone feels relaxed and happy to share a story or an idea over breakfast or the late afternoon 'happy hour', which are both included in the price.Not everything was perfect and our room at the front of the property was noisier than expected. However, Susan listened sympathetically and managed to resolve the issue with an alternate room, with the minimum of fuss.She and team will happily offer advice and ideas, but equally take a note of places their guests have found, which weren't on their already encyclopaedic list. They even provide a welcome postal service, for those of us who still send postcards.

No, instead you will be a part of a small 22 room hotel that will feel like a community thanks to the staff and the hotel guests you will meet during the free breakfasts and happy hour. It will start to feel like home. Throughout the trip, I would say things like ""When we get back home"" when I meant to say ""When we get back to the hotel.""During breakfast, Susan and her crew will ask you how your prior day was. They will ask you what you have planned for the day, and if you tell them what you plan on doing, they will offer general tips and guidance on how to get there. For example, we told Susan we were planning on going to Central Park, and she told us she recommended taking the blue line to 72nd Street and then gave us her recommended route through Central Park. It was fantastic!You'll have a daily newsletter at your door giving you details on the weather, as well as tips on what to do on that day. For example, Friday's newsletter said the Museum of Modern Art is free on Friday evenings. On a sunny day it recommended walking the Brooklyn Bridge and on a rainy day, the newsletter had museum recommendations.A few weeks before arriving I asked Susan for Broadway recommendations and she recommended a musical called Come From Away, which my wife and I both loved. Susan was also aware that my wife and I were traveling to celebrate our wedding anniversary and they provided us with a free bottle of champagne and chocolates. On our last day at the hotel, another couple celebrating an anniversary was there and the couple's children brought out a similar gift provided by the hotel and the entire room of people having breakfast sang them a happy anniversary version of the happy birthday song. Another time, Susan asked one of her employees to make 7 more eggs as the eggs were running out and a different employee said that it should be doubled to 14 as multiple guests had still not come down for breakfast. It's the attention to small details like this that make the hotel such an awesome place to stay.You're not going to get a luxurious hotel room, but the room we stayed in was clean,quiet, had a comfortable bed, nice tv with multiple cable channels, and functioning AC. What it won't have are outrageous prices for daring to take a bottle or water or candy from the in-room refrigerator. Just $1 for whatever you take.My one gripe with the hotel? The door to our room was tough to close. Maybe it's because we didn't want to leave.",,Jerardo A,4,5.0

We were in NYC to sightsee as well as to see several Broadway shows so this location near the theater district was ideal for us. We had easy walk to the various theaters as well as short walks to the Subway stations. We also loved being in more of a neighborhood setting.The staff at the hotel were amazing! Each of them made an effort to talk with us and get to know us. They were more than happy to help plan our days and give advice for getting around. They also took care of arranging our airport transportation.We enjoyed having the included breakfast with bagels, toast, etc. available in the mornings and the happy hour every evening is a bonus! Nice to sit and relax after a long day of sightseeing.We were on the 4th floor in a Premium Queen bed room. The room was very spacious, especially for NYC. The room has a nice sized TV, a room safe, dresser with drawers, mini-fridge, closet, free wifi, and a window AC unit with a very handy remote for changing temps. Our only real drawback was we found the mattress to be overly soft, at least for our tastes. Just a heads up, the hotel does not have an elevator in the event someone is physically unable to navigate stairs. The staff was more than happy to carry luggage for people though!Overall, a great location with a really terrific staff. We look forward to our next NYC stay here.","Saint Louis, Missouri","morgey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",52,5.0

This was our third time in New York, having previously stayed at the more corporate hotels. The 414, as it clearly states, is not your typical hotel. It's not high rise, it's not corporate, it's not even that hotel-like in many respects.What makes this place is the hospitality. During our stay we were looked after by Susan, Jackie, John and Drew at different times and all were fabulously friendly and welcoming.It was like having our own personal trip advisors on hand to tell s the out of the way places to visit and eat at.Each morning, a news letter was popped through the door with little tips on where to visit that day - and we took a few of them up.Don't expect luxury in the sense of what the big hotels offer. The rooms are quite basic in many respects and not what you'd call modern or polished.IN fact, when we were first shown to our room, a premium suite on the courtyard, we were both a little underwhelmed. There was a musty smell that was very noticeable when first entering, but which wasn't after a few moments. The bed was large and comfortable. There was air conditioning and a heater, an iron and ironing board, plus a TV and fridge.The bathroom comprised a shower over the bath tub, plus a WC. The sink was outside the bathroom, in the bedroom, which is a little difficult if you need a little privacy (even after 28 years of marriage).But all of that said, it didn't in any way detract from the experience.We've stayed in the big hotels in New York - 56 floors up, but never have we felt like it was returning home each night. It's hard to explain how they achieve this, but i think it's just that everyone takes an interest in you.A continental breakfast is served in the lobby each morning and this is where it gets interesting. You find yourself talking to people - not only the staff, but the other guests. You share experiences, get to learn more about the places to visit.Not once did anyone say to us, go to the top of the Rock, or the Empire State Building. Instead, we took a less travelled path and visited the High Line - a park made from the old raised train line that ran through the meat packing district.We went to the Tenement Museum and ate at places we'd never have dreamed of going if we hadn't shared our experiences in this way.I emailed the hotel on the morning before we arrived and asked if they could arrange some flowers for my wife for the following morning.Not only did they do this, but they also played along with the moans and groans of the other guests when my wife jokingly complained that I hadn't got her an anniversary card. Then they produced the flowers and made the moment all the more special.The 414 Hotel won't be for everybody. It's clean, it's central to everything, but it lacks the bells and whistles that might be expected by some (including me usually). But I think it's all the better for it.It's the people that make this place special, so thanks Susan & Jackie in particular for all of your assistance and care during our stay.","Wythall, United Kingdom","eggbilly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wythall, United Kingdom</strong>",129,5.0

Just as important, the location is fantastic - 2 short blocks to Broadway, 15 min walk to Columbus Circle, 30 minute walk to Chelsea Market, as well as easy subway or cab accessibility to most of NY.

We were also very grateful for the morning newsletter, not only advising us of what was going on, but also the weather, which was a great help when deciding on what to wear for the day!With regard to the room, it suited all our needs and most importantly, the bed was extremely comfortable. This was a real plus for me as I have a chronic back problem. Mind you, the amount of walking we did each day, I think I could have slept propped up in the corner somewhere. Happy hour(s)!! What a very special time that was. After a hard day of sight-seeing, it was such a lovely welcome to come into a friendly atmosphere where you could relax with a drink and recount the day’s events with other guests and gain ideas for the following day. Also, the fact that it was free just blew us away, New York is rather expensive, so it was nice just to think we didn’t have to worry about paying and tipping as soon as we came back. It was like coming back home! It was at this time that our friendship with an Australian couple began and hopefully it hasn’t ended as we have already exchanged emails and have invited them over to us next year when they have finished their travels. Thank you again for thinking of us re the theatre tickets for 'Oslo' and sorting out the discounts for Come From Away which was extremely well executed with amazingly talented actors! We would love to come back to New York as we didn’t do everything, although I’m not sure when that will be possible. I really wanted to visit the jazz bar you mentioned but unfortunately we had to leave. I was very envious of Tracey and Brad as they were staying longer, and later they emailed us to tell us they had visited Harlem where they found beer at $3 a bottle! Not that alcohol is a major concern, but it would have been nice to celebrate the fact together!So hopefully, we will return to the amazing 414 hotel in NYC where the vibe is great, the staff are super-friendly and the Happy Hour is awesome! (to coin an American phrase).Lots of love to you and all your staff who made our stay one of the best we have ever encountered.","Alberobello, Italy","TheBattlePs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alberobello, Italy</strong>",100,5.0

Susan was able to get us a discount code for what ended up being our favorite show of the week, Come From Away.The hotel is within easy walking distance of practically everything. And we weren't shy about using the subway either---felt fine/safe all week! If you don't get enough walking in, the stairs to the top of the 4th floor finished our cardio workout for the day. Because we were busy in town, we never made it to any of the evening cheese and wine gatherings. I'm sure they are lovely too!

Breakfast is like being at a relatives house as everyone is chatting to each other and Susan the manager is the loveliest person who you can tell genuinely cares for her guests like they are family. Having stayed at 5 star international hotels all over the world this was certainly a different experience and one which I really loved. Also apart from the location being perfect and walking distance to Times Square etc it was very reasonably priced. 3 nights was around $1000 USD total which represents excellent value in my opinion.

Restaurant recommendations, help with navigating routes and public transport as well as suggestions which were invaluable in making our 5 days so special. Susan went beyond the call of duty when she discovered we had been disappointed with one of our sight seeing trips and arranged for tickets to be reissued for us to go again.

We don't usually take the time to write a review but our experience at this hotel on both occasions is second to none and we travel a lot. Susan (the hotel manager) is a warm and welcoming hostess, as are her lovely staff, and they all work hard to run a home away from home for all of the hotel guests. The hotel is centrally located for a walk home from the theatre but on a quiet, tree lined street outside of the noise and frenetic energy of midtown. The Hell's Kitchen neighborhood is full of great food options and there is more of a neighborhood feel than central midtown could provide. The free breakfast is excellent and the happy hour with a wide variety of alcoholic drinks and cheeses/crackers is an added bonus that you just don't see at chain hotels. The rooms are spacious and very clean and on both visits we never had any issues whatsoever; although I feel confident that if we did, the staff would have addressed it promptly. Because of the small size of the hotel, you have an opportunity to connect with like minded travellers from all over the world during breakfast and happy hour and Susan and her staff take the time to produce a daily newsletter which you will find at your doorstep each day with helpful insights into the city's tourist hotspots. We are somewhat reluctant to spread the word about this hotel because we are afraid in future that we won't be able to get a room! But we are prepared to run that risk as we feel the Hotel 414 deserves this recognition. Search no further.

The bathroom had good counter space, bath tub and was tiled. I slept well. Breakfast was a nice buffet that included hard-boiled eggs, yogurt, and breads. Susan or other managers on duty were at breakfast and helped with guests' plans for the day. They were also generous with tips for getting around and had some coupons we could use. Each morning there was a one-page newsletter with the weather and some ideas for things to do. Major tourist areas (Central Park, Times Square, Fifth Avenue) were all within walking distance (you need to bring good walking shoes to NYC!). The subway is also several blocks away.

I went and told Wes, who was working that night, and he noticed two light bulbs were out. He went to look for new bulbs. When he went to change the bulbs, something happened, and the overhead light and the lights in the bathroom didn't work at all.

It was already late, and my daughter and I were tired, so we decided to stay, and Susan voided the charge for the room for the night. The bed was really comfortable, and my daughter and I both slept great. The next morning, the super was there and fixed it immediately. At breakfast, Susan was so lovely and again so apologetic. That all being said, I wouldn't hold the unfortunate event against staying in the hotel again. Everyone on staff was so lovely and willing to bend over backwards. They were so knowledgeable about everything in NY, as I heard them telling other guests where to go, what to do, where to get free wi-fi, etc. This was a lovely little boutique hotel that really allows you to feel that you're a part of a NYC neighborhood rather than staying in a big corporate hotel in Times Square, which is only a few blocks away.

We'd lived in NY over 20 years ago, and had been back for an occasional night on business, and many times as day tourists, but had never come to the city and spent multiple nights during a vacation. We have traveled extensively, and typically select 5 star hotels, choosing 414 because of the excellent rating on TripAdvisor. We were not disappointed. The accommodations are simple and clean, and the location is excellent. The continental breakfast is plentiful (bagels, muffins, cold cereal, hot cereal packets, fruit, coffee and tea), and they never came close to running out, even though we lingered once breakfast was over. It was wonderful to be able to interact with other guests, both during breakfast and during the evening wine and cheese, where guests were so friendly that they shared the cheese that they'd purchased during an outing that day. The true highlight was the staff. Emmy, Jacqui, John, and Drew were friendly and helpful, attending to our every need. They were truly interested in our plans for the day, and often had recommendations regarding a more efficient way to get where we were going, what to see on our way, or how to stay dry on a cold and rainy day. They were equally attentive to each guest, making us all feel that we were right at home. We had a minor glitch with our room, and the way that both the staff, and Susan the manager responded was absolutely amazing. Highlights of our trip included a recommendation that we see the new Broadway Play, ""Come from Away"", which was excellent, as well as watching the taping of a scene from Blue Bloods, two doors down from the hotel, late that night on our way home. The icing on the cake was Susan's kindness in walking with us to Port Authority, as she was leaving on our last day, helping us to get our luggage to the bus.

Overall we had a wonderful trip and were very happy with our choice but I will just note down a few pros and cons for other visitors:Pros: LOCATION: Hell's Kitchen is ideally located for many of the keys NYC sights and particularly for those interested in visiting a Broadway show. The hotel is 5 mins walk from two subway stops and there is a frankly ridiculous choice of restaurants with cuisine from all around the world within a couple of blocks. Anyone slightly apprehensive about the area based on its former reputation needn't be worried as its heavily gentrified and we felt perfectly safe throughout our trip.SERVICE: Coming from London, it was refreshing to see how much better the Americans are at service generally but the staff at 414 really go the extra mile. Susan the owner is extremely friendly and personable and both Emmy and Wes were fantastically helpful and chatty (as were the other staff who's names I didn't catch!). As the hotel is relatively small, the staff do get to know you (and vice versa) and were great when it came to moving restaurant bookings, arranging cars and recommending place to eat and sights to see. ROOM: By NYC standards our room was very large, comfortable and equipped with useful extras such as a universal charging point for our phones and ipad. PRICE: New York is very expensive, especially for the British right now but compared to other hotels we looked at, 414 presents very good value for money. Cons:NOISE: Its not really the hotel's fault given the location and no one comes to NYC expecting a restful vacation but we did struggle to sleep on each of our nights there. We had a room at the front looking down on to West 46th St and although they have double glazing and secondary internal glazing, it was still very noisy with the usual sounds of NYC throughout the night. Suppose that's just the price to pay for being in the middle of the action but it would be something to consider if you are a light sleeper. BREAKFAST: Difficult to put this as a ""con"" really but the breakfast is fairly basic. No hot food but does the job if you're grabbing a quick bite before heading out. Overall we had a wonderful trip to NYC and would like to thank all at 414 for their work. Noise would be the only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars and would be happy to recommend to anyone.","London, United Kingdom","MattJMurray</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",26,4.0

The minute you walk through the door you are made to feel welcome. Susan and her excellent team take time to get to know you as a guest, you know instantly that this is more than just a hotel, they are genuinely interested in making sure you have a comfortable and enjoyable stay. Breakfast choices in the morning are delicious. You can socialise with other guests, discover NYC recommendations from Susan and meet new friends. Or if you enjoy solitude which I do from time to time being an introvert, then you are welcome to enjoy the facilities of the hotel, relax in your room or admire the beautiful front lobby whilst reading a book in front of the fireplace. Each evening 'happy hour' is provided, it's a great way to socialise with other guests whilst enjoying a glass or two of wine and a selection of cheeses to accompany. The words cosy and heartwarming come to mind, however this is not an exaggeration, it truly describes the 414 Hotel experience. The rooms are delightful, the bed is one of the best I have ever slept in, it was so comfortable. The shower is hot and extremely powerful, toiletries provided are of the highest quality as are the plentiful towels. I opted for a front facing room as I enjoy watching the world go by, however it was a quiet experience. Finally, I have been visiting New York City for over 20 years and have always opted for the same hotel, which up until recently, when it changed management, offered me warm and welcoming hospitality. I thought I would never find the same experience elsewhere, how wrong I was and how thankful I discovered 414 Hotel which from now on will be my 'home from home' in New York City and an establishment which I truly recommend. Kudos to Susan and her excellent team. ","Chester, United Kingdom","sjmcloughlin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chester, United Kingdom</strong>",12,5.0

The property consists of two 4 floor walk-ups between 9th and 10th on W 46th...22 (or 23?) rooms tops. The 2 buildings are separated by a courtyard that was in sleep mode (we stayed for an overnight this past weekend--a wildly warm couple of days in February) but we can see from the photos that it is just beautiful during the warmer seasons. We had a room in the second building with a queen size bed overlooking the courtyard. It was clean and perfect for our needs. The continental breakfast was perfect for our needs. We didn't take advantage of the evening happy hour as we had a bit of a walk to the restaurant for dinner that night, but what a terrific perk to this incredible hotel! Walking back from the broadway show later that evening took 10 min tops, and it was so nice to know we didn't have to drive back to the Island (Long Island)!

I have traveled to NYC many times and have stayed at a variety of properties throughout Manhattan. Now that I have found the 414 Hotel, I am not even close to being slightly tempted to try some of the other top rated TripAdvisor hotels. I dare you to find another hotel with a staff that will greet you with as much courtesy and hospitality throughout your entire stay. The staff was friendly, engaging and helpful with any requests from suggestions on nearby restaurants, which subway or bus to catch and the staff even suggested a running route (that took me to the High Line which is not to be missed). The 414 Hotel is the PERFECT mid-town location. My girlfriend and I walked from Penn Station to the 414 Hotel so as to familiarize ourselves with the neighborhood. During our three night stay, we found the 414 Hotel very convenient to walk to Times Square, the Javits Center, a Broadway show and a NY Rangers game at Madison Square Garden. A short walk to the nearby subway took us directly to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum. Of course, the 414 Hotel is located is the super trendy Hell's Kitchen neighborhood and is chocked full of great restaurants and bars. Central Park is an easy jog from the 414 Hotel and I had a great second run there during our stay. The 414 Hotel has the BEST complimentary happy hour of any hotel I have ever stayed at. Don't expect to see a large bottle of inexpensive wine. Of course, the happy hour and the complimentary breakfast were both great times to meet other guests many of which were international travelers. Our room was very clean, very comfortable and the bathroom amenities were very nice. The free wifi worked great throughout our stay. I will note there is no elevator in the hotel but the staff was very kind to offer to help us with our bags. Given the great food I had in the restaurants in Hell's Kitchen, I was thankful for the extra stairs to work off a few calories.Needless to say, although I do not know when my next trip to NYC will be, I know exactly where I will be staying.

All in all everything about this little star of a hotel was genuine and added to our special experience in New York City.Thankyou to everyone and we sincerely hope to return in the future; we have sung your praises constantly back home!","Hemsworth, United Kingdom","391beverleyl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hemsworth, United Kingdom</strong>",17,5.0

We were greeted at the door by Ike, the weekend night manager, who was clearly more awake than the four of us. Ike promptly checked us in, carried the bags to our rooms, and then served us a night cap while filling us in on the 414 and current events. Our first morning started with a community breakfast in the lobby featuring a self-serve espresso machine you will want to take home. Every afternoon around 5:30, the 414 sets out a generous assortment of wine, scotch, bourbon, and liquors. It becomes a focal point of the day. Guests gather in the lobby to enjoy the assortment, discuss the day’s events, and plan for the night. Every evening, after returning from touring the city, we were greeted by Drew, another of the 414 night managers. Drew was always willing to share in our experiences and offer us another night cap. The hotel is a short walk to mid-town and the theater district. Rooms are spacious, cozy, clean, and inviting. What more can you ask for. The 414 is everything they claim to be and more.

The knowledge of the staff led by Susan Yates is extremely helpful for their guests. We have been to NYC a few times over the years and we were looking for new places to eat and visit. Suggestions were aplenty for both local restaurants and sightseeing options. It is really helpful that Susan has provided a 3 page listing of local restaurants and then assists guest to refine the list further. With respect to sightseeing, they recommended some of the usual sites, but really helped get us to the right ones at the right time. In addition, they provided directions for both bus and subway (including maps) directions to and from the hotel. As it turned out we used the bus (get the 7 day unlimited pass for the metro at $31) more than the subway as it was at time more convenient and required less steps up and down stairs (knee issues).Our room was at the back of the courtyard and included a king size bed, dresser, etc. It was comfortable and warm for the cold days and nights. I would recommend the addition of Directv HD service given the money spent on large screen tv's as the cable quality was poor and several channels flickered and sound buzzed, but I have to say we only used the tv for late evening news.Perhaps the best part of the stay at the hotel was getting to know the hosts and the other guests at the hotel. We met couples and single travelers from the UK, Australia, Baltimore, Boston, Wisconsin, Orange County California and Indonesia. The conversation at the morning continental breakfast and evening happy hour (cheese, wine and spirits) was very engaging.

Our room was an adequate size and clean and tidy with windows onto an internal courtyard and an en suite bathroom. Slight niggle that there was no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, but there were always hot drinks available at reception. But there was free WiFi.The staff were very friendly and helpful, with lots of tips of places to see and eat, and things to do. The breakfast which was included in the price was a cold buffet with cereals, toast, bagels(assorted types), and hot drinks. Breakfast is served in the hotel reception which has one large table and several smaller ones, it could get a little busy but it works.The unique selling point which sets the 414 hotel apart from the more typical offering is the ""happy hour"", actually longer than an hour when a selection of wines and spirits together with cheese and biscuits are set out in the reception area for the guests to help themselves and to sit and socialise with the other guests.

We recently had 5 nights at 414Hotel and I cannot praise Susan and her 414Hotel Family enough. I am a Travel Agent in Australia and I chose this hotel for my first visit to NYC. It was the smartest thing I could have done for us. The hotel is in an advantageous position - so close to many great eateries, the theater district, Times Square and the subway. We chose to walk (we are walkers!!) and found most ""to do's"" able to be reached by foot which really made us feel like New Yorkers. We used the subway from JFK to the hotel - I had contacted Susan prior to our arrival to seek transport options this option is highly recommended! Ike greeted us around midnight like it was 9.30am and could not have been more helpful. Yes the hotel is all stairs (no elevator) and we were on the 4th floor (courtyard facing) and Ike carried our luggage to our room. It's really no issue. Our room was really comfy, quiet and welcoming. We immediately felt right at home. The next morning we had the absolute pleasure of meeting Susan - she is hospitality personified. I could write a whole paragraph just about her! We loved seeing her each morning as we discussed our options for the day and relived the day before with Susan and other hotel guests. What a treat - so many like minded people to share stories with! A ""newsletter"" was left under our door on a daily basis with hints and did you knows - such a great idea. Drew greeted us late every evening with his beaming smile as we returned from our adventures, never too busy to hear what we had achieved - he was genuinely interested. Most of all we felt valued and not like a number (generally that's what you are in a large hotel). We shall return to NYC again and wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.

Though I had read on their website that they don't have an elevator I was under the impression that their buildings were two-stories tall. They are four-stories and I was originally booked on the top floor. I explained that there was no way I could possibly negotiate four flights of stairs because of an acute exacerbation of a back condition and because of really bad knees! The desk clerk was able to move me to the second floor, which was fine. Unfortunately I had an awful first night because of noise from a business in the building immediately adjacent to that room. I called the front desk to ask what was going on. It was about 2am and the woman who answered the phone was as chipper as if it were 10am! The noise abated for awhile but then came back. By that time I really too exhausted to talk so I just waited it out. Normally I would have demanded a refund for the remaining nights of the stay and moved to another place. But before I could do anything, Susan came over to see me the moment I dragged myself to the lobby for coffee. Her apologies were profuse and accompanied by an action plan: she would comp my room and have me moved to a quieter part of the hotel. As much as it pains me that she has had to bear the brunt of the thoughtless landlord and even more thoughtless tenant, both of whom cause her so much grief, I accepted her plan with gratitude.The breakfast was good though I would have liked more options that didn't contain sugar. For example, at the time of my visit they had lots of yogurts but they were all fruit flavored. On the plus side I had forgotten how much I love cottage cheese! In the evenings they offer not just wine but a variety of spirits as well. While I did appreciate the quieter second room, I have to be honest and say that I was a bit stunned to find that it didn't have a chair, while the first room had two. That was remedied when I purloined a side chair from the front house. It wasn't as comfortable as the nice upholstered wing-back but it was fine for my needs.I've stayed all over NYC in all sorts of places but for as long as I am able, this will be my home each time I visit.","West Hollywood, California","MissTBlu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Hollywood, California</strong>",48,5.0

The rest of the hotel staff reflect the warmth and hospitality of its owner. We found all of them to be delightful people who were so interesting to talk to. The location near the theater district and a few blocks from Times Square in midtown was PERFECT. The fact it is just off the beaten path on a quiet neighborhood street makes you feel almost like a local. The common area for breakfast and happy hour was a nice opportunity to meet and chat with other guests, who all seemed like genuine people who know a good value when they see it.

Everything about the hotel is perfect. The 414 is a lovely, late Victorian, red brick building, converted from a pair of town houses, incorporating an attractive inner courtyard. The bedrooms/bathrooms are large by New York standards. Breakfast is traditional New York fare (bagels, muffins and the like), and the hotel has a ""happy hour"" in the late afternoon/early evening with complementary wine & cheese.The hotel is situated on 46th St. just off 9th Avenue, in what was traditionally referred to as the ""Hell's Kitchen"" area of Manhattan, (but which has more recently been called Clinton). The hotel is thus within easy walking distance of the attractions of Mid-town, such as Times Square, yet because it's in a residential area, it's quiet in the evening. The nearest subway is 5 minutes walk on 44th St.The Manager Susan, and her staff are wonderfully helpful with practical advice on how to get the best out of your time in New York - everything from how to negotiate the subway system, to getting discounts when booking theaters and museums. One very useful feature was a guide to the restaurants near the hotel. Many of these restaurants weren't traditional tourist traps, often being frequented by local New York people. We went in several - the food was always excellent, and prices very competitive.Quite apart from being the perfect base from which to explore the great city of New York, you will not find a hotel more welcoming and helpful than the 414.

Having lived in Hells Kitchen back then, I was curious to see how it had changed, so I chose this location for that reason and great reviews on TA. So this hotel is quaint, small, and friendly; a welcome alternative to the chaotic NYC scene. So it was nice to return to this relative island of peace and tranquility every evening. The good things:Very clean and comfortable travelers style hotel, with very friendly helpful staff.Rooms are up at least one flight of stairs, are very comfortable and adequate, quiet and clean.Tiny lobby provides breakfast, complimentary drinks and cheese/cracker apps.You can meet people in this quaint environment from all over the world, as well as local folks who traverse the bridges primarily to atttend the theatre.Walking distance to Theatres and midtown a big plus if this is one of your requirements.The not so good.Hells Kitchen, at least this part well north of the many developments going on around the High Line, remains a rather bleak and dense part of NYC. Streets are still laden with trash (trash bags piled on side streets almost nightly) and proximity to Times Square makes it a rather bleak neighborhood compared to others where density and proclivity of tourism is less. Although some newer and good restaurants are nearby, certainly the restaurant row restaurants cater to those who for the most part, dont know any better or defer to options near shows they are attending. Bottomn lineIf you want to be close to theatre district and like a small scale and friendly place where you can meet others and get help from friendly staff, then by all means check out Hotel 414. However, if you want a place with more amenities, care less about being in this part of Manhattan and getting to know fellow occupants, there are many other options out there that would be better option for the money.

One suggestion I'd make when staying here & returning to the hotel after a day sight-seeing via the sub-way, is when you come out onto street level, you are usually on 7th or 8th Avenue. So if you're not keen to run the gauntlet of the congestion of crowds at Time Square, which is 24/7, try walking up to 9th Ave & to E46th Street & the hotel is just around the corner. Also, on the corner of 46th & 9th is a diner, serving excellent meals (highly recommend the pot roast) & on the opposite side of the road is a laundromat, where you can leave your laundry for collection later. They offer both machine dried & hung dried, the cost is very reasonable & worth the connivence.

Susan and her husband Andrew are leading her hotel with a lot of engagement and motivation. Especially Susan is always open and friendly to support you or give recommendations. It was so nice chatting with her about all the sightseeing options you have in NYC. Beside this her staff is also very friendly and professional. Absolutely remarkable is the breakfast. We liked most the swiss coffee machine which offers all choice of coffee: cappuccino, espresso, café crema, etc. Having such a good coffee was always a great start into the day. Also the other stuff they offered was of excellent quality. And also remarkable, when you had finished breakfast you did not have any garbage on the table. Everything (except the butter :-)) was offered on plates, in cups or bottles. So significantly different than in other hotels offering self service breakfast. The hotel has a small patio and we loved it having our breakfast outside in the patio.So next time in NYC we definitively will stay again in 414 Hotel!","Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany","norbertr14</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Villingen-Schwenningen, Germany</strong>",0,5.0

The room we had was nicely appointed and a nice size. I generally have sleep issues and a good bed is important to me. My daughter and I thought the bed was very comfortable. We had a refrigerator in our room stocked with a water and a few sodas. These only cost $1.00 each! It was also nice since we could bring a ""doggie bag"" home from dinner and keep the food for later. A continental style breakfast was complementary. They provided hard boiled eggs, yogurt, breads, muffins, bagels, cream cheese, cereal, granola, fruit, juice and milk, etc. The coffee was delicious! This alone saves you a lot but later in the day they provided a happy hour with complimentary wine, cheese and crackers complimentary as well. The special coffee machine was available in the lobby day and night along with a few snacks (yes, complimentary). Being in New York, security was important to us. This property has staff at the desk 24 hours a day to buzz you in. Awesome! Best of all Susan and the staff were so helpful and gave us lots of tips to make our visit better. For example we planned on walking the Brooklyn Bridge and they suggested we walk back instead. Why? Because of the better view! When we checked in the hotel provided us with a list of restaurants nearby. They only recommend restaurants they have tried themselves. We tried a couple of them and they were excellent! That was such a nice list to have because sometimes we were too tired to go far but wanted a lovely dining experience.There were people from all over the world staying in this hotel while we were there. This reminded us of the many small hotels we have enjoyed while in Europe. That is exactly what we had hoped for our trip! Can't wait to go back, but this time in the winter or fall so we can experience the fireplace in the lobby.

What truly stands out, though, is the friendly professionalism of the staff: Emmy (whom we never met but helped over the phone with our initial reservation details), Michiko who welcomed us upon arrival, Drew who warmly greeted us on our return at night, Jacky who gave us detailed directions upon our departure for LaGuardia--and of course, through it all, Susan at breakfast each morning, looking after her guests attentively (and unobtrusively), with a genuine desire to help each visitor have a great day enjoying the city.

We were laughing as soon as we walked in the door, and included in an ongoing information/welcome chat from the staff member on duty. There's a kind of camaraderie at this hotel which is unusual - the staff and guests chat, encouraged by the details in the daily newssheet that tells you the weather outlook, ideas for sightseeing each day (e.g. what museums are free or what tours are going on) and even what nationalities the hotel is accommodating that day. They let you borrow stuff you forgot/couldn't bring (umbrellas, bikes and picnic blankets) that means you save a bit of money too.The hotel is small and on a quiet street in the middle of Manhattan, close to many sights and walkable to the nearest subway (about 3 or 4 blocks). We stayed in two rooms (we stayed on different occasions during our trip) and found each to be spacious (come on, how big a room do you expect for an urban megaville?) with a comfortable bed, aircon, fridge with snacks etc etc. If you need total quiet to sleep you might need to switch the aircon off at night. There's a good choice of continental breakfast options and a small kitchen you feel free to use if you need a drink etc. It's not fancy or luxurious (if that's what you're after you might want a more expensive option) but if you want friendly, clean, informative and not going to break the bank, consider this place.The staff were all well-trained, really friendly and helpful to guests - no weak links! Staff are on duty all night so you don't feel like you have to sneak in if you are out late :) There's no elevator but staff were always quick to offer to help with luggage so don't let that put you off. The most exceptional thing about the 414 Hotel was the way in which the staff are willing to help you plan any kind of excursion/trip during your stay. They don't just thrust a map at you like many other hotels, they ask what you are hoping to do, and suggest the best ways of getting there, what public transport to take, options for discounted tickets and even if the weather might affect your plans. It's judged well; they aren't nosey or too inquisitive, but offer genuinely helpful insider knowledge that improves your own plans.

We often go up for day trips, but this was the first time we stayed the night and I was looking for an interesting place to stay, close to Midtown, rather than a large impersonal hotel (even though some of those can be nice, too). After much research and checking out reviews, my top two choices came down to the French Quarter Apartments and 414 Hotel. They were both in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, so close to Midtown but a bit off the beaten path, in a more residential, slightly worn area. 414 turned out to be a perfect fit for us - we didn't even mind the 3rd floor walk-up room we had, which was comfortable and clean, and the area is quieter at night than other parts of the city. The staff were wonderful and friendly, allowing us to drop our bags off in the morning before check-in, and keep them there the next day until we left for home later that afternoon. The breakfast was just right and it felt homey and comfy w/o feeling crowded. The owner showed my daughter some picture books about NYC and another staff member helped me figure out how to get down to the Lower East Side via subway. The night staff person was lovely and recommended a great take-out pizza place a few blocks away (Two Boots) because my daughter was too tired to go out for dinner. If you like interesting, intimate, and down-to-earth, then this is the place for you. If you prefer an elevator and a Midtown location, I'd suggest the Archer Hotel.

My fiancé and I were planning a visit to get married at City Hall and couldn’t get a phone or email response from the marriage bureau regarding the fact that we would need a witness as we were traveling alone. I contacted Susan at 414 to see if she had any info on this topic and without skipping a beat she offered to act as our witness in the event we could not access one at the marriage bureau. Seriously!? Have you ever been to a hotel where the owner/manager would offer to take part in your event or activity to ensure that it came off perfectly? Turns out we finally heard from the city that a witness could not be provided, and Susan did take time out of her busy schedule to travel to the Manhattan marriage bureau and act as our witness. She waited patiently as we worked our way through the process, provided her documentation, witnessed the ceremony, shed a tear of joy with us, took pictures, and hugged us both with the warmth and caring of the dearest of family members. She worked with me upfront on the planning, placing a beautiful flower bouquet in the room for our arrival, and surprised us with champagne when we returned after the ceremony. We watched each day as Susan and her staff took care of each and every guest as though they were a valued treasure. Susan gives each guest unrushed personal time, taking interest in them and their day’s events to ensure that anything she can do to improve their visit, is offered. Show reservations, recommendations on getting around the city, restaurants, sights, unique destinations, tours, coupons, you name it. Outstanding personal and professional services beyond anything we’ve experienced before.

We enjoyed a quiet New York City neighborhood experience; were offered all the amenities of a much larger boutique hotel; and basked in the personalized and friendly service of a well-managed B&B. All of this was within three blocks of Times Square – and very affordable. What’s not to like?The rooms are on the second, third and fourth floors. There is no elevator but hotel staff will gladly assist you with luggage and other accommodations.They provided a small rollaway for our grandson; delivered a daily in-house newsletter that included travel info and the home countries of guests; provided an excellent breakfast and evening manager’s reception daily; and gave us a very complete list of excellent restaurants in the nearby area (46th Street is “Restaurant Row”) including 9th and 10th avenues.But the staff is the “secret sauce”. They are on duty 24/7 to meet your needs. They truly make you feel at home – in the neighborhood!The Trip Advisor system asks about modern, dry cleaning and concierge. We answered yes to all three because the concept is ""modern"", the dry cleaning is right next door and every staff person is a concierge.Tips: Use their interior courtyard to unwind; and there is a same day service Chinese laundry next door that will deliver to the 414 gratis.","Tulsa, Oklahoma","Lapolla</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tulsa, Oklahoma</strong>",134,5.0

Many details had obviously been thought out and well attended to—the large, comfortable room with $1 water and snacks, the breakfast buffet (with good coffee), the generous wine time (w/bourbons, single malts, cheeses, etc).

The location is, of course, fantastic and very central to everything, including a few blocks from the main theaters. But the real charm and plus of this lovely BB is that it is small, warm and staffed with very nice, friendly and helpful people. We enjoyed chatting with other guests and staff at breakfast. Staff made great recommendations and tips. Our room, one of the few with a split king bed, was small but it was very clean and comfortable. As frequent travelers in Europe, we generally prefer small BBs with owners that provide helpful info and a personal touch.

He's not a traveler, can't handle noise, has allergies, and sleep issues. He is hooked now as am I about 414. We won't stay anywhere else. EVER!The rooms are large for NY, simple but beautifully done, impeccably clean and appointed. The front desk staff and owners cannot do enough for you. The breakfasts are lovely and the guests are interactive and friendly. We had the best wine , cheese and other beverage choices at 5:30 p every evening before the shows, then had a light bite afterwards at the Thai restaurant a half a block away.I highly recommend this hotel for single travelers too. You have all the privacy you want but also know that you can ask for anything you need, including a bit of company if you want for the breakfast and wine and cheese times. They are extremely helpful with recommendations for restaurants, dinner, shows, how to get around New York, what not to miss while you are in the great city, and tips on where to shop or find things you want to bring home.

Still close to the subway for trips to other parts of town, too. The breakfast was always perfectly adequate to start the day; we were never at the hotel during the wine and cheese so can't comment on that spread. I think what I liked most about 414 Hotel is that it has the intimacy of a B&B but the privacy of a hotel. We enjoyed chatting with other guests but never felt like we were rooming in a stranger's house. My only complaint is that our room really needed more surface space/counter space; one expects small rooms in NYC but we needed more places to physically put our stuff.

Our room was comfortable and cool and quiet. No lift, but Susan helped us with our bags herself, and there's always someone to lug them up the stairs for us.

Also there are several restaurants to chose from right by the hotel. The hotel has, as I understood, only 22 rooms.Check in late on a Saturday night was friendly, and the guy who assisted us gave us a lot of useful information.We had a room towards the courtyard which resulted in us having the curtains closed at all time for privacy. The room had a musty smell that we noticed immediately every time we entered the room (but sort of disappeared when we had been in the room for a while, I assume we got used to it...). The room had good size, and was of OK standard. The bathroom had no heating, and it was very cold to step in the shower in the morning. It was very quiet, we experienced no traffic noise except the occasional sirenes from emergency vehicles.The TV could need some tuning, we ended up not watching it as it was really hopeless to use. The room had a safe of good size, and also a mini fridge with some drinks and snacks ( each item from were only USD 1, great!!!).Breakfast was included and served in the lobby. It was simple, but quit adequate; bagels, oatmeal, fruit, pastry, juice, egg etc. In the afternoon they had a complimentary wine and cheese serving, we did unfortunately not have the chance to try this.One day they did not finish the room until after 4 pm which was kind of a drag as we had been out walking for 7-8 hours and wanted to take a nap before going out to dinner, so coming back to an unmade room was a disappointment.The staff was very friendly and nice, except from one woman who never said hi, she just gave us a hostile look every time we tried to greet her, she was the direct opposite of the two lovely ladies who we met during breakfast. All in all, the hotel offered a lot, but I found it very expensive, we paid over USD 300 per night, and the hotel was of a midrange standard.

When we arrived without my daughters case, a toothbrush was given to her straight away. When a button came loose on a coat, a sewing kit with a kind little note was on our doorstep. We were celebrating loads of family birthdays/wedding anniversary and this was a holiday of a lifetime for us and a bottle of prosecco was in our fridge on arrival. In the end we shared this one evening at the wine and cheese hour, as it was the day the hotel got to #1 here on trip advisor and instead of just wine, bubbles were provided in celebration. Just a note re noise, we were in the front building on the first floor and kept our window open, yes the bin men woke us up, but what do you expect in a city?

The rooms are not huge but ours was super clean and perfect for the three of us. Parking a little challenging but a pretty cheap (by NYC standards) lot just around the corner.

We slept well in the queen size bed and were very pleased with the large bathroom. Also, there were lots of drawer space in our room which is something we don’t usually find when we stay at hotels. (3) Security: As noted, this is a small boutique hotel away from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. The entrance to the hotel is locked at all times. You can only get in when a hotel employee buzzes you in. Now for the fun part. The most distinguishing factor about the 414 Hotel is the friendliness, courtesy and kindness of the hotel staff and owner. They all go out of their way to make you feel welcomed.

We returned last week from a 6-night stay, this time celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary. When we arrived there was a bottle of Prosecco in our room's fridge, along with two champagne glasses and chocolates. What a way to start our visit! We were delighted to see staff members Jacquie, Drew, and Mary, whom we remembered from last year. It says a lot about owner/managers Susan and Andrew that they are able to retain excellent staff from year to year. New amenities this year included redecorated rooms (some bright, cheery colors), a comfy chair in the room, good for quiet time/reading (I believe the addition of the chair came about after my suggestion for such to Susan--how's that for responsive management!), and a fancy coffee machine (which makes excellent coffee, espresso, latte, cappuccino, etc.) available to guests at all times, not just at breakfast. One of this year's treats was that Susan is offering occasional walking tours (free to her guests) of Central Park. Susan is a native New Yorker and grew up with Central Park as her back yard. As many times as my husband and I have walked through Central Park, we got so many new insights and discoveries on Susan's tour. Thank you, Susan! On one chilly morning, we returned to the 414 after a walk, and I asked Jacquie whether they had hot chocolate. No problem she said...and proceeded to make us cups of steamy, foamy hot chocolate using the coffee machine milk steamer. Yum! (A couple days later, when we came back after a show, Jacquie asked if we'd like a hot chocolate. Good memory! Good service!). Oh, and then there's happy hour--wines, whiskeys, and snacks each evening, a great time to chat with other guests (on this visit, we met people from Australia, Viet Nam, Canada, as well as the US). The Hotel 414 is in a perfect location for anyone planning to see Broadway shows; it's just 3 blocks from the TKTS booth and nearby to all the midtown theaters. It's also less than a 30-minute walk to Lincoln Center, Central Park, Columbus Circle, etc. Of course, it's close to subway and bus lines that will take you anywhere in Manhattan.

There is no lift, true but the staff are more than willing to take bags up etc. I guess though if you have mobility problems, it may not be the place for you. Rooms are spotlessly clean and large for New York - we were in a superior room. Remember most New York rooms are on the small side though. Mini Bar with really cheap items is in the room and there is also a fridge plus a safe. Hairdryer is also provided and it's a good one ladies so no need to pack one.Downstairs near their front desk is where breakfast is served in the mornings. I didn't have any but it looked fine. It's continental in style so expect pastries etc. You can do toast and take your coffee out as well. My mum and sister had the breakfast and said it was all good. Has a lovely fire roaring away too and from 5:30pm ish, they do a great happy hour of wine, spirits, cheese and crackers. It's a lovely touch when you get back from a long day of pounding New Yorks streets. Well located a few Blocks from Times Square and there are restaurants and bars right on your doorstep if you don't want to venture too far. It's near Subways too but everything is so walkable. Lastly, Susan and her team at the hotel are really what make the difference between this and other hotels. They've thought of everything, make you feel like it's your place without being too intrusive and really couldn't be more helpful. They are faces in what can be quite a faceless city.

We had chosen to stay there partly because of its central location, and partly because of the many top reviews on Trip Advisor, and it proved to be an excellent choice.As many other reviews have already said, Susan, Andrew and the team are exceptionally hospitable, friendly and helpful hosts, and the welcome we received was second to none. Whilst 414 Hotel may not be the ideal choice for those seeking modern, five star facilities, for guests who value the personal touch in a small, traditional hotel, it is a great choice. Our room was spacious and spotlessly clean and the breakfast choice was varied and perfect for our needs. Other touches, such as the evening ‘happy hour’ of complimentary cheese, wine and spirits, and the daily newsletters with tips for guests, were very welcome. When we were there, I also mentioned that it had been my wife’s birthday a few days before we arrived, and Susan very kindly presented her with a surprise birthday gift before we left – a lovely touch.There are plenty of restaurants and bars within a five minute stroll of the hotel, and Times Square is also little more than five minutes away. We walked to the southern end of Central Park in about twenty minutes from the hotel. We flew into Newark Airport and found the transfer into NYC by train fairly straightforward. It then took us about 25 minutes to walk to the hotel from Penn Station. However, for the return journey, we decided to book a car via the hotel reception to take us directly to the airport – the service was punctual and the driver polite.We wouldn’t hesitate to recommend 414 Hotel to others, and we hope to be able to return in the not too distant future. We had an excellent stay there.Steve","Yorkshire, United Kingdom","The_Man_In_Grey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorkshire, United Kingdom</strong>",5,5.0

After pouring over hundreds of property listings, we kept coming back to the 414 Hotel. From the moment we contacted the hotel to get additional details, we were treated as long-lost friends. Manager Susan Yates, and her delightful son Zach, answered every question we had and even some that we didn't know enough to ask! Impressed with the personal touch, we immediately made our reservation.We fell in love with the hotel as soon as we arrived. It was just as we'd imagined, but even better. Located just a couple of blocks from Times Square, restaurants, theaters, bars and shops were just steps away. We were close to the action, yet situated in a neighborhood-like setting. Our room was in the lower part of the courtyard area and was BIG and very, very quiet. We didn't hear a sound or any street noise whatsoever.Susan and her staff, especially Jackie and Drew, couldn't have been more attentive. They were available to provide directions, tour suggestions, show information and great conversation. No request was too much trouble.From the ample continental breakfast, including a nice spread and an espresso/cappuccino machine, to the warm and inviting Happy Hour reception with guests from around the world, everything was welcoming and relaxing.Simply put, I cannot recommend the 414 Hotel highly enough.","Frankfort, Kentucky","Susan H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Frankfort, Kentucky</strong>",21,5.0

We took a quick subway ride to the lower Manhattan, East Village area. It’s a short walk to the Central Park, Columbus Circle, Lincoln Center area. We also walked over to 5th Ave., Rockefeller Center and a lot more. To avoid the hassle of driving and traffic in Manhattan, we drove down the west side (Henry Hudson Pkwy, I believe). It was easy to get to the hotel, but it was clear that going any deeper into the city the traffic was heating up. We parked in the garage close by that was listed in the information we receive with our hotel confirmation. First they said the garage was full, but when I said we were staying at the 414, they were happy to park our car in the garage!

My adventure started with my friend finding the 414 Hotel by accident and it was the best accident I ever had, from the moment we arrived they could not do enough for us. We arrived at 10:40AM on a Thurs and couldn't check in but they were happy to hold our bags as we were asking about where to park (yes we drove into the city) Andrew explained that on Thursday that it is street cleaning day and everyone on the street must move there car so we may be able to get a spot on the street. Andrew offered to walk down to where we had doubled park down the street, so he walked down with my friend Jen while I waited at the hotel as I was waiting someone right in front of the hotel pulled out of there spot so Pop (hotel employee) went out with me to hold the spot while my friend moved the car into the spot, so here we are parked in front of the hotel waiting for the street cleaner to come down, Andrew also told us that we would need to stay in the car until 12:30pm or the police would have you towed, Andrew kept coming out to the car and checking on us if we wanted coffee or a snack and when the street cleaner came down the street Andrew came out and showed us what to do and how to move out into the street and back into our parking space, lets just say we experience the New York driving experience first hand but in the end we had a spot right in front of the hotel and Andrew saved us about $100.00 in parking fees so we could stay there until we checked out on Sunday. When we were able to get out of the car we went into the hotel and they had fire in the fireplace going and left over bagels from breakfast and offered us something to drink and snacks while they explained how things work in the city. Jackie who was at the front desk use to be a personnel shopper and she is a wealth for information about shopping and getting around the city, she had explained about the Big Bus (tour bus that takes you around) that was the best advised because we learned many things about the city that were would not have know walking around. If you do the Big Bus tour we did the 2 day tour and got a 3rd day free, it takes you on the downtown loop, uptown loop, night tour, boat tour all while you can get on and off at different stops (except the night tour they don't let you off because of the traffic). Jackie gave us a voucher for the Big Bus that saved us $20.00 on the tickets, she also gave us a gift card to Century City 21 (excellent shopping mall in financial district) every gift card has an amount but you don't know until you use it at the mall my was $5.00 but it could be up to $500.00. Andrew and Jackie told us about the restaurants near by as we were in Hells kitchen. We then decided to walk down to Time Square and get our feet wet with the City, when we got back they were having the wine, cheese, and bourdon something they do every night. We loved this about the hotel you sit around and share stories of your day get tips from other guests and meet a lot of great people, we meet people from Israel, California, North Carolina, West Virginia, Canada, Scotland, London and everyone was so friendly that you feel like you are at someones house party not the hotel lobby. Drew was another employee who works the night shift and he was so much fun to get to know and loves to meet new people and get there life story. We stayed for 3 days and had a great time, the next morning we meet Susan who I had heard was the owner of the hotel she was also great and I had to tell her how we had only been there one day and already felt at home, Susan told us she was giving a free walking tour of Central Park and we were welcome to join her and other hotel guests but we had other plans. Everyday at the hotel they would put on your door a newsletter about things happening in the city that day, what the temp. was and other fun facts from this newsletter we found out that on Fridays at the Museum Modern Art has free Fridays at 4pm to 8pm so again they saved us more money so in all they saved us about $150.00 in our different activities. You may notice on the hotel website that they don't have elevators in the hotel but don't let that keep you from this gem of a hotel because they have some rooms that only have a few small steps to go down and they helped us with bring our luggage upstairs. We never met the housekeepers so I am sorry to say I don't know there names but they were great and our rooms was always so clean and fresh. The hotel is immaculate and they have coffee, tea or hot coco all the time. There was a great coffee machine in the kitchen that makes Cappuccino, latte macchiato, or Espresso which was just what we needed when we got back in the afternoons. We ate at the Galaxy Dinner and the Bare Burger both about 1 to 2 blocks from the hotel every good meals, we ate at the Bare Burger twice because we liked it so much. Pros Everything Cons None in my experience. I would stay here again in a heartbeat, one more thing that I liked was that this hotel is close to everything but far enough away from the chaos of Time Square.","Virginia Beach, Virginia","ChristineW652</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia Beach, Virginia</strong>",11,5.0

I will say right off the bat, that I much prefer small hotels. Why? Because service is almost always far better. But most importantly, you meet people, you have conversations, and usually make new friends. The 414 is not the place for you if you prefer to remain anonymous, and only deal with the front desk. However, if you enjoy a great (and included) breakfast while conversing with travelers from England, France, Germany, or Australia, maybe this is your place. And if you enjoy a happy hour discussing the day's events with your new friends, then you'll love it. By the way, the happy hour is more than an hour, includes Bourbon, Irish Whiskey, wine and cheese. The owners, Susan and Andrew, will be your new friends. They could not be more accommodating.

The location makes it easy to walk anywhere in mid-town Manhattan and partake of the many theaters and restaurants in the area.

Susan and her staff know the ins and outs of what's happening each day in NYC and are full of great suggestions and helpful hints on how to maximize your stay....there's even a daily one-sheet newsletter with that day's weather and events placed on your door each morning.

We paid £2,000 for a 10 night stay. Our room had wifi, ironing board, safe, fridge, TV, lots of clothes storage space - also multiple USB chargers which were in constant use for phones, iPads etc. The cost included breakfast (tea, coffee, juice, cereal, fruit, croissants, bagels), hot drinks (tea and coffee available all day), and alcoholic drinks (there was a happy hour each evening with wines, spirits, cheese, biscuits - to encourage guests to socialise in the public area near reception before heading out for a meal) The team couldn't do enough to help the guests out. Normally one of the owners, Susan and Drew, were around each breakfast time and during the day to see what people were planning and to offer suggestions. They and the rest of the staff were always happy to book cars, reserve restaurant tables, provide directions etc We normally find we keep to ourselves a little on holidays, but on this trip we get to know several other guests with whom we shared tips on what we had done or planned to do, this made our stay feel like we were part of a community.A couple of things to watch out for. (1) no lifts in the hotel so if you have heavy bags they will have to go up and down stairs (2) I thought the bathroom needed a freshen up - including a more powerful shower. We certainly wouldn't hesitate to recommend the hotel to friends, or to go back there ourselves if we return to NY for a holiday",Southampton,"jc72</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southampton</strong>",18,5.0

Don't expect any assistance with luggage up and down them. A front facing room will, rather than offering ""quaint, tree-lined views"" as mentioned on the website, instead offer box seats to the loud and weed-smelling turkish bar next door as well as the church directly across the street, where sadly but noisily a long line of homeless will appear regularly seeking a meal. The street is their living room and their loud conversations are regularly present at all hours of the day and night, non-stop on weekends.. The street the hotel is on is raucous and tumultuous day and night, so insist on a courtyard room or bring earplugs. I never saw anyone to mention this to other than housekeeping until the morning of our third day at the property; when i did speak to the manager she was condescending and sent me a letter suggesting it was my error in not booking a quieter room and holding her responsible for ""regular street noise"". I guess she didn't realize i was born and raised here,return often and have stayed in numerous hotels throughout the city and locally, know when i'm being shined on, and found her arguments ridiculous. Anyone spending a single day here would be well aware of a noise level way beyond ""regular"", and the website suggestion of a calming, refined location is misleading at best. My firm and resolute insistence that I be given an adjustment on my bill was granted, but not without the manager leaving me a sharp note stating that I was ""crass"" in requesting same.There are numerous small boutique hotels nearby that are what they say they are and are better.","Tampa, Florida","Unvrno58</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tampa, Florida</strong>",14,2.0

The best part about the Hotel is the warmth and kindness as the staff mingle with the guests at breakfast time, find out the plans for the day and offer suggestions about transport, things to do and the easiest way to get around. This was invaluable to me on my first trip to NYC, in which I even found some of the procedures and routines quite different to the way things are done in Australia. The other lovely thing was Happy Hour at night, when Susie and her team got our a range of spirits and wines, along with high quality cheeses, fruits and crackers, and welcomed the guests home from their busy days on the town with welcome drinks and an ear for the stories of the day. Fantastic and something I have not encountered before. It also encouraged the guests to mingle and I found I had made some nice friends, even after a day or two. The hotel is clean, the beds are comfy and spotless and with my view over a little metal balcony and leafy trees in a quiet street, I could have been in an expensive area of Paris, not a few hundred metres from the razamataz of Times Sqaure.

It started when I looked on Trip Advisor for a hotel that had great reviews. Came across this one. It was still 4 months out from my trip, so I thought I'd wait a week to book. Long story short, it filled up quickly (I now know why!) and I was so bummed. Contacted Susan in the middle of the night via email and immediately received a response. She went out of her way to accommodate me in the event of a cancellation. Woohoo! I had a room!When we arrived, Drew was most kind and helpful! Very pleasant. We felt at home right away. My friend (who won't mind me saying she is very hard to please) could not stop talking about how great everyone was and the room was perfect! We had just experienced a not-so-good taxi ride from the airport, but the hotel staff was able to make us feel better instantly.There's so much I could say, but I will run out of space, so all I can do is just hope you consider them for your stay. I am a firm believer in rewarding hard work and that tips should not be mandatory but should reward exceptional service. I could never repay them, so this is my version of a tip... and if you've stayed here and enjoyed your stay, please consider doing the same! The staff went above and beyond and they deserve all of the recognition they can get! Loved the happy hour every night (wine, cheese, etc.), loved that they include breakfast, loved that they had a private patio, GREAT location to everything, very nice-sized room and most of all, great employees. Loved getting to know Mary & Drew and appreciated so much the food recommendations and super easy directions to take the subway. Without them I would have been lost.

Susan, the owner, was so personable & welcoming, which just added to the warmth of the place.

I found the 414 Hotel and we made a reservation. When I made the reservation, I also asked if they could recommend a restaurant near the theater, as it was Saturday night. Mary who took the reservation, sent us a list of nearby restaurants. One day later, Susan, the General Manager, contacted us noting that the play we were seeing was a little further away and asked what sort of cuisine we liked. She found us a lovely French restaurant, made the reservation, and confirmed it. It made our very short trip into NYC quite a treat. As others have noted, the hotel is in a great location especially if you have theatre tickets. We had a room off the patio which was slightly below grade, so quiet, and cool.

The next Underground is located just 2 Blocks east and one block south of the hotel (so 6 - 8 min easy walk, also with luggage).

We were in New York for the first part of our honeymoon and upon arrival (feeling slightly worn out from a long journey) we were greeted with not only a lovely room on the top floor, but a bottle of sparkly, chocolates and a personal card congratulating us on our wedding. The whole theme of the hotel is personal. The staff are super friendly and keen to help you have the best time in New York. They offered recommendations for experiences and bars and restaurants all of which were fantastic, especially the roof top bar they advised us to visit with a view of the empire state. Susan (the manager) was fantastic and really made us feel at home. She also helped us with booking a restaurant and has even emailed us since our stay thanking us for our visit. Our room was spacious, with modern décor, a great sized bathroom and excellent air con. The room was serviced whenever we wanted it. Another bonus of this hotel was that a great brekkie was included. Coffee, tea, juices, water, bagels, bread, cakes, croissant, eggs etc. which was a tasty way to save money in the pricey city. Also the free cheese and drinks around 5pm was a brilliant thing to offer and gave us chance to mingle with staff and other guests. If you want your stay in New York to have a good location and a very personal feel then we would 100% recommend this hotel. Thank you to Susan and all the staff for making our honeymoon so special.

She emailed me promptly, communicated well and made us excited for our visit by telling us she couldn't wait to meet us. The location of the hotel is perfect. It is within walking distance to subway stations and tourist attractions such as Times Square and Top of the Rock. It is also close to a wide range of places to eat and shops. However the hotel is far enough away to feel like you can relax from the craziness of New York. The hotel is quiet and once inside the pretty garden feels like you aren’t in New York at all!The room was clean and simply decorated. It had everything you need. Very good air conditioning, a comfortable bed, toiletries. We also appreciated the New York guides left for guests. The room also had a mini fridge which contained cans of pop and water which could be used then added to the room bill at a reasonable price, not your usual mini bar. Our room was on the bottom floor and although we did hear people walking in the room above it wasn’t loud enough to stop us sleeping and you couldn’t hear any other noise. Facilities such as free Wi-Fi are also available. The thing that really sets this hotel apart from others is the staff. They are kind, helpful and would do anything for their guests. They take the time to get to know you and make you feel comfortable. A couple of examples are that Susan had left us a very lovely message in a card with a bottle of sparkling wine telling us to enjoy our honeymoon. On our first day in New York there was a lot of rain firstly we appreciated the hotel provided umbrellas and secondly the staff at the hotel were keen to help with organising sightseeing that could be done in the rain, they are very knowledgeable on the local area. Another member of staff who made us feel very welcome was Drew. He told us that the 414 hotel was ‘home’ and he really made us feel like it was. A nice surprise for us was the free breakfast, we didn’t realise this was available. The breakfast included teas, coffee and juices, pastries and breads, yogurt and cereal. All of a high quality. Although it didn’t affect us another guest asked for Gluten Free items for breakfast and this was provided. Between 5:30 and 7 wines, spirits and cheese are laid out for guests to enjoy. Most evenings we missed, or would have missed this as we were still out but Drew on a few evenings was kind enough to keep them out as he knew not all the guests had returned yet. I would highly recommend that anyone stay here. It was an amazing find and if we ever return to New York it will be our definite choice for a welcoming, friendly and high quality hotel.
