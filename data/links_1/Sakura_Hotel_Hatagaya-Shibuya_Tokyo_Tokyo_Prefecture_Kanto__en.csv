This is it!As a solo female traveller, I'm not the biggest fan of sharing rooms because I don't like the pressure of always being mindful of my stuff spread out in the room--for that, I always opt for getting my own room. This hotel has the best rates for solo traveling that I saw for Tokyo. So let's talk about things I love about this place.1. CostThis place is affordable, of the many locations I checked, this is one of the most affordable ones.2. LocationThe location is quiet and not on the main road which is great because it's perfect for your shut-eye. But it still remains very accessible to train stations, it's 3 minutes away from Hatagaya Station which is just two stations away from Shinjuku which means cheap train fares despite not being covered by the subway pass. It is also just 15 minutes away from the train station that is covered by the subway pass.3. Access to Food and Stores NearbyThe vicinity is also with a lot of convenience stores, hole-in-the-walls, drugstores, and restaurants. But, you need not worry about that because the hotel itself has a 24-hour cafe that is reasonably-priced.4. RoomsThe rooms are great. They're not the most spacious but I think that's the norm in Tokyo. The entrance might seem underwhelming if you're tall, but the ceilings are higher inside, I promise. :)The room is equipped with all the basic necessities you'll need, but the hotel offers more free rental equipment for other things you might need. I find that smart and considerate! Plus, I got my own room which is all that I really look for. That's a plus, yes, given most accommodations I found in the same price range has shared bathrooms.I wanna address a review I read that the toilet stinks, it's not true for me. If you smell something, just close the toilet lid and you should be good. They also offer deodorizers and humidifiers for free, if you ever encounter it.I went in the summer and their air-conditioning is perfect!5. BreakfastThe free breakfast is bread, juice, coffee, tea, and soup. Though it's the same everyday variation comes in the jams, juice flavor, and soup. But the highlight of this is the duration, they start early and end really late which is perfect if you need to leave early or just want to sleep longer and wake up late.6. WiFi and Other AmenitiesWiFi is great! It's reliable in all locations. Our Muslim friends are also considered as there is a prayer room available. :)7. StaffThis, I think is the gem of the place. For Non-Japanese, they speak and understand English! Great customer service in Japan is common, but Sakura Hotel Hatagay takes it to the next level. First off, thank you to the staff for the little things:a. Letting me get cold water in my water bottle from the bar every morning and every nightb. Helping me with my questions about getting around and how to use my subway passes together with the IC Cardsc. Giving me band-aids; this seems like a little think but I bruised myself and just needed one band-aid, buying a whole box in the drugstore seemed wasteful as I only needed one but the staff (maybe Hako, the one in your Instagram account photos) gave me two. I appreciate that very much!Most especially, I stumbled upon an issue in Tokyo and they went above and beyond to help me. Short of it is, I got left behind by my overnight bus to Osaka due to misinformation from the person who booked me. I was so tired that night, feeling lost and overwhelmed somewhere in Tokyo Station. I called the hotel and everything started to just be too much for me and started crying on the phone whilst talking to the Assistant Manager of the Hotel. I was asking them for help to contact the bus company and they were more than happy to do it for me. Filled with anxiety on the phone, they have calmed me down and offered to go back to the hotel and sort the entire thing out. They even went ahead and offered me a discounted room for the night. But since I planned to leave in the morning, they offered for me to just stay in the cafe since it's open for 24 hours. When I got to the hotel, they could not be any more accommodating and friendly towards my stressed self. They helped me just settle in the cafe with my laptop and even as far as booking a new ticket to Osaka, helping me find the cheapest rates online. That was so stressful for me as someone traveling alone, but their help made it all okay for me. I contemplated leaving the next night but they also gave me tips that there is a typhoon coming and leaving soon is a wiser decision. True enough, when I got to Osaka, a typhoon hit Tokyo which would have stranded me in Tokyo even further.To Sakura Hotel Hatagaya, thank you to the Assistant Manager who helped me and his staff on the night of September 7, 2019. I got your business cards but have not had the chance to unpack to look for them (I apologize), but I wanted to express my utmost gratitude towards your team in Hatagaya! You made my Japan experience memorable and I cannot wait to come back.",,Czarina M,12,5.0

Stuffs are very friendly. Place is close to train station and many convenient stores. The hotel food was different from what you find in local Japanese restaurant.

The people: some were chilling, some were on their laptops, some were with their group, laughing and sharing stories. Since we are Muslims, we are delighted that the cafe offered Muslim-friendly menu, properly labelled on the display. Food arrived within a 10 minutes (or less) wait.Near the toilet, a prayer room is provided- which is really convenient since the room is too small for a space to pray.After 3 PM, we checked in. The interior of the lift was too red and has a claustrophobic feel for my liking, since they used a carpeted red wall (the only part of the building that irked me).The room we stayed was one double bed, for 2 people. When we opened the door, it was only enough for the entry of one person at a time, immediate left is a mirror and a place to hang our clothes, and to the right is the toilet. You have the double bed near to the table and TV. Small space for walking but it does its job when your focus is travelling and only require the room to sleep in.Amenities like, hair dryer, slippers, towels, toothbrush and toothpaste, cups were provided.

Like, we're not picky. I tried to brush my teeth and almost hurled. After a few hours of being in our room and the smell not getting better, we asked to be transferred to a new room. At first the woman said they were full and it wasn't possible, but my boyfriend asked ""can you check?"" and the woman was like ""oh, we do have a room."" She didn't seem happy at all, and I understand that it is an inconvenience, but really if they hadn't wanted to move us they shouldn't have put us in the poo room. I did notice when we first went in the room, the window was open, so perhaps they thought it would air out before we got there, so that in itself is understandable, but the attitude wasn't cool. We got moved to a tiny room with a view of the stairwell, so we had to keep our curtains closed for privacy for our remaining 4 nights there.

This atop the Super friendly staff made me feel as if i were staying at a home away from home.Coming from a country where we have huge houses, i did find the room quite small, but then again, cant complain it being Tokyo. I actually liked the room, although it is small, it has all amenities you would need.The Food at the hotel is pretty good and they also have a wide selection of beers( Local beers and international ones).The hotel does come with Complementary Breakfast which is quite amazing considering the inexpensive price , but there is room for improvement.More variety can be added.The hotel is a mere 2 minute walk from the Hatagaya Metro station, which is one of the best things about the hotel, this makes it very accessible to any district via the metro. There are lot of Convenience stores and eateries close by too.The hotel staff are just amazing and very friendly, they were always there to help.Overall i would say this hotel has a great value for money, considering its prime location;Great for tourists who require a place to sleep after a day of site seeing.","Doha, Qatar","kamals_eye</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Doha, Qatar</strong>",1,4.0

It's value for money. The location is fantastic near Hatagaya station which is only 2 stops away from Shinjuku. The surrounding area is safe and have convenient stores and cafes/restaurants all within walking distance. The staff are friendly, helpful and able to communicate in English. We had an earthquake experience while staying here but the staff is able to explain and provide us assurance that everything is fine. My only suggestion for improvement is on the daily breakfast which could offer more variety in different days eg. oats or cereals. The room is small but then again that is expected for the price that you pay in Tokyo. Overall, this is a great place for family to stay and will definitely consider Sakura Hotel Hatagaya if I ever come to Tokyo again.",,leantengyew,0,4.0

The twin room had a double bed (which was a good size for the two of us) and a single. The rooms were small but clean and comfortable. Bathrooms are very small but adequate.
