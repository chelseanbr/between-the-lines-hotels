I called the front desk regarding immediately. She offered a room change or a change of sheets. I had already unpacked and did not want to change rooms as I was tired from completing my 14hr shift as a healthcare worker. Front desk stated someone would come change my sheets. Unfortunately, I was informed the handyman that was available could not change my sheets personally and instead would drop off the new sheets and I would have to change the sheets and make the bed myself. I had waited almost an hour for his arrival, I called the front desk twice because of this.I removed the stained sheets for the handyman to take with and noticed the blood stain had seeped into the mattress cover as well, which had to be replaced.While making the bed, I noticed I was missing the appropriate bedding. I called and requested the front desk to have housekeeping change my sheets the following morning while I was at work. I have called over the phone and asked in person numerous times to the housekeeping, front desk, and the manager about this matter each day and night that it was not resolved. I am frustrated, upset, and disgusted not only because of finding stained blood in my bed but also because no one addressed this matter sooner and it took 3 days to have this matter taken care of. It was resolved on 5/6. Is this Embassy Suites/Hilton’s hospitality and/or customer service experience?",,Sammi33RN,0,2.0

The bed was comfortable, the breakfast was delicious, the staff was very friendly, the evening reception was nice. My husband and I enjoyed our 3 night stay. The location is great. It is a short walk to so many things. Times Square is close, Union Terminal and Penn Station are within 10 minutes. I would recommend this hotel for couples or smaller groups. One thing I did not agree with is the mandatory $25 daily fee that you must use before midnight in their gift shop, bar or room service. $6 regular Kit Kat, $4 small bag of chips. Most nights we were spending it on stuff we didn't need or use just so the money didn't go to waste.Getting there... We flew into JFK, took the Air Train to the Jamaica Stop, and took the E train to Penn Station where we walked to the hotel.

Given the options in NYC, I'm not sure why anyone would eat here other than to use the $25 Urban Destination Fee, which is applied daily and can be used as a credit towards food and beverages in the hotel. However, as I said, with so many amazing dining options in the city, the $25 fee is just another tax.

The legendary omelette breakfast was terrific, but the dining areas are very crowded, with disastrous traffic flow.The location on 37th street is not great.

Huge safe in the closet. I always appreciate coffee maker, small fridge, and microwave and all worked fine.I had a great view from a high floor, and recommend paying a little extra to get that. You'll feel less claustrophobic. The mandatory $25/day fee seems to be taking hold at many Hiltons in Manhattan. You can't accumulate but must spend each day. You can buy from a limited selection at the snack counter or use at the bar/restaurant. But you pay tax and tip at the latter and that doesn't count. I'm told this fee also doesn't count in base points for HIlton Honors.

Such a shame to have a lobby and can not use as much as should be used.

I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but the evening reception and cooked-to-order breakfast both sounded enticing. Some good points - I liked the location. Away from the serious hustle and bustle of Times Square, but a short walk to loads of points of interest or the Subway. The hotel was very busy with long lines to check-in, but the concierge soon called me over to his desk to check in there instead. The evening reception is a nice idea, but it's much less than an executive lounge you'd find in some Hiltons. There were a few bar-snack nibbles, and drinks on offer - not quite sure what was included, but I had a beer so I know that is. It was very busy and noisy, with few seats available, so we only stopped for one quick drink on one night. Breakfast was really good - nicely cooked and a good selection. The staff were also working hard to keep tables clear. The space is quite small, however, and the hours quite limited - 06:30 to 09:30, with warnings that it's extremely busy towards the end of service. We 'chose' to wake up extra early every day to avoid the crowds. It's all a usual buffet, apart from eggs and omelettes which are cooked fresh - which is what most hotels offer anyway. I was only here for two days, but each day the breakfast choice was slightly different - a very nice touch. The room was comfortable and clean, although the bedroom itself is quite small - just enough room to open the door before you hit the bed. The bathroom is nice and spacious, however. The whole hotel is very modern and clean. Long wait to retrieve our bags when leaving, so we ended up just having to go into the bar area where they're stored to retrieve ours.Generally, I got the feeling there aren't quite enough staff or facilities for the number of rooms or guests. The breakfast and evening reception should possibly increase the hours, so that there's less of a crush at peak times.Overall - not a bad hotel at all, just not quite what I'd expected or hoped for.

Unfortunately there were no rooms in the (massive) host hotel, so I had to find another facility. I saw ""Embassy Suites Times Square,"" on the Hilton Site, so I registered there.When I arrived, I was at first struck with the fact that it is actually no where near Times Square - over a half a mile away. This eventually became completely inconvenient, and really represented nothing less than false advertising.Upon arriving, I learned that there is no valet parking offered, which was a first for me. So I had to unpack my bags, leave them in the lobby where I was told they would ""be OK,"" and was given the wrong directions and wound up in the wrong garage. There was no ""handout,"" telling you the address of the garage or more efficient directions, just verbal directions from a friendly desk person who unfortunately was not a New Yorker.When I arrived, I then learned there was a major problem with my booking. Apparently, I was booked to arrive the night before. Although this may have been a mistake by my staff, there was little of no attempt by management to assist me. I was initially told that it would be removed from the bill, but later was told that was not correct, that I would be billed for it, and that there was ""nothing the staff could do."" This was from a very nice desk person who had no authority to assist in any way. No one from management ever contacted me to discuss the situation with me or give me any further advice.So after I got to my room, I put the ""Do Not Disturb,"" sign on for a half hour. As the result, I could not get my room serviced for the next two days. On both days, I had to go down to the front desk to ask that my room be serviced.In terms of the ""free breakfast,"" yes it is offered, and one morning when I went early was able to enjoy. But as many other things about this hotel, it is poorly organized, such that from 8AM on it is too busy to actually be able to take advantage of this benefit.It is ""Embarrasing,"" that such a facility by associated with the Hilton organization.There were other problems, but I cannot bother with some of them","New Hartford, New York","Frank B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New Hartford, New York</strong>",6,1.0

Because it's Manhattan, the closet was small and stuck in the bathroom, and the only drawers to put away clothing were under the bed, but overall I tend to anticipate these type of modifications in Manhattan.I was not able to enjoy their breakfast secondary to my early morning departure from the hotel, but I did stop by their evening reception each night on the 4th floor. There was always a nice array of chips, dips, and a crudite. The bartenders were friendly, and poured a nice complimentary cocktail. Of note, you can choose to upgrade to some top shelf cocktails and wine during the reception. I found the complementary offerings quite satisfactory.Lobby was welcoming, and there was always a couple of containers with very fresh fruit waters, sometimes with cucumber sometimes with mixed berries, and once with fresh pineapple.

The walk is doable to this hotel both from Grand Central and Penn Station. We prefer Penn Station, but a taxi will get you there in no time. The front desk is friendly. There is no problem if you need to store your gear before or after your hotel stay. I did inquire about having a “fan,” as I like the noise and circulation. This hotel does not carry fans. The AC system is cold enough to your liking on those hot days in NYC. The room is smaller than your normal Embassy Suites due to location. The comfort you expect is quite evident with comfortable beds and a modern bathroom. There is even a small refrigerator. We stayed at this Embassy twice over ten weeks. Both times we selected a room “with a view.” Our first experience we were on the 38th floor with commanding views of the Empire State building, World Trade Tower in the distance and you could see the largest store in the world—Macy’s—down below. It was quite an experience to view a storm coming over NYC. We felt totally safe.Our second experience was not so thrilling. We were placed on the 24th floor facing a building. One of the highlights of all Embassy’s is the breakfast. Jorge cooks one superb omelet and even better “eggs over easy.” An Ecuadorian, he is indeed friendly. I am so glad that the computer machine on the wall was not working on our second visit. You could actually converse with Jorge. Ordering by the grill is much better than the computer on the wall. Breakfast has all your favorite meats—bacon and sausage—and different types of cereals and yogurts. It did not have, though, hard boiled eggs or even poached eggs—my wife’s favorite source of protein. I brought this fact up to the manager who called the kitchen. She learned that they do not cook these styles of eggs. The Managers “Happy Hour” is well attended. For a solid two hours, beer, wine and many cocktail drinks are on the house. You may not get a seat if you get there too late! If you are not so lucky, the ice-machine may be on another floor. This can be a hassle. The elevators for the most part, are quick. You may have to wait longer for one of the four elevators in the morning. Overall, we were pleased. The hotel is centrally located to many attractions and to metro stops. You can get a comfortable night’s sleep. The only major complaint is they don’t have my wife style of egg’s—which is commonly carried In Hampton’s and many European style hotels.","Jensen Beach, Florida","Marty B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jensen Beach, Florida</strong>",3199,4.0

However, this stay got off to a bad start from the beginning. When we checked in, the front desk clerk said they were overbooked and we couldn't have a suite (which is the entire reason we wanted to stay there). We agreed to just have a King bed instead (really no choice). The clerk said we could switch after the first night to a suite, but we were going to be gone the entire day so when would we even have been able to switch? It was just too much hassle. The next day when we came back around 7:30pm, our door was propped open (I assume by housekeeping). We walked in and luckily nothing had been stolen, but of course I made a complaint to the front desk about it and told them to let the manager know. I didn't receive any other communication from them during our stay. The other reason we stayed there was because of the free breakfast, but each day we tried to go it was a literal madhouse; you could barely squeeze by and get your food. It was like the entire city of New York was trying to get breakfast for two hours. We gave up after the first day and never went back. We won't stay here again; the prices were higher than comparable other Hiltons in the area, and attempting to get a free breakfast as part of the deal just wasn't worth the higher price.

Here's the short version, save yourself and don't stay here. If you need to know why I would say that, you can read this long post.Hotel staff checked us in early but didn't have rooms ready. They told me that they would call me when it was ready, but they never called.Arrived back at hotel after a day on the town and ready to clean up for dinner. Luckily, I was given our keys and told our two rooms were all ready. Then we were introduced to the elevator situation at this hotel.The hotel has three very small elevators and about 40 floors. The elevator fills up very quickly and then stops at almost every floor because people are stuck and can't get on the elevator. Our first trip up the elevator took 15 minutes, literally. By the end of our trip, we would jump on the elevator going the wrong direction and ride it up 10 more floors, with multiple stops, then ride it back down just to make sure we got in the elevator. It got to be so consistently miserable that we were counting how many stops we made on the elevator, only to have the car completely full and another 6-8 people waiting to get on while they were stranded on their upper floors. One ride we counted 10 floors where we stopped to stranded guests, and our elevator was already full. All of the other guests were frustrated and everyone agreed this was the worst elevator experience we have had. We had a lot of time together crammed in the elevator to compare notes. If you're claustrophobic or you don't want to take 10-15 minutes for simple elevator rides, you can't stay at this hotel.Unfortunately, things got worse for us. After our first 15 minute elevator experience, we got to our room and it was not the room we reserved. We specifically reserved a patio room. The front desk clerk confirmed our patio room when I checked in and talked with me about how they only have that option on one floor. Somehow, they gave me a regular room knowing that it wasn't what I reserved and confirmed on check in. They explained the patio room wasn't ready yet, so they just gave me a standard room. Strange part was, they didn't tell me that and just shipped me upstairs in the long elevator ride there and back and assumed I wouldn't notice I guess? We then learned that room #2 had a broken sofa sleeper. We needed to use it, so we had called for assistance. The maintenance person came to the room and complained that they knew it was broken and it should have been fixed. He told us they would work on it. So we stored all of our bags in the one room we had with the broken sofa and went out for the night.When we returned, we got our keys to the new room with a patio. It was a very nice balcony, but be aware, these rooms are really, really small. We have stayed at countless Embassy Suites, and these are by far the smallest rooms we have experienced. This is not a two room suite, and actually I'm not sure how they even refer to these as suites. I'm quite surprised that Embassy Suites would allow this hotel to be branded as an Embassy, But the balcony was very nice! Our only issue with this room was the air condition did not work properly. We asked for a small fan or something from the front desk and they were not available. NYC in July without proper air conditioning is not good.Back to room two. When returning to the hotel, we noticed the sofa sleeper was still broken, meaning it would not fold out in any way. We went to the desk. The clerk stated the maintenance person said it wasn't broken, although the one who came to the room immediately saw it and knew it was broken. I asked to meet the maintenance person in the room, she said he was on the way and would meet me there; he never showed up. I called and was pretty angry at that point. They then stated we would need to move rooms, which we did. We had been at this hotel less than four hours and already had to move both rooms.The next day we battled exceedingly long lines and elevator traffic for breakfast, even though we went early to avoid the crowds. They have hundreds of people staying here and the smallest breakfast facility I have ever seen at an Embassy Suites. Once again, how is this an Embassy Suites?By day two, we were told there was a water leak in room two and we would need to move again. This is the third room change in two days. So more packing up and battling the nightmare elevators. As a side note, it was pretty obvious from the first day that the shower doors have a flaw in them and a lot of water leaks out onto the bathroom floor. Bathrooms looked really nice, but they have major water issues.In the end, I can tell you that the staff in this hotel are really, really nice people. I would say this about the front desk staff and the food staff. They work in awful conditions with travelers crammed into situations they cannot manage. Whoever runs this hotel needs to come stay in it for a week and reassess their business model.This is the longest review I have ever written, or hope to ever write.

We would typically spend time at the happy hour, but the room where they serve happy hour is so...small that it was packed, lines were super long, and there was no where to sit so we just went to the lobby bar and paid for our drinks rather than fighting that mess. Also, as soon as you walk into the area for happy hour or for breakfast it's sticky all over the floors. I understand that people have spills, but the few times we went it was the same each time.

Surly Front Desk--The front desk crew clearly does not like their job and they are both unfriendly, unwelcoming and simply unhelpful in meeting your needs. 3. Non-Existent Management--I had a series of major breakdowns including the wake-up call that was never made. Despite repeated requests to the front desk and voice mails to the management team, management never bothered to contact me to address any one of my multitude of issues. The Embassy Suites ""Make It Right"" policy is a total fiction at this hotel.4. Not Enough Elevators--There are only 3 elevators to service a 39 story hotel which results in 5 to 15 minute waits. No lie--just read some of the other reviews. Talk about traffic. Make sure you don't leave anything behind since you will be spending your day waiting for the all to rare elevator cab.5. Dirty, Dirty, Dirty--The floors and hallways at this hotel are always dirty with trash and food including left-over food and dishes outside of the guest rooms. As a bonus, housekeepers left their cart outside of my room for 5 days and 5 nights despite my repeated complaints to the front desk that is clearly staffed by ghosts. The hotel is short staffed but packed with guests which is not a very good combination from a cleanliness and service perspective.If you like chaos and service breakdowns, then this is the hotel for you.","Los Angeles, California","jay N</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",4,1.0

I was so shocked and upset I had to get over really quick as they along with half of New York were sold out. Pluses: very nice, nice location and at least really clean. The evening reception had real guacamole (so good, 5 stars for that)Location: perfect, the walking distance to all things social is a really good addition to one of the perks of being in midtown. Safety: totally comfortable! I felt very comfortable walking alone and or sitting outside of the hotel. Well lit and accessible to the Main Street. Didn’t have to pass alleys or weird surroundings. I was even able to take the kids out at night and walk a few blocks! Service: I had to be an adult give the staff a chance to do what the Hilton brand always does, makes you comfortable! We are a service driven family and the warmth and understanding received by the staff was much appreciated. I can sense they knew I was dwindling over the room. Their efforts to comfort me and the kids are so appreciated. We just aren’t use to accommodations that were so confined and small! The staff went out of their way to help me “get over it”. They arrange for my car service to pick us up and take us to the airport. I called around and scheduled a Lyft all who wanted $140. Thanks for that, the ride was lovely, nice car and traffic free! The hotel is better suited for couples and single travelers. They have movie night open roof top which makes for a great date night. There is bar service, food and the lovely New York sky.

Also the garbage was never emptied, the coffee was never refilled, we never got anything but decaf and never any creamer. On our 5th day we left at 6am and arrived back at 6pm and the room was never cleaned. No new towels, shampoo, soap and again garbage not emptied. Called front desk and they said they send someone right away....45 mins later the lady at the front desk was sassy saying they just was busy and we can request what we need and someone will bring it up. After explaining we really need it cleaned (sorry when I pay that much yes I do expect my room to be cleaned daily) finally by 8:30pm someone came and cleaned.

Easy walking distance to Empire State Building. Subway was a 1-2 block walk. We were even able to walk down to Rockefeller Center and Times Square very easily. Parking is what you would expect in New York, but fairly reasonably priced for 2 whole days. Just be prepared to have your car locked in for that time if you use the discounted hotel rate. Would recommend location and hotel, but as mentioned before, be advised the room size might be a limiting factor for some.","Mont Vernon, New Hampshire","David R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mont Vernon, New Hampshire</strong>",15,4.0

I love this hotel. We arrived early and were told the room would be ready at 4 which is the posted check in time. No worries. We went to eat and grab a beer at the Keg Room and the hotel held our bags. I waited longer on the elevator at Macys than I did here. I’ve stayed at other hotels in the city and you will deal with crowds and wait times everywhere however it did not feel crowded here. (I stayed first week of May) The breakfast was great. I usually ate at 6:30 so it was less crowded. The reception was wonderful. Staff were incredible to all guests welcoming them and pre-busing their tables. The reception starts at 5 so we would snack and have pre theatre drinks then after the show get a burger or have snacks in our room. So this is a great option if you plan to see shows which we did every night. This is a great value and good location. Close to Bryant Park, shopping and Broadway.

Let me start off by saying that in NYC space is at a premium and if you’ve never been here before, the rooms are tiny everywhere. If you’ve stayed at Embassy Suites elsewhere, this will probably be unlike any other you’ve stayed at and it’s amusing they chose to open this brand in Manhattan.The rooms are in a more contemporary style that’s popular lately – wood floors & no bathtubs. We had a king studio room which had a cozy design. You enter the room in a little corridor with the bathroom right in front of you. The bathroom was outfitted with a nice big mirror with great lighting and ample counterspace. The shower was disappointing for two reasons – the showerhead didn’t have great pressure and the sliding glass doors didn’t fully close, leaving gaps at either end where water pooled on the floor outside of the shower. I would have preferred a shower with a combo rain & handheld with a stronger stream. Going further into the room, there’s a nice sitting area with a sofa bed across from a TV over a desk. In that area you also had a small fridge, microwave, and coffeemaker. Behind the couch was a divider that helped separate the space from the bed. The king size bed was comfortable with another larger TV on the wall, and the setup was cozy as the divider provided an inviting somewhat separate space for the bed. When we arrived we noticed a stain on the bedsheets. They looked as if they had been changed, but the stain didn’t come out in the wash. When I called to report it, they apologized and sent someone up within five minutes to change out all the sheets. Otherwise, the room was kept clean for the duration of our stay. In addition, I saw them cleaning the water feature in the lobby on my last day – good to see that they’re staying up with keeping things clean.Breakfast is provided daily and it’s standard fare for Embassy Suites – fruits, breads, yogurt, various eggs, potatoes, meats, as well as made to order omelets that you order from a somewhat hidden (and poorly designed) tablet located on the wall across from the cook. With the exception of Monday morning, each time we went for breakfast the whole area was crowded with no seats. There’s a small seating area the floor below with some food and drink choices that sometimes wasn’t too crowded. The food was good.There’s also an evening reception daily in the same space as the breakfast. You have a choice of wines, beers, well drinks, and a rotating sangria option. There were signs for premium alcohol for an upcharge, but they weren’t available each night and when they were available, they weren’t necessarily the same as was on the menu! The food was good with a rotating selection of popcorn, chips & guac, cheese, pita, etc. It’s a nice little extra and we didn’t have a problem finding a spot to sit down.The onsite gym is nice with your standard selection of treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and the times we went, we were able to get on a machine right away.Discounted parking is available in a garage directly behind the hotel and when you check out, you can access the garage from a door in the back of the lobby of the hotel. Note that on that block there are two different parking garages, the one that Embassy Suites has a deal with is the second one on the block. The parking charge is added to your room charge. Overall this was a decent choice in a central location with rates that weren’t too expensive. I would consider staying there again.","Boston, Massachusetts","MySobriquet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",54,3.0

People complaining about the restaurant being busy in the morning is like complaining about the city being busy at rush hour, if you want a quiet breakfast GET UP EARLIER!!!! The breakfast is absolutely amazing, LOADS to choose from to suit every taste , plus the omelettes made to order by the hard working chef (who may I add was working the whole 7 mornings I was there as were the girls on the restaurant floor too) hard working people to make sure us customers got a great service.There are 3 lifts in the hotel and yes they can be busy at times but again its NEY YORK folks, the city of high rise buildings so NATURALLY lifts will be busy in any hotel at times, All in all this hotel was top notch from the minute I walked in the door to check out time , i could not fault it in any way , and anyone who does is just down right fussy looking for notice, this place will not disappoint you i have worked in the tour trade in Ireland and the UK for a few years staying in many many hotels and this one is right up there with the best if them .

I would rate it no star if there is an option. First, from the check in experience, there is a diamond check in line, no staffs are there, and other staff told me nobody there and didn't even offer help to me for check in. Diamond status means nothing here. Then when I get into my room, wow, is this an Embassy Suites or to be precise, is this a ""suites""? For those that had experience with Embassy Suites, you will know what I mean. This is a tiny room that hardly accommodate 3 person, why is it calls suites? Are you trying to cheat people? Then when I want to use the toilet, the toilet bowl cover is not installed but leave laying on the bowl. I have to grab a housekeeping outside to help. Why are they letting customer to check in to a not ready room? Also there is no bottle water given in the room, normally it is there if check in online. I thought the worst is over but not. If you plan to use the elevator, good luck, please plan to spend at least 15 minutes to squeeze into the tidy one. I can see 3 elevators but not sure how many of them actually working. My advise is to choose lower floor so that you can use staircase rather than elevator, your time is more valuable than waiting for the elevator. Due to this, I not even able to have breakfast or evening reception. I feedback this to the hotel, but just get an apology without seeing any action to mitigate or even make it right for customer. I had issue in the past with other Hilton properties but the management do take action to help and I do really appreciate that.

You don’t get a separate living room and bedroom-just a normal, smallish standard hotel room. The typical “suites” do not exist. So the name is a bait and switch tactic to fool those of us who have enjoyed staying at embassy suites elsewhere.Second. You have to allow for at least a 10 minute wait anytime that you want to use the elevators. They are small, slow and too few. Always packed completely full while they stop on floor after floor, too crowded for additional passengers to board. I was here for 5 nights and seriously considered moving to another hotel just to avoid these elevators.Third. Regular embassy guests are used to very crowded breakfast rooms. Their free cooked breakfast are well above average. Unfortunately, this location was far WORSE than any of the 10+ embassy locations I’ve visited in the past. The layout of the room is terrible-just getting off the elevator on the 4th floor is like Times Square on New Year’s Eve! Then after you wait in line for food for 15 minutes, there are NEVER any tables available. People stand up with their food plates while they stalk occupied tables hoping to pounce on a table the moment someone gets up to leave. There is no point trying to walk around looking for other options, because the space is too tight to move.

I would highly recommend. From the first moment we entered the building, the staff really could not do enough for us. The concierge, Wolfgang, provided exceptional customer service, and even remembered what we were doing/where we going and asked questions when we returned - just the little things. We got married whilst we stayed, and required flowers, make up artists, various members of the bridal party to come up to our room. The front desk really helped us to co-ordinate this, and even brought things to our room themselves to ensure everthing ran smoothly. On our return to the room on a wedding evening, we came back to a bottle of processco, cheesecake and other deserts with a little note congratulating us on being married. Again, something they didnt need to do but we really appreciated. In addition the breakfast is great, as is the location and there are complimentary drinks from 5-7 everyday + we had an awesome view of the empire state building from our window.

As HHonors Gold members we expected I might have been offered an upgrade -- but no, we ended up in just about the tiniest room my spouse and I have ever stayed in, and that includes Europe where rooms are small… While Room 2208 did face the Empire State Building, it had only one very small, very dirty window through which you could barely see outside to the Empire State Building and Macy’s –very unlike the photos at the booking website for a “King High Floor City View” showing a floor-to-ceiling window and lots of light. Very misleading.Free evening “reception” is a joke, try and find a place to stand, let alone sit. It was chaotic, everyone running everywhere. Food selection was sparse – cubes of cheese, no crackers. They were overwhelmed by the crowds. Nachos and Guacamole with no sanitary measures was disgusting since the disorderly crowd was hand dipping their chips, and there was no sanitary control by the staff. Finally, on Monday, our last day, we were able to use the breakfast service which was good, and the omelet station worked well, staff was great. Positives: Anita at the Front Desk was wonderful.

The person at front desk was clueless, did not seem to be aware of the email we sent to Cleopatra [-] (who was front desk supervisor back) regarding our room allocation one week earlier. She asked us to come back at 4pm.We then came around 5pm, stood in the queue at the front desk. When it was our turn, we went in front of the first front desk employee who was available. She did not acknowledge us and was staring at her screen. After some time, she checked and told us that the room was not ready. She asked us to go the ""bar"" and come back 30min later. We went to the bar, first of, she did not tell us that we needed a key to access the lift, so we had to bother guests asking them to flash their card for us. We came back 30min later and went straight to the woman who we talked to 30min before (she was not dealing with customers).This woman, who already had a lot of attitude during our previous attempt to check-in, just did not bother looking at us nor she acknowledged us (once again). I tried to talk to her, but she simply ignored us. Then, another front desk waved at us and proceeded to our check in. This other front desk employee, who will be mentioned in the comments later, was THE ONLY professional front desk employee of the whole hotel.So here we are, checking in at around 6pm when the employees knew we were waiting for the room since 11am.Regarding the room allocation, I asked for a quiet bedroom and a room with Empire State Building views. I specifically paid an extra $200 to be guaranteed a room with a view. I also stated that since we were staying for 10 days, we needed a large bedroom.We entered into a room with a tiny hospital-like window with, indeed, a view of the Empire State building when you flex your knees and turn your head to the left. The view itself was disappointing, but the most disappointing part the SIZE of the room. Yes, I saw management's comments saying that although its Embassy Suites due to its location it's not suites but bedroom and that they consider themselves larger than most rooms in the area. YOU GUYS NEED TO REBRAND THIS HOTEL, it cannot be labelled as Embassy Suites. PERIOD. The room was TINY. We just had space to walk around the bed and that's about it. It was like 12m2, the closest was in the bathroom. Yes, you read properly, our tiny closest was in the bathroom. Everything was sooo small, probably standard size for NY yet this is Embassy Suites and they say their room are on the larger side for NY but it's simply not true. Further, the AC was noisy as hell and just by the bed, there was no way I could have had decent sleep in such room.We complained and were changed to a disabled room on the other side of the corridor. That room was indeed, larger, but had many issues. One the main issue is that the TV cannot be watched from the bed. There is a couch, too small to fit two people so it's like you take turn to watch the TV.The disabled bathroom was odd, shower head super low, it was only designed to cater for disabled guests obviously although there are many disabled rooms (almost half of them) in this hotel and therefore, non disabled guests are constantly allocated to these rooms. But the biggest disappointment was the view, not only there was no Empire State Building views, but a huge condo building was just in front and we could see everything in the apartments so you can imagine that people living in front see everything in our bedrooms. We spent the whole stay with curtains closed which we specifically booked this property for the views advertised.Whenever we emailed the then Front Desk supervisor, who seems to have been promoted to front desk manager - Cleopatra [-] , she took a long time to reply (she actually did not reply or acknowledged half of our emails during our stay). We saw her at the front desk and pointed that out and she just replied to us that she started her day at 1pm (a couple of hours earlier) and therefore had no opportunity to reply (yet this emailed remained answered after). This was ridiculous given the fact we copied several employees of the hotel to ensure a prompt reply.We were shown another room on a lower floor on the second day. We refused the room, we told them that they layout was underwhelming and not worth moving taking the lift and risking having upstairs neighbors. We asked that if the same room on our floor was vacant, that they move us there. We never heard from them again and the room mentioned had various guests checking in and out during the rest of our stay. When we pointed it out to Cleopatra [-] , she just said ""we showed you a room and you refused it"" end of the story.The rest of our stay, we constantly experienced attitude from some of the front desk employees, and in particular the sassy one from check in that would give us evil eyes whenever we walk by or ask for water (yeah because there is no complimentary water in the room you need to ask for it at the front desk and when you do, half of the time they refuse giving it).Breakfast was okay, but after one morning we just got sick of it. The menu remained the SAME our whole stay, nothing new. It's a very basic breakfast (pancakes, sausages, potatoes) with a nice egg station (they pride themselves to have it as a brand for Embassy Suites but every 4-5 stars hotels have one). After 5 days I just could not take their breakfast anymore.One of the perks of this hotel is the free open bar from 5 to 7 but apparently they lost their license and no longer serve alcohol. Also, one of the bartender was constantly pressuring us for tips and would give us attitude when we tip $1. One night a large group of people rented a room to have a alcohol and possibly drug-fueled party in a room on our floor. Despite many complaints, nothing was done about it. When I emailed Cleopatra [-] about it, her only reply was ""they were only here for one night"". Below the paragraph from the email I sent her regarding this issue :They started being more and more noisy and were obviously intoxicated, shouting in the corridor, or keeping their door open all night to allow people to get in and out. I cannot emphasize enough how noisy it was. Never in my life I have had such experience in a hotel before. These people were very obviously hosting a party in their room and were probably under the influence of certain substances. We called the front desk at 11:30 for them to stop this. We never heard anyone coming up there to ask them to keep it down or better : not to have a party at all in a small hotel room while other clients are sleeping. And that despite the promises of the person who pick up the phone. We called the front desk around 3 am for the same purpose and were told that they were sending someone up here. We never heard any staff knocking at their door or communicating with them. This carried on all night. We tried to sleep but could barely sleep since this group was shouting, partying and slamming door all night. And despite wearing ear plugs and having a room not sharing a wall with them, it was impossible to get some sleep.And of course, nothing was done, not even an apology bottle of wine. Nothing, nada. Never in my life I experienced such a low level of hospitality.Finally, a few hours after check out, I realized I forgot my usb drive in the room. I notified Cleopatra [-] who found the drive. I asked her to mail it back to me in Cleveland and she had the nerve to ask me to send her a prepaid label. First of, I never had to obtain a prepaid label for an item I could not present to the post office for them to weight the package so I had to guess the possible weight of the package (that was a struggle). Secondly, it was super complicated to obtain a prepaid label on USPS website (took my one week because the website was not compatible with Safari and Chrome (had to download Mozilla) as I could not go past the second page (I would get an error message). You could think that when you spend thousands in hotel room at a 4 stars hotel and forget a small item, they would mail it back to you (especially since it was within the US), but NO, according to Mrs [-] $7 is $7 and they are too cheap to pay for it. That's insane, I forgot stuff in rooms before and they would send it back to me in FedEx at their expenses but with Embassy Suite apparently the customer has to obtain the label and pay for shipping fee. I don't care about paying, but I really struggled to obtain the label it's so ridiculous that they wouldn't get the label themselves then charge it on the card I used for the reservation!Also, room cleanliness was terrible. Not very clean upon check in (hair that didn't belong to me, not so clean mirrors, etc), but throughout the stay so many things were not cleaned (like sometimes they would leave dirty dishes in the room, or for instance they never cleaned the tray despite me putting it on the floor middle of the room to show them that it was dirty).I could go on and on, but it took me 3 months to write that review because I don't want to waste my time over this hotel. Yet I had to address it. I gave them many opportunities to correct the issues, I informed Cleopatra [-] of my dissatisfaction but she could not care less about the reputation of this property. I told her I would review this hotel on TripAdvisor on my third or fourth day (over ten), but she did not acknowledge my email nor did she try to make things up to us.

The view from our room was beyond AMAZING!!! It was everything and more than I had hoped it would be! The room itself is beautiful as well. Very clean & modern looking and while not a typical 2 room suite you get w/ Embassy Hotels it was plenty spacious for the two of us. After exploring the city during the day it was nice to come back to the hotel & take part in the managers reception. While they don’t currently have their liquor license they are still serving light appetizers & non alcoholic refreshments as well as vouchers to Blaggards Pub. The snack options were plentiful, rotated and refilled which was very nice (options we had were chips & guacamole, pretzels & cheese, caprese bites, popcorn, crudite, fresh baked cookies, etc...). We enjoyed the vouchers to Blaggards Pub which was 1 block away from the hotel. While service is a little slow at the pub the drinks were plentiful & they included items like Jameson & Guinness which typically wouldn’t be included in the managers reception at the hotel so that was an added bonus. Also the front desk was generous with the vouchers. Everyone worked very hard to ensure the guests were happy & taken care of. Breakfast in the morning was delicious and they had a lot of options that rotated daily. I loved the morning pastries (tasted like they were made in house) & fresh berries which was a pleasant surprise. The eating area does seem small until you realize there is another area off to the side that has more seating, we preferred to make our plates and head back to our room and enjoy that beautiful room. All of the staff we encountered were beyond friendly and most importantly helpful. I was red to make sure to send a special thank you to Nikki & Dominica/Dominique for taking such wonderful care of us! We had such an amazing anniversary trip ❤️",dc,"lilmissirish78</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>dc</strong>",7,5.0

The two main drivers for us of staying at the Embassy suites are the cocktail hour each evening and the breakfast each morning. Because of the recent sale, the liquor license had not yet transferred and therefore the cocktail hour had no liquor. The bar downstairs was the same. It would’ve been good to know rather than finding out when we went to go get something. When we did ask they gave us two vouchers for a pub around the corner. It was nice but not the same as something right with in your hotel. Breakfast on the fourth floor was a madhouse. Not sure that there is much that they could’ve done to control that any better but it was crazy. The fruit was terrible. Mushy old and discolored.

Later that morning I called the front desk to inquire about the charge, I was told it was a hotel error and the money should go back to my account in a couple of days.5) I ordered room service. I was overcharged for a item that showed $21 on the menu. When the bill arrived they charged me $24. The attendant was given the wrong room, therefore once I received my food it was cold and disappointing. I paid $8 for two bottles of water that should've been free.

The bed was comfortable, but I kept banging my shins on the platform (it's not padded) when getting in. My room had the closet in the bathroom, which would be inconvenient for more than one person in the room. I think they have larger rooms; this was at the lower HHonors rate. So, look for larger with more than one person.The elevators were very fast, and there were many of them. You won't wait long. The stairs are all over.

We were transferred to Homewood Suites instead ... so this year, I was excited to book at Embassy Suites. It was not bad and the location is perfect - but my next trip to the city will summon me back to Homewood Suites. I booked and confirmed a King Suite with a view. The bad - Check in was at 4 ... we arrived around 3 and were told it wasn't ready. Since it was New Year's Day, we completely understood and said we'd be back. We got back by 5:30pm and the room still wasn't ready. Eager to checkin and get ready for dinner, we settled for a smaller room that still guaranteed a King size bed and view. Small doesn't adequately decribe this room. There was barely room to walk around the bed. The bathroom was tiny - had no fan, little vanity space and a designer sink that splashed water all over the floor. The in-room refrigerator was inside a cupboard and did not have a stable mount so it wobbled; coffee maker was fine but not enough cups provided. There is a small bar - but it never seemed to be open or have a bartender and it isn't really a bar - it is in the corner of the lobby right in the open spot where guests check in. The good - the view was OUTSTANDING. The bed was very comfortable - got a good night's sleep - room was quiet. The 4-7pm reception available to Hilton members was excellent and a nice reward for members - I'm sure it must be wonderful in warmer weather when the terrace can be used. The breakfast buffet runs until 11:00am - unfortunately we got to breakfast at 10:30am and almost everything was gone and wait staff was already clearing out pans, etc. We settled for a few cold scrambled eggs - and some tiny muffins there was nothing else. However, from what we could see - it must have been great had we gotten there earlier. The location is perfect and an easy pick-up for Uber and taxi's. Macy's and Herald Square is around the corner and the walk to Penn Station was fine - was no need for an Uber or taxi. We usually stay at a Marriott or Hilton for our points - and lately used Hilton more than the Marriott. Perhaps the original room I booked would've been better because what I accepted was sub-par. They did however, credit me the difference on cost. Perhaps I'll give it another try but I can't say that definitively - too many other Hilton owned properties in the area to try instead. So as my title said - it was a mix for me but definitely not a write-off.","Coventry, United States","Kathy L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coventry, United States</strong>",7,3.0

We had flown 5 family members from the United Kingdom solely to share in this excitement and be a part of this wedding proposal, which was arranged as a surprise for my daughter. I personally booked the room, on behalf of my daughters partner, under his details havingspoken to many Hilton agents and the hotel direct to ensure the correct room type was selected for this solepurpose, explaining to them its importance and our requirements as a customer.The Reservation was booked well in advance, 3rd Dec and the Hilton agent reassured me several times the room, had been “lockdown” under our booking and there would be no issues upon check-in.Having had this assurance, and trust built we opted to select Hilton as the venue of choice, based on the fact it had this sky terrace where we could arrange for a photographer, musician etc., which we now deeply regret now.We obtained a “booked confirmation” that clearly reads the room type we booked along with the special notes highlighting and providing details on the event and reservation being made for conduct a surprise wedding proposal.We sought support from the hotel direct who advised us which room would be perfect, giving us the terrace for a terrace rooftop style venue as a proposal , and the view of the Empire state building. The hotel agent supplied theactual room number reassuring that particular was free and she had booked it so ensure no one else could be allocated that particular room. I asked for confirmation of this a number of times and a number of times from 3 separate Hilton staff members at the hotel I was advised everything was in hand and correct.. 12emails were exchanged, with a named contact and the main hotel group email address confirming this, 7 personal calls which I had made from the UK to the hotel direct again to ensure the room type, roomnumber/reservation was in hand and each time I received reassurances the room that was quoted was on file and booked! Each time I was reassured/promised everything was taken care off, they understoodthe importance of getting this right and for me to not to worry I was “in safe hands” .On the 5th Jan 2018 before we left from the UK I again made a call, and was again told not to worry everything had been taken care of and an early check-in of 3pm had been notes on file too. (7th Jan 2019 upon check a few hours ahead of the “bride to be’s arrival ,we found ourselves having a conversation with the check in desk advising the room they had confirmed several times , was in fact already occupied by other guests and the hotel had made an error!!! How this error had happened they didn’t understand, neither were they able to provide a valid explanation, in-fact, I heard excuses, which insulted my intelligence, when I tried to ask for an explanation and resolution to the problem Hilton hotel had created . At one point they denied it was their fault and passed the blame to Hilton reservations team, and then the Hilton Honours IT! I HAD TO INTERJECT WITH INFORMING THEM IT WAS THIS VERY SAME HOTELI HAD 12 EMAIL EXCHANGES AND 7 PHONES CALL WITH! .We showed the confirmation print out which stated KING BED STUDIO WITH VIEW & BALONY 518 USD per night. We were left at reception for an hour trying to understand what had gone wrong and advised by the hotelthere was nothing they could do, no other room like for like was available andthey couldn’t ask the occupants to vacant the room! Yet they could leave us stranded, without the room we had booked, received confirmation on, and had based our whole international trip around. We were left with no otherchoice but to cancel the photographer & musician and were left with little choice but accepting a room without a terrace, and room we had all our plans based around, including the layout and floor sixe etc. The hotel offered us a much smaller room, which is no compensation for the upset caused and inconvenience. The space offered was way too small for the photographer and his equipment and the musician , us, and having being left with 2.5 hrs to my daughters arrival it left us with our hands tied and having to accept just anyroom. Had this been the case we wouldn’t have travelled all the way to New York booked this particular hotelhad we known we would have been forced to do the proposal in a hotel room with a terrace, If I was going to do thissurprise in just any room, I could have done this in any hotel, in the UK ! This incompetency by the Hilton hotel has totally ruined what should have been one of the most magical trips, leaving us stressed and very upset that we will not have photos capturing the moment , ambience and moments we had expected and planned for .No amount of compensation will cover the heart break resulted by the Hiltons failure, for which a mere “Sorry” is un-expectable .For the Hilton this is brand damaging and we would never recommend anyone to entrust Hilton gain.

We got back from all day sightseeing. Our room had never been made up. We arrived back to an unmade bed, and our used towels still on The floor. Within 5 minutes of getting back to the room housekeeping showed up. We were exhausted, so just asked for fresh towels. 2) We used up the roll of toilet paper. There was not a spare roll in the room. I’ve never stayed in a room without an extra roll of TP. One of the things I read in previous reviews was the wait for the elevators could be long.

The Managers Reception from 5-7pm daily is SUCH a nice perk! We got there right at 5 (a little bit before that on NYE) and at 6 another day, and were able to get a table all three days. People pile up the food, so they may run out. But it's a nice, included perk and I was just grateful for a ""free"" glass of wine and some snacks before dinner in NYC. Some of the snacks were pretzel bites, bruchetta, cookies, etc.The included breakfast was always delicious! But, as other reviews have mentioned, the dining area is small and tables are at a premium. So, go knowing you may have to wait for a table or plan to bring your food back to your room if you can find a tray. Of our three mornings, we always had a spot, but there were only two of us. May be more of a challenge for larger groups. . The biggest confusion for people (myself included on morning #1) is they have a kiosk on the wall where you enter the cooked-to-order eggs you want. There are so many other hot breakfast items (the bacon was delicious!) But omelets are definitely the main attraction. There are only 3 elevators for 35+ floors of rooms. So, be prepared to wait. I was put off by this at first, but my Brother In Law travels to NY regularly for work and said we were lucky to have three as he's stayed at hotels with only one! We were on the 35th floor and decided that if we went back we'd pick a lower floor so we could just use the stairs. We paid for a ""room with a view"", but I don't think the upcharge was worth it. Attached a picture of our view. You can decide!Our flight was early so we got to the hotel well before check-in and they stored our luggage. When we arrived back at 5PM the room I selected on the Hilton Honors app wasn't available so they gave us a room by the elevator, which I was nervous about, but it ended up being fine. No noise. Our room was tiny (12x18 maybe?) but it's New York, where space is at a premium, so that wasn't a surprise. We had an issue with our bill and the manager was very helpful and friendly and listened to my complaint and remedied the situation immediately. The hotel is SO conveniently located. We walked to everything (Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Plaza, Empire State Building) and there is a Subway stop around two blocks away. I'd absolutely stay here again! Just, on a lower floor and won't mess with a ""room with a view"" because we barely spent any time in our room.

It's newer hotel and the location is ideal. Within walking distance to the subway, Herald Sq, Bryant Park and many other must see places. The cons of this place may be isolated instances and due to the busy time of year (Dec). We are Diamond Hilton members, made our reservations months in advance and when we checked in at 9 pm we got a 3rd floor room in a 35 floor hotel. We didn't receive housekeeping for two days, had to call four times and wait an hour before our room was cleaned up at 7 pm. The free breakfast and manager's reception are hosted in a small area with A LOT of people; we showed up and immediately left. One night we were resting in our room and heard someone fiddling with our bedroom lock. My husband opened the door and saw a man trying to unsuccessfully open our door. My husband questioned the man, he replied he was with the hotel and checking the locks. We went to the front desk to alert them of an attempted break in and they confirmed it was a hotel staff member checking locks. Had we received an advanced notice from the hotel letting us know of the scheduled safety check, or if the man would have showed his hotel ID, we may not have been as startled as we were - the event ruined the rest of our evening.

Rooms were clean and functional for 2 people - we were traveling with our daughter so she had the sofa bed - the maintenance man was called as the sofa bed was jammed. We played hunt the sheets / blanket and pillow game - under the main bed. The sofa bed was never put away by cleaning staff - so room wasn't cleaned well. Lack of storage for clothes was an issue - everything was compact - travel light. So what we didn't get told - there is a fee bar and stacks every day from 5 until 7 - prepare for a bun fight to get a drink / table ( we found this out when we sat at the lobby bar 2 days in - we made a fuss and got a drinks voucher for the lobby bar ) . Breakfast was the same - lack of sitting space - a number of guests just piled up the food and went back to their rooms.

This is Not what I payed for!The Suite:We stayed in a studio suite King, with a view. View towards Macy’s and Empire State Building. Nice view, but not worth the extra bucks. Very good sound isolation, it was silent as a grave. Chargers on several locations = Spot on. When you build a new hotel, please try to add some hooks on the walls to your guest can hang some clothes. I don’t think a couple of hooks blows your whole budget.....A tip from an experienced traveler. There is plenty of space to put hooks behind the door!

We arrived late afternoon on the Friday and were greeted with a reception/foyer area that was rather busy - the hotel is very busy generally and it only takes a few guests to congregate in reception and it becomes quite ‘packed’ and confusing. There is a magical water feature which kept our son entertained whilst I checked in. Delightful and attentive check-in staff who were aware of the ‘package’ (aka son’s Xmas presents) that we’d had arranged to be delivered to the hotel! We had a ‘room with a view’ on the 37th Floor, Room 3707. It certainly didn’t disappoint, the view that is - we had a wonderful vista of the Empire State Building. The room is what you would expect of New York, quite a lot squeezed in and little room to manoeuvre. There is very little space around the bed and at least one point in the stay the entire family ‘bumped’ feet and/or legs into the side of the bed. The lounge area is nice and alongside the regular coffee making machine there is a big sofa, microwave and fridge. Storage is a problem - there just isn’t enough. One pull out drawer and room to only hang a few items - this is a real let down, particularly as we are travelling for 15 days in total and have a lot of luggage.Bath/shower area is great, spacious and has everything you’d expect. Breakfast is served on the 4th Floor in the Embassy Lounge and has a good selection of items. The made to order omelette section is particularly good - you order your omelette on a digital screen selecting fillings, egg type etc. The downside of breakfast - served on plastic plates with plastic crockery that is prone to ‘snapping’ when you attempt to cut anything. However this changed after a few days and crockery and plates were made available. Drinks also served in plastic and paper cups. We had access to the lounge in the evenings for drinks and light snacks - we attempted to go twice during our five night stay but it was just too busy and we didn’t make it in. The one night we made it in was great - good selection of wines, beers and house spirits. We did have to raise the issue of the cleanliness of the room and the lack of replenishment of coffee, creamer etc on a couple of occasions and this was dealt with promptly. And on the issues people have raised with the lifts - we had no problems. In summary a well positioned hotel (10min walk to Times Square); very friendly and helpful staff and acceptable rooms. With a few minor tweaks to the rooms, breakfast and evening lounge it would have been a perfect stay. Stayed with my wife and 5 year old son.

The hotel staff were attentive and excellent problem solvers who provided great customer service every time we had a request. Our room was clean and spacious by New York city standards, with a queen bed and pull out sofa bed. While within walking distance to many midtown/Times Square attractions, the hotel is on a quiet city side street, making getting a good night's sleep easier. Our requests for bedding for the sofa bed and repair of our shower which was leaking water onto the bathroom floor were quickly met. Not easily resolved were the hotel's incredibly slow elevators. During our visit one elevator even broke down and trapped guests for awhile. We often took the stairs and shared the frustration of other guests who would form lines in the lobby waiting for elevators. Hopefully the hotel will be able to resolve this issue. We enjoyed the complimentary full breakfast in the morning which included made to order omelets and a great variety of fruits, cereals, pastry and other options. We did not enjoy the lack of dining space and the often not clean tables in the breakfast dining area. Again the hotel staff did their best trying to help guests by pointing out additional dining space on other floors and offering to go containers but a process improvement is in order with this area as well. This is not an inexpensive hotel to stay in and I'm hopeful that the challenges with the elevators and seating for breakfast will be improved because the location is great and the staff really cares about guest satisfaction. I would still recommend the hotel to families or friends who want a more spacious room and be able to walk to many NYC attractions near midtown but be on a quieter side street, away from the noise and lights of Times Square.

The hotel is spotless, and the location is in the heart of manhattan.The con: If you have stayed at an Embassy Suite property in other areas your expectations of what your room will be are sure to disappoint you. This is Not an all suite hotel. The room is not a suite, but a regular hotel room, and a small one at that.We stayed here on Thanksgiving weekend, so the hotel was full. Our room was on the 32nd floor. Nice for views, but a horror to get to since the hotel only has 3 elevators. In the mornings we waited 15 minutes for an elevator that was not full.Also, because of the number of guests trying to get breakfast around the same time the dining area could not handle it, and people had to eat their food standing in the hallway.Bottom line: I would not stay in this hotel again.

It is newly built, immaculatly clean, and even offers free daily breakfast and complimantary drinks and snaks between 5pm and 7pm every day. The hotles location is fab as it is near to transport links, Macy's, lots of resturant choices and only a few blocks from times square. We were on floor 25 and faced out the back of the hotel with views of Herald square and and amazing close up of the Empire state building. Upon checking into our room we were gobsmacked with the view and how beautiful the rooms are. We didn't get a suite room as such but the room we were in was beautiful with a sofa at the end of the bed and large wall mounted TV. Bathroom is beautiful and ample towels and Neutrogina tiletries changed by housekeeping daily. The free breakfast was a great suprise which saved us a fortune on food and drinks in the morning. Lots of choice of hot and cold drinks, cereals, breads, muffins, pastries, muffins, yoghurts and hot breakfast items such as sausages, bacon, scrambled eggs, French toast ect. Much more choice than ever expected and they even have an omelette station where you can get made to order eggs and omelette. All staff from housekeeping and maintenance to managment of the hotel were very accommodating and could not do enough to help what ever the request. I would like to say a special thank you to Glen from housekeeping who we met accidentally in the elevator who went way above and beyond his role. He not only helped us with directions and transport queries but even took us outside and spent 15 minutes trying to flag us a taxi down during New Yorks crazy rush hour. Along side all of the hotels other positive atributes it is the hotels workers such as Glen and others that we met that made our first trip to NYC less scary and very enjoyable. I would highly reccomended this hotel and will definatley be staying with them again when we return to New York. Not a bad word to say about Embassy suites by hilton manhatten.

Yes the breakfast/reception area was small..but we were always able to find a spot, and the staff are really good about getting tables cleared and cleaned. If you are a planner like me and with your family...just some things to note. We were on an eleven day trip along the East coast so we had a lot of luggage and things. The rooms are small...and I understand why. Everything in NYC is small...space is at a premium. When there are four in a family it is very tight so less is more when you are packing. The closet pretty much just holds your coats . I didn't find the two drawers under the bed until the second day. Haha. There is one very small drawer in the closet. There are no self serve laundry facilities in the hotel and the front desk person told me there are none nearby. The parking garage that is attached to the hotel is NOT owned by the hotel. You pay about $60 a day and once they drive your car in you don't see it until you get it out. This was something different for us - another thing I wish I had known. Not complaining about any of this as I totally get it all - just thought I would pass on the info. This hotel is great and I would definitely stay again. I always felt safe and welcome there.

Great sized bathrooms that were modern. Don't expect huge, but don't expect tiny either. Comfortable bed and sofa. Good water pressure. Heating and cooling system was quiet. Location was quiet for NYC. Windows do open slightly. Elevators can be very slow.Common areas were very clean (although I *HATE* how they leave the housekeeping carts in the hallways all day everyday). Rooms were very clean, as well. Housekeeping staff is very friendly and makes sure you have what you need or want!Nice breakfast. All the food was stocked and re-stocked well. Great selection of warm and cold items. Staff was friendly. Gets a little hectic, but it wasn't nearly as bad I was expecting. Enjoyed the evening managers reception for the snacks and free wines/spirits/soda. The pretzel bites were my personal favorite!Location wise, it's an A-Plus Plus. It's in a perfect Midtown location. Can easily get anywhere via walking or subway. Subway line is 2 blocks away.

The location in the heart of midtown is fantastic. The hotel is brand new, smart and well finished. We found the staff to be very friendly, but the overall experience still needed a lot of work. Check in was efficient, however we were then made to wait 15 mins (well after check in time) for a room to actually be ready. The room was small, but had everything you needed including a big bed and sofa area. The bathroom was clean and well appointed. Every evening there is a free drinks reception with nibbles, which is a nice touch, however it is embarrassing watching some people trying to drink as much as possible and eat as much free food as possible. The service was fast. Breakfast is a buffet style. The area it is served in is waaaaaay too small for the size of the hotel and there is not enough seating when the area gets busy. The food was fine, nothing special but serviceable. Unfortunately the service was what really let the place down. On our first day we arrived back at the hotel at 1800, to grab a quick shower before going out for dinner. The room had not been serviced which was disappointing as we had been out all day and ensured the do not disturb sign had been removed from the door. When we complained at reception a half assed service was done while we were out at dinner, including dirty pillow cases being left in the middle of the floor. On day two the servicing of the room was hit and miss, one bin emptied, the other not, no refills on the coffee and new towels provided but the used ones left in a heap on the floor. On day three the room was again not serviced at all. By this point we were so fed up we didn't even bother reporting it to reception. Overall this hotel only deserves an average rating. The building is great, the room was lovely, the staff are friendly, but the housekeeping was completely and utterly inadequate.

The system didn't add the guest name to Embassy's system so I had to wait 30 mins at the lobby. The staff told me ""call the reservation office to talk to me"" so I had to be on the phone 30 mins to be checked in.

We went up ahead of the bellman to our 30th-floor room with a full, clear view of the Empire State Building and Herald Square, and there in the living room were the flowers in a vase, a bottle of Chardonnay, and not one but two cheese-and-fruit trays! It was perfect and he was completely surprised. And down it went from there. Our second day at the hotel, we returned in the late afternoon for happy hour (5:00 p.m.) to find that our room had not been visited by the housekeeping staff. So we called and reported this, and then went to happy hour. Happy hour the first day was very good, with Shannon running the bar. She's quite personable and allowed me to fetch drinks for both of us (since husband was working on his laptop) even though the sign said one drink per person. The second day, Jackson and another fellow tended bar; Jackson was great, but the other guy was a Nazi about that one-drink rule. Third day, we had George and Jerry, who were just excellent. Then I lost track, but we did have the Nazi again on our last night. There's no need to be as rude as he was about that stupid rule. Happy hour food, as is often the case with Embassy Suites, was hit or miss. The best day had salami, cheeses, and crudites. The worst day had as its centerpiece a liquid processed cheese-like substance that would have perhaps been okay served warm; however, this was more like a melted candle. Husband had to have dinner with colleagues one night, so I opted to stay at the hotel and have bar food for dinner on the lovely Skylawn, where George and Jerry were working that night. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and the chicken meatballs with celery chips and bleu cheese sauce. It was a beautiful, cool night with a glorious sky. I very nearly fell asleep, it took so long for my food to arrive. In fact, it took so long that I complained to Jerry, who comped me with a second glass of Cabernet. I will say the food was delicious, albeit nearly an hour later that I received it. Or perhaps I was simply starving. There were a few other housekeeping glitches, such as not receiving a fresh liner for the ice bucket; failing to understand that it was okay for her to clean the room while I worked at the desk; failure to deliver fresh coffee cups; failure to remove dirty dishes from room service; and complete, obvious failure to clean the floors AT ALL on a particular visit, and not returning to do so after two requests. It gets worse. Because our flight was in the late afternoon of checkout day, we had requested from Craig a late checkout. He graciously granted us a checkout time of 2:00 p.m. This allowed us to have a nice, long walk on our final day in the city, followed by a leisurely brunch. We returned to our hotel around 1:30, thinking we would have ample time to freshen up, collect our baggage, and be on our way to La Guardia. However, after traveling 30 floors on very slow elevators on that Friday afternoon, we arrived at our hotel room door to find that our key cards had been wiped out. Rather than endure the slow elevators for a drip back down, we attempted to reach the front desk on the house phone in the hallway. No answer. So we had no choice but to ride back down. The front desk clerk found that Craig had made NO NOTATION of our late checkout. The clock was ticking. We were on the last flight back to Houston and we could not miss it. New keys, return trip to 30 on the slow elevator, with zero time left for anything except to snatch up our luggage and be off. I can't say that we won't EVER stay at this location again, but it did pose some challenges that are beneath Hilton standards. I will say that everyone was very nice. Well, except for that Nazi bartender. And one host in the cocktail reception area. Oh, and the one staffer (male, position unknown) who dropped the F bomb while conversing with us in the slow elevator.","Houston, Texas","Van E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",122,3.0

This could not have been cleaned for months. Then I looked at a vent in the bathroom and again complete dust. I was very disappointed about this. It’s beyond not cleaning this is a health hazard.

Living area gets tight when you open the sofa bed. And if you have number of luggage, bags then you really need to plan properly as you dont get lot of space for luggage in the room. Bed sides is good for walking (side by side) and you cannot put any luggage there as well. Surely good for couple but difficult for families. And walls are not thick, as you could hear others talking in the room and walkway. You get good view of Empire State Building if you take city view room.Breakfast area is small so if you want to enjoy breakfast at a table, go early. When I say early, I mean really early, like when they start the breakfast service. It gets crowded very quickly and hotel seriously lack siting space in the breakfast/restaurant area, considering the number of rooms and guests it can accomodate. You have omellete station, and breakfast is good. When you take the elivator, you will see the best, busy, worst times for breafast as they have put breakfast traffic info. Same is for the Evening Social. If you want to enjoy drinks and have good time with family, be there on time and grab a table. You can always go back to your room with the drink. We were lucky to find a table on first evening but on the second we had a small faisco as the table which we took was empty but then we were visited by a guest who was claiming that he was siting at the table (which was for 4 guest), by himself. He started shouting at my mom (I was at the bar at that time) and my wife politely asked him to lower his voice, which he didnt. Then the guests in the next table interveened and when the drunk guest saw that couple of more people are coming over to support us, he backed out and took another table (for 2) in front of us, which was availabel all the time. So you will see all sorts of people in the eveing social :) Location is perfect as its very close to the Empire State Building and walking distance to all locations - Times Square, Bryant Park, Grand Central, etc. And you can park in garage nearby which is less compared to what the hotel suggested parking lot charges. Everyone at the front desk were helpful during the day time, but the team on duty at night was not so helpful. We requested for an extra comforter for the soda bed (was not present in the room) and we never got it the whole night. We called up 5 times, and it happened once that the front desk person picked up and kept the received on the side without saying anything as I could hear them very clearly but they didnt speak a word. And later, they stopped picking up the phone. I tried till 2 AM but no comforter, so I complained the next morning to the GM and we were compensated. He really took care of the case, and appreciate his willingness to help guests.Overall, it was good stay. I would surely recommend this hotel to couples who are in the city.

Two people for the weekend did not have enough space. This hotel is fairly new so the design will not get better for a long time. For the 36 hours we were there - we never saw housekeeping. The maid on our floor said we were not assigned our room; I saw two other rooms’ occupants begging for towels because of the same reason and I went to the Hilton Honors desk to ask for 2 sets of towels when the floor maid ran out.

Status of hotel room: Pros: Room was bigger than average room for family of 3, it was very clean, smelled nice and up to date. The room has a divider between the bed and couch and so it was perfect for us - sort of like a separate bedroom. Cons: Walls are thin. Elevator is painfully slow. There were many times we ended up taking the stairs from the 12th floor because the elevators were very sluggish. Water pressure was the worst I have ever experienced. Barely a trickle sometimes. Customer Service: Excellent. They were so very nice and efficient and friendly. They went the extra mile as when we had already checked out, my husband realized he left his hat. We called housekeeping and figured we wouldn't get a call back - and we did. They found his hat and kept it safe for us until we returned. Overall - this was a great hotel.

Hilton generally has always taken good care of their customers. And with the name Embassy Suits we expected much more. But honestly I was put off with my 1st impression. We had reached late night and was there with our 5 year old and a lot of luggage. But they did not have any staff to help us take the luggage (neither from the taxi nor to our room). We had to do it ourselves. We stayed here for a week and on repeated request for some vegetarian/ vegan breakfast all we got to eat in our breakfast for 7 days was fruits and cereals. As we stayed here for a week within 2 days we understood that it was more of a bed and breakfast kind of hotels where you do not expect any much of customer service. Also we had booked this brand of Hilton in New York as it was brand new and there was a promotional offer telling that they offered double bonus points to Hilton Honours members for booking in this before a certain date and we had done that. But we did not receive any bonus points for the same and now they claim that there was no such offer. Overall personally I did not get any good customer service but to be honest the rooms were decent and the location was excellent. Very close to the Time Square. Would definitely recommend staying here if you are ok to help yourself with your luggage and are non-vegetarian.

Room was small (as are most modern hotel rooms in Manhattan) and challenging for two people to move around, but pretty well appointed. We had a King room (you can get either that or a two-room suite, which I believe is too small for a King) on the 30th floor with a nice city view Bed was good. No dresser - instead, two decent-sized drawers in the frame under the bed. Good-sized bathroom and closet. Armchair and shelf acting as a shallow desk, but with two chairs! (But not adjustable, just chairs.) Good lighting.Floor was wet between A/C unit and bathroom when we walked in. Problem was condensation from A/C. They came and dried the floor, but problem recurred throughout our stay, and the finish on the floor was clearly beat-up because of this. Bathroom good, but insufficient counter/shelf space - we had to keep our toiletries in the under-bed drawers, which was a nuisance. Good hairdryer. The problem is that some elements of the hotel are poorly managed: 1. The front desk was understaffed when we got there, in part due to one of three computers being used for accounting purposes rather than check-ins. Honors desk not staffed at all. Desk staff inefficient (long conversations helping guests with non-check in issues - should have been handled by concierge or other staff - we had to wait while one of the check-in staff explained the NY subway system to another guest) and not particularly friendly or welcoming. Lots of side conversations between check-in staff and other employees while we waited.2. Elevator access a real problem (also an issue in many newer hotels). There are three passenger elevators, and during busy periods (check-in, breakfast, evening free cocktails) there were lengthy waits (>5 minutes) and sometimes the cars were so full that we couldn't get on. In addition, the service elevator was out of service for our entire stay, and according to staff had been that way for longer than they could remember. As a result, we often shared an elevator with housekeeping carts and large bags of trash. (Housekeeping personnel, who were uniformly friendly and helpful, would step out if necessary to let guests on.) Management made no effort that we could see to limit this activity to off-peak hours.3. On our second day, we slept late. As we went out in the early afternoon we asked a Housekeeping manager in the lobby to have the room made up. He was too important to discuss this with us, and referred us to another housekeeping employee. We gave her our information.

We did go either early or late - it's definitely a scrum in the middle of breakfast (both in the breakfast rooms AND the elevators).The evening reception was also great - we missed most of the snacks, but the guacamole was tasty, and the real, made-to-order cocktails were made by friendly, competent staff, with a generous pour.Don't know whether or not we'd stay here again.

Selections are varied and the food is very good. Likewise for the Manager’s Receptions each evening.Now for the bad:1. Requested some needed extra pillows/towels with online check in. They were not there upon arrival. It took three phone calls and after 6 hours (and a call to Hilton Honors customer service) I finally received them. 2. I stayed for two nights and my room was not touched by housekeeping (despite three requests through the day). At least I was able to take some towels from a linen cart in the hallway. I don’t know if they are understaffed or poorly managed (or both) but this was a first for me.3. The elevators are SLOW at peak times and it can be a problem if you are on a tight schedule and cannot take the stairs. For example, I was waiting over 20 minutes for an empty elevator on checkout. I ended up carrying my suitcase down 10 flights of stairs to the lobby. At least I wasn’t on the 39th floor!The friendly staff and good food quality do not make up for long lines for slow elevators and non-existent housekeeping services.

First, the property is newly constructed and generally clean and well appointed. Also, the location is very central in Manhattan. The biggest disappointment here was that these rooms are advertised as suites when in fact (please be warned), they are tiny even by Manhattan standards. I travel to NYC on business usually a couple to a few nights nearly every week. I usually stay at the Hilton Times Square or a handful of other properties in midtown. Every other room I’ve ever stayed in Manhattan was larger than these rooms. I switched to this hotel for this trip because I was traveling with some family members. We reserved 3 rooms and so I saw multiple layouts and they were all terribly tiny to the point of being uncomfortable. Moving on from the size issue, the elevator service was horrible! The elevators were hot (moreso than the hallways, lobbies, or rooms) and it took a full 10 minutes most times to get downstairs. The lobby layout is awkward and on this day, it took all the way until the 4pm checkin time for most rooms to be ready. On a positive, there is a parking garage where they offer a discount and good price of $45 per day. The staff was friendly in person as well. For a family, I would recommend you go to the Doubletree Suites on Broadway and 47th. Those are real suites all of which are two room suites. I’m sorry Embassy suites but I just wanted to warn people. Your property is nice looking though.

I was given a room by the elevator and lower floor. The noise of people in and out was unbearable. I said nothing as I was tired from my long flight. I say rooms because non are suites. That should not be called Embassy Suites. My stay was pathetic. The only thing that made a difference was the professionalism, great customer service and charisma of Jackson the bartender during happy hour. This gentleman made everyone feel at home and went above and beyond. What a great asset for the Hilton corporation. His colleague John was also awesome. Two employees that cared. Breakfast was good but disorganized. This hotel needs to improve customer service and treatment to their Diamond members. That check in day was my birthday and wasn’t even acknowledged. First Hilton property that didn’t even wish me a happy day. It was noted on my reservation so it tells that no one read my preferences. Overall I’ll give it a seven as Employee Jackson made a difference. Once again don’t get fooled because rooms are just regular rooms. They might call some studios but they’re really deluxe rooms.

I wasn't. It's New York City, so I'll count that as part of the reason my entrance was disorienting: the lobby was packed full of people (and I mean a LOT of people in a small space) who seemed to be sitting around doing nothing, but you have to be careful not to step on their feet as you walk by. The good news, there wasn't a line at the check in desk, so I was soon given my key to room 1505 and headed off in what I assumed was the direction of the elevators. I was wrong. The elevators are to the far left of the big room they call the lobby and check-in area. You'll need your key in order to press elevator button for the floor your room is on. But where the elevators are, and how to use them, isn't information I was given at check-in. After rolling my suitcase around around many feet of the sitting lobby people, I found the elevators, got into one, pressed my floor number, and nothing happened. That's when I learned about the key thing, from one of the maintenance men, who kindly used HIS key to activate the button to the 15th floor.I found the room down a couple narrow hallways. I was able to wave the room key in front of the sensor thingie and the door opened to a room that was even smaller than I thought I was prepared for. In fact, it's a little bigger than our master bedroom at home, including the bathroom.The room has some of the usual Embassy Suites amenities (coffee pot, 'fridge, safe) but, in this case, there's a pull out chair (rather than a pull out sofa) and nothing to separate the ""living area"" (which doesn't really exist) from the bedroom area. In short, this room is just a hotel room (not a suite) and I wasn't made aware of that when I reserved the room or when I checked in. Since it's only me (hubby stayed home), it'll work. If there were two of us, this wouldn't have been good. The room is okay for one person. It took me a full 10 minutes to find the closet ... long enough for me to conclude there wasn't one. I went looking around for other places to hang my clothes (over chairs and such) and finally found the closet behind the open bathroom door. The closet is also tiny. So tiny, I guess, that the ironing board isn't in the closet: it's to the left of the pull-out chair, leaning against a wall.The bedside ""tables"" are the kind you might find in an RV: narrow.For sports fans, the television, which is mounted on the wall at the foot of the bed, is HUGE. It has a black frame around it, so it looks even bigger than it is. I'd let that slide, but there's no mirror on a wall where you can pull up a chair and blow dry your hair, so the wall space taken up by the television seems out of balance to me. The bed itself is on the firm-side. Not wonderfully comfortable, but not awful either. If there's any warmth (such as plants) in the hotel, I haven't seen it. As I write this, it's too early for cocktail hour (which is on the 4th floor), so I haven't scouted the whole place out yet. Speaking of warmth though, there's a nice plus here: the air-conditioning works really well ... and it's hot today.Suffice it to say that for a senior rate of nearly $350/night, I had other options and now wish I'd taken one of them. This property is so-so. It's fine. But it's not the kind of cool you want when you're in Manhattan. This hotel would be perfect in Omaha, or Des Moines (no offense to those fine cities). But for NYC, not so much.","Concord, New Hampshire","ellenmoriah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Concord, New Hampshire</strong>",73,3.0

The bathroom shower leaked water out onto the floor and we had to take hand towels to jam in the gap. The housekeeping staff were very nice, however our room was never cleaned properly.

The mid thirties west of Fifth Avenue is not a fashionable district, but could be considered part of the Fashion/Garment District, center of the longstanding ""rag trade"". It certainly is convenient for exploring, working or sightseeing in Midtown. Also, the tariffs tend to be a bit lower than more glamorous or hip venues. This tall and thin 39 story hotel has only a handful of rooms on each floor, shoehorned around a catwalk hallway.Three elevators might speed or more likely slow you to your room. Our room, on the 32nd floor, had a stunning view of the Empire State building and Macy's Herald Square. Typical of a Hilton Brand, a very comfortable bed, good lighting, including in the bathroom, a mini-desk, large flat screen television and a few pieces of generic furniture. Typical of the city, everything was crammed into a very tight footprint-so much so that the closet was actually through a door in the bathroom! A nice sized shower, and a sink and toilet that were practically on top of each other. For a ""free breakfast"", they did a very good job, better than Hampton Inns, but the size constraints of the floor plan,even though the dining and serving areas were most of the fourth floor, made getting that breakfast close to a scrimmage. During the peak of breakfast time (8-10) seating capacity can be maxed out. I have tried three or four dozen hotels in New York, never finding one that was 100% of what I am looking for. But in the category of mid range ""chain hotels"", this one is worth considering if you want to be roughly half way between Penn Station and Grand Central and are looking for a clean good value place to sleep.There is limited seating in the lobby and a minimalist restaurant/bar which I wouldn't suggest trying unless there was a blizzard or the city was under siege.The staff is cordial and efficient.

We had an amazing view of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Not sure if this would work in the city but I would recommend some type of umbrella on the patio as on sunny days with the direct sun the patio was too hot to enjoy for long periods during the day but we definitely enjoyed early morning and in the evenings. I reached out to the hotel prior to our stay with a couple of questions and Diogenes responded promptly with information. I mentioned that we were celebrating a couple of things while we were in town and wine and cheese try were waiting for us upon arrival, that was a great touch and wonderful welcome to NYC. After reading some of the reviews I was afraid that the room would be extremely small but the room worked well for the two of us. We had two large suitcases a piece which we kept beside our sides of the bed. We lived out of the suitcases for the week as there was not much closet room but that didn’t hinder of affect our stay at all. We attended the complimentary breakfast once and the complimentary happy hour twice both were great. Breakfast offered wonderful options, it did get crowded towards the end but we followed the advice of the flier in the elevator and made sure we were down before the peak hours so we were finished eating before the crowd arrived. The happy hour was equally wonderful a choice of red and white wine and the bartender also made cocktails by request, that’s a value you just can’t beat in the city.

The hotel is very pretty and in a great location - within walking distance of Broadway shows, tourist attractions, a cute park, and great restaurants. The area seems very safe and there are tourists and business folks everywhere. The complimentary breakfast was rated very good by my family members who tried it. The coffee was so good. From 5 to 7 there was complimentary drinks and snacks. Everyone liked the wine choices. In the rooms there were lots of convenience outlets to plug in your stuff. Our room was a suite and my son slept on the sofa and said it was very comfortable. Now for the issues. The rooms were cramped, which we expected in NYC. There was no place to put your stuff. There was a tiny ledge around the sink and I kept knocking off my personal items. The bedside tables were so narrow I literally could not fit my phone, e-reader, glasses, and a bottle of water on it at the same time. But what is hard to understand is the poor use of space. There was a lot of space to make the bedside tables wider. I kept looking around and there were many places where small shelves and drawers could have been added to make it easier to put belongings out within easy reach. I know this isn't the managers' fault but the designers. Also we stayed at the hotel a week and twice our rooms were not cleaned. We were gone from early morning until late at night except maybe to change in the afternoon. How does this happen? We travel all the time and stay in all brands and price range hotels from modest to luxurious and they all manage to clean our rooms. We came in late from a play on our last night and our room had not been cleaned even though earlier in the evening I ran into the supervisor on my floor and he said our room would definitely be cleaned. They did send up towels when we got in from the play but it took a while so I went ahead and showered using no washcloth and drying off with a hand towel. I know if a manager replies to this review he/she will say, ""Thank you for your input and I will share this with our management team."" Which will tell me nothing. I would really like to know why this hotel cannot get the rooms cleaned or at least change out the towels. That would have been better than nothing. And I most certainly did not leave the do not disturb sign on the door as the lady at the front desk implied. We never touched it the entire trip.

We stayed on the 37th floor and the view was simply breathtaking and I mean Empire State Building full frontal view, Freedom Tower and the financial district in the distance, even caught some glimpses of hudson river :).Staff was extremely kind, breakfast was delicious and gave enough choices, evening reception was great for drinks, food was limited though, I don't know what it's like in other embassy suites. It was tasty and plenty if you only want an evening nibble and given the fact that it was complimentary.The hotel was walking distance to anything in Midtown and herald square which is like 2 mins on foot is a great hub for the subway. There were some construction on 37th street but they practically finished them during the night. No noise at all. All in all, great new and clean hotel (unlike most midtown hotels) with a fresh concept, and friendly staff, that really exceeded our expectation both in terms of quality service and the extras as well.","Budapest, Hungary","ataklap</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Budapest, Hungary</strong>",10,5.0

I exchanged emails with Alana, one of the duty managers and she could not have been more friendly and helpful.Upon our arrival, I was pleased to actually meet her. She had pre allocated our room (2609) and told us that we had some complimentary drinks at the lobby bar which we could have whenever we wished. Thank you Alana!The room itself was a little on the small side, but it was clean, new and comfortable nonetheless. After all, we knew that this wasn't billed as a five star luxury resort, so we had no complaints. The best bit about the room was the huge corner balcony which directly faced the Empire State Building, which was only a couple of blocks away. We could also just about see the top of the Chrysler building and we looked down towards Macy's, Broadway and Fifth Avenue. It really was a great view! It had a table, chairs and some big, very comfortable sun loungers, which we used one evening to enjoy the last of the sun. This was the biggest and highest balcony on that side of the hotel, so if you can pre book it, I would recommend it!The location of the hotel is really good, on 37th between 5th and 6th Avenue. Consequently, a short walk to some great shopping, the Empire State Building and about 15 minutes walk from Broadway and Times Square. We also walked to Central Park, which took around half an hour.The only issue we had during our stay was with the power tripping out when we plugged something into one of the headboard sockets. However, the maintenance guy was at the door within five minutes and flicked the breaker back on in the hallway, so no big deal.We made it to the manager's cocktail party each night to find that there was a decent selection of beer, wine and spirits on offer, all in good measures!The breakfast was also good, with a variety of hot food, fruit, yoghurts, pastries and cakes. The chef made some great omelettes too.We didn't spend much time in the hotel, but whenever we did, we were struck by the politeness of the staff. Everyone, from the reception to the bar tenders, the cleaners, maintenance guys, restaurant staff and chef were always happy and friendly, making us feel welcome and at home.

The hotel was great as far as walking distance, about 20 minutes comfortable walk.We choose a balcony room as I am a keen photographer and wanted to take some photos here from our hotel room without glass obstructing the view. The balcony was terrific...I can imagine in Summer this would a a sort after room as the balcony was possibly the same size as our room. As someone else mentioned, the bed was very close to one wall, and not much room to get into bed. A few stubbed toes but we managed. Expected a small room in NY but I think if the furniture was configured a bit differently, there would be more space. What was disappointing was when I sat on the chair to put on my shoes, I happened to notice all the “debris” that was around the base of the mattress (the bed is on a solid base). A bit off putting when the hotel is only a few months old.The breakfast was great, however, we could not find any water....juices coffee tea, but no plain water. The reception was capacity on the one night we were able to access it but very cramped.Big plus was the bar! The staff there were excellent...shared their knowledge of NY and were 5 Star. Very friendly and are a credit to the hotel.One suggestion to the hotel, we were given free bottled water the first night of our stay... why not the whole stay?

The room isn't really that small but when you cram a king bed, sleep out sofa and a desk (with a divider in the middle) into it there's not much ""walking around"" space. I will give them credit because they made use of every inch and despite the lack of open space the room has pretty much every amenity you need (refrigerator, microwave, ironing board, desk, two tv's, etc...). The only real issue I can see is that if you had a lot of luggage there's really not much space to store it and the closet/drawer space would be inadequate for a long stay.Other than the room size we had no complaints. Breakfast was excellent with cooked to order omelettes and a wide variety of hot and cold items as well as various juices and good coffee.

He told us that there were problems with the outlets in the headboard and that the hotel was in the process of fixing them but they hadn't gotten to our floor yet.

While we were waiting for ""the engineer"" to arrive, the row of lights above the window went out and then came back on a few minutes later. We told him about that problem, too, and his solution was to not turn on those lights, just use the other overhead lights. We also noticed a similar problem in the bar area when partaking of the happy hour one evening. A row of lights in the bar area went out and/or dimmed several times. There are issues with their electrical system and that needs immediate attention (we shared our concerns with the front desk). Don't mess with the safety of the people staying in your hotel.The happy hour was supposed to be from 5-7 p.m. A couple of evenings, because we were out being tourists during the day, we didn't arrive until about 6:20-6:30.

If they're not going to keep the snacks replenished the whole time of the advertised happy hour, they should note on their sign ""first come, first served on snacks"".

Aside from this there were just 2 drawers under the bed, one of which contained a safe. The lack of storage meant that our room was always very cluttered. In addition there was a full length mirror but half of this was hidden behind the bed. on my side I had a very narrow gap between bed and wall to get out. I'm a UK size 16 and I was squeezing so guests on the large size would find this very uncomfortable.2/ Similarly on design issues, the hotel reception is very overcrowded due to its size and there is nowhere else for departing guests to hang out . There is a huge water feature at the most crowded spot-if it doesn't disguise a structural necessity I would certainly get rid of it.There is also a bar area with tables-again given the crowded nature of the reception I'd remove these and replace them with more easy chairs.Would we stay here again? This is a great hotel for a short stay where you don't need loads of storage but for longer I think we'd look elsewhere just for this reason.","Barnsley, United Kingdom","KaraokeSue7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Barnsley, United Kingdom</strong>",123,3.0

I do recommend this hotel, staff was friendly and as busy as they were they seem to keep things moving both at breakfast and their evening reception. We came in for a girls weekend and stayed in a suite with a king bed and pull out couch. Now you must keep in mind that this is NYC so even though a suite it is still very small. It served it purpose of providing a clean sleeping environment and the hotel has a nice outside seating area if you felt a little cramped in the room. I loved that it was within walking distance of the square and that they offer a evening reception. Breakfast was top notch, please be aware of the signs that tell you the busiest breakfast times. I went early and no issue with finding seating or having plenty of options. My friends went later and said they had a hard time finding seating. I loved that they have a baggage check because we had taken the train into the city and scheduled a walking tour. The elevators are always busy so if you don't want to wait ask for a lower floor and you can take the stairs.

Which wasn’t much of an issue as we had planned on touring the city in the meantime. Our flight arrived at 11am and we had been walking around NYC for about 6 hours and really wanted to take a shower before we heading out for the rest of the night. We arrived back at the hotel at 4:45pm in aspirations of giving them a little more time to get the room ready for us. When we attempted to check in at this time, we couldn't because ""the room was ready but had yet to be inspected."" Normally this wouldn't have been a problem but we had already purchased (days in advance) Top of the Rock reservation tickets at Rockefeller for 5:15 – 5:30pm @ $40 apiece. We mentioned to the staff that we had these tickets and would like to get to our room as soon as possible, if only to just take a quick shower. The staff worker behind the counter couldn’t have cared less about our urgency and offered absolutely no resolution to the problem what-so-ever. (Cab, a different room, etc.) We were asked to wait in the lobby and that our room should be ready in “about 15 minutes.” It was at this time that we realized that we were not the only frustrated guest in the lobby waiting for a room. There must have been at least 10 other guest in the lobby waiting alongside us. Getting back down to Rockefeller was at least a 20 minute walk from the hotel, which meant it was highly unlikely that we could make it on time at that point. We tried to call Rockefeller (multiple times) but no one would answer and it states pretty clearly on the tickets that they do not offer any refunds. My fiancé actually attempted to change in the restroom down in the lobby with hopes that it would save time. By the time that the hotel had our room ready (5:15ish – 30 minutes later) there was no possibility of us making it to the reservation on time. We again tried to speak with the staff behind the check in counter about our frustration once the room was ready and again they stared at us as if saying nothing would just make us leave. After a moment of nothing a woman then said, “we wanted to make sure you had the Street side view that you requested.”We couldn’t have cared less about a room with a view. We just needed to quickly shower so we could get to our reservation. Had they asked us if we would be alright with a room that didn’t have a street-view. We would have gladly taken it, if it meant we could have made it to our reservation on time.This is hands down some of the worst customer service I have ever endured. At that point we had given them almost 2 hours (we were initially told check-in was 3pm over the phone) to ready the room. We in no way expected them to move mountains, however, we did expect them to be understanding and respectful of our time as we had been of theirs.",,Mordicad,1,1.0

The entire space was comprised of a comfortable king-size bed with a very-high backed couch pressed up almost next to it. On the other side of the false barrier was what seemed like a 2-foot wide aisle that comprised the other half of the 'suite'.

The suite is one room with a king sized bed separated by a high backed couch that folds out to a pretty good sized bed. This was perfect for one adult and two teens (one teen slept with me and the other took the foldout). 2 adults and one kid (or maybe two smaller kids) would also be fine. I don't think we would have enjoyed the room as much with two adults and two teens.3. Storage- space is tight, but if you utilize the drawers under the king bed (which store the foldout blanket/pillow), the small closet, and the nooks under the bedside shelves, then it is perfect. If you are more than 2 people traveling with larger than carry on suitcases, you may have trouble finding space for your luggage (regular king room likely has more open space than the suite).4. View- Wow! The window is not floor to ceiling, so the view is really only accessed by standing next to the window- but a high floor facing downtown will provide a stupendous view of the Empire State Building; the downtown skyline is in the distance. It may be that all rooms on the downtown facing side have the smaller windows. Floor to ceiling windows are supposedly not available (per front desk) in the suites. Uptown views are also nice (based on view that direction from elevators).5. Amenities- free daily breakfast was decent, with a variety of options. Evening reception from 5-7 is nice, though the snacks provided are pretty marginal (veggies and dip, maybe trail mix or soft pretzel bites, small cookies one night)- but most people seem to be there for the free drink. I didn't look at or use the fitness center, but there is one. The fridge and microwave in room were handy.We would definitely stay again.","Austin, Texas","614vickies</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",11,5.0

Not exactly sure why they branded it an ES since the rooms are small and not exactly suites...I was upgraded to the largest room they have which was divided into two parts by a tall piece of furniture but the whole room couldn’t have been 300 square feet. With all the stuff they’ve jammed into the room it feels a bit cramped. But everything was new and well thought out - lots of power outlets and lights where you need them, etc. The bathroom was small but had a great standalone shower. The bed was comfortable and the room was quiet. I had a spectacular view of the Empire State Building from my window. Really, I still can’t believe how much of the building I could see. The evening reception was disappointing. Sure, there was complementary beer and wine but there was a $5 up charge for anything other than draft Bud Light. Eeks. The snacks were just some bagged snack mixes and celery sticks (or carrots, I don’t remember). Better than nothing, sure, but just barely. Breakfast was very good. There is a unique omelette ordering system utilizing iPads attached to the wall. The omelette I had was made quickly and was quite tasty. Lots of other hot and cold items available on the buffet. I went very early and was the only person there both days but the breakfast room is tight so I imagine it gets very crowded. The lobby water feature is pretty cool but the elevators are pretty slow, especially around the happy hour. The location is great, at least for me. Lots of restaurants near by and very close to the ESB where I work when in NYC.All in all, I enjoyed the Embassy Suites and would definitely stay there again.

Breakfast was good - made to order eggs (use touch screen to order), bacon, sausage (pork or chicken), potatoes, pancakes, baked goods, yogurt, fruit, cereal, coffee and juices. Lots of seating room (two seating areas). Evening reception had mixed drinks, wine, beer, and finger foods. Dominique welcomed us when we arrived at 3:30 (check-in at 4) on a Sunday. There is no reserved space for load/unload in front of the hotel. When we pulled up, there was a space and we parked. No one from the hotel came out to greet us, give us a cart, help with directing us - even though there were several employees watching us from inside. My husband went in to ask about the procedure and someone came out to help with our bags and explain parking. Parking is around the corner on the next block - not too far. We had requested chocolate covered strawberries and cookies in the room for our anniversary. Our particular room was not ready yet, so Dominique went up to switch out “amenities” to a different room. While Dominique and other hosts were pleasant, it took over an hour to get into our room. Then the amenities were in the fridge in plastic boxes or on a plastic cover plate - not exactly what I had imagined. She did comp us the amenities and added another item for free as well. We left the room at 10:30am the next day only to come back to an unclean room at nearly midnight. The front desk did send up fresh towels. The next day the room was cleaned, but the hallways were not well vacuumed. The elevators are a bit tedious. Only 3 for over 30 floors. Going back up from breakfast was time consuming. For safety you can also only select floors that have breakfast and your room. Also, before getting your car to leave, you must have the claim ticket stamped by the hotel. All in all it was a great place to lay our head at night. Not noisy at all. The windows open a smidge for fresh air and we could see the Empire State Building and Macy’s at Herald Square from our room. I hope the hotel works out the kinks.

If you're a HH member, beware they will try to charge credit card on account prior to check in even if it’s not your ‘preferred’ card to guarantee reservation. Also, they charge for early check in so plan 4 pm check in. They will hold your bags if you arrive early or they have proper sitting areas for guests to relax. No water at check in. As there are few reviews for this brand new hotel, I will be detailed because if you’re like me, you want more info than ‘hotel was great.’ I booked Studio Suite w/ View high floor for 3 nights for Mom/Tween trip. This is one room divided like a studio apartment w/ bed and sitting area back-to-back. The sofabed had no linens and would have been hassle to deal with in cramped space, not sure where we’d put pillows, etc. so did not use. The king bed takes up most space in bedroom so kept hitting legs on platform to get around when getting up at night. However, the bed was comfortable with good linens and pillows. There was massive TV on wall at end of bed, approx. 50”. We enjoyed watching pay movie for $13. The ‘living area’ has sofabed w/ high back that serves as the ‘wall.’ between bedroom area There is counter w/ two chairs w/ second smaller TV on wall. The couch is only barrier so understand there is no real privacy if someone sleeping on sofabad and be loud if both tvs in use. We were on 27th floor. We did have view but out of small windows, odd design choice for new build. You have to stand at window to look up to see the ESB and down to Herald Square. One window opens slightly which was helpful to check weather. We heard normal city noise but nothing disruptive. We did not hear any other guests. Room has small closet, tiny refrigerator and micro, one of those two cup coffee makers, large safe and full-length mirror. I was thinking they should put up some hooks on wall for extra storage. The bathroom was small w/ walk-in shower, good counter space. I hated the smell and quality of the Neutrogena products but that is subjective. I liked that bathroom was away from sleeping area. Housekeeping is still work in progress. Our room was not touched upon return late afternoon first day. Front desk was rude when I asked why room not cleaned. I felt was legitimate question since we needed towels, trash emptied, etc. A sweet woman was sent up some 20 minutes later who spoke zero English so we had difficult time communicating. I gave her tip and room was attended on timely basis following days. You have to scan key card to use elevator to access all floors except when going down to lobby. The front desk fails to tell you this at check in so prepare to have key ready at all times. I'm usually not a big fan of chain hotel breakfast buffets but Embassy's was pretty great. They had everything you’d want including fruit, bagels, croissants, hot items and made-to-order eggs. The only thing missing was waffle maker. They need to get proper signage in place because nobody knew what direction buffet moved or where to order the eggs without asking. The coffee area also needs tweaking for better flow. The touch screen to order eggs is super easy (it’s on wall opposite cook) – I suggest bypassing entering your name/room info, it’s not necessary and time consuming. Just hit buttons for what you want and hit ORDER twice and they’ll call out your order when ready. They did run out and not replace items if within 30 minutes of end so best to go early (ends at 10 on weekdays, 10:30 weekends). There was never enough seating so we took food up to room (I saw some people w/ take-out boxes but never found them). It was my understanding hotel is not at full capacity so imagine breakfast will be hectic when hotel is full. Happy Hour w/ open bar from 5-7 was great surprise! The snacks offered looked basic so avoided so not to ruin appetite for dinner. I usually stopped in and grabbed glass of wine for room but many were hanging out, enjoying cocktails. Don’t forget to tip bartenders. This area of NYC is not prettiest but is very central to get up and downtown. Madison Square Garden/Penn Station and Bryant Park no more than 10 min walk and Times Square/Broadway 10 min. Macy's is two blocks away as is subway. We grabbed taxis with ease on corner of 6th/37th, don’t believe bellmen hail taxis. The hotel is on quiet side street. We had arrival driver from JFK pick us up to return. I'm not sure if hotel offers airport transport so plan ahead if needed. Bottom line is this is nice new hotel option understanding this is a ‘citified’ Embassy Suites and you don’t need proper suite or room w/ double/queen beds.",SC,"Melwyjak</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>SC</strong>",71,4.0

The staff was very friendly, the rooms were nice, location was great. One of the better breakfast buffets I've enjoyed at an Embassy Suite. Only inconvenience was having to use your key card in the elevator whereas you can use your phone as your key to your room, since you need a key card you might as well always just use a key and skip the mobile keycard.","Whitehouse, New Jersey","rxp188</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Whitehouse, New Jersey</strong>",108,5.0

Breakfast and reception were nice. I am a loyal Hilton member (silver) and was staying 3 nights last week for business. I got to the hotel early (10:30) and was charged $75 (later reduced to $50) for an early check-in fee. After complaining multiple times, they refused to cancel the fee - even when I indicated that I will never stay at their hotels again. Which I won't - there are too many other amazing places to stay in the city that don't charge if you get there early. So if you expect that you're going to want to get in your room before the 4:00 check-in, expect to pay. Poor customer focus - way to lose a loyal over $50!",RandBS,"RandBS</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>RandBS</strong>",13,2.0

Our room, a one bed king on the 30th floor, was a perfect base. Slightly larger than other ""king"" rooms I have stayed at in NYC. The bed was comfortable, the TV had a wide choice of channels and all in HD, the bathroom was big, the shower hot and good water pressure, microwave, coffee machine and a fridge. The buffet breakfast has it all covered, whether you want hot or cold, they have it covered and the selection changes daily, we stayed five nights and never got bored. It was a little busy at the weekend but during the week it was a lot quieter. Managers reception in the evening was well presented with house red / white and Bud and Bud lite all included. We ordered room service one evening which was good and came within twenty minutes. We also had the filet steak at the Heist one evening which I highly recommend.
