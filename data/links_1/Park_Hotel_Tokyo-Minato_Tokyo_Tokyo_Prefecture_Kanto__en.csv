We really liked the convenience of the train stations beneath the hotel. The location is in a non-touristy area so it was really neat to see the regular activity of Tokyo. The hotel had a nice breakfast - we paid for it only once though as it was a bit pricey. We couldn't pass up the convenience of the restaurant in the hotel at night though - after a long day of touring we really appreciated the good food. The bed was comfortable. The view from the room was nice - really cool to see the city buzzing down below. We could hear the trains go by - but it wasn't too disturbing. The room was perfect for what we needed. The staff was amazing - they were ready to help with any requests (extra towel, question on the area).

Although they do not assign rooms ahead of time we gave them a list of preferable rooms (if they were available) and got the geisha goldfish, which was incredible. The view of the Tokyo Tower made it even better.Staff was polite and helpful. They booked a few restaurant reservations we asked about beforehand and even gave us a map for how to locate them. The only slight downside is at one of the high end steak restaurants (Satou) they required you to book ahead of time certain meals, which we weren't aware of, so my husband was unable to get his meal of choice. On the English speaking websites we didn't see anything about this and can't blame the concierge, but just a note in the future would be helpful for the concierge to follow up with the restaurant if any additional reservations are required.All in all would recommend! Great location (close to subways) and was the perfect choice for our honeymoon and fit within our budget. The front desk was even kind enough to give us champagne and there were decorations as well in our room. Thank you for making our four days in Tokyo for our honeymoon a wonderful time.

We also ate in their Japanese restaurant one night (where they made some vegetarian ramen for me) and in their main restaurant with a more European flavour and it was all really good.

Very unique indeed. Had its own galleries on several floors and worth an hour or two just to look at all this within the hotel. Our regular room , albeit a bit small and with a very standard hotel interior, nonetheless had a great view of Tokyo Tower and this was especially breathtaking at night. There were some rooms decorated and painted by individual artists and each was unique and a work of art in itself literally, but we did not stay in one of these special rooms but took a regular one which was decent enough. All in all, this was quite a lovely stay during a sunny winter’s day in Tokyo and I would highly recommend this charming hotel to anyone who wants to try a hotel that is just a little different from the usual norm.

While part of a business tower, the hotel has a stylish aesthetic and stunning views. Our room had a fantastic view of the bay. The bed was ultra comfortable. While the bathroom felt a bit dated, the room was otherwise modern and well appointed. We really liked the hotel location. It’s very close to Ginza, which is an excellent neighborhood for great bars (eg Star Bar), restaurants, cafes (eg cafe de l’ambre) and shopping. Once we got oriented, we usually took the Park Hotel elevator to the subway level and walked through the underground from Shiodome station area to Shimbashi station to exit for our Ginza outings. Shimbashi station is also notable because of the Yamonote line. Since we had a JR pass, we could ride that line with our pass so it was convenient for getting around to key areas of the city like Shibuya and Shinjuku. The staff at the hotel were all incredibly friendly and helpful, especially as we had to receive a package to the hotel. The fitness centre is very tiny and can only be used by reservation. If you’re a fitness enthusiast, this might be a drawback. I never had issues with the booking system, though I didn’t always get my first choice. Considering a lot of hotels in Tokyo don’t have fitness centres at all or charge for them, I was satisfied with what this hotel offered. This was our second hotel in Tokyo.

We are finding Tokyo hard to navigate (English speaking with no Japanese) and getting to the hotel from the airport was tough. Google maps led us astray a few times and because the hotel is on the 25 floor it is not obvious (signage is small and discreet). We took the train from the airport and came above ground to find it.

This was exactly the same when I was there 2 years ago. Every time I entered the room, the lingering smell was pervasive.

They also made sure that someone who make sure the lounge was adequately stocked & erviced the following evening. Breakfast was great, there was enough variety for most palettes, and I especially appreciated the lovely early-morning breakfast the staff set up for us for our early departure.

There is also a branch of the Scotch Whisky Society (equally good and bad news for me since I spent a lot of money in there during our stay). Also a French style restaurant we did not try. The central lobby bar and breakfast area is also really good and one of the best caipirinhas in Tokyo is available there. Our 34th floor room was modestly sized, well equipped and had a fantastic view over Shimbashi and the surrounding area.

Lashing rain and driving winds pummelled the building and it was disconcerting.

The hotel location makes it very easy to get to from either airport using Airport Limousine bus since they drop you off directly at the hotel. There are many ways but it’s the easiest if you have large suitcases.We choose an artist room 3101 with south facing view with the hopes of seeing Mt Fuji...unfortunately it was cloudy all four days. I also choose an artist room since it gave us the privilege of their special room offering juices, pastry and hot beverages in morning and during evening red & wine. This was a very nice perk since after a long day of playing tourist you could enjoy a glass of wine. We found the hotel staff extremely accommodating and always smiling. I used the laundry facilities once b/c it was so humid and we change clothes frequently. I appreciate the hotel having this facility since many do not and you are stuck with paying hotel laundry prices. The only issue I had was that these two washers are washer & dryer combo. So wash and dry for a small load was $4-5 but they provided detergent. They washed and dried but they didn’t wring out enough liquid so the clothes was still wet. So if you are thinking of using washer plan to pay another 400 yen (30 mins per 100 yen) to dry.We also paid extra ~$25 pp for breakfast. Hubby thought price was steep but I thought it was the going rate for Asian breakfast in Tokyo. Since we were staying on the artist floor we could have had pastries, juices & coffee and tea complimentary but l like larger breakfast to start the day so I choose to pay.

The BEST thing about this hotel was we arrived on an early morning flight and arrived at hotel at 9am and were able to check in to our room immediately.

The area is safe, with lots of restaurants near by, I suggest to go to the Shiodome where you can find nice restaurants, we had diner Bacio di Guilietta, an Italian Trattoria for a descent price. Hotel is also at a walking distance (about 15 min) from the old fish market (Tsuki-ji) which is a must do when you are in Tokyo.Hotel: Lobby at the 25th floor with a nice view on Tokyo Tower.

Somewhat spacious for a downtown area, coffee machine, HDTV (if you don't mind watching Japanese channels), air conditioning, a little bar with liquor and soft drinks.

Hopefully my review this time is a bit more helpful in explaining why you should select this as your hotel.The Hotel itself takes up floors 25-34 of a high-rise structure, with 34 being artist rooms. There is art throughout the hotel and even projected onto a 10 story inside wall of the hotel atrium, it’s really nice. The lobby is great and offers incredible views and has nice bars and restaurants. It’s a nice place to enjoy people watching and relaxing. It is a very welcoming area, but to me the price of food is a bit much. At 9 USD a coffee I had to decline even though I was sitting with family. The Whiskey Bar has an amazing selection and a nice atmosphere to unwind after a long flight or day. It has a really unbelievable selection of craft beers and local whiskey. The food selection was good as well.The corner view king is a great way to go for more space and a nice view. There are four very large windows with a full view of the Tokyo Tower and other buildings. I think some queen Tokyo tower views have even better views due to buildings blocking out the tower base, but corner king is very large. The room has all the essentials, razor, shaving cream, toothbrush, etc. It’s very functional and nice.The location is 5-10-minute walk to Shimbashi and the Tokyo Loop, you can buy 1 day passes there for about 6 USD and enjoy full use of the subway until midnight the same day. Shiodome station and taxis are plentiful on the first floor and basement level. There is also a Family Mart, which has everything you might need and is very similar to a US 7/11 – water, beer, snacks, everything you need for the room at very affordable prices. Also, there are dozens of nice restaurants in the Shidome City Center, a short 5-minute walk with dozens and dozens of bars etc. It’s a bit corporate but is a nice introduction to the area. Hong Hu Giao Zi Fang on the 2nd floor had good food and comfortable seating, friendly place. There is also sky dining a 2 minute walk away in the Caretta Shidome building, five star views and food, but very casual before the dinner rush.The price, cleanliness, stellar service, amazing views, and a great location make it hard to beat.

There was not lots to do within the direct vicinity of the hotel, however, this was not a problem as we had a full itinerary of things to do whilst in Tokyo and it did not take long to reach any of these places. We had a triple room and the size of the room was great, very spacious and affording nice views of Tokyo. The room was very clean and had all the amenities we required. Staff were very friendly.

The hotel itself is quirky situated above the media building it has an artistic focus with lounge, restaurant and corridor walls displaying a variety of art work. The rooms were compact but this is not unusual for a city centre. The great thing about it was the picture window over looking the Tokyo Tower and for a short time when the clouds cleared Mount Fuji.Unfortunately this was not the ideal stay we would have expected. On booking in the receptionist was brusquely move aside by another lady who did not welcome us but became fixated by the fact that we would be booking out early and what did we want to do about our pre-booked breakfast as the restaurant would not be open at that early. Breakfast became the issue of the stay. On our first morning we arrived for breakfast to find a couple of slices of cold meat the plate was not replenished. The hot food was tepid so not really enjoyable. When I went to get hot water for tea the jug was almost empty so I asked for more . This request was not heeded instead the member of staff insisted on draining the jug of its almost cold remains. We did mention our disappointment at reception. Arriving earlier on other mornings we found cold meat and hot water but still tepid cooked hot food.On the day of our departure at 5.30am my husband went ahead of me to book out. When I arrived with luggage I found that we needed our travel documents to prove that our breakfasts had been pre-paid.For us except for the staff who help us with our luggage we did not find the staff as helpful or attentive as we had during the rest of our stay in Japan.

Typical rooms and facilities etc. We booked a “Tower View” room and yes we could see the old Tokyo Tower and south across the city. When we checked in, on a rainy day, the staff mentioned that on a clear day you could see Mt Fuji from the reception area. In fact it turned out the tower view rooms also have a Mt Fuji view if the sky is clear (which doesn’t happen that often, but luckily for us it cleared on our last morning). It has a mostly convenient location that’s close to the Ginza area and stations. So what’s quirky? The location is decidedly unusual and a bit hard to get your head around. For a start it’s on the top of an office block with reception on the 25th floor. The best access is underground through a network of passages that lead to the stations, shops and restaurants. It’s an “art” hotel which doubles as a kind of art gallery. Despite the name there are no nearby parks. It has a glass outside lift. It’s right the middle of a modern commercial area so there’s no “old Japan” atmosphere in the vicinity.

I was fortunate to be allocated The Castle (you find out which room you've been assigned after checking in) as it was super cool, featuring fabulous artwork by Kazuki Mizuguchi. This included beautiful, meticulous and elegant castle renditions spanning three walls, with associated imagery covering the ceiling and other wall space. To make it even more special, the castle was reflected in the windows at night, superimposed on the Tokyo's night landscape. In his statement the artist linked this with thoughts of reality, illusion, transience and impermanence. It looked amazing. Everything else at the hotel was good as well. The 31st floor had an art concierge in situ every day to assist artist-room guests and each morning there were complimentary pastries and hot drinks for those guests. There were three art exhibitions (31st, 32nd and 35th floors) with work for sale and also a large video installation stretching upwards from the reception lobby into the central space which could be viewed from all floors. On the reception level there were some excellent ceramics and other items for sale. Staff were courteous and attentive. I'd booked a queen-sized room and it was spacious with a comfortable bed, choice of pillows, window seat, easy chair, footrest, table and desk. The red curtains and other decor complimented the art. Adjustable lights (I liked that they could be very bright, not always the case in Japan) and air conditioning. Lots of storage and hanging space, safe, fridge (with mini bar), decent-sized tv (with the first thing that comes on being evacuation info - admirable), full-sized mirror, cups & glasses. Adjoining powerpoints spaced so both could hold transformers at the same time (yay). Yakata and in-house slippers. Bathroom was a good size too with ample bench space for cosmetics etc, and complimentary toiletries were provided. Apart from the joy of the castle, there were great views of Tokyo in several directions and I enjoyed watching the trains coming and going. The hotel's location is excellent, next to Shiodome Station and with Shimbashi Station across the way, so easy access to most Tokyo destinations. There's a wide range of shops and eateries in the vincinity. Taxi rank outside and staff arranged for me to travel to the airport via reasonably-priced limousine (shuttle) which only stopped at about four places.

The check-in and arrival experience is all extremely proper and polite.The King Artist room was a reasonable size with a great view and all the facilities you'd expect. The only thing missing was an iron and ironing board in the room which when you ask for from housekeeping you will receive a miniature ironing board about 2 foot long with 6 inch legs that sits on the table (or on the floor) and is entirely impractical. Although entertaining to your other half as you sit on the floor attempting to iron 6 shirts.All rooms on the 31st floor - artist rooms - come with a free breakfast of pastries or toast in the gallery room which was really nice. And you can also pop in there to get a half decent coffee when you like too.I stayed in a regular room on the last night and it was interesting to compare, it is a little bit smaller, with slightly less room around the bed. It's also far less glamorous and looks a little more tired. I got the feeling that the artist rooms were a great excuse to give some old rooms a fresh lick of paint which these regular rooms are in need of. The shower in the regular room also left a lot to be desired and could do with a refurb.The only other real negatives for me was that I wanted to have a business meeting / chat with a customer I'd arranged to meet at my hotel and was told that to hire a meeting room would cost me 17500 yen per hour. This came as a shock when most hotels I've been in elsewhere will often find you a room for free, or at most £50 for a couple of hours. The receptionist really couldn't give a hoot when I said this seemed high. I guess that's just their rate they have to charge, maybe this is normal in Tokyo? The porter helpfully told me to just use one of the sofas and tables in the lobby which I did for free arriving 30 mins before my meeting to secure a good one!I was also surprised to find out on leaving the hotel that 3 coffees I'd bought in the lobby bar had cost me over 2700 yen. But again maybe this is normal for hotels, the receptionist seemed to surprised I cared.It left a bit of a negative impression on an otherwise perfectly good hotel. I'd probably come back just to stay and make sure I go elsewhere for anything else.","Yorkshire, United Kingdom","extra0rdinary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yorkshire, United Kingdom</strong>",10,3.0

You can easily get there on the airport limousine bus. We used the underground walkway to go to Shimbashi station every day, the map provided by the hotel was very useful. There are 3 Family Mart convenience stores between Shimbashi station and the hotel. We didn’t use Shiodome station as Shimbashi has so many train lines. The foyer/atrium area of the hotel is beautiful with gorgeous artwork. However, I agree with previous reviewers that the hallways and rooms could do with updating. We requested and received Mt Fuiji and Tokyo Tower views, a spectacular view (same view from reception desk). There was a wide window seat to sit on to admire the view. Our city view room was a reasonable size for Tokyo. The bathroom was small, usual for Tokyo, with a shower curtain over a bath tub. Plenty of bathroom amenities provided (shampoo, conditioner, foldable hairbrush, cotton buds, shower cap and hair tie, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razor and so on). There was a small mini bar, kettle and tea/coffee provided but no milk. I bought milk from Family Mart. The beds are very comfortable: firm mattress with both a soft Western pillow and a firmer Japanese pillow (only one side of the Japanese pillow had beans so, if you don’t like the beans, you can just turn it over).There is a coin laundry on 26th floor but we didn’t use it. We also didn’t use the gym or Thann spa. I am coeliac and I find Japan a difficult place to find gluten free food. So I was pleased to see that the Western food at breakfast had allergy labels for a variety of allergies. It wasn’t the most extensive breakfast buffet but included eggs cooked in several ways, bacon, sausages, vegetables, salad, yoghurt, fruit, cereals, pastries and cold meats. The Japanese breakfast unfortunately didn’t include allergy labels (except for the miso soup) and I would suggest that the hotel provides these in future. We ate dinner in the hotel once. Again not an extensive menu but there were 2 types of gluten free pasta. For non coeliacs, there were Western and Japanese options for dinner. The staff were all very professional and helpful, they are an asset to the hotel. We had a couple questions and they were promptly and thoroughly answered. I speak Japanese so had no language problems. We travelled with friends who don’t speak Japanese and they said that the staff spoke excellent English.I would recommend this hotel for its excellent service and location. Just keep in mind that the city view rooms aren’t as gorgeous as the foyer/atrium area (maybe try one of the artist rooms).","Sydney, Australia","Belinda M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",33,4.0

Food quality excellent. However menu very limited. Art work throughout hotel is really impressive, beautiful and lively. A superb 5 star amenity. Housekeeping was excellent. Shampoo and full array of amenities including razors, qtips, etc were kept well stocked. Large king bed. Beautiful view of Mt Fuji and Tokyo tower (king corner room). Shower was excellent though not a walk-in and tub floor was very slippery with no matt to prevent slipping. Room size was not expansive, but for Tokyo, at this price, a great value. Breakfast buffet was good, ambience is great, quiet jazz in a beautiful enclosed atrium with extensive art collection. Service level is outstanding. People know english and are exceedingly polite and helpful. On the food side, it was the tale of two extremes. Very good and poorly executed. Overall selection was excellent. Warm, cold, American, European, Japanese and other selections all of high quality except somethings were not fully cooked. Specifically the first day the chicken sausage was atone cold. After pointing this out to the chef, he was very apologetic and thoroughly cooked the saunas again and brought it to our table. The next couple days he brought me well cooked sausage (this was a buffet). So they handled the issue well for me. Though not sure if temp was properly maintained. Other issue was the scrambled eggs: if 0= raw and 10 = well done, they were a 0.5 every morning. Disgusting. Luckily they had delicious well cooked frittatas and hard boiled eggs, so we were ok. But just looking at a huge tray of mushy eggs was revoltingly. Having said that, everything else was excellent including the wide selection and quality. The hotel is beautiful in every way except the hallway carpeting. Clearly the room carpet had been replaced, the flooring is very nice everywhere except beyond the elevator foyer on the room floor levels. After the beautiful wood floor outside the elevators, the carpeting is very very old and stained. If they spent a few books to recarpet these hallways they would not clash so bad with the great artwork throughout the hotel. Overall excellent stay and a GREAT value.

Let’s just say it’s not easy to find a high quality yet cheap 3-person rooms in Tokyo with great views AND is close to the metro!The hotel itself is not the easiest the find - it is best to access via level 3 (pedestrian bypass) rather than ground level. This is because there are very few crossings on ground level which means you have to walk up the stairs to cross the road via the pedestrian bypasses in order to get to the entrance of the main building entrance on level 1/ground level.The hotel is located right next to Shiodome station (Oedo and Yurikamome lines), but is also a short 5 minute walk away from the main Shimbashi station which has access to JR, Ginza, Asakusa and Yurikamome lines. It was easy enough to travel from Narita airport via the Sky access train which takes you directly from airport to Shimbashi station in an hour and 20 minutes. On arrival we were politely greeted by all staff who then promptly checked us in. As I booked via Expedia I had VIP benefits - which consisted of a welcome drink each and also a complimentary bottle of water per person per night. I had booked the room with Tokyo tower view and we couldn’t have arrived at a more perfect time - we could see the sunset, Tokyo tower and Mt Fuji - it was an amazing view!The toiletries were of good quality and quantities!! They provided shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, body lotion, shaving kit, small washing towel (bit like loofah material), toothbrush/toothpaste, shower cap + hair tie. In addition to this they also had tea/coffee making facilities, room slippers, robes and fabric/air freshener provided.I would highly recommend this hotel - staff were all super friendly and it’s in a great location with good access to public transport and close to local attractions.

Staying on the 32nd floor with a wonderful view across the city for 5 nights and on our last night we moved one floor to an artists room on the 31st floor. Due to length of stay we received 1 free breakfast coupon which I used. To be honest as in most places on our trip this was one thing we would not recommend. To my mind heavily overpriced (if paying) to sit in a vast space which is the bottom of the atrium and the choices were okay but not very exciting. Far better to walk a few minutes to a local cafe or similar - in our case we went to the Excelsior Cafe every day just across the first walkway outside at 3rd floor exit. The rooms were spacious and the beds comfortable with amazing views - and we were lucky enough on our last morning that the weather particularly good and off in the distance we could see Mount Fuji. The artist room was interesting but not sure would pay the extra for more than one night although as a resident on that floor had access to a small lounge there where free wine and hot drinks throughout the day.

We are both retired and have been to Tokyo a number of times . Thought this hotel was good value , make sure you use the various price comparison sites as big variation in prices ( surprisingly I found the hotels own site was the cheapest).We stayed in a city queen room . You can pay extra for the 'artist' queen room . Might be ok for a couple of nights , but only same size as non artist room so we didn't think it worth all the extra money for two week stay. We found the room size adequate , wardrobe quite big so after putting most of our stuff in wardrobe , just put our cases in corner by window and quite happy with amount of space . We could see Hamarikyu Gardens from window . Only ten minutes away so make it one of your first visits . Beautiful park.Takes a little while to orientate yourself to the area . We used our first morning doing that, couple of hours checking out Shimbashi area.We mostly used Shiodome station . My tip for finding hotel when arriving at Shiodome station is .. follow signs that have 'exit 7-10' on . (or 7-8) .After couple of minutes and a couple of escalators later you will see a large raised flower bed .Keep to right and take diagonal across to door with Park Hotel sign on ( just ask if you get lost , everyone very helpful)Before going it is well worth getting a Pasmo card , it's like the London Oyster card , makes things so much easier .I think you can prepay for one before your holiday otherwise you can get one at airport station .Re getting around , we are a couple of pensioners yet have found it very easy because we use HyperDia , just put in departure station , arrival station and it comes up with all the info you need ( what platform , where to change etc The hotel has a loyalty scheme . Worth joining as there are a couple of freebies depending on your length of stay . We got 4 complimentary breakfasts . You also get English language paper pushed under door every day .To join loyalty scheme go to the FAQ page on hotel website, scroll down to Amenities and Services then click the link .The breakfast is good but about £20 .Also it is served in the large atrium that the rooms are built around . You are surrounded by art but we found it a bit too formal and quiet ,like having breakfast in a cathedral . If you just want something cheap and a bit noisier then there is a Tullys nearby , about a fiver for breakfast set .(Lift to 3rd floor then turn right through corridor with lots of local art in , turn right at exit , Tullys is by station entrance .)Just one more thing re food , if you are vegetarian/vegan then there is an excellent restaurant nearby called Chaya . When you come out of 3rd floor exit you will see the famous Ghibli clock on your left . Go down stairs next to it , you will see Rose and Crown pub (overpriced , seek out one of the Hub bars nearby in Shimbashi)Opposite pub in right hand corner is Chaya restaurant.We will stay at Park Hotel again .","St Helens, United Kingdom","BillyBMerseyside</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St Helens, United Kingdom</strong>",38,5.0

The artist’s paintings on the Washi paper on the walls were very beautiful and a great introduction to Japanese painting. We loved it!The Artists Floor has its own Concierge, and a small lounge with free drinks available (not open 24 hours a day though).The room was clean and very quiet, with great views towards the Tokyo Tower, and the bathroom was spotless with plenty of toiletries.On arrival, it wasn’t really very clear where to go – the hotel occupies floors 25 to 34 of the Shiodome Media Tower, and so we knew reception was on the 25th floor, but there were no big signs pointing you towards the lifts when you stepped out of a taxi at ground level. We did find them though, and later learnt that you took one of these lifts to get to the underground level that led to Shimbashi station (oh, what a warren that underground area is ... be warned!!!). The staff on Reception were helpful, though check-in took quite a long time, and were great in assisting us organise our luggage transfer to our next destination. The Concierge girls were particularly helpful when we finally left with all our luggage to catch our return flight.Breakfast was buffet style, and good, with plenty of choice of Western or Japanese food.We ate in their Hanasanshou (Japanese) restaurant on our first and last nights in Japan. We had a sushi platter and mixed tempura both times. The first night it was very good and the service prompt, but unfortunately our second visit wasn’t as good – the service was slow and our waitress seemed not to be at all engaged in serving us, and the food itself also suffered as the tempura certainly wasn’t as hot as it should have been. We did mention our disappointment to a manager, but no compensation was offered.Other evenings, we ate in the basement level of the next-door Caretta Shiodome, finding some interesting and inexpensive places to eat, and quite often being the only non-Japanese in the restaurant (which we were very happy about!).All in all, with its location near Shimbashi station, and the lovely room that we had, we would heartily recommend staying at the Park Hotel in Tokyo.","Richmond, Surrey","LP-UK</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Surrey</strong>",78,5.0

It’s personal preference but we preferred the shinjuku area of Tokyo (over an hour away from here) so would probably stay there is we went back (a bit more life - feels a bit more ‘Japanese’).","Bewdley, United Kingdom","Teamporsereturns</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bewdley, United Kingdom</strong>",75,4.0

We enjoyed great breakfasts in the atrium dining room, had friends visit us for drinks & cakes. A great 2 day stay at the hotel, another nice touch was that as we were leaving one member of staff came down to the ground floor to ensure we caught the right bus to the airport – many thanks.

While searching for hotels my top priorities were on that was closed to my meetings in Toyosu, a reasonable sized room, free WiFi, proximity to a Narita Express stop, Tsukiji fish market and dive restaurants/bars, a lovely view of the city and supports the needs of foreigners for our 6 night stay. Yes, that was a laundry list. I did find all that in the Park Hotel Tokyo.Arrival via taxi was typical. No doorman at the ground level which was fine for this price level of hotel. There are 3 standard hotel size elevators which take you to the 25th floor for check-in. Although only one takes you to B2 to access the underground passage way to the Shiodome stations (Oedo line & Yurikamome) Shimbashi station, and the Tokyo Shiodome Building which houses the global headquarters of Softbank as well as some good western style breakfast café options. If you prefer to walk outdoors, take the elevator to level 3 for the elevated walkway for access to the same. By the way, being situated near the start of the Yurikamome line gives you a good chance of getting one of the 3 seats out the front of the train giving you wonderful views of the Rainbow Bridge, Odaiba and the 2020 Olympic village under construction. Check-in was smooth and a friendly staff member helped take our bags as he directed us to our room. We were welcomed to a clean well-prepared Tokyo Tower view room with a something little extra which I had requested for my spouse. The room’s A/C unit was struggling a bit the first day under what I was told record 37C temperature / 43C heat index. (My colleague from Tampa, FL mentioned it was hotter than home.) Although it regained control as the outside temperature returned to summer norms over the next few days. The window seat bench and the accompanying seat cushion is a nice touch although you may not sit for long if you are afraid of heights. There is enough room between the desk/vanity and the drapes to fit our 30” Samsonite suitcase. There is a modest size closet with in-room safe. The queen size bed is a bit on the firmer side. The sound insulation was generally very good. I never heard my neighbors, guests in the hallways or water flowing through the pipes, although you can hear the muffle of the trains to/from the Shimbashi station. Perhaps because our room is west facing, the winds from Typhoon Jongdari (38mph sustained / 50mph gusts as measured at nearby Haneda) were not perceptible from our room other than the calming noise of a few raindrops hitting the window and what sounded like a metal window sash. A local friend of ours helped pick up a local SIM card at a store on the other side of the Shimbashi station where there are many dive bars and restaurants available. There are a few Irish pubs in the neighborhood. The hotel offers a nice brochure of the best restaurants in the area for the various types of Japanese cuisine, Ramen, Teppenyaki (think Benihana but better food quality and typically 2x the cost), Izakaya, and Sushi.The English fluent front desk is staffed 24 hours a day which suffering from jet lag was welcome as I found myself working most effectively in the very early morning hours from the business center situated right next to the check-in desk. I spent several hours over the six days and found the two desks very comfortable with extra plugs for your laptop. I was able to fit my 2 laptops comfortably on the desk even with the large iMac present on each desk. Most of the plugs in the hotel & all plugs in the room are the US style 2-prong. I found only one US 3-prong electrical outlet in the business center. I recommend bringing an adapter if you plan on using a device with a 3-prong plug just in case. The desk chairs are really comfortable and the lower lumbar cushion is a very nice feature on the chairs. I wish I had the same chair at my desk in the office.The 2 coin operated laundry machines were a bonus. While the modes are limited, I threw in some t-shirts, undershirts and our undies even mixing (gasp) colors with whites without issue. I went with the 1.5kg wash mode which includes laundry detergent and a damp dry mode. This was good experience marred only by finding the front loading washer a bit dirty and I had to clean some left over junk from inside of the tub. The damp dry mode is fine. I hung our clothes using the over bathtub clothes line and the hangers in the closet. After about 4 hours in our air conditioned room my clothes were dry and my cotton undershirts were just as soft as if I had thrown a sheet of fabric softener with them in the dryer at home. Clothes that I laid flat on the bed or on the chair did not fare as well. Check-out was smooth and the front desk staff was kind enough to ask where we were headed next and prepared a card in Japanese for me to present to the Taxi driver. We had a great stay and I look forward to my next visit. I'll try the on premises restaurants next time.","San Jose, California","WillieC573</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",48,5.0

They have a small room with free coffee, drinks and breakfast. The service is very good as they gave me a few ideas on where to walk around.

We flew into Haneda T1 and got the monorail from the station at the airport to Hamamatsucho and then walked out of this station to change to the metro at Daiman. this is a very short distance from Hamamatsucho. Shiodome is one stop on the E line eastbound. Tickets are relatively cheap but suggest you buy the 24h pass if you intend to travel around Tokyo. Works out at less than 1000 yen for 2 people.The hotel reception is welcoming with an art expo concept which is well worth viewing. Staff are attentive and helpful. We arrived just before 8am so had to wait until 12pm for our room to be available so we sat in the lobby next to the dining area for a few hours. Suggest you consider popping into Tokyo to eat up some time!The hotel lobby is on the 25th floor and we were allocated a room on the top floor (34) which has magnificient views of the city. The room was clean with a great view and there is also a cushioned window sill so you can sit and admire the skyline from your room! Our room was fairly small so having big cases provided a challenge. There is a room safe but bizarely, this was sat on top of a very small shoe rack which was not attached to the wall or floor so could be physically picked up and moved........There are a number of restaurants in the hotel (which closed at 21.00) but we did not eat here, instead we ventured out to Shimibashi which is a 10 minute walk from the hotel main lobby. This is a vibrant and bustling area full of street bars, noodle shops and eateries crammed with locals. A bowl of ramen plus a beer for 2 people cost around 2,800 yen which is very cheap and thoroughly recommended if you want to attempt some sort of authentice Japanese eating experience. We ate there every night during our 4 night stay. There are also many convenience stores in the vicinity for snacks, alcohol and water should you need this.Overall, a great hotel in a great location and thoroughly recommended.","Chester, Northwest England, UK","TheRidders</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chester, Northwest England, UK</strong>",30,4.0

On my lengthy 23 day trip to Tokyo I saved this experience to the very end. Traveling solo I did not need a king sized bed so I opted for a queen size bed/room. I got the Cherry Blossom Room on the 31st floor! I love art and really appreciated the theme and this artists unique take on cherry blossoms. Nothing says transformation more than a butterfly!!! For this particular room, the westerly facing view was spectacular. Room had a partial view of the Tokyo Tower. At night, the view was even more amazing. Room had a window bench which was awesome!!! I must have sat and view the night sky for a few hours while enjoying some hot green tea. I found the room accommodations to be excellent for this class of hotel. The staff at the hotel were very kind and helpful even with my broken Japanese. Many people did speak enough English so we were able to communicate. The staff also made sure, with an envelop under my door, to note extra amenities that were occurring during my stay. This extra note, blew my mind, I mean this little extra touch was unexpected and raised my experience to a whole new level. The hotel did not want me to miss out on any part of what their hotel had to offer. As a result, I made every effort to experience every offering! I was lucky enough to stay during a open art gallery exhibit at the hotel which also enhanced my stay. I mean having a free art gallery in the same hotel was so incredible. I love art so this was super fun. I dined in 3 of the 5 restaurants and each had their own style and service. The ""kaiseki"" or traditional Japanese multi-course meal was the better meal I had at the hotel. Although, I also loved the Asian style buffet which offered Chinese style dumplings which I am a big fan. All the food was fresh enough which was expected for Japan and any hotel of this 4 star caliber. Don't hesitate to ask for the best food experience or recommendations. I did have better food on my trip outside of this hotel but that is not to say the food was terrible. I am just saying it was good just not over the top mind blowing. I did walk away from all of my dining experiences full and satisfied just not mind blown, I hope this makes sense. If you enjoy art and want a unique room and hotel experience then you should consider the Park Hotel Tokyo.

I was not happy with the initial room I'd been allocated so I went to speak to reception who were wonderfully helpful and understanding and kindly showed me an alternative room. The situation could have been awkward but it was handled with kindness and professionalism.The room is a good size with air conditioning and safe. The bed was really comfortable too. I loved sitting in the window (daytime and evening time) watching the bustle of the trains, cars, and people down below. From the Hotel, you have direct access to the train line at Shiodome Station, and it's only a short walk to Shimbashi Station with several Lines (it can be confusing but once you've done it once, it's very easy)We took a short taxi ride (there are always taxis waiting out front) from the hotel to the Monorail Station to access Haneda Airport - you could walk if you don't have too much luggage.

When this hotel didn’t they continued to make phonecalls to try and find crutches for sale in Tokyo. After about 20 phonecalls and a lot of internet searching they concluded that a doctor’s appointment was needed to buy crutches. Our travel insurance also suggested a visit to a doctor. Concierge was again very understanding and helpful and booked an appointment for us with an knee orthopaedic specialist.

All charged to my credit card.......more points for me :):)Personnel was awaiting our arrival to the hotel and coordinate our luggage to the check in floor. Personnel were extremely friendly and spoke very good English. We were checking into the 30th floor - we reserved a Queen bed room with city view. Best decision made. At night with the lights out in the room, we could view the lights of the city with a glass of wine in our hands.The rooms are small. Just enough room to place on the floor 2 large suit cases. More or less the same size of a balcony cabin on a cruise ship. Bathroom has a very deep tub. Great water pressure and plenty of hot water. There is no shower spout. there is a hand held shower unit that hangs. Only item I found not favorable. The toilet has a warming unit plus other items to wash one self . Plenty of amenities plus extra razor, brush, tooth brush / paste, Room has a Frig and safe. Plus coffee / tea supplies. The hotel is walking distance to the luxury shopping area. In the basement you can get subway transportation to all areas in Tokyo. We took the train to the Asakusa area. Was 200 yen per person each way. Took 15 minutes. In addition there are eating areas approx 300 feet from the hotel exit door. Note many places do not open until 7:00 or till 7:30am in morning. Places open later on weekends. So coffee not available until 7:30am........including Big Mac. There are Family Stores for general items needed in case you forgot something plus other places for limited shopping.The hotel does have a western breakfast. Cost is around 2300 yen........while a breakfast Mac meal goes for 600-800yen.......Internet was great in the hotel.........no trouble using.We coordinate with the hotel for air port shuttle to Haneda - cost for 2 around 1800 yen. This was on a normal touring bus. Allow 4 hours from hotel - pick ups, etc, and getting to international terminal. Bus hits 2 other places prior to this terminal. We allowed 3 hrs and were lucky in checking in and by passed a long waiting line. We had just 45 minutes to get a small meal and a drink. If we had to wait in the long line we would have just made the plane.........Traffic to the airport can get very heavy so allow more time then expected...........Most taxi drivers do not speak English. Or very limited. So have printed data on where you want to go........We did find it interesting that there is no trash cans. You are expected to take your own trash with you for disposal. Also there is no smoking in shopping areas. There are fines. Streets are very clean.",L.A. Calif,"Jam_macL_A_Calif</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>L.A. Calif</strong>",40,5.0

The Park Hotel has larger rooms available. Instead of booking their standard room, I suggest moving up a notch to their deluxe rooms. They are larger and though a little more expensive, worth the extra money. If you look on the hotel's website, I think they tell you how big the rooms are.They have a Japanese restaurant, Hanasanshou. It's small so you might want to make a reservation.

I read many of the reviews and agree with most of them. First, the hotel is located near the subway which is a major plus. But you should know that navigating your way is very difficult. My wife is a Japanese American and all I did was follow. If alone, I would still be in the subway trying to either get to where I wanted or get back to the Park. Now, back to the Park Hotel. I read many of the review and agree with most. It is an exceptional hotel for what you pay. But when people rate it 5 Stars, do not expect the same elegance you would get at a Four Seasons or other hotel whose name alone is sufficient to deserve a 5 Star rating. But at the Park, you can expect 5 Star service. Everyone was friendly, helpful, considerate, and did their best to accommodate us. The concierges were great. Most of the staff knew English and we always felt very comfortable. The Park is a really a wonderful compromise between the very pricy hotels and the very inexpensive ones. If we came back, we will stay here again.When on line and booking, check room sizes. They have smaller rooms and larger. We booked a deluxe room and were very happy. Remember, you get what you pay for and if upgrading only cost $30 or $40 a night, it is worth it. I am never happy with saying I will only sleep in the room so what difference does it make. When in the room, I want it to be comfortable. If you are not looking for the world, you should be, as we were, very happy when you choose the Park Hotel.

We were on the 32nd floor, and looked over the surrounding buildings and a park, which, even in February, was filled with gorgeous flowers and a few early cherry and plum blossoms.

You quickly get used to finding your way round. The complex is very well connected with both various underground lines and also the Japan Railway lines (our three year old loved that you could see Shinkansen every few minutes down below). There are numerous small places to get in the connected towers (there must be 20-30 different small restaurants). We went to a few of them and they were quite good and relatively inexpensive.The room we had was quite small which we understand is normal for Tokyo but it was clean and well maintained. The breakfast buffet was included in our rate, there was a good range of mainly western style food with some of the items rotating on a daily basis to give some variety.

If you are a business person and have to work in the neighbourhood then this hotel may be ok. In my opinion for a tourist it is not a good option. My first room had a view of a rail yard, my second room had a good view.The Not So Good: The hotel is in the middle of a massive office complex with a ring of highway, rail, subway and monorail. To get around by foot you have to use a complex network of overpasses. It is impossible to easily walk around the area or figure out where you are. The signage to the hotel is poor. My first room was noisy from the trains, and I was on the 32nd floor. I asked to be moved which the front desk did without question. The second room was much quieter. The hall carpet was stained in many areas. The room was basic, furnished much like a generic Hilton or Hampton Inn. A small 21' TV rounded out the room (the remote did not work). The bathroom was clean and the shower consisted of a very basic hand held facet in an old fashion bathtub, The shower head was tiny, similar to what you would find in the clearance bin at Home Depot.Location: As I said for connections to HND it is good but you are a very limited, there are no restaurants or other retail, other than a Family Mart. The restaurants in the office complex were closed in the evening. There are restaurants in the hotel and nearby hotels but they tend to be costly.

But it's also right on top of the Shiodome station, which sits on the Oedo line that and provides very quick access to the many attractions in Roppongi, Shibuya, etc. Family Mart in the same building, and just adjacent to a McDonalds and Taco Bell if you need fast food.View/rooms - To die for. I'll never forget falling asleep to a gorgeous, night lit Tokyo, and waking up to a sea of buildings bathed in golden sunrise and a great view of Mount Fuji. I only wished I spent more time in the room. Room was scrupulously clean, and I'm a clean freak.Service - Faultless. Despite the sheer volume of guests, you feel like you're getting one-to-one service. Able to help with last minute dinner reservations, booking of airport limousines, even bringing up a weighing scale to our room when we asked for one.

The rooms we stayed in were small (bed, desk, small table and chair, and a padded window sill for sitting) as expected for a downtown area, but clean and sufficient for two people. The views were so spectacular, we found ourselves turning off the lights at night just to look out at the city. Three of the days we ate downstairs at the breakfast buffet and it was more than adequate with both European and Japanese choices.

Since I asked for this special arrangement from Park Hotel Tokyo, I have told them I have a little girl on this trip with the early arrival at 7:45, so that I asked for their kind hospitality to accommodate my request. Unfortunately it is likely the hotel guest services are set up with a ""robotic"" response which I assume their new Japanese ""hospitality technology"" as I kept receiving the same response from different names despite what I have tried to explain my needs. Even worse than ever I have seen in my traveling life, I requested the hotel a baby cot for my 23 months old, the first response they told the cot sizes that the hotel can accommodate and asked for my baby age, the second email another robot came in and said the cot is not able to accommodate my 23 months old, so that I should share the bed with her because they won't hold any responsibility for any problem could happen???

The location is fine - very close to Shimbashi railway station, and an easy underground connection to the Shiodome subway (no need to go outdoors). A short subway ride from Haneda, as well as a longer (but no changes required) subway ride to Narita. The rooms are on the small size (but that's to be expected in Japan). The furnishings were in good shape, the bed comfortable, the bathroom entirely adequate. $300 per night seemed excessive given that they then charged another 2800 yen for breakfast, and the buffet selection was modest (I have had better, for less, at several other Japanese hotels). I had wanted to get a breakfast-included rate, but none was available. Some guests seem to have been provided with breakfast vouchers but I don't know where they came from. The front desk staff is very nice and helpful, and their English is very good. Dining area staff at breakfast are OK (again, I've experienced better elsewhere).The odor problem that I experienced (same as reviewer Linzerbain) as far as I could tell came from the bathroom amenities provided. The brand name on all of them is ""Aromatherapy"", and they all have a scent similar to the sort of essential oils used in the practice of aroma therapy. In particular the scent seemed similar to ylang-ylang. Given that all the bath amenities are scented with this, it's not hard to imagine that over time the whole room has gotten permeated with the scent. I don't mind the scent when used occasionally, but having to breathe it continuously meant that after a while I felt somewhat queasy. Thereafter, as long as I was in the room, I felt unwell to queasy. By the third night, it was very unpleasant. Personally, I would book elsewhere. Last time I was in Tokyo I stayed at the Celestine, which was unfortunately full this time around, but I would rate that much higher than this hotel, despite Celestine's somewhat out-of-the-way location.","Minneapolis, Minnesota","FlamingoJohn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",42,2.0

The location and the price level was perfect for me and I did look forward to staying here....but....Ill start with the good points. Firstly, the location was really good. Right beside the Shiodome metro station, close by to Shimbashi railway station, with other metro lines. It was only an easy 5 minute walk to the Ginza area. From the hotel, by using the comprehensive metro system you could easily visit any part of Tokyo. Getting to the hotel from the airport could not have been more simpler, with the airport / hotel (Airport Limousine Bus Co.) bus system dropping us off right at the door. Check in was easy and welcoming. Our room was on the 32nd floor and as soon as you got in you could immediatley smell a musty odour, almost a slightly sour body odour. I put this down to dampness as the weather was particularly humid. A de-oderizing spray left in the room helped and we thought that it would go away (more later).The room size itself was slightly smaller than expected though OK for the 3 days we were here. We had a Tokyo Tower view room and it was simply amazing at night. All amenities were available and the room itself, although slightly tired was clean and comfortable. As we were jet lagged and went straight to bed after dinner we woke to find the room still had the musty smell. After breakfast we complained and told that it would be sorted out by the time we came back. A full day in Tokyo beckoned.Breakfast itself was not cheap but was well prepared and plenty of it. The selection was a bit on the small side with both Japanese and Western styles catered for.Coming back to our room late at night we still noticed the body odour smell (night No2 of our stay. Another spray of the room helped alleviate the problem, but left a sour taste in our mouths (if you pardon the pun).Another plus point.... we asked the concierge to book us a table for a restaurant we wanted to visit and they sent us an e mail to confirm our reservation while we were out at the Sumo Wrestling. Great service Park Hotel !! Day 3 and the problem with the smell in our room still had not been resolved. Although not a ""show stopper"", this put a real negative aspect to our stay here.Wi-fi was good and the staff very helpful in making sure we got the right bus to our next destination. If it wasn't for the smell in our room I would have given this hotel 5 stars.Travel tip - buy a Suica card and use it for contactless payments on the transportation system. Just top it up as you need. It will save you buying a ticket for every trip.","Falkirk, United Kingdom","linzerbairn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Falkirk, United Kingdom</strong>",102,3.0

The reason why I chose this hotel is because of the location and the artistic come-on. First, location is just 20 mins from Haneda Airport. You can take the train from Haneda airport to Shimbashi via the Keikyo Airport Line. It costs around 570 JPY. Then you can walk to the hotel within 10 mins. You can also take the monorail from Haneda and alight at Hamamatsucho Station then take a taxi to the hotel. It will cost around 1400 JPY in total. On a daily basis, the train station is just 7 mins away by foot. Its very easy access to Yamamoto line. Around the hotel premises are shops and restaurants, family mart and plenty of spaces to lounge around i open air. The hotel is not easily visible so if you take a cab, you have to look well on the street as the hotel is actually in a building up on the 25th floor inside an office building. 2nd, for the rooms, I loved the fact that the rooms are design with wall art, Not all rooms but the art rooms are really a feast. Although we didn't get the room that we really like, the paintings on the wall offer a difference in the usual hotel stays. Staying in these privileged rooms allow one to have breakfast and refreshments in the lounge for free. IN the lobby, there are several art pieces on exhibit and for sale as well. Its truly a feast for the eyes. The Tokyo tower is just out there when you look through the window. On a lucky clear day, you ma even be able to spot the Mt Fuji just through the panes behind the reception.

Also, pretty close to the fish market or Ginza.

The view of Tokyo tower is amazing but found the location to be a bit too quiet. We'd stayed in Shibuya and Shinjuku before and both these areas are much more exciting if that's what you want. The Shiodome station is below the hotel and you can get a train easily over to Odaiba (this was very busy). This line is not covered by a JR pass though and you need to walk to Shimbashi station to use the Yamamote line. This isn't far and is still convenient.The hotel does have an art theme and there's interesting work around. The room itself was a bit tired; the bathroom was basic and not like others we had during our trip. Complementary bottled water was not provided and we'd got used to that in other hotels we paid much less for. Coffee was not always replenished in rooms either. We were a bit disappointed as we'd paid much more to stay here than he had in our other hotels and we didn't get the 'wow' factor other than the view. We thought breakfast was pricey so we opted to use the Family Mart in the basement of the hotel. The NewsArt Cafe was closed the whole time we were there. The hotel is within media buildings and we saw lots of filming going on. The Studio Ghibli clock was also good to see. Overall it was an ok sort of stay.

In both stations, you can also take the Yurikamone line to Odaiba Island.I liked the location because is very well communicated (only 2 stops from Tokyo station if yo come by train, and 1 stop away from the Monorail to Haneda Airport).Additionally, it's quiet because it's in the heart of the financial district, but only a 10-15 minute walk to Ginza, a very popular neighbourhood.The rooms are quute big compared to Japanese standards.The only thing I would improve is breakfast. It's quite expensive (2.800Y/person/day) and it hasn't a ""wow effect"". It's first quality food, but the variety is scarce.Conveniently, you have some cafeterias and supermarkets nearby, so it's easy to have a breakfast. But I was surprised by the price. We tried it the last day just to see, thinking that it should be amazing since the price, and we were quite dissapointed.

Views from all rooms are fantastic as can be imagined.We'd arrived very early for our check in and rooms were not ready but we were made very welcome and we were able to find a couple of things to do locally until lunchtime when our rooms were free. Rooms themselves are quite small by European standards but nicely decorated and very clean. In common with other places we visited there is not a lot of closet hanging space or drawers. Perhaps , Japanese torists prefer to live out of suitcases on holiday? The staff were really excellent. Pleasant, well informed and polite of course but also not too formal. It made for a very relaxing stay. The breakfast buffet was the best of all of our Japanese hotels. The concierge was also very good, organising a private tour by metro for us on the first day (something I'd recommend as a good way to gain some orientation on the metro) and advice throughout. The hotel is also connected via an underground labyrinth to 2 subway stations (Shiodome, Shimbashi) so it's easy to get pretty much anywhere direct from the hotel.

Its logo of three skinny coloured flags helps you find the right one. It is a four star establishment, an easy walk from Shinbashi Station, in the south-east area of the city. A difficulty for tourists in much of central Tokyo, including this site, is that they use multiple levels for walkways, shops, restaurants, etc, and what you need might be three floors up or down six flights of escalators. The Park Hotel is no exception, and it was three days before we were reasonably confident of finding one of the front doors after an outing.The actual Reception and dining room are on the 25th floor and the guest bedrooms above that. We had no idea what went on in floors 1 - 24 or the various levels of basement. However, the place is clean (after all, this is Japan) and bright, with bedrooms and bathrooms of a pretty good size for this country. The bed was comfortable, and everything worked well in the rooms. However, as first time visitors to Japan we were taken by surprise by the heated loo seats and hygienic washing mechanism. Supplies of toiletries, hot drink ingredients (including good filter coffee), and useful items like toothbrushes razors and hairbrushes, slippers and kimonos were excellent, although they had no soap, only washing gel.The staff were all efficient and very friendly, but we found the constant Japanese bowing a bit disconcerting until we got used to it.

Our upgrade was a corner twin room and well worth the extra cost if I hadn't received it as a free upgrade. The view was spectacular to say the least. The bathroom had all the amenities we needed; the room was comfortable with enough room for our luggage. I loved everything about it. They helped us with having our luggage transported to our hotel in Kyoto. They did all the paper work and had it ready when we brought our luggage.

Rooms are cozy and bed was a little firm, but the rooms and hotel are clean, well kept, and comfortable. We did the a la carte breakfast, instead of the buffet, as I felt that it was a bit expensive for the offering at 2400 yen. 2 pieces of toast and 2 eggs cost about 1600 yen, but it did the job.

They give you to option of paying in JY or USD. For me paying in JY provided a better exchange rate. My only complaint was the limited number of outlets for all of our electronic devices.The views from the hotel lobby and our rooms was fantastic. Great view of Tokyo Tower every day. Even got to see Mt. Fuji one morning. We were on the 28th floor, but I suspect every room in hotel has great city views. The location of the hotel was great for exploring Tokyo. Located above the Shiodome subway station and a 15 minute walk to the Shimbashi station (via the underground mall, on B2 or elevated walkway on the 3rd floor). Being so close to transit was a welcomed relief at the end of a long day of sightseeing. The hotel lobby is just an elevator ride from the subway and a 15 minute walk from Shimbashi via a well lit mall that was still active late at night (so you felt safe). Ginza and the Tsukiji Fish Market are also a 15-20 minute walk from the hotel. We did not eat at the daily breakfast buffett. We hit the Family Mart (multiple locations in the underground mall below the hotel) and stocked up on snacks to eat while sightseeing before a sit down meal for lunch. There are multiple restaurants (20+) in the mall with different price points. On our last day we ate at Marugame Seimen in the Caretta building after checking out of the hotel. They serve tempura and udon cafeteria style and cater mostly to business people. Fortunately, they have an English menu - just ask. . Service is fast. Starbucks, McDonalds. and 711 stores are common in the Caretta building.Narita Airport Limo Bus will pick you up from the hotel and take you to the airport from the first floor of the Shiodome Media Tower (name of building hotel is located in). Beats the hassle of hauling luggage thru subway/train stations. A little more expensive per person but worth it. The hotel staff can make reservations for you. The staff will deliver your luggage to the bus. ","Los Angeles, California","eghr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",15,5.0

Great 4* hotel, I would definitely stay again and recommend to others.Positives:- Did I mention the view? The hotel lobby starts on the 25th floor, so all rooms would be guaranteed some kind of view. We paid extra for a corner room (Sky Tower view), on the 29th floor and were not disappointed! Almost floor to ceiling, panoramic views looking towards Mount Fuji, from the bed! Incredible.- Comfortable and fairly spacious room, with huge bed. - Good bathroom, toiletries etc.- Very quiet, we slept very well every night.- Despite arriving early, we were able to check-in at 10:00, some 5 hours before official check-in (which was handy due to some serious jet-lag).- Location, fairly quiet, commercial type of area with lots of nearby offices, but very handy for public transport, being right on 2 subway and 1 railway lines. If you don't mind a bit of a walk, you can easily wander up the main '5th Avenue' style shopping streets which we did several times - on your way to 'Tokyo' main station. Also you are very near to the fish market - a must when visiting Tokyo.- The staff were great and couldn't do enough for us, with plenty of available advice on how to get to places.- Prices around the hotel (e.g. the minibar) were fairly sensible.- There is a convenience store in the basement of the building where you can stock up on snacks, if required.Negatives (TBH, not many):- The communal areas of the hotel were fairly small, with not much choice of dining options.- The restaurant closed fairly early (by UK standards, anyway). On a particular Saturday night, after 21:30 there was only room service food available to eat in the bar. On the night when we did get to the restaurant early, the service felt very rushed as they hurried to clear everyone out. - Being that the area was very commercial, at the weekend, it felt very quiet and again, nearby restaurants were closed early.Summary:As long as you are not expecting a 5* hotel (although this came very close, in my opinion) and are not scared of heights - then this could be the ideal resting place for you! Just plan your day to make sure that you either eat out or have plenty of time left in the evening to have your evening meal at the hotel. Getting to all the attractions that Tokyo has to offer was easy by using the nearby subway and train links. Tips:- A taxi from Haneda airport came in at around $45US, although it would have been possible to take the monorail to a nearby station, with just a single change and then short walk.- Getting to Narita airport was achieved by using the Narita Express (included on your JR Pass, btw), to Tokyo station then a quick change and a few local stops to get to the hotel. As it's much further out, I think a taxi to Narita would be expensive.","Leighton Buzzard, United Kingdom","glencdawson</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leighton Buzzard, United Kingdom</strong>",85,4.0

It's a nice hotel but caters more to foreign travelers than local Japanese tourists. They serve a morning breakfast which we didn't sign up for the package. The place touts itself as part museum so you see lots of art pieces in the lobby which is nice but has a sterile feel where you don't quite feel comfortable like in a museum. The staff is polite but feels guarded. The strange thing is that 2 days into our stay, they asked for partial payment on the rooms because we were ""staying a long time"". Most hotels settle the bill at the conclusion of the stay. So either they have fiscal problems or have gotten stiffed on the bill in the past. There is a small laundromat on the 26th floor as well as a gym. Use of the gym requires booking an appointment. From our room we had a great view of the city and Tokyo Tower and one clear day we're lucky to see Mt. Fuji in the distance. The hotel has access to small Japanese restaurants in the basement which were frequented by business folks. It is walking distance to a mall with Starbucks, Japanese restaurants and the metro. There are a couple of nearby Family Marts to pick up food, Japanese snacks and water. We were able to purchase tickets from the hotel for the bus to pick us up from the hotel lobby and take us to the airport for our flight home, recommend you book 2 days ahead to guarantee a seat. The rooms are clean and they give you complimentary drip coffee, tea and a large bottle of water. I would stay at the hotel due to location near the metro and JR lines which we took daily but didn't really like the stiff feel of the lobby and the strange policy of paying for part of your room bill halfway thru your stay.

The property is close to the Ginza area, and about a 2 minute walk from the Shiodome Station on the Yurikamome Line or the Shimbashi Station with access from a number of major train lines including the Yamamote, Tokyo Metro Ginza, Tokaido and Asakusa (Airport Limited Express) lines.The hotel was reasonably priced for the Minato/Ginza area, with reasonably good sized rooms and a great view of the city and Tokyo Tower if you get a room on that side of the building. The lobby is on the 25th floor, with the rooms above. You won't have to go to Tokyo Tower's lower observation deck if you stay here. Our room on the 33rd out of 35 floors was at about the same level as the tower's first observation deck. This is a medium-to-higher-end property that is clean and well cared for. The buffet breakfast was quite good. I would rate it 7-8 out of 10 compared to other hotels that I have stayed at in Asia, with a number of quality items to choose from. The only thing lacking was some of the made-to-order options often available at some properties, and the variety was at the lower end for higher-end hotels. But still quite good. The hotel staff was terrific and very helpful.I would highly recommend the hotel for those looking for a quality property at a reasonable price (for Tokyo!). While this is more of a 3.5-4-star hotel rather than 5-star property, I give it a 5-star rating due to the reasonable cost, location cleanliness (even by Japan standards) and above average quality rooms.","Salt Lake City, Utah","David P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>",67,5.0

It's also close to the Shimbashi station for both Japan Rail and subway lines. It's walking distance to both the famous Tsukiji fish market (until they move) and an Edo-period public garden. The Ginza is about a 15 minute walk. There's an excellent breakfast buffet. The French restaurant is popular so advance reservations are necessary (we tried to get one a day in advance but were unsuccessful). There's also a cafe in the building lobby that serves western food; we had a quite acceptable late lunch of clam chowder, small salad and quiche. The hotel lobby on the 25th floor also has a lounge where you can get lunch or dinner. We ate there; they were out of a couple different entrees but the salmon we had was tasty.The hotel is popular with tour groups, so breakfast a peak time is a bit of a scrum.From the lobby early in the a.m. it may be possible to see Mt.

In another lapse, the scrambled eggs on the breakfast buffet were significantly underdone two days in a row. Intelligent people can argue about the correct doneness of scrambled eggs.

Important to mention is the size of the windows: they're huge! my favorite thing to do was to sit on the window side (it's cushioned) and enjoy my early morning coffee. - The artist rooms are really amazing, you can spend a long time staring at the walls without feeling like an idiot :) They also let you choose among the available rooms so you can get the room of your choosing!- The staff is very helpful and very kind. We arrived at 9am (the check-in is from 2pm) but they gave us one of the rooms immediately because it was available and they sped up the cleaning of the second one so they can enable us to rest as early as possible - I really appreciated that after a 14h flight. - If you are staying in an artist room you will have a complimentary breakfast in a small room on the 31st floor - again with an amazing view on Tokyo Bay. A very nice touch which we didn't expect at all. All-in-all I would very highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for something different and new with an amazing view.

So we grabbed some pastries from the bakery next door and went back to our room for coffee.

We've never stayed anywhere else.The regular rooms are slightly bigger than what you'd expect for a Japan hotel room. Amenities are complete, beds are comfortable, housekeeping is also great! Since hotel starts on the 25th floor, the views from the room are always very good (the rooms facing Tokyo Tower cost a bit more). Oh, and the wifi signal is consistent and strong.Staff service is always above par. English is widely spoken by Reception, Concierge and Bell Service so arrangements can easily be made with them. On our last day in Tokyo last 04March 2017, our flight was very late at night and our Airport Limousine Bus was at 9:25pm. Since check-out is standard at 12noon, we had our bags stored at Bell Service. At 9pm, we claimed our bags, intending to go down to the first floor entrance to wait for the bus. Bell Service told us to stay comfortable at the Lobby and at 9:15pm, he accompanied us with our bags to the first floor entrance, waited with us for the bus to arrive and saw us off. That's service!Breakfast is not fantastic, tho (for us at least) but there's a Family Mart in the Basement. The area is quiet at night, away from the bustle of places like Shibuya and Shinjuku, but getting around is not a problem. The Oedo Line's Shiodome subway station is right under the hotel. The Yurikamome line has a station just outside the 3rd floor walkway. Shimbashi Station is 8-10 leisurely minutes away, via the Yukikamome Line walkway, if you want to catch the JR Yamanote. And Ginza is a very short walk from the hotel! Location, location, location!And the view from the Lobby's wide windows? Tokyo Tower lit up at night is always beautiful; the lighting changes every couple of days so it's always a treat to see it. And on the morning of 03March, Mount Fuji could be seen crisp and clear beyond the Tokyo Tower.I recommend making your booking directly with the hotel on their website, where they offer promos. It's always easier if you need to make changes to your arrangement when you deal directly with the hotel; rather than booking thru one of the online hotel booking sites.I always tell my friends about Park Hotel Tokyo. It may be bit pricey for someone on a budget but, let me tell you, it is all worth it!Do I want to try another hotel?

Located within a stone's throw of the JR loop line's Shimbashi Stn and practically right on top of the Oedo subway Stn which also loops through the city, this palace is very convenient. Most of my business over the years was in Shinjuku so I frequented the Hilton, Hyatt and Keio hotels. Now my business is in the Toranomon/Roppongi area. I last stayed at the Okura. Lovely old hotel which brought back many memories, one of my old boss and professor who took me and my girl friend to lunch there in the 80's. First time I had gazpacho. The Okura is great, big rooms, great staff, great restaurants and literally a 5 minute walk from my company's Tokyo office. It's pricey and after decades of visiting and living in Japan, I wanted to branch out. What caught my attention about the Park Hotel is its art rooms. Why stay in a regular hotel when you can get uniquely designed and painted rooms done by individual artists? The room size is a little narrower than ""western"" standards but ample by Japanese standards. I live in a McMansion at home and have no problem with the Park Hotel's room size. Great view of Shimbashi Stn and the Shinkansen. A central atrium gives a sense of expanse and openness. It's distinctively decorated from the lobby on the 25th floor on up. I love it here. Even though it's a 25 minute walk from my office, I prefer this to the Okura and plan to make it my go-to hotel from now on. The only other hotel in the city that interests me like this is the Park Hyatt in Shinjuku which is 2-3 times the price without the individual art.","Reno, Nevada","LamplighterScott</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Reno, Nevada</strong>",21,5.0

Ok, as I am at the hotel for sleeping purposes, it does not play that important role. But as the first view of the day there are nicer alternatives. One should also mention that around 5 am the trains start there daily operation (which stops again round midnight). So from that moment on you will hear the trains getting in and out the station, or the Shinkansen passing by. It is not so loud so that you wouldn't be able to sleep any more (windows are well protecting from noise). But when stay awake due to jet lag, you will notice that. However, it did not disturb too much.Again I would like to spend some words on the breakfast. This is getting more and more annyoing. Every year and every morning the same things to eat. Costing 2.400 Yen one would expect more variations. One sort of cheese and sausage, the same every day. And still this old toaster which needs 5 minutes or more to bring some brown colour on the bread. Why can't they invest in a newer, more powerful one? And one toaster only! That might take 15 minuets before you have your bread toasted. Another point: although at least 5 waiters run around, they never notice you when you want to have new coffee. Maybe I should dance on the table next time.My recommendation: if breakfast is important for you, go to the Royal Park Shiodome which is just on the other side of the street. Or have breakfast outside. But apart from that, the hotel is still worth a high recommendation.","Gladbeck, Germany","372frankk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gladbeck, Germany</strong>",5,4.0

There was always somebody to help us with reservations or finding a location.Our room was compact but worked well and was quiet, just like we wanted. The pillows took a little getting used to compared to our North American style.The breakfast was not included but factoring it in made it the same price as the Royal Park. It was really good. There was a good assortment of fruit and juices. There were scrambled eggs and bacon or sausages with some veggies. One morning we asked for fried eggs and they provided them to perfection. There a small but nice selection of pastries as well.

As my wife was not well, I left a series of instructions to the front desk/concierge staff who diligently followed through with them all. The same staff also had a strong knowledge of all surrounding amenities outside the hotel and named me a few pharmacies located nearby by drawing them out on a map.

Every time in Tokyo we always got headaches using the train system. So this time we elected to pick a hotel that was serviced by the Limousine bus directly to/from the airport. The hotel is located in a quiet business district. Not much directly around the hotel but if you walk a few blocks you will be in Ginza. The hotel is suited for business travelers. We noticed every guest in the hotel was there for business. During breakfast we were the only ones eating not in business suits taking about electronic brands. The fish market is walking distance from this hotel. However lacking in sense of direction we took ubers everywhere. Uber to Fish Market, Tokyo Tower, Ginza was roughly $10USD each trip each way. The lobby has a breathtaking view of entire Tokyo. We originally had a standard room but the lobby view sold us to upgrade our room to the tower view. It was an extra $15 a night and well worth it. The rooms are standard Asian size small . Which I am not sure why people complain in other reviews. That is the standard in all of Asia, it must be their first time here. Small but efficient and very modern, all toiletries included so leave your razor at home. Also has the standard Japanese modern butt warmer, sprayer toilet. Breakfast is 25$ USD per person every morning . You can pay at check in or just bill it to your room . The breakfast selection was tiny and highly over priced. I understand $25 for breakfast if the buffet is extensive. However there was a little of fresh fruit, breads, and some eggs, salad, and soup. Since the hotel doesn't have many close restaurants nearby we just sucked it up and ate at the hotel. There is a pastry/coffee shop on the first floor of the building. So if you are a light breakfast eater that can be an option. Another perk was we were able to book our limo bus tickets back to the airport with the hotel concierge. (Super Convenient) This hotel truly has some of the sweetest people who work there. Everyone was so helpful and attentive.

Don't confuse it with the nearby Royal Park Hotel which is slightly more upscale with at least one star more of facilities. Many hotels design their shop front to be their best feature and this is no different. The lobby and (presumably) the artists rooms look great. But the hotel is flawed despite it's great views starting at the 25th floor of the media tower. It really is a budget hotel dressed up.We found:- the rooms to be small (even for Tokyo) - although not uncomfortably small.- the bathrooms to be at least one or two grades below the room. The towels were mini sized.- the pillows were lumpy and crackled a bit when you moved which was off-putting to say the least.- the noise in one room (we had 3) to be intolerable. Surprisingly the noise from the train station directly below came straight into one room making it VERY NOISY. So much so that the occupants of that room had to use headphones to get to sleep! Of the 3 rooms only the room facing the train station directly suffered.- check in was slow (not helped by the fact that the booking was messed up by them)- the rooms to be overpriced by comparison with other similar hotels (and that is without staying in the artist rooms)The two best features of this hotel are the views and the location.

I chose this hotel for its proximity to Tokyo Station (where we arrived from Kyoto) and for the Airport Limo bus to Narita. But other aspects of the hotel surprised us and exceeded our expectations.It was a bit tricky finding the correct exit from Shimbashi station, in spite of the hotel's detailed directions on its website, but once we did, we reached the hotel quickly and easily. The walkway there amid the skyscrapers with the gardens and unusual clock was quite interesting. Then you take the elevator to the hotel's amazing lobby--be sure to wander around and investigate the art displayed around the lobby and lounge (much of it is for sale!). Like many Japanese hotel rooms, our rooms were compact but well-organized twin rooms, with incredible city views overlooking the Tokyo Tower and Mount Fuji! We could also watch commuter and bullet trains on the tracks far below. All the usual amenities (although we only discovered the robes in a drawer the next morning). We made reservations for dinner in the hotel's French bistro restaurant, which was stellar. One of the best meals during our two weeks in Japan. Highly recommend the venison and Wagyu beef. Slight mixup over breakfast. I didn't think breakfast was included in our room rate, yet we were given three vouchers for breakfast, so I thought perhaps breakfast was included after all. Two of us had breakfast. When we checked out, we were charged for three breakfasts. Don't know why we received vouchers if we had to pay for breakfast, or why we were charged for my son, who didn't have breakfast. We were short on time at checkout so I opted not to pursue it. But if you unexpectedly receive vouchers, do ask how they work. The breakfast buffet was very good, by the way.The staff took our bags down to the airport bus for us and made sure we and the bags got on the bus. Easy ride (past Disney Tokyo) to Narita.

The location is outstanding as you have easy access to the Toei Oedo subway as well as JR Shinbashi station being within a 10 minute walk through the underground passageway. We visit Tokyo regularly and were surprised by the convenience of staying in Shiodome. You can walk to Ginza in 15 minutes, get to Tokyo station within a couple of stops for any Shinkansen or express train connections and easily access anywhere in Tokyo by train. There are lots of small cafes and restaurants nearby if needed, including an Excelsior Cafe in the Pedi building which serves good espresso/cappuccino as part of their morning breakfast set.

When you arrive you take a lift up to the lobby on a much higher floor. The lobby itself is very impressive and well decorated with excellent views of Tokyo. Before reading the rest - this hotel is pretty expensive and when I pay more I expect more in terms of service etc. As such, I felt let down by the Park Hotel Toyko several times throughout our trip. Check-in: We arrived fairly late (9:30pm) due to flight delays and the check-in process took quite a long time, however this was ok as we were amazed at the views behind the reception desk. We asked if there was anywhere we could get any food but were told no as the restaurants were now closed. There was no mention of the bar still being open and serving food, room service or suggestion of any of the nearby restaurants (in the basement and just outside the hotel. We were left to discover this ourselves on a quest for dinner. Rooms; Large with absolutely incredible views of the Kyoto Tower/Tokyo/Mount Fuji. Our room did smell a little bit musty. The bathroom was fine - a bit dated. We had one normal pillow and one beanbag style pillow which was very strange. Free wifi was good. Breakfast: There was a large buffet with a lot of choice of both western and Japanese food although a number of hot dishes were luke warm at best (and we came at different times on all 3 days). Getting attention to have more than one hot drink was quite difficultBar food: We ate here the first night and the food is expensive (standard bar food all £20-£30) but is very tasty. Service was excellent. Japanese restaurant: The food in this restaurant was very good but it is incredibly expensive and the a la carte menu portions are tiny. We left still hungry. Check-out - We had previously advised the hotel that we were four people with four large suitcases and we needed to go to the train station and asked if we needed to book a taxi and told no. On the morning, we were told no big taxis would be available for over an hour so we would need to take two taxis. The doorman who then helped with our bags then told the taxi driver to take us to the airport. Luckily we confirmed and corrected this. I don't know if this was a language barrier but this process was frustrating and left us annoyed at the hotel when leaving. Location: We thought this was a good location to explore Tokyo, however as mentioned above it would have been helpful for the hotel to provide maps/more details about the local area/restaurants to help guests.Overall this hotel could be excellent but we were left a bit disappointed.","Edwalton, United Kingdom","Samsiebabes</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edwalton, United Kingdom</strong>",102,3.0

The bathroom has all the amenities I needed for a brief stay in Tokyo. Although my room was pretty cramped, it has a spectacular view of Tokyo, the Tokyo Tower, and Mt Fuji. The only thing I'd suggest for management to consider is to have a directional sign on the first floor big enough for a tired and weary traveler could see immediately. It took me a while to figure out where to go when I entered Shiodome Media Tower. It was 11 pm and the ground floor lobby was poorly lit.

There is a ""limo bus"" from Narita to the hotel that offers convenient and fairly quick access even with a few stops at major hotels along the way. But with baggage, much easier than trying a local train and subways, which would also be an option, because this hotel has quick access via connected tunnels to the subways and Shimbashi JR Train Station. This was a huge plus. I never had to fight traffic or crowds, other than those in the tunnels and on the subways. Needless to say, I could get anywhere in Tokyo after a short walk thru tunnels to the subway station. The hotel is simply beautiful. The lobby is located on the 19th floor and the rooms are on floors above that - I think up to floor 33. I had a deluxe room on the 25th floor with a stunning view of Tokyo Tower. Photo ops right out of my room window. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed exceedingly comfortable. The room was furnighed in modern and tasteful furniture and the bed was exceedingly comfortable. The bathroom was large and equipped with a combo shower/tub. I was fully expecting cramped quarters based on everything I heard about hotels in downtown Tokyo. Again, I had a deluxe room, so I imagine it was larger than standard rooms. The hotel had a great lounge on the lobby 19th floor and in addition to a well stocked bar (some very good Sake's BTW) offered great views of the city. There were also two very good restaurants on this floor and I had dinner in both of them. One was traditional Japanese fare and the other French cuisine. Both were excellent, although very pricey. Like all Japanese hotels, the staff were friendly and made me feel like an honored guest. In addition to normal concierge services, and they were extensive, they also offered baggage transfer services so I could avoid lugging baggage thru the tunnels and onto a train when traveling to my next destination. Although I was on vacation, this hotel would be perfect for a business traveler as well.","Kansas City, Missouri","Gary G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City, Missouri</strong>",45,5.0

The hotel starts at around the 25th floor of its building, and goes up from there.We got one of their rooms with a view of the Tokyo Tower, and the view was absolutely sensational. At night, the tower is lit up beautifully, and it's really nice to just sit there and admire the view. On one particularly clear morning, we could see Mt.

One thing I recommend is that they use the Mt Fuji tour guide I had which is Japan Panoramic Tours, so next time I stay, I don't have to go to another hotel for pick up. I highly recommend them after a spectacular journey to Mt Fuji. I look forward as a Travel professional to recommending this hotel to everyone who visits Tokyo and returning and making this my own permanent choice to stay each visit. The only downside for me was when I was exhausted after my long day of touring Mt Fuji. I wanted to order from the restaurant menu and take my food to my room and that was not allowed but they were so kind to accommodate me with an item to be sent to my room.

The location is pretty good -- walkable to the fish market (which was one of our favorite stops in Tokyo) and to public transportation. But if you're looking for a hotel with plenty of restaurants/bars in immediate walking distance, you'll be disappointed. As for the hotel itself, I wouldn't call this a luxury hotel, more of a business hotel. It's definitely worth paying extra for a room with a view. We did, and the view is pretty stunning -- but it's about the only great thing we can say about this hotel. Everything else was just fine. The lobby and restaurant area were welcoming and modern, and the service was good, but the room itself was very ""budget,"" small, outdated and not particularly clean or well-appointed. Apparently there are some recently renovated rooms -- I can't imagine that ours was one of these, since ours seemed more like a somewhat dingy college student's apartment. All that said, since we were planning a very short stay in Tokyo and looking for something accessible enough to rail & the fish market, the Park Hotel was entirely sufficient.

If you take a taxi anywhere, beware that many will try to drop you off at the wrong hotel as there is a Royal Park hotel nearby and the drivers will get confused. The concierge at the Park Hotel will give you a flyer or a business card that you can give the taxi drivers to clarify where they need to take you when you're trying to get back to the hotel.

I would definitely recommend it if you want a nice city view. I found that Tokyo (at least in the Shiodome) had a lot of hotels that are the top floors of a building on top of a commercial building. In this case, the lobby of the Park Hotel Tokyo was on the 25th floor and all of the rooms were above that. So no matter what every room was at a high vantage point with great views of the city. The hotel is located in the Shiodome area of Tokyo which is a short walk from Ginza and Tsukiji Market (very useful if you're trying to go to the auction or Sushi Dai early in the morning). Also, the Shimbashi station is about a 10 min walk and provides access to just about everywhere else in Tokyo. There's also a lot of great restaurants around Shimbashi station.

Over the course of 6 nights, I got past the size of the room and appreciated both its cleanliness and the large window with a fantastic view of the city, facing Tokyo Tower. I also really appreciated the excellent staff, who spoke English well and went out of their way to be helpful, especially with transportation and the logistics of getting around Tokyo. The housekeeping staff kept the room very clean and well stocked with toiletries. The hotel is also well-situation, right above a train station and near shops, restaurants and small grocery stores. The food in the hotel is also good. I will likely be returning soon to Tokyo, again on business, and will consider staying at the Park Hotel again.My two suggestions to the staff: 1.) your lobby is on the 25th floor. Walking into a large business building is confusing and carrying a lot of luggage by oneself while trying to figure out where to go is difficult and inconvenient. Other hotels like the Conrad next door have staff at the entrance to welcome and direct guests, and assist with their luggage. It would be much appreciated if your hotel did this as well. 2.)

Now when we used the shuttle limo bus from the airport, we saw that at every hotel we stopped, staff would come out and greet the bus driver and then take the customers to the concierge and I guess assist them with check-in.With Park Hotel Tokyo, the bus driver took our bag down and we had to make our own way there. When we were at check-in the service staff were excellent of course as all Japanese culture is. We were asked if we wanted to upgrade for $xxxx (can't recall the exact price) a night however we said no thank you, we would like to use the money to enjoy ourselves in Japan. Just want to let the managers of this hotel know that both in Hong Kong and Beijing (which we were prior to our last stop in Tokyo), we were offered a upgrade for a fee and when we said no as we wanted to have fun outside the hotel, they said because it was our first time in their hotel, they upgraded us anyways for free. P.S the hotel (I AM CERTAIN) was not fully booked.After finally checking in, we got to our room. Looking at the artwork in the hotel lobby, we could only imagine how nice our room was. When we got in... it was a shock. The room was very very very small. Yes, I have stayed at several hotels in my life for both Business and Leisure and both in Australia and outside Australia, but this hotel was small.There was an artwork on the wall but that is about it! I would have much rather not put the very hi-tech toilet and spent (assuming) $5,000aud and perhaps made the room slightly more comfortable.Furthermore to find that I had to shower in a Bathtub where I had to use the shower curtains as a method to stop the water from going out.... I was willing to ask the concierge to find us another hotel room but wife convinced me not to.The hotel is known for it's artwork, having shower curtains is not very artistic.The beds are not very comfortable either. Unsure if this is Japanese technology or the secret of sleeping comfort however they were not.On a much brighter note - the hotel is situated perfectly within 2 minute walk to the train station and over 50 restaurants and bars including small grocery stores.The hotel staff are extremely friendly and a pleasure to deal with as are all people in Japan.The buffet breakfast we had was delicious however I would make a small note to management, I understand the location of the restaurant is quite tight, however it would have been good not to sit so very close to each other.In Summary:If you don't care about your hotel as you are planning to enjoy Tokyo outside the hotel, then definitely stay here as it's location is prime!If they change the bedding style and build proper shower that has a shower head and shower glass door, then I would stay in this hotel again, otherwise, if they gave me $200AUD discount each night, I still don't think I would stay here.","Sydney, Australia","Eddy D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",78,3.0

There was a beautiful temporary exhibition during our stay which included night time light projections on the atrium wall.

Although with rooms starting on (I think) floor 25, you can't really get a bad view. The room itself was more spacious than we anticipated and easily on par with standard London hotel rooms. We had space for 2 stupidly large suitcases open on the floor, walking room around the bed even with our things escaping the cases, a chair and table by the window and a clear path to the bathroom. The bathroom was great and I was amazed by the little steam free area on the mirror which is just at face height - what a touch! The service we encountered was top notch and I even got a half bottle of champagne as a birthday gift which set my birthday celebrations off with a bang. Everyone was so polite, helpful and calming in their manner. We returned to the hotel bar for some post-birthday-dinner drinks and met the most wonderful chatty bar manager who talked us through a world of whisky, even offering up some tasters from his very own collection. We tried his favourite which was a crazy super-burning batch made in total limited quantities. Very lucky!As amazing as the views are during the day, the city always comes alive at night and I could have sat on the windowsill seat for the rest of my days, watching the teeny tiny cars and trains below making their way to new towns. The bullet trains are so quiet as they pass and we could barely hear them through the toughened windows. Upon leaving, we chose to forward our baggage on to the next city and when I enquired as to how it would work when we arrived at the next hotel, the bell porter informed me she had already called ahead to confirm everything so we just needed to check in and the bags would be delivered to the room. A system so efficient I feel like it could never work anywhere else in the world, despite how convenient it would be.All in all an amazing stay for my 30th birthday and every bit what I had imagined.

My only ""suggestion"" is that I didn't really know how to get there from the Shimbashi train station -- the hotel's website wasn't very informative, and navigating it was a bit problematic technologically. (Also, when I confirmed the room, I couldn't get a clear PDF from the confirmation page -- it captured some of it but not all of it. I've never had this problem before or since, so I assume it has something to do with how their webpage is set up.) The price was a bit high for my usual standards -- but the place is great. The restaurant options were all way above anything I'd spend money on (e.g., $15 for a glass of wine), so I didn't try any of them. I'm attaching photos of the local map the hotel provided once I arrived - I wish I had this info before I arrived (but didn't find this info on their website).

The rooms are modern and clean, for Japanese standards even spacious (i.e. you have enough space to open a large suitcase on the floor). The best thing about the park hotel is the view: we hat a room facing the river and we could see airplanes taking off and landing on nearby Haneda Airport.

Check-in was smooth and pleasant, but our stay experience made a turn for the worse when we arrived at our room. Upon walking into the bathroom we immediately noticed some hairs stuck to the wall in a prominent area just by the door, which suggested that the room had probably not been inspected properly. The design of the room itself was fine, although on the small side, slightly dated and bland - think business hotel - despite the futuristic location in the Shiodome district. As some other reviewers have mentioned, the interior could definitely benefit from a refresh. Meanwhile, our poor experience with the hotel's service continued the next morning, when we called the front desk for help with our luggage and had to wait for quite a long time for the bellhop to show up, so we ended up having to call again. Of note, this was around 10AM, not exactly the peak checkout time for the hotel (which has a 12PM checkout policy). Finally, after checking out and coming back later in the day to collect our luggage, we found the bell desk empty and had to wait until someone showed up 5 minutes later. Unfortunately, nobody at the front desk nearby came to assist us.

When I saw the very limited options, and didn't like the eggs they served, I was told if I needed to get poached eggs, that would be an extra charge of 10 dollars. I had served myself only a miso soup and a bread roll, and ordered a capuccino. When I asked to be served a la carte, the capuccino and eggs were included and so was the single piece of bread that the head waiter was trying to figure out in the transaction. This is when we are paying 386 US dollars a night per room for the very tiny rooms, which we had to get 2 of because we couldn't possibly fit in one room with our 2 girls.In the end, I was told that the miso soup would be complimentary because it wasn't in the a la carte menu, but my 2 poached eggs, single bread and capuccino came out to 20 us dollars.

The rooms were reasonably sized for a capital city (although the children's double was a little tight) with good amenities in the bathroom. Some of the rooms have rather funky art -- including the one I stayed in -- which was fun. Other facilities included a communal washing-machine/dryer, a tiny gym (for one person/small group use at a time, bookable in 45min slots -- I never had any difficulty getting in whenever I wanted so suspect not used that much); and vending machines with ice on I think all floors. The Tokyo tower view rooms are above the railway tracks and while a little noisy during the day it wasn't a problem at night; but if you're very sensitive to noise worth bearing in mind.There is a large atrium where breakfast is served along with light evening meals and drinks, and a couple of restaurants and a bars off it. The bar makes good cocktails, priced at upmarket hotel levels. We ate in the French restaurant a couple of times (excellent food, very swiftly served -- they had a special multi-course set menu for guests which was good value). We were less impressed with the breakfast buffet -- all fine but not standout, worth buying as a package rather than pay-as-you go if you can and want a large breakfast).Service was, as might be expected, punctilious and very high quality. It's worth joining the loyalty scheme if staying there a few nights as they give some freebies.The hotel itself is located close to Shimbashi station (for JR trains and the metro) and there are plenty of local restaurants.

The closest rail station, Shimbashi, is a few minutes walk and it's only a five minute ride to Tokyo Station. The nearest metro, the Odeo Line, is basically right out the front door and connects to Roppongi, the popular nightlife district, and Shinjuku, a shopping, eating, and nightlife mecca. You really can't beat the location. For the price, this hotel is really great value. The rooms are well-appointed and clean, although a bit small (like most Tokyo hotel rooms). The staff is incredible. We booked several dinner reservations through the concierge, who emailed us when the reservations were made.To get to the Park Hotel, I would suggest taking a taxi from Tokyo station when you arrive. It's only about $10. Also, try to upgrade to a larger room if you can, since they are a bit small. We had a corner twin, which had an incredible view of the bay.

The location is excellent, right beside Shimbashi station so it's easy to get out and about, and lots of good eateries on the other side of the station (including good old Starbucks and Subway if you're struggling with Japanese food).The reason it doesn't get a five star rating is that even though we are up 32 floors, we can hear the trains passing by pretty loudly through the window. The bathroom shower is also angled quite horizontally, spraying the entire bathtub and onto the floor (luckily there's a drainage thing next to the bathtub, seems to have been designed this way) which cannot be changed.

The itinerary from JAL was first class and we got exactly what we had asked for which was detailed support at every transfer and full guidance in EnglishWe were quite nervous about a country with a very different culture, language and script but the reality is that Japan is trying hard to welcome tourists with English signage at train, bus stations and tourist hot spots, indeed it was obvious that additional signage had been added recently. On top of which the people are very welcoming, like to practise their English and respond well to sign language. That said we might not have ventured into some restaurants and local areas without the support of our guides who enabled us to experience the real Japan. Once in a restaurant they really want to help you and most have English and / or pictorial menusThe food was an adventure but there were plenty of Western options if wanted with the ubiquitous MacDonalds, Burger King, KFC and Starbucks in all the cities, plus generic Italian, Thai, Chinese and American restaurants. All our hotels had Western Breakfast options.Smoking was not an issue as it is banned on most city streets and the locals gather obediently to smoke at designated shelters. It is allowed in some small bars and eateries but nearly all bigger ones and those in the stations, where there was a huge choice, were non smoking. Similarly the trains have closed smoking rooms and most carriages are non smoking.The sights are a feast for the imagination with high tec modern buildings and ancient temples side by side. We took long journeys by bus and train but this enabled us to see some spectacular scenery and acres of paddy fields.As the journey progressed we got bolder and took ourselves by train to Osaka and Fushimi from Kyoto, plus twice in and out of Tokyo with just the help of a map. The Tourist Information Offices at many stations have them in English and most tourist spots have leaflets in several languages.All that you have to get your head round is that the stations can be huge with many platforms, department stores, shopping and restaurant malls. The trains run to time and carriages stop on exact markers for each car, staff at the ticket barriers are friendly and helpful.We felt very safe walking around and on all public transport, saw no evidence of crime on the streets and only a very few street sleepers in just a couple of areas although we didn't stay out late because of the time differenceOne of the highlights had to be the many gardens, we had missed the Cherry Blossom but the summer trees and flowers were glorious and, from the pictures that we saw, Autumn must be similarly stunning. I would highly recommend Japan, we would definitely go again and would be confident that we could find our own way around nowAll the hotels had good wifi and there were many free wifi areas in shopping malls as well as in StarbucksJapan isn't expensive if you avoid eating in the hotels and follow the locals who eat mainly in and around the stations and top floors of Department Stores before heading home. Entry fees are reasonable and many smaller temples and shrines are freeThe weather in May/early June was lovely, warm and dry apart from 2 wet days. It had been wet before we arrived and the rainy season starts mid-June however they are well set up for rain and umbrella storage.

Prices range from the US$200-300 depending on size of room. We upgraded to the larger 350 square feet suites. We didn't try the restaurant as it only looks average, but for a quality stay at a good pricepoint, you can hardly do better in Tokyo. Any example would be the next door Hilton Conrad Tokyo in the $400-500/night...Good luck and enjoy!","Vancouver, Canada","LHOVancouver</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",344,4.0

The hotel is in a business district which is apparently built not long ago so there are 3 levels of walking area, roads and again walking area. You can use underground walk areas to reach the hotel which is very complicated. I have tried to access train station from outside which was easy since you can see the hotel. Hotel starts at 25th level and I guess goes up to 34. I have paid a bit more and reserve a corner room with a great view. The view was excellent. Everything in the room work perfectly, very silent A/C, there is a best quality air purifier/humidifier, bad was very big and comfortable, room was good size. The bathroom was also excellent with every need you may have. The toilet had a heated seat with lots of features which is usual in Japan. I did not have breakfast in the hotel since it was 22$. There is several cafes (including 2 Starbucks) in a close walking distance. The staff in the reception was extremely helpful and always smiling. Room cost was 270 EUR but this is a normal price for this quality hotel in this location. There is a shuttle bus stopping here from Narita but if you arrive after 19:00 there is no shuttle bus anymore so you need to take train which is complicated.

We would have so liked to settle, have a refreshing shower and then go out. The situation was saved by my husband who agreed to stay in the reception, whilst the rest of us visited the antique market nearby. Perhaps this hotel needs to understand the needs of international travellers just a little more - the rooms were prepared but the 'check in is at 3.00pm' with no negotiation. The breakfast was ample with lots of choice, although you had to be determined to get a waiter to serve coffee.

The rooms were small but are not considered small byTokyo standards. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was so friendly, courteous, and kind. The hotel is spotlessly clean and well maintained. The hotel is located in the Shiodome Media Tower. The lobby/reception desk is located on floor 25. Our first room looked into the many skyscrapers located in the Shiodome complex. Our second room faced East with a view of the Sumida River, Tsukiji Market, and the Hama-Rikyu Gardens. The hotel provided everything needed while traveling, including, shower caps, Q-tips, hair bands, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, loofah washcloth, toothbrush/paste, shaver/shaving cream, hairbrush, drinking glasses, and a hairdryer. The small refrigerator could be used to keep your drinks/food cool. This hotel has a very relaxing lobby, shaped like an atrium, with ample seating, and a buffet restaurant offering breakfast, lunch, and dinner. This became important since our return flight was at 1 a.m. and we checked out of the hotel at noon. We were able to relax comfortably before leaving for the airport. We found the easiest way to exit/enter the hotel was on the 3rd floor by the pedestrian deck. To walk to Ginza you walk towards the Shimbashi station (in the direction of the clock), take exit 1C, a stairway leading down to the street, and then turn right. There is an excellent supermarket located underneath the highway/railway overpass on the right side of the street. Here are the hotel's instructions from the Shinbashi station/JR Line: • Take the Karasumori Exit and turn left out of the ticket gate.• Across from you, go UP the stairs under “Shimbashi Station” sign.• Follow the pedestrian deck until you see a small walkway on the right (this is between two large buildings).• Take the walkway between the buildings. You will see a large clock on the right side building.• Follow the walkway to the large building between the two large buildings, you will find the 3rd floor entrance to Shiodome Media Tower.• Walk through the door and continue along until the elevator of the Park Hotel Tokyo. The other hotel exits include level B1 where the Family Mart is located, offering the best selection of yogurts.The hotel entrance on this level has a small sign in English with the hotel name written over the door in Japanese. There is access to the train/metro station on Level B1 but we found this route very confusing. Level 1/ground floor, the main building lobby, where you are dropped off/picked up by the Limousine Bus. I am including this information since we were unable to determine our direction and spent a lot of time wandering around aimlessly. Also, the Shinbashi station is very large, with several metro/train lines, and its' very crowded. The buildings have no names on them (unless written in Japanese). The TV offered 2 channels in English; CNN and an second channel which showed evening movies. Areas of interest nearby, include, the Panasonic Showroom and the Caretta, a shopping and dining complex, There is an another area if you turn right from the JR Line/Shimbashi station via the Karasumori Exit. I believe this is an older area of Shinbashi with clubs, restaurants, and convenience stores. We found this area rather seedy, but at night, it looked like the set of Blade Runner. This hotel is centrally located; 1 metro stop from Ginza, and 2 train stops from the Tokyo station. The only negative point is the difficulty in reaching the hotel due to the multiple levels and entrances. We landed at the Haneda Airport, took the Hamamatsucho monorail, then the Daimon metro 1 stop to the Shiodome station. This decision was a mistake since it was late at night, after a 14 hour flight, and the stations reguire walking down/up multiple staircases while carrying luggage. Suggestions for the hotel: 1) place a larger sign in English by the B1 hotel entrance 2) add to your Shiodome map the shapes of the buildings if distinguishable. 3) offer the NHK news channel on TV in English. Lastly, upon check out, a very nice young woman inquired about our travel arrangements to the airport. She made reservations for the last Limousine Bus to Haneda Airport, gave us directions, and held our luggage. I love traveling to Japan, mainly, because the people are so courteous, kind, and helpful; the service you receive in Japan is exceptional and unmatched anywhere in the world. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Park Hotel and look forward to staying there again.","Los Angeles, California","Carolynrose</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",70,5.0

Painters from throughout Japan have been commissioned to create a tableau in each room. It's a wonderful, creative idea. We wrote about it at whereiscookie, and can't say enough about the hotel's unique encouragement of local and regional artists. You can sleep with the fishes, dream with the stars, go back in Japanese history to shogun days, or take a fairy tale ride into Japanese myth. We stayed five nights, and wish it had been ten. Video images of the artwork are projected on the beautiful walls. The hotel hosts receptions and revolving art shows! Rooms look out over Tokyo's bustling streets and soothing parks. And you are staying a few days in a ""painting"" -- breathtaking. The breakfast, included in the room, is splendid, too, a wonderful blend of east-meets-west. You can have beautiful miso soup, pickles and veggies, smoked salmon or bacon and eggs with gorgeous fruit and healthy cereals, juices and breads. An elegant restaurant offers beautifully presented meals. The bar is welcoming and our bartender was Italian, perfect for an international gathering place.

A rare slip-up in Japanese efficiency.The hotel reception area is on the 25th floor of the Shiodome Media Tower which is fine and dandy except that the number of lifts is inadequate and they are quite slow. Once on the 25th, another lift needs to be caught to your room floor after a walk from one side of the floor to the other. Just makes for a slightly long winded access.The hotel building is a triangular prism shape, and given the central atrium space and height, rooms on any side have spectacular views.The nearby Shiodome and Shimbashi stations can be reached by a maze of underground walkways. The hotel does provide a walking map to help overcome initial confusion, but we found wandering around and following (sometimes) contradictory signage was the best guide. Luckily this is a new complex and all signs have English as well as Japanese information.Once outside the towers and stations, it was a 10 minute walk to the Tsukiji fish market and nearby gardens. This is a far better option than taking the train for just a stop or two, especially during the commuter rush hours.

I was lucky enough to get one on the 29th floor overlooking the Tokyo Skytree, and when I entered into my room for the first time at dusk, it afforded one of the most picturesque views i've ever seen from a hotel room. The Location:Situated in the Shiodome Media Tower, within the Shiodome prefecture, the hotel is quite a perfect location for roaming the heart of the city.

The building and the ones surrounding it are very modern and not as busy as other parts of Tokyo. This worked great for me as I don't like crowds but could still get anywhere I wanted to go because there are multiple Metro/Subway lines nearby, easily taking us anywhere we wanted to go. If you are flying into Haneda, you can get to this hotel without having to make any changes on the train.Check-in was easy and very friendly. As with most places in Japan, the service is quick, efficient, and extremely polite. The staff at the Park Hotel speak English well and communication was not a problem. I noticed a lot of American tour groups going in and out of the hotel so no worries here if you fear a language barrier. I upgraded to a corner twin room for about $20 USD a night and it had a side view of the Tokyo Tower. The rooms are all on high floors and I enjoyed the views and it was a great place to relax and soak in the city. It was so relaxing that we ordered room service one night versus going out. It was pricey but pretty good!The rooms are very simple and have everything you need. The corner twin was big enough for two people and the beds were comfortable enough. The selection of toiletries in the bathroom was impressive and there was doubles of everything. Things were replaced by the attentive housekeeping staff. And when you are in Japan....there's the toilets...the wonderful, amazing toilets! I wish I could have taken it home with me. If you've never been to Japan and experienced a Japanese style toilet, it will be a real treat.You are able to get a late check out for about $15 USD an hour (through 3 or 4pm). This came in handy as our flight didn't leave for LA until after midnight. One tip that the person who brought up my luggage gave us was invaluable. There is a Family Mart 24-hour convenience store on the B2 level of the building. We made several trips there during our stay. They have just about anything you need!The only complaint I have about the hotel is that I'm still dealing with a billing issue. I had pre-paid the entire hotel through American Express Travel. When checking out, instead of charging me the $150 I had spent throughout my stay, I was re-charged the entire room rate of $800 for three night. I'm sure it'll work out but annoying none the less. My only other minor gripe is the lobby. There is a GORGEOUS view of the Tokyo tower from the lobby, but it is obscured by the check-in desk. Why not move the registration desk somewhere and make the area by the windows a lobby bar/lounge so people can hang out and enjoy the view. The sitting areas in the lobby are oddly placed although they have uncomfortable furniture. Move the check-in desks and put some chairs by the window so people can enjoy the view. Add drink/food service and they'll make a lot of money! Overall, a great stay at the Park Hotel.

You can actually get to the Shiodome site without going out to the street. The hotel is also accessible to the subway. Whilst Tokyo is extremely safe, as is their subway, it is a little bit isolating walking underground as far as the hotel if you were on your own (it is very well lit and very modern though). The entrance is via an elevator taking you to the 23rd (I think) floor where the very nice lobby is located. We paid for a Tokyo Tower view rooms which I think was worth it - nice to see the skyline, the tower and traffic etc. at night. Don't count on seeing Mt. Fuji as it is often clouded over.

Almost all main visitors attractions in Tokyo can be reached using the JR Yamanote Line (green) from Shimbashi. This was a distinct benefit to us as first time visitors.We found the reception staff to be personable, knowledgeable, efficient, and anticipated our needs. They spoke good English and that was how we asked for directions to use the metro to visitors attractions, arranged to have our luggage forwarded to Kyoto or stored at the hotel, and confirmed transfer to Haneda Airport (incidentally, only 20 minutes by taxi).We consider the room we had on the 32nd floor as average to small but comfortable. It accommodated 2 open suitcases with enough space to sit and move around. Bathroom is small with adequate room for one person as that legendary Japanese institution (the heated toilet seat and accessories!) is centrally located.

I had been planning our Japan trip for about a year and I was able to book our room at the hotel six months before our stay via the hotel website. This is quite significant if you are planning a trip so far in advance. Since we were booking in the very busy cherry blossom season, I was unable to find many hotels that would let you book so far out. After booking the hotel and even before arriving in Japan, I had been in contact with the hotel concierge about three months prior to our stay. I tried calling the hotel at first but then was directed to just communicate through email (which made things much easier). The concierge was able to book several dinner reservations for us (including one of Tokyo's 3 Michelin star restaurants). Where I was impressed was that after sending them a list of my restaurant requests they replied back within several hours saying when each restaurant opened their reservation process, as well as the days that the restaurants would be closed. Since I sent my original request about three months out, most of the restaurants wouldn't accept reservations for another month. The concierge kept in contact with me and let me know as soon as they booked the reservations. In addition to the restaurant reservations, they also purchased the hard to acquire Ghibli Museum tickets for me on my desired day (just make sure you ask them to purchase over a month out before your arrival). Needless to say, I was extremely happy with our choice of hotel well in advance of our stay.When we finally arrived in Tokyo we were able to easily find our way to the hotel. They provide excellent directions on their website. One thing to note is that the hotel was a little farther from the station than we had expected. Usually I choose hotels that are within a 5 minute walking radius from a public transportation hub. This hotel was a good 10 minute walk from the JR Shimbashi station. Although the walk was a little further than I was used to, the area is extremely pleasant, with far fewer crowds than other areas of Tokyo, lots of signs and maps everywhere, and is surrounded by beautiful skyscrapers. So at least the 10 minute walk is a pleasant one. I had emailed the hotel several days before hand letting them know that we would be arriving before their check-in time of 2pm and that we would need to store our luggage at the hotel while we went out. When we arrived we were surprised to find that our rooms were ready and that we could do an early check-in. I was also presented with the Ghibli Museum tickets that they had purchased, as well as detailed directions to all of the restaurants they had booked.The room itself was quite spacious for a Japan hotel (still small by western standards). There was ample space for our luggage and we did not feel boxed in or claustrophobic. The bathroom was also a good size, with more than enough counter space for both of our belongings. Although the shampoo / conditioner / body wash were provided in small bottles vs the large pump bottles that we got at every other hotel in Japan, they restocked the bottles daily so supply was never an issue. The great benefit to the room was the incredible view of Tokyo tower and Mount Fuji (on clear days). Waking up to a view of Tokyo Tower + Mt. Fuji was a special treat that I won't soon forget. One thing to note is that you will need to book a room with a Tokyo Tower view in order to enjoy this. There was a small increase in the room price, but it was well worth it. If you don't book a room with a view, then the Tokyo tower is still visible from the hotel lobby on the 25th floor.The breakfast started at 7:00am and was buffet style with Japanese and Western choices. We found the food to be well prepared and of ample variety to never get tired of the hotel breakfast throughout our six night stay. One thing to note is that they have croissants kept warm under a heat lamp. There is no better start to the day than with a warm, flaky, croissant and I always enjoy hotel breakfasts that do this properly.As a base of operations, we found the location to be very convenient. As stated above, the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the JR Shimbashi station which can get you to anywhere in Tokyo within a 30 minute subway ride. Additionally, the hotel is a 10 minute walk from the Tokyo metro Ginza and Asakusa lines. It is also three minute walk to the Tokyo metro Oedo line. If you are planning to go to Odaiba during your stay then the hotel is extremely convenient, being literally right next to one of the Yurikamome train stations. One last thing to note about the location is that the hotel is a one minute walk to the Hayao Miyazaki Steam-punk clock. This is a giant clock that looks a lot like Howl's Moving Castle. The clock puts on a little show every day at 10am/12pm/3pm/6pm/8pm. It is amazing to see and especially magical for Miyazaki/Studio Ghibli fans. Having this so close to our hotel was a special bonus for us.We never had lunch or dinner at the hotel, and never used any of the other services so I cant comment on those. One thing to note is that they do have laundry machines that you can use if you need to. This makes things convenient on long stays. In Kyoto we had to drag a suitcase full of dirty clothes to a laundromat in order to do our laundry. That wouldn't have been a problem here at this hotel.Overally we were extremely happy with the hotel. The service from the concierge, the superb view, and the convenient location will make this our hotel for any future stops in Tokyo.","Austin, Texas","JC2W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",73,5.0

We selected a Tokyo Tower view room and were not disappointed. We found that all staff understood our English and worked diligently to please. In turn our questions were answered in English, not faultless but carefully and cautiously in order not to offend.Breakfast was great, as was the one lunch we enjoyed on site.The pillows, what a curious thing! There are ones that feel as if they have small marbles in them, that can be hard when collected and pliable when separated. As I reiterate, a curious thing. However I always ask for feather/down pillows, wherever I go, and They were delivered before I could put my suitcase down in my room.WiFi, another curious thing. I travel with a phone and iPad. So does my husband. When we had all four devices WiFi switched on, we found the WiFi did not work for us. Using one or two devices at a time, we had no problems at all.The location directly adjacent to Shiodome Exit 7 & 8 is ideal. Also very close and via the amazing subterranean network, Shimbashi station is just a short walk away, most, if not all, of which can be accessed via escalator or elevator if carrying/rolling along suitcases. You do have to look for the elevators however. If you do not over think the process and follow the signage one step at a time, it becomes simpler with use.There is a convene stor on level B2, the basement. level 1 is the street level to the road outside. However reception is via lift access to the 25thnfloor. Only certain lifts go all the way from 25th level to B4, the lowest level, which is the carpark.

It's in a brilliant location, next to Shimbashi and Shiodome Station and easy walking distance to all the shops and restaurants in Ginza. I booked online and discussed room options via email. The hotel staff were very helpful and gave me a better rate than the big online booking services. I loved the look of the artist rooms that they have: rooms entirely hand painted by many contemporary Japanese artists in varying media and styles. The Park Hotel has a great policy of promoting and supporting contemporary Japanese artists.My first preference was for the Geisha Goldfish room, but this had been booked out. I got my second choice ""Festival"" and we loved that room. The hotel offered us a special rate to change to another artist room rather than to the normal room we had booked for the rest of our stay and it was too good to refuse. The second room was called ""Otafuku Face"" and had a lovely, big happy Japanese face with beautiful, lush, painted cherry blossoms across the entire room, walls and ceiling. Apparently this room is a favourite, probably because it also has an amazing view of the Tokyo Tower.There was something really special about staying in the artist rooms and I definitely thought it was worth the small extra cost. The rooms themselves are a good size, with very comfortable beds, good air con, quiet and great lighting. Huge picture windows give lots of natural daylight. The bathrooms are very nice with the multi functional Japanese toilets, deep soaker bath and shower. I loved the retractable line for drying small handwashed items. The toiletries were gorgeous, all lovely botanicals by Thann. My favourite was the shower gel. Apart from a very nice toothbrush and folding comb/brush, the hotel also supplied a great washing and scruffing cloth and I'll confess to hoarding a few of these. They last quite a lot of washes and are just textured enough to bring a glow to your skin without rasping. I'm still using the one from the hotel 4 weeks later. Wish I'd bought more of the Thann products in Omotesando to remind me of our trip.Everything about the Park Hotel was above our expectations. Great rooms, fast lifts, beautiful and interesting art displays, delightful staff and service. The staff were wonderful; always saying hello and smiling as we went past. The reception/concierge helped us out with directions, maps, airport shuttles and booking a special restaurant that was notoriously hard to get into. Everything was easily and calmly achieved. In a busy city like Tokyo, the Park Hotel was a blissful quiet haven to come back to each evening. Another bonus of this hotel's location is its proximity to the huge Ghibli clock that animates and the inexpensive restaurants in the Shiodome buildings. It's a 10 minute amble up to the Ginza shopping strip.There's a good local market/supermarket on the way to Ginza (about 5 minutes from the hotel) that has everything you might want: milk, snacks, fruit and drinks. It caters to locals and has an amazing array of fresh and frozen seafood. Everything is in Japanese, not English so learn some key words or use a translation tool like Google Translate to translate images of text from products. Or just try your luck since just about everything in Japan tastes good.I highly recommend this hotel to any type of traveller, but especially to those with a love of modern art.

I have traveled the world extensively and I was extremely pleased with this hotel. Although my room was on the smaller side - I never felt it at all. Why ? Because the design of it was incredible. Everything was placed logically and there was even a desk and a chair to watch tv. The bathroom was superclean and, while not spacious, was not missing anything at all. Shower was perfect temperature and strong. Sink and toilet (although I don't need or want all that TOTO Japan stuff) were good. Staff was awesome, never overwhelmed, and always helpful. The hotel was quiet because it's in the middle of a massive office park. Yes, you can actually walk outside and go to a few nearby shops and restaurants that are fun and not ""skanky"". But the true gem of this hotel is that it is in the middle of ""nowhere"". The key is that it is quiet when you sleep. But, when you are ready to embrace Tokyo for all that it offers - the extremely close train (and subway if you need it) service is available immediately.

Room 3303 was quieter and had unobstructed views. Hotel has pretty much direct access to Shindome station and Shimbashi stations so really convenient . The hotel has an atrium area with a lounge bar where you can have light snacks and where you have breakfast. It has a bar with nice views and two restaurants, one Japanese and one French. We ate at the Japanese and also had a light snack and afternoon tea at the lounge bar. All very pleasant. Breakfast had a good selection of Western and Japanese style food, my only complaint would be that there were very view suitably high tables and often we had to sit on very low armchairs designed more for comfort than for eating. The overflow room is not as pleasant so try to have your breakfast in the lounge. Service was a little slow at times but always very charming. The rooms are quite small and we initially thought this was because of being in Tokyo but due to a last minute change of itinerary we stayed one night at Villa Fontaine next to the hotel in a twin room ( but not single beds ) and this was almost double in size ( room 404 ).

In one respect that's a little bit of a risk because if you're not satisfied at the beginning you're kind of stuck with the second reservation. However, we were so glad that we did - the location and stay were both excellent. We selected a 'high room with Tokyo tower view', which was worth every penny. The rooms are not especially large, but very comfortable. Bathrooms are fine, if a little dated compared to some of the other hotels we stayed in. Any small shortcomings of the room itself are completely overcome by the views over Tokyo. We stayed on the 32nd and 33rd floors during our two stays and we spent a great deal of time just looking out of the window, comparing what we saw to our maps of Tokyo and taking in the excellent view from above. You're not only treated to a Tokyo tower view, but also a cracking vista of Mount Fuji on clear days. Fantastic. My one minor disappointment with the stay was the price of breakfast, however I must say that I have that feedback of all four hotels we stayed in during our Japan trip. Costs approaching £20 per person for breakfast that, while of excellent quality, I have enjoyed for free in many European hotels. Well, OK, maybe not the dried fish, pickles and miso soup (all of which exceptionally tasty, if you can entertain those foods for breakfast.) very good cappuccino and espresso available upon request and included in the price of breakfast. The staff were very good indeed, with all of the attentiveness and politeness it is too easy to become accustomed to whilst staying in Japan. With the very few requests that we had for them they were excellent. Oh, almost forgot - 'The Society' bar in the lobby offered a dizzying array of outstanding whiskies, albeit almost 100% Scottish. Japan has so many wonderful whiskies (many now rated far better than their scotch counterparts) that I had expected a far better array. So, note to the hotel - please embrace your domestic whiskies more and offer the visitor more tastes of Japan. Lastly - while the bartenders are very good and make a mean cocktail (mean in terms of both quality but also size, I'm afraid) and are able to provide some good recommendations good grief the drinks are expensive. Add to that a per person 'cover charge' then popping in for a drink or two became prohibitively expensive.

If you need to visit Odaiba, the train station is just right outside of the hotel. Tsukiji fish market is one subway station away. If you like shopping, it's just one JR station away from Yurakucho, where you can find 0101, Lumine, and many other shops. Of course, Tokyo tower view is this hotel's strongest selling point. This hotel does not have many restaurants, but you can find many nearby the hotel. The room is clean and comfortable, not very big, but already larger than many other hotels in Tokyo. Since it is very close to the railway, you may hear a little train noise in the room, which to me is acceptable.There are limousine bus going to Narita airport and Haneda airport, but not frequent. So you need to check the bus schedule carefully.Staffs can speak very good English, which is quite impressive.Hotel lobby is on 25th floor. Lift entrance at ground floor is a little difficult to locate though.

We started our descent and the alarm kept going, only after ~20 mins and when we were at the 12th floor did it change to 'this has been a false alarm'. On reaching the ground floor in a dark foyer we found a single security guard who didn't speak English and a lady who had no ID and told us to get in a lift back up. Funny but people refused initially. The various explanations that we were given didn't work logically.

We wanted to try the hotel because it was a TripAdvisor Travellers' choice winner for romance.Pros 1. The hotel / room is stylishly designed. 2. They provide Thann toiletries. 3. The concierge was very helpful. 4. Free wi fi in room. Cons 1. Location - although it is connected by several train lines, 3 of the lines are quite a walk away via underground - in Shimbashi station - not shiodome itself. There are 2 Family mart convenience stores downstairs - and many restaurants , but it's not the most convenient base for shopping. 2. Noise - we were on the 32nd floor, but it was really noisy (till late night) from the trains and for some reason, there were regular sirens going off every night of our 3 night stay - not sure if the hotel is situated near a fire dept or police station...perhaps we were just not given the 'right' rooms with the views that everyone was raving about...3. Comfort - pillows and bed were too soft. Even with 2 pillows (1 of them buckwheat) it didn't make for a comfortable night's sleep4. Facilities / amenities : there is a gym - which you can only use if you make a reservation in advance. We tried to get a slot on the same day but slots were full.5. Last but not least, we asked for a 1 hour extension to the standard check out time of 12 pm and was told immediately that we would be charged for every hour we extend. They would not even grant us a 30 min courtesy extension. To be fair, the staff were all pleasant, just that the hotel policy is not. In conclusion - there were more cons than pros for our stay at this hotel. Having stayed at other tourist / business hotels near Ginza and in Shinjuku, in a similar price range, we expected a certain standard, and sadly it fell short.

Bathrooms and rooms are fully equipped with amenities, safe, hair dryers, multi standard electrical plugs, brushes, washing clothes, toothpaste, lotions and shower gels by Thann, ...Front desk staff even offered us to take the Japanese style pijamas robes home as souvenir when we asked if we could buy a set.Didn't manage to try the hotel restaurants as there are plenty of eateries in the immediate neighbourhood, even in the basement from the main Shiodome Tower building where the hotel is located. There is also a 24 hours Family Mart convenience store with hot food too and alcoholic drinks including beers, wines and Japanese whisky if you crave for something in the middle of the night. Within walking distance halfway towards the Shinbashi Station there is Caretta a full shopping mall offering more restaurants / cafes, fashion stores, liquor stores ...We took advantage of their airport limousine bus service bringing us safely back to Narita airport.We arrived at the requested time at the 1/F meeting lobby and our luggage was waiting for us and already tagged to be dropped at the correct terminal.In a nutshell a great tranquil location within walking distance of the major Yamanote Line JR train loop connecting you to all parts of Tokyo.A budget friendly fairly spacious accommodation and super friendly hotel staff.Next time we're in Tokyo we will definitely be back at the Park Hotel!

My husband likes trains, so he watched the trains on eight tracks going in and out of Shimbashi station below, including the bullet train.With the help of the concierge in the hotel and maps in the underground passage, we figured out the subway system. We had a problem at Ueno station finding the footbridge to get over the tracks to the park and museums. Answer: stations have a policeman who manages English and can tell you which way to go. For westerners there is a bakery shop on the 1st floor of the Shiodome Media Tower (where the hotel is located starting on the 25th floor) where you can get goodies for breakfast. We take Starbucks instant coffee packets and use these in the morning. And when the bakery is closed on the weekends either go to Delifrance bakery in the underground passage, or to Printemps French department store in Ginza, lower level, and buy some wonderful bakery goods for the next morning.Also, have the concierge write out the name of where you want to go in Japanese if you plan to take a taxi anywhere.

Such a nice bar they have yet still serving me Hendrick's Gin & Tonic without cucumber (had to insist and send the drink back to be fixed) despite a 2nd visit, is a a real pity.

Getting around is simple, it's located at the Shiodome subway station and 7 mins walk to the Shimbashi train station via a sky walk between business buildings. across the street from the hotel you'll find Tokyo's biggest salary men's area, tons of small restaurants/bars/clubs and if you go the ""brighter"" side there's the famous Ginza, where most expensive shops reside. And it is it's very easy to transfer to Tokyo station for day trips or Hamamatsucho for Haneda airport monorail.The breakfast buffet was very good, plus you have the option to have breakfast at a popular shushi restaurant at Tsukiji fish market, one stop from the shiodome station. You each get a set worth about 2,000 yen which is quite filling, not as good as those famous ones such as Sushi Dai but much better than any sushi place outside of Japan...the fish is fresh and that's a given, but the Japanese rice is the one that made the difference, you almost cannot buy Japanese rice outside of Japan because they just grow enough for domestic consumption, only a small quantity is exported if you are lucky to find them at home.

You can also walk to Shimbashi and Ginza at late night for food and shopping, it was safe and convenient.Views - the view from the lobby is going to take your breath away. First you notice Tokyo Tower literally a bit too close, then in the background is the gorgeous Mount Fuji. No wonder people just stop moving as they walk into the reception area.Check in - efficient and reception spoke English at a much higher level than the average Japanese hotel receptionist. However flat out denied requests rather than the standard 'try to arrange, no guarantees', but maybe this is a cultural difference.Now the problems:i stayed in a single room. It was a bit compact. And the views were less stunning than what you thought it would be; it faced the Conrad next door. The biggest problem was the problem I had with the wifi. There was no wifi in the room. I don't know if that's a design fault, but the staff member sent up with a router seemed to suggest that it was pretty common that these rooms couldn't get wifi. But even with a router plugged in, the internet was painfully slow. If i had serious business to do online, I would be very frustrated. This hotel charges 24,000 JPY a night, 3-4 times higher than a lot of other hotels where speedy wifi is a pretty default amenity provided without misses. When I questioned this further, the staff didn't seem bothered to deal with this issue and just shrugged their shoulders.I think the room would be worth 16-17,000 JPY a night, but not at a 20,000+ premium where I can get a lot of hotels with the similar calibre.But yet still the location was too good so I might have a second stay, or in a nearby property instead next time.",Hong Kong,"cx806</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",44,3.0

The mini bar was stocked well for my unwell partner to have some cool water on arrival and snack later in the night.. Bathroom was spotless with an assortment of offerings such as shampoo conditioner toothbrushes etc... The only downfall was we often got the train to shin bashi as that was the most convenient for us but once we realised toei shiodome was closer and half the walk then we used that a little more.. Hotel was a little hard to find initially but once he had found it it was easy!! Most of the things we did required a bit of travel however it was quite lively only a couple of streets away for an easy feed on our first night :) we didn't have meals included but u figured that was made up for with the amazing view!! Staff were always very helpful and welcoming - no problems with English and if they did they could refer us to someone who's English was better.. Highly reccomend this hotel for all travel types, it was overall safe, clean, great environment and reasonable price for the service and quality of the rooms.

There were lots of very good restaurants and cafes in the immediate area but it did take a little while and quite a bit of walking to work out where the majority of them were. The hotel itself is very nice and well run, the rooms are quite small but the size in workable. The whole hotel including rooms is very clean and comfortable. and all the staff are extremely helpful. They stored our luggage on our last day until our evening flight and were very obliging when we needed to access bags to repack for some shopping. We booked airport bus transfer through the hotel and they delivered our luggage to the front of the hotel and had it loaded on the bus, fabulous service. The only meal we had there was breakfast and for 2400yen was just average. The coin laundry for me (travelling with 2 teenagers) was a plus when deciding a hotel, unfortunately this was not a good experience, they have 2 washer dryer combos, the wash cycle was fine but the clothes were still damp after 8 hours of pumping coins into the machine, we were leaving on the bullet train next morning so had to hang all the heavy clothes around the rooms and turn the heating up to get them dry, not good. I did report this to staff but they didn't seem to think it was an issue or that we had spent almost 3000yen in the dryers, wish I'd looked for a coin laundry. Apart from this I'd certainly recommend this hotel as it was a very pleasant stay. We stayed at this hotel twice during our trip to Japan and the first time paid more for Tokyo Tower view, which was excellent, on our return we had standard rooms and the view was over the gardens and down to the water, beautiful view, I think I'd just recommend standard and you can see Tokyo Tower from the foyer.","Wollongong, Australia","LauraWollongong</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wollongong, Australia</strong>",15,4.0

It is a less busy tower of the otherwise busy Shiodome area. You can't be more central: there is a metro stop in the same building, which takes you anywhere you want. It is also a good place to stay if you attend a fair in Tokyo Big Sight/Ariake, as it is on the private Yurikamome line which takes you there in 30 min.Reception and restaurants make one floor, everything is elegant, quiet and efficient. Staff speaks ok English -not all of them, but there is always somebody on hand to help the less anglophile ones. All front office issues are sorted out well, a bit slow maybe, but generally good. Yes, I also had wrong bill compositions and credit card issues, and yes it took a bit of time to sort out, so my hint is to do it the evening before check-out.There is many different room types to choose from from the reservation menue -not sure if they are really different and what the differences really are. Most room names sound like gift packages. I took a standard corner room. It was indeed small but at the end all I needed. Bathroom small as well but sufficient if you are not over 100kg. There are good amenities, coffee/tea making facilities and everything is spotlessly clean. As it is a tower hotel, all rooms have great views. I am not sure if it is worth paying more for 'Tokyo tower view'...Breakfast is the traditionally weird choice of 'western' and 'japanese' -the western option being good but still with all the strange mixes of western items that only Japanese chefs can produce. The Japanese option remained a mystery as most food for non-Japanese was not to be identified, but it looked all fresh and delicous. Both breakfast options are reasonably priced for Tokyo standards.Staff in general friendly, courteous and efficient -smooth operators as everywhere in Japan. The complete package of this hotel I liked very much. It is not one of those large chains, but still offers service similar, and people there are nice and friendly. Location is most perfect if you are attending the fairs, or if you are ok with being close to Ginza, Ebisu, Shinagawa and Southern parts.I do recommend this hotel very much, I simply like it and I enjoy coming back.","Berlin, Germany","LalaiDama</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",22,5.0

The hotel is about 30 minutes by subway from most places we were going to (Shibuya, etc.), it wasn't a problem for us but something to keep in mind.Also, when checking out the hotel asks you if you want them to charge your card in your currency or yen. The hotel's currency conversion rate is not the actual currency conversion rate of that day but a conversion rate wherein the yen is slightly stronger so if your card doesn't charge foreign transaction fees ask for them to charge you in yen since your credit card uses the REAL conversion rate.

The scrambled eggs were quite disgusting, and there was no option of having your eggs cooked the way you liked. There was only a single two slot toaster and no hot milk.

That's in the bustling Shinjuku area and is approximately five times more expensive than this hotel. If you're someone who thinks nothing of the price differential, then maybe we should go out sometime so you could put a ring on it. Otherwise, the Park Hotel is a smart, gorgeous accommodation in the Shiodome Media Tower occupying the 25th through 34th floors. My partner and I spent five nights here, and we thought it was a terrific deal for the bargain rate of $145 per night, tax included.First of all, the location is aces especially for a first-time visitor like my partner since it took us only ten minutes to walk to Tsukiji Market at an ungodly hour and only fifteen minutes to get to the heart of the Ginza at any time. Just a quick stroll on an elevated walkway with the oddball Hayao Miyazaki steam-punk clock along the way, the Shimbashi station is a major hub for many of the key train and subway lines including the all-important JR Yamamote line with Tokyo station just two stops away. Second, the room, while smallish, was not lacking for amenities including a most titillating toilet that hummed along with my euphoria.It also afforded a spectacular view that included Tokyo Tower brightly lit at night. Third, the service here was impeccable with everyone able to speak English with amazing clarity. Most impressive was the concierge, a young woman who was raised in Sri Lanka, schooled in Canada and spoke English better than me. You won't get lost in translation here. She provided clear directions to anywhere in the city with ease and accommodated my last-minute requests for reservations at Kyubei Sushi and the Robot Restaurant. She rocked.

After some negotiation, the hotel offered a suite on the top floor of the hotel that could accommodate four people, albeit for an additional amount per night.After that bad start, the rest of our stay was wonderful. Concierge services excellent, helping to get us around the city. Breakfast in the open air atrium was plentiful and, happily, served much more than a western breakfast. (Who travels to Japan and wants to eat eggs and bacon there?!)The view from the suite was amazing, overlooking the whole city. The hotel was filled with what seemed to us like business travelers but the vibe in the atrium was artsy. information abounded about art exhibitions, and the walls of the multi-story atrium were lit at night with projections of art.Hotel is located a short walk from the fish market and from the Ginza district.

Coming from Shimbashi Station, we followed the maps and finally found a side entrance to the hotel. We took the elevator up to the 25th floor and were able to check in a bit early. We booked the Tokyo Tower view as it wasn't too much more than a regular view room and we wanted our last view days in Japan to be memorable. The view was awesome, especially at night when the tower was lighted. We also enjoyed watching the subway cars and shinkansen going to and from Shimbashi Station on the tracks below.

But I also like hotels to function, smoothly and efficiently. The Park Hotel certainly has style and an impressive reception area on the 25th floor with great city views - but it is far from perfect. I checked in on a Sunday at 4pm to be told the restaurant was full for the evening and the bar could only start serving a range of foods (beyond olives or a sandwich) from 5.30pm. Indeed the listless afternoon bar staff certainly looked like more training was needed to provide the more customary attentive Japanese customer service. Salvation, however, lies in the comfortable and spacious rooms - but which side of the building you are on is also important - views of Tokyo Tower and Mount Fuji on one side; office blocks, roads and trains on the other. It's worth asking! For dinner I recommend the Sky 47 restaurant in the Caretta Shiodome less than 5 mins walk away - very welcoming and food is readily served! One more tip - Don't rely on airport bus transfers from the hotel for early flights - the first pick-ups are after 8am. Quickest route to Haneda is a 12 minute walk to Hamamatsucho and then 20 minutes on the Monorail (490 yen), or if you have luggage you can join at Shimbashi next to the hotel for a 2 minute ride on the JR Yamanote line to Hamamatsucho before changing to the monorail (one ticket will connect all the way to the airport).","London, United Kingdom","John M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",1,3.0

Costs we moderate and we were very happy with the price/value ratio. The only negative was the fitness center - literally a small room with a treadmill and an elliptical and not well maintained.

The staff are friendly and courteous. There is a good lobby area where breakfast is served.

The upgrade also gives access to the Club Lounge, but this is not worth having as there is nothing much there. The room is very comfortable, with a good bathroom.The breakfast was good. Not a huge choice but what they had was well prepared and presented. We didn't eat in the restaurants but they looked nice.Wifi is free and reliable.The hotel is next to Shiodome Metro station, but this is only on the Yurikamome line which is not so useful. However it's only a short walk to Shimbashi Station which is a great connecting station for several Metro lines and also the JR line so it's easy to get to most places including Tokyo Station for the Shinkansen.

The hotel is located on one of the higher floors of a sky scraper. The atrium/lobby provides gorgeous views of Tokyo tower both at night and during the day. The concierge speak good English and are very friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is not cheap and is more on the luxury side. There is a lovely sitting area within the lobby and off in separate rooms are a bar area and a restaurant, we tried both the bar and the restaurant and the buffet breakfast - all of which I could not praise enough. The bar is apart of some sort of whisky association and they have some top quality drinks to try and possibly the most delicious peach bellini I've ever drunk before. The restaurant next door is a fusion of French/Japanese and whilst the portions seem small they are definitely fulfilling and delicious. The breakfast buffet also boasts an impressive spread - there are both Japanese and western options and everything tastes really fresh and nothing seemed dry or old. The breakfast seating can fill up quickly so I'd advise to go down as soon as possible to ensure you snag a seat.We booked one of the corner rooms with a view of the Tokyo Tower and I can't say much more then wow. The room was spacious and luxurious - the bathroom for Japanese standards was quite large and impeccably stocked. The bed, by Australian standards they'd basically pushed two huge king sized beds together - no complaints here it made for the most comfortable sleep I've ever had. During the day the heat from the sun can be quite strong against the windows but there is A/C in the rooms so you won't suffer. If you're lucky enough you might even be able to catch a glimpse of the mountains in the skyline, this is one of the most amazing sights I have ever seen. Waking up in the morning and seeing Tokyo tower and the sunrise AND THE MOUNTAINS! Break taking. Also there is a belief that if you and your loved one are awake and looking at Tokyo Tower before they shut the lights off you will be together forever.Overall whilst this hotel is on the pricey side it is worth every penny.","Melbourne, Australia","ryjs_is</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",23,5.0

It was really fancy as corny as that sounds. I guess for me when I am used to Hampton Inn's and that sort of hotel this seems like a whole different level. Honestly the food there was overpriced for our budgets. The juice was around 700-800 yen for a glass. We ended up eating elsewhere as there was a lot to see and do in a short walking distance. Just downstairs from the hotel was a little place called MOMI's and TOY's which was fabulous for a quick cheaper breakfast. Otherwise the subway and the Family Mart in the basement are always great quick stop spots. The rooms here are a bit condensed. But not to be unexpected. The views from every room are extraordinary. I loved looking out the window and when not raining, being able to see the sprawl of Tokyo. All of the rooms are the 26th floor or higher. I think up till 32. But not sure. They seemed to have really nice amenities in the bathroom and the hotel staff were exceptionally helpful. When you do go, be sure to go to the right hotel.

I also rented a mobile wi-fi hotspot for this trip from Japan Wireless. I made arrangements for it to be delivered to the Park Hotel. During the check-in, one of the staff members brought me the package (without me even asking - hows that for excellent service). The staff member who brought our luggage to the room, took the time to explain the amenities of the room, hotel and the location of the emergency exits (and again, without us asking). Excellent service again! The room, as others have mentioned is on the larger size for Japanese standards. The bedroom was well organized and clean. The bathroom was also in the same condition (clean and organized). The breakfast buffet starts at 7am. A good assortment of Western and Japanese food. The only minor suggestion I have for the Hotel would be to start the buffet at 6:30am instead of 7am. The hotel is connected to the subway underground path which made it extremely convenient to explore the city. There is also restaurants within walking distance (about a 10 minute leisurely walk - the hotel is also connected to an outside pedestrian bridge, which made crossing the street safe and simple). You can also walk to the Ginza area too for more restaurant options and shopping (about a 15 - 20 minute leisurely walk). There's a Family Mart convenience store and a couple of restaurants in the basement of the hotel. We didn't use room service because of the restaurant options. Apparently there is also a coin-operated washing machine on the 26th for the guests to use. Check-out was the same as the check-in process (very efficient and professional). We took the airport limo (a bus from the hotel to the airport - cost was approximately 1000 yen/person). The airport limo tickets can be purchased at the concierge. We probably would have taken the airport limo from Haneda to the hotel if we knew about it (will definitely use this option when we visit Tokyo and stay at the Park Hotel again). The concierge offered to mail the wi-fi package back to the rental company, Japan Wireless, this is without me even asking (he saw that I was carrying a package which needed to be mailed)!And finally...Neither my wife nor I can speak Japanese (my wife can read some very basic Japanese words), and it was very appreciated that the staff took their time to patiently speak to us in English.

It is above Shiodome station, which via the Oedo line gets you to Shinjuku or the fishmarket in the other direction, among many other destinations obviously. The new driverless Yurikamone Line head over to Obeida district, (which is well worth a trip. You go over the Rainbow bridge and there is some amazing architecture there not to mention a Venetian themed shopping mall) and the entrance to that is right outside the hotel on the 3rd floor. Otherwise Shimbashi station is close which we used a lot for the Ginza line, or the JR lines for places like Tokyo station (for a trip to Tokyo Disney), or for the fast train to Kamakura, also highly recommended. Bring your swimwear in the summer and check out Kamakura beach. We arrived via the Narida Express and then took the Yamanote line to Shimbashi from Tokyo station and walked from there. Beware, there are lot of steps and in the heat of the summer (not to mention the humidity) it was a bit of a slog with luggage, so taxi is an option I guess. Once we wandered in the underground area of Shimbashi/Shiodome once or twice, generally we found our way around quite easily. There are also great above ground walk ways which help (level 3 from hotel). The reception is on level 25 of the Shiodome Media tower, which is a distinct triangular building. Note, do not confuse the Park hotel with the Royal Park hotel Shiodome, which is confusingly just next door in the Shiodome complex. The room was great as we stayed in an artist room on the 31st floor (Zodiac room), and we had amazing views towards the city and Tokyo Tower as well as Mt Fuji (only visibly as a barely there outline due to haze during the whole 9 days we were there). The room is snug, but enough room to happily spend the evenings there after a whole day walking about Tokyo. The window seat is a treat. The bathroom is perhaps best described as cozy, but features a Japanese toilet (heated seat, discreet noises to mask, uhm, naturally occurring ones. Rinse, lather, repeat anyone?), which we got used to very quickly and now miss. Also plenty of toiletries and also some coffee/tea making facilities and a mini fridge in the room. The mattress was relatively hard, but we both slept well every night, so no complaints there. It is also very quiet and the trains don't run all night so we had no problems. To keep within budget we ate lunch out and about most days and got dinner from one of two Family Marts (convenience stores) which are downstairs in the subway area of the building. They serve very tasty ready meals and they will heat them up for you as well. Not to be confused with any convenience store food I’ve come across in the rest of the world, this stuff ranges from fresh salads and fruit to ramen, udon, sushi, chicken, pork dishes and also some western food such as spaghetti carbonara or pasta with tomato sauce. They also have a great selection of cold beers and wines, as well as sake and juices, water etc. And they have desserts, and no trip to Japan is complete without sampling the sweets here (just make sure you don’t need fillings as they really like it sweet!). So we loved the Family Marts and were regulars quickly.We ate once at the hotel itself at their Japanese restaurant (see separate review) and did not have breakfast other than room service on my birthday, which was plentiful and yummy. We usually had breakfast at the Tulleys café reached via the subway level of the hotel (only the far right elevator goes to that level!) and walk until you get to the Kinkos/Family Mart. The café is outside across from there. There is also a way to get there from the above ground walkways. They have great hotdogs, buns, pancakes and very good coffee. There is a funky and rather large clock which looks like it ought to be in Alice in Wonderland that does a display (it toots, honks and blows steam) every hour on the hour, which is a couple of levels up from café and also reached from the level 3 walkways. We used the concierge twice and her English is impeccable, thanks to some schooling in Canada. She was very helpful and found us a great and affordable Kaiseki, as well as other bookings. The free in-room Wi-Fi was fast and a great amenity to have, in fact it was one of the reasons we booked this hotel. Oddly, Japan isn’t as much of a paradise for internet surfing or telephony as one might think unless you have a Japanese contract/SIM, so it was very helpful. The welcome sake was much appreciated and if I am ever lucky enough to return to Tokyo, I would definitely stay there again. Even a (false) early morning fire alarm didn’t spoil things and made for an interesting experience.","Auckland, New Zealand","JDKS6666</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",24,5.0

I mainly picked this hotel because it was reasonably priced (compared to other places in Tokyo) and the views. I got a room on the 33rd floor which had a pretty nice view over the train tracks and if you stepped right up to the window you could see the harbour. So pretty satisfying but maybe just a bit sad compared to the amazing pictures on their website. I guess you need to pay for the pricier rooms. The room was fairly small but with a few furniture moves, it was quite comfortable. Provided amenities are very good.The location has positives and negatives. If you're staying in Shiodome because you want to see Shiodome, then you're set. Anywhere else you want to go is fine unless you're good with walking - even if you're getting the train. You'll do more walking than you think because everything underground seems quite spread out but mainly because unless you're a local or some kind of genius, you will get lost a lot. Despite doing it three times, I didn't once successfully navigate my way from Shinigawa station to the hotel. There was a lot of walking around, back-tracking, staring at station maps, pouring over google maps, crazed rambling through shopping centres... None of this is the hotel's fault and it's actually quite well signposted and close from the local Shiodome subway station. If you master getting to and from trains, it's well connected to lots of the cool things to do in Tokyo. When in the area, I definitely recommend walking around on the 3rd floor walkway which connects the major hotels, offices and shopping centres. If you get lost, get up there as it's easy to see and they have directions. It's a straightforward 15 minute walk to the fish markets.I didn't eat in the hotel but strongly recommend heading down to the Family Mart in the basement level of the building for breakfast or other meals and snacks. It's a convenience store but way better than you would get in Australia or many other parts of Asia.I had a late flight and asked whether late check-out would be possible. Whenever I've asked this previously, I've always been offered at least one hour free of charge. In this case, he immediately told me an hourly rate of 1500 yen per hour for a maximum of 4 hours. I thought this charge was a little steep but I guess it's not totally unreasonable.There was an earthquake which could definitely be felt but the hotel didn't fall down, so that's good.","Sydney, Australia","michelle a</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",29,4.0

The hotel location is awesome and you can get to anywhere in Tokyo from either the station connected to the hotel 3rd floor or from shinbashi about 10mins walk. Ginza is 10-15mins walk. We arrived on a Sunday and took the train from the airport to Nippori station and JR to shinbashi. Here we got confused a little, so instead of dragging out suitcases around took a taxi to the hotel (730JPY). I would recommend the train route for weekends, but not for weekdays as JR can be crazy busy. We took the direct shuttle on the way back, and was much more convenient. Just make sure to book your shuttle much in advance as it sells out quickly. They say it takes 2hrs, but for us on a Saturday return, it took just 75 minutes. The hotel main lobby is on 25th, so took the elevator there. Check in was smooth, staff spoke decent English, and we were given a nice room on the 31st floor with zodiac art and a lovely Tokyo tower view.The room was nice, a bit on the smaller side, but efficient. It was well stocked and comfortable/cozy. All standard accessories were provided. We do have to ask for an iron, but also saw a laundry facility with ironing board on the 26th floor. Did I mention the view was awesome. I am sure in nicer weather with less haze Mt Fuji could be seen from the room. The room is quiet, except for a light hum from the trains. Not disturbing in any way, but just something we noticed as we live in quiet rural setting. I actually enjoyed watching many kinds of trains passing by. (My secret fun thing to do was to go up from 1st to 25th floor using the corner accessible elevator, which gave an amazing perspective of Tokyo). The staff was very polite and courteous. We tried the breakfast on a couple of days, and found it to be satisfactory. Nothing memorable though, besides good service and am interesting lobby area that opens up to the top of the building. We also tried the Thaan spa for a massage. It was quite relaxing, and nicely done. The hotel is connected at the 3rd floor to other buildings. There was kind of a street festival going on when we visited, so it was fun to see some jpop etc. The only bit of a let down was that there is no swimming pool. Not a deal breaker, but having enjoyed some awesome highfloor pools in HK, it would have been icing on the cake. Also, tripadvisor lists one of the area for the hotel as odaiba, while odaiba is reachable from here by a 15/20 minute train ride, the hotel is in shinbashi/shiseido not odaiba. Overall, a nice experience, friendly staff, and central location that even a first time visitor can manage. Will stay again.

There was a lingering smell of cologne and body odour and the carpet was filthy. I called down to the desk and asked about switching rooms. They sent someone up and he showed us three other rooms, all for a slightly higher cost per night but it was like night and day. Our new room, which was about $50 more per night (a savings from about $80 normally), was fantastic. It was huge with a massive bay window and amazing views from the 27th floor. The Thann Casa suite was very clean and had a nice big bathroom with good quality toiletries. There was a projector on the ceiling that you could turn on that had a fish pond video playing out on the top of the bedding (this is seriously hard to explain but was very cool). We could see the Tokyo Skytree from our room along so night time was great with all the lights. Overall the hotel is pretty good, the staff were a little weird at times and I wasn't crazy about the location so I would most likely never stay here again but the room was very nice for the last part of our Japan trip. I would recommend staying closer to main stations while in Tokyo and this hotel is a bit of a walk from Shinbashi station but it took another 5-10 minutes to wait for two different elevators to get to our room. As others mentioned, the lobby is on the 25th floor so you need to get up to there first with only one elevator operating. This was poor planning on their part as it got quite annoying and made it hard for us to go back to rest in the afternoon before dinner.

We didn't try the (expensive) breakfast, there is a Family store in the (under)ground floor of the building where you can get food etc. Staff is very friendly and helpful, e.g. when it comes to make bookings at restaurants or help with directions.Only small things: As usual in modern high-rise buildings, there's no possiblity to open the window and let some air in (not even the option to open a window for some inches, as you sometimes can even on high floors). The bathroom/toilet had a little smell, which must have come from the drainage system, and I guess there is not much the hotel can do about it. The toilets (washlet style) are comparatiely old with not so many features, but that didn't bother us.The location is very good, as the hotel close to the railway and subway line, it is also close to the fishmarket. but the impression on the map is still a bit missleading, as this is a very urban area with flyovers and highways, so you have to walk up and down quite a bit to the to the railway platforms. also, you cannot just cross the road (in some places it is not even clear how to get to the otherside of a crossing and you have to walk quite some detours).

For all other subway/JR lines (Metro Ginza Line and JR lines like Yamanote Line), there are at least 7-10 minutes walk from the hotel via the covered (sort of underground) walkway.

We stayed in Cherry Blossom and it was lovely. We were offered complimentary Sake in our room which was a nice touch , and yukata style robes and slippers were provided. It was easy to get to the hotel from Narita airport- the so called Airport Limousine service ( actually a coach) serves this hotel amongst others in the city centre and takes about 90 mins in traffic. The hotel is also close to underground stations, and is ideally located for the shopping in Ginza just a few minutes walk away (Apple, Uniqlo, Chanel, Prada etc etc). The Japanese Restaurant in the lobby was good but expensive- I think there is a European restaurant too but didn't eat there. The bar is excellent-an offshoot of the Scottish Malt Whisky Society with a good selection of Japanese and Scottish whiskies , and the barman chisels ice impressively too!As everywhere in Japan the customer service was excellent.

The hotel also sent us a bottle of sake as a thank you for booking the room - very appreciated after a long shinkansen journey! The queen rooms are compact, but we had plenty of room for our 2 huge cases and ridiculous amounts of other baggage we had accumulated.

The hotel itself is very lovely, our artist room was absolutely beautiful, and the views of Tokyo Tower from our room breathtaking, especially at night. We also were treated to complimentary sake upon arrival, a great touch! As elsewhere in Japan, everything was spotless. All that said, we felt a little less welcome here than in other locations in Japan. The staff were perfectly professional, but just not as warm and friendly as in other places we had visited over the prior week. I don't know if it was just because their usual clientele are business people or what, but it was a distinctly different vibe from other hotels/ryokans in which we had stayed. Breakfast buffet is solid, though small. Was surprised by the very Western dinner menu, including room service, but man, those BLTs were tasty! During our stay we also happened to meet one of the artists who was having an exhibition on our floor - what a fantastic guy, with beautiful work! Having local artists featured throughout the hotel was really nice. I also have to say that because this is a little more of a business/financial district, there wasn't QUITE as much right out the front door to explore as in other locations, and a little harder to find the convenience stores and such. However, it's still a short walk to the Hamrikyu Gardens and only about 15 minutes' walk to the Tsujiki Fish Market. I don't know that I'd stay here again, partly because it was a little further from what felt like the heart of all the city, and partly because of the strange, slightly uncomfortable vibe. But it was a beautiful place and a good stay. Oh and P.S.

The hotel is conveniently located (once you've managed to find it) with plenty of transport and food options in the immediate vicinity.The rooms are very small and the one we stayed in was very tired having a ragged carpet that was covered in stains and walls that were covered in scrape marks. Furniture was cheap and nasty although the bed was perfectly comfortable. There was little in the way of storage room and the safe was not the biggest we've ever come across. Wi-fi worked well in the room as did the air-conditioning. The bathroom was also tiny and again felt old and tired compared to most of the other places we stayed. This was sold to us as a ""First Class"" hotel but the room felt in desperate need of some refurbishment.The included breakfast was decent enough with a reasonable amount of choice but is just served in the lobby area which isn't particularly classy. The restaurants looked expensive and un-inspiring (both in terms of menu and ambience) so we gave them a miss and ate in some of the huge array of restaurants around the Ginza area. One evening we used the hotels cosy looking little bar but again it was a bit lifeless and lacking in atmosphere.Service was a bit mixed with some good and some not so good. For example, I went to reception to get some help to change our transfer arrangements back to Haneda but I was told that I should be doing stuff like that using the bedroom telephone. When the staff member finally agreed to help she made it clear that the phone call would be billed to our room. Not the sort of service we had to worry about at other places we stayed and rather poor for a ""First Class"" hotel.Overall this hotel is in a reasonably good location but with the poor state of the bedroom and the mixed service I'm sure there are better places to stay if you're in the Ginza area.","High Wycombe, United Kingdom","TravelsWithMyHP</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>High Wycombe, United Kingdom</strong>",100,3.0

Located on the top floors of an office building in a business district, most rooms seem to offer fantastic views, but the Tokyo Tower rooms, with an unblocked view of the tower as well as Mount Fuji, probably offer some of the more compelling city views in Asia and can't be recommended highly enough. Room size is adequate...indeed quite reasonable by Tokyo standards. The bathroom, while simple enough, is extremely clean and offers all of the necessary amenities. Service is very efficient and friendly, and we were offered a free bottle of wine simply for signing up for the hotel's loyalty programme. Special mention to the very pleasant concierge who worked hard to accommodate a last-minute, relatively specific restaurant request and came through with flying colours, even going to the trouble of creating a customised map for us. The lobby sports a Michelin-listed French restaurant which offers very reasonable and high quality set meals for lunch, but be warned that you may feel a bit underdressed in tourist attire in comparison to the business lunch clientele on weekdays. On the whole, a very good value for money option at around sgd250/night in Tokyo that is surprisingly well located for tourists yet is not subjected to the ever-present crowds of some of the more well-known districts. random tip...Ramen counter around the corner on the way to Shimbashi station (ground level...the name is in Japanese but it says 'want garlic?' underneath for some reason) was a nice find, with a massive bowl of high quality ramen running about 700 yen.","Singapore, Singapore","hayabusa7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",49,5.0

The room and the whole hotel was very clean and well maintained and the staff were very friendly.

The bathroom was a little on the small side, though workable for one or two people. The bed was very comfortable and the room was quiet, even though my room was located close to the lift area.I liked the location, only a couple of minutes walk from Shimbasi station which is on the convenient Yamanote line. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes around the Shimbasi/Shiodome area and the old part of Shimbasi is quite fascinating and only a couple of minutes walk away. From this hotel you can also comfortably walk to Yama Riku Gardens in about 10 minutes and Tsukiji fish markets are about a 20 minute walk.I can't comment on the hotel restaurant because I didn't eat there at all.

Situated in the top 10 floors of the Shiodome Media Tower in the capital’s newest shiny skyscraper district – this cutting edge art hotel brings the beauty of Japanese culture and art to the luxury hotel market.The futuristic Shiodome district opened to the public in 2002 and, as well as the Park Hotel its spectacular skyscrapers house offices, restaurants, theatres, shops and the headquarters of Nippon television, one of Japan’s national private television networks.The Shiodome area was originally a tidal marshland separating the Imperial palace from Tokyo Bay. During the Edo Period (1603-1867) the marshes were dried up and developed into residential land. Shiodome literally means “halt the tides”The Park hotel with its vaulted atrium and achingly cool bars, houses art exhibitions regularly in its public spaces but it also has some very special hotel rooms indeed.One entire floor of the hotel has been given over to the Artist in Hotel project which began in December 2012. Each room on the 31st floor is being decorated with a work of art by a Japanese artist. This project is well underway and we were treated to a view of some of the amazing rooms.Broadly themed on ""Japanese aesthetics,"" artists draw on the walls and decorate the rooms with their original paintings and art objects. A finished Artist Room is a pure art form encapsulating the creator's passion and views.Themes for the rooms include the Dragon room where a great fiery beast curls around the walls, and the Zen room which is very spiritual and peaceful. One artwork is inspired by the might of the Sumo wrestler, one by the beauty of the Cherry Blossom season. Another room becomes a forest of bamboo and one a colorful public bathhouse complete with views of Mount Fuji and comic characters taking a dip in the waters.My personal favourite was the most recently completed artist’s room ‘Geisha goldfish’ which took the artist Aki Narita seven months to complete. It is a beautiful series of murals which cover the walls of the entire room. The colourful Geisha keep watch over the bed in the centre of the room and the bright red goldfish swim all over the walls, the ceiling and even off into the bathroom!Ms Narita said “When I looked out of the window, I felt like I was inside an aquarium.”The fish give the feeling of floating and in ancient times a dream of being in a room surrounded by goldfish that are lucky charms would bring good luck to the customers who stayed there. It is stunning.Another favourite was the Zodiac room where painter Ryosuke Yasumoto decorated a room themed on the 12 signs of the Zodiac, while staying at the hotel for 11 days last year. ""I will be happy if the guests can sense the world of the humorous, old folk tale of the 12 signs of the Zodiac,"" said Yasumoto about the room filled with lively images of the animals.The cat and weasel, which are not included in the 12 signs but appeared in the folk tale about how they missed out on being chosen, are included in the room decoration. Yasumoto makes the most of the three-dimensional canvas and visitors lying on the bed can make eye contact with the tiger painted on the back wall through a mirror or spot a monkey hiding behind the curtain.Every room in the Park Hotel has its own fabulous view out over this unique city. Right outside the hotel is a first class view of the famous Tokyo tower which is modelled on the Eiffel tower in Paris. The tower has its own impressive illuminations at night and it stands out among the stunning space age skyline. At 333m high it is 13m taller than the French tower and is a symbol of the city’s post WWII re birth. It looks rather retro among the other ultra-modern buildings.The hotel is in a great location close to the world renowned shopping district of Ginza with lots of up market stores (including the biggest Uniqlo in japan) and there are also lots of art galleries and theatres nearby including the Kabuki-za Theatre.By contrast, just around the corner under the railway tracks near Shimbasi station is a network of little alleyways with tiny stand up bars and restaurants where crowds of office workers descend to eat drink and talk. Another fascinating snapshot of alternative Japanese culture.The staff at the Park Hotel make you feel very welcome indeed. They are super attentive, have very good English and are actually quite charming. One lady on the desk even apologised for our recent earthquake experience! If you are going to the Far East I cannot recommend this fabulous hotel highly enough for your very own lost in translation experience.Check out my blog at Eccentric England for some gorgeous pics of the rooms","Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom","Elaine W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom</strong>",1,5.0

The prices for drinks was cheap when compared to my city of Melbourne ($25AUD for an Appletini??).

First off, the staff is so amazing! As soon as we walked in, they welcomed us and took our bags. They even held our bags for 2 days while we went to kyoto even though we were not checking in until we got back. They were focused on their guests and providing them with the best service. The only downfall for us is that the dinner was over priced for the amount of food we received. But there are SO MANY restaurants nearby to compensate for that one little downfall. We walked to Imperial Palace, The Fish Market, Ginza District (which has tons of food), Hibaya Park, and the Himaruku Gardens. The subway is very close by. But why this made our stay incredible is because of the VIEW from the rooms. Pay a little extra and that the view of the tokyo tower. TRUST ME!!! this isn't an average view. ITs an amazing view because the rooms start from the 26th floor so you are high up and also there is a windowsill in the room and you can read or just relax near the window with an amazing view of the tokyo tower. Even though the room is smaller than we are used to, it just didnt matter. The rooms are so cozy and the hotel itself is very modern and very conveniently located. Keep in mind that to go to the fish market, you have to be there by 4 am or earlier and there are no subways running at that time. So you pretty much have to stay at a hotel that is walking distance (like this one) or take a taxi. Also, this hotel is near a ton of malls, and highrise buildings which have plenty of food options if you don't want to take a 15 minute walk to Ginza.

Or was there a change in management? In any case, the experience was different. During my first visit, the staff sought solutions like the best hotels (and businesses in general) of the world do. They went the extra mile to do so. This time, they just recited policy. There were 3 of us in our troop, arriving in Tokyo at different times. Many days in advance I asked the hotel to arrange an early check-in for my colleague. All I received in return was an explanation of policy and the recommendation of a non-option... to change the reservation to check in a day earlier earlier, thus buying an additional room-night. The morning of his arrival, I inquired about the status of the early check-in. They had no record of it and proceeded to recite policy again. The room I had was extremely small. Not worth the price I paid. But the really BIG turn-off was this... Our meeting schedule changed and we had to overnight in Nagoya. We had to change our reservation from 5 days straight to 4 days with a 1-day gap in the middle. They took advantage of this and charged a higher rate for the rooms after the re-checkin. One of the keys to maintaining a long-term business relationship is this:In any and every negotiation, never go for the last coin on the table. Leave it. They went for the last coin and thereby lost our trust. They chose greed over partnership. Nobody even asked if we would often be in Tokyo in the future. On a positive note, The views are great. The location is great. Quick walk to Shimbashi station. The lobby / atrium is impressive. ","Langenthal, Schweiz","Ravenshaw</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Langenthal, Schweiz</strong>",153,3.0

One thing to be aware of is that the hotel is on the 25th floor of the ?Media Tower and if you are dropped off by taxi/shuttle is that you will have to carry your cases up in the lift on your own so might be worthwhile if you have a stack of cases for one of you to go up in the lift and get one of the porters to come down with a Hotel Trolley.We arrived early but the Hotel asked us to come back at 12:00pm (and to leave our luggage there whilst room was being finalised) and we simply took a short walk to Hama Rikyu Gardens which was no hardship!Room was too small for us - we were on the end of a four week tour of New Zealand and had two cases and three bags.

We didn't sleep terribly well but I think that was due to jet lag rather than the room or bed. It seemed quiet enough although you could hear the trains passing through the station which is adjacent to the hotel but this wasn't enough to prevent us getting off to sleep. The hotel is labelled as an ""art hotel"" and there were various installations/exhibitions in the lobby while we were there.Restaurants included a French restaurant (which we tried and found that to be very good although purists might nitpick about whether the menu was entirely French. We had a decent bottle of red wine which, thankfully, was not served chilled as everywhere else we ate served red wine VERY chilled unless you specifically ask for it not to be. We found prices reasonable for a large hotel. There is also a Japanese restaurant which we had planned to eat in but this was full on the evening we tried to get a table, so it may be better to book if you are keen to try this restaurant. There is also a cafe area in the lobby where light meals and drinks are available. It took us a while to find the bar which is through an entrance at the back of the lobby area. However, the bar staff made excellent cocktails and there are floor to ceiling windows offering great views over the Tokyo skyline. The only real negative aspect was the service in the cafe area.

It wasn't in a super busy part which is a nice breather from visiting the busiest spots in Tokyo.

But, when we arrived our room was not ready (30 min before check-in time) and first estimate was that it takes 2 hours to be ready. After receptionist checking situation we got informed that it will be ready about 15 min. Other thing that I was surprised was that we had to ask assistance for getting our luggage to room and from lobby to down stairs; this should wok other way around. Best service experience was at breakfast. Room; spacious and light feeling; there were comfortable twin beds and one extra bed (made from sofa). Our luggage and baby strollers fitted in well. In bathroom there is a bathtub, nice to have when travelling with kids. Desk in bathroom is quite small, feeling is light and bright. Interior is modern and it suits well in this hotel in quite new skyscraper. Sound isolation was great; no noise was heard from surrounding rooms or outside.Maintenance; well, can be done better. At first dusts could be vacuum out from room footlights and bathroom floor. Bathroom could be cleaned well, there should not be hair or splash / water marks at bathtub, desk or at door. Breakfast; is served at lobby floor restaurant. Every time there was free when we arrived. Breakfast is buffet style and selection is not very wide, but good enough, hot and cold choices available. Service was good and pleasant. Baby high chairs were available. Breakfast was not included in our room price, but price was reasonable. Views; this hotel got best views of surrounding areas that I have ever seen. We could see Sky Tree and city skyline from our room. From lobby and breakfast table you can see old TV tower, Mt Fuji and city skyline. Pre request information; I have sent e-mail to hotel and asked if twin bed can be pushed together (side by side), answer was no. Reality, yes you can under bed there is wheels. In addition I asked if we can get baby bed in room, answer was no, there is no space. Reality, my opinion it would fit in room. Over all, ok but nothing more than that.

This one is in Shiodome and as a consequence it is very conveniently located to the metro and train station - it is only a couple of stops away from Tokyo station and in fact within walking distance from it. Ginza is also close by - so very convenient for shopping. The area around the hotel has not much to recommend, other than the wonderful Humarikyu Gardens and the interesting fish Market. One of the recommended trips is actually to reach the Gardens from Asakusa- your ticket will include access to the Gardens. The hotel is pretty average starting from floor 25 of Shiodome, As in many Japanese hotels the rooms are quite small - we did not have space for our luggage, but the bathrooms well proportioned. You pay extra if you have a room with a Tower view but there is really no need to do this. In fact these rooms are more noisy as they are exposed to the trains at the station.  The hotel does not have any real facilities other than a restaurant and a bar. The latter is well stocked but terribly expensive. There is a variety of options for drinking around Shiodome so you do not really need to use the hotel bar. The breakfast is a nice mix of Western and Japanese food and what I liked most was the fact that the buffet changed daily. The quality of the produce was excellent. The staff are very helpful, with excellent English, especially the Nepali concierge. In conclusion this is a middle of the range hotel with small rooms and in general with little to offer.

We stayed at the Park Hotel Tokyo 4 nights. Before our arrival, I emailed the Hotel Concierge asking for information, direction, restaurant recommendation, etc... They always quickly responded back to all of my questions in very detail. Upon arrival to the hotel, all of the staffs were greeting us with a smile and very politely with a bow. Checking in was very quick and easy. The front desk staff also provided printout of map and direction from Hotel Concierge of places that I inquired in emails to Hotel Concierge. They were so well prepared everything for us already. The young lady helped us with our luggages to our room. She showed us our room, and explained features and amenities. She then came back with a bottle of Champagne, a compliment from hotel for our anniversary. The room size is big in Japanese standard. It is actually bigger than 4-star hotel that we rented in Time Square, New York. The room was very clean and smelled good. Room amenities includes everything you need: razor and shaving cream, dental kit, hair brush, and so much more. In room, we has a kettle to boil water for coffee and tea, a small refrigerator for mini bar. The bathroom is good size. The bathroom has things that we don't have in the US: a defrosted mirror, a control panel for toilet seat warmer, water spray, and flush. The hotel location is excellent, especially for us to walk 40 minutes at 3:00 AM to see the Tuna Auction at Tsukiji Fish Market. At 3:00 AM, there is no subway available and taxi would cost too much. The Shimbashi Station is ten minutes walk connecting to the hotel's basement. The Shiodome Station is right below the hotel basement. From these two stations, you can take different subway lines to anywhere in Tokyo. It is very convenient, cost saving, time saving, and most efficient ways for transportation in Tokyo. The hotel has currency exchange machine in the lobby on 25th floor. It has a great view of Tokyo Tower from the lobby as well. The hotel has free wi-fi which was great for us to stay connected with our children at home. The breakfast buffet at the hotel was excellent with variety of both Japanese and American food choices. We tried almost everything and all tasted very, very good. There is a convenient Family Mart right below the hotel to get some snacks and drink. During our stay, all hotel staffs were so excellent, very polite, and extremely helpful with anything we need. They all can speak English very well. One thing that make this hotel so excellent than the other two hotels that we stayed in Kyoto and Osaka is the Park Hotel Tokyo has ready made map with directions of all popular attractions. This is our first trip to Japan. The Park Hotel Tokyo has made our trip so wonderful and memorial.

Well, to be honnest... because there are four hotels in Shiodome and I already tried the other three. I wanted to complete the set. Also: the Shiodome area is a very strategic place to stay. It is very well connected to big stations and it's on walking distance from Ginza (shopping area). But after staying I certainly appreciate this hotel. Of the four hotels in Shiodome, it offers the best product for the price.The lobby looks a bit odd. It is jam packed with furniture, making it hard to see what is part of the lobby or one of the in-house restaurants. The result: it is empty most of the time due to general confusion by the public. Check-in was quick and easy and the service like a 5 star hotel. Such hospitality! The rooms are fairly spacious and have a modern, Japanese / Scandinavian decor.Wifi is free and rather quick. I paid a bit extra for a ""city view room"" and indeed the view was jaw dropping! Tokyo Tower was right in front with Mount Fuji in the background on clear days. My camera was so happy with this room!Some things I did not like were the bathroom with a stand in the tub shower at breast height. I know the Japanese are not as tall as the Europeans, but why can't they build a European size bathroom in a hotel for foreign guests?

An incredible view you will struggle to beat anywhere, particularly at night with the tower lit up.All floors of the hotel are higher than the 25th level, so you are guaranteed a view of some sort. If you stay here, you will have the option of paying a bit more for a room that looks out over Tokyo Tower - I would recommend taking them up on this. You only live once and the memories of waking up to the tower and possibly Mount Fuji behind it will last forever. Seeing Mount Fuji will depend on the weather.The rooms are comfortable, modern, and reasonably sized. They contain all of the amenities you would expect and a sound bathroom. Until arriving I did not know a toilet could do so many things, though I won't go into the details.There are a few dining options on the lobby floor. We ate there a couple of times and honestly found the food to be on the average side. I think the Park Hotel has missed a trick by not putting a top class restaurant on one of the higher floors utilising that unforgettable view. Other hotels we stayed in offered better dining in better settings.The location is another good point - ideally placed for Ginza, Odaiba, the Tsukiji Fish Market and of course Tokyo Tower. This may be the absolutely perfect location for you and it may not - it all depends on what things you are mainly interested in. However, you can get on the Metro without leaving the building so nothing is really that far away. It is worth noting that the hotel is part of a mammoth complex and it can be quite hard to actually find your way in or out. Do your homework on the mapping of the area beforehand if you can.I would have to recommend the Park Hotel. It is far from a budget option, but in return for your yen you will get a slick, modern base for your adventure in this wonderful city.","Neath Port Talbot, United Kingdom","WelshTom25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Neath Port Talbot, United Kingdom</strong>",46,4.0

Staff were very friendly and accommodating, assisting us with organizing our airport shuttle the day prior to take-off. There was a guest room order-in menu, a restaurant, bar/happy hour available to the guests. Free wi-fi and TV with basic channels - both in Japanese and in English. The hotel is very close to the Shinbashi/Shimbashi JR Station and is a 10 minute or so walk away from the Tsukiji Market.

Reading some reviews, I was worried that smoking smell might be an issue. It turns out that they will only have non-smoking rooms from April 2015 so they're transitioning to a more non-smoker-friendly hotel I guess. I didn't smell any smoke during my stay there. Since our visit was quite short, we needed some help in getting dinner reservations and not wasting time waiting in line for a table or, worse, getting turned away. Ms. Yoshihara and Ms. Shimose were excellent at arranging dinner reservations and replying to our emails. We specifically asked for bars/restaurants where they do not allow any smoking. Whether or not a restaurant allows smoking is hard to figure out on the internet for an outsider. (At least it was for us.) They were immensely helpful in that aspect and suggested very lovely and fitting places. They also looked at some of the places we wanted to go to and told us which ones were non-smoking. If you're worried about your dinner or drinks getting ruined by cigarette smoke, it's very nice to know that that won't happen. Also, I stupidly forced one of my chargers into the weird/curvy outlet behind the TV and it turns out it was a locking outlet. (Now I know what a locking outlet is! Sorry!) So when it was time to check out, I couldn't get my charger out. They sent someone up to get it out right away and it looked like it was quite an ordeal. Of course, the employee apologized profusely and put in an adapter so it won't happen to the next guests. :)Room was squeaky clean. Everyone working at the hotel spoke great English.

The lobby is terribly cluttered with dated looking furniture, obscure art exhibits, and leftover Christmas decorations. Rooms are for the most part very small for a hotel in this price range. They lack any finesse or charm. Furniture is simple and somewhat worn. Beds are still in good shape, and the room was sufficiently clean. But generally, business hotels in Tokyo costing half as much are built to higher standards. The hotel’s location is good if your business is nearby, with quick access to Haneda. Otherwise the Shiodome area - built up in the early 2000’s - is rather sterile, particularly at night. If it’s a view you’re after, you might want to consider the nearby Mitsui Garden Ginza Premier. Or spend a little more and look at the Cerulean in Shibuya.

Otherwise, you could also walk to Shinbashi Station (JR Station) which is about few minutes from the hotel. You have also additional 2 options if you walk to Shinbashi Station, Asakusa metro and Ginza metro line.

The bathroom is clean and has adjustable lighting options which is good if you do not like dim lit bathroom (I don't).Depending on how you designed your itinerary and how familiar with Tokyo, this could be your hotel or might not.

It is only about 3 mins walk to Ginza as well. It is THE perfect location without the crowds you'd find at Shibuya, Ueno or Shinjuku, etc.The views from our room (Tokyo Tower Queen Room, i think that's what it's called) was just stunning that we didn't bother with any observatories or sky bars. You will never want to leave the room just for that view (try to get the city view room facing Tokyo Tower). The room is very clean and well-equipped with hair dryer and Thann brand toiletries. While the room was not huge, it was good size for two people.The concierge was just amazing with all our various requests such as helping us book restaurants, calling our next hotel for pick-up from the train station. Not only that they are very helpful, they are very quick in responding to our requests e.g. we were informed of gift items without having to ask(we got a free, small bottle of wine for 3 nights stay), the iron and board were brought to the room within 5-10 mins of calling the front desk. We also went to the bar there (good views of the city from there too) and I had the best green tea to go with my o-sake. There is also a discount for the hotel guests for the french restaurant, Tateru Yoshino. I thought I'd never say this about a bowl of carrot soup but it was just out of the world!!The only small compliant I have is the pillows. They are a bit small and not comfy enough. but we experienced the same thing in another hotel too. Maybe it's a cultural thing?Totally recommend this hotel. If you happen to choose this hotel for your stay, take these walking directions from Shimbashi station especially if you have a lot of luggage with you. This route will be the fastest and have lift access from the station to the hotel.- Assuming that you have arrived at Shimbashi station on Yamanote Line ( as most tourists will take Narita Express from the Airport to Tokyo Station), take the Ginza exit and walk diagonally to the right for about 10 seconds until you see the old Shimbashi station. - Take the escalator going up and walk straight. You will walk past Starbucks if you have taken the right-hand path. - after 10 seconds, you will see a connecting bridge on the right hand side to a tall building. Walk along the bridge and at the end of the bridge, you see a big clock and another overhead bridge / pedestrian deck ( above the intersection below) connecting to Shiodome Media Tower where Park Hotel is located. The overhead bridge will take you to the level 3 of that building where you can take the lift to the lobby level of the hotel. if you are looking to have a quick, inexpensive bite, there's a ramen shop that serves up big portions of delicious Tonkatsu ramen for 600-700 yen. From the hotel, go down to level 3, take pedestrian deck and walk down the stairs instead of walking towards to the big clock. Walk for about 100 meters and you will be able to see the shop diagonally to your right. It's still on the way to Shimbashi station and you will see it if you don't take the elevated way.","Singapore, Singapore","Mitters W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",32,5.0

Ate in the hotel's Japanese restaurant - excellent and inexpensive course menu. Fully booked on return trip so ate in their French restaurant. Good food, but more expensive and much quiter, lacking the atmosphere of the Japanese restaurant. Good breakfasts - both Japanese and European. I hope we'll come back to Tokyo.

Good, clean hotel, efficient, helpful staff. Convenient location for train access etc. We were offered a room upgrade on checking in, a Tower view room for 2000 Yen per night, which we took. So glad we did as we were treated to fabulous views of Mount Fuji on most of our 7 night stay. Lots of photos, sunrise, sunset and everything inbetween! The complimentary tea and coffee provided in the room were surprisingly good, although not too keen on powdered milk to go with it. Lots of good quality toiletries and other useful items in the bathroom, even a spare hairbrush! One criticism we would have is that the hotel bar is not a non-smoking area, something we did not realise until we were settled at the window with our drinks and a gentleman arrived and lit up a particularly strong smelling cigarette. Haven't downed a glass of wine so fast before! For the rest of our stay we bought a very reasonably priced bottle of wine from the convenience store in the basement each eveving and enjoyed it in our room, looking at the view. We had booked a room only deal so did not try the breakfast, however, there is a wonderful bakery down in the underground station walkway complex where we got fresh pastries and good coffee each morning, served by lovely, friendly ladies. On our last morning, laden with our suitcases and heading for the train to the airport we stopped by for our final breakfast. The serving lady popped out and came up to us as we were looking at the shelves and said that she recognised us from previous mornings and apologised that they did not have the pastries she had noticed that we usually took. We were very impressed with the service and quality of the food and coffee and would recommend it to anyone else (Bakery Kobeya, next to the ticket gates to the Asakua line entrance). Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Park Hotel and wouls definitely recommend it to anyone else.",United Kingdom,"jc30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United Kingdom</strong>",63,4.0

The Japanese very cleverly use some of these buildings for hotels and restaurants by employing the top floors and thus boasting wonderful views of Tokyo. The Park Hotel is one of the better attempts to apply this strategy. The lobby is on the 25th floor with rooms located on floors 26-34. Views are terrific with either Tokyo Tower or Mt. Fuji (on a very clear day) visible according to the room's location. The rooms themselves are comfortable and sufficiently roomy (though placed within the context of Tokyo). In the same way that one doesn't expect large hotel rooms in London and New York, only the overly optimistic or wealthy expect expansive rooms in Tokyo.Cleanliness and service is quite high as is expected at a Japanese hotel. Most of the staff seems to have either fairly good or even excellent English and will go out of their way to assist. The area in which the hotel is situated is sort of curious. As Gertrude Stein said of Oakland California, 'There is no there, there."" Meaning that you will not want to spend too much time in the immediate area although there are numerous restaurants ranging in price within a five minute walk so there is no necessity to travel. However both Ginza and the fish market are short walks away from the hotel. Another short walk will take you to Hama-rikyu Gardens which are well worth exploring. Moreover, the hotel are within short walks of a number of train and subway lines making the hotel an ideal starting point to explore Tokyo.From either airport the hotel can be reached directly by limousine bus. If you arrive or have to depart at times when the buses are not running the hotel is fairly easy to reach via the trains running from both airports. However some care needs to be taken when one arrives at the hotel's vicinity. The area is served by a maze of overpasses and subterranean routes. It is easy to become confused when traveling these routes with sign posting less than obvious. Be sure to get explicit directions from the hotel's website.I simply got a particularly good deal on my hotel room With value for money I was not expecting to be disappointed. But those expectations were more than met. This is definitely a hotel worth considering for any planned trip to Tokyo.","Sydney, Australia","cfreedma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",136,5.0

The hotel is well located within a business (towers) area, so there is restaurants and some shops in the bottom of the towers. Also the Shiodome have additional small shops. The hotel is within 2 minutes of subway and train stations. I used the JR Yamanote that is making a circle connecting the major quarters in Tokyo. Using a day pass (approx 8 dollars) to can reach key location easy without complications. Also this one is also in English so easier to understand with limited Japanese skills. Taxis are ok for the airport (Haneda) but a bit expensive, I think it's simple for arrival and departure but that's it, the train is excellent, I really liked the Yamanote. The personnel was very nice on my arrival on 15 December especially after a 13hrs flight from Canada. I had a corner room on the 29 floor and had a very nice view of the Sky three and building area with lights at night. The room was very spacious even in North American standards. Nice bed and everything very clean. The wireless internet was fast and TV had typical Japanese channels, interesting to look at a bit. The breakfast was too expensive for my taste and after one day I decided to buy some items at the 7eleven below the hotel and eat close to the main shops around train stations. There is also a little bakery at the bottom of the hotel but close on weekends. You are in walking distance to the Fish market, Tokyo tower, Ginza stores and a Zojoji temple. If you want to shop, I liked the Shimbashi, Yurakucha (close to Ginza and have movie theatre in case of a rainy day, subtitled. ) and the Akihabara. Shibuya could be nice, but not on weekend and evening as it's very crowded. Historic locations are a must; especially the Imperial Palace and different temples.","Ottawa, Canada","CdnTravelFan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",52,5.0

Took a taxi ride to Tokyo Station with our luggage for Y1000 which is about $10 CAD.Staff were attentive with a good grasp of English and more than happy to assist. We sent off our luggage to our hotel in Kyoto and the Park Hotel staff made it an easy and seamless experience. Check-in and check-out was a breeze (maybe I just missed the rush) but do expect the process to take a little longer than what we're used to in North America.The room itself was large in size by Japan standard and small to average by North American standard. We opted for the Premier king (two twins joined together) with a wonderful view of the Tokyo Tower and Mount Fuji in the morning. It was quite something waking up to the view of both in bed. Only downsides were the somewhat dirty carpet and the room had the smallest hint of cigarette smoke but not noticable after the first night.With so many places to explore in Tokyo, we didn't utilize any of the restaurants or lounges. For breakfast, we saved some money by heading down to the convenience store (Family Mart) at the basement level and picked up some food there instead. With Tsukiji being so close, you can also just head over there in the morning and pick up some food.All-in-all a wonderful stay at the Park Hotel and will likely return in the future.","Calgary, Canada","685josephl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",2,4.0

The hotel is located in the Shiodome where it is a complex of offices. It can be quiet in the evening but It is super convenient. Once you got your direction down, you can reach a lot of places through either underground or overpass.

The room showed a few signs of wear and tear but nothing substantial. The room was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. I was very happy to spend time in the room and get work done.One of the best parts of this hotel is the Thann Spa. I didn’t get a chance to get a massage or facial, but they stock Thann products, which I was happy to purchase!

It is one nice surprise after another. The Park Hotel Tokyo is now officially my official hotel in Tokyo.The positive first impressions start at the entrance to the building. The lobby of the hotel is not on the ground floor. It is on the 25th floor. The way to the lifts is through the bright, airy lobby of the Shiodome Media Tower in which there were 2 interesting exhibits: 1 on political cartoons, the other on the history-making events of the post war world as recorded by the cameras of the news agency housed in the tower. Both are fascinating. Several sensory surprises await you 25 floors up. I will not spoil them by describing them here. I'll just put it this way... It's a lobby one looks forward to spending time in. The staff is lovely and helpful. Most speak English well enough to be helpful. But, the main thing is the sincerity. During my 5 days there, I never encountered that politeness-as-a-duty behavior that I experienced in every other hotel in Japan. They must have some special recruiting technique to hire those who are helpful and polite just because they want to be. My room was one of the ""artist rooms"". Again, I will not ruin the surprise for you. I will just say that I smiled every time I entered the room. It was a joy just to sit there admiring the walls as well as the view of Tokyo from 31 floors above the action. Breakfast is quite good.

Fuji (which is usually an elusive presence). Rooms are medium-sized and have the usual 4-5 star hotel amenities: slippers, in-room coffee and tea, safe, mini-bar, sleeping kimono, free Wi-Fi. The bathroom is small but includes an all-service toilet that turns out to be standard in many Japanese facilities. Fortunately the buttons for flushing and more intimate cleansing activities are easily de-codable. There's a small but functional business center that meets basic needs (Macs, not PCs). Ground floor and basement of the building have a daytime café and a 24-hour mini-mart; the metro/train station complexes have many little shops selling food, clothing and other items. Compared to the coldly impersonal Conrad, Royal Park, Intercontinental (Roppongi) and Imperial Hotel lobbies we visited, the Park Hotel is warmly welcoming, almost cozy by Tokyo standards. Staff are very helpful, polite and gracious. Breakfast and light dinners in the lounge are very good, with a sufficient selection of western and Asian food. In fact, the croissants and Danish pastries are so yummy that I saw guests every morning standing by the bread baskets wolfing down the ones with chocolate chips without bothering to go to their tables. The two on-site restaurants - Tatero Yoshino (TY) Bis (fairly cutting edge French cuisine) and Hanasanshou (kaiseki-style Japanese) - are excellent. Food quality and presentation at both are worth the prices and if you're a Casablanca fan you'll be able to lipsync ""Play it Sam,"" with Ingrid Bergman and ""Here's looking at you kid,"" with Humphrey Bogart while the film plays silently on one of the walls in TY Bis.For touring, the hotel is well located right above the Shiodome Japan Rail station which goes directly to the Oeno circular city line that stops at Tokyo Station; an easy walk through the sky-scraper complex of Shiodome takes you to Shimbashi station where multiple metro and private train lines connect. You could walk to the Tsukiji Fish market for the early morning tuna auction (hotel recommends leaving at 4:00 am to get one of the 120 spots available to tourist viewing) or skip the auction, wait until the metro starts running and ride up to the market's entrance, one stop away. Worthwhile visit, by the way, to see what it takes to put that piece of sashimi or sushi on your plate.For visitors who take Sunrise Tours of Mt. Fuji and other places, the good news is that the company picks you up at the hotel. The airport bus does too. Driving may be a bit of a challenge because we did have one or two cab drivers who needed to resort to their GPS to find the hotel entrance.

We stayed in room 2901 - Corner King with Tokyo Tower and Skyline view. Honestly, I think this was the least exciting corner king room they had available and was not as glamourous looking as the photos on the website. If you're going to stay here and get a corner king, get one on the other side of the hotel. I think the skyline on that side is ""better"" and more ""glamourous"".Let's start with the PROs:Breathtaking views of the Tokyo skyline, including Tokyo TowerConveniently located right by three (3!!!) train stations - Shimbashi, Shiodome, and YurikamomeSurprisingly delish candy dish in the lobbyGorgeous lobbySpacious room (well, by Japanese standards)For the most part, the staff were super friendly - exactly what you'd expect from a property that bills itself as a ""luxury hotel""Free Wifi that worked GREAT!!CONs:The guy who checked us in did not represent the hotel well or display typical Japanese hospitality. He seemed genuinely disengaged. I know this probably seems trivial and had we been at an American hotel, I would have been like ""whatever"" about it, but that's cause service in America sucks compared to Japan...so basically, I expected more.We had a room with million dollar views, but unfortunately, the room itself did not reflect that. It's outdated and the carpet along the wall with the windows were torn up and the caulking around the bathtub (top) was not done properly. Again, little details, but when you're paying a premium, you notice those things.The hallways smell of an ""old"" hotel...basically, all I kept thinking was ""this is an outdated hotel with an updated facade and lobby"". I'm sure their suites are much nicer than the room I stayed in, but given that we were in an upgraded room, I can't imagine the hotel has THAT many ""fancy, schmancy"" rooms...does that make sense?So, in conclusion -- while the over all stay wasn't horrible, it is not worth the $300+ price tag to have a ""room with a view"" when the rooms are outdated and you can get equally delicious views and a more updated room in an EVEN MORE conveniently located area (like Shibuya or Shinjuku) for about $50 more (average)...like at the Cerulean Tokyu Tower.","Washington, District of Columbia, United States","Haley G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, District of Columbia, United States</strong>",19,3.0

So we thought that location was everything. When we looked at prices and reviews, we thought this hotel looked good value. Then we realised that the rooms start on the 25th floor with some amazing views.We paid extra for a Tokyo Tower facing corner room (about £40/$60 a night more?) and it was worth it. We were on the 33rd floor and every time we went back to the room, we just went ""wow"". The room was spacious with an enormous (king+) bed plus four wall to ceiling windows. Smart bathroom, safe and mini-bar (why?). All very good.We had the buffet breakfast once - it was pretty good, lots of variety and a relaxed atmosphere.The only downside is actually the location. Despite it being on top of one subway line and only 5 minutes from about three others, it really means that you have to work out the complicated subway system to get anywhere. Once we'd worked out the Suica card system (touch-in / out, e-card) cost between £1-2 ($2-3) and location was ok. The biggest problem we had was our last evening in the Ginza area (just on the edge of the hotel) which is clearly a business district. We found it hard to find a restaurant - lots there but full of business people and quite a lot of them are on the 4/5/6th floors making it hard to choose one without having to go into a lift etc etc.Overall, a lovely hotel and we would definitely re-visit and recommend","Aylesbury, United Kingdom","paul_michele_smith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aylesbury, United Kingdom</strong>",62,4.0

For breakfast you can choose between Japanese food and the normal croissant / bread. I think that the breakfast is where you can see that this is a 4 start hotel and not a 5 start, it's a bit poor, but I think it has more to do with the space available.

It was pretty easy to find from the station (once we'd realise we weren't booked into another Park Hotel practically next door! The Media tower where its located is pretty impressive, and the reception is on the 25th floor, so all rooms have a pretty spectacular view. It was great to see the Shinkansen travelling through Shimbashi station which runs practically under the hotel, at all times of day and night. The hotel was silent though- no noise from anywhere, except the odd rumble of thunder from an overhead thunderstorm! Amazing to watch the frequent lightening strikes from our window. If views are your thing, the reception has pretty cool view of the Tokyo Tower and we did see Mount Fuji to the right of it in the haze.There were lots of pluses and a few minuses to this hotel. Room was great, as was the reception service. In particular we needed to forward our luggage to a hotel Hiroshima- 3 huge cases- and this was done with no fuss for an amazing 12 pounds or so. Breakfast was pretty good, though can get busy and we ended up in a side room, which obviously hadn't been cleaned from dinners the night before- table clothes were grubby for example. Staff in the breakfast /bar area a bit miserable- and getting service for a drink in the early evening was a bit tricky. Happy hour drinks were pretty good value- about 800 yen for big beer. Drinks prices later in the evening were astronomical- but it is a hotel after all. Don't even ask what two single G&Ts cost. If you're loaded you could even try the dozens and dozens of whiskeys on offer- not surprisingly few people did so the late night bar was quiet.We liked the Park Hotel and wished we could have stayed longer.","Newcastle, United Kingdom","JGlass_11</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newcastle, United Kingdom</strong>",14,4.0

The Tower View room was very nice with a great view especially at night, although for some reason the Tower lights turned off at 22:00 and came back on at 22:30. The rooms although small were kept clean and tidy and had all the necessary amenities one might require. The only minor point in the room was that there were no complimentary water bottles.Breakfast at the hotel was satisfactory. The selection was ok for Western and Asian tastes however on hindsight I feel that possibly having breakfast in one of the cafes outside might have been cheaper and better quality. The biggest problem at breakfast was the lack of staff cleaning the tables, meaning dirty plates were left for over 10 minutes on people's tables, whilst the senior staff stood at the entrance to Breakfast looking at their watches. One thing I was not happy about was eating breakfast in the hotel lobby/atrium as whilst eating, many people would walk in and out of the hotel. Also, there was no view of the city which is one of the biggest selling points of the hotel!!The hotel's location above Shiodome Station and under a 10 minute walk from Shimbashi station makes it an ideal base for touring Tokyo as a tourist or for Business.","London, United Kingdom","griggstraveller1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",40,4.0

From the station it was a 1400 Yen (EUR 10/USD 14) taxi ride to the hotel. Because the entrance is not that prominent because the lobby of the hotel is on the 25th floor and the area around the hotel has a lot of corridors, we found it money well spent to have a taxi take us from the station to the entrance of the hotel.Check-in went smooth and although a lot of hotels in Japan have a strict policy about check-in times, the Park hotel was really accommodating even when we arrived rather early. The front desk was also helpful with tips about getting around the city. We had a triple room which was exceptionally spacious for Tokyo/Japanese standards. View over the city was nice. Room was clean and although design was a little bland, the room was good. Wifi was ok.We didn't have breakfast in the hotel but at Felt's on the basement floor of the Shiodome City Center building, enter the building from the outside left from the cooking studios. (In previous reviews reference was made to Vie de France, but we have not been able to find it and think it is possible that is has been taken over by Felt's). Breakfast at this bakery was delicious with fine croissants, pastries and bread,The best thing about the park hotel is the location. Within walking distance are Tsukiji fishmarket (10-15 minutes) and Ginza (15-20 minutes). Ask the front desk for directions.Furthermore It is is a 7 minute walk to the Shimbashi train station which is only a few minutes by local train away from two major Shinkansen stations in Tokyo, Tokyo station (for north bound Shinkansen trains) and Shinagawa station (for south bound Shinkansen trains). This station is also on the Yamamoto circular line which brings you in around 20 25 minutes to Shibuya and Shinjuku. Besides that both the Shiodome subway station (at the entrance of the hotel) and the Shimbashi subway station provide easy access to the major sightseeing points in town. It takes a little getting used to to get around the hotel because there are walkways on different levels. However, when you get used to it, it is really not that hard.To summarize it: this is a good quality hotel but what would make us return is the excellent location close to many transport options which makes it easy to get around Tokyo and beyond Tokyo.","Almere, The Netherlands","TripleDutch</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Almere, The Netherlands</strong>",236,4.0

Also, it is next to NTV tower and Shiodome station, and 5mins away from Shimbashi Station (linked by underpass and overpass).

For those who are not too adventurous when it comes to food, there is Subway and Mcdonalds nearby at Caretta Shiodome and Shiodome station. There's a Family Mart at the basement of the hotel building too. One thing that they could probably improve on is the aircon... it took very long for my room to become cool.

There is a metro station in the basement and a JR station 5 minutes walk away at Shimbashi so it's very easy to travel anywhere in the city that you'd like to go. The Limousine bus also stops here. Many reasonably priced restaurants in the several shopping complexes that are in the downstairs Shiodome area. Good for anyone that wants a top quality hotel close to the sights but a little removed from the crowds of places like Shinjuku.

I have struggled with the choice of staying at the ubiquitous 'mainline' hotels (Hilton, Starwood, etc) with their 'predictable' but western-friendly environment, vs. staying 'local' at a more traditional Japanese hotel (where I sometimes miss the usual 'amenities' like the 'Western breakfast'. There is only so much Miso soup I can handle at 7AM) and the occasional communication challenges with the front desk. The Park Hotel seems to have positioned itself very nicely with the best of both. For example, the staff is extraordinarily pleasant yet not confused when you 'wave off' the bell desk staff at check-in , indicating that you are fine with taking your luggage with you, on your own, to the room. The rooms are 'large' for Tokyo standards, the bathroom amenities are plentiful and of high quality, and there are actually face cloths (which is often not the case in Japan). Beds are really comfortable with a selection of pillows. Coffee and tea in the room. No mini-bar, but excellent restaurant choices (French and Japanese) on the lobby level. One of the restaurants has a fantastic selection of Scotch Whiskeys. Speaking of - the lobby is on the 25th floor with spectacular views of Tokyo Tower and (on the clear days) all the way to Mt Fuji.Location is fantastic, with easy walking underground to Shimbashi Station. There are certainly more expensive options in Tokyo, but for the price - this hotel can't be beat.

Since we didn't look into lodging earlier, we missed many of the promotion deals for many hotels. The rate for this hotel was not inexpensive but we felt we got what we paid for.We're somewhat familiar with the small room size in major cities and not many hotels have rooms for a family of 4 (including two kids aged 11 & 13). This hotel has a room that allows 3 adults and 1 kid (11 and under). The room was quite spacious and well appointed including the bathroom for a big city. With our luggage and family size, we didn't feel cramped and we're able to comfortably move around. With the jet lag, we spent many hours being awake in the room too.Location - it is attached to a few plazas like office buildings and one - with also restaurants, convenient store, coffee shops and retail stores. Close and safe enough for our kids to go there to grab a snack or drink. The best part is that it's very close to the Fish Market - Tsukiji. It opens early enough for our jetlagged state to go check it out. We did miss the 4 am 'fish auction'. However, the market was bustling at about 4 or 5 am. Little stalls and stands were open including food and souvenirs when we walked there at 5. A few of the well known sushi restaurants (they're tiny - almost like diners) have lines already starting before the day breaks. Some lines take a few hours. We went to one of the diners at the last day 5 am ... we didn't go to the 'famous' ones as we didn't want to stand in lines but it was still amazing! The one we went to were like many with a counter seating about a dozen. After you placed the order, you watched the chef preparing your bowls. Beside Tsukiji, it's also about 20 min walk to Ginza. It is also at a subway stop. We used public transportation only while we were there. The system was not as easily navigated as other systems so if it is new, take the time to figure it out. Atmosphere - the hotel started on 25th floor. It sounded strange but once you arrived there, it seemed quite 'normal'. The lobby was quite trendy and modern and open. They had a buffet there that looked delicious. However, we decided to try out all the local foods instead. Staff - very courteous, polite and friendly. At the last day of check out, we left our luggage behind as our flight was in the evening. When we went to pick up our luggage, the staff told us we left a few belongings behind (and they were quite important). Thanks to the honesty of the staff, nothing was missing. Travel to/from airport - there is a shuttle that conveniently takes you from the airport to the hotel at a very reasonable cost. It is very comfortable, clean, air conditioned, not like some of the airport shuttles in US. Much cheaper than a cab. The hotel will book the shuttle for you as requested on the way out. We at first wanted to stay in Shinjuku. We're happy to stay here instead as it was a bit more quiet. If you look for a night life, this may not be the best location. For us, it has worked out quite well.","Washington, DC","bolityzo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington, DC</strong>",41,5.0

The view of the Tokyo tower was almost perfect, minus the season which limits the view of Mt Fuji. Good location with lots of subways and train stations surrounding it.

Lots of Izakaya to explore over at Shimbashi Station and they are friendly to foreigner too. Some even have English menu! Great view, great location.

(8,9 & 10 June, 2014)Hotel is difficult to find if you come via subway. Getting off at Shimbashi Subway station and trying to find any signs that point to the hotel is difficult. Follow the signs towards Shio Dome and keep your eyes open for two small signs that point to Park Hotel. It's a long walk underground through the mostly deserted subway, up and down escalators and stairs, to the basement entrance which is a revolving door which takes you into what appears to be a tradesman's area, a narrow underground corridor where you eventually find a door marked ""Park Hotel"" Take the single lift to the 25th Floor to reception. It should be much better sign posted.If you want a room ""With a view"" be prepared to pay extra and if the cloud lifts you may get to see Mt Fuji in the distance. (Unfortunately it was cloud covered for our 3 nights).Rooms are well appointed, clean and comfortable, however when the room was made up during the day staff failed to remove 3 empty soap, shampoo & conditioner containers from the bathroom, even though they placed new ones on the vanity unit.The buffet breakfast, both western and Japanese style was okay but it appears even here they cant get a toaster which actually works. (2 domestic toasters & 1 domestic pie warmer type oven, multiple guests still having problems getting bread to toast).The main restaurant has a ""Guests Only Casual Dinner"" which was a multi course Japanese meal and was reasonable value for money, but book early. We arrived at 6 pm and couldn't get a table till 8 pm.Overall, despite these couple of minor issues the hotel is well located and staff were helpful and courteous. These minor issues, however, prevent a higher rating.I would stay there again.","Melbourne, Australia","DavidMMc56</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",90,4.0

First of all, I have to say that we were blown away by Japanese customer service. Everyone there was showed a level of kindness and professionalism that I rarely see in American hotels. With that said, here are the pros and cons:PROS:-Great view. We paid for the Tokyo Tower view and it didn't disappoint. It was a great way to wake up in the morning, and a fantastic thing to see before going to bed.-Easy access to the Tokyo subway. It's right off the Oedo line at the Shiodome station and a block or two from Shimbashi station, so it was easy to navigate the city from one of those stops.-Convenient to the Tsukiji fish market and Hamarikyu Gardens. The gardens were a nice break, especially when the Tokyo humidity got to be too much.-Nice breakfast. With the hotel discount, the breakfast came to 22 yen/person. A nice mix of western breakfast items (scrambled eggs, bacon and sausage, croissants) with traditional Japanese food like miso soup, noodles and fish.CONS:-No English language TV. They had CNN and the BBC, but both stations were dubbed in Japanese. It would have been nice to have at least one station in English.-A little too far away from Shinjuku and Shibuya. The Tokyo subway system basically shuts down at 12:30 am, so if you're planning a late dinner, and want to check out some Tokyo nightlife, then you'll have to cab it back to the hotel. We did that a couple of times and from Shinjuku, a cab ride was about 50 yen. Also, even with the directions provided by the hotel, the cab drivers could never find the hotel. We were taken to the Park Hyatt at one point. -The hotel did have kind of a weird smell of smoke. We noticed it when we first arrived and didn't later on in the trip. Which makes me think we just got used to it.When we go back to Tokyo, we'll probably stay closer to the Shinjuku/Shibuya area. But this was a decent hotel for the price.","Los Angeles, CA","Whatsinanayme</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",19,4.0

That was the selling point for me, room rate booked directly from hotel webpage was 19200 yen/night (first night was more expensive and second cheaper but this was average of two nights) standard room for 4 people with baby cot :)Breakfast was not included and we bought it separetly at the hotel. I remember the price was about 2500 jen/person, and our age children were free. Of course you can get much cheaper and same level breakfast from the street cafes if you want to save some money.Room was quite small which I guess is normal in Tokyo, enough for 4 people no problems. Very nice view from 32nd floor to the Tokyo Bay. Room had all the armenities one needs and beds were very good to sleep on at least in our taste.

It's very easy to travel by train to and from the hotel and there are plenty of taxis too.The hotel feels luxurious and more boutique than business - it is cosy and fellow guests all appeared to be well-dressed - lots of hushed tones and good manners! We were aware of our noisy children but nobody ever made us feel out of place. The staff brought teddies and treats up to our room and made us feel welcome.We stayed in a triple room which was definitely big enough for the 4 of us (3 beds and 1 cot) plus our luggage and pushchair. The bathroom is small but has everything you need with powerful water and a heated toilet seat. The views from the rooms are fantastic - Tokyo Tower on one side and Skytree on the other. We slept very well and never heard another guest.The food is high end so we only ate breakfast at the hotel, and had lunch and dinner when we were out. The room service menu isn't extensive but you can get something if you're desperate. In the local City Centre tower and also just along the walkway towards Shimbashi there are lots of local cafés plus more international coffee shops for informal food. In 15 minutes you can walk to Ginza for good restaurants too.My only gripe is the sometimes snooty staff at breakfast who were happy to stand back and watch while we made countless trips to the breakfast buffet to get glasses of water and all the food required for a family of four for breakfast, particularly on one occasion when we arrived just before they were closing. But that seems to be the style of this hotel, and timings in Japan seem to run like clockwork.We would stay here again and recommend this hotel.",Dubai,"Claire_Cooke</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai</strong>",38,5.0

As we'd come to expect in Japan the hotel staff we extremely courteous and throughout our stay the service was impeccable.The hotel is well placed being close to a number of rail and metro stations all accessible via the underground walkways so it's relatively easy to get to other parts of the city. The hotel is within easy walking distance of Ginza too which was worth a visit for the great shops.At the reception level there are two restaurants; one French and one Japanese although we didn't eat in either. We did eat in the lounge area though and the food was fine. A very tasty wagyu beef stew is to be recommended.There are innumerable restaurants close to the hotel but I feel they're more intended towards feeding locals rather than visitors and that is fair enough; it's their city. I does mean that unless you can read Japanese then you have no idea what you're ordering which made it exciting! Even the pictures that a few of the restaurants had on their menus didn't really help. However we enjoyed our food, whatever it might have been, on the two evenings we were there.The view of the Tokyo tower from the bedroom in the evening was a real treat and we could just have gazed out over that cityscape forever. You might think that one high rise city skyline is much like another but they each has its uniqueness in my view.The room was perfectly adequate in size and the bed very comfortable (a relief for my wife who didn't get on too well with the hard beds in Hakuba).I would without a second thought stay at the Park hotel again if I ever go back to that wonderful city.","Jackson, Wyoming","Chris989898</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jackson, Wyoming</strong>",71,5.0

It's centrally located, with subway and lightrail stations within walking distance. They have very interesting exhibitions at the lobby (AWARE: it's not on the ground floor. Read the instructions on the lift) and apparently every now and then they would project some short films onto their giant white wall for ones to watch. The room was rather spacious, and the view was very good; we could see the Tokyo Tower from our room. However, there are two thing that you need to be aware of (nothing about the hotel facility tho):1. Unless you are on a business trip that requires you to stay near Ginza, this area may not be a bit boring for it's kinda far away from all the fun places. Except that there is a giant clock opposite the road (on your way to the subway station) influenced by Howl's Moving Castle which chimes every now and then. It's definitely worth checking out if you are nearby. 2. I find that many luxury hotels in Tokyo have a distinctive feature: they occupy only the top floors of high-rises. This can for sure provide you a good view, however for one that can't stand a rapid lift due to the air compression like me or one with claustrophobia, it may not be an enjoyable experience.

Not much wardrobe space and a desk that is also a TV stand. The internet is super fast but there aren't any English TV channels and only limited to less than 10 channels. Where are the standard international channels?The hotel is very much on top of a subway line, a monorail and a short 5 minutes walk from the JR station which has many connections. So as far as getting around, it is convenient, but that said, there really isn't that much around. It is all office buildings in the immediate area, hardly any pedestrians once it gets dark and many restaurants don't open on the weekends. So if you want a quick proper meal late at night, you will have to go to Shimbashi station.The hotel has a shuttle going to and from both Narita and Haneda airport, check the times on the hotel website.Another thing I liked about the hotel is that it does have coin operated laundry for those on a budget. This can be very useful for those travelling more than a week.I was happy with the hotel given the price we paid and it was a very good hotel, but for holiday, you will want to be a bit closer to the action, e.g. Shibuya, Shinjuku or Ebisu, for you to really feel like you are in Tokyo.","Singapore, Singapore","David S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",100,4.0

Nothing too particular about the interior or rooms, staff was helpful but not especially so, breakfast was simple but enough, everything worked as things should. We stayed in both queen double and king size corner room (4 nights total). The corner room had much better view and I think it is worth its higher price. Convenience store downstairs and easy access to subway/trains are really good. Did not try the tiny gym or spa facilities. Bathrooms come without proper air flow and don't have real tiling (bit of a plastic feel overall), composite materials instead of solid wood used in interior. It was slightly difficult to manage a comfortable temperature given the cold weather outside (small room was either too hot or too cold, the bigger room was easier to control).

Very important, Don't take a taxi from Narita airport to the hotel. It was a very expensive lesson and next time we are definitely taking the airport shuttle. JR (Japan Rail) and subway would be too inconvenient with five pieces of luggage. If you are arriving or leaving from Haneda airport than taxi would be doable. Front entrance of building is not the entrance of hotel but the entrance to the Shiodome Media business Tower. You must go through the revolving doors to get to the elevators which will take you up to the hotel lobby on the 25th floor. Don't expect any hotel staff to help you upon arriving at the tower entrance but once you're in the lobby staff are quick to help with your bags and take you to front desk. As other reviewers mentioned, staff are helpful and friendly but not very personable. They are more than happy to help with any questions or issues but won't go out of their way to assist. Rooms are small for American standards but average to large in Japan. Our queen tower view room was much roomier than the double at the Washinton Hotel I've stayed in ten years ago. The view from our room was as advertised. We were lucky to have good weather during our stay and could see snow capped Mt.Fuji during the day. Tokyo night lights were stunning as well. Location couldn't be beat. There were subway, metro, and JR all within the 3rd floor walkway or escalator to B2 away. If possible opt for subway, TOIE or Tokyo Metro, easier to understand imo. Going to Disneyland takes two TOIE transfers and a JR to resort entrance. The concierge will gladly show you on the subway map. Near the Shiodome building are many local eateries and drinking establishments as well as western chains and pubs. Hotel has a nice dining area for breakfast which we tried on day of check-out. Average to expensive for what they offered but convenient if you're short on time. Checking out was quick and staff are very efficient with bags and had a taxi ready for us at building entrance. Tipping are not required and some will even refuse politely. We left gratuity for housekeeping the day we left so they couldn't refuse. Hotel has everything you would need but not over the top. Great for business travelers. Between average to above average but everyone's standards are different. My s/o gives it very good to excellent.","La Palma, California","happyme899</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>La Palma, California</strong>",27,4.0

Prepare for a little bit of a walk, especially challenging if you have many heavy suitcases. Another minor quibble: our room had a very slight body odor smell, but the room had a deodorizing fabric spray that helped.If traveling solely by public transit, this location is likely more suitable for those who can do a lot of walking, though that may be the case for Tokyo in general.

And except the manager, the reception staff who served me is really poor in English. The most annoying point is, he didn;t understand what I'm asking for, but keep nodding his head and repeating his own words no matter what I said, until his manager came and talked properly in English to communicate with me. And the luggage arrangement is also not considerable compare to Ritz Carlton Seoul I stayed later.Um. everything ask for extra charge(seafood price however, really disappointed..first staff told me better view cost 1000Yen, another told me 2000yen..N i told him I asked it before..then he amended).. for the window view..to the room arrangement (orignally said I need to move my room a few days after my stay to make me have a good view , plus I need to extra pay..though finally didn;t happen)..Anyway, I won'y come back again.

This hotel is conveniently located in the shiodome neighborhood which is rather quiet but is virtually a 10-15 minute walk to Ginza.This time I flew into Haneda airport which was superbly convenient to travel into Tokyo compared with Narita.If you do fly into Haneda international airport take the Monorail and wait for the Haneda express which will cost you 470 yen ( about USD 5 ) and take it to the final one stop to Hamamatsucho station. Then get a taxi to the hotel, which is literarily 5 mins away and cost about 710 yen. So convenient, fast and cheap.Now back to the hotel, the rooms are comfortable if not on the smallish side, my partner and I still find it cosy nevertheless. The amenities are abundant and I have to say the bed is extremely comfortable and the rooms are quiet.Breakfast is served everyday at 7am, you may choose to purchase this as a package when booking your room or choose to add that to your bill. Breakfast is a huge array of continental and Asian fare, and will cost you around USD 52 for 2 persons, not cheap but if you eat a hearty breakfast you may choose to have a snack for lunch.

It is walking distance to some attractions and multiple metro lines and the JR rail system -= it is only 2/3 metro stops to many things. Don't expect a posh 5 star lobby or room and the beds are hard (like most Japanese beds we found) and room on the small side (we had a twin bed as was told this was bigger than a double and the hotel was full at the time so we could not upgrade), however you are not paying 5 star prices either. (On this same trip we spent our last 2 nights in the Hilton Tokyo and paid more for more inconvenience and expense in every way and would go back to the Park over the Hilton). The inhouse Japanese restaurant was very good and reasonable price (approx $130 for a set course menu of 4/5 dishes and a bottle of wine) although there are plenty of restaurants in the Shiodome area both at skyscraper heights and in the extensive underground or office complex areas. We did not have a bad meal on any night (it would be preferable if you like Japanese food), all served wine and the choice was extensive - usual cost was approx $70ish. We ate out for breakfast at Starbucks or other breakfast establishments again all around the Shiodome/Carretta area (although did get a free breakfast for 2 because we stayed 6 nights and joined the Park Hotel club (for free) - thank you to a Tripadvisor tip off before we left - this buffet was very good with a view over the gardens which was pleasant. The only downside for us (which was not a problem but could be for others was our room was on the 26th floor overlooking the train station which made for interesting viewing but there was a slight train noise for all but a few hours in the middle of the night. A major plus was a DYI inhouse laundry (Y200 per load including washing powder) which meant no bathroom washing - which for me puts a damper on my holiday. The concierge was excellent with help to get around, booked our bus trip to Shirakawago which could not be booked until we were in country and provided great maps and the 10 top sights to see (how best to get there, how much on the metro, etc). A transport tip for travellers arriving in Tokyo late (that is around 8pm when the Jetstar flight comes in from Cairns) the direct Park Hotel airport limo bus has stopped so you need to catch the bus to Tokyo Central Station and then a taxi which was not a problem but not expected. As for arriving at this hotel for the first time by train with luggage, I think this would be fairly challenging to find the hotel entrance which although clearly marked needs a bit of experience to negotiate your way through the subway alleys and know how the signage ""thinks"" and the walk is approximately 1km. Another great plus was a Familymart (aka 7/11) in the basement of the hotel with plenty of choice for snacks, drinks, sushi, sandwiches, toilettry necessities, etc , Chilean wine ($7/bottle and excellent), beer (Japanese and imported - $3 per can).",Melbourne,"Myclare</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne</strong>",257,4.0

Hotel rooms are high enough (levels 25 and up) that no street-noise will wake you up at wee hours. Breakfast is rich and diverse. This is where the good part ends. There is a gym. postage-stamp sized, and locked at all times. In theory if you make a reservation ( for one hour only) you room key should open the gym door when time comes.

But the (quite small) room itself had a slightly tired feel, the arms of the chair being grubby and one or two marks were on the carpet. Much the same can be said for the lobby area. Some train noise can be heard. The view was great.But the service was poor. We wanted a drink after a long journey, but no-one noticed us come to sit in the lobby area and ask us what we would like, and after 10 minutes I got up and walked to the pay-desk and asked if anyone was actually serving. In that time we watched the waiters chatting together but not actually serving anyone.And then the whole process was repeated around 9.30pm. We wanted a drink and, yet again, no-one saw us and, again, I went to ask if anyone was actually serving. Only then did we get our drink.The only (quite small) restaurant was booked-up and this reveals the greatest weakness-it's a long walk through the maze of tunnels and walkways until you find a restaurant, and then they are mediocre railway-station-type places, some of which did not open in the evenings. Failing this it's the (very) expensive restaurants high in the nearby tower blocks or a metro journey to find better quality establishments. The hotel desperately needs another all day restaurant without leaving the building, such as in Sheraton Hiroshima.However, in its favour, one member of staff needs great praise. On receiving our luggage from the courier, we found a lock to have been broken and the case part-open. With a flight to the UK first thing next morning, buying a replacement at that time in the evening or next morning was out of the question. At first fazed by my request for help, the night manager, with little English, was only concerned about how it got broken. But then, as we began to panic about the possibility of loading a broken suitcase on to an aircraft, he sent one of his staff out into the night to buy some straps. When the fellow returned, he had two very strong suitcase straps with number code locks. The night-manager would accept no payment, 2000yen each (around £25 total) and was only concerned that they would be up to the job of securing the case, which they did admirably. I can only thank him most sincerely.","Congleton, United Kingdom","Liathach2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Congleton, United Kingdom</strong>",58,4.0

Great service, location is the best- has the metro station literally next door, walking distance to several parks and fish market, mall next door with breakfast options and relatively large rooms for Tokyo standards with amazing views!

The hotel was excellent, the room was exactly as advertised, queen bed with a view of the Tokyo Tower. As others have mentioned the rooms are on the small size which is typical of Japan, but they were very well appointed and comfortable. The staff were excellent, they looked after our luggage while we went to Kyoto on a tour and when we returned they had already taken the luggage up to our new room.The hotel is in easy walking distance of the Tsukji Fish Market and the Hama Rikyu Gardens and as much shopping as you can manage, if you are into that kind of thing, we aren't, but if you get the chance take the self paced audio tour of the Hama Rikyu Gardens,, it is really beautiful and completely restful, right in the center of Tokyo and it is free. Highly recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again.",,Terry-and-Dot,62,5.0

Location - Right above Shiodome station and walkable to Shimbashi, both have direct lines to almost everything you might want to visit. A bit far from Shinjuku and Shibuya, but great for visiting Ginza, Tsukiji and close enough to Roppongi.Room - Definitely small, but this was expected. The bed was comfortable and the view (that we had) was insanely good. We arrived at night and i spent the first 30 minutes just staring out the window. I imagine the views from any room are good considering it starts on the 25th floor.Price - Got the multi-day discount and saved >$200/day compared to other hotels. This was the biggest draw and still got a great hotel.Service - Phenomenal. I had a number of requests on calling places for reservations, getting Giants tickets, getting tickets to shows, etc., and the staff were always very enthusiastic to help out, which I appreciated. Will definitely stay here again when we're back in town.","San Francisco, California","Tenveux</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",35,5.0

The hotel is designed for more of a business traveler and not particularly for a family or group of college guys (which was my case). Nevertheless, the concierge was tremendously helpful in planning our tour and journey around Tokyo. He directed us to interesting (age appropriate) destinations around the city, was fluent in both English (as he was originally from the UK) and Japanese and even helped me translate medication that I purchased for my traveler’s stomach. He also pointed us towards the interesting clubs in Roppongi and told us to avoid certain areas as they were notorious for haggling tourists. Since the hotel is located in a business area (surrounded by office buildings), many of the restaurants around are more of the mall restaurants you would find in the US. It is not the ideal Japanese experience I was looking for however, there was an abundant selection of places to eat within 2 min walking distance. We used the subway for most of our day travels and our journeys (which were long an extensive) cost no more than $10/day. We used the taxis to travel around at night (especially to the Roppongi area) and they cost around $20-30 for a one way journey. We had breakfast twice at the hotel. The breakfast provided at Park Tokyo was two steps higher than a continental breakfast yet it cost around $20/person. We were shocked at how expensive the breakfast was but came to realize later on that it was worth the price due to the convenience and the fact that it was all you can eat, helping us to skip on a meal or two in between. The best part by far: the breathtaking views of Tokyo! Upon arriving and seeing the view from the reception desk at the Lobby, we decided to upgrade to a room with the view of the Tokyo tower and I must say, it was the best thing about the room (apart from the great bathrooms and the beds). This hotel was fully worth every dime we spent.","Los Angeles, California","Kesara0110</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",2,5.0

Had a great view of the city, which was spectacular at night. The hotel is comparable to a Hilton in the US, but keep in mind our space standards are a bit different than what I found in hotels in Japan. The room is small and the bathroom very small, but it was clean and for the most part comfortable. I found the beds in Japan to be a lot firmer than in the US, but that could be just me. The lobby was modern and the check-in very easy. Behind the front desk is a great panoramic view of the city. Access to the subway was pretty good from the hotel which made it very convenient to get around. The hotel lobby is on the 25th floor which means that you take a elevator to the lobby and then separate hotel to the floors with the rooms. Breakfast was not included in our room (was in the ANA Intercontinental that we stayed at earlier in the week), but our friends tried it and said it wasn't so great. There are other breakfast places nearby (Momi & Toys Creperie, Starbucks, Tullys, etc.) so we were covered. (Although the best breakfast is a sushi breakfast at the fish market.) As others said, smoking is permitted in the lobby which can be unpleasant when you first walk in. Overall, a good stay and would stay there again.","Salt Lake City, Utah","MDiddy605</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>",9,4.0

Room is too small for 2 adults and one kid, and the room is rather basic, in particular the bathroom which would definitely need a refreshment. Location is very good at cross roads of many subway and jr lines, lots of places to eat near shinbashi station also. Service was overall good.

Thanks to TA I found that only Park Hotel's own website offers this special deal. There were no double rooms available but I gambled hoping to get a double at check-in. This turned out to be a smart move because I ended up getting a double room on the top floor with Tokyo tower view!Room: 5/5The view towards the Tokyo tower is just awesome and you can even see Fujisan on a clear day. You also get a good view of Shinkansens running below your feet! They have a bay window with a comfy cushion so you can read/chill out feeling you are on top of Tokyo. The room is spacious by Tokyo standard and the bed is very comfortable. The Wifi connection is fantastic and it's quick and easy to hook up. Everything is nicely laid out and really there's nothing much to complain about. Service: 5/5We wanted to check in some large suitcases a couple of days before check-in date and the hotel duly obliged. In fact they moved them into our rooms before we even arrived. What's more impressive is that we requested a switch from twin to a double room. They told us all the rooms that were available and we ended up trying 2 of the Double room with Tokyo view. We were told these are smoking rooms but they don't smell and suggested we check them out. They are right, the only thing that smells was the corridor, so if you can get past that the room is perfectly fine. They moved our suitcases from the initial room and I just had to tip the guy for their entire service.Convenience 4.5/5The hotel actually sits 1 min walk from Shiodome metro/monorail and 7min walk to Shimbashi metro/JR. The 7min walk is pretty painless as it has a very busy underpass that is fully sheltered with aircon. These stations gives you direct/short journeys to most places in Tokyo and even places further out such as Narita Airport, Gotemba (Outlet mall) and Kamakura/Yokohama. Most tourists will find this hotel a perfect base to explore all parts of Tokyo without the noise in the heart of Tokyo. Japan's google transit is awesome and accurate to the minute for trains/metro. So use that to guage whether this is the right area for you. You got a convenience store at basement level and plenty of local restaurants/shops at Shimbashi station. In fact you can reach the heart of Ginza or Tsukiji Fish Market in less than 20min on foot! (save taxi money if you are going for the tuna auction)Value 5/5With the 40% deal you are looking at around 16000yen for a double room (+2000 for Tower View). In my opinion this is a real steal for such a modern luxurious hotel strategically located near Shimbashi. Can't comment too much on facilities but if you are looking for a bit of luxury in an excellent location without breaking the bank then this is your winner.","London, United Kingdom","hybrid713</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",20,5.0
