The executive lounge however looked like it was from the 50's. The food was poor. Unimaginative, repetitive and low quality. This is not what I expect from a Marriott property. I am a staunch Marriott supporter, but this one should be rebranded. It is a disservice to Marriott frequent travelers. BTW, it is really an out of the way location unless you need to be in Shinagawa. ","Damascus, Pennsylvania","NicoEvan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Damascus, Pennsylvania</strong>",16,3.0

I have stayed in a few hotels in the Shinagawa area and this hotel in my view is up there with the best of them! Excellent service from all that work at the hotel.The executive room is one of the best I have been in, well laid out and friendly service.The station is a small walk away, but hardly worth taking the free shuttle bus or even getting a taxi. Okay I may have dropped lucky with no rain but it’s a pleasant 10 minute walk away.Excellent grounds to walk around with waterfalls for relaxation.Overall I recommend this hotel when staying in Tokyo.","Leeds, United Kingdom","alinumber7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leeds, United Kingdom</strong>",84,4.0

Overall I believe it is still a good deal. Unfortunately out of their control is the location. It is 15 minute walk to the hotel from Shinagawa station and while there is a shuttle bus it is not always convenient. Obtaining a taxi especially during rush hour or during inclement weather can take up to 30 minutes (I was late for a meeting and had luggage so no alternative (could have used Japan Taxi App).But within control of the hotel is their service. During my 3 day stay my desk table had sticky remnants of food and what I am guessing is soda that was never cleaned. The bathroom floor was also not cleaned. The service while polite and staff trying hard, was not up to standards of a 4 or 5 star hotel in Tokyo - I am guessing because the staff seemed young and inexperienced comparatively. I called for room service but my call to Service Express button went unanswered for 5 minutes.On a positive note, the breakfast is very good with a nice juice station and fresh egg and waffle station. Quality of the breakfast food is better than many local hotels.Overall for the price of the hotel for what you get is a bargain. I would recommend if you are patient, have extra time - basically on vacation but probably not for business.","San Francisco, California","Jack F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",70,3.0

Drinks are very expensive and a Merlot which is retail £9.95 in the UK was £28 for a regular glass .There is an executive lounge you can use if you have an exec room which we did but this is a tad bizarre . They serve some food up until 7:30 but even if there is loads left they just take it away and presumably throw it away. They would not let us have the volume up on the TV in place of the piped music despite every person (8) wanting it. The reason was it will disturb people !The following night a family with 2 small children ran riot in the lounge shouting and screaming and not told to quieten down so we left.Breakfast was good but beware the buffet closes early and then it is a la carte with not a huge choice , service at breakfast was very good.On leaving we brought our own cases down and checked out and said we were having breakfast before we left and could they sort our cases and we were told by reception to take our cases to the porters at the front of the hotel some distance away.

If you are expecting to get a workout in plan on bringing your Yoga mat and download an app. The “gym” is probably one of the worst I have seen in a long time.

The location is great, a 10 minute walk from Shinagawa station (easy to connect to just about anywhere it seems, with the Yamanote line and multiple Shinkasen trains) but far enough away to be removed from the hustle and bustle of the area immediately around the station. Note there is a shuttle bus running between Shinagawa and the hotel, check their schedule and find the waiting spot just to the left of the station West Exit (if you don't see the WING store, you're at the wrong exit). The hotel is a top tier Marriott property, and provides exactly what you'd expect in such a property. Excellent service, good food, quiet rooms and a peaceful location. The breakfast restaurant is frequently busy, so if you're in a hurry, you need to time your breakfast time to insure you can get in and out in a timely fashion. They do open an extra room when necessary. The shuttle bus also serves a large adjacent business complex so if you're planning on using the shuttle during rush hours (to the hotel in the morning hours, from the hotel at 5PM) expect a long queue.",finger lakes NY,"chasinUpstateNewYork</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>finger lakes NY</strong>",185,5.0

As this a relatively high end hotel I would have expected fitness and pool access for all guests. Room was very nice and big but smelled of smoke. Last but not least the hypocrisy of caring for the planet when almost every little thing in the bathroom was wrapped individually in plastic!! Having stayed in several other hotels in Jpn it seems standard to provide all these things but at least the other did not pretend to care for the environment. It’s time these luxury chains think hard about their single-use plastic waste. ,"Gembloux, Belgium","McU4</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gembloux, Belgium</strong>",40,3.0

We liked it then.Things have changed, not for the right reason.My wife and I are non-smokers, so we always ask for a non-smoking room.After entering the room, we immediately can tell that someone smoked in the room.Hotel sprayed freshener heavily, so we also smelled the freshener.We notified the front desk and the front desk manager was trying to find another room.However, five rooms later, we still didn't find any of the room without smoke smell.All the rooms were on non-smoking floor. The front desk manager didn't get how the room has smoke smell.That's disappointing. No wonder they have so many non-smoking rooms with smoke smell.We ended in a one bed room since no more 2-bed rooms that were smoke free.Since we traveled with 2 little kids, that was not pleasant.And that one-bed room still had smoke smell, but not as heavy as the others.Breakfast was still good, but was handled poorly.We came down around 9am, and by that time, there was a long line.We're given a number and waited for about half an hour.The wait staff called the numbers in Japanese. Since most of us were foreigners, no one responded to her calling.She then tried to look at our numbers one guest at a time which make the wait even longer.And still she did the same the next time she called.The restaurant manager should have seen this issue and corrected it.Also, no swimming pool for under-16 kids. So that's a minus.Concierge was great. Always willing and trying to help.Executive lounge was disappointing. We only went in there for water, as there's no good snacks.We complained in the Marriott survey, and we got very standard response from the front desk manager.

The rooms are a bit dated, and not much English programming on TV, but then again you are in Japan where this is the norm. The Executive Lounge is also nice. The buffet breakfast is not on par with other international Marriott properties; the hotel should step up a bit here. This hotel is set within an excellent garden area and office park with frequent free shuttles to Shinagawa station. What really makes this property outstanding is the concierge staff who gave us numerous suggestions for restaurants and places to go.One warning I have is that I found that there are rooms here that are sold as ""non smoking"" that smell heavily of smoke. The first night we checked in, both of the two rooms we reserved had strong cigarette smells. Thankfully the staff found two rooms on another floor that did not have this smell. Not sure if this is just the Marriott or Tokyo hotels in general, so be warned when booking a room to make sure it has not been smoked in. We came off a long international flight only to come to our room and realize it had this strong smell and had to wait 30 mins for the front desk to find 2 alternate rooms.","New York City, New York","MillionMilr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",117,3.0

One complaint with this room was that the bed faced one direction and the TV was on the side wall making it nearly impossible to watch TV in bed. There were quite a few stations, but nothing in English, so we didn’t keep the TV on long anyway. My other complaint is the step in the bathroom. There is a small step from the sink area to where the toilet and tub/shower are located. It seems like a very odd place to put a step, it is unexpected and I’m sure people fall. Just keep and eye out for the step if you get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night or after you step out of the shower. If you have access to the concierge lounge, it is very nice.

There were selection of Western, Japanese, Chinese dishes. Not the biggest buffet but there were plenty of things to choose from. One thing I was amazed is the chef still served new food near the closing time of the breakfast. Late comers for breakfast sometimes get fewer choices because the buffet station would be left empty. Not here. I saw a few times the chef still bring out (mostly Japanese) food just to make it look complete at 10:00, when the breakfast was supposed to finish.The front desk staff was nice and capable to handle all of my requests too. Have a few packages for me. They handled them perfectly and seamlessly. Had to change another credit card to pay. They did it perfectly. Thank you Natsumi and your colleagues!

And from Shinagawa, one takes the shuttle to the hotel. Timetable is on the website. Note the shuttle is not just for the hotel so it looks exactly like regular bus.

Once we picked this hotel I started my communication with the concierge desk a couple of months prior to our arrival. This was our first trip to Asia and we wanted to stay in a place that had familiar surroundings and food and also a concierge who would be able to help us navigate Tokyo. The chief concierge, Ymke Simonis, provided exceptional service prior to our arrival to help me plan a private day trip to Mount Fuji, a private day trip to the Nikko area as well as a day tour of Tokyo our first day so that we could get a little acquainted with the giant city. We were only here for seven nights so we used guides to try and see as much as possible. Throughout our stay she and her staff were extremely friendly and helpful in every way.The bell desk and door greeting staff were all very pleasant and very helpful with any directions you may want to include traveling by taxi, bus or train. Every time we left the hotel we were greeted with “have a nice day“. Every time we came back to the hotel whether it was at the end of the day or sometime in the middle of the day we were always greeted with a wide smile and a “welcome back” greeting. I particularly liked the door greeter Thi Anh Thu Pham who always had a very large gracious smile and was very eager to help in anyway.After the staff got to know us in a couple days we were always greeted by name whether it was at the breakfast buffet or coming and going from the hotel. The hotel is in a great location and provides a free shuttle to the Shinagawa train station which leaves every few minutes. The hotel is immediately next to a very large business building so there are a lot of commuters.This Marriott is also an easy 15 minute taxi ride from the Haneda airport. With 2 suitcases and 2 carry-ons we did not want to tackle the train station with luggage. If you have one small to medium bag then it might be OK however we chose this airport because of its close location to the hotel.Because of my Marriott status we were able to have the breakfast buffet each morning. The staff was exceptional and the manager, Masashi Ono, is great. Again after a couple of mornings we were always greeted by Marical with a large grin and smile as she was saying good morning and our name.For Marriott members there is an executive lounge on the top floor with great views and snacks however there is no true breakfast upstairs. The breakfast is the breakfast buffet downstairs which had a huge selection of both American and Japanese food. The room itself was a standard Marriott room although in keeping with Japanese style was admittedly a little bit smaller than an American hotel. But it provided plenty of space and we had a corner room with nice views of Tokyo Tower. There were robes, a mini bar, a safe, and lots of plugs for your electronics. There were times when we wanted to get ice or additional towels and the service was almost immediate. It was unlike any other Marriott or any other hotel for that matter that we’ve ever stayed at. When we asked for additional towels they would often be at our door in less than 10 minutes.I would highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again when I go back to Tokyo.","Camarillo, California","AdvtrTrvlr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Camarillo, California</strong>",519,5.0

Surprisingly I was charged again on check out.It was only when I confronted with Mr Tomokazu the room manager and shown him I am charged twice as per Bank SMS.

Family Mart in basement of building next door, which is nice since train station or other stores and restaurants are not close.

This should be listed on their website and highlighted in the confirmation email. Also, there is only 1 express train from the station that connects to other metro stops.

I was taken up to my room (as it turns out by Mr. Sakurai, the front desk manager) and when I arrived I noticed a bottle of deodorizer on the desk. I commented to him that I had never seen that before. Well it didn't take long to realize that the deodorizer was to try to cover the smell of cigarette smoke. Frankly, I felt deceived. I went back to the desk to complain and have my room changed. Due to high occupancy, the room choice was limited and I was placed in room 209 (despite my profile noting my preference for high floors). The room may have been in the same category as the rate I booked, but it seemed smaller. I don't feel the front desk staff showed any interest in my situation when I discussed it with them, nor any concern that neither room was consistent with what was in my profile.

There is a shuttle that runs between the hotel and Shinagawa station every day at different frequency and the airport limosine bus from Haneda airport (and I believe Narita) does stop at the hotel too. Midway between the hotel and Shinagawa station, they have this ""Ramen street"" which has some good ramen shops and wel worth a try (or two). Besides that, there are not much other interesting attractions. Check InI arrived very early and was at the hotel before 7am. As expected there was no one and I was helped immediately. I was lucky (or maybe based on my status) managed to get a room that early. No upgrade was provided (unless I waited until early afternoon for the room - but that was only to a higher floor) so I just accepted what I was available since it was just a 1 night stay. I was also asked to choose my arrival gift which I requested to be delivered later that evening. I was given a rundown of my Elite benefits at the hotel. RoomI was assigned a room on the 8th floor (out of the close to 20+ floor of the hotel) facing the railway tracks. If the TV was no on, you could hear the trains passing by, but this was not a big bother to me - however it could be for those who are sensitive to noise. It seems that after 10 pm and before 7am, the disturbance from the trains are close to zero.The size of the room was OK, though still smaller compared to other Marriotts outside of Japan but much bigger than the average hotel rooms at other type of Japanese based brand hotels.They had the usual coffee/tea making facilities available and a well stocked minibar. Internet speed was good -stable and sufficiently fast for normal browsing.Bathroom size was ok with a bathtub. Water pressure and temperature was good. The bed was I suspect a queen size bed, but it was comfortable and there was well positioned lighting and other controls by the bedside. One item to note is that all plugs are Japanese plugs standard and there did not see to have be any USB charger available. Room temperature control was good and easy to use. Executive LoungeThe hotel seems to have recently moved the Executive lounge from the 1st floor (same floor as the lobby) to the 24th floor which is a big improvement. The previous lounge area was windowless and much smaller. The new lounge area has much more seating and there is a nice view (~180deg) of the Shinagawa area down to Tokyo Bay ( you can see to the distance planes taking off from HND).During the day, the lounge has small bites available (mainly M&M's, Kitkat, Shortbread cookies, etc. In the evening, during the evening hors d'oeuvres hour, it is mainly small individual appetizers and desserts.There was quite a number of staff in the lounge that did effectively clear the tables. Lounge access is by the key card - therefore they don't really request for your room number since it is limited access to the key card.BreakfastBreakfast is served in the main restaurant at the 1st floor. No breakfast option at the lounge. The breakfast area is not large, so there can be a possibility during certain hours the wait can be long.Breakfast spread is good, with lots of options and eggs to order. Service is ok, although maybe due to the pressure, they do sometimes tend to forget orders. For example after settling in, I ordered Green tea, but this never appeared during the whole time. I saw that this happened too at tables near me - the guests had to remind someone for their orders.Also tables are placed quite close to each other, so for some this could be a not so nice experience.ServiceIn general, service is OK especially for Japan. However for hotel of this standard and especially in Japan, I would have expected much better service. For example, in the morning after checking in and getting my request for my arrival gift for later delivery, this never arrived. After waiting 30 mins after the requested time, I had to call to ask about it - I could have just ignored and bring it up the next day during check out. When calling about it, I was informed that I had chosen the points instead of the choices and even after that, I had to wait about 20 mins before it arrived.The other example of small service failure is the forgetting about customer orders during breakfast.OverallAll in all, this hotel is OK. I've noticed compared to my previous stays some good changes and some improvement area. For the first time visitor to Tokyo, this hotel would not be the best property to use a the base due to the limited options from Shinagawa station (there is no Metro line, and with the JR lines, the stations might still be quite a walk to the attractions). The hotel is close to Haneda is a plus point even as an airport hotel. For me, I will only choose this property if the price is right and all my plans or destination is accessible within the JR or Keisei Line trains.","Eindhoven, The Netherlands","nldogbert</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Eindhoven, The Netherlands</strong>",331,3.0

Their email response and arrangement is wonderful. The staff can speak English pretty well. When we check-in, it was such a warm welcome to us (worse thing I did not get that person's name whom checked us in); he was so nice even he told us they could not upgrade our room. Then he suddenly went to a room and gave us 2 little gifts (chopsticks = good things come), which he really didn't need to do it since the room upgrade is really based on availability, so that we totally understood that we may not get any; anyway, we really appreciate his gesture.Location/Limousine Bus:Location for this hotel would be better choice for business, since it is located away from the busy area, it is a very quiet area. Since this time we went there as leisure; therefore, it maybe a bit far away from the JR or any sightseeing spot; however, we still love this hotel and say Thanks to the C/I person! However, one good thing is the limousine bus, you basically do not need to carry any of your luggage literally, from C/O to bus to Narita, you basically did not need to carry your luggage at all. That is very important to shoppers!!!

We have loyaly stayed here over the last 7 or so years and we have patiently dealt with the ongoing issues of poor internet connectivity, zero food options after 2300, and the overly packed lounge, but when we start putting Marriott Platinum Elite Plus Ambassadors in the lowest level corner rooms facing the railroad tracks (715) it’s cleary time to move on. Worst part, when a room of this “quality” is knowingly assigned at 14:30 in the afternoon, it becomes painfully obvious that the management team doesn’t care how loyal you are to the brand. It’s even more painful when the front desk staff plays stupid and try’s to convince you that no other rooms were available when we know for a fact that wasn’t true! We aren’t asking for an upgrade in anyway, we just want the room preferences to be recognized. Evidently, that’s asking too much. Well, I just spent my last two nights at this hotel and we shall look for a better option. I’ll save the 42,000 yen next time and just sleep on the tracks right outside my window(s) , it might be quieter. What a huge disappointment, but then again, what did I really expect from my 235 night a year commitment to the Marriott Corporation.

It is always a great experience to meet new people and new cultures. The Japanese people stand out for their extreme education, friendliness and cordiality. We were impressed with its customs and history, from its ancient Jomon civilization to the people of today, being main protagonists emperors, shoguns and samurai. Their religious and philosophical traditions so different from the Western ones are a point of great importance that opened us other horizons and perspectives of life, expressed in several temples that we visited, mainly Shinto and Buddhist. Finally, the cult of the nature that these people have is worthy of being highlighted, being high points the ""sakura"" and the ""momiji"". Of these, we had the opportunity to enjoy the ""momiji"" of the autumnal season, fully impregnated of vegetation with reddish colours, which, in reality, is very beautiful and was for us greatly appreciated. We began our visit in Tokyo, the current capital of the country, formerly known as Edo. We chose the Tokyo Marriott Hotel for our 5-night stay in this city. This hotel is about 1 hour from Narita International Airport by train to Shinagawa (Narita Express) and features a complimentary and frequent shuttle between the hotel and this station, in a 5-minute drive. The hotel is away from all tourist attractions, but has multiple accesses available either by subway or train. The property is part of the ""Trust Tower"" building, sharing with it its infrastructures such as fitness centre and indoor swimming pool. The hotel has pleasant common areas and is now renovated. Upon arrival, we were welcomed and were assigned the room #2211. It seemed to us only a standard room, with a ""small"" King bed, which however was comfortable. The AC, while allowing the proper temperature, was a bit noisy. There was complimentary Nespresso coffee, tea and water, replenished daily. Note that the bathroom had an electronic toilet that allowed a perfect hygiene. All the necessary amenities were also available, replenished daily and generously. Also worthy of mention is the availability of an Android smartphone that could be used in the city. We had access to the buffet breakfast in the main restaurant, which we considered to be of excellent quality and variety, especially when compared to other Marriott properties we know of. As a Platinum Premier member, we had access to the Executive Lounge, which provided a regular variety of items, which quickly became repetitive throughout the stay. We must emphasize that the high point of the hotel is the excellent service offered by all staff, from the bellman to the restaurant staff. In conclusion, we made good choice in choosing this hotel for our stay in Tokyo and we recommend it.","Aroeira, Portugal","jorgeeantonio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aroeira, Portugal</strong>",126,4.0

I know the location comment will be somewhat controversial. Its about a 10+ minute walk from Shinagawa station. That's not bad for a casual stroll, but when you're pulling a larger suitcase and its warm out, and its uphill, its not great. There are a few other hotels closer to the station. I guess they have a free shuttle (would have been nice to know, especially when I asked the bellman which way to go to the station while pulling my suitcase), but that should give you an idea how far it actually is. The layout of the hotel is also a bit confusing.

I wanted to go the the pool, but you are required to take off your shoes and, given that the floors were so worn and bad, I decided to forego the experience. As well, all the signage around the hotel has stickers taping off information on the hotel maps. At the beginning I thought that it was because they were making changes or renovations. Now, after several years of coming here, I can’t understand why the hotel management simply doesn’t make new boards with the proper signage, as opposed to having a bunch of stickers covering information. It just looks bad and unprofessional, unbecoming of Marriott’s global standards. Lastly, the Executive Lounge is not very appealing. It lacks some of the essential elements that are usually present at full-service Marriotts. I would encourage the hotel to benchmark its lounge to other Marriott properties to see what they can do to improve, especially for the business traveler who does not want to deal with a crowded restaurant in the mornings.

The location is about a 15 minute walk to Shinagawa station, though they do run a bus service 3 times an hour. But step out of the hotel for a walk, and it’s a pretty dingy location. Nothing much around. As a Marriott Platinum member, I was offered an upgrade. So basically the same room type but on a higher floor. Why that’s an upgrade, I have no idea. Availability for better room types showed on their booking page, so I’m disappointed that the “space available upgrade” meant being a couple of floors higher. Other benefits were complimentary breakfast, lounge access and 20% off food & drink at the restaurant.In fairness the lounge was nice with a good number of options for the light evening meal service. It was very crowded even for a Sunday evening, so get there early. Breakfast had good variety compared to the Sheraton. The problem I had here was that none of the food items was labelled on a Monday morning. Guests were asking each other if they knew what the food items were. I complained about this twice and was told that for some reason they didn’t have labels for that morning (????). Overall it’s a pleasant hotel to stay in, nice rooms, modern an decent food. I wouldn’t really stay again and go for a place where I’d get a better upgrade. I would also say that I didn’t find the staff particularly welcoming or friendly.

While the hotel appears to be within walking distance of Shinagawa station, I'd highly recommend taking the free Marriott shuttle bus from/to the station or a taxi - as it is a good 10 minute ride by car. Also it's a bit confusing to find the bus stop at Shinagawa station so you may want to investigate the location beforehand.As to the hotel - the property seems to have been very recently renovated as all public areas and rooms are upgraded and modern. The lobby is enormous and reception is actually located quite a distance from the front door - the entire lobby is pretty much occupied by the lobby restaurant.The rooms are typical Tokyo size - as mentioned upgraded and modern - only no electrical outlets next to the bed (pet peeve). Bed and bedding were very comfortable and there is a Nespresso machine as well as a hot pot for tea in the room. The bathroom is a good size with a combined tub/shower - believe some rooms may have a separate shower stall set up.We had a breakfast included rate at the lobby restaurant and there was an enormous, good selection of Western and Asian choices, including an egg/waffle station. The breakfast gets very, very busy with the restaurant filling up. Recommend earlier the better to beat the crowd.I did not use the fitness center as it had an open time of 7am (too late for me) - it is located in the tower next to the hotel and I believe it is a private facility shared between the hotel and the public.I did use the Executive Lounge and found it to be one of the best lounges I've experienced in terms of food and drink choices available at Happy Hour as well as the fantastic view from the 28th floor.The location of the hotel is a bit ""odd"" for a tourist - probably great for business folks who work in the area. There are a couple of commercial areas - in either direction of the hotel, each about a 15 minute walk - and mainly comprised of restaurants, convenience stores and in 1 area lots of ""night"" life. These areas also each have a JR or subway line so with a short walk you can get to other more touristy areas of Tokyo (such as Shibuya which is a short train ride).The only minor issue occurred on my first morning where the Wifi suddenly stopped working - a call to Guest Services was fairly useless as I was told it is working when clearly it was not and there was no offer to at least investigate within my room or that part of the hotel But after about an hour it did start working again. Also we had a remote hotspot (picked up from the airport) which did not function in this corner of the hotel (9th floor) It may be a ""dead spot"" for coverage...Overall I'd recommend Tokyo Marriott - the service from the staff is top-notch - and once you figure out how to get around with some walking you can manage your way around both the local area and other parts of Tokyo.","Hudson, Massachusetts","Jerry E</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hudson, Massachusetts</strong>",98,4.0

I've been to many hotel breakfasts, this one may be the best.The good: The hotel staff was overall very nice, and tried to be helpful. The mediocre: The regular concierge seemed to be on vacation or something, so other staff filled in, their helpfulness on a 1-10 scale ranked from 3 to 8. There is a hotel shuttle, but if you arrive in the Shinagawa station, there is no clue where to find it (bus stop 6 just south of the exit). It can be extremely crowded, as it is shared with an office building. Alternatively, a taxi to or from the station is about five dollars.The hotel gym and pool are also shared with the office building. The pool is nice, the gym mediocre. Oddly, hotel guests aren't allowed to use the lockers where locals put their shoes before entering the locker rooms. The gym doesn't open until 6, the pool until 7, which was annoying b/c given jet lag, there were nights I would have used the gym at 4 or 5 AM.The lounge was mediocre for us, because there was a very limited selection of soft drinks and snacks, and they didn't change. But if you drink alcohol, the free booze could save you a lot of money vs. going to a bar.The bad:We traveled as a family of 5, and requested connecting rooms well in advance. Oddly, the hotel apparently only has one connecting room (a suite), and that was booked, so we go rooms together. I'm not sure why, but even though one of us had paid an extra $20 a night for a room on a high floor (that was what was available at the time of booking), we were both put on a low floor (next to each other). No discount was offered for the ""downgrade.""The ugly:The rooms we were given directly overlooked a busy railroad track, with many trains coming to and fro. Considering how close the trains were, it wasn't very noisy, but compared to the noise levels one should expect at a good hotel, it was much, much noisier than it should have been. Fortunately, we were all exhausted from jet lag and touring so it didn't bother us too much, but under other circumstances I would have insisted on changing rooms and if nothing was available, changing hotels. There is no excuse in 2018 for not having proper noise abatement measures in the room. PS Our room with 2 double beds had a couch that could be slept on. We could have managed with 5 in a room if we needed to, if you have a family with 2 or 3 kids and 2 adults, you can consider whether you want to squeeze into one room or not.","Potomac, Maryland","David B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Potomac, Maryland</strong>",94,3.0

There is a shuttle from the train station every 20 minutes or so. When we first arrived we could not figure out where the bus is. You need to exit the station towards Central Gate, look for the line of people waiting for taxis and turn left towards the Broadway store. Look for bus station number 6. Since we could not find the bus we took a taxi, it is 410 yen. We used the taxi several times and the price varied between 410 to 770 yen depending on traffic.We are a family and booked two rooms. We emailed the hotel prior to our arrival asking for connecting rooms and they said that they will try to accommodate us if rooms are available. When we arrived we learned that they only have suites that are connecting, no rooms. Since we are gold members we are eligible for an upgrade, but no connecting suites were available. We made a reservation for rooms on a high floor but we received rooms on a low floor because that's where the hotel had rooms on the same floor. So basically we got downgraded. If joining rooms are important to you, book suites or stay elsewhere.Staff was very nice. We liked Koichi who was helping in the concierge desk and the front desk. There was a young Japanese girl who was helping the concierge and we felt like she was doing a research project when we asked her a question. She had to look up everything, consult with others, and she was soft spoken. The last day we saw a Caucasian woman in the concierge desk but she was busy. I think that the hotel could use a native English speaker, who knows Tokyo well, in the concierge desk.As Marriott gold members we received lounge access. Breakfast is served in the dining room in the lobby. Breakfast was really nice with a lot of options. You can ask for omelette made to order, delicious French toast, waffle, there is an udon soup station, breads, cheese, meats, jams, smoked salmon, fish, rice, very nice fruit selection, juices, shakes, cereal. There is a Caucasian chef who makes very good omelettes. The breakfast is around 3200 yen otherwise.The lounge has appetizers from 5:30 to 7:30. They have guacamole, hummus, carrots, pretzels, cakes, kit Kat, gummy bears, hors d'oeuvres such as mini corn dogs, taco station, free alcohol, coffee machine and juices. It is a very nice spread and they are family friendly. My only suggestion for improvement is the hors d'oeuvres, they were not that great.We used the shuttle bus to the train once. It drops you off across from the station and you need to walk on a pedestrian bridge to cross the busy street. With a stroller it is not that pleasant. Also, since the bus arrives every 20 minutes starting at 7:30 am, if the bus was not there when we arrived we took a taxi to the station. If you are planning to walk a lot during the day I suggest not walking from the hotel to the station and back to conserve energy. The hotel is located south to central Tokyo. If I understood the geography better I would have stayed in the Shinjuku area. It would have been nice to have attractions within walking distance, which you don't have there.Make sure to pack ear plugs. Although the hotel is not next to the train station, our room was overlooking railroad tracks and you could hear the train late at night and early in the morning.",,VioletPurpl,19,4.0

Now that Marriott and SPG have combined, being a platinum SPG member for so many years, I thought I would experimented and try the category 8 Marriott in Tokyo rather than being safe and staying with SPG.I had read reviews about the location being near the Shinagawa Station. And shuttles available for guests. Positive. But that’s where the compliments stop.Let me start with the executive club which some poor guests pay extra for but I received complimentary as being a platinums member.Well if you like children under 10 running amok while seeking sanctuary look else where. It’s more a crèche than a executive lounge. How a professional hotel allows such poor standards I just don’t understand. Furthermore, the canapés, are average, the same almost night after night, we gave up and just didn’t bother and just went out for dinner without the noise, without children running around like it was a playground.One more observation, don’t stay here Saturday night and expect to get a seat in the club lounge. We couldn’t, gave up and left but watched as some leaned against walls, having a drink and canapé as extends families enjoyed the facilities.Upgrade was non existent, breakfast buffet in the morning is pedestrian, coffee is so abysmal, it was an insult to a coffee bean, and my senses.The one and only reason why this poor hotel doesn’t get one star is the staff. They are lovely, do their best to please. What a shame they are let down by management not having the processes and systems to recognise premium guests and then afford them the sanctuary of the executive lounge in the evening.Unfortunately I prepaid my second visit otherwise I would have canceled and stayed at the tried and true Westin in Ebisu.Tired and failed, this hotel doesn’t deserve to have the Marriott name until some fundamental changes are made to accommodate premium customers.","Melbourne, Australia","Raffster58</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",70,2.0

I wanted to see what it was like and as a result, I can say that I will not be staying at a Marriott ever again which includes SPG / Ritz Carlton hotels brought into the same program. I don’t believe I’m entitled to anything or expect a lot but my stay was just a huge disappointment. The cheapest room rate included lounge access which Gold members already have so there was no benefit in having the membership in this case for me, but then again, the lounge was nothing to write home about and was just a glorified waiting room.Maybe I’ve been spoiled by the Executive and Club Lounges at Hilton and Intercontinental respectively where there is proper food, but the Marriott lounge provided just snacks. Paying nearly $550 AUD (over 44,000 yen) for one night, I expected more than just chips, carrot sticks, Kit Kats, cookies and muesli bars. Unfortunately, that’s what they had and to make things worse, when the staff saw the chips bowl empty (which I didn’t even get to have because some guy took it all), it wasn’t refilled but the bowl was just taken away. Arriving straight from the airport, I was checked in and at the lounge before 9pm. As I entered, there was one cake and some ice cream in the fridge. Decided to have some ice cream and cake after whatever snacks were left but when I thought it was time to try the dessert, they were gone. I didn’t see it but it was taken away before I knew it. This was before 9.30pm and the lounge closes at 11.30pm. I understand cleaning time is required for the staff but this is just cake and ice cream rather than hot food so I don’t believe cleaning would be too difficult? Maybe it’s kept for the next night so no cleaning is even required? I think a more appropriate time would have been 10.30pm but even if that’s not possible, the staff should have notified the guests that it was being taken away. Even restaurants tell guests it’s time for last order.The room itself was also very tired, shower/bath tub was dirty and the amenities box was broken. This is definitely not a room worth paying over 44,000 yen for. I can accept that there was no room upgrade available because it was Golden Week holiday in Japan so no empty rooms, however, being told the 'Guaranteed 4 p.m. Late Checkout' was not available either started to make me agitated. This hotel is not a 'resort and convention hotels' according to the T&Cs where late checkout is ‘subject to availability’. There was no mention while booking that because it was Golden Week the benefit would be ‘subject to availability’. The site T&Cs do not mention 'subject to availability' but instead it is 'guaranteed'. I have read both the English and Japanese websites and both say 'guaranteed'. The only time it said 'subject to availability' was in Japanese when the staff handed the explanation of Gold member 'benefits' sheet. Is each hotel allowed to have their own separate T&Cs? After politely trying to speak with the staff to request late checkout, she went as far as to say that guests should have known that it was not available because there were no rooms due to the busy season. This was the final straw. Excuse me?? This is about room management because the hotel knows how many Gold and above members have this benefit when they booked the room and the hotel will also have statistics on how many members are likely to make use of it so it should have taken this into account when management availability rather than just saying it was not available. Do not put this obligation back onto the guests. It was just plain rude and absolutely appalling. I don’t even expect the cheap APA or Toyoko Inn business hotels in Japan to have this type of attitude at 10,000yen a night so paying this price for this ‘service’ was just unacceptable. As an IHG Ambassador, I have always had 4pm checkout because it is a 'guaranteed' benefit when I stay at Intercontinental and they don’t try to change the terms to suit them. The only thing decent was the breakfast but that was normal and nothing fancy, especially for the price paid.With such a poor lounge (pretty but that’s about it), dirty and old room, bad service and basically no benefits for being an elite member, I will not be staying at another Marriott chain hotel again and as SPG is becoming Marriott as well, I’ve given up on Sheraton / St Regis etc. I can accept all benefits not available if I’m notified in advance but being told I’m responsible I should know a benefit would not be available was just shocking to say the least. The name Marriott will bring back this horrible experience for me and I won’t be able to have a good relaxing time anymore. As a result I’ll be sticking to Hilton / Conrad and Intercontinental.","New South Wales, Australia","Jim W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New South Wales, Australia</strong>",9,1.0

They also have a shuttle bus which picks up just outside the station and runs every 20min. Best way to get to hotel is either the Narita Express train to Shinagawa (then walk or hotel shuttle) or take a limo bus direct to the hotel. Some people say this hotel is not centrally located but nothing really is – Tokyo is very big and tourist and business locations are all over. What is important is a good transit connection and Shinagawa is one of the best – many lines, on the Yamanote loop line, and also contains one of the two Shinkesan bullet train stations to everywhere else across Japan.Room & Bath: Rooms are newly (last 5yrs) renovated and have all the normal Marriott amenities. There is a sitting couch and a round table as your business desk (this may actually be a negative as I’d prefer more of an official work desk setup). Higher floors have nice city view. Large (50”?) TV with good English channel selection. Kuerig coffee maker. Amenities (wifi, gym, pool, etc.): Wifi is very strong and consistent. You have free of charge access to local gym attached to the same building - and equipment and facilities are quite extensive (lots of free weights, indoor pool, tennis court). Food & Beverage: The hotel has a very nice lobby bar/restaurant also with an outside patio. There are also a couple nicer dining options on the upper floors. The breakfast buffet is wonderfully extensive and they have newly expanded their executive lounge and moved it to the top floor (it is now awesome compared to previous ground floor setup). There are also many external dining and drinking options if you want to take a short walk toward either Shinagawa or Gotenyama stations. Staff & Service Level: Staff if typical Japanese style with exceptional service and they are always willing to help. Misc.: One of the nicer Japanese gardens is directly behind the hotel. Would I Repeat?: Yes. A great choice at a reasonable price. One of my Tokyo favorites.",USA,"imespUSA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>USA</strong>",53,5.0

The lounge, same thing -- plush chairs you can sink into, which are good for cocktails, not good for work. They have a room called the Executive Lounge, which is 6000 yen, and whose name suggests its a business lounge. It is not. It is a daycare for three-generation families who revel in the free food and running space for children. There are no tables/desks set for working.

From Tokyo station, you have to walk for around ten minutes to Marriott Hotel. In my case, it took me around fifteen to twenty minutes because I had to stop walking every once in a while due to backache. The weather on our second day there was really cold, reaching 2 degrees because it was raining. The people at Marriott Hotel were very courteous. They can speak English really well and assisted me when I asked where I can get a ride to Shibuya. Marriott Courtyard reception was located at the 4th Floor. If you are a member of the Marriott Courtyard, you will get a discount for breakfast at the LAVAROCK. Instead of paying 3,200 yen for breakfast, we only paid 2,000 yen. It was a pretty reasonable price for a complete breakfast. The hotel’s reception had a small lobby with a refrigerator that offered unlimited fruits, juices and candies for its members anytime they wanted. The Fitness Center was at the 3rd Floor where our room was also located. Our room was pretty small but it was fine with me.Fronting Marriott Hotel was a restaurant that offered subway sandwiches. At the back of the hotel was Starbucks and beside Starbucks was a convenience store. Located just one building after Marriott Hotel was a metro train station where you can ride for a minimum of 170 yen. From there to Shibuya, you will pay for almost 200 yen. Upon going home, we only had a walking distance from Marriott Hotel to the South side of Tokyo station. There was a bus named JR lines that could bring you to the airport for 1,000 yen however they only allowed passengers with one baggage to ride the bus. Since I had more than one baggage, I asked where I can ride another bus and I was told that just across the JR lines bus station, around 150 meters away, was Kainsai station where passengers with more than one baggage were allowed to ride the bus.

The hotel rooms overlook a large train track and you can hear -- albeit muffled -- the sound of the clickty clack of the trains on the tracks day and night. I am not a particularly light sleeper, but if I were, I suppose it would have kept me up in the night. All in all it was not a place I would come back to, least of all because of the odd configuration of the room.","Geneva, Switzerland","lordbyron59</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Geneva, Switzerland</strong>",101,3.0

You walk-in to the hotel being greeted by the bellhops. The modern open style restaurant and bar is the second thing you see. You are escorted if preferred to the check in. The rooms are big for and spacious for Asia. The king bed is a California king bed. the room is perfect for two people, three very easy going friends. The bathroom is modern. Tub/shower combo is inviting. They even give you bath salts. The toilet seat is heated and has an electronic bidet. I could spend hours playing video games while spoiling my bum with the perfect amount of warmth. It’s definitely a royal flush with the many options for refreshing your bum. Why stand and pee when you can sit in welcoming warmth. Ok, ok I’ll move on but I do shed a tear saying goodbye to my favorite John. The concierge lounge is awesome. It has snacks all day. Sodas and juices. 5-7 is the evening appetizers. There was 8 choices of finger foods. Also dips and two types of chips. Guacamole, hummus, salsa (very spicy caution) 5 -9:30 there is adult beverages. There is a Japanese whisky with the best Smokey flavor. Absolute vodka and other fun spirits. The juices are fresh squeezed. So the grapefruit packs a punch. 2 canned beers and one white wine and one red blend wine but they are very good. They also have bubbly. They have candy and chocolates to spoil yourself with; M&ms and jelly belly beans are my favorite. The view is the best part. The concierge lounge is a reason not to leave the hotel. The fitness studio. Small but you can get a good workout in. The pool, hot tub and sauna are awesome. They also have a women’s and men’s only area to frolic naked in. I know Americans are prude and get squeamish around nudity please get over yourself. Anything sexual is offensive and completely in appropriate in this setting. Moving passed my rant . The breakfast buffet. They have fresh made to order eggs - omelets, eggs Benedict, fried eggs, waffles, French toast (fantastic). They have pho (savory soup for breakfast yes please and don’t knock it until you try it) they have Japanese cuisine, breads and spreads, Cheese, meats, pastries. Fresh squeezed juices and frozen juices. I made a pb&j to go and they brought me a to go bag. The hotel is awesome. Lots to do. Lots of reasons to not go out. But if you do. The concierge can hook you up with a private driver for about $40 bucks an hour. Pick upAnd drop off at the hotel. Very nice car too. I didn’t do my homework so I just told the driver to take me where I should see. Now for the main reason I write my review. The staff is exceptional. Friendly and genuine. If you have an issue with the staff. Then you should check yourself for the staff will go out of their way to make your stay happy. Language was a slight barrier but I was grateful for them to communicate with me and do their best. The hotel is a great choice.

We booked a quadruple room which was huge with almost 100sqm of space; for that price we would normally get less than half of that space in Tokyo. The kids bed were located in the living area and we had our own room. The kids were offered proper beds and not sofa beds. The bathroom was between our room and the living area so we could all access it conveniently and close off everything at bedtime and had enough privacy. However, the room and decor was a bit aged. The bathroom wasn’t super clean and I found some mould in the shower area and lot of accumulated dust under a bench that was used to store towels. I felt that the space wasn’t fully utilized either as there should have been more hooks for used towels and a hand towel rack was inexistent. The lighting in the bathroom was also a bit dark. The iron was cordless and low quality and couldn’t really iron properly with it. Humidifiers are available upon request and not de rigueur. The hotel is very close to Shinagawa JR station so we could hear trains and I don’t think that the windows were soundproof enough; I sleep with earplugs so it didn’t bother me that much. There is a convenient store located outside the hotel where we could stock up on fruits. We didn’t bother trying breakfast as they didn’t offer Japanese breakfast. A free shuttle bus is available between the hotel and Shinagawa station and it takes less than 15 minutes by foot. The main issue is that this place was a bit out of the city center and would take approx 25 minutes at least by taxi or by train to get to any places like Shinjuku or Marunouchi so if you’re just in Tokyo for just few days, somewhere more towards the city center would be more convenient.","Sydney, Australia","Y7303QIsuec</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",56,4.0

My husband and I were here during high season so we paid premium price here (as is everything in Japan.) But to us, it was worth every penny.

Pros: - 10 minute walk from Shinagawa Station (or you can take their free shuttle to and from the station that leaves about every 20 min.)- Free WIFI, although it was laggy at times- Spacious & clean rooms. Comfortable mattress and blankets - High-quality toiletries and a very good shower head - Nespresso in every room with complimentary capsules refilled daily (as well as TWG green and black tea) - Very clean & fully-equipped gym with everything you need; from barbells, gym mats, cardio/exercise machines, squat rack, to foam rollers - Family Mart and Post Office downstairs in the connecting building- First-class service by the housekeepers and concierge/bellmen Cons:- Food at their restaurant, Lounge & Dining G, is mediocre (unless you are having the breakfast buffet.) We had dinner here on our first night since we were tired from our 10-hour flight and didn't want to go out. Our food was very bland and disappointing, not to mention very expensive. We also ordered room service on another day and again, not good. I recommend only trying the breakfast buffet or going out to eat. Many local restaurant nearby. As you can see, the pros outweigh the cons by far for us. The only qualm we had with the hotel was the food.

That, of course, comes at a trade-off. The hotel is located away from most of the major business and tourist districts and difficult to get to unless you are traveling by taxi or car. The closest major station is about a 15 minute walk away and there are limited bus options. For business people with work in the area, it is fine.There were three areas in which the property fell down. The first is the executive lounge. It is one fairly small room. On both nights we visited the lounge it was so over capacity that they were taking reservations and encouraging guests to take whatever food and drink they wanted to their rooms. The self-serve bar is excellent and the staff is attentive. The food is fairly average, but with the capacity issue, the food was usually gone within a few minutes of being brought out.There is only one restaurant on the property, which is more of an afternoon tea and pastry type of place, although they do provide a full breakfast buffet. Unfortunately, the wait for breakfast was about 30 minutes. The closest alternatives are Starbucks and Denny's which are both about a 15 minute walk away. On the plus side, there is a convenience store on the property that sells its products at normal market prices (not the typical insanely inflated Marriott prices where a can of Coke can cost US$5).The hotel was generally well-kept. But there were some areas in which the hotel was not as clean as it should have been. The first was the fact that many of the rooms have been heavily smoked in. This is perhaps a cultural issue and could be overlooked. But there were areas in which the hotel was surprisingly dirty. I have attached a photo of the bathroom mold as an example. Lastly, although not a full time issue, the internet on the property was spotty. I found myself at times switching to mobile date for a better connection.","Taipei, Taiwan","EdwardS164</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",13,2.0

The level of graciousness, patience and attention to detail we experienced at this hotel was amazing. Special mention of Masakazu Numakura, the Assistant Front Manager. He helped us move rooms when we had issues with the room we were assigned and as it was late, personally helped with our luggage without complaining. He also helped with arranging a small surpise for my wife as we were celebrating our 18th anniversary and our checkout. An unassuming man, he nevertheless anticipated our needs and did everything efficiently, without any hint of displeasure. Also the breakfast lounge staff is manned by some superstars of hospitality. The international staff are never short on smiles and always ready with a kind and happy word. If I have any complaints, it would be the gym. Understandably it is not managed by Marriott, at least that is not the impression I got. It was decent but poorly located. Also the equipment needs some attention. As for the rooms, nothing bad to say. Clean and comfortable, it is bigger than most Japanese hotels and the view is quite outstanding on the higher floors. The free shuttle is very helpful and nearby Shinagawa station is a transport hub. Only downside is that the bus service should operate until 11pm at least. ",,mrjefe,4,5.0

Three of us stayed together in three different rooms during the same journey. Went to Kyoto and returned the next day due to Typhoon. We expected some sort of a written notification on the mammoth typhoon in our room, since we are tourists and traveling on our own. But we had to depend on internet and English speaking hotel staff. The hotel is just 5 minutes by free shuttle to Shinagawa railway station connecting all destinations. Airport shuttle is far cheaper and much more comfortable than cabs and takes 11/2hours to Nerita airport.

It's much easier than taking the Narita Express and then walking 10-15 minutes or taking the shuttle to the hotel.","Houston, Texas","TechMarauder</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",193,5.0

The only caveat is the Shinagawa location which is not ideal for first time visitors to Tokyo wanting seamless access to shopping, sightseeing and public transport.If you can get a decent rate and can live with being slightly out of central Tokyo, then the hotel won't disappoint.

It wouldn't have been my first choice simply due to the location, but it was already arranged by my husband's company since he was visiting on business. I tagged along and did some sight seeing, so the Shinagawa location meant long train rides to get to the main sites. I'm not including the location as a factor in my rating but I did want to mention. On the plus side, our hotel room was a good size, and well decorated and appointed. I definitely appreciated the Nespresso coffee in the room. Bed was comfortable and air conditioning worked well. Front desk service was always good. Where we encountered some problems were with dining and service in the restaurant. We had a slightly negative encounter our last morning with the hostess - on previous mornings, we simply showed our room key and gave our room number and that seemed to serve as notice that we should get the buffet for free. We had also received vouchers but since we weren't asked the first few days, we didn't think they were needed. So the last day, the hostess demanded the voucher, which was in the room. This was after we had been seated and already were eating. Trust me, we were not trying to steal breakfast, but that was the vibe we got from the hostess. Anyway, she finally left after we promised to bring the voucher down after we finished but it was an odd and embarrassing encounter. I mention this solely because there was a service breakdown somewhere that needs to be addressed and I hope hotel management reads this. Even if we were in the wrong, the hostess should have been friendlier and less accusatory. I will say that the breakfast buffet was really good with a great variety of items. Also, on several occasions, we didn't get coffee after asking for it. And on our final evening, we ate dinner at the restaurant, waited forever for our meals, and both were not great (and quite expensive). I probably wouldn't stay here again as a result of these factors. ","Roanoke, Virginia","Va_Hiker</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Roanoke, Virginia</strong>",33,3.0

The hotel was very clean, modern, and the rooms were very spacious for Tokyo (certainly not as large as you might see in some US cities where space is less expensive, just to set expectations). We were very comfortable here with 2 large suitcases, the bathroom especially was spacious, and the shower was tall enough for my 6'3"" husband.This hotel is a 10-minute walk from Shinagawa Station; to find it, exit the station via the Takanawa Exit (follow the yellow signs) and then cross the street toward the giant white building, which looks like a casino (it's actually a pachinko parlor). Turn left after crossing the street, then walk up the hill about 3/4 of a mile. You'll probably see the Gotenyama Trust office building first, but the hotel is attached to it.There is also a free bus from the Gotenyama building lobby to the Shinagawa train station, when it's really hot or you have lots of luggage.Shinagawa is a good station because it's on the Keikyu Line (which has an express train to/from the Haneda airport), the Shinkansen bullet train (for day trips to Kyoto or other cities), and also several JR train lines, which gets you almost anywhere in metropolitan Tokyo. You can also easily transfer to the subways after a short train ride, but some locations (like Shibuya) are a direct route from Shinagawa. The location of this hotel near the large train station was immensely advantageous.There are a few neighborhood restaurants near this hotel, but we didn't eat in the neighborhood because we were always out somewhere in a different location where there were many more food choices.There is a convenience store in the lobby of the attached Gotenyama Trust building too, great for picking up beverages, snacks, and breakfast items on your way home each evening if you don't want to spring for the $35/person breakfast buffet each day.I did the buffet one morning during our trip and it was very impressive, with both American and Asian items, too many things to try all in one meal. But I did not want to pay that much for breakfast *every* day.You do get a Toto washlet in the hotel rooms here.Worth the money for the location and access to transportation.

However, they don't operate after 10pm (the last bus from Shinagawa Station leaves at 9:55pm). Then, you need to either walk or get a taxi. Finally, their current executive lounge located on the first floor is subpar: too small and no view.

Staff couldn't even warm food at this time and the Family Mart downstairs closes at 11pm.The room is very nice but quite plainly decorated. The bathroom however looked quite old. Wifi and aircon worked well and housekeeping did a lovely job each day. We upgraded to the Executive Lounge for our final night at the cost of 6,000 ¥ each. When we arrived we were told there wasn't any room in the lounge and we should go and wait in our room for whenever a seat might become available.This was poor and I had to argue how they can justify charging people for nothing. I noticed two empty tables and after some arguing we were seated. A very poor and negative experience.The food in the lounge however was excellent and the range of drinks for the Happy Hour experience was fantastic. I hadn't expected champagne and this made the price worth it despite the lounge not being big enough to accommodate all guests and attitude of staff.Breakfast for the lounge is taken in the main restaurant so this was really nice with lots of choice. We didn't have a lot of time but still enjoyed it before taking the airport limousine to Haneda airport to pick up a car rental.

Nothing was mentioned on our reservation. i went straight down to the front desk to ask if it was possible to change to which i was told yes, if i was ok to switch to a king size. i said no problem and was given the key to my room. what wasn't mentioned was that i was given a smaller, lower quality (in particular the bathroom!) room. of course no change to the price. when i asked again the front desk whether there was a mistake, i was told that there were no other rooms available other than the larger smoking rooms or my current small lower standard room. when i said i preferred non smoking, but expected a reduced price if the only room available is of lower standard, i was told repeatedly that i had no choice and no effort would be made on the price. so there you go, i personally don't think it's the right approach and can assure you, it certainly doesn't encourage me to come back here again. fine if you don't have anything else, but the least you could do is make an effort on the price. fortunately the other person got a room of the same standard as his original booking, so at least one of us did ok..","Singapore, Singapore","TravelAround1809</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",6,2.0

With its impressive light filled atrium and dining area, I thought wow this is going to be good. I was met by the Concierge/Supervisor and was promptly shown to the check in area. Everything there went ok and soon I was up in my room. Again pleasantly surprised. Lovely toiletries, terrific shower, good size room with plenty of light with a modern white twist. Not knowing exactly where it was in relation to the railway station (Tokyo main station for the shinkasen), we took a taxi and it was about a 10 minute ride. I wouldn't recommend walking if you don't like the heat/humidity and have suitcases to contend with as well (this is a personal thing though). Had dinner in the restaurant one night and it was lovely and service was very good. A big shout out to Maharjan Bishal who helped me courier a gift I had for a friend in Tokyo and also Maharjan Rajeshwor (Bellboy) for their assistance. Also their English was impeccable. Something I found lacking in the other hotels that I stayed in whilst in Japan.Whilst I liked the hotel and everything else about it, I'm not sure of the location. It is located in Shinagawa, a bit further south of Tokyo than I thought. You are away from the action and bright lights of Shinjuku/Shibuya/Ginza, however, if you are looking for some peace and quiet, then it's ok. There was a regular free shuttle that stopped outside the hotel to take you to the metro train station if you wanted to which was helpful if you didn't want to walk in the heat and humidity. Just one thing that I thought was odd was that where the shuttle bus dropped you off wasn't where you got it to go back to the hotel. It was on the opposite side of the road which was rather confusing.Also if you are coming from or going to Haneda Airport, the Airport Limousine bus stops right outside the door (will cost you about 720 Yen) and can be booked via the concierge (would suggest the day before you leave) when departing the hotel.Lastly and this was a bit off putting, I was also charged twice for my accommodation. After several emails to the Tokyo Marriott and a phone call to the Marriott Customer Service Centre all was rectified. Other than that, as a hotel for its cleanliness, appearance, staff and service, I would recommend staying there.","Melbourne, Australia","Helen W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",46,4.0

Sadly, we do not know that so we inevitably walk up the hills with our heavy luggage when we first arrive Shinagawa station. There is no time schedule and pick up location from their website until we were told during check-in.We arrive at around 4pm and was greeted to the executive lounge for check in. Staff is friendly and efficient and offer us wet towels (Tokyo is hot!! We are sweating with our heavy luggages!) She also explained the neighbourhood briefly. The executive lounge is small and windowless. We immediately get the room key and back to the room. This time we are staying in the superior corner room. The room is spacious and comfortable, with two big windows overlooking the city and the train rail (somehow guest may find it noisy but we are fine). Those prefer breathtaking view should book a room on high floor, you may also see the Haneda airport if you are lucky enough. We then went to the executive lounge again for the evening cocktail. The lounge is busy and full of people. Luckily we arrived early, otherwise we have to wait for the table. Food and beverage selection is wide and taste is also good. I especially recommend the deep fried beef patty. Food refill is also quick. But the design of the lounge should be improved in some way, at least it should be enlarged to accommodate hotel guests. We then went out for site seeing and returned at mid night. The bed is fresh, smooth and silky. We had a very good sleep. On the following day, we had breakfast in the only restaurant of the hotel, offering buffet breakfast. Again, there is a long queue when it is 9am. But staff is efficient that we are able to get the table in 10 minutes. Food selection is good and I am very happy to have fresh fruit in the buffet (normally I only saw canned or sweetened fruits in hotel buffet). All fruit juices are freshly squeezed, tastes healthy and refreshing. We check out early at around 1100 and take the shuttle again to the station.Overall, the location of the hotel is not perfect, but they have free shuttle. I find it quite different from Osaka Marriott and Nagoya Marriott hotel, in which the other 2 hotels seems to be more large scale in terms of rooms, executive lounge and restaurants. It will be a perfect stay if better guest traffic control can be made.","New York City, New York","porkypugpug</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",61,4.0

It was further annoying when I was told to show my Marriott membership card or tell number if I wanted to use the gym despite having provided my membership details at the time of checking in. Do you expect guests to carry their membership card all the time? And if so, plz be kind enough in mentioning it at the time of booking so that we can go to other properties and not stay with you. Although the place is good, it ruined my entire experience. Have never stayed in any of your properties (or other hotels) across the world so far where a guest is asked to pay for gaining access to swimming pool or gym. If your policies are so strict, you should mention clearly on your website that the hotel doesn't have pool or gym unless you pay extra...that way at least you are not misleading all the guests who expect these basic services which all your other properties or competitive hotels seem to provide....I am really thankful to you for not charging me to use the washroom attached to my room or not asking me to register prior its usage....Worst experience ever!!!!!",mumbai,"Celebrate-Traveling</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>mumbai</strong>",32,1.0

Dinner is much more.The hotel itself is several miles from Ginza, and just about anything else fun to do for that matter. No restaurants close either. It will cost you about 2500 yen, which is about $25 each way in a cab to run down to Ginza district. If comfortable with the trains, then it you could save some money, but will take longer.If you like walking and seeing the beautiful sites in Tokyo, this may not be the ideal choice for you. There are plenty of others closer to the action.Good -- it was slightly cheaper, decent room.

However, since we live in Chiba, just east of Tokyo, I decided to give the Tokyo conterpart a try. While its room was great the bathroom has a tub and take shower inside the tub. While Osaka Marriott has a shower only room and its shower fell from top of the ceiling like Niagara Falls, which is what I like. Now the executive lounge. Tokyo's lounge was about a quarter size of that of Osaka's. A clar win for Osaka. Its wine was not as good as Osaka's. Whiskey was fine. Foods. Clar winner was Osaka. Best food in Tokyo was Takoyaki follwed by Yakisoba. In the afternoon Tokyo offered a tiny Japanese confectionary which was super good but they were so small. One clear advantage for Tokyo was that you could have breakfast buffet at its regular restaurant. I wonder why some of the contributors did not like the idea. Overall, Tokyo Marriott was no match to Osaka. I have been to many Marriott lounges and the Osaka has been clearly the best. But Tokyo Marriott was good too.

We were in town to explore and enjoy the city. The staff was friendly and the room itself was large for Japanese standards. We are gold members so we were able to dine in the lounge after our days touring the city. During check out we mistakenly left our laptop at the front desk. We didn't realize it until we arrived at the airport. We called the hotel and asked them to place the laptop on the airport bus (the method which we traveled to the airport), but they recommended a taxi instead which would cost ~ $200. After much debate, we decided to have the laptop shipped to America. Via email exchange the hotel stated it would cost ~ $80 to ship the laptop. When the package arrived the postage was ~$60, ($20 short of the quoted price) They took advantage of my mistake and profited, poor customer service in my opinion.This entire experience ruined an otherwise good trip.

Ideal location only a 15 minute walk from Shinagawa station connecting us to the rest of Tokyo. Breakfast was really good - and the cook to order menu was very generous. Loved the smoothies.The reason for the 4 star rating was because the administration really made our check in experience uncomfortable. This stay was part of a much larger three week stay across the globe, so as you can imagine a lot of money exchanged hands between multiple properties. To reduce the amount of charges on my credit card while I was away, I prepaid for all of the hotel expenses in advance. This was processed without an issue, but as I'm sure everyone is aware most hotels take an additional amount at checkin to cover additional room charges/expenses such as laundry, room service, restaurant charges etc. I emailed all the hotels I was going to be staying at well in advance to figure out what that amount was going to be. All hotels, including the other ones in Japan, came back very quickly and explained what they would require at checkin for a deposit. I emailed this hotel multiple times and each time I was told that they would not require any amount for incidentals because we had prepaid for the room. When we arrived very late at night after a 10 hr flight, we were told very clearly that we needed to provide a credit card so that they could pre-authorize 50,000 JPY. We were totally unprepared for this requirement and luckily we had a credit card that we could swipe for that kind of an amount, but it certainly was not planned. I realize that this is a country where English is not the first language, but If they can clearly explain it at check in, they can clearly explain in an email prior to arrival to prepare the guest - especially one that is taking as long of a trip as I did.","Hadley, MA","DavidG263</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hadley, MA</strong>",11,4.0

A 10 min stroll from the Shinagawa station will bring you to the hotel. However there is a free regular shuttle service to and fro the hotel from Shinagawa station. The shuttle bus stand is located just outside the Railway station and next to the regular bus stand.Checking in was a breeze. The level of service was good. Our room was located on the 4th floor overlooking a small garden which was fairly pleasant.The room size was good....I have no complaint. The bed is firm and they have a range of pillows on request, subject to availability, including Tempur pillows. I stand corrected but I think the room safe was not available.The toilet / bathroom size was also fairly generous. My only lamentation was the bathtub. I would have preferred a shower tray / cubicle since I am not so young and have to struggle in and out of the bathtub. However there is a small drainage along the edge of the bathtub. This is well thought out to ensure the rest of tbe bathroom is not too wet (even though half the bathtub has a glass panel) to prevent water from splashing out and wetting the toilet which can be annoying.The range of Thann brand of toileteries offered is comprehensive and there is a list of additional toiletries which are not placed in the bathroom eg after-shave lotion, hair clip, etc available on request.Intetestingly the Executive Lounge of this hotel is located at the Lobby level (as opposed to many Exexutive Lounges which are normally at the top or almost top floor). The Executive Lounge is located after the Dining / Lounge area separated by the kitchen just before the Receptionist Counter. The drinks / finger food for afternoon tea and evening cocktails / canapes are reasonable, adequate and tasty. This Executive Lounge does not serve breakfast which is served only in the Dining / Lounge. Breakfast has a respectable variety of offerings, both western and japanese cuisine.

As with others, you are then given what can only be described as a clean, but quite out-dated basic room with a shower over the bath with a curtain. For some bizarre and unknown reason, despite having a spacious Executive Lounge, you can't have breakfast in it. Instead you are told to go to the extremely busy main restaurant where you wait to get a table and are then seated a few centimetres away from other guests. I can't think of another hotel that has an Executive Lounge but does not serve breakfast in it.

We stayed here after Taipei and the experience at this hotel was so different than at the Taipei Marriott (which was fantastic). The hotel is near Shinagawa Station which is big transit hub. There's a shuttle bus that takes you between the hotel and the station; it runs on a fixed schedule and is super convenient during the day and evening. During the times it doesn't run, the station is only an easy 10-15 minute walk away. Shinagawa is actually a pretty convenient place to be - you can get to most major tourist sites from there.As a Platinum, your check-in is handled in the Executive Lounge which is on the lobby floor. The lady gave us the absolute smallest room in the building. All you have to do is take a look at the fire escape map and you can see how small the room is compared to all other ones. As a Marriott Platinum, I expected a much better room. I asked for some fruit and nuts as my Platinum Arrival Gift, and you know what they brought? A bowl of chopped almonds and dried cranberries which was plastic-wrapped. It did not look appetizing at all. Turns out it was the same stuff they serve in the Lounge.After having a terrible night of sleep, we asked to be moved the next morning. They said they'd check but would not promise anything. When we got back later that day, they moved us to a regular room on a non-Club floor but it was at least twice as big. We were staying about 6 days so I asked why we didn't get an upgrade and the excuse was that there were many Golds and Platinums at the hotel... I wonder what those other Platinums are getting.The Executive Lounge has no windows and is a pretty depressing place to hang out in. The good thing is they offer a broad selection of liquors in the evening and they have a lot of bottled water to take away when touring the city.Breakfast is served in the main lobby restaurant. Decent selection of western and eastern food, and they'll make you eggs, omelettes, pancakes, and waffles to order. Service is so-so though - on two days, we had to ask 5 different times for coffee when we were seated (despite the fact that the hostess asked us what we wanted for coffee when she placed us).Overall, this was a pretty standard hotel experience, but I rated them as ""poor"" since we were really not taken care of even though we gave them them several chances to do right by us. I was expecting so much more as a Platinum, but I guess I got spoiled in London and Taipei.","Stockholm, Sweden","calkenneth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",33,2.0

We are Platinum Elite Marriott Rewards members and often feel “valued” by Marriott. But this hotel goes well beyond that of many other hotels (this is often the case when comparing Asian hotels to that of Europe, Australia, and the U.S.). The hotel is located in an office complex, surrounded by a park. It is about a 10-minute walk from a major railroad station – Shinagwawa. There is a shuttle bus to and from the hotel, which runs about every 15 minutes. However, we were very confused the first time and ended up taking a taxi (about $5), because the bus had the name of the building on it, and not the Marriott. That, however, was the only problem we had during our stay. The train station is surrounded by small restaurants, including in the Wing Department store. We were greeted as we walked in the door and taken to register at the executive lounge. The lounge is small and unimpressive, but you have breakfast at the excellent restaurant in the lobby. The breakfast buffet is outstanding. The lounge also has tea service and substantial snacks in the early evening.The rooms (we stayed twice, with a trip to Kyoto between them) were very nice: extremely comfortable, with views over the river. The beds were large and comfortable and the bathroom well appointed, including a heated toilet with a multitude of functions. The rooms have plenty of storage, a safe, bathrobes, slippers, iron (abet, a strange one), and an ironing board. There is an okay fitness club in an attached building, which is free to silver and up elite members. Internet is free to Marriott Rewards members (join there if you're not a member). The quality of the Internet was not great, but overall adequate. As I said, the most impressive feature is the service.

To be fair, they offered to change the room, but it was too late after I was all unpacked and settled in. I was certain that they marketed this property as 100% smoke-free; not sure when it changed.

The hotel was in Shinagawa and was close to the JR station. During my short stay, I didn’t manage to work out how to get to the station on foot as there was no need to. There was a frequent free shuttle bus that transport the guests to and from the Shinagawa JR station daily. On a couple of occasions, I missed the last shuttle bus back to the hotel and resorted to taking a taxi, the maximum damage was 500 JPY so it wouldn’t break the bank if you were out having a good time and were worried about the cost to get back to the hotel from the JR station.I stayed in a hotel room with executive lounge access and it was just wonderful. The lounge was location on the ground floor and there were daily provisions of drinks, snacks and evening canapes. A buffet breakfast was also provided, the food was not in the lounge area but in the main restaurant area. The clever design with the lounge was that there was an inter-connecting door through into the main restaurant to access the breakfast buffet and to bring the food back into the lounge to consume in the quieter environment. Although, if I wanted to sit with the rest of the hotel guests in the main restaurant, I was free to do so too.The room I was provided with was ample sized. In fact, it was bigger than your average Tokyo hotel room. I read reviews that due to the proximity of the JR station, the noise level from the incoming/departing trains were a nuisance and impeded the guests’ hotel experience. Personally, I didn’t notice any such noise level at all. I’m not sure if it were because I was allocated a room on a higher floor.The Concierge were very helpful with my queries on how to reach certain tourist attraction areas. The team were detailed in providing me with the platform number to take the Yamanoto line, the number of stops to my connecting Metro Line, the exit number at my destination etc. Their service was superb.I shall be returning back to this hotel for many reasons such as the ease of connection from the airport, close proximity to the JR Station, well-informed Concierge team and the small but perfectly formed executive lounge area. I have previously stayed in plush hotels near Tokyo Station which offers the same transport connection to Shinagawa. However, I preferred the latter because the station was a lot smaller and not as daunting as Tokyo Station where I spent a great deal of time wandering/milling around the station attempting to find my way out.","London, United Kingdom","MANSUE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",26,5.0

The location, although a bit of a walk from Shinagawa station, is still convenient due to the shuttle that runs between the hotel and the station every 20 minutes. However, note that shuttle stops running around 10:00pm, so if you're getting back after a late night, you'll still be making the 10 minute walk back to the hotel (or take a taxi).Upon arrival, the hotel is very nicely decorated, and everything looks very modern, from the lobby, the bar, and the reception area. The spacious rooms are the same, as it appears that much thought and detail were put into designing the rooms.For some reason, the hotel did not have mobile check-in enabled, even though the reservation shows up on my phone. However, the check-in process was easy when I arrived at night, and I was given my room on the 19th floor.Now, I just have to get into why I was only able to give 4 stars instead of 5, as everything else about the hotel would have been 5 stars. Most Marriott locations can normally see that I am a Platinum Premier member (beyond just Platinum), and most Marriott hotels will give special recognition for it. I was surprised that for being an overseas Marriott, they had no distinction of Platinum Premier, and did not even know what this status was. There was no upgrade in terms of the room (even though it was on a higher floor instead of a lower floor), and I was given the same things that Gold and Platinum members would receive (lounge access, breakfast, one free drink coupon). When I asked which floors were ""Executive Floors"" (to see if I at least was put on an Executive Floor), the front desk staff first checked my room number to protect themselves, and seeing that I was on the 19th floor, replied that the Executive Floors were ""19 and up"". This was entirely not true, as looking from the Marriott website, one can see that Executive Floors are 21 to 23. It is fine if they just told me that no rooms were available for an upgrade, but there was no need to lie about saying that I was on an Executive Floor.I stayed here for 5 nights, and will be taking the 7 day JR pass around Japan. When I return, I will be staying another 3 nights. I'll see if the front desk service is the same when I return.But, aside from that, as I mentioned before, everything in the hotel is great, especially for status members (Gold and up). The breakfast buffet has a wonderful selection of food. The Executive lounge is excellent in the evenings, with a variety of food options and an open self-serve bar.As for the gym, I was actually pretty impressed. They had a great selection of free weights, which one cannot find in every hotel gym. It included a full olympic rack with safety pins, as well as a variety of weight benches. It provided equipment regardless of people's goals, whether it be weight training or just cardio.I'll be looking forward to staying here again.",California,"flipsyde112</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",47,4.0

Rooms are large in comparison to most Tokyo hotels with full bathroom amenities. Staff is helpful but sometimes their English is not as strong as you might require. Breakfast/Dinner is available in the lobby area. Food is expensive, unless you have a breakfast coupon , I would try some of the restaurants near Shinagawa. Be sure to walk through the gardens next door and enjoy the scenery and the Koi pond. Very peaceful. Plenty of restaurants between the hotel and Gotanda station (opposite direction than Shinagawa)Agree on the comment about hotel gym.

This may be harsh and to be clear, this is comparing to Japanese level of hospitality. A business trip and despite pre-arrangement via my director's personal assistant, a room was not ready by 4pm when we wanted to manage a quick check-in before a meeting with Japanese clients at 5pm. And we thought Punctuality is a virtue. Acceptable of company VISA credit card depends on who is managing the POS system. Credit card rejected at check-in by a new staff member despite a complaint from us that the same credit card is accepted at the main check-in counter when used by another colleague. We also called the credit card hotline to make sure the card was okay and they verified not trace of a transaction was not submitted. Eventually found someone else on check-out day to sort it out.Nobody was outside the lobby area to help with taxis. When the person on duty came, he just stood comfortably inside. We had passerby from the park next to the hotel cutting in to steal our taxis while we waited in the hotel, so we had to stand outside in the cold to get our taxi. Not an example of omotenashi at all.A big commotion about losing 3 limousine bus tickets that were issued. As the tickets was lost during breakfast somewhere in the lobby about 45 minutes they were issued, went back to the counter and had to pay the fare for 3 pax again. As there was evidence of payment and number records, not sure why hotel cannot speak to the limousine bus company and ask for waiver to show ticket, especially when we had the hotel printed confirmation (we just did not had the tickets as being small, they got misplaced after breakfast)Ordering a coffee ala carte during a morning business meeting at the lobby area took 2 tries. And after it took so long, I walked up to the window where the brewed coffee was and spoke to the guy inside myself.Location was not as good as the other hotels nearer to ginza or those beside shinagawa station. So the higher price it commanded does not seem sensible.As this is our managing director's first visit to Japan, I feel embarrassed about the standards of hospitality shown.P.S.

Recently, I stayed at Tokyo Marriott in Shingawa to try. I am a platinum member here as well. Here is my honest comparison.RoomsMarriott is more updated than the Hyatt. For the money, you are probably better off with Marriott.Location:Hyatt is in Shinjuku which is very central and you can access Tokyo much easier than Shinagawa where the Marriott is. Shinagawa is a bit out (15 min) from the real cenral Tokyo but not far. Both hotel has shuttle bus from the station. Nothing around the Marriott but many restaurants, shops etc, very close to the Hyatt. So for location Hyatt is the winner unless you are doing business close to Shinagawa area.Regency Club - Executie loungeThe Marriott lounge is hands down better than the Hyatt. Hyatt has a nice acceptable breakfast at the lounge but the Marriott breakfast is at the restaurant which has significantly more variety. Marriott has high tea in the afternoon with numerous cakes, sandwiches, scones, danish and Japanese sweets. Hyatt has cookies and pound cake. In this area, Marriott wins hands down. For the evening spread, both hotel has free drinks. Wine, beer, champaign, etc. So drinks are comparible. However, for the food, Marriott makes Hyatt look pretty bad. Marriott has numerous dishes (6-7) and it is constantly being refilled. The quality is also excellent in my opinion. Compared to Marriott, Hyatt Regency Tokyo's evening spread is cheese, crackers, nuts and one plate of food with 3-4 small peices of things. Only one plate per person. The quality is also a problem. It is not very good. So if you are looking for a lounge with ample offering, I would avoid the Hyatt and go for Marriott. The only draw back of Marriott lounge is the size. It is not a very big lounge where the Hyatt lounge is large.Staff and service.Both hotel has good service and staff are very nice. PricePrice is comparable at both properties.Elite membersIf you are top tier member, you will be allowed lounge access. For the room upgrade, you will probably get an upgrade if you are Diamond or Platinum but don't expect a significant upgrade from either hotel.All in allIf location is important, then Hyatt may be better unless you need to be in the Shingawa area. However, if perks such as lounge quality is an important factor, Marriott wins hands down.","Tokyo Prefecture, Japan","Expat T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo Prefecture, Japan</strong>",42,4.0

The lobby bar has a standard menu, no sushi or other traditional japanese meals, but you can easily catch a taxi and have a ride wherever you wish, there are plenty of sushi bars around.

This stay however was not. Despite being winter and off-season with the hotel nearly empty, the only room for my stay was one very small room right over the most frequented rail lines. When I requested a room change I was provided a quieter room with lights and electricity that didn't work when I arrived and a broken shower. Dining in the hotel restaurant was not much better. Despite a fairly empty Monday night, the only table was by the host stand and kitchen access. I probably could've gotten over that except the Chef's treat that night was small glasses of shrimp covered in red sauce. One of the waiters of course dropped a tray full of the glasses and the result was red sauce all over the legs of my trousers. 2 breakfast occasions where I was asked if I wanted coffee or tea and both occasions that order was promptly forgotten.

So suggest to change it to a real drawer or put a anti slippy mat under the tray to avoid it fall down when guests pull it out from the cabinet.

She asked if i have touch anything in the room and i said no. And i mean really no. i only opended the door and then i went down. She told me to wait at the room and someone will come and escort me and i gave her back the previous room keys.And the bigger surprise came. Her colleague came quite promptly and helped us w our luggage. Before we leave the room she went in and inspected all the mini bar and bathroom to make sure we really did not 'touch anything'.

We selected the Tokyo Marriott because usually they are a good choice. That was our mistake. The room size was ok but the lighting was poor and there were NO drawers. How would you like to live out of suitcases?? In addition, there wasn't an English speaking concierge. We were going on a cruise and no one could help us locate the port. We finally figured it out on our own. We were not told that the Marriott provided shuttle service to the train station and shopping. That was unacceptable. The restaurant was very good for breakfast and dinner. Don't take the tours. Don't expect English on the television. It was quite limited and variable.  If we were to return to Tokyo , we would select a hotel in the Ginza district . It cost $40 plus from the Marriott. Also, be prepared to spend more for clothing than in the good old USA.  Lastly, take a shuttle from the Narita airport. We paid $195 for two. Taxis and private cars were much more because it takes 1&1/2 to 2 hours .

The location isn't great, however, there is a bus that takes you to Ropponge in about 20 minutes. I arrived with two heavy suitcases and a laptop bag, so I was hoping that there would be helpful staff waiting at the entrance to the hotel - I was wrong. I then had to drag everything myself to the reception, through the restaurant as the layout is very strange. The staff in general were nonchalant and not service focused. An example was when I went for dinner at the restaurant and was told that I couldn't sit at one of the numerous empty tables on my own and that I had to sit in an uncomfortable high chair at the bar and under strong lights. I was amazed at how rude they were. Being hungover and desperate for food I had no other option, but to sit at the bar, across from the blender that used pretty regularly. If the hotel was in a better location I would have just ate out. Before staying here, I spent over a month in the Marriott in Nagoya and it's like night and day in comparison, to the extent that it's embarrassing how polite and helpful the staff were. I genuinely can't believe this is a Marriott. The rooms are reasonably new, but pretty small, with a really strange lowered ceiling over the shower leaving not much space between my head and the ceiling - I'm only 6ft1. The bed was actually pretty comfortable: big king size. There's a Nesspresso machine in the room, which is nice. On the whole the rooms are ok, but I was facing the train tracks and it's constant traffic. I won't be staying in this hotel ever again and I'd recommend people to stay well clear. The food was average, the service was nonexistent and unfriendly. The quality of the room is the only thing that brings it up to a 2* rating and even at that, I've had better rooms in lesser quality hotels for a fraction of the price. ",,Stephen R,6,2.0

Our room was modern, had comfortable beds, large oversized bathroom and a great selections of coffee and tea. My room was on a high floor but I could still hear the train at times. As a gold member, I was able to use the executive lounge. The lounge offered a variety of food/drinks and was the best part of the hotel. The concierge desk helped me map out different sights. CONS- I was disappointed to have to pay to use the pool. I feel as a rewards member, that the pool should be free. The pool has quite a bit of rules that were annoying. At check in, the desk did not want to give me access to the lounge because I was not traveling with my husband. They did finally agree because my name is on the reservation. There is an attitude in Japan that it is not acceptable for a woman to travel without her husband. I encountered this several times in Japan. Please note that you can get a shuttle bus for free rom the Shinagawa station- stop #6.Easy to get to/from Narita using the Narita Express.

Compared to a number of decent options in Shinagawa the rate was kind of overpriced given that there are decent and cheaper options right next to Shinagawa station (e.g. Excel, Prince, Strings).Many reviews have noted the hotels location and it is definitely not that convenient. While there is a shuttle bus to and from the station the last bus from the station departs at 9:55pm so if you have a late night out then you have to walk 10 minutes uphill or get a taxi for 700+ yen. Also, the shuttle is not exclusively for guests but is shared with the office workers next door to the hotel, So the shuttle can be packed, especially on the down trip after 6pm. So while the hotel would be a good base to explore Tokyo in theory because you can practically get to anywhere from Shinagawa station, it is not really that practical.About the hotel itself, it is part of a bigger building complex so the layout is unconventional. Rather than entering through a lobby one has to walk a while before getting to the front desk. In any case, the rooms are well-sized and typical Marriott quality and standard that are comparable to Marriotts in the US. A major plus is having access to the Executive lounge which is open till midnight and offers a range of food options throughout the day, such as afternoon tea and evening snacks. Breakfast is taken at the hotel's one solitary restaurant, which finishes at 11 am, a plus for late sleepers. Added to this are host of other benefits such as welcome drink and complementary pressing, as well as a 'guaranteed' late checkout of 4pm. This sounded good but the two airport shuttles to Haneda Airport leave at around 9am and 11am, so while we did take advantage of the late checkout we took a taxi to Haneda, which came to 4000 yen. But of course, I only received the benefits on the cheap rate because of my Gold Elite. I could not imagine how much an Executive level room will cost.Service levels at the hotel were mixed. Staff at the restaurant and lounge were exemplary. Bell section was another matter. On both occasions my taxi arrived and there was no staff at the entrance. The first time, the taxi driver helped get a trolley for our 3 suitcases. The second time I had to personally get the trolley and unload and load myself. Only later did some staff belatedly came out. As I told the staff in the lounge: ""Once can be an accident, but two times is something more systematic"", and I asked for the name card of the General Manager. I do not normally mind these kinds of things but I did not pay Marriott price to get Courtyard level service.All in all, this is a good hotel for business execs with Marriott Gold/Plat Elites. Otherwise, there are many more options available for the price.","Hong Kong, China","Michael C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",118,3.0

We were met at the entrance and tended to until we got to our rooms and had our bags dropped off. Complimentary drink coupons and breakfast buffets were also provided, although these were only for two people. Can't complain after all the service I received. The location worked very well for us. It was an easy train using the Narita Express to get to the Shinagawa station. I followed the directions using a previous post to find the shuttle bus (exit the Tanakawa side and head left when you get outside) and was at the hotel just a few minutes later. The Marriott provided easy access to the city via Shinagawa station. It helps to know the shuttle bus schedule, which the hotel will provide if you ask, but even the walk is only about 10-15 minutes.

Although Tokyo is a large city and it will be hard to find the perfect place, hotel's location is not ideal for discovering the city. You spend a lot of time travelling if you want to visit the main sights. Hotel & Rooms:Upon arrival, my first impression of the hotel was not very positive. The layout of the main lobby is very unusual for a hotel. Bell desk is right at the main entrance, but the main reception is on the opposite side of the ground floor, away from the main entrance and you have to walk pass the restaurant for check-in. Firstly, we stood slightly confused at the entrance, as we did not know where to go and it took a couple of minutes for the staff to realise and direct us to the right location. The reception area is hidden in the corner and does not make the justice for the hotel. Dark and without nice vibe. My negative comments will end at this point, as once you checked into your room, the positive experience starts. The rooms are bright and spacious with large and comfortable beds. If you receive a room on a higher floor you will also appreciate beautiful city view. The bathroom is also spacious and well designed, with amenity box, which exceeds any expectations and which definitely provides everything you might need in case you forgot your cosmetic bag. Service and cleanliness:Overall the staff is very friendly and efficient. The concierge patiently explained us the best way to reach our desired destinations and also provided some personal suggestions. Upon departure we needed large taxi, for which we would needed to wait 1 hour. One of the bellboys did not hesitate and went out and tried to bring a taxi from the street, which thankfully worked and we got the taxi we needed after 15 minutes. During the breakfast the staff kept the tables clean and the buffet was refilled regularly. The cleanliness in the rooms, as well as public areas is spotless. Restaurants:We have dined only in the main lobby restaurant, which also serves the main breakfast. Breakfast buffet offers nice variety of Japanese and international dishes. It is nicely laid out and the quality is one of the best I experienced in a hotel. Many hotels offer larger selection, but the quality suffers, which is definitely not the case her. Overall:A part from the badly designed lobby, the hotel ticks all the boxes. Nice and spacious rooms, good service, friendly and efficient staff, attention to detail and cleanliness make this hotel really good choice for traveler. The re-designing of the lobby might not the top priority for the hotel management, but it should be something to consider for future to make this nice hotel even better.","Lipany, Slovakia","Lipany</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lipany, Slovakia</strong>",22,4.0

But this hotel grows on you, the longer we stayed here, the more we came to love it. The customer service is top notch here, especially Yuri Ebisuno at the lounge. Yuri was so patient and sweet with us, she helped us almost everyday, any question, any problem. We had an incident in the hotel where I got a cut on the leg, Yuri and Mr. Shigehisa Hirasawa stepped in, and resolved the problem right away. Thank you Ms. Yuri & Mr. Shigehisa!!

While the Prince Sakura is a closer walk to Shinagawa Station, the Marriott has an executive lounge, so I picked the Marriott. (I went with my parents, and they always look forward to going to the lounge when they travel with me.) Before I talk about the hotel, I’m going to cover getting around to and from the hotel. Normally I don’t go into this much detail in my reviews, but for someone new to the area, this information would’ve been immensely helpful to me had I known ahead of time. If you want to go straight to the review of the hotel itself, skip the next two paragraphs.The hotel is pretty easy to get to from the airport. We arrived in Haneda (HND), bought PASMO cards, and took a direct train to Shinagawa Station on the Keikyu Line. When you exit the station, make a left and then another left on the sidewalk along the side of the station. At this point, you can either walk to the hotel (about 1/2 a mile, and you’ll see it to the right before you get to the next intersection) or catch the shuttle. The frequency of the shuttle varies depending on time of day and day of the week, and it doesn’t run very late, so you may want to ask the hotel for the schedule if you plan on taking it to the hotel prior to check-in. Note that the shuttle is actually a bus which runs between Shinagawa Station and Gotenyama Trust City (where the Marriott is located) and you don’t have to pay even though it is equipped to accept payments. (See below for a picture of the stop.) We didn’t realize the shuttle was actually a bus, so the first time we tried to take it, we waited as few came and went thinking the shuttle to the hotel would look different.It took a day or so to get the hang of going to and from the hotel, since I wasn’t familiar with Tokyo. What threw me off was that the rail system is operated by multiple public and private companies, and the Tokyo Metro app that I downloaded didn’t cover Shinagawa Station in its routing. (I have no affiliation with Tokyo Metro, but I recommend the app as it works offline and tells you which stations are nearby. You can find a download link on their site.) While you may come up with a better strategy, here’s what I used to get around: When heading out for the day go to the Central Entrance of Shinagawa Station and get on the Yamanote Line. This line is a ring around Tokyo and you can either get to where you want to go or transfer to the line to get you where you want to go from here. (FYI, the Yamanote Line isn’t in the Tokyo Metro app either.) Coming back, I would either take the Yamonote Line back to Shinagawa, or I’d use the Tokyo Metro app to get to the Asakusa Line (Sengakuji Station - A07 if you have to pick a stop). From there you can transfer to a “Haneda Airport Limited Express” train which will stop at Shinagawa Station. If you get on a train that stays on the Asakusa Line, the next stop (Takanawadai Station - A06) is about a mile walk back to the hotel, and there’s no shuttle from there.Now on to the hotel. The room was very clean and quiet and visited by housekeeping twice a day. The light controls for the whole room (except for the bathroom) were only on the headboard, so while you could control all the lights from bed (including a floor light which functioned as a nightlight), you couldn’t turn off the lights on your way out—something I always make a habit of doing in hotels. What stood out though was the TOTO Washlet toilet seat in the bathroom. This was my first experience with one of these and I won’t go into details, but the photo below of the control panel speaks for itself. Suffice it to say that a European bidet can’t hold a candle to this thing. (No pun intended.)The Executive Lounge is located on the first floor of this hotel and is open from 6:00 AM to midnight daily. They offer soda, coffee, tea, and snacks all day long as well as breakfast, afternoon tea, and a light evening meal. They also have a full open bar in the evening with wine and liquor (see pic below). It’s worth noting that they do stick to the rule of limiting admission to the Elite Member and one guest. Of all the Marriott hotels that I've visited, this was the first one that was strict about admission into the lounge. While disappointing to hear, I can understand. The lounge isn’t very large and did fill up during peak times, but I was always able to find a seat. Unfortunately this meant I had to bring my parents in one at a time. (They were staying in a different room, so their key wouldn’t get them in.)Instead of eating breakfast in the lounge, I preferred to join my parents, so I opted for breakfast coupons in the hotel restaurant, Lounge & Dining G. I highly recommend going this route whether you have lounge access or not because the breakfast options are much better in the restaurant. There’s a bar for ordering eggs, waffles, and pancakes, an area where you can select a Japanese breakfast (including noodle soup customized to your liking), a bread bar, a fruit bar, a cereal bar, a selection of juices, a selection of cheeses, and probably more that I'm missing. You can easily stay here for a week and have something different every day.All in all, we had a wonderful stay at this hotel. If you’re looking for a place that’s not in the busiest part of Tokyo with easy access to both local trains and the Shinkansen, you can’t go wrong here.","West Chester, Pennsylvania","Manta230</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>West Chester, Pennsylvania</strong>",12,5.0

The hotel is really easy to find- about 15/ 20 minutes drive from Haneda airport and a 5 minute walk from Shinagawa station. The hotel itself is very nicely decorated and spacious. We stayed in a twin room on one of the higher floors and the room was huge with a tv, seating area and really big marble bathroom. The bar downstairs is really ambient and cool looking. The food is gorgeous and the drinks were fabulous. There's a great breakfast buffet with different stations for things like pancakes, omelettes and waffles etc. The staff were very friendly and kind and spoke very good English. They greeted us with a big smile and a hello every day. I would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Tokyo on business. For a holiday and if you are looking to go out partying, somewhere closer to Shinjuku/Shibuya etc might be better (as the trains don't run throughout the night and taxis are very expensive!)All in all a wonderful stay though and I would definitely go back :) ","Dublin, Ireland","737flyyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin, Ireland</strong>",22,4.0

Our room was very comfortable and extremely quiet as per our request. The staff went out of there way to help in any way possible despite our language barriers. We ate in house a few times for breakfast, lunch and dinner and each time were very impressed. Breakfast is available buffet and Alacarte which not all hotels offer and they have a small section to buy bakery goods and takeaway coffee. The lunch menu is extensive and served most of the day with typical fare of burgers and pasta, again excellent. There are three restaurants but our favourite was the grill where we shared a latter of wonderful grilled meat, ribs and prawns all cooked perfectly. The staff were fantastic and we'll trained, if we couldn't make ourselves understood there was someone else to try. Remember we are the visitors so have patience.There is a bus every few minutes to shuttle you free of charge to Shinagawa station or if you feel adventurous walk to Kita shinagawa station nearby and ride to Shinagawa in one stop. Alternatively it's a 10 minutes walk.Highly Recommended ","Clifton Hill, Australia","larrysbisa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clifton Hill, Australia</strong>",163,5.0

The property is clearly geared towards the business crowd and was perfectly appointed for that crowd.Unfortunately for us, we were traveling on pleasure and arrived to the property after 24 hours of constant travel from a 45 minute wooden boat ride to a 75 minute ferry to the mainland, followed by another 75 minute plane ride to an hour airport transfer and then additional 10 hour flight to Tokyo. Clearly we were exhausted and upon arrival at 9am to the hotel our rooms were not available. I had already emailed the reservations department the week prior to request an early check in (in addition to my comments when booking the reservations 5 months in advance) however it was not until the day before my arrival (travel day) that I received the answer that our request could not be accommodated. We even tried using our Marriott Platinum Rewards member status to see if that would at least get one of our rooms available earlier than the standard check in so we could shower and change, but no luck!We were however, offered use of the gym facilities and showers downstairs for a charge ($25 USD per person) at that point we just needed a shower to regain some energy and continue on our day so we caved in and paid the fee. I must say that the shower facilities themselves were a cultural experience. There are no private enclosed shower stalls - it was an open shower with the hot tub in the middle and sauna at one end of the pavilion along with some stool and hand held shower hoses. I will spare the details and leave it at the fact that it was an interesting experience. My fiance and the boyfriend of our friend that we were traveling with even shared a shave with a group of Japanese men in their locker room - again great cultural experience. After our showers and quick cat-nap in the lobby our tour guide met us around 11 am and we got out to explore the city. When we returned to the hotel that evening around 11pm our bags had been delivered to our rooms and we were able to settle in for the night. The rooms were perfectly appointment for our purpose, bed and clean shower facilities. Safe was large enough to accommodate our necessities. It may have been the exhaustion but that night I slept perfectly and we awoke the following day continue our exploration of Tokyo and attend the car show which first spurred our trip to the East. On the last night of our trip we were over all the fried rice, noodles and sushi we had consumed in the previous 10 days of travel and decided to have a burger at the bar - by far one the best burgers we have had! The tomato bisque was equally delicious and warmed you from the inside out! Unfortunately I cannot recall anyone by name from the hotel at this point but we enjoyed our stay in Tokyo. Tips - there is a market and post office on the main floor at the hotel where you can stock up on refreshments and snacks, as well as ship out any souvenirs and extra purchases you may have made on the trip in order to avoid the extra baggage fees.","Nassau, New Providence Island","ChristineB86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nassau, New Providence Island</strong>",12,4.0

The breakfast restaurant in the morning was busy with business travelers so you need to ensure you give yourself time. The buffet was just ok, there was a lot of cold food like the bacon (every morning I was there) and having to order eggs even just scrambled caused a very long wait. I think the breakfasts can be improved by keeping the food under lights or something. The gym is very large but full of equipment that must be 20 years old, this needs an urgent upgrade.

Also the floor is sprung wood so running on the machine sounds terrible and you have to geeeently put the weights down before you squeeze them back in the rack. The pool is suuuuper - about 15usd extra but worth it if you like lap swimming. Lounge closes at midnight till 6am....Not far to the train station, overland to shinjuku in 20 mins. A great, spotlessly clean hotel with great staff. 24 hour gym and lounge would make it a 5+ star hotel in my view.",,Rufus W,5,4.0

Bed was also kind of hardStaffs were cold, not warm and very robotic. Again, not expected of a marriot service level received from marriot staff. The only thing we are thank full for is that the hotel was willing to keep our luggage for a few days while we are away to other cities and we came back to recieve the luggage again. Thank you for that. I think this is the saviour bit. I am usually very loyal to your brand, am also a marriot vacation club member for few years already but after this stay, am really questioning if this would be the standard we would receive for future marriot?","Singapore, Singapore","Krisbelle</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",29,3.0

Robes and slippers are included in the room as well, but you get one bath towel per person and you must ask if you need another one.

Overall, this is a nice Marriott, about what one would expect in terms of a Marriott located in Asia. If you are looking for a hotel that is attached to Shinagawa station, I would recommend the Intercontinental Strings.Getting here: I find that the best way to get to Shinagawa station is to take the Narita Express from the Narita Airport which is a single stop before arriving at Shinagawa Station. The cost is about ¥3,190 but you can buy a round trip if you have a foreign passport and expect to return within 30 days for ¥4,000 – a bargain! The train has a single stop prior to arrival in Shinagawa station and takes approximately 1 hour for the journey. Compared to a taxi (I have done this and would NEVER recommend it unless you are made of money) or the Bus (also highly recommended, but it can be caught in traffic) I prefer the Narita Express. Exit the station at the Takanawa Exit (going AWAY from the Konan entrance) and take a left on the main street when you see the McDonalds and Wings department store. Walk about 5 minutes up the street, crossing to the right at the hill, and keeping the Marriott sign in your line of sight for an additional 5 minutes. It takes less than 10 minutes if you walk fairly quickly, and is a nice walk. As a side note, the grocery store in the basement of Wings is a great place to pick up food, drinks, supplies and I use it for sushi on the run. There is a food court in the basement as well that is reasonably priced. Of course, Shinagawa station has a large number of food courts and places to buy drinks. The Marriott is a “standard” Marriott in terms of rooms. It is more modern than the U.S. centric Marriott’s – what I liked about it was the air conditioning was cold if you set it lower, and the drapes kept the light out for those of us with jet lag. The Gold/Platinum executive lounge is on the first floor next to check in (not common) and you will receive coupons to eat breakfast in the main restaurant if you have the Gold/Platinum status. Overall, this is a nice hotel, but is a bit more out of the way with respect to Shinagawa Station. I have also stayed at the Prince hotel (I like the Marriott better) and the Intercontinental Strings located at the station (similar quality, and better location for transportation). If you don’t care about points, and the price is the same, I think the Intercontinental Strings is a better choice. Regarding the distance from the Marriott to the Station, I found it to be a pleasant walk, uphill to the hotel, downhill to the Station – a good brisk 10 minutes in the morning or evening was a pleasant walk and very straightforward.",Chicago,"ordflyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago</strong>",218,4.0

I found the service at the Tokyo Marriott to be a little “cool” compared to the other properties on our Japan visit, but generally they stay was comfortable and pleasant.The Tokyo Marriott is located within a 10 minute walk of Shingawa station. For those travelling with JR Rail passes, this is extremely convenient as it is served by the JR Yamanote line which allows travel with the JR Rail pass. There is a free bus that goes between Shingawa and the Marriott that runs every 20 minutes, and is located street-side (the shelter does contain a sign for the Marriot, and this is a city-bus not a typical hotel shuttle).","Toronto, Canada","59anthonyn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",58,4.0

Our experience was excellent. The staff was very friendly and almost everyone spoke good English. No need to worry about that if you're concerned about the language barrier. They were also good about allowing us to speak Japanese as much as we could and didn't just assume we only spoke English. Our room was huge and on the 20th floor with views of Tokyo Bay, the shinkansen train station and (if you looked carefully) the Rainbow Bridge. The breakfast was excellent with lots of western and Japanese choices on the buffet along with made-to-order eggs, waffles and ""pancakes"". We couldn't even keep up with the offers of refills on our coffee. We also enjoyed using the late night drink coupon in the lobby bar. As the room was booked by our Japanese friends, I'm not sure if that is included for everyone or not. It was a great way to end our hot days of sightseeing. I also enjoyed getting a copy of the Japan Times at my door each morning.There is a complimentary city bus-type shuttle from Shinagawa station that will take you to the hotel/office complex several times an hour. Honestly I was expecting something a little more luxurious at this price point than a city bus but it got us where we needed to go. It does stop running fairly early (around 9pm?). If you don't want to bother with the shuttle, the charge for a taxi to the hotel from Shinagawa station is within the basic fare of 730 yen and takes about 5 minutes. It may have even fallen within the ""short fare"" category at 560 yen. The Airport Limousine Bus stops at this hotel making it a seemless connection to/from Narita and Haneda airports. It was nice not to lug bags on and off the subway or train! There were just a couple minor annoyances to keep in mind:1. Wi-Fi is not included in the room charge. I know this is a Marriott ""thing"" and kind of standard at big dollar, corporate hotels but it is annoying to not automatically have wi-fi when the room costs so much! As our friends were treating us to the hotel stay, I did not want to run up their bill by tacking on wi-fi charges. It became difficult to keep up on communication and checking schedules without it. We stayed at hotels a third of this price during our trip where wi-fi was complimentary. 2. There is no public place to print an airline boarding pass. When I asked at the desk, I was told to email my boarding pass to the front desk and they would print it. As I did not have wi-fi (see above), this was impossible. Finally after much discussion and phone calls, I was led into the executive center where I was allowed to use the computer to check in and print my passes myself.

When I entered the hotel and indicated I was checking in, the bellman asked my name and then sent me down a long hallway to reception. Not sure why he asked my name . . . it's not as if he communicated it to reception.Check-in was quick and my room was ready. The 3 elevators are small and in the back of the hotel -- not exactly what you'd expect -- but were reasonably prompt. The room was decent in size with a bed, settee and round table that doubles as a desk. Furnishings are very modern and look exactly like the website, though the actual room seems smaller than the picture would indicate. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom has been modernized other than (as others have said), the tub, which really does look 1970s. Bath amenities include almost anything you could want/expect and were replenished twice daily. Shower pressure was excellent. Stayed on a high floor and had no noise issues.Executive Lounge was nice. Not huge so could become crowded but it wasn't when I was there. Plentiful food and beverages with a combination of self-serve and folks who will serve you; this works quite well. Breakfast was quite a spread -- almost anything you could ask for including cooked-to-order eggs and other Western fare as well as Asian items. Service was impeccable. Ate dinner at the Japanese restaurant. Food was excellent and the service very prompt. The menu is a bit limited compared to a US Japanese restaurant in that there are several multi-course meals and then a few a la carte items. It's thus not easy to pick and choose what you want to eat, although you might be able to make special requests (though servers don't speak much English). Prices aren't cheap but there also aren't many options in the local area.There is no pool or fitness center on site, although they provide information on a nearby fitness facility that was free of charge, although it may not be free to every traveler.Overall, this was a perfectly fine hotel and I had no complaints. However, it lacked the special extras to make me give it 5 stars.

Many elements of our stay were 5* and and if it wasn't for the less than perfect sleep I would not hesitate to give 5* overall. Arrival was great (it is a shortish walk from Shinagawa station; there is also a shuttle bus); they called ahead from the entrance and someone was already waiting for us at the executive lounge (which surprisingly is on the ground floor) to check us in. The executive lounge in that sense is a bit awkward and there appears to be limited access checks through the day with folks just walking in. Service in the lounge and offerings through the day were nice; food in the evening seemed decent and plentiful, but we only ate there once. If you have access to the EL you also get free breakfast in their main restaurant which features a nice buffet with Japanese and Western fare.The hotel room was nicely refurbished but very small (no upgrade given :( ) which was o.k. since we weren't planning to stay in the room much at all. What I just can't understand is the window situation; they completely refurbed everything and they are not putting in better windows? The hotel is right above the Tokyo-Osaka Shinkansen line and there is a train pretty much every minute. If you are a light sleeper, this can be a problem. I slept o.k.ish with ear plugs, but it was still disturbing during the night. The other part where they ?? ran out of money ?? was the bathroom where half looked nice/modern and refurbished and the other half with the bathtub looked like the 70s. They must have spent quite a bit of money on redoing all the rooms and it is such a pity that the bathrooms did not get fully upgraded and the windows are not better.At the right price, and we got a pretty good deal, this hotel is great for Tokyo stays especially when you plan on using public transportation and day trips using Japan rail pass.

Finally.As Marriott Platinum members, and despite booking a regular room with points, we were upgraded to a Club room, which was very nice.We chose 500 points as a Platinum gift, but also received a lovely plate with gorgeous looking cookies in our room.The room itself was pretty spacey, with a rather simplistic design and a view towards the port.The beds and couch were very comfy.There was a huge safe in one of the drawers, where even a big laptop fitted with ease.The bathroom was very nice, although it only had a bath (no shower).Water pressure was very good.The amenities were outstanding (Thann and Aromatherapy).Naturally, the toilet included a hi-tech automated bidet, which is regular in Japan.The hotel had no gym nor pool on site. Instead, you can buy access to a nearby old-looking gym (apx. 20 USD). This is pretty sad, actually, as you'd think the hotel would've reached some agreement with the gym to allow access to its guests.There's a a convenient 7/11 just next to the hotel with decent prices.The hotel offers a free shuttle bus service to Shinagawa station (ask the reception/concierge for the timetable).The shuttle from Shinagawa station to the hotel leaves from bus stop number 6 – just exit Shinagawa station from the Takanawa exit, turn left and walk apx. 50 meters.The one place the hotel demonstrates a 5-star level is the Club lounge.The lounge is rather oddly located next to the reception, in a window-less room (which is not an issue at all).The club features an extensive full buffet breakfast, which is served in the hotel's restaurant (superb selection!), all day nibbles, including cakes and pastries and an amazing dinner presentation, which includes over half a dozen hot dishes, sweets, soft drinks, good quality alcohol and huge cakes and pastries.Being a Marriot Platinum (or Gold) is certainly worthwhile for hotel guests, as you receive both Club access and a full buffet breakfast.All in all, despite the somehow painful check-in process, we had an enjoyable stay.","Tel Aviv, Israel","TheShis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",3190,4.0

Public areas all recently renovated, hotel is an easy 12 minute walk or a shuttle is periodically available (cab 720 yen). Walk in the front door and a bellman greets me, learns my name, and escorts me into the Concierge lounge for check-in. As others note, the first floor lounge is oddly-sited and has no windows, a bit of a downer in an otherwise bright and air-y lobby. However its proximity next to the restaurant made it easy to take the great coffee from their machine while enjoying complimentary breakfast in the lobby restaurant. Upgraded to a nice suite on top floor with sweeping views. Entry way has a wonderful art-niche, but there's nothing there - silk flower arrangement or a painting/litho should be placed there. I'm also staring at two nicely finished doors, but its not clear where the room is...one door to a bathroom, another to the suite. The suite has a large desk, sitting area and a flat-screen that can be positioned towards the bed or sitting areas. There are two balcony's outside the room, but they are only accessible from the fire escape; no doors to the balconies. Windows aren't just double-paned; there's two sets of windows to ensure that no exterior noise gets in the room, though the neighborhood location means most of the noise might come from the trains running in/out of shinagawa station. Removeable remote control for the blinds. Bed is insanely comfy for a Marriott - my best nights' sleep of the week. No artwork at all in the room - lots of wall space but nothing on them. Makes the room seem more industrial (maybe primarily for meetings?) and less home-y. Open another door to part of the bathroom - a large and well-lit sink, and a make-up area..but there isn't a chair at the make-up mirror, and no chairs in the room would fit there. Yet another door takes you into the spacious room housing the walk-in shower, washlet/toilet, and tub. The shower only had a wall-mounted wand shower, and as the moisture built-up in the shower, the wand would slide down the pole and I'd have to push or hold it over my head. Would expect a room of this stature would have a fixed wall or ceiling mounted fixture in addition to the wand.Staff was very friendly throughout the hotel. Bought some fish at Tsukiji and they offered to keep it in their industrial freezers until check-out. Enrollee to the train station I realized that i left my phone in my room...when I walked back into the hotel and said that I forget my phone, the bell-lady was waiting for me, knew my name and quickly returned with my phone and charger in a shrink-wrapped bag. Great hospitality.All in all a wonderful stay where everyone made me feel welcomed.

If you're visiting Tokyo for work, this property will do as it is close to a conference center and some major corporations. However, if you're in Tokyo for leisure, look elsewhere. The location is not really convenient for a tourist. Further, while Marriott has made an effort to update the property, it lacks wow factor and the rooms and common areas are generally nondescript. My spouse is a Marriott gold level member and we were given a room about 175 square feet. The bed took up almost the entire room. The staff is relatively friendly. However, I'll note that when I asked for a dinner recommendation, the only suggestion I was given was the restaurant in the hotel. Really? Tokyo is the largest city in the world and I was in a lounge that is supposed to cater to the frequent traveler and the best/only restaurant that I can be steered to is the one in the hotel.

The rooms that I had seemed standard Marriott size. Updated rooms with blt in HDTV on wall, large King bed. Nice views of city. We had lounge access where staff again was very friendly and helpful. The lounge provides hot Hors d'oeuvre wine, champagne, beer, hard liquor and great deserts. My only complaint with the lounge is that they don't seem to vary the hot hors d'oeuvres. Usually teriyaki chicken and pork skewers, fois gras. The buffet breakfast in the dining room is quite sufficient. You can have made to order omelets, waffles with real maple syrup from Canada, not the imitation stuff that restaurants substitute, miso soup with additions, fresh juices, hot lemonade, cappuccino, latte, coffee, all with coffee syrups like peppermint, plus cold cuts and various breads and rolls. When I first got to the hotel I walked from Shinagawa station, about 10 min. Later I learned there is a free city bus shuttle which is very easy to find outside Shinigawa station and stops directly in front of Marriott. We took JR train around Tokyo which is at Shinagawa. Also Norita Express stops there as does the Haneda train. Haneda airport would be my choice as it is the city airport,. much closer than Narita. The major attractions of Tokyo are not walking distance from the Hotel, such as Ginza, Disneyland, Akiabara, but with JR train, it doesn't matter as you can get there quickly.

It's calming, but does not exude excitement, if that's what you are looking for. The staff is very nice and helpful, without being intrusive. The hotel is in a quiet residential neighborhood, a bit far from centers of activities, but there is a nice garden around the hotel, and a quaint, little private museum next door, which is a nice place to spend a quiet afternoon. It's a bit of a hike from the nearest train station (Shinagawa), but there is a shuttle bus that runs very punctually every 20 minutes or so. You need to ask where the bus stop is to catch it at the station, because it's not obvious.The restaurant in the atrium is okay, but not great--except for the service, which is very good. It seems to try to be like an American restaurant, but doesn't rise up to the level of excellency. I'd prefer if they serve regular Yoshoku (western food) that the Japanese do so well. The breakfast at the restaurant is very expensive, unless you are a Marriott club member. Since I don't like to have a big breakfast, I bought some sweet rolls at the convenient store in the basement, and had them with the coffee in the room, which was excellent. I didn't try the other restaurant on the premise, Nadaman, which is rather expensive.

Suprisingly it is next to my company's Japan HQ. This used to be the La Floret hotel. Location: About 10 mins walk by foot from Shinagawa station (Takanawa exit). There is a shuttle bus provided - go to Bus stop number 6. It is complimentary and runs rather frequently during the week and less in the weekend. It is not a Marriott exclusive bus, so it can get crowded especially during peak hours.Becareful that around Shinagawa itself, there is basically not much to do especially in the weekends when offices are close. Lobby:The lobby is rather hidden, when you enter the hotel, you are greeted first by the Lounge and Dining G (restaurant). There is a concierge at the entrance. I reported to him and he looked up my room and told me to proceed directly to the Exec Lounge to check in. There was someone waiting at the entrance already to greet me.Check-in:Was fast and efficient as expected by Japanese standard. Given all the different vouchers for breakfast at the Lounge and Dining G, Nightcap coupon (because the lounge closes at 10pm), 10% off voucher for dining and internet access.RoomVery well appointed. A modern contemporary style room. If I remember correctly I was upgraded to a Deluxe room, which in Japanese standard was a rather huge room. I had a view out to the Shinagawa station and the port area. Could also see planes landing and taking off in the afar HND airport. (becareful for light sleepers - you can still hear the train running on the 20th floor)Bathroom/Toilet: Very well equipped. However the bathtub was most probably from the old establishment. Other than that, I did not see any other things which looks to be from the old hotel. Water pressure was strong for a nice powerful shower. Executive lounge:Located at the ground floor (same as the lobby). Not the most exciting one as there are no windows/view. Evening offerings are ok. Sufficient to make a meal out of it (though in Japan - why make lounge food your main meal). Overall, a good hotel with good connections to the different parts of Tokyo for tourist or business.

To have adult beverages offered after nearly 24 hours of travel and a lost bag was heaven itself, but the staff were so pleasant they made it even better.

There is a large office building next to the hotel, blocking the view towards Roppongi. On the other side, the view would range mostly south and east, including Haneda airport off in the distance.The location is good but, for most people, at 850 meters distant, probably not walking distance from Shinagawa Station if you have luggage.

It is a reasonable walk to SONY and many other businesses on the Konan side of Shinagawa Station. The gem nearby is the rejuvenated Old Tokaido Road, which wended its way, mostly along the coast, from Edo (now Tokyo) to Kyoto. It’s 500 meters from the hotel’s front door and has many small shops and restaurants, very few foreign tourists and is a very pleasant change from the neon-lit, brash areas nearer Shinagawa station. You could almost think you were in a village.The final touch, when I checked out, was the front desk asking if I would need a cab, and having it pull up at the moment I walked out the door. It seems that this attentive and anticipatory service runs throughout the hotel. It does not come cheaply, but it is very well-done and you feel like your money was well- spent.",Munich,"MunichEricJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Munich</strong>",486,5.0

This is a convenient location in terms of getting to/from both airports and to many of the major tourist areas of Tokyo.The hotel is a 7-10 minute walk (uphill) from station; not so far that it’s a deal-breaker, but just far enough to add a layer of hassle to any commute. Like many big hotels in Tokyo, it’s located within an office building complex. A free city bus goes between the station and the hotel and is well-used by hotel guests and office workers. Frequency is not as much as you’d like, though. I never did find the one that goes from the station to the hotel, but did ride the one from the hotel to the station a few times. Stayed over a weekend so I assume the bus is much more crowded during the work week.As a Marriott gold member I was able to check in at a special area. Food and drink offerings there were beautiful and reasonably varied. I also had free wifi; not sure what the charge is if you're not a gold member.Buffet breakfast in the main area was spectacular, including an egg bar and a wide variety of other choices including freshly pressed juices. Service was impeccable. Restaurant area was very large and could accommodate many guests. Large multistory open space meant that it didn’t every feel cramped or crowded. Service at the hotel is top-notch (it’s Japan, after all). Rooms were clean and up to date; bathroom was large and well-appointed with Thann products and other amenities. This was one of the few hotels I’ve been to in Japan in which the room was “American-sized” instead of small and compact. The room was also very quiet. I felt very pampered in the room.Overall this was a great hotel; the one thing that gives me pause is the location. Over time the walk up/down the hill to the hotel adds up. With so many other choices (including the Prince Sakura (Autograph Collection) much closer to Shinagawa station as well as other hotels in different areas of Tokyo, given the choice, I’d probably lean in that direction.",San Diego,"SanJan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego</strong>",154,4.0

Like other Marriotts in Asia, this property is excellent, particularly for elite Marriott Rewards members. The property only recently came under Marriott's management so it is not listed on sites such as Google maps. The rooms are large by Tokyo standards and have recently been completely renovated. The executive lounge has an excellent selection of wines, beers and liquors (e.g. Johnny Walker Black) and snacks during the evening and they even gave me a coupon good for a free drink every night in the bar after the lounge closed. Although the lounge is not open for breakfast, elite members get complimentary breakfast in the restaurant, which has a wonderful buffet with eggs cooked to order. The location is a little out of the way , about a 10 minute walk to Shinigawa metro station which is a major station for both the Tokyo metro and the bullet train. However there is a free bus between the hotel and the station which runs frequently and takes only a few minutes. Also, I never had a problem getting a cab at the hotel (however since most Tokyo cab drivers do not speak English pick up a card at the hotel desk that has the hotel's name and address in Japanese to show to cabbies for return trips to the hotel). The concierge (a Jamaican gentleman) and staff in the executive lounge were also excellent. The wifi (again free for elite Marriott members ) was excellent--fast and available throughout the hotel. Also I only had to log in once for my weeklong stay which was nice, particularly as compared with many hotels that require log in each time a guest wants to use the wifi.There are a couple of items that can be improved: first, the hotel does not have its own fitness center, but there is a health club located in the same complex which is a quick, indoor walk from the hotel. It has an olympic size pool, tennis courts, etc. However it is VERY expensive( over $20 per visit unless you get there before 9 am, when the fee is about $10. ) The hotel should have its own fitness center with at least basic equipment available for free for hotel guests. Second the hotel does not have a business center. This was not an issue for me since there were a couple of computers ion the lounge but could obviously b a problem for non-elite guests.","Denver, Colorado","Stevesmithgu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",3,5.0

The Executive Lounge didn't seem to be open during the times listed.Pros - the staff. FABULOUS staff and wonderful people. Tips: Get a room away from the rail tracks; it should be a bit quieter, although it didn't bother me. The walk to Shinigawa Station was quick - about 10 minutes and there is a shuttle.

Pillows are very good But the only problem is with the room is the position of the bed which was facing the window and not the TV, so we have to see theTV side ways, I don't understand the logic why the bed is positioned that way since there was ample of space for the bed to realign to face the TV. Working table is too small, perhaps remove the cabinet below the tv and place a bigger working table would be nice. The safe box is way below on a drawer almost to the floor, it will be convenient if the safe box is located waist level height. It will be difficult for someone with backache to bend down all the time to put something in the box.Ample choices of coffee and tea in the room, although house keeping staffs was excellent, they tend to forget to refill them when they come for housekeeping on and off at times. The bathroom is good, with good shower pressure, a bath tub, good selection of toiletries. Wifi is excellent in the room and throughout the hotel. TV channel, was really nothing interesting to watch, 2 news channels, 1 fox channel, 1 sports channel and the rest were all in foreign language, i stayed here for 2 weeks, you could imagine how boring it would have been being in room and having nothing much to watch, perhaps management should look into upgrading the channel packages if there is any.The Breakfast: Have been staying here for 2 weeks, the same menu everyday, the menu can have a better rotation rather then the same thing everyday. I only see salmon or the other fish everyday, suggestion, you could make fried rice, noodle fry, change of vegetable rather then French beans everyday. Overall need to look in the menu and make some changes. The Lounge: Lounge have variations of drinks and food, snacks, and alcohol drinks, varies depend on time on what they serve. The happy hours is from 5pm till late night. Smoking room: The room is below one level from the ground floor. Its kind of far walking from the room and making a turn at the Dining G area and then take an escalator to the base floor. Perhaps could have a smoking area nears to the ground floor. Bell Desk: Bell desk staffs are extremely helpful in providing information, maps, calling taxis, especially Praveeen and Yuri. Hotel Ground: Has a Family mart mini market next building, lower floor. A flower shop A Post office A garden just to relax the morning or evening. The hotel can arrange for airport Limousine bus service to Narita or Haneda, on time and efficient.

We flew into Haneda, so that was closer than Narita which might be a consideration.

So this is more of a personal reflection and a couple extra details. We got here by train, first to shinagawa then by the local train one stop away to kitashinagawa. The walking bridge crosses the street, head right & up a block or so and you're there. No long waits for shuttles if you're willing to take a brief walk. The hotel is much bigger than the local standard bed in a closet room. More to a western standard. We're platinum for now so check-in was in the executive lounge. Excellent English all around. The lounge has plenty of alcohol if that's your thing in the evening. The finger foods were pretty good. The rest are snacks in small glass jars. I do think the lounge is an after-thought. It would be nicer if it was on a high floor with a view instead of a windowless room and a single tv. Service was excellent and attentive, though. The rooms are fine and summed up elsewhere. Breakfast has a bit of the standard western and local Japanese + Vietnamese fare. It was average. They bring omlets to you which delays things a little. And they do guard the coffee a bit much, considering how bitter it is. One nice surprise is the large walkable garden adjacent to the building. There was a local food / beer fair going on which was fun. And if you don't want a fancy dinner there's the family mart at the bottom of the stairs with snacks and some quick noodles. Big picture: Good hotel, reasonable price, excellent service, and an easy train ride from downtown. Improvements can come from the executive lounge, breakfast service, and maybe a chocolate with turndown service :)",Virginia,"Hatzlacha</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia</strong>",203,4.0

Although there is a Ritz-Carlton and Courtyard in Tokyo this is the first “Marriott” in one of the worlds largest and most populated cities. The property was recently rebranded “Marriott” from the previous brand Hotel La’ Forte. Further, as a loyal Marriott member I make it a point to stay with the brand I know best and have expectations to the level of service offered by Marriott properties.The Narita Airport Limo deliveries you to the front door and is the first stop in Tokyo. The trip takes approximately 70 minutes depending on traffic. If you are returning to Narita for your outbound flight it is advisable to purchase the round-trip ticket to realize a small savings in cost. The bus was comfortable and the pick-up was a convenient location just outside the arrivals hall Terminal 1. We were met on arrival by staff and escorted to the Executive Lounge. The hotel is located adjacent to a lovely park and although major rail lines are directly across the street is quite. The hotel evidently went through a major redecoration phase prior to opening as Marriott so everything is new.A number of reviewers complained of the distance from the Marriott front door to check-in, although it seems like a long walk it is only about 75 meters and is close to the elevators. After setting in an airplane for 12+ hours and the bus ride from the airport the walk offers an opportunity to stretch your legs. The Executive Lounge (Marriott Platinum/Gold members or Executive Floor paid guest) is located on the first floor next to the general check-in desk. There was a problem with my Marriott credit card at check-in. It was repeatedly rejected but finally accepted. After getting settled into my room I had a “Fraud” alert email awaiting my review that showed the number of attempts (5) the hotel had made to authorize the purchase, interestingly no two were for the same amount. The card had previously been used in Japan so it was not the location that raised a flag. I expect the issue resulted from the multi attempts and various amounts entered to clear the authorization. Smooth Marriott Executive Lounge operations support customer loyalty to the Marriott brand and are an important aspect of the loyalty program and Marriott Shinagawa was no exception, the staff was excellent and very attentive, although somewhat shy. The availability of an Executive Lounge influenced my decision to stay here, as I’m sure it has/will others. The lounge is a closed room with a somewhat unfriendly environment and is rather uncomfortable, not a place to relax and unwind after a busy day of business or tourism. However, the staff was friendly and helpful in everyway possible. The night manager was on hand to assist with our check-in. After getting into our room I immediately noticed there was no “walk-in shower” available only a high-sided tub/shower. My wife recently had surgery and I have a replacement knee and we both would be challenged and face a potentially dangerous venture each day getting into/out of the tub. I went back to the Executive Lounge and explained my concerns. At first they said there were no rooms with walk-in showers but after checking the system further came up with a solution at an additional nominal daily charge. Mr. Yuta Terakado personally escorted me to the new room to insure it was satisfactory and had our luggage relocated. Exceptional service and attention to the customer! That said, in hindsight I should have verified the availability of a walk-in shower before arrival, my bad! The staff (Mr. Yuta Terakado & Ms. Yuri Ebisuno) were understanding of my need and responded accordingly. After we got settled in our room we went down to the Executive Lounge for a snack and a cold drink. Although the Welcome Information Sheet indicated snacks were available between 7:30 PM and 10:00 PM when we arrived around 8 PM all snacks had been cleared for the night. In hindsight, it was probably a misunderstanding on our part as to the definition of snacks, i.e. finger food on our part and candies and other treats on the hotels side. The set-up appears to be a quick fix solution to address the need for a lounge, hopefully this is a temporary arrangement resulting from the rebranding and a more relaxing environment will be forthcoming in the not too distant future. Mr. Rai Shu kept the lounge food and drink bar well stocked and responded to our every need. Great job Mr. Shu. Ms. Kanako Yorioka was especially helpful in my search for an old Japanese friend from the 1960’s. Another common complaint of other reviewers was lack of available in room storage and overall room size; that was true of the first room we were booked in, but not the second. The bed was comfortable but the furniture is rather uncomfortable. I think we must appreciate Japanese Hotels are not overly spacious, and I have stayed in other Marriott’s whose rooms were even smaller. When booking online the actual size of the room is given so you should have an idea of the size before arriving. The rooms are “Art Décor” in appearance but new. There is a “business” electrical outlet configuration on a worktable (no desk) with Japanese fixtures; you’ll need an adapter to use American three pronged cords; available through the hotel if you forget to bring your own, which I did. Wi-Fi worked fine but the signal was degraded in the bedroom.TV’s with beautiful displays were available in both the setting and sleeping area. The controls however are in Japanese and some programs such as BBC and CNN have Japanese voice over; could not figure out how to turn this feature off or if it could be turned off? There were no channel information sheet/instruction normally available in most hotels to help navigate program offerings/settings. The Executive Lounge does not serve breakfast but offers a complementary breakfast (Marriott Platinum/Gold members) at the Dining G Restaurant. A wide selection of food & fruits, and made to order eggs are available. The restaurant offers a nice relaxing atmospheres and an attentive staff. However, the bill of fare remains pretty much the same day after day (we were here 9 days). The only variety I saw was the substitution of bacon for ham every other day. I also discovered on my third day that a bread and pastry room is located in the rear of the dining area. I had thought this was a private room and had not ventured in before. Management might want to think about letting the customer know about the availability of bread and pastries in this special location! I don’t recall the staff saying anything about where the bread was located, perhaps it is a given we are suppose to know about this? Coffee refills can be a hassle, as you have to catch the attention of a waiter and then will only get half a cup unless you ask otherwise. It was as if they were rationing coffee! Exceptional staff throughout though and many speak very good English. Management should train their personnel not to assume all Asians speak Japanese as the staff launch into Japanese when they see an Asian. My wife for example is Korean and does not speak Japanese but the staff assumed she did and directed all conversation to her in Japanese. There is a “market” in the lower level of the office complex next door from which you can purchase beverages, water and various Japanese items i.e. noodles of various flavor, etc.A free shuttle bus is available to/from Shinagawa Train Station and offers a frequent schedule. This is a real plus. From Shinagawa Station it is an easy metro ride to all points within Tokyo or rail connections for travel outside Tokyo. Regardless of where you stay in Tokyo you will be faced with the need to commute via the metro and Marriott Shinagawa is an ideal base location for your Tokyo stay. Older stations are demanding for those physically challenged as not all offer elevators or escalators for entry/exit to platforms. This should also be considered for those traveling with infants or small children. For those involved in developing travel applications the development of an app that indicates availability and location within a station offering handicap access to station platforms would be genuinely helpful.An exceptional treat is the terrace lounge outside the Dining G. Very pleasant atmosphere surrounded by trees. This was a great place to unwind or just enjoy the outdoors while reading the paper.The bottom line, would I stay here again if I were in Tokyo or recommend it – YES! The costs of rooms are comparable with other properties, a major transportation hub is readily available, and an excellent, attentive staff, and the deciding factor for my decision to stay was the availability of an Executive Lounge. Although the lounge is not on par with other Asian Marriott’s it offers an opportunity get out of the general traffic of the hotel, and this hotel is busy. Previous experiences at Marriott Asian properties (Beijing, Shanghai, Bangkok & Seoul) set the level of expectation and perhaps it would be of benefit to have a “mentor” program with those properties to learn the Marriott way. Mr. Jong Sung Park, executive Lounge was a very good “go-to” person for assistance throughout our stay. One last comment, the housing keeping staff was excellent and the room was kept fresh and tidy each day.","Woodbridge, Virginia","Koyangie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Woodbridge, Virginia</strong>",10,4.0

The bathroom was much smaller than some of the other hotels I have stayed, with only a bath/shower. I have become used to larger bathrooms, even in other hotels in Tokyo. Also, the turn down service failed to come on the second day I was there, leaving me short towels and a fresh bed to go to sleep. While I can obviously make due with calling for additional towels and re-making my bed, it is not up to the service standards I expect from Marriott.The service was a bit lacking. In the lounge, I did not find nearly the level of service I expect from a Marriott - very much a self-service lounge. The quality of the food and drink was adequate, but not spectacular.The breakfast was decent, though my omelette order was completely messed up (ham and cheese came out as mushroom and onion).

Internet service is excellent. Definitely goes for an upscale group of Americans and Japanese. The only weakness is the distance from a subway. They have a free shuttle to Shinagawa station running every 20 minutes, but the freedom to just walk to the subway and then onward lends convenience to the Courtyard Ginza. Staff is quite friendly and everyone speaks English well. The nice thing is that the Narita Express goes through Shinagawa station. The Orange Limousine Bus does stop at the Marriott Tokyo. While wonderful accommodations worthy of 5 stars, the inconvenience of not being within walking distance to a subway stop is a weakness. It costs an additional 730-1000 Yen for cab fare each way.

This is by far the worst. In fact probably the worst Marriott I have ever stayed at worldwide.What can I say that is positive? It is a short taxi ride (700¥) from Shinagawa and there is a shuttle bus (shared with office workers so get in the queue early!).On being dropped off with a large suitcase, laptop and handbag, there were no porters of bellboys to greet me. I made my way into the lobby, and felt as if I was walking in through the back door. To check in it is a good walk through the bar/ lounge area to a body reception area. Apparently though I had come to the right door, it is just laid out very strangely, with no welcoming reception lobby on arrival.Despite being a Marriott Rewards card holder, and having spent over thirty nights in Marriott hotels so far this year, I didn't receive any particular welcome (every single other hotel has offered me refreshments on arrival after a long journey and/or arranged fruit in my room). My room was very small, fortunately it's just me - certainly not adequate for two, and the bathroom is something you might find in a Blackpool B&B (suggest that the manager reads Notes From A Small Island by Bill Bryson if he doesn't know what I am talking about), with a very pokey bathtub/shower. I find it odd that with such a large building with a labyrinth of wide corridors downstairs, the rooms themselves are so mean.Sleep quality? Hahaha! On the 11th floor, overlooking the railway line. In Tokyo the train drivers must exist on five hours sleep as the noise from the trains (if there was a 60second reprieve this was peaceful!) started from 6am and continued until 1am. Earplugs are a must!So arriving fairly late, I got myself settled and browsed the room service menu ringing to order something light at just after 11pm. If you are hungry between 11pm and 6am then that's tough. No room service- I ask you!?! In a Marriott?!!?As in most Tokyo hotels, the gym area is payable, although the price for a very shabby and tired looking gym, shared with the office next door is extortionate ($20), and payable daily.Wifi is complimentary for Marriott Rewards card holders, but is otherwise incredibly expensive.I can safely say that my next visit to Tokyo I will be staying elsewhere. For $200 per night this just doesn't meet my needs. I would suggest that being a fairly new Marriott, the staff are encouraged to visit other hotels within the brand and see what expectations of customers are having stayed elsewhere.

However, I am bemused by the negative comments of others who thought you shouldn't have to pay for the gym, or that the Executive Club is in a strange location, or the hotel location is bad. Yes, you have to pay for the gym, but westerners need to understand that gyms are not a high priority in Japanese hotels. Comfortable rooms, excellent service and good food are priorities, and on all counts, the Marriott delivers. I've stayed at the Sakura Tower nearby many times, and it's very nice, but more expensive than the Marriott.The hotel lobby is a high ceiling, glass atrium, so its light and airy. when I arrived on the limousine bus from Narita, I was greeted by the bell boy, who asked my name. By the time we were inside the hotel, he'd been instructed to lead me to the executive lounge to check in, which was quick and efficient. The Executive lounge is on the first floor near the restaurant, main reception desk and restaurants (i.e. in a good location). It has complimentary hors d'oeuvres, free beer, wine and spirits. The rooms are a good size, with plenty of drawer space, a wardrobe with lots of hangers and the usual slippers and yukata to wear. It has good internet speed, a safe, and a bathroom with all of the overnight toilets you could possibly need. There's A/C which is very quiet.Breakfast was excellent and I was able to enjoy a Japanese breakfast of steamed fish, rice, pickles etc. to start my day. If needed ,there is a good short order bar where you can get eggs, omelettes, etc. There's also a good selection of fruit, juices, breads, pastries. etc. In terms of value, the price I paid last week is about the same that I'll pay to stay in a Courtyard in Boise this week and there is no comparison between the two. Location wise, its about about 600 yards walk from Shinagawa station so its not near the other hotels which made it a bit quieter which is always nice in Tokyo. I can have a brisk walk to the station. Otherwise, there is a free shuttle bus to the station and taxis.Overall I really liked the hotel, especially the service, and I would definitely return.","San Jose, California","dnglobetrotter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",18,5.0

It is close to the (big) Shinagawa railway station(s) which is very convenient when you arrive from one of the two International airports, Narita (by Narita Airport Express) or Haneda (by Keikyu Express). If you don't want to walk, there is a free shuttle bus service every 20 minutes from the first bus stop(#6) to the left of the main exit from the station. The bus looks like a regular city bus and serves not only the hotel but also the adjacent office tower. Hence, if you want to leave the hotel during rush hour you better line up early as you will be competing with the office workers. Our quiet room (2307) was on an executive floor which means access to the windowless lounge on the ground floor. While during the five nights we staid there the lounge never was crowded we noted that repeatedly staff was slow to refill both food and beverages.The room was bright and nice and the furniture""trés chic"" however, the designers have put form over function and we seriously lacked storage space. There were almost no shelves to put our stuff. While we know that the Japanese usually travel lightly with surprisingly small suitcases tourists from overseas whose number the Prime Minister wants to double) spending several weeks in the country need some more space. There was not even a drawer in the single bed stand (for two beds) Having stylish furniture is certainly nice but these designers clearly went overboard and put form over function. On a positive note, our room quickly took on the picturesque appearance of Attila's camp....The bathroom could benefit from some additional hooks. For the shortsighted (who take off their glasses under the shower) making the shampoo and body gel containers of different shape/color would be a real help.

From the moment I entered this hotel I could tell something wasn't right. No bellman to great at the door. By the time he arrived I had my suitcases out of the trunk and ready to go. Then at check in at 4 pm only one of our rooms was ready. REALLY at 4 pm. The restaurant serving western cuisine was inadquate. Limited selection and poor service and we were the only ones in the restaurant. Thinking something wasn't right we asked how long Marriott owned this hotel and were told only since December. ah ha that explains the lack of training. Very poor service here. Marriott send this staff to Nagoya so they can teach them how to be successful. I do not recommend this hotel, although the rooms are very nice, the location, service, and amenities are mediocre at best. There is a fee for the gym which is adequate and has a very nice pool. Overall I am unimpressed with this hotel and cannot give it more than three stars. My colleague is even less impressed.

The exec lounge food in the evenings is extremely poor. Barely could be called appetizers, and exactly the same night after night after night.

The exec lounge is very depressing as previous stated, no windows etc. on 1st floor. Hence no character or atmosphere = shame marriott ! They need to sort this out ! Breakfast in main lobby was superb ! The staff extra attentive and first class selection of dishes (omelette station which will cook your eggs any style and quickly). The hotel is located 10 min walk from shinagawa station (slightly uphill) and no restaurants or nightlife close by. Just a convenience shop (family mart) in b1 selling selection of goods you made need. Did not use any other restaurants in hotel so can't comment on them. I will use the hotel again, but to be honest if you are a tourist you need to be closer to the trains (JR or metro) and restaurants etc. but for business stay it's OK.

It was snowing outside and I suppose it is expensive to heat that kind of hall. I had a quick dinner at the same restaurant and that was quite ok.When checking out the process took about 30 minutes due to incompetence of personnel.

No windows so feels a little claustrophobic. The fitness centre is outside the main building, run by third party and you have to pay USD 10 or 20 depending on time of day. I object to paying at any hotel to use a fitness room especially when it only opens at 7 and the machines are all a little old and mismatched... But service was great, very helpful people. Rooms are a good size by Japanese standards and light and airy. All been recently upgraded/renovated so spotlessly clean and very quiet.

I usually stay at Prince Sakura Tower also near the Shinagawa station (affiliated with Marriott). My last stay my colleagues and I decided to try the new Marriott. Yes the lobby area is very nice and the service was excellent but that is where the highlights stop. The Executive Lounge is POOR in terms of location (first floor) and size. The lounge was very small, poorly furnished and not typical of what I have come to expect in an Executive Lounge. Being that the hotle was new I thought the lounge was in a ""temporary"" location but I was told it was the permanent location. Rooms were small for Platium member and all rooms sit atop train lines coming out of the Shinagawa station so be prepared for train noise in your room! Electrical hookups and outlets poorly laid out. Amenities in bathroom and design also poor for a Marriott name brand full service hotel. Toilets very small and shallow! Worst toilets I ever sat on in all of Japan. Shower? Be prepared to jump in the bathtub and pull the curtain as shower is not a separate entity. I know I sound spoiled and perhaps even a bit snobbish in my expectations as a Platinum member but this comes from staying in Marriotts all over the world that are my measuring stick for Marriott Awards Members. For the first hotel to place the MARRIOTT name on in such a major city such as Tokyo I think Marriott layed an egg big time. Prince Sakura Tower (Marriott Affiliate) down the road is much closer to Shinagawa Station, Has a much better breakfast servise and atmosphere and is overall a much better choice for the Marriott Awards member in terms of expectations from the Marriott brand.","Los Angeles, California","Patrick T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",8,2.0

The staff was very helpful and eager to make our stay comfortable. The bathroom had a blow dryer and a stocked box of toiletries. We had a delievered paper every morning and a electric kettle with coffee and teas to choose from. The bedding was new and very nice. The bed was firm but soft. I slept very well.

There were great views from the rooms of Tokyo but I couldnt open the windows to take a picture without glass. You could see that there were balconies but I guess during the remodel they closed them up. There is a pool and fitness center but its $20 a day to use. I didnt go to the spa.

Marriott is priced right and better value. So this hotel used to be a Japanese business hotel, Marriott bought it and renovated. Majority of hotel workers slide from the old business hotel, but they have good skillsets (like most of Japanese hotel workers are).Building itself is within office complex, like many Japanese modern hotels are. Hotel prepared a welcome gift in my room, which was very nice and never seen in other places like Intercontinental or Hilton...thanks Mr. Marriott!I used the concierge desk to check in / out. Had three guys helping me to check in. Room is good size, has plenty of electrical outlets, fast free wifi, and comfortable bed. Fridge is roomy enough to keep take out left over. I had free breakfast at concierge floor...keep in mind, the concierge floor is on the first floor and not very big, if you are familiar with the one in the US, you might be surprised. Regardless, the waiters working there are awesome and make you a fresh meal in kitchen. There are a few restaurants located within the hotel, very elegant Japanese venue on top floor with ladies in kimono. First floor venue is more casual western style. Both very nice but tad pricy. There's also a very nice fitness center with personal fitness instructors. they also have tennis court, yoga studio, and massage room. It's walking distance to Shinagawa station or take a shuttle bus.

It is about a 10 -15 minute walk from the train station and is located in the same building as offices and what appears to be apartments/condos. The staff is well trained and fluent in English. The rooms are nice but on the small size compared to US hotels and the Prince New Takanawa. What I appreciated the most is the ability to control the air conditioning during the winter months. Other hotels in Japan usually turn off the AC so the rooms get very hot. The club is located on the first floor and elite members can check in/out there. The atrium area near the front of the hotel is very impressive and the bar/restaurant is located there. If walking from the train station, the rear entrance is more convenient but the lobby is difficult to find. This is sure to be a popular hotel due to its location and US branding and will most likely be booked most of the time since only about half of the rooms are currently open.","San Jose, California","zoomy61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",19,4.0
