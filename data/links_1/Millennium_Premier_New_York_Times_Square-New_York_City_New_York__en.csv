Wow.. what a fantastic hotel. From arrival to check out, the staff could not have done enough for us. After a long journey we were welcomed by Monique.. a very warm welcome it was to. We checked in despite being early and went to our room. Monique even called us after a short time to check we were happy with it. The room itself was spacious and spotlessly clean. Floor to ceiling windows meant we had a fabulous view over to Times Square. It’s very secure, you need a room key to get to any of the floors in the lift, brilliant idea. Breakfast was complimentary each morning. Wonderful selection of bagels, cereals, bread, cheese & cold meats and pastries. We could not fault it at all. The coffee in the machine tasted great and was available in abundance along with teas, water and fruit juice. Great start to the day. There was also complimentary drinks in the evening however we just didn’t get back in time to sample these. The location was great, easy to get to tube stations, either end of the street virtually and a lot of the attractions of the city in a walkable distance. We honestly could not have improved on this hotel in the slightest and I would recommend staying here 100%. Special thanks to Monique, you really were the star for us and you are a credit to this hotel. It does have a smaller but very friendly atmosphere here. By far the best hotel I have visited in a long time, in fact i would go as far as to say ever!

Room was fine, although it needed a better cleaning. There were some stains on the carpet and some marks on the walls and ceiling. There was a shampoo bottle under the bed and several packets of coffee on the floor behind the coffee station which is just poor inspection and quality control.

It’s my go-to hotel in NYC. Usually I like it very much, but this trip made me question my judgement. Bottom line, the check in staff was surly and unhelpful. We arrived at 3pm and were informed that checkin time was 4pm and that we would have to wait. No rooms were purportedly available. Then at 3:45pm a different person came and we checked in no problem, except that we were given a room on the 4th floor. I have never had a room this low in this hotel. If I had, I never would have returned. There is constant street noise at this level, primarily the beeps of backing up trucks— at all hours of the day and night. DON’T EVER ACCEPT A ROOM BELOW THE 8th Floor in this hotel or you will not get much rest. The complimentary breakfast is excellent and afternoon snacks and wine are good. The rooms are nicely designed though lacking basic amenities like electric outlets on both sides of the bed. The paint needs a touch up, the carpet some patching, and the down-lights proper installation (so they don’t dangle out of the fixture).The crowning blow on this stay was the absence of a bellman to return checked luggage upon our eventual departure. It took 20 minutes for someone to come return luggage to the 10 people who had queued up at the luggage room door. Managers came, radioed, and called, but no one solved the problem for an very long time.Net, the aspirations of this hotel are largely unfulfilled at this time.","Chicago, Illinois","MarvP_13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",4,3.0

The Premier appears to offer a slightly more intimate experience, with seated check-in. I had booked this hotel as the rate offered through an online travel agency was good value compared to similar 4-star hotels in the vicinity. First impressions were positive - nice cool quiet lobby, seated check in and friendly staff. Despite my 11.30 am arrival, I was quickly checked in, but not before being informed that I was liable for a further USD 34 ""facility fee"" which included cocktail hour, continental breakfast and Wi-Fi. This practice is a new and unfortunate way for hotels to charge customers extra while avoiding adding to the room rate. My fault for not having read the fine print, however, in this day and age when ALL hotels offer free WiFi, to say that it's covered by the facility fee is simply disingenuous. Further, in a city like New York with its plentiful dining options, charging guests for breakfast is simply a way of forcing customers to pay for a service which otherwise would not be required.I arrived at my room (721) to be greeted by a strong body odour which is common to Indian people. Air-conditioning was noisy and rattling, but I chose to ignore this as the hotel is clearly quite old, as evidenced by the retro fitting of the bathroom and the bedroom furniture and fittings. To be fair, the room (an entry-level ""Premier Queen"") was very spacious, with a 2 seater sofa beside the floor-to-ceiling windows and a queen-sized bed. Wifi was free and fast. I rang the Operator to ask a few questions and was addressed as ""buddy"", which I felt to be overly casual and inappropriate. On another occasion, one of the female recepionists was chewing gum openly when on duty - again, I wonder about the training and professional standards. The hotel's location very near Times Square is probably a bonus for most tourists, but I tried to avoid the sensory overload and crowds as much as possible. The continental breakfast ""included"" in the above-mentioned facility fee was acceptable in terms of variety and quality, if one could find a seat. The facility comprised several sofas groupted around low coffee tables, and several high-top tables and chairs. The seating capacity was clearly inadequate, judging by the queue of guests waiting for seats. For the price paid, I cannot complaint about the value, but I would not return to this property until a refurbishment has taken place.","Melbourne,Australia","Bryan L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne,Australia</strong>",111,3.0

First time in NYC. I love that there are about 6 rooms per floor. The bed was comfortable and we had lots of pillows, which I like. Our room was a nice size. The complimentary continental breakfast and happy hour were very generous and classy. The breakfast and happy hour wait staff were friendly and kept food and drink coming. We got a room on the 16th floor with a city view. It was amazing. I hope to get a similar room again. Now, there are two issues that came up which could have been prevented with better management. But thankfully, they have an incredibly caring concierge, Monique, who would not stop until all was well. Issue #1: On the first two nights, there was no central air ventilation. No heat, no A/C, no fan. No nothing. It simply was not working. It was the last week of April/first week of May, so NYC was still quite cold at night. We had no heat. One of the night staff sent extra blankets, which we accepted. But I made it clear that this is not a replacement for working heat. The night person said that the hotel had recently reset the central air for the entire hotel for summer and that is why there was no heat. But if it was set for summer, then we should have gotten at least a working fan. Nothing was working with our thermostat and air control. Dead on arrival. This was a Sunday night and the night concierge told us that they had to wait until Monday to get it fixed. Uh, excuse me, but this is a 24/7 hotel with guests staying here. It doesn't matter what day of the week it is: if it's cold, the heater needs to be fixed. Other guests had also complained of no heat. Monday morning, we met Monique, the daytime concierge. We told her about the problem. She said she'd take care of it. Maintenance people DID work on the hotel's central air that day, but there was still no heat on Monday evening. We had a second night of sleeping in a bone-chilling cold room. Not comfortable.By Tuesday night, the heat was fixed. But now, there was no A/C for the warm weather. (It had gotten hot for one day.) Only heat was available. Shouldn't guests be able to adjust the thermostat to whatever temperature is needed? But finally, we had fairly adequate central air. Things were much better.We appreciated Monique staying on this and doing her best to get through the line of command to get maintenance to fix the system. I think a new central air system should be considered, or maybe just get the existing one properly fixed and adjusted so that guests can get the fan, heat, or A/C, depending on the need.Issue #2: We reserved the ""New York City Break"" package which included a daily $25 meal credit at the hotel restaurant, which we took advantage of on several days. When we first arrived, we were told by the night concierge to simply let the wait person at the restaurant know we have the NYC Break package and the restaurant will take the $25 off our bill. Well, the waiter said the restaurant doesn't take that off the bill. He said we need to charge the meal to our room and then when we check out, the hotel's system will know we have that NYC Break package and the $25 per day would be automatically taken off at checkout for each day there is a restaurant charge. We told the night concierge what the restaurant had told us. She apologized and said she didn't know they were doing it that way. However, at checkout, the meal credits had not been applied to our bill. Luckily, Monique was checking us out that day. She also saw that we didn't get our credits. She tried to get a code to enter into the system so that it would take give us the meal credits. It wasn't working. We had rush out to go to the airport, so we paid the bill as-is and Monique said she would get that $ refunded by the time we got to the airport. She called me in Newark airport and texted me the new copy of the bill with the reversed charges for the meal credit. We really appreciate Monique's ability to fix these issues, and she did it with such friendliness. Man, she is quick! A problem solver. These issues could have been prevented with management making sure everybody is on the same page. If you offer a meal credit on your room packages, make sure you have a process in place that everybody knows about which ensures the meal credit is actually given to the guests without us having to chase things down. And it is not too much to ask for a properly functioning air system. We paid what we consider a premium for the stay, so having a freezing room for two nights is unacceptable. I can understand one freezing night, because stuff can break down anywhere, any time. But two freezing nights is a red flag. Monique genuinely cared about this and escalated it.This hotel has all the elements to be considered excellent, but running of the daily business of serving the guests could use some tweaks and some processes in place to make sure things run more smoothly. I walked through the lobby a couple of times and heard a front desk person apologizing to a guest and discussing an issue. I think if some internal things can be fine-tuned, the complaints will be reduced. By the way, all the staff we encountered were very nice and friendly.The hotel is in a great location and it's on a fairly quiet street, a block from Times Square. Really convenient. We walked to the Richard Rodgers and Shubert theatres to see shows, walked to the Ed Sullivan Theatre to see a Stephen Colbert taping, walked to 30 Rock for various things, etc. The hotel is nice looking, upscale, quiet, and overall, we had a great time. I will book again here on my next trip. And I hope the central air will be okay. Thank you to the friendly staff, and especially Monique for all her help.","Oakland, California","MMinCA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland, California</strong>",5,4.0

The breakfast and evening reception were well appointed and served by very friendly, lovely staff. The room was dissappointing. It was dated and not at all what it was advertised to be. The walls hadn't been painted in years, the wallpaper was peeling, the carpets were stained and dirty and the air-conditioner was a wide open vent in the ceiling that blew directly onto the bed all night so we were either too hot with it off or freezing cold all night. If that wasn't enough it wasn't clean - specifically the shower was filthy and glass from a wine glass that shattered by the window wasn't cleaned up properly. It stayed that way for all 3 nights of our stay. I was drawn to this hotel because of the convenience/ proximity to times square, its 4* rating and the luxury of having both a shower and a bathtub but after seeing how dirty the shower was I wouldn't even think of bathing in the tub. And thank goodness I didn't as we both contracted some type of foot fungus from the floors/shower. I'm mortified!! The bedroom closet was so close to the door that it wouldn't fully open, making it difficult to use the closet at all. We unpacked on arrival and put our clothes in the drawers, because the closet was inaccessible, but were then unable to wear them because after being in the drawers they smelled like sour milk or something rotten. I'm incredibly disappointed! This was a once in a lifetime trip for my husband and I for his 40th birthday and our first time away from our 4 children for 4 days. This was by no means an inexpensive hotel. We paid well above average, even for this area, for what was supposed to be a beautiful, modern, and luxurious hotel.

Because I have been having trouble with my knee, I wanted a hotel close to the theaters I would be attending. In past years, I had stayed at The Millennium Hotel several times and found it to be excellent in every way. Now it appears to have been divided, with the original hotel run by Hilton and the more recent “Premier” next door run by a British company. For some reason, last week all the hotels I checked on had doubled their rates, which added financial “injury” to insult. When I arrived to check in, the woman at the desk in the otherwise empty and darkened lobby (at 3:30 in the afternoon) barely looked at me as she handed me the key card. The room I had reserved was indeed large and neat. There was no bedspread, throw, blanket on the bed — just the white top sheet. The spacious desk had a pen in its plastic wrapper, but no note paper, directory of hotel information, TV listings, information about restaurants, the neighborhood, etc. — just the pen. There were lots of empty cabinets— some with their insides clearly removed (perhaps with a mini-bar or fridge at one time?). There were 2 glasses and one small bottle of hotel-branded water, and a non-branded single-cup coffee maker that I had to call housekeeping to get to function. There was no turn-down service (as one might expect in a “premier” hotel for almost $400 per night. And no room service at all. There was, on the mezzanine level, a small lounge that had cheese and crackers and wine from 5:30-6:30pm and yogurt, coffee and pastries for a few hours in the morning.

My flight was cancelled from Houston I called to tell the hotel at that instant that i would be a day late. The next day I called to get an early check in and 1.5 hours later as my flight from Austin was wheels up i was told they cancelled because i failed to show. I called them twice the night of. Unfortunately I had to call 10 times and most likely more because they cant figure out the phone system. Then Lisa called to express her concern and they she wished they could make it right but i wasnt staying at the hotel so nothing she could do but if we stayed again they wanted to make it right. Well theres f the staff weren't incompetent we would be at the hotel and no one would be upset. I called her back and it took 4 calls before anyone took a note and Charles cut me off midsentence to transfer me. I think they recruit from the finest truck driving centers.

Several times there were not enough seats and we found ourselves looking for someone to leave so we could have their seats. Not very good. However if you can put up with that it’s a pleasant hotel.

The morning of our departure we found a bill for $142.10 for resort fees which my husband immediately went and discussed with Monique. She crumbled the paper up and through it away and said she forgot to make the adjustment and would take care of it. Upon my departure she assured me also that she would credit our Amex. A few weeks later, my Amex bill arrived.....no credit. I called immediately and Monique told me it was still sitting on her desk and she would credit. Five days later still no credit.

It was a great location and a small, quiet hotel that didn't have a crowded bar or lobby to get through which was nice for kids. When we arrived, the hotel didn't have our reservation (through Expedia) however which was very annoying. Thankfully the front desk wasn't busy and they let us use their phone to call Expedia, who in turn had to call the hotel themselves and resolve the issue. Apparently this is a common problem with Expedia where a reservation doesn't make its way over to the hotel that you book. Luckily the hotel had a room for us, despite the fact that it was Dec 21 (close to Christmas) and we were staying for 3 nights. We had also booked a 'ball drop view' room through Expedia and the person at the front desk at the hotel said that Expedia has no ability to guarantee a room like that and they shouldn't advertise as such. It could have been quite the mess for us but within 20 mins everything was resolved, only because the hotel had the room available for us. I can't imagine what would have happened had they not. Continental breakfast and happy hour (one drink plus finger foods) are included which was a nice touch (but you pay $35 US per pay hospitality fee). The room was a good size and modern...but the bathroom is a little rough around the edges; loose faucet, moldy shower...but overall great for a family traveling with kids. (comparing to ROW NYC the rooms were much bigger at Millennium).","Richmond Hill, Canada","Kaniz S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond Hill, Canada</strong>",10,4.0

It has an internal connection to Millenium Broadway new york wing of the hotel, we can use all the facilities like the gym etc at the broadway wing. It's just beside Hudson theater, in fact the theatre is right in between the Premier and Broadway wings. There was complimentary buffet breakfast available, nothing special very basic like shelled boiled eggs, toast, cereal, fruits, guava and orange juice, milk and some pastries. Surprisingly the hotel provided complimentary bottled water, so thumbs up for that!We paid extra for the ball drop view. We were put up on the 16th floor and wanted an even higher like 20/21. I checked with the concierge 3-4 times if higher rooms were available but they always telling me I should check later as nothing is available now. I thought maybe they could just note down my request and let me know if any higher floor room was available rather than me checking with them again and again. The location was fantastic... Exit from 44th street and walk to broadway in a few minutes. Exit from 45th and there is a starbucks right next to it. Times square is super close!The room was quite average I thought, it was small (as is the case with most NY hotels I believe) the bed was ok. The TV was placed in a very odd position like perpendicular to the bed and not facing it. Also the closet was just beside the door so whenever we had to open the closet it would bang against the door not making it a very good experience. So overall, the hotel is average with average bf (but attentive staff), average hotel room (but clmplementary botted water), average view from the 16th floor (ball drop view). I would maybe try a Hyatt or Marriot next time.","Singapore, Singapore","librandips</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",34,3.0

Despite reading reviews to the contrary, we checked in before 4pm and the receptionist was very friendly and check in was efficient. We were on the 7th floor and the room was a good size and fairly modern. Bed was large and comfy-lots of space. Can’t fault the room at all really. We had paid for breakfast as part of our stay and this is why we have given an average score instead of very good. Breakfast is on a mezzanine floor that is in no way built to hold the number of guests in the hotel. There are not enough seats or tables (people were standing up or went back to their rooms) and the selection of food was limited. It didn’t seem like a breakfast room. It was more like a run down waiting area. As a result, we only had breakfast there twice and chose to go to diners in Times Square for the rest of the holiday. The hotel is a good place to use, as a base, as the location is on a side street, just off Times Square. All in all, I’m not sure we would stay here again. The room and location were good but the breakfast deal was not worth it and there aren’t any other facilities in the hotel so you are just getting a room.

Bathroom with a good sized bath and usable shower. Room clean and comfortable with housekeeping attending on a daily basis. Couple of slight niggles including only one bathrobe and slippers when two occupants and a little bit of noise from nearby air conditioning units but other than that no real issues. The room did look perhaps a little dated but more than adequate especially as we were on holiday and used it as no more than a base.Although the hotel states the board is room only they do offer a complimentary breakfast taken in the mezzanine. This consists of cereals,fruits,pastries etc as well as tea,coffee and juices. There is certainly enough to have a reasonable breakfast before setting out.Also a nice touch is the free wine and cheese/nibbles available from 1730-1930 hrs......very pleasant and relaxing after a days sight seeing. Also a nice way to set up for an evening out. Comments have been made regarding the size of the room,which can accommodate about 25 people,as being small and cramped. Whilst there were occasions where there was a bit of queuing in general seating was available . However the seats are lounge style,which although works for the evening wine and cheese are not the most comfortable for the breakfast This hotel is sister to the millennium broadway and is joined by a corridor between them both and should not be confused with that hotel .... the broadway is larger but also offers a quite reasonable Thai restaurant.

Walking time to other main attractions,including Central Park,Rockefeller centre,Empire State building etc is about twenty minutes.

They provided a bathrobe and slippers too, which I appreciatedThere only 10 or 12 rooms per floor and lobby, floor, and breakfast area felt very boutique like, private, and cozy (and quiet). Nicely decorated rooms with Keurig coffee maker too. Great view of the city and peek at Times Square (our room could see the infamous ball)We missed getting to enjoy the complimentary happy hour, but did catch the comp breakfast each morning which was ok. Nice fresh fruit and pastries... but a huge espresso machine that could make lattes too (and other coffee drinks with push of button. I asked for an alternative milk, and was joyfully poured a cup of almond milk. (I could have gotten more if I asked). They are promptly done serving breakfast at 10 though... so don't be late.Many theatres are located close to this hotel so makes it a prime spot if you plan to do this during your stay (i.e.: close walking).In an adjacent building is a fabulous 'roof top' bar overlooking the city. We're told the highest (public) bar. ""Bar 54"" You need to get a 'card' from the restaurant on the main floor, then take the elevator to floor 54. You must show this (card of permission) to be seated. Kinda like a hush-hush speakeasy, that's made easy for out of towners not normally in the know.

There are better midtown options but by the time I booked, they were much more expensive.Pros - — Quiet compared to Sofitel, Muse - no street noise on the 19th floor; small hotel so little noise from other guests or elevators— Room size is decent for price, with bed, desk, couch. Lots of windows and they open for “fresh” air— Quiet ventilation system (should be normal at all hotels but it’s not)— Decent and fast room service with enough semi-healthy options— Location - near Broadway, 6th Ave., 15 minute walk to Central Park— Coffee maker in room should you need that first thing— some sort of breakfast included, although I did not try it.Cons - — cleanliness questionable - when trying to find a place to plug in my iPhone near the bed, I encountered vomit in the corner by the window, which a previous guest had cleaned a bit but obviously housekeeping missed. Reported and it and they apologized, but it wasn’t that hard to see...have never been fastidious about hotel cleanliness (who could stay in a hotel if you were) but almost left the premises.— Maintenance questionable. Shower barely drained, leaving a little pool. Reported it but not fixed. Toilet often needed multiple flushes.— I didn’t need taxis while there but not clear how easy it would be to get one - no line of them near by.— No place by bed to plug in devices, and alarm clock has the VERY old dock for iPods - the 1 inch wide one that nobody has any longer.

The official check in time is..... at 16! and check out is at 11! That was a shocker.So, 5 hours to clean?! Well, we were checked in at 19 while the person on duty was still getting the keys ready for some other guests, answering the phone that was rinning off the hook, and repeating to us to wait since she had to finish sth, she had started prior to attending us. Before 16 p.m., there is nobody at the ""reception"", which is just 2 desks. It is like a haunted house. The only person in the hall is the porter who announces in no uncertain terms to all who walk in, that the check in is at 16, so people should leave the luggage and off to see NY before that. The hotel feels very understaffed, disorganized and unwelcoming. Even to use a bathroom while you wait, you have to cross to Millennium Broadway and ask the concierge for a key. The common bathrooms are for clients use only, and only at the sister hotel, but I have seen much cleaner public toilets than that one.To soften the check in experience, the hotel offers what is grandly called a wine reception to get the clients drunk and happy and not so grumpy about the wait. It is a nice plus, but I rather have human smiling reception ready to help and answer questions, and check in, starting at 14 and even a bit earlier if the room is ready. Complimentary continental breakfast is a nice touch. Coffee is surprisingly very good, freshly ground. But the mezzanine is not created for breakfast. It is a bar lounge with a few low chairs and low tables. Eating breakfast crouching over your plate while other guests wait for you to finish and get off so they can sit, was ""fun"".A computer+printer in the mezzanineto check in and print your boarding passes us nice, too.The room we were given was just next to the elevators (319), it meant a sleepless night both from the noises outside and the elevator motors. I tend to think they might have refurbished rooms that do look like the ones on the official photos on upper floors, but ours was a shabby run down with moldy bathroom/shower.The room itself is spacious, has a complimentary bottle of water and a coffee machine. A/C sounds like a 737 about to take off.Thanks God it was just 1 night, I doubt I would consider this establishment ever again.I guess the only big plus of this place is the location.",,Elena L,0,2.0

We stayed for a week here. The rooms were a good size with one double bed and a sofa and tv in the main area. The bathroom was a great size and had a bath and a separate shower. There was a desk and a wardrobe with a safe and a coffee machine. The only thing not in the room was a hairdryer which was a pain but according other family members that came later in the week they did have a hairdryer so we must have been unlucky. It is in a great location just around the corner from Times Square and situated by loads of great restaurants which are feet away. The day we checked out my niece was taken ill and the staff were amazing giving her the room we had stayed in back to rest in while we waited for a taxi to the airport. We really appreciated this as she needed to rest. Not every hotel would be this accommodating so huge thanks to the concierge for sorting this. Breakfast at the hotel is a bit makeshift with there only being a small area to eat in, with chairs and coffee tables, there is no proper tables to sit at. The breakfast is continental in style and you help yourself - finding somewhere to sit can be hard at busy times so be aware of this.

This was our fist visit to the US and we wanted to be ‘in the thick of it’ so chose the Millennium Premier as it’s just off Times Square. Not for the faint hearted or those looking for quiet retirement! While the double glazing mutes the sounds you can still hear the traffic and sirens crossing Times Square and the shouts from the bar from the opposite side of the street and it doesn’t really quiet down until 2 or 3am. The city that barely sleeps.We asked if possible for a room with a view and manager Niek obliged on the 17th floor directly overlooking the Times Square ball drop. Absolutely fab! We were also welcomed with a personal card a bottle of sparkling water, a bowl of fruit and macaroons. Thanks guys, you made us feel special.The hotel itself is cool, clean, quiet and spacious. The staff are all very welcoming and helpful. You feel secure as you need a room card to activate the elevator. Our room was large with a sitting area at the foot of the bed with a big flat screen TV. What the Americans call a double bed we in the UK call a King size. It was massive and very comfortable. The floor to ceiling windows afford you plenty of light and a great view out over the roofs opposite.The bathroom is supplied with toiletries – gosh your toilets are low in the states! The decor was a bit tired, our sink was cracked and it could have done with a lick of paint but it wasn’t terrible. We had a separate bath & shower. The tub was excellent nice and deep and very hot water. The shower in my opinion was a total let down. Absolutely needed refurbishing. The shower head didn’t spray correctly it was like being under a garden hose and the drain smelled like perm lotion! (I used the bath)They supply an iron and ironing board, safe, hairdryer, Ice bucket, coffee machine, comp bottles of water each day. I requested a kettle in reception as I wanted to make a cup of tea, sadly they don’t stock kettles!!!! I was told use the coffee machine to get hot water  Guys, you can’t make a decent cuppa with tepid water. Poor do on that front.Complimentary continental breakfast was perfectly adequate. The only grumblers are those who expect overflowing plates of cooked bacon. You have an unlimited choice of cereals, pastries, toast, hard boiled eggs, yogurt and fresh fruit. There’s a coffee machine which hallelujah produced hot water for my beloved tea LOL. I suggest getting down to breakfast early, that way you find a seat AND you’re hitting the sights before the crowds build. If you get back in the early evening you can partake of the complimentary wine and nibbles. We only managed this one night, but it was good wine.One thing to bare in mind is NY hotels charge a daily city tax. Unlike European hotels this can be quite steep and is added to your final bill. We booked direct with the hotel so all taxes and charges were payed in advance.

However, there have been several issues with Millenium staff, resulting in my giving a final overall rating of 1. We booked the hotel through a tennis tour company, so we could go to the US Open. Upon trying to check in, I was told our reservation couldn't be found. There was some confusion about which hotel we were booked into, for some reason there's The Premiere Times Square (our booking) and Millenium, which is attached to the Premiere with a lobby. (The Millenium looks a lot nicer ,by the way). Luckily when I asked at the Millenium side, they found our reservation #, but said we were at The Premier. Walked back to The Premier, gave the reservation #, and they found it. But informed me that the reservation was made in the name of the person with whom we booked the tour. I was told this would be fixed. It never was. I even had to use the name of our tour provider to log into the WiFi at the hotel. Next, I received an alert that a charge of several hundred dollars was put onto our credit card (this was after the $50 standard charge that's put on the card and then dropped later). I asked at the desk, and was told it was an error, since we had already prepaid through the tour company. After 5 nights, we went to check out. We had paid for valet parking ($70 a day!), since we're not familiar with the city and had enough trouble finding the place to begin with; we didn't want to figure out which parking garage would allow us to park the car for 5 nights. We didn't drive it at all after it was valet parked. Anyway, the gentleman at the desk explained that because there was a festival blocking the street, they couldn't pick up our car for us. I pointed out that we shouldn't have to pay the $70 dollars for the last night since they couldn't pick up the car. He agreed to lower the price for the 5th night, then placed a call to his supervisor to ask if he could comp us the last night. He was told yes, then only charged us for 4 nights ($280.00). We were given the parking voucher, which he signed, and then dragged our bags 2 1/2 blocks to the garage. We retrieved our car and drove home. Upon arriving home, I checked our credit card, and the erroneous charge had not been removed. In addition, they added another charge! I called the hotel, and was told that our account was in arrears for the unpaid parking night, plus the room had cost more than we paid through the tour! I told them they needed to work out the room cost with the tour company, and I explained what had happened with the comped 5th night. I then e-mailed my contact at the tour company, who said she'd look into it and get back to me. I checked my card balance again, the first 2 erroneous charges had been removed, but now there's a new one! Since several days have gone by and still no resolution, I called my credit card to dispute the most recent charge. NOW, on to a review of the room and our stay. The room was fine, although the view wasn't much. If I looked hard to the left, I could see a sliver of the lights of Times Square. I will say the room was quiet, there are only 7 rooms on the 18th floor, not sure how many were occupied. There was an ice bucket in the room. My husband went down to the desk to ask where the ice machine was, and was told there wasn't one. He was told that someone would bring ice up; they never did. The free breakfast helped on costs, and generally had a decent selection: muffins, bagels, cereal, fruit, and at first, yogurt. After 2 mornings, the yogurt was gone and was replaced with cottage cheese. Disappointing. The men that stood in the room watched everything like a hawk, and swooped in to pick up your plates immediately. It was odd. While our room was not advertised as having a mini frig, there was a large cabinet that the coffee maker sat on, and there was nothing in the cabinet at all. I suspect at some time in the past there was a mini fridge. I would not recommend staying at this hotel; it's been a big hassle.","Hampstead, Maryland","photoJenic51</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hampstead, Maryland</strong>",14,1.0

We will not be making another trip. The entire visit was inconvenient. We arrived around 2:30, understandably before the 4:00 check-in, they stowed our bags but assured us they would call if our room became available, otherwise it was ""guaranteed"" by 4:00. We came back around 3:45 with no luck, we sat on the floor of the lobby with the dozens of others waiting for their rooms. When 4:00 rolled around, we were told they were unable to make keys, so each time a guest checked in, the desk needed to call security at the floor to let the guest into their respective room. After being told our room was ""guarenteed"" by 4:00, our room was not ready and so we were down graded, thankfully for a slightly lower rate. We got to our ""partial view"" room by 4:30 and left again by 5:30. We returned around 9:00, still no keys. This time when we got to our room, after a lengthy wait at the elevators, we realized there was no refrigerator and no coffee pot, the latter seemed particularly odd, especially for a rather pricey NYC hotel (which had a very outdated feel in general). When we received our bill in the morning, it did not reflect the new, lower price due to the downgraded room. The front desk resolved the issue and the money was credited back to our account. The saving grace was the professionalism and kindness of the staff. The front desk dealt with the leas-than-ideal key situation well, and when we did arrive to our floor, a well-mannered, well-dressed man was waiting to let us into our room.Despite recalling a great experience in the past, this stay, unfortunately, fell short of memorable for the right reasons.",,Heather S,3,3.0

I had previously been to New York with my family of 5 and stayed in the east village so this time when going with my partner I wanted to stay closer to midtown. Bare in mind that we are both in our early 20's and I am a student so I wasn't looking for anything too expensive but wanted a good location and a comfortable place to stay. I had reserved rooms in other hotels further away from times square and when I came across the deal in this hotel I was shocked to see that this hotel was coming in a lot cheaper and a lot more central then the hotels I had previously looked at. I quickly booked this hotel and cancelled all the other reservations as this was ideal for us. It was cheap and cheerful, very central and had lots of bonuses such as free Wi-Fi and a free continental breakfast.Upon check in staff were all very friendly. Check in was quick. Had a problem logging into the Wi-Fi and the staff fixed it straight away. They also sorted us with a taxi to go back to the airport and stored our luggage for us that day after check out. Staff were all so helpful! Room was huge and had lots of room for suitcases etc. Rooms were well equipped with smart TV , corner sofa, desk, coffee maker, bath & shower and hairdryer. We requested a kettle and it was brought up straight away. Room was spotless and cleaned everyday with clean towels and new toiletries. If we hadn't gone by the time house keeping came around they would ring and ask what time we wanted the room cleaned. We also had a fantastic view of the ball drop from times square right outside our window. Beds were super comfy and the shower/bath always had hot water.Breakfast was ideal considering it was free. Yoghurt, fruit, cereal, bagels, toast, pastries, juices, teas and coffees, Saves you having to pay for one somewhere else and fills a gap in the stomach. Yes the breakfast room is small but you can bring the food back to your room if you wish. Hotel was as close as you can get to times square and very close to the times square subway station and port authority.

I was pleasantly surprised to discover that The Premier Times Square was not one of these!!The hotel is ideally located on 44th street between 6th and 7th Avenues which makes for a short walk to Times Square and several subway stations.It is important to note that the Premier Times Square is adjacent to the Millennium Broadway which has a much larger lobby. It is easy to get confused. The Premier Times Square has its own lobby which is much more intimate. (You can access the Premier lobby from the Millennium Broadway lobby by walking in front of the Hudson Theatre which is sandwiched between the two hotels.)First impressions are important to me and so the (uncharacteristic for New York) extremely warm and friendly greeting from the woman manning the check-in desk set a very nice tone for our visit.The room was a nice size and featured a large flat screen TV and work desk. The king sized bed was very comfortable. The bathroom had a separate tub and shower. We stayed on the 14th floor and could barely hear even the loudest traffic noise.A real bonus is the Happy Hour where wine, soft drinks and a few snacks are served.The breakfast buffet is somewhat limited with toast, pastries, cereals, hard-boiled eggs, fresh-brewed coffee and various juices. That said, it is better than paying $30.00 per person to get the same food at a local restaurant!!The only nit that I had was that there is limited seating in the breakfast area which means that you may to eat standing up during busy times.All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and this will be our ""go to"" hotel when we visit New York.","Alamo, California","SES_Traveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alamo, California</strong>",44,5.0

It was very close to the subway which we used a lot to get around and being right in the middle of Times Square, also very close to numerous stores. I was worried about the size of the room because everyone complains about small rooms in NY but I was not disappointed by it on arrival. The room was a good size for two people. It was very cold, we cranked up the heat in hopes that it would help, it didn't. I slept on the side of the bed closest to the window (about 6 feet or so from the window) and froze the first night. I asked for a second blanket on the second night and it wasn't too bad. I think the problem is that there is a door that leads outside (not accessible to guests) that is part of the huge window. Thew view wasn't terrible but there is not much to see from our room, we stayed on the second floor in room 225. You can also hear all the city noise but I am able to sleep through loud noise.

The hotel is well located, clean and the room was a good size. The staff were friendly and helpful. I will definitely go back.Found the hotel slightly difficult to locate upon arriving. The front of it’s sister hotel, the Millennium, is very obvious as is the front of the Hudson Theatre next door. On the other side of the Hudson theatre, there is a glass rotating door which takes you into the lobby of the Premier (this can also be accessed by entering the Millennium, turning right immediately, going past the suitcases and through the doors into the Hudson Theatre Lobby and out the other side).The Premier feels much more like a modern boutique hotel as soon as you enter the lobby. Check in was quick and efficient (the queue I’d passed in the Millennium was very long by comparison) and you never have to wait long for a lift.The room was spacious, clean and kept warm for arrival which was appreciated when it was around -10 degrees C outside! There is a safe, umbrella and coffee machine (with tea capsules as well as coffee) in the room. The only thing that I felt was missing was a fridge. The room was very quiet in terms of noise (as was the hotel in general), impressive given it’s next door to a theatre and its proximity to Times Square, which meant that I got a great sleep each night.The bathroom is the biggest bathroom I’ve had in a New York hotel and it was great to have both a shower and separate bath. The only slight downside was that the bathroom was colder than the main room and the heating didn’t seem to reach the bathroom as much.Many of the amenities and services are in the sister hotel the Millenium, but thankfully you do not have to go outside to use these as you can go through the lobby of the Hudson. Found the staff at both hotels to be very helpful when I needed to go between and find anything. Breakfast is complementary and served on the second floor of the Premier. A huge plus point for me was the joint mail centre in the Millenium, which meant that I could get a parcel shipped to the hotel. Other four star hotels I’ve stayed in in this area have charged ridiculous fees for even one package so I really appreciated being able to go and collect it with little hassle (a message was left on the phone in my room telling me it had arrived).There is obviously plenty to do in the surrounding area, including a grocery store (Whole Foods on Bryant Park) a number of coffee shops, pharmacies, shops and more. There are two subway entrances within three blocks and it’s also only a few blocks away from Bryant Park where you can get buses to the various airports around the City.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","diablodancer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",68,5.0

We visited Central Park, Rockefeller Plaza, Top of the Rock, and MoMA, my son really isn't capable of a full day of walking 6-10 miles. Times Square makes a good central location to transfer to different lines and we took advantage to ride down to Liberty Island/Statue of Liberty. Every staff member we encountered was fantastic and considerate. We were allowed to check in early. On our final night, my son was so exhausted, he had a small accident in the bed. The staff was fantastic about it and we left without any problem. Our room was equal in quality and size to a much more prestigious chain, it had a king bed, large bathroom and L-Shaped couch.

The receptionist was efficient, very professional and warm. The reception area is small and bright and modern, infact the whole feel is simple and clean. Our room wouldn't be ready for another hour or so, so we were told that we could avail ourselves of complimentary drinks in mezzanine level bar and that if we needed a space to change clothes or prepare for our business meeting that day, one would be made available for us. AMAZINGLY helpful. Our room was ready and we were shown up - LARGE - wonderfully spacious, bright and modern. Clean as a button. A very comfortable bed. Plenty of hanging space, tea and coffee making facilities, but no-mini bar. Sofa, occasional chair ... very spacious. Better yet - QUIET. As we were no longer in the main drag it was lovely and quiet - bliss, not need for ear plugs. We slept like babies.The bathroom was modern and well designed, again very spacious.A good sized bath, a separate shower, excellent water pressure. A shower curtain which puzzles me as it seemed a little twee and out of place. Brilliant hairdryer, well lit vanity and did I mention space ? Lovely soft white towels,bathrobe and slippers.Sadly we only spent one night here, but hand on heart if I ever make it back to NYC for another conference I am booking in here. We had to leave early to catch our flight home, but our friends stayed on until that afternoon and we were informed that that really enjoyed a lovely breakfast.","Doha, Qatar","482mhairim</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Doha, Qatar</strong>",96,5.0

Small Breakfast of pastries, coffee, fruits and cereal was provided every morning in the mezzanine. One issue however, is that there is no left turn for cars to enter the street from the main road, which made it difficult for our Uber/Lyft drivers to pick us up as they could not enter and have to go around. There is also no refrigerator in the room. The lift to the mezzanine for breakfast never worked .. you either have to go to the ground floor and ask reception for another lift card or walk the stairs to the mezzanine.

We had a King room with amazing city views & good enough glimpses to Time Square. The walk is 30 seconds to Time Square!!!!! The rooms are not far from needing an upgrade but they are still good enough to get away with it. Our bed was very comfortable but my pillow was way too hard!! No fridge made it a pain to store incidentals. We found we could easily hear the people next door through the adjoining door, so hope my cough didn't keep them awake all night :( The man who checked us in failed to tell us about the mezzanine dining room with complimentary breakfast and aperitif 2 hours every evening!!!! Nor did he give us an access key!!!! We stumbled on it the 2nd day while using the computer/printer on the same floor. We would have been very PISSED OFF if we had found out we'd missed this!!!! It is very generous of the hotel to offer this extra, great selection of food for breakfast & happy hour including wine and soft drinks. Also we found the service from every waiter on the mezzanine exceptional!!! They were attentive, ready to serve and friendly!!! Thank you, an awesome way to finish a big sightseeing day in New York!!!! We went to the Irish Pub, O Donahues & Virgils over the road and found them both great!! We also went to a great little Italian place, Bella Vita Pizzeria & Trattoria just off time Square on 43rd St after seeing Aladdin & it was very authentic casual Italiano. Don't tell Mama, piano bar is definitely worth going too as well.

Our intention had been to get somewhat close to Times Square and be somewhat pampered, instead we were centrally located and generally disappointed. The Premier is a lamprey add-on to another hotel (The Millennium), skinny and tall (only 7'ish rooms a floor). They offer a location that's only half a block away from the center of Times Square and above a certain floor you do have a view of the big apple...though most of the view is of the street and accompanying buildings. The room was relatively small (250 sq ft) with a king bed and a bathroom which had a tub.However, the hotel is just worn down or not kept up well. The wiring of the room is odd, with all lights but the bathroom (and most of the power in the outlets) controlled by a single switch. The room we stayed in had severe signs of misuse and abuse that hadn't been addressed: cigar hole in the carpet, tub drain didn't work (rendering the tub useless), mildew on the counter, crayon on the walls, stripped appliance locations, every single light fixture was crooked or jutting out from the wall, and obviously unprofessionally repaired sink fixtures, non-existent bathroom vent fans, etc. Even the towels, robes, and toiletry items provided were sad/worn or frayed.Services were provided by a nearby hotel and not this hotel itself, and such simple things such as appliances were add-ons (want a fridge...$40, want ice? call housekeeping).

We were booked into a neighbouring hotel and promptly checked out into this absolute find! I had a room on the 6th floor with a good enough view of the Times Square Ball. Cannot for the life of me remember the room number but if you come out of the lift, you head towards your right ... last room on the right.Comments:1. Modern though compact rooms. I honestly didn't mind the size. I like modern. I am not happy in a tired room even if it is large - makes me sad and I want to go back home.2. Great mattress. It took us at least 3 days to adjust to a new time-zone but I can attest to the fact that after I had said goodbye to the jet-lag, I had the best sleep ever.3. Ample size full bathroom - although shower was surprisingly small, even for me at 1.5 meters tall and slight in built - so be prepared for a bit of a squeeze but water always hot. 4. No street noise whatsoever.5. Housekeeping was extremely responsive and appeared in minutes with my requested extra duvet and kettle.6. Reception also really friendly and extremely helpful.7. The lifts are super-fast. This is not something to be under-rated. In the previous hotel we stayed in, we had to wait at least 15 minutes for the lift to arrive. At this hotel, I don't think I waited more than 60 seconds.8. The location .... what more can you want ....you can see Times Square from your room, less than a block away (ask for a room with a good view in advance). Close to all the attractions.9. Ample cupboard space ..... with plenty hanging space.10. THE BEST PART OF THIS HOTEL? The Business Lounge and their staff. Make sure you request that you have access to this super, fantastic benefit. You have access to a computer, printer (for free). You can also chose to have your breakfast here (for free) comprising mostly pastries, muesli, yoghurt, boiled eggs etc. Then 5:30pm to 7:30pm they have a free bar with wines and snacks which on a few nights included salmon. All for free. You also have access to the lounge for tea/coffee and quiet place to work. Beautifully decorated and nice lighting at night. Aircon can be a bit strong. However, make sure that when you book, you do have access to the lounge.Don't confuse this hotel with the Millennium which is right next door which is a much bigger, older hotel. This is the Premier Millennium on Times Square. Smaller and fewer rooms on each floor.","Johannesburg, South Africa","Devi_HQ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Johannesburg, South Africa</strong>",7,5.0

When I asked if I'd missed the evening reception, I was informed I would not have access to the Premier lounge complimentary drinks and continental breakfast due to the ""rate"" at which I reserved my room. The front desk attendant informed me that unless I book directly through the hotel, I wouldn't have been given access. When I asked for more detail (this came as a surprise and embarrassment on my part as I didn't mean to act entitled), he let me know the policy had been changed some 3 months (!) ago and reiterated that booking through the hotel itself was the only way to gain this. When I inquired about adding it to my reservation, he told me simply ""it wouldn't be worth it as there are plenty of less expensive great breakfast spots around"" and when I asked for suggestions, offered the 24-hr ""Cranberry"" around the corner. I've done some looking around on the website this morning and can't find this information disclosed anywhere. Please, Premier, if there is a disclaimer as to who has access to the lounge, please put it in a transparent place so that others may know of your policy in advance. I do find it interesting that at the top is says to Book Direct for Free Wifi, so some things are disclosed but some aren't.I am traveling for business and I looked forward to the efficiency of a continental-style breakfast in my hotel in the morning and drinks to unwind in the evening. I cannot imagine a family who expected to cost-effectively feed their family before a day of sightseeing in the city learning of this at check in and having to then budget for breakfast every morning!  As someone who read reviews before booking this hotel, I thought it important to warn other guests who may be expecting this service only to learn of this policy upon check in, after it's too late to cancel their reservation.","Birmingham, Alabama","tcane1900</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Birmingham, Alabama</strong>",6,2.0

The room service menu was limited, but the food we ordered was good and arrived in a timely manner. There's also a 24-hour deli across the street. We would totally stay here again. One comment for improvement is having a small fridge or ice access on the floor. You can get ice, but you have to call housekeeping and request it.

Good start. The room was nice, little small, but clean and nice, no problem with the room, yet. I decided to rest for a bit and watch TV before hitting NYC, only to find that the TV did not work, it wouldn't turn on. It took almost an hour and about 4 phone calls to get someone up there to fix. The wait was not the problem, the lies were. Every time I called they promised someone was on the way and yet no one ever came. I finally went down to the little lobby desk to inquire and was treated so rudely as if I was the problem, as if I was bothering them by trying to get someone to come make the TV work in a room I paid for. The gentleman who checked me in defended by saying that he did me a favor by not charging me an "" early check in fee"", as if I was supposed to stop complaining about a broken TV because he did me a solid ( all he did is give a guy with a reservation a room that was ready, not a miracle worker). Upon checkout I asked for bill/receipt and they gave me someone elses charges and credit card. Bill said charged to Master Card, I don't own a Mastercard, and rather than be polite and try to get to the bottom of it they rudely insisted it was right, because none of them really knew what the answer was so they tried to make a case that they were right and that I really did have some unknown Mastercard.

The safe was the easiest one to use I've ever come across in a hotel and the hairdryer the most powerful - only small things I know but they make for a better stay along with a walk in wardrobe and pleasant toiletries. The breakfast was more than adequate with a good selection of cereals, fruit, yoghurts, toast, bagels, pastries, etc and unlimited tea, coffee and fruit juices. Last but certainly not least is the staff. Reception, porters, maids - all were extremely pleasant, cheerful and helpful even when dealing with difficult customers. We mostly dealt with Monique who calmed us down on the first day when we were a little fraught and sorted our problems out while joking with us, making us relax, and putting our minds at rest with the lovely room she allocated us. Nothing was too much trouble for her and she sorted another problem out for us a little later while remaining unfailingly happy and courteous. Yes, it's her job but not everyone conducts themselves like Monique - a big thank you to all the staff but especially her.

It was difficult to find the hotel and after we had driven past the hotel before my husband drove around the block (approximately 30 minutes due to Times Square traffic) I exited the car and searched for the hotel. I asked Veronica to check me into my room. She said it was policy since I had used Priceline to book the rooms that only my husband could check us into the room. At that point I told her I need to use the bathroom and she told me that I needed to go elsewhere. At that point she had both my credit card and my drivers license. I am covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act and in Illinois we have the Bathroom Access Act. I do not know what human rights act would cover this incident in NYC because I have not researched that issue, nonetheless I would hope that human decency and respect should be a part of the hotel's policy toward guests. Two nights prior Hotel Edison gracefully handled access to my guest room. While I waited the half hour for my husband to circle the block I was able to overhear her complain about a customer who was having difficulty with their room air conditioner and the conversation with the valets and another gentlemen about how awful the NYC subway system is compared to the 1970s and 1980s. The next morning when we were leaving Monique was amazing and professional. It is what I expect when staying at an establishment of your caliber. It is my hope that it is not hotel policy to treat your clientele so rudely and with the utmost disregard for the disabled and merely a retraining of staff to be courteous, helpful and respectful to all guests with or without disabilities.","Naperville, Illinois","happytravels423</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naperville, Illinois</strong>",6,2.0

The breakfast is a selection of pastries, bagels, bread etc. served alongside yoghurt, sliced fruit, jams & butter etc. You can toast your bagels etc. There is also a self serve bean to cup coffee machine for fresh, lovely coffees & this provides a light, filling breakfast. On an evening, the same room serves some basic 'nibbles' & a selection of hot/cold drinks. Wine is served FOC however unlike when some friends recently stayed there was no bottled beer, not a spoiler though as this quiet hour provides a nice interlude between day time & night time activities & the hustle & bustle of the city. It's somewhere lovely to just rest your feet for an hour before setting off for an evening 'on the tiles'!The room is well equipped with a supremely comfortable bed, large cable TV with a good selection of channels including movies, an iron with ironing board, hair dryer & pod style coffee machine.

I didn't expect much as someone had warned me to stay away from Times Square hotels because of the congestion. Boy am I glad I didn't listen! I booked four nights here because of the location, and the room rate included wifi, daily breakfast in the hotel and an evening happy hour. Also, I tend to prefer smaller hotels.First, it wasn't easy to find the hotel as we arrived by taxi around midnight and there was no obvious entrance. Also, the front door was locked. We had to ask around, and we were told to backtrack two doors to the Millennium Broadway Hotel, which is part of the same chain. Hauling our luggage (yaay for wheels!), we had to enter through the Broadways' lobby, make a quick turn right into a passageway through a theater lobby to get to the Premier's lobby. The Premier's lobby itself is small and intimate, which is nice in that we never had to deal with throngs of tourists or wait in line. We were immediately checked in and directed to our room (on the 16th floor, I believe, as we had paid for an upgrade).The room was surprisingly spacious! We requested a king bed, and there was also a sofa plus ample room for our two medium size suitcases and carry-ons. The bathroom was also a surprise in that it included a bathtub with an unusual counter configuration and a small corner shower. After walking around NYC, I thoroughly enjoyed soaking in the bathtub every night. A white waffle weave robe was also provided, along with lightweight bathroom slippers. Those were nice touches.The Keurig coffee and the complimentary bottled water were very appreciated. Housekeeping was also very accommodating in providing more upon request.And the complimentary breakfast on the 2nd floor lounge was great! We didn't need or want big breakfasts, but we were thrilled by what they had available: fresh fruit chunks, yogurt cups, granola and hard boiled eggs. There was a variety of mini danish pastries and a make-your-own waffle machine. There was a huge toasting tunnel machine for bagels and an assortment of breads. Juices and coffee and water bottles. In the evening, the same lounge served as a happy hour bar. It was wonderful relaxing there with wine, cheese and crackers and brief conversations with other guests. We shared suggestions about the sites we had visited and where everyone had come from. We met a British mother & daughter who met up in NYC because the daughter now lives in Colorado. We met a young Hispanic couple who were enjoying a break in his military service.The food and drinks in the lounge were nice, but the staff was even better! All of them were so helpful and accommodating and generous with the small water bottles. Those come in very handy for taking vitamins or day trekking and were very appreciated! Don't forget to tip them well!The location of the hotel was great, within a short walk to Times Square and near Broadway theaters. We are seniors but were able to walk to the Empire State Building and back from the U.S.S. Enterprise with occasional break stops. It's also not too far from the bus line and subway although I wouldn't want to haul luggage there. There were 45 steps down/up at the nearest subway stop!I think this is a great hotel for independent travelers. No crowds! The most people we encountered were in their intimate 2nd floor lounge, but even then we always found a place to sit and enjoy our breakfast or happy hour. The room rate is not cheap (we paid an average of $400 a night for an upgraded room), but you receive good value and they don't nickel and dime you for everything.I would not recommend this hotel for business travelers who need support services. We had a Fedex envelope sent to the hotel and told the front desk that we were expecting it, not once but about 3 times. When it didn't arrive at the front desk (which is really a desk, not a counter), they told us to check with Shipping. We left a message on Shipping's voice mail and told them what we were looking for. We didn't get called back until a day later, then we were told to go to the Millennium Broadway Hotel to retrieve the Fedex envelope. My husband had to find that hotel's Shipping Department, where he encountered a guard who was not very helpful. We got the envelope a day late and just before checkout. It was a good thing that the contents weren't too vital or time-sensitive. I felt that was the weakest part of the hotel.Finally, the concierge/doorman was very nice about trying to help us hail a cab after we checked out. Unfortunately there is very little traffic on that street (which is a positive too), and any taxis that come by will have already picked up a fare at Times Square. We waited a long time out in the cold with no success. We finally had to haul our bags up to 6th Avenue where we quickly snagged a cab. I don't know if the Premier Hotel has any car services they can call, but it was never suggested and should have been if this is a recurring problem.All in all, we considered our stay at the Premier Hotel a great stay and a great value.","Southern Province, Sri Lanka","redtsunami</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Southern Province, Sri Lanka</strong>",22,5.0

It is literally in the heart of Times Square and if that's where you want to be, this is a great choice. I don't need to say much about the location, it speaks for itself.The hotel itself is modern, rooms are large by NYC standards and it is very well appointed. The bathroom is large, the room is spacious and surprisingly quiet given its location (remember we are in the middle of Times Square), so there is some noise.The room had a coffee maker, iron and board, a great selection of TV channels on a large TV. The bed was comfortable with nice linen and generally very clean,The gym is open 24 hours and it is quite well equipped.If you don't want to pay for 5 stars, this is an excellent choice.

I did my booking through priceline, where it was showing me a 5 star property in times square with breakfast included and with gym.On arriving at the hotel i found out the lobby was infact smaller than what a three star would have, and on top of, it the receptionist who checked in us was really very very rude, as per me she does not deserve to be in a customer service job at all. Though i appreciate one thing about the hotel i got the room at 11am versus the checkin time of 3pm.After checking i realised they do not have anything of there own, the gym is located in the hotel next door if you want to access you have to go there. Also they provide you only with a name sake breakfast which has only the bread butter, flakes, tea and coffee. But you have an option to upgrade your breakfast by paying USD 10 per person in which case you will have to go to the hotel next door to have the breakfast. The rooms were very small and was given queen size single bed room and that too on 3rd floor. Since the booking was done using a website which hides the name and reveals only when booked, the rate you recieve should be the lowest available but unfortunately after i booked i saw the same hotel giving high floor rooms at a lower price on different website that too disclosing the name before hand. This makes me feel cheated for sure.I would never ever intend to visit this hotel again as its not at all value for money, only except the location which is the best.

Forgive the novel, but I felt you deserved a full picture.My girlfriend and I had been talking about going to NYC for Christmas, but we never had the budget in place. This year, we saw that Premier had a good deal and booked it in November. Coming away from it, I'm not sure I'd want stay with them again based on the staff's lack of professionalism, foresight, and overall knowledge. --------------First night: Employee talking about me while I was right there1. Since we're on a budget, we planned to make our 9 hour drive. The trip turned into an 11 hour drive because the hotel does NOT have a visible sign. ""Millenium Broadway"" is visible, but it’s a different hotel. It does not say ""Premier"" anywhere except a small logo on a glass window that you won't find if you're driving by. So, we passed the entrance twice and it takes forever to loop around in traffic, right? I parked the car a block up to go search for the place manually and managed to find it and check in. After being in the car forever, I wanted the Valet to park the car. He offered me different parking places that are cheaper that I'd have to go find. Being unfamiliar with the city and tired, I just wanted him to take the car and park it. When I stated that, he said, ""well, but it will take about an hour for us to get it for you when you need it."" He said there was a parking place across the street. I said, fine, I'd take it myself since it was within view. I waited 20m in line for them to tell me they were full. So, I parked the car let the valet know I'd really like him to take it. He offered other places. I said, ""let me be clear that I have been in the car for 11 hours and I'm tired. I don't really want to be in the car anymore."" He got the picture and I showed him to the car. His body language was very annoyed and then he said, ""oh, it's ALL the way up there?"" It was literally right up the street. It took less than 10 seconds to walk there. Maybe actual 10 seconds. On the way to the elevator, I couldn't believe my ears when I heard him tell a co-worker in a frustrated voice, ""she wants me to get her car and It's all the way down the block."" He even said it in front of another guest! I was so surprised at his lack of professionalism. It said a lot about the atmosphere there that he felt comfortable saying that to his co-worker in front of myself and another guest checking in.Day 2-4: Double charge that they could NOT get fixed2. The next morning, my girlfriend and I had planned to do some shopping, so I checked my bank account and found a 586 dollar charge on my account for the stay...but we already payed that in November! I thought, okay, no big deal, I'll just let them know this happened. I went downstairs and found Monique at the front desk and let her know the situation. She called someone, firmly let them know of the situation, called another person to let them know check-ins need to be more attentive as it displayed we paid and let the manager know, saying it'd prob be dropped by the afternoon with a smile on her face. She was ON IT and knowledgable! But, by mid-afternoon, it was still there. I was out and called in to check on progress, asked for the manager, explained what the call was about, and was put on hold. Then, a guy picked up who wasn't the manager and asked me what I was calling about with an annoyed tone. While trying to explain the situation, he kept interrupting me to tell me my charges incidence fees. I kept trying to tell him that I was talking about the additional stay charge. He kept re-interrupting me to correct me on what I was talking about, and I had to raise my voice to tell him he wasn't listening to me, and he said, ""you can be pissed but that's not going to fix the problem."" What did he think I was trying to do? He said he'd transfer me to the manager, and then told me the manager was busy. I let a ""of course he's busy"" slip, and he said, ""oh of course he is, because there's 729 rooms and only one manager,"" and then put me on hold. I was not transferred to the manager, but a lady named Victoria. She was very professional and though she hadn't known anything about the situation despite Monique requesting this on the phone the day before, she said she'd put in a request to have the charge dropped because accounting had already left for the day (it was like, 2pm). I let her know we had already done that, and she assured me that it would be dropped within 24 hours. 24 hour later, it was still there. Exasperated and now my girlfriend paying for everything, I decided to go to the manager in person on the Millenium Broadway side. When I went to the front desk, the lady told me he was in a meeting and it should only take 15 minutes. A half hour later, I asked if he was out. She said he wasn't and I asked if she could let him know I was waiting. She said she didn't know where they had the meeting and had no way of contacting him. I found this really surprising and frustrating -- everywhere I have ever worked, if I have needed to contact the boss about something, there has always been a way to do that. I sat down again and waited, and after an hour, I had to leave. While on the other side of town, the manager called me to visit. When I got back, he told me he'd fix it by calling my bank and giving them a code. My bank said they didn't do that process anymore and he was confused and told me he didn't know how to work the system, but he'd try to fix it himself, then said he wanted to give us free breakfast in apology. I told him I'd rather accounting did it and that we already got free breakfast and asked if it could be a dinner. He agreed to a $50 room service dinner and gave me a card with a previous manager’s name crossed out and his own scrawled underneath it. Then, the room service guy wasn’t informed and tried to get us to pay for it. AND we were charged tax and gratuity for it! I couldn't believe it. The next morning, our last morning, I got up early and visited Monique. She checked our account, deleted the gratuity pay and extra charges we shouldn’t have had, and when we checked out and someone asked us for another random 80 dollar charge, she told the lady “no, not for this room.” She then made it clear she’d follow up with the manager that everything was dropped. And by the next day, it was.We still had a good time, but it really took a lot away from the experience because I spent so much time worrying about money and being frustrated.The good things were: breakfast was good, the hotel looked clean, and the room was gorgeous.","Columbus, Ohio","Kristen G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",5,2.0

Firstly the lady on the front desk at check on was more interested in talking to a colleague than telling us the information. She told us she had written down breakfast and happy hour times but only gave us our room cards, nothing else. Secondly, reception closes at about 10pm and if you need assistance with anything you have to ring the neighbouring hotel down the same block and they will assist you. I don't really like the idea of this, I prefer reception to be open. We needed to check breakfast time when we arrived back to the hotel at 10pm but couldn't as there was no one there to ask!The bed was comfortable, the bathroom wasn't the best. There was NO heating in the bathroom whatsoever, the heating in the room was blow heating (noisy) but this didn't extend to the bathroom. Not good in December! There was only 1 bathrobe and slippers in a roon for 2 people. Also only 1 shower cap per bathroom. It's a room for 2!!!There were no plugs beside the beds and only very limited plug sockets in the room itself.I was disappointed with the tea making facility, no liquid milk option, only powdered creamer. Little things matter. There was an awful drilling sound before 7am each morning, I'm not sure what it was, possibly the plumbing as I don't believe there was any building work on the hotel or surrounding area.I was really happy with the computer and printer facility as this averted a near tragedy for us when we hadn't printed out the correct theatre tickets. Thank you! Breakfast was ok, the breakfast room was not. Comfy chairs and low tables, the chairs were shabby and torn (not all of them) and some people were standing eating cereal as there wasn't enough seating to accommodate.

I had just stayed two days at EVEN Hotel which I really enjoyed so I think that effected my experience here. Here are the positives: great location (if you have to stay near Times Square); smallish hotel so it's pretty quiet, the lobby staff are great, there is breakfast and a happy hour (see cons below). Nice amenities (ironing board/iron, safe, shoe polish type stuff, hair dryer) in room. Internet connection was very good. Bed was comfy. Great black out curtains. Complimentary bottle of water provided.Cons: the decor of the rooms is kind of tired (I'd date it 1995) and more importantly is very last century in that there are inadequate outlets or other means of charging devices (make sure you don't just bring USB charger as there were no USB outlets). The closet was so small and jam-packed with stuff (see ""amenities"" above) that it was difficult to keep your small carry on sized suitcase in the closet on the luggage rack and still be able to open it and access it and then forget about trying to hang stuff because they'll be hanging down to your suitcase. The bathroom was huge and included a bath tub which means that the shower was a tortuously small space, the width of the door. The lights are all on or all off (except for one desk light) so you couldn't really set your own mood. The TV takes up so much space on the desk with the space-aged lazy susan it was on that you literally have about 2.5 feet between the TV and the wall to work. Lastly, the sleep quality. It boggles my mind that we pay so much for hotel rooms in large cities that can't be used for SLEEPING IN because of noise and other factors: it's near Times Square. Ear plugs and the fan going aren't enough to drown it out the noise. The door had about a 1.5 inch space at the bottom that required you use the bath towels to blot out the light from the elevator lobby. Surprisingly, when I did that, I noticed light still emanated from AROUND the door. Then of course there's the slamming of the doors because all the other guests don't understand that the automatic door mechanism will SLAM THE DOOR SHUT if you don't hold the door and let it close gently. So, the room is actually a very expensive place to store your stuff (but not easily access it) near Times Square where you can get some work done because of the good internet connection and take a nap or two.Then if you want to use the subway, you're walking about three blocks ACROSS Times Square (a feat in and of itself during the holidays)...Lastly, the happy hour and the breakfast. They are fine for what they are..haven't read the reviews here and I'm sure people feel the breakfast didn't have enough variety or whatever. My complaint is that the space they make everyone cram into was inadequate and with seating for maybe 20 people, you'll probably be standing with your breakfast. It was an average experience overall...","San Diego, California","calpoidog</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",152,3.0

It is close to countless restaurants and theaters.There is a fairly small lobby, which is not atypical in New York, but I was quickly greeted by the helpful hotel staff. I actually arrived slightly early, but they found me room anyway that was very welcome after an early morning trip.The room itself wasn't large by midwestern standards, but was just fine and, again, typical for New York. The decor was modern with a little bit of a twist. I liked having a room with some personality. There were plenty of plugs for electronics, a large flat panel TV, and Wi-fi was included in the price, all good. My view was out the front, which turned out to be really cool as I had a view of part of Times Square including the ""ball"" that falls on New Year's eve.They have complimentary light cocktails between 5 and 7 that I did not try, but would be nice after a long day. They also have a free breakfast that I did - It wasn't especially fancy, but they did have some very fresh fruit, including pineapple, and a variety of breads and cereals. The staff was extremely friendly.This hotel is an excellent choice in mid-town Manhattan, and especially good if you are going to one of the many nearby theaters.","Chesterland, Ohio","Gregory M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chesterland, Ohio</strong>",771,5.0

The location is right off of Times Square, so you're close enough to the action, but still removed a bit from it. It can be hard to find the entrance. I ended up having to check the address before walking in. The lobby is very small and cozy. Check-in was quick, if not overly friendly. (She did warm up as I said hello to her every time I entered or exited the lobby.)My room was a standard Premier Room. There are only seven rooms on each floor, making it feel very boutique. My room had a bed, desk/chair, wall-mounted flatscreen TV, and a loveseat. The furnishings were vaguely Scandinavian. I also had a small fridge. The bed, pillows and linen were comfortable. The bathroom must have been from a previous design scheme, very different than the blonde woods of the bedroom. There was a separate tub and shower, a long counter with sink, and toilet. It was very clean, if a tiny bit dated. The water pressure was adequate and the towels were on the fluffy side.Wifi in the room was very fast. And the AC worked very well. I was very fortunate that I had a view of the New Year's Eve ball in Times Square as well. (I cannot imagine how expensive that room has to be on NYE.) Apparently, there is a lounge with breakfast and afternoon service. I was unfortunately working and couldn't make it for either. Overall, I really was happy with my stay and would definitely consider returning to this hotel. The location is great if you need to be in the midtown area and I particularly liked that it felt like an oasis in the midst of Times Square.","Austin, Texas","lakeflyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",164,4.0

Back to the happy hour, given the price of drinks in the local area you can make a big saving here, so seriously consider, my partner bought a glass of wine next door and it cost $17.50, makes you think doesn't it ?

I didn't get a name but a male told me $36 which was incorrect. of course it is based on your meter and the traffic. it cost us $60.00 and took an hour and a half from LaGuardia airport at 11:00 am weekday. going back it only cost $26.00. due to less traffic. he also told me the big bus tour was the same price if you buy it from them. it actually is cheaper online the day before. we had breakfast also next door and it was good and had a good price. other than getting misinformation it was a nice stay. also the day we got there the person at the desk was not very friendly although she did get us a room early with no additional cost. it was next to the elevator and the view was terrible but at least the elevator noise was not bad.,dayton ohio,"Janet C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>dayton ohio</strong>",0,4.0

We recently stayed for 4 nights at The Premier Hotel (our first time at the hotel). We were very happy with our choice. Check-in was smooth, and our room was ready by 3 p.m. The room was very pleasant, modern, and large by NYC standards. The bathroom was especially spacious with lots of counter space and both a tub and a tile/stone shower stall. We were on an upper floor and away from any noise. The “tap” room key card makes entry easy; the key is also used on the elevator for extra security. Breakfast in the lounge provided just enough selection (and the coffee machine was fantastic; a double espresso decaf in seconds; heaven!). The lounge seating was comfortable and allowed for private conversation. For those who like a more substantial breakfast, a sign outside the lounge (and in the lobby) let people know they could go to the restaurant next door and get a discount as a guest of the hotel (we were happy with the continental breakfast in the hotel so didn’t try the restaurant). The wine and cheese in the evening was also a relaxing event. Two minor quibbles: the music in the lounge (at breakfast and in the evening) seemed a little intense – something a bit more relaxing would have been nice; and the seating in the lounge was limited. We always got a seat (we went early), but some people had to wait or couldn’t be accommodated. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel is in a great location just a few blocks from Times Square and so there’s easy access to theatres and restaurants (but it’s far enough away so that you can avoid the noise and the crowds). There seem to be a good selection of restaurants and pubs very close to the hotel. For us, the nearby pub was great for a drink and a snack after seeing a show. We both agreed that, without question, we would happily stay at The Premier Hotel on a future visit to NYC!","Waterloo, Canada","LoriMichaelC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waterloo, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

Only about 6 rooms on each floor, and we didn't hear any noise. Lovely hotel and all staff were always pleasant and willing to help with anything. We had a queen room, bed great and so comfy, room even had a sofa. Bathroom had separate shower and bath, and also had bathrobes and slippers, along with complimentary toiletries. Breakfast was more than sufficient with bread which could be toasted, bagels, croissants, cereals, hard boiled eggs, pastries and drinks, great start to the day. Free wifi, which was great for my daughter. Also between 5-7pm there was drinks (beers, wine, soft drinks) and snacks which were free, a lovely touch, and a bit of chill out time. Another small touch was there being an umbrella left in the room to use, as was raining the day we arrived. Even to get a taxi the concierge would go outside to flag one down for us.Times Square literally at the end of the street and about a 10-15 mins walk to Empire State Building or 5th Avenue. Great Irish bar across the road from the hotel, food and atmosphere was lovely. Also a great meal (American portions) and the best cheesecake ever at Juniors Restaurant, from hotel, go to bottom of street straight over Times Square and its just on the right, near the theatre showing Matilda....well worth a visit. We couldn't eat our cheesecake so they boxed it up to take away with us. Myself and my daughter loved this hotel and would definately go back again and would recommend to others. ",,Donna A,10,5.0

Besides the size of the hotel room, the hotel itself is basic. CONS: Hotel Room: No minibar, not even a fridge. Shouldn't this be in a ""luxury"" hotel? Only 1 bottle of water provided.Threadbare/cheap small towels: My husband took a shower after we checked in and showed me the towel which looked like the equivalent of something you'd find in a 1-star hotel...it actually started ripping as he dried his back...I had to laugh!! It was also barely bigger than the size of the hand towels. Shower curtain: this should not be in a ""luxury"" hotel...gross. No plugs by the bed: as mentioned by othersFaucets: in both shower and sink are ridiculously old and basic and badly in need of updating Breakfast: way too many people, hardly anywhere to sit. There were a few items like toast but nothing to actually put on the toast. Do yourself a favor if you stay here and just go to the Red Flame diner a block away for breakfast (we did every morning after experiencing that debacle in the hotel)...cheap, tasty, and great customer service! Happy Hour: again hardly anywhere to sit...but the concept is niceCheck-in: Walked in to an empty lobby with no one around except a woman sitting at a desk. She couldn't be bothered to stand up from her desk. There was no greeting or eye contact when we came in. I had to say ""hi checking in"" and all I got was ""what's the last name?"" and then was asked for ID. After all was done, I had to ask where breakfast was. Her response was ""Mezzanine."" I'm not a mind-reader so I had to ask where exactly ""Mezzanine"" was because she didn't provide that information and of course there was no sign indicating where breakfast was in the elevator or the room so glad I asked. Check-out: At check-out, same woman who checked us in just says ""you're all set"" after handing her the keys. Nothing else. No ""have a great day."" No ""thanks for staying with us""...nothing. Staff: Other staff members we encountered during our stay (such as the bartenders at happy hour), were very pleasant. These issues I would pretty much expect from a 3-star hotel. I would expect WAY more in the way of customer service at check-in and check-out.PROS:Hotel Room: by NYC standards, the room is quite large with floor to ceiling windows...nice! The room is also located on very quiet floors. Keurig coffeemaker.Bathroom: the size is large. But again as mentioned, the faucets and the shower need to be updated as well as better towelsLocation: fantastic, right in Times Square, close to subway lines and Bryant ParkGiven the pros, I still wouldn't stay here again.

The front desk is unstaffed at night. (See photo of empty reception desk.) Ringing the bell got no one. A sign said to go to the front desk at the hotel next door. Why in the world would one stay at this hotel if it is necessary to use the front desk of the adjoining hotel?Next, there is the bellman who did not want to get my wife a cab. Although this hotel is near Times Square the traffic flow in 44th is not ideal. It is hard to get a cab there, and the surly bellman caused my wife to miss a much-anticipated restaurant reservation. Third, there is the room. We had a safe placed so high in the closet that my wife could not reach to use it. There was a cabinet with a fallen shelf and a door almost off its hinges. Finally, there was the shower. The shower (see photo) was a small square that appeared to have been an afterthought. With a curtain, instead of a door and too-small a lip it presented the delightful experience of both having the curtain repeatedly clung to one's body while simultaneously flooding the bathroom.

The hotel has 21 floors, we were on the 19th and although we could still hear the sirens and city noise it was only faint and did not disturb our sleep at all. There were only 6 rooms on our floor and we had a corner room. You can access the hotel either at its front entrance on West 44th Street or from the rear of the sister hotel (Millenium) on West 45th Street which is a great short cut if you are coming in from that direction. We stayed at the hotel for 4 nights and booked 12 months in advance and got a great deal which included continental breakfast and a ""happy hour"" between 5pm & 7pm. Breakfast is pretty basic but we found it sufficient. A choice of cereals, bagels (on some days) bread which can be toasted, muffins, pastries, fruit, boiled eggs. Choice of spreads such as jams, honey, cream cheese. Fruit juices, coffee and tea. The room where the breakfast is served (Mezzanine) accommodates about 30 people on comfortable chairs with low tables. The happy hour is also served from the Mezzanine and is a choice of white or red wine, soft drinks, coffee or bottle beers (budweiser), you can have as many drinks as you like - no restrictions. A small selection of nibbles is also served each night, olives, houmous, flat bread, cheese, grapes, strawberries and sandwiches. We enjoyed this 3 nights out of the 4 which we stayed there. The only negative thing I would mention is the choice of music for both breakfast and the happy hour. It seems to be the same CD (dance music) which is played and possibly wouldn't appeal to all - maybe change it to something a little softer, particularly at breakfast. The lobby/reception area is well kept and always manned. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Checking in and out was quick. Check in is 4pm and out is 11am.

We have experienced more flexibility at other hotels but this was a minor irritation. Good selection of free TV movies for when you get too tired to walk any more. Great location 60m from Times Square and other attractions are within walking distance. New York was enjoyable and plenty of friendly help on the street to get where we wanted to go. Hotel is close to Grand Central Station and the Port Authority where you can catch the bus to the airport. The subway was also close by. An added value for the hotel was the free drinks and snacks between 5-00pm and 7-pm each evening where you could meet other travellers and swap stories. Continental breakfast was adequate but the seating in club chairs around small coffee tables was odd but the food fresh and healthy and plenty of it. A small point was the noisy aircon on entering the room that became quiet when the set room temperature was reached. We liked that you could open the windows in the room as well. Plenty of food outlets close by and a nice market at Grand Central station for anyone looking for some snacks. Library and park just around the corner which was great in the warm weather for somewhere to sit and relax and watch NY in action.","Melbourne, Australia","SBTravel2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",12,4.0

Our flight got in a bit late and caused us to arrive at the hotel at close to 1am. Upon check in we were notified that we would have to wait as our room wasn't ready yet. At 1am!?! What if we arrived closer to 4pm - the one check in began!? The man at the desk then told us that we might be able to move to a higher floor the following day. Fine - we go to the room, my husband prepared to shower and I walked into the bathroom to see this (see photo) on the ceiling - I'm no expert but a hotel room costing more than $450 per night should not have black mold in the shower. The following morning, as directed by the night manager, we called and asked to be moved due to the room conditions (mold, no tissues, no soap). The woman whom my husband spoke to said ""it might be possible but wasn't guaranteed"". Fine - we left the hotel for sight seeing (that's why we were here in the first place). After a long day of exploring, we returned to the hotel and asked about the possibility to move. The woman at the front desk was rude, abrasive and scolded us for not packing our things so they could move us while we were out. She threatened that they were about to give our new room away. First, no one told us we were to pack our things. Second, the woman my husband spoke with didn't say we would even get another room. Thankfully a very, very nice gentleman got us set up with a new room and offered to pass on our experience to the manager. The new room was fine - no mold, had soap etc. and the front desk man was able to relay our experience to the manager. While we never heard from the manager, we were comped one nights stay. While we appreciate the accommodation, it doesn't erase the attitude of the woman at the front desk. The Premier Hotel should consider reprimanding such actions.

The Premier Hotel looked really good on paper and the Trip Advisor reviews were very complimentary. All I can say is that they weren't wrong. I couldn't recommend this hotel more highly. Yes it is always going to be expensive to stay right at the heart of the action in NYC, but I felt this hotel was fantastic value and well worth it.Firstly the service was outstanding, especially Kevin on the concierge who was so nice and so helpful, nothing was a problem. All the staff were so friendly and helpful and genuinely seemed interested in you and your visit to NYC.The complimentary bar and snacks in the evening were fabulous, there was a choice of red and white wine, lager and soft drinks along with an array of fruit, bread, dips, cheeses, salad, olives etc. Amazing and this happy hour (I think it was 5pm-7pm) was just about to start as we checked in, perfect! This was on every evening and was very welcomed after a long day sight seeing. The happy hour staff were also very friendly and accommodating. There was one gentleman (I didn't catch his name) who always had a big smile on his face and made you feel so special. One quieter evening my mum and i were just finishing up our drinks (the happy hour had finished at this point) and he came over to say he still had some beers left if we would like one more before we went for dinner, how nice!! The same room is used for the (also) complimentary breakfast in the morning which we tried a few times and it was very nice (cereals, juice, pastries, coffee, bread etc). The room isn't the largest but considering there was usually only one member of staff on you hardly ever saw any dirty tables or anything running out. Some of the furniture maybe needed some attention but that is my only slight niggle. Out room was surprisingly big (as I had heard NYC rooms could be very small). There was plenty of room for 2 people to live comfortably, it was modern, spacious and clean. The bed was very comfortable, there was lots of storage and room to put your cases. The bathroom was huge with a tub and a separate shower. I loved the robes, slippers and toiletries provided. There was a small area with a couch and a TV (which moved round so you could watch it from the bed). We had a view of Times Square and the coffee maker and water was replenished daily. There was also a turn down serviced which really added that extra touch.The location of the hotel is fabulous. You literally turn right and walk not even half a block and you are in Times Square (our room was about half way up and we never had any problems with noise). So perfect for all the sight seeing we wanted to do (its right near the Good Morning America studio). It was amazing to walk out onto Times Square each day, it never got old (even slightly!). So a great location for everything really, the theatre district, sight seeing tours, shopping etc. You really are in the heart of Times Square (which is exactly what I wanted!).There is a small Irish bar (O'Donoghues) over the road from the hotel that we frequented more than a few nights, good service, music and prices. So if your looking for a great hotel, with great service and great rooms book here. If I ever get the chance to go to NYC again I will certainly 100% be staying here.","Manchester, United Kingdom","MissCJB22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",4,5.0

Free continental breakfast was a bit sparse but still OK. It was ""hidden"" in the sense that there is almost no signage for it on 44th street.

I want to cover a few points first before I get to what I thought was the most important feature. The hotel is perfectly located less than a half block from Times Square. The rooms are a nice size particularly the bathroom which has both a tub and separate shower. We were very surprised how quiet the rooms were being located so close to such a busy area. The continental breakfast in the morning is certainly adequate to get a good start with fruit , pastries, hard boiled eggs, etc. The evening cocktail hour with wine and beer and an assortment of cheeses and other snacks was enjoyable. What I thought really made this hotel exceptional was the service. I think the hotel has about 140 rooms, but you were treated as if you were the only guest. Monique at the front desk was wonderful and served as a great concierge providing great suggestions and directions. Housekeeping was excellent and always met our needs. Finally, I want to mention Mohi who worked at breakfast and the cocktail hour. It is so nice to see someone take such pride in his work . Although he was usually maintaining a room with 30 plus people making sure there was adequate food and tables were cleared, he always made you feel that you were his only guest. All of the staff went out of the way to make you feel welcome. I doubt we will ever seek another hotel when we visit New York.","Middleton, Wisconsin","jamessG1695IR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Middleton, Wisconsin</strong>",112,5.0

Arrived around 1pm. Couldn't check in til 4pm. For me this is a late check in time. Left cases with reception and walked to the iconic red steps of Times Square. This took 4 minutes to walk (slowly!)We had a king room on 3rd floor. No view but great room. I have stayed in NYC before and this room was twice as large as my previous stay. I could easily swing a cat in the bathroom. Bath and separate shower. Good water power and temperature. Room has tea/coffee maker. Hair dryer. Free safe. TV. Alarm clock. Free bottled water. Iron and ironing board, hangers and umbrella. Amply draw and hanging space. Bed and 5 pillows very comfortable. A little bit outside noise but nothing to moan about. Free wi-fi if very strong. Never dropped out at all. Air con looked simple to use but I couldn't work out how to turn it off. Again if I had asked I know they would have shown me. Maybe a little 'how to use' card by it would help for us blondes. I had read mixed comments about the FREE breakfast, but it's terrific. A great way to start the day. Toast, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, cereals, pastries, etc. Guys working this room are great. Ok so there's not an abundance of chairs. Maybe 30. They let you take your food and drink out so have breakfast in your large room if it's too busy. Or grab a coffee in a take out cup and a croissant! Cant understand how people moan about stuff like this. It's all great!! They also have free alcoholic/soft drinks and nibbles early evening but we never used this. Awesome touch tho!All the staff I met were fantastic. Always more than happy to help. Lifts and room doors have a safe swipe access Maid service daily, fresh towels and toiletries replenished even if you only used a tiny bit. It was a little odd that there was only one bathrobe and 1 pair of slippers in a double room. But we never used 1, so had no need for 2. I am positive if we had asked we could have got another one.Location of this hotel is fantastic. Close to bus, train, underground and of course times square. Although the hotel is on 44th, you can walk through the Millennium hotel to get to 45th and the the carpark opposite to get to 43rd (where you must go see Beautiful)I am not one to go searching for dirt or looking for faults/problems in a hotel, but I dropped something on the floor in the room and wouldn't fancy crawling under the bed!

And he was right, it was great. Our room was much larger than expected, very clean, had a wall of windows with the most incredible view.....of the New Year's Eve Crystal Ball. I love hotels that take sheets and wrap a duvet so that you have a pristine clean cover on the bed.... Not like those yucky bedspreads you find in hotels. The bed was comfortable as was the sofa and the tv could easily be swiveled from sofa to bed. It had a large desk area and the thermostat which was on the desk wall was easy to adjust. Fresh bottle of water in the room. The bath had a deep tub and separate shower. Plenty of bath supplies as well as a weight scale....which we didn't use in light of that incredible French meal. Quality wood hangers for your clothes, a safe for valuables, Keurig coffee maker and even an umbrella if it rains were all available.

I did not want to mess up this special occasion, but still had to stay within the budget). We stayed three nights over the weekend. The hotel is literally 2 min walking distance to Times Square. This district is a very busy area with thousands of tourists crowding the streets. However, the hotel itself is somewhat isolated from it. We did not have any problems with noise at all. I intentionally chose this location to stay close to the Theater District, but if not for that, I'd probably choose a less chaotic location in Manhattan.The hotel is well maintained, clean and comfortable. The room was very spacious, larger than expected. The size of the room is comparable to mid level chain hotel rooms you find everywhere in suburbia. This is large for NY in my opinion. The room was next to the elevator, but again, no noise issues. Bed was comfortable, everything was clean. A few spots on somewhat dated carpet in the room and hallway, but really nothing major. Bathroom was really spacious, it had both shower and a bathtub. Water flow was good, water was hot, all faucets were working fine. The sink had a cosmetic hairline crack, I did not affect the use of it. I thought that sink ought to be replaced from an aesthetic point of view, but I would not dwell on it. My wife was using a hairdryer, this apparently blew a fuse and the lights went out in the bathroom, but I fixed it really quick by pushing reset button once I figured what happened. Breakfast was really good. At the check in they said somewhat apologetically it was only a continental breakfast. Well, it was good for continental breakfast. Was certainly sufficient to get me through lunch during busy day of exploring NY attractions. The lobby looks a little odd, it seemed like a few desks were simply put on the floor, computer screens were added, and voila, lobby is ready. But I am really being picky now.

I hope management reads this review and make a few small corrections to make their guests' stay even more comfortable.The Premier Hotel is ideally located right next to Times Square - in fact I could see the famous New Years Eve Ball from my hotel room window. I often am in NY for business and being in Midtown makes it easy to get to all my meetings and see a show when I have the freetime. Because of this reason, I would rebook the Premier.However, there were some minor problems that made me not enjoy my stay 100%. The AC unit in my room made an annoying rattle noise that kept me awake until I decided to put in ear plugs. The street noise level was not heard, but inside the room it was so annoying. I was in room 919. Secondly, I was blessed with permission to have late check-out as I needed to sleep in longer than normal. Unfortunately the front desk did not alert house keeping and I was rudely woken up by the maid. She was rude and told me I had to get out. When I explained that I was granted late check-out, she didn't believe me and said I needed to get out of the room. I told her to check with the front desk and slammed my door. It was unacceptable to be treated like this.

No power outlets near bed side tables.- we called up the reception and asked how to solve this problem , all 4 star hotels have either a power outlet or provide an extension cord. They said we can't do anything point black. Rude 2. No tea coffee maker - I found this rather silly. They don't offer it and upon asking said we can't provide it. How are you a 4 star hotel ??? 3 star hotels also provide this 3. No mini bar in room - they said if you want we can provide you a fridge at a daily rental!! Like seriously ! Your hotel is a sham. Which 4 star hotel doesn't have a in room mini bar ? 4. Courtesy of staff - the reception is always empty no one at front desk. They are so busy at the back doing whatever . Even if you want any help they always say no for mostly everything.5. Drinking water - so one bottle was kept in room free of cost, we asked do we get more during the stay?

Having stayed lived in the upper east side for a few months, I know my way around but for the sake of a touristy few days, wanted something near to the buzz of Times Square! Found this gem - sounded too good to be true at first but upon arrival, realised it was as good as it sounded!Kevin helped us check in - really lovely, asked about our journey and plans, made us feel very welcome.Room was on the 3rd floor and was enormous! Only 2 of us staying, but plenty of room and a good view. Room had a complementary tea and coffee maker, 2 bottles of water, full size iron, ironing board, hair dryer, safe. Bathroom had a shower and tub, shower a bit on the small side but hot and clean so it didn't matter. Also a good size tv and radio, plenty of space to relax in the arm chairs provided in the room. Housekeeping also great, weather was super hot while we were there so every day someone knocked to offer fresh towels just in case we had already used the clean towels given in the morning!Breakfast from 7-10am was included which was a god send as we all know how expensive NYC can be. Served in a small mezzanine area with a TV. Bagels, croissants, toast, yoghurt, fruit, cereal and tea/coffee. All you really need! And the staff are so lovely!! Happy to help or stop and chat. Makes a huge difference! Happy hour and snacks are also included and served from 5-7pm, cheese, olives, ham and fruit, with soft drinks, tea/coffee or beer/wine! At first we weren't sure if we needed to go, but after sampling it on the first day, realised that it was the perfect way to relax and refuel before going out for a show or late dinner. Finally the location - Times Square is less than a 30 second walk, all the theatres for shows are scattered around (took us about 10mins to walk to the August Wilson theatre for jersey boys) Rockefeller centre is a 5 min walk as is grand central station. Macy's, Empire State Building, saks etc all around 10 mins away. Fantastic location! Would highly recommend this hotel to anyone planning a trip, and will definitely be going back!

Also coffee machine was a bit basic and feel a kettle would have been better as it was difficult to fill the water tank to get a decent size coffee dispensed. Room was cold, even when the air con was set at 80F, it was blowing cool air and as the outside temperature was very low for May and no sign of the sun, it was a little too cold for comfort, particularly for my daughter who ended up sleeping in one of my jumpers.

If I could, I would rate it a 3.5 (between good and great) but without that option, rounded up to a 4. The service was good, the room on the larger side and appeared newly updated, and the inclusive breakfast was great (on a par with Hotel Casablanca also in the same area). Things not at the 4-5 level: the bathroom was nice but not as luxurious as some in the 4-5 range. The shower was very small and you could see the wear and tear of an older but updated bathroom with stained caulking in corners, etc. The more modern, Scandinavian-type furniture was also newer but I found the protruding platform bed frame to be annoying and hit my knee on the extended corners more than once (be careful if you use the bathroom at night and don't turn on lights). And it happened to be a humid, warmer day in April so I had the air-conditioning on but the condenser never kicked in so the fan just blew the humid, warmer air around all night. I was able to open windows though and that did help.Ending my stay with a very nice, continental-style breakfast on the mezzanine level (hard boiled eggs, bagel/pastry options, cold cereal, fruit etc.) was very nice and an added value to the stay.Overall, the Premier Hotel won't blow you away but, if you get a good deal (check the sties often) you won't feel like you got taken advantage of either and will have found a decent option in the Times Square area.","Tinton Falls, New Jersey","Gregory M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tinton Falls, New Jersey</strong>",15,4.0

It is about a 4 minute walk to the TKTS booth in Times Square and about the same distance to the subway on 42nd street, so really a fabulous location from which to explore NYC. The taxi driver had a bit of difficulty finding the hotel, even though I had spotted the sign on the building he kept telling me it was the Millenium. I eventually had to explain that the Premier is like it's smaller sibling. Eventually I entered the reception area. Keep in mind the entrance is not directly facing 44th st - facing the street is a large window, with the revolving door just to the side, offering a bit of protection from the foot traffic. The room was great - much bigger than many other places I have stayed (in a similar position with regards to Times Square). As you entered the room there was an alcove to the left with a wardrobe (containing a safe) and a small table with the coffee maker on it. To the right was the bathroom which was bigger than my ensuite at home with a large bath tub, separate shower and plenty of bench space, hooks and rails. The main room was almost in an L-shape with a narrow but functional desk and the bed in one section and a sofa in the other part, separated by a flat screen tv that could be swivelled from one side to the other. The bed was plush and supremely comfortable and the pillows were good too. You could control the temperature of your room with the wall mounted control, which was perfect. I had asked for a 'quiet room away from lifts and service areas' which I did get. I was facing the back of the hotel so heard virtually no street noise but was directly opposite the air-conditioning units of the buildings behind, which were a bit noisy, but given the proximity of everything in NYC can't be helped. The other bonus was that breakfast was included - the usual selection of fruit salad (pineapple, rockmelon and honeydew), boiled eggs, breads/bagels/pastries with juice, tea and coffee as well. In the evenings there was a happy hour from 5-7pm where they served wine (cab sav was delicious) and various antipasto dishes as well, which sometimes could suffice for dinner, making the hotel even more economical overall. I wouldn't hesitate to book here again next time I was in town, providing that the price stays reasonable.",,Seabird21,279,5.0

On first impressions when we arrived, it didn't seem like a hotel as there is no usual reception area; the check-in desks looked like they should appear in an internet cafe, not a hotel. However, the decor and feel did seem nice.Check-in. We were the only ones waiting, excellent, and we were checked in within minutes, excellent, again. However, the only words the man behind the desk said were; ""What's your name?"" and ""Can I have a credit card for the file?"". There was no attempt at being polite and even more annoying, he did not give us any further information on the hotel other than our room number. One thing to note here, we were charged $100 deposit, which is probably standard procedure, but no one told us we needed to pay this. I didn't notice until I checked my credit card later in the week. We did get it back once we had checked out though.Luckily, the bellboy, David, was a lot more forthcoming and offered us more information about the hotel, for example, where we needed to go for breakfast. He also gave us a quick tour of our room and made sure we were settled in nicely.The rooms. We were very impressed with the room we got. It was very spacious and the bathroom was much bigger than expected. There were plenty of power outlets and lighting. However, one annoyance was that whenever we turned the bedside light out it also cut all electric to the TV, meaning we needed the lights on to watch it. The view wasn't great, but nothing we didn't expect before arriving. The best thing about the room though was the comfortable beds and cleanliness. I got a good nights sleep every night and the maid did a good job of cleaning and tidying every day.Breakfast. Average at best. On our first morning, we were greeted by a hotel employee who insisted on questioning us about whether we were staying at the hotel. After convincing him we were we moved into the breakfast area. The only way I can describe it is; like a waiting room, a few chairs and low coffee tables. The only thing missing was a selection of magazines on the tables. So there was nowhere to lean to eat your food, unless you fancy hunching right over the low tables. Further to this, the food was completely average. There wasn't a massive selection and the quality wasn't great either. Other than breakfast and our rooms we didn't have much interaction with the hotel until it was time to leave.Location. Amazing! If you want to be in the middle of things on Time Square, this is definitely one of the best places to stay. We also came across some very good places to eat and drink a few blocks out to the east and west.Last day and check out. Check out was simple and quick. We also needed to leave our bags in storage, which was also simple. However, the interaction with the receptionists and bellboys throughout the last day was hard work. They answered the questions we had and were helpful, but they all spoke to us in rude and sarcastic tones. It was as if they wanted to just get rid of us quickly and we were disturbing them from something important. Everything they did and said seemed to be with huge reluctance. When it came to leaving, we struggled to get a cab, but instead of the bellboy from this hotel coming to try and help, we had to rely on a bellboy from a neighbouring hotel to help. He managed to sort a hotel car for us in the end.With the exception of the bellboy on arrival, all staff we encountered were quite rude. This kind of service didn't stop there, we encountered this quite often when travelling around Manhattan during our stay. This was not the case with everyone, however.Despite the level of service, I would consider staying here again just for the rooms and location alone and at least I would book knowing that customer service isn't the hotels strength and I would keep my interaction with them to a minimum. However, the customer service does need to be addressed and greatly improved.

The bathrooms are very tired and can do with a renovation, and the shower curtain must go ... a 4* hotels should definitely not have shower curtains, very unhygienic ! Generally, the room could do with a refresh and the carpet looks like it had seen better days. Rooms are a good size for NY, and very quiet considering the location - our room faced the street, only some occasional delivery truck noise in the early hours. The breakfast room small and crowded but provided a basic continental breakfast - good for toast and coffee before heading out. There are plenty of cafes and diners near by so it's not essential to get the bf included rate. The Itallian Restaurant across the road is fantastic and worth a try for dinner, and the Red Flame Diner further along W44th (1 block along) is just amazing for breakfast-brunch-lunch-supper.The location is also just a tad bit too close to the Time Square crowds, better to be a couple of blocks south around Bryant Square and not have to fight the crowds every time you depart or return to the hotel. If we had to do it again, we would probably choose somewhere else as we feel we did not get fair value for what we paid. Last time we stayed 1 block along W44th at the Iroquois Hotel for a similar price and we got better hotel service, nicer room and better location.","Melbourne, Australia","SeaDreaming22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",174,3.0

Didn't annoy my spouse but it kept me awake, and I didn't realize I could turn it off until early AM hours, just an FYI - probably would affect only 0.01% of the population other than me. 2) This is the one star difference: WTH with charging $50 for early check in? (2 Hours) - for god's sake if the room is clean and ready, what is the problem? Check in is 4PM. it's an odd late hour and if you want your room earlier because you have an event...it's $50, I find that a little extreme.","Central Islip, New York","moandpebs</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Central Islip, New York</strong>",34,4.0

It was my first time going to New York City so was very nervous about where to stay. We found this hotel on Expedia and came highly recommend. The rooms were spacious and had lovely views of the city, they were very modern and clean the maid came every morning to clean the room and we had a courtesy knock every evening to see if we wanted our beds made up. The bathroom was big with a nice deep sink bath and powerful shower with clean towels daily. There was hardly any noise at night except one morning when we had 3 helicopters over head hovering for an hour but hey that's just city life. The people were helpful at the front desk and very friendly welcoming you every time you came in. You get a complimentary breakfast included and you also get free drinks and nibbles in the evening which is such a nice touch as it saves you a lot of money going out looking for breakfast. The seating area isn't huge but in the whole 7 days we didn't have trouble finding seats and there is a large selection of fresh fruit to cereal muffins toast etc. Evening drinks (5-7pm) are free including wine beer and soft drinks. All served by very friendly staff. Again after a long day in the city a cold beer goes down nicely. Overall I couldn't fault the hotel or staff at allIt's nice, clean, friendly and 30 second walk from time square and also very close to a lot of other big attractions. My only negative is when we checked out there was no one one the front desk, we had a taxi outside waiting and I couldn't find anyone to check out with and ended up running around trying to find someone eventually finding a lady who took my keys and said she'd give them in as the chap had probably gone to the toilet (it was 4am) I would have like to have said thank you for our stay and that we had a really nice time. So if management read this thank you for a lovely time we'd highly recommend this hotel and we're sorry we didn't get to say goodbye Jordan (room 625) Cornwall England ","Truro, United Kingdom","jordanb398</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Truro, United Kingdom</strong>",9,5.0

I booked a room for two people, but the room was definitely displayed for one guest. There was one robe in the room that had makeup smears (at least I presume) all over it, so we did not use it. The pictures made it look like there was a couch but there was just one chair in front of the tv, that could only fit one. The comforter also had stains on it, and we called down to have it exchanged. Someone was sent to the room but they just gave us an extra comforter folded on top of our bed without changing the linens so we made our own bed and removed the dirty stained linens by ourselves. The only reason Im giving it a three is because of the included happy hour. But would most likely not stay here again.

Its theater district location provides a plethora of options for entertainment and fine dining in nearby Hell's Kitchen. Unfortunately, the hotel itself is a major miss, especially for one rated 4.5-stars by Hotwire. Upon registration, I was informed that a mandatory early check-in fee will be charged even if there are available rooms. I had no issues with that, except that I could not immediately get into my room and enjoy early check in because the elevators were not working. I waited for a long time in the lobby as the front desk clerk ('Kevin'), his manager, and several maintenance staff milled around the elevator area dumbfounded and panicked about what to do with the problem. In the mean time, irate guests streamed down the staircase into the front desk complaining about being trapped on their floor for a long time. They also complained about the information blackout as there were no communication made whatsoever about a potentially serious maintenance issue, and phone calls to security and front desk about the matter were being ignored. After waiting in the lobby for a while, the manager finally told me I had to take the service elevator to my floor. He did not know when the guest elevators will be back up and running. Luggages in tow, I had to navigate my way through exposed cables and miscellaneous debris in the dimly lit warehouse area where the service elevator is located. The guest room itself is clean and the bed comfortable. In the bathroom, however, the bathtub faucet handle laid on the floor of the tub. I reported the problem and the following day, the handle was reunited with the faucet but immediately detached itself upon touch as nobody bothered to permanently screw it to the handle assembly. It was never properly fixed. On my final evening, I requested for ice to be delivered as there was no ice machine on the floor. Again, phone calls to front desk (I knew 'Kevin' was there as I saw him on my way up to my room), housekeeping, or the bar area were ignored.The lone star goes to the cleaning person on my floor who did a fantastic job keeping the room tidy. Her friendliness and ability to make guests feel welcome are superior to the those unfortunately tasked with initial customer contact.This so-called boutique hotel does not live up to its premier moniker. I suggest taking your business and hard-earned $$$ elsewhere when booking a hotel in NYC.","New York City, New York","geoarc99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",18,1.0

We booked trips via a well known company called Gray Line so that we had guides to show us round all the famous sites of NYC including the river cruise to see the Statue of Liberty & lunch in Little Italy, for $98 it was well worth it. In the evenings we dined out and found an amazing restaurant called Guys American Kitchen & Bar situated on West 44th Street a 5min walk from the hotel. The food was delicious and service superb. Guy can be seen on the Food Network in his show Diners, Drive-ins & Dives. We also managed to catch a few shows including Motown the Musical and the Illusionists, both were absolutely fantastic.

Breakfast and Wine Hour are nothing special , go to a restaurant for a better breakfast. Our stay had several issues that prevents me from giving a higher rating . First of all our arrival was very early, before 10 am. I contacted the hotel before hand to let them know and asked for a room iif possible, I knew we could at least store our luggage. When we arrived we met Monique who had some glowing reviews here but for me not so much. We waited a good 10 minutes before she acknowledge us, while cleaning her desk and speaking on the phone . Finally we were told that no rooms would be available till 4 pm however we could pay $50 dollars for a early check in. I am not sure if a room would miraculously appear or what but after paying a good side of $300 for a night the additional money seem a bit steep. I also found this strange since she didn't even check our reservations. So we went shopping left our luggage, we returned about 1 pm and still no room, Monique told us one should be ready shortly and about an hour later we had our room , no view just rooftops. The next problem was At night when I turned down the bed, there was a small tear in the sheet, I could live with that, then the entire bottom of the bed was short sheeted and finally a large glob of hair on the sheet. Yikes! I took pictures and showed the concierge, who called housekeeping and the bed was remade. We were offered the opportunity to move rooms but we were already settled. Finally I called for ice and this was never delivered. For what it's worth the staff is friendly . I just can't recommend this place with the ridiculous upsell for early check in and sloppy housekeeping .",Michigan,"wallybeary</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Michigan</strong>",41,3.0

On vacation, I got to the hotel 2 hrs. early. When asking about check in, the concierge tried to upsale me by suggesting I could pay $50 for the privilege. Very questionable practice for any hotel but particularly a purported quality hotel. Upon checking in room, I noticed peeling wall paper and stained carpet. See pics. Questionable for even a 3 star but for a 4 star, unacceptable. Only being there one night, I thought to let it go and just not use them in the future. However, when I went to the rest room there was urine on the seat and a pubic hair, as well. The tub had some kind of soil, also. See pics. To their credit they changed my room, but with the same result. The toilet had urine stains. The third room had blood on the toilet. It was a small amount (see pics) but a small amount of a blood-borne pathogen is not ok. At this point, I asked if someone could just come clean because it obviously wasn't getting better. The manager graciously gave me a breakfast voucher and I appreciated the thought, but I had paid for breakfast with my room. Btw, they supposedly gave me their best room after these incidents. I had to crawl under the bed to charge my phone because (see pic) the other wall outlet in the room didn't work. Call me choosy, but being away from home, I want my phone in the room with me. The problem with Premier location makes it 2 stars. It misses the mark in two key areas cleanliness and safety. Further customer service began with an attempt to upsale me. Staying at Premier took precious time away and I had to work around the failures of the brand to enjoy myself. That doesn't happen at quality hotels. I would suggest looking at other options outside of the Premier/Millennium Brand.Their location is wonderful. It's alongside some good restaurants and two blocks from the action of Times Square and subways. Additionally, they had a very nice reception on Sat night. Unfortunately, their standard of cleaning, lack of eye for details and the upsale attempt makes their brand questionable for me.","Virginia Beach,Va","TWorldraveler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia Beach,Va</strong>",9,1.0

From the 7th floor I could see parts of Times Square with no street noise. If I had a room on a higher floor I might have had a better view but it was not a problem. The room itself was larger than I expected as I had been warned that rooms in NYC were small but not a bit of it! Very clean with everything I could need. Breakfast was more than adequate and the evening reception was a pleasant bonus. My only gripe was that midway through my stay the maid stopped leaving out the complementary bathroom items. I am not sure if this was because I had been leaving only a dollar bill on my pillow as a tip but it lasted for a couple of days. It was my first time in NYC ..the States actually..and I was not used to the tipping culture which we don't have in the UK. For whatever reason it made me feel uncomfortable and while not enough for me to dock a star this would not be an honest review if I did not mention it. The tipping culture is a pain for those not used to it and hotel staff should be aware of this.Otherwise great and I would absolutely book at the Premier if I was to return to NYC. ,"Billericay, United Kingdom","PhilBillericay_Essex</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Billericay, United Kingdom</strong>",14,5.0

When we arrived, our room was not available, so we were upgraded to the room one of the owners uses when he is in town. We arrived late, so were very tired. That whole situation could have turned ugly really fast, but was just the opposite. Talk about location. Our view was of the ball drop site on Times Square. We were 1/2 block from all the craziness, but the hotel was very quiet. A perfect central location to everything. The front desk staff were amazing, particularly the gentleman working the desk at night. He went out of his way to make us feel special, including getting us VIP seating at this great Italian restaurant across the street. This was all before he knew it was my birthday.From this location, you can get the hop-on, hop-off bus which I highly recommend as a way to see all the sites, but not as a mode of transportation. It is too slow and some stops are unmarked and unclear. The hotel is also walking distance to Broadway shows, good food, and Rockefeller Center. Be sure to go to the Top of the Rock. You can get off the hop on bus at Central Park to get a carriage ride. It's worth the price at least once. Be sure to ask them to stop at Strawberry Fields. Negotiate a price before you get on. We had champagne and a cheese platter at The Plaza across the street. Ok, it is ridiculously priced, but come on, you're at The Plaza. It's worth it. I did high tea once before. That was great too. The Met is an absolute must, but give yourself a minimum of 3 hours. Really, you could easily spend days. A show or two is a must, and taking the ferry to Ellis Island and the Statue are a must.

I have stayed in a couple NYC hotels, and this one was by far the cleanest, quietest, and friendliest. It is in a great location next to Times Square and the theater district. There are only six rooms per floor, which keeps the noise level down. The rooms are very spacious with a king bed, small sofa, modern TV, and separate tub and shower. The only complaint I have is when I arrived I had to wait to check in with one clerk while the other clerk sat next to him, at the desk, and openly complained about her not getting paid for working on Sunday. Those types of conversations should not be had in front of customers. Outside of this, the hotel was the utmost in professionalism and helpfulness.Things to note: It is attached to the Millennium Broadway Hotel as well as a Broadway theater. At night, the door into the Premiere is closed and you have to enter through the Millennium. It's not far, just remember it for those late nights!

The ""happy hour"" was nothing special on the concierge level; I've experienced others that are 10x better. 2 choices of wine, a few beer choices and just ordinary snacks, like chips and humus dip. What really annoyed me was the maid. She was there at 8am each morning, knocking on the door. My business was a lunch appointment. Then, on checkout day, I wanted to work from the room in the morning. Again, knocking at the door. Then a phone call from the desk at 11:05am asking if I was checking out soon; the maid is waiting to clean the room, they said. I said I was packing at that moment. Then at 11:10am another call asking the same thing and telling me checkout is at 11am. I'm looking at my confirmation right now, and it says that checkout is at 12:00pm.

We were unable to check-in early but they were happy to store our luggage. When we did check-in, we were told about the free cocktail hour as well as free breakfast, things we were not expecting.The elevator requires a room key, a nice security measure. The Premier is a smaller hotel, with only about six rooms on each floor. Our room was pretty big for NYC standards. On the left was a dry bar and a walk-in closet. To the right was a full bathroom with separate shower and tub. Straight ahead was an elevated queen bed with a desk and chair to one side. Opposite the bed was a couch with chez lounge and an HDTV.We slept well thanks to the quiet central style air conditioning. The happy hour did not disappoint. There was free beer, wine, and soft drinks as well as sandwiches and snacks. The bartender was happy to refill our drinks and clear our table. Breakfast featured hard-boiled eggs, fresh fruit, cereal, pastries, toast, coffee, and juice.

I was greeted when I walked in and was pleasantly suprised when I was told that my room was on the Premier side,so I headed next door. The check-in process over there was smooth and quick and more personal,you sit down in a chair as your being checked in. I was upstairs in my room in no time which was on the 18th floor.My room was a nice size and very inviting with a work area, and sofas. Bathroom was a good size with a separate bathtub and shower and very clean. I left my room about an hour later to go see the show and I was surprised that the desk clerk remembered me by name and wished me a good evening,very good customer service. There are plenty of places to eat nearby as well as in the hotel itself.I would definitely stay at this hotel again, great rooms and great service.

I had booked a corner room at the Millennium Broadway, hoping for a view of Times Square. When I arrived I was told I had been upgraded to the Premier. You go through a set of doors from the Millennium into the Premier's lobby (it also has a separate entrance on 44th Street).It feels like a different world the moment you step through the doors. The lobby at the Millennium bustles with activity. The Premier is serene. There is no front desk, just two desks where the front desk staff checks you in. It feels like a discreet private club. When I arrived I had a short wait, so I sat on a sofa and had some water with lemon (there is a supply kept handy in the lobby to refresh weary guests). My check-in was quick, and I had a pleasant conversation with the agent. My room was on he tenth floor, immediately adjacent to the elevator. I worried that it might be noisy, but it was not. The room itself was spacious, with a small sectional, a comfortable bed and a desk. The bathroom was large, and it took me a day to realize that there was a separate shower hiding behind the bathroom door. There was a large display area for a piece of sculpture or a flower vase or something, but it was empty. It was just an odd detail in an otherwise fine room. Now, if I did gymnastics, I could see a slice of Times Square from the large windows in my room. The view was mostly typical New York, water towers and buildings, pleasing in its own way but not what I had been expecting for the weekend. I got over it fairly quickly because I was literally just a couple hundred steps from the action. The hotel itself continued to provide great service. In the evenings there is a complimentary wine reception on the mezzanine level, and there is a continental breakfast there in the mornings. All in all, this was a great stay close to the action of Broadway.

This is a huge asset as traffic is a chaos day and night. The price is reasonable comparing to other places at that location.The stuff was friendly, the room was very modern and clean, spectacular view from the window. No street noise.

First of all, this is a wonderful location if you want to be right in Times Square and close to a bunch of main attractions and subway stations. The first day we got there we were told to go to the ""Premier"" side and I was unsure whether that was an upgrade or not. We arrived around 10am but we were able to check in early which was nice. The check in counter staff wasn't super friendly and she seemed to want to rush us away from the counter. The room was nice and was always clean when we got back from a day of exploring. Overall the stay was ok. I think the thing that threw me off was the staff. They never really acknowledged that we were there or that we were guests. Never smiled or greeted us and didn't even say bye when we were leaving. If you stay here keep in mind that it's best if you want to be 30 seconds away from Times Square but you won't get decent service here.

Others in our family group had rooms in main hotel and were told although they were early - before 4 pm check in time, they would have their room ready in about a half hour. They were very nice. The front desk in the 'upgraded' Premier were not helpful, indifferent and with a bad attitude. Despite being the only people there, we were brusquely told to 'come' back after 4, we were early. When we explained we had plans later and it would really help to check in before 4 they offered no help. I said don't you want our name so you know we are here and can assign a room they said no. I had to insist they check to be sure they had our name in their system because my confidence was rapidly fading. My wife went back and got a room assigned later - before 4 - but it was on the second floor and windows never got direct sunlight and overlooked low rooftops, mechanical equipment and fire escapes - lovely. Probably done intentionally I'm thinking. We had to call 5 times to get a toilet fixed that malfunctioned the second day we were there. There regular staff were nice - but Front Desk were horrible.

The continental breakfast the next morning offered pastries, cereal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, fruit, bagels, coffee, espresso and fruit juice.The location is fabulous - you are right in Times Square and everything is so accessible.

We have saved for many years to visit NYC and did not want to be disappointed after all the planning and dreaming about it. We booked with Expedia.There were a few hotels shortlisted but we settled on the Premier Hotel mainly because of the great Trip advisor reviews and we were not let down by the majority of them.We arrived on the 21st July around 1pm, we were greeted by a very friendly receptionist as checking in wasn't until 4pm she suggested we left our luggage and called the concierge (who was also very friendly) they both told us to enjoy the beautiful day and the shops :D.Checked in with a different receptionist at 4pm who was also very friendly (wish I could remember names)Once we arrived at our room we were pleasantly surprised at how spacious our room was. (We had paid a slight upgrade for a king size bed) Beds are amazingly comfy!!!We had a massive bed with space either side and a little seating area too that looked out onto the street that lead to Times Square (You could almost jump from the hotel to there).As we had been up since 3am we decided to take advantage on the free drinks hour and was amazed that you could also choose branded beer too, also there was an array of dips/olives/crackers/meats etc.At check in the receptionist advised us to have breakfast early so we went at 7.30am and were happy to find a good choice (baring in mind this is a free facility) Cereals, croissants, pastries, fresh fruit, bagels, cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, bread, juices and muffins. Staff were always friendly and cleared items straight away. When we went around 9 one day it was quite full of people and you may struggle to find a seat. We thought we wouldn't have the free breakfast often but we used it 5 times out of 8 as it was more convenient and what more didn't cost a thing apart from a little tip to the staff (which is optional)A little disappointing that we didn't get any milk in our room for Coffee even after requesting it but a good thing to remember is that you are welcome to get one from the machine at anytime and to be honest that is the only fault I can find with this hotel so not a major thing. (we made our own coffee up which seemed to taste better, press the cappuccino option once and then the milk option twice)Room was serviced everyday and was clean throughout our stay, clean towels even when we didn't need them changing. Lift was broke for a little while one day so we decided to take the stairs, I do not recommend this if you are on a higher floor like us as it was very hot and hard work, I'd just wait as it was only out around an hour.Also a thing to remember, if you can't assess the hotel through the normal entrance (locks after a certain time) then you can gain access from their sister hotel Millennium next door, we weren't told this but worked it our for ourselves when it was locked one evening.We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel and would definitely book it again if we can ever save up enough money to visit NYC again.","Warwickshire, United Kingdom","rachie61</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Warwickshire, United Kingdom</strong>",7,5.0

Breakfast was adequate and a bit tasteless, if an item runs out that is it for the morning, it does extend to 10 a.m. though for late night theater goers. Wine reception had decent red wine and also small nibbles that disappeared quickly. Eating out is so expensive in NYC both were appreciated. If you are sensitive to noise be sure to pack a set of ear plugs as the rooms at the back of the hotel face out on a very noisy ventilation system for both hotels.

I have never written a review, but after staying at the Premier Hotel in NY for 3 nights, I felt I had to! We arrived to the hotel at around noon, exhausted from our travels from Canada with our bags and 13 week old son in tow. Monique was working the front desk, and was so nice and accommodating. After no more than a 5 minute wait, she checked us in so we could put the baby down for a nap and ensured that we had a room with a slight view at the back of the hotel (quiet for baby!). We were so pleasantly surprised upon entering our room - so spacious, so clean! The room had a queen size bed, couch, and lots of space. The bathroom was equipped with both a tub, and separate shower. There was also a small foyer to the right of the entrance where the closet was located and was a perfect place to store our stroller. A big bonus for us was that continental breakfast was provided every morning. Any one with a baby knows it's hard to get going in the morning, and it was so easy to go downstairs and enjoy a nice, quick breakfast before getting ready. The breakfast was lovely! Cereal, granola, pastries (muffins, cinnamon buns, danishes), yogurt, fresh fruit, toast, coffee and juices. The breakfast is served in a very clean, common seating area with couches and chairs. We met a lot of nice people, and had some great conversations while seated. Finding a seat was never a problem. Another bonus was happy hour between 5-7pm. In past travels, we've never been able to take advantage of happy hour, but we found ourselves back with the baby freshening up. Happy hour is located in the same area as breakfast, however they play soft music and dim the lights. They offer red and white wines, beer and a very nice spread of crackers, cheese, cold cuts and so on. It was really nice to sit back and enjoy a drink away from the hustle and bustle. Now, the best part of this hotel. The LOCATION. It is steps away from Time Square. It's a 20 minute walk from the Empire State Building, the Pier (Intrepid), a 10 minute walk from Fifth Avenue-Madison shopping, Rockefeller Center and so on. It really couldn't be any better - especially for its reasonable price! The staff (Monique, Kevin) were so friendly and accommodating.

The room featured a tub and shower, queen size (very comfortable) bed and all the other amenities you get in a normal hotel room. I could see the New Year's Eve ball from my hotel room. The hotel staff was very helpful and answered any questions we had about sites, shops and transportation in the city.

So much choice - but I would recommend this one to anyone.We stayed for 5 nights and wanted to be close to Times Square and a subway. Location was perfect. 30 second walk from the hustle and bustle of Times Square. We were on the 17th floor with a great view of the famous Times Square 'ball' and couldn't hear any street noise whatsoever.Reception layout is a bit strange and there's no bell - so it took a few minutes before being seen to but once we did Monique was very helpful and friendly giving us a room with a view. Arrived 2 hours before check in but were able to get in our room straight away.After reading so much about NYC hotel rooms being small I was amazed when we entered a huge room with a two seater sofa, coffee table, wardrobe, drink station etc as well as a queen bed. Bathroom also very large with a great shower. All very clean and maids did a great service every day. Bed was comfortable, pillows a bit too high for our liking but after walking around the city we were so tired it made no difference to a great night's sleep. Air con was great and easily controllable. Wi-Fi perfect for whole stay throughout hotel. Never waited more than 30 seconds for the lift.Breakfast was lovely, continental as stated and the fresh fruit was a welcome start to the day for us as we ate typical American fare for our other meals so at least this balanced it out a little!The drinks and snacks on the Mezzanine floor between 5 and 7pm were a great touch, the only downside was the terrible lounge music over the speakers which was so bad but we just took the drinks up to our room instead.This was a great base for us and was very close to Rockafeller Centre (10 mins walk), Central Park/Macy's/Empire State/Grand Central Station all within 15-20 min walk and easily accessible. Got us a taxi within minutes for our trip back to the airport - which was $75 including tip in a comfortable car.Would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in NYC and wanting to be close to a lot of the Midtown sights!Thanks for helping to make our trip so special.","London, United Kingdom","mjade2015</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",9,5.0

The location was awesome. Less than two blocks from Times Square and close to the subway. We got there really early in the morning and they let us leave our bags before check in, no problem. We came back later to check in and the king bed we were promised wasn't available so they offered to transfer us to the Millennium hotel next door, or have a queen the first night and then move us to a king the second night. We opted for the latter option since we wanted to stay in the newer hotel, and take advantage of the free breakfast and happy hours The Premier offered. Kevin could NOT have been any nicer or more helpful. He was awesome. He made notes in the computer so we could explain the situation the next morning and when we tried, the girl at the front desk was not very helpful. We had packed up our bags and left them in the first room like we were told, so they would be moved to a king room by the time we got back. That didn't happen, but thankfully Kevin was at the front desk when we got back and he took care of it right away. He gave us an awesome room with a view of Times Square and wanted to make sure we were taken care of since we were 'such nice people.' The rooms were clean and the bathrooms were nice with great water pressure in the shower. It needs more outlets that aren't hidden though. And you have to call room service to get ice, but they bring it up quickly, albeit just in a plastic bag. The breakfast was definitely a nice perk - pastries, bagels, cereal, yogurts, lots of fruit, coffee, orange and grapefruit juice and hard boiled eggs. Oatmeal or something hot like that seems like a nice easy addition for folks to add some more protein but it's free, and you can take it back to your room, so there's nothing to complain about. We only took advantage of the happy hour once due to our plans but it was nice that it's free. White or red wine and some beer. Some people have said the room is too small to eat or drink in, but there were plenty of seats and it wasn't crammed, so I'm not sure what they mean.

BUT we had booked a King room at the Millenium and ended up in a Queen room at the Premier, a supposedly ""better"" facility. The room was relatively small, thank goodness the suitcases actually fit under the bed or it would have been a very cramped space indeed. BUT our room looked right out onto a section of Times Square and I could take a photo of the big crystal ball right out my window. The facilities were clean and tidy BUT when we came back one evening of our four night stay the room was untouched. A trip back downstairs was met with a chilly ""we'll get on to it when we can"" response without a hint of apology.The night we checked in the desk clerk/manager was a sweetie. He could not have been more friendly and helpful, with good advice about travelling around, etc. BUT other nights a woman on duty was as unfriendly as it is possible to be. The Premier included breakfast and also happy hour. BUT breakfast was supposed to have been included in our I Love New York package originally purchased which included the King bed room. Breakfast....well, there were danish, toast, fruit, cereals, all the usual suspects...BUT a coffee machine that produced just about the worst coffee I have ever tasted. The seating arrangements meant guests often had no place to sit, cleaning up of the area was haphazard at best and non-existent most of the time and the staff seemed to spend the entire six days we were there in deep discussion trying to figure out how to reorganise the set up to make it less convenient. Each morning three of four staff would appear, consulting and gesturing about moving the tiered tray of pastries here or a bowl of boiled eggs there, while the milk ran out, the hot water ran dry and the queues for the toaster mounted. Also amusing and worth watching was happy hour. Red and White wine and beer were available and staff attitudes varied from social to oblivious. Sometimes there were nibbles, cheese, even cold cuts. Other days pretzels and that was it and even those ran out. Time wasn't a factor, but we never worked out quite what the criteria was for what was served or when. There is a two-computer and one printer business centre off the breakfast/happy hour room with free internet and printing. Final assessment. Shop for the best rates and go for a good location. If you want to be right on Times Square, and you plan to be out most of the time, you are looking for a fast and simple breakfast, and you anticipate being back and would like a glass of wine after a long day of sightseeing (between 5-7pm), this is the place for you. Check on special rates and specials in general. The room is small, but then apparently so are most hotel rooms in NYC. You can probably do better, but you could certainly do a lot worse. Would we stay again? I'd check other options, but depending on the rates would stay again because of the great location, right on Times Square and very convenient to the subway. But I think's I'd go for the king room at the Millenium rather than the Queen version at the Premium.","Melbourne, Australia","binduAustralia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",178,3.0

Also to mention the free WIFI which was super fast and available in the room, all in all a perfect stay was had util it was time to check out, we had the misfortune of having to deal with Monique who was quite patronising when we asked about getting a cab to take us to the airport later that day she said that we would struggle to get a taxi at the time we wanted to go as it would be close to rush hour and she couldn't guarantee that we would get one and how there where a lack of Taxi cabs in NYC so all day i was worried about the cab and getting back to the airport due to being ill informed by Monique! when we came back to leave we dealt with someone different and it couldn't have been a more helpful gentleman (I'm only sorry I didn't get his name, as he truly deserves some recognition for his fantastic customer service)! The hotel have there own cars to take guests back to the airport a little bit more expensive but much nicer than a NYC taxi! if only we were told this by Monique earlier that morning our last day would have been enjoyable without any stress or worry, just such a shame that one persons negative and unhelpful attitude can effect someone else's day!

If you were to answer honestly, the answer would be ""infrequently."" Add NYC as the destination, and the answer would probably be ""never."" Well, my husband and I recently traveled to the Big Apple to celebrate our 20th anniversary. Our great fortune was to be welcomed by the incomparable staff of The Premier, on W. 44th St., to toast 20 + years of memories and be given an opportunity to create some fabulous new ones. The Premier has many attributes: 1.) It's located less than 1/2 block from Times Square. 2.) It's an easy walk to all of Broadway's theatrical productions, 5th Ave. shopping,  and Central Park's vast, green space. 3.) Gray Line's sight-seeing options can be purchased on 7th Ave., about a 5-min. walk from the hotel lobby. 4.) Accommodations are modern, clean, and spacious. Breakfast is ample, fresh, and well-presented. The cocktail hour (5-7) offers tasty appetizers and unlimited wine, beer, and/or soft drinks. Great time & place to mingle or relax. 5.) The staff is first-rate! - Hector, the manager, was delightful. We expected professionalism, of course,  but his Latin heritage colored all of our interactions with tremendous warmth  and humor. - Monique, an attractive and charismatic concierge, would be reason enough to return to The Premier. She even graciously escorted us to our departing  shuttle. - Carlos was frequently our host for breakfast and early evening wine-toasting. His friendliness and attention to detail allowed us to feel far- removed from the hustle and bustle of the city streets. - Raymond and Jenny, high-tech skills at the ready, went above and beyond to  assure we were able to access tour vouchers which were purchased on- line  prior to the trip. - Dixon and Carlos (a fellow Peruvian like my husband) were present for a few of of the breakfasts and cocktail hours we attended, as well. Both were engaging, attentive, and professional. Should we ever choose to make NYC our vacation destination again, we will make every effort to return to The Premier, as well.

The breakfast was more than sufficient, with bagels, juice, bread and pastries, cereals, yoghurt, boiled eggs and a selection of fruit. The various evening snacks included such items as fresh asparagus spears, tomato with mozzarella, crisp bread and dips of tzatziki and hummus, to name a few. To be able to begin each day with this hearty breakfast and then to return for a relaxing break for pre-dinner drinks and snacks prior to going out for the evening was a huge plus. The location of this hotel is excellent, not only for exploring the immediate theatre district and finding a plethora of nearby restaurants and bars, but also within easy walking distance of Central Station, the Rockefeller Centre, Fifth Avenue and other popular attractions. The team here was very friendly and helpful – our sincere thanks go to Lidia in Reservations who kindly arranged our early check-in, as this made such an enormous difference to our first day! Also to Viviana and Monique for their relaxed friendliness and efficiency, and to Dixon, Carlos and Acharaf in the lounge, who always wore welcoming smiles, were proactive, made time to say hello, and were simply charming! Finally, our extra special thanks to Patrick for his outstanding, genuine personal service! When advising us in thorough detail about our intended exploration of Chelsea, Soho and Greenwich on foot, he went far and beyond the normal call of duty, and in our opinion is a great asset to the company!",Christchurch,"KiwiCat06</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Christchurch</strong>",37,4.0

A beautiful property in a wonderful location marred by the worst guest relations I have ever experienced. Upon returning from the theater at midnight we found ourselves locked out (yes, imagine?) of the hotel. No sign or note on the door to tell us how to gain access. There's one entrance and there is no employee visible from the outside street. Mind you, we spent $300 for the night and WE ARE LOCKED OUT. After pounding on the glass window a woman desk clerk came into view and waved to us, indicating that we should go down the street. Huh? Really? She's inside, we're outside, she's NOT LETTING US IN.We went looking in the direction she had pointed to, found a theater next door, tried the door and it was locked. We returned to the hotel window and knocked on the glass again. She once again waved down the street. REALLY?We went two more doors down the street, found that there is a sister hotel with an unmarked corridor that leads to our hotel, and we arrive into the lobby very annoyed. We expressed our utter disbelief that this was a normal procedure for a $300/night hotel. We asked to see a manager. Do you want to venture a guess who the desk clerk called? Two large and threatening security guards. How could this be happening??? While we were standing there asking to see a manager, the goon security guards proceeded to let other returning guests in the door that we had been denied access to. All while the desk clerk maintained that she is NOT ALLOWED TO LET PEOPLE IN THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AT THIS HOUR OF THE EVENING. Wha??????? I told one of the guards that I didn't appreciate his threatening demeanor and he countered with ""do you feel threatened?"" Gee, let me see. Two brawny guys respond to the desk clerk's phone call and there is no attempt to locate a manager. Perhaps I am easily threatened.

While booking, it is presented a a ""sister"" hotel to the Millenium Broadway Hotel with a more upscale concept. I believe it boasts a 4.5 star rating, but I saw mixed reviews on TA but decided to book anyway as they were advertising a 15% room rate discount promo. Pros: -The rooms are spacious and nicely appointed. - Location is excellent just off Times Square- Happy hour between 5-7pm on mezzanine floor with free drinks and snacks. Cons: - Expect NO service. The whole idea of staying at a luxury hotel is not just the room and location, but the staff and service. -Upon check in, I was rushed through, which is fine, but the demeanor of the staff is as if you're at the Tax Office or a busy KFC restaurant. No one helped me with my luggage (solo female traveller). I was given the key and a perfunctory overview of breakfast timings. - Housekeeping was terrible. Many times I had to physically hand my full trash can to the lady who was in charge of my floor to empty them after she had cleaned my room. - No one greets you at the door and reception staff just looks defensive and as you walk by to the elevators heading to your room. - I had requested late check out which I didn't get as the hotel was sold out. Fair enough. But when the hotel car arrived to pick me up and I needed to get my luggage out of storage, Monique at the desk informed me that the bell boy was on break and ""you should have had your claim tickets out sooner!"" I didn't understand this. I am not in kindergarten to be admonished like this. I informed her that I thought this was a luxury hotel and had assumed there would be a bell boy to help me. Anyway, I had to lug my stuff to the curb myself in the pouring rain. I would never stay here again and would recommend the Millenium Broadway next door which has a bustling lobby, doormen, bell boys galore, a smiling staff.

Bathroom was a good size with a separate tub & shower. We also requested a small fridge as we read other reviews prior to booking and this was delivered with no extra charge. One of the reasons we chose this Hotel was that it included a continental breakfast which was very convenient. My only comment here is that they might consider adding hot oatmeal. Access was available to the lounge all day with coffee/tea. Happy hour was also included daily with a great selection of snacks and unlimited wine which was really appreciated after a long day of sightseeing. The room was clean & the staff very helpful.

The staff are very pleasant but since there aren't that many rooms, the amount of staff is minimal at times. At 10:00pm at night the lobby was unmanned which is a little unnerving since you are ½ block from Time Square. We felt safe in the rooms because you can't use the elevator without a room key, but when we walked in one night there were a couple of rough looking characters just walking out of the lobby. Any of the service you might require apparently has to come from the Millennium which is unsatisfactory. We asked for ice for our room (you can't get your own) and had to wait 20-30 minutes, usually with a second call. That was true for any request for service. They have a complementary evening cocktail and morning continental breakfast which is one of the reasons we picked them. It was very nice and manned by pleasant staff, but seating is limited. They had very nice hors d'oeuvres but it seems that once they ran out they were not set up to refill (because food had to come from the Millennium).

I wonder if it worked the other way too...The staff was able to help me with issues, bathroom light didn't work at one point and they fixed it asap. The cleaners were a bit all over the place... One time I had a list in my room with all of the customers names on it. The one water bottle provided per day was awesome, although one day I didn' t get one. The complimentary drinks and snacks were amazing, I went to get them everyday. The space provided for them was a bit uncomfy especially in the mornings, it's a bit hard to eat your breakfast from your lap. Overall I do recommend the hotel for everyone.","Helsinki, Finland","ladyuna123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",6,4.0

So much so our taxi driver hadn't even heard of it!?We booked our Christmas getaway just 72 hours prior to departure and got a great deal. We chose this hotel because of location and value for money. The hotel isn't anything special, but adequate and good size rooms for a central hotel. The room decor is a little bland, but we had a small lounge area, a Queen size bed which was firm, but comfortable and our bathroom had a walk in shower. We stayed in room 2022, which meant we had a great view of the city. the room has a safe, ironing board and iron, hair dryer and coffee machine. Our package included a free breakfast which you can get in the Mezzanine. The options available here were limited cereal choices, pastries, bagels and cold hard boiled eggs as well as tea, coffee and juices. We found the concept of the Mezz quite strange. I believe the hotel would have benefited from a properly equipped room where you could have breakfast. The seating is relaxed, therefore sunken chairs and sofas and small coffee tables which in my opinion is not an ideal environment for eating. The Mezz is also where you have your happy hour. Which includes limited wine and beer selections as well as tea and coffee, soft drinks and canapes. The selection of canapes depends on what day it is and how late you arrive. It was a nice touch that it was all ""free"" but I can't say we were exactly excited with the environment or selection on the couple of times we popped in. The hotel is fit for purpose, and if we want to stay in Times Square again we would reconsider it. Pros - Great location and clean. The bed is turned down every night, and the lady that did this is lovely and we were glad we were able to tip for this quaint service. Cons - One dressing gown, one bottle of water left daily in a double room!? House keeping was sometimes lacking, left a tip every day but sometimes wouldn't replenish the coffee/creamer and toiletries. We had a fridge in our room which was on but wasn't cold. So instead of fixing it, the door to the cabinet door that housed it was nailed shut! This wasn't so much of a problem for us, so we didn't complain.","Hertfordshire, United Kingdom","SoulfulMinx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hertfordshire, United Kingdom</strong>",311,3.0

Monique also helped get us checked in and the whole staff is so friendly, can't say enough about the hospitality, they really make you feel like family. Our room was clean and perfect for our stay, it has a coffee maker and they provide a bottle of water for the room each day as needed. One of the highlights of this hotel was that they have a continental style complimentary breakfast from 7-10 AM and a Happy Hour of sorts that serves beer/wine and appetizers from 5-7 PM. This was awesome! The best part of this hotel was it's location. It is next door to the sister hotel, Millennium Broadway hotel and had a great bar/lounge that served good food and we made friends with the bartender Alec and the staff was all very friendly. There are restaurants all over the area, it is 2 min walk to times square, Good Morning America, all theatres and bars and pubs.

We arrived at the hotel at 1pm. The staff (male, can't remember his name) was very snobbish and not at all welcoming. We were told that we're early and we need to come back at 3pm to check in. The lobby looked very empty and I don't think there was no room for us. Anyway, we decided to go for lunch and requested to leave our luggage with the hotel. Then, this staff carried our bags one-by-one into the storage room. Half way through, he was interrupted by another guest. He attended to this guest, leaving my last piece of baggage in the middle of the lobby! We have walked out of the hotel but I felt uneasy and I had to return (and saw my bag was still in the lobby) and remind him to keep my bag. Finally, we went back at 3pm to get checked in. The same staff who spoke to me earlier said that he is knocking off, and I have to wait for the next staff to take over him. Then, he continued to laze around chatting away with the bellman, leaving us waiting at the counter. It took 10 mins for the next person on duty to come and he took his own sweet time to settle down, and finally we waited for another 20 mins to check in successfully! I mean, how could there be only one person on duty at the check in counter? I have been to many hotels and I must say that this is the first time a reputable hotel like Grand Millennium really let me down. I must be so unlucky to meet one irresponsible and one lazy staff in just a short 30-mins of my arrival at the hotel-- definitely not the first impression you want to give your guest. Our room was not very big, but it was quite decent. There was no street noise. There was complimentary wine in the evening (5pm) and breakfast was included in the room. However, the breakfast was really limited in choice. There were only some rolls, fruits and cereal. The location of the hotel is superb, steps away from Times Square, lots of shops and restaurants around. Personally I feel that there is nothing wrong with the hotel, but there is a big problem with it's staff attitudes. I will not go back to the hotel again.

Separate bath and shower.Hot Water was HotWater pressure was strong.Shower was small but OKDownside was that it was hit and miss for a full towel complement after room was serviced and toiletries replaced.On Friday when we came back around 2:30pm the room was still not cleaned which was OK. There was a phone message stating we needed to change rooms due to the drapes being replaced on Sunday. In going down to the front desk to inquire I was told that there was no need to change rooms. Just for the record the drapes where never replaced while we were there.On Saturday when we got back to the room in mid afternoon there was a strong paint smell. Again I went down and the front desk and they were surprised that we were on the 19th floor. They thought it was cleared. The 18th floor was closed and being remodeled or something and there was painting. The smell had come up into the 19th floor. They were very willing to change our room but the wife did not want to pack and unpack. So we put a towel at the door to block the smell from getting.

There are a number of others that state they are in Times Square but if I was that far away from the main drag I would not be happy. Times Square is not for you if you are shy retiring or want a quiet getaway to soothe the soul. If you want to see all the ny has to offer and want to be in the midst of the madness that is time square this is a very good choice. The price is very reasonable and if you can get it from the site that doesn't give names it's unbeatable. Now the price is very reasonable and for the location way below that which the others charge. Here is the problem. The hotel room size is great for ny but the general trim fit and finish, decor all are not up to par. There is things like wallpaper peeling in areas. On floor 35 by the elevators for example. The night staff are either totally absent or grunt for your room keys. This is something I don't get because we kept our room keys so even though I am no longer checked in I can still get in. It doesn't really offer any security. I guess it must be there to stop the prostitutes sorry escorts getting in but the john can just meet them downstairs so not too sure what purpose it serves especially as the security staff are often totally absent anyway.  The room itself is a little tired but the views even the back streets like we got are great for people watching and general entertainment. Soap and towels are at a premium here which is weird. If you are all action and hardcore like us you will be out all day. We often got back at 10pm even though the plan was for returning at 2ish, ny is like that! Coming in gasping for a shower only to find no towels or soap etc is not great. Overall for value for money it's hard to beat. There is a grocery store opposite the hotel and this place is best avoided as it is so overpriced and the old Asian guy is obviously too rich and older than customer service. Walgreens is nearby just get what you need on the way back to stop this pirate getting away with your loot. Also generally avoid the food places in Times Square as there are some truly shockingly amazing places to eat and these tourist traps do not deserve your money or time. You have come this far go to nice places and they don't have to be expensive.","Toronto, Canada","AlienDrifter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",71,4.0

Our view wasn't all that great because we we're on the backside of the facility but it was fine because we weren't in the room that much anyways. I feel like the room was overpriced because there was no refrigerator, no microwave, no ice machine, and not even a place to get something to drink inside the hotel; no vending machines.

I didn't so let me share my experience:(1) F&B - a glass vase of fresh orange juice at the breakfast lounge actually broke into 2 pieces (top and bottom) when I tried to pick it up from the buffet spread. The server apologized immediately and left me waiting in my wet apparel for his manager to handle the incident. The F&B manager Anna came after a good wet wait and also applogized not knowing otherwise how to handle it. I had to suggest that they send my apparels for laundry as I'm traveling (who isn't if they are not staying in the hotel?!). Like the server she showed great service and agreed to do it. However when my husband handed the wet apparels to her shortly after she said she is not handling this ""department"" so she can't promise to get the express laundry (which is offered by the hotel) done. She promised to get back to us which she didn't when she left for the day and even before we checked out the next day.(2) Front desk - we checked with the front desk at least twice throughout the day for the status of the laundry request.Each front desk person said with great confidence and assurance that they will look for the laundry which by the time (less than half a day since we have handed it over to Anna) was considered missing and promised to hand over to the next front desk person properly after their shift ends. It was such great assurance that we didn't quite jot down their names. They were Rominia and Hector and another Hispanic origin night shift lady who didn't wear her name badge. So anyway each time we had to repeat our story because none of the front desk person followed through with their promise neither did they handed anything over to the next person. And the last one actually said it was probably because we had a do not disturb sign on my door that's why as if there aren't any other way to reach us (like when they could slip our bill beneath the door on the day we checked out). The last front desk person promised with great confidence and assurance that she couldn't said for her colleagues that she meant what she said and will inform her manager to find other ways to compensate us for all the trouble we experienced. Not surprisingly another lip service officer in The Premier. (3) housekeeping - who confidently told front desk and us that there was no such article for our room. We had to sit at the front desk and personally insist that they locate it there and then (at midnight cos we were leaving first thing the next day). The housekeeping had to summon 2 extra pairs of hands from the concierge to help find the laundry at housekeeping which they eventually did. The laundry was done. A proper laundry slip with our name and room number was also properly detailed on it so how is it they said there wasn't anything for us all day and had to use extra pair of hands to look for a properly tagged laundry?? And you would think you would be safe not putting anyone to the laundry? Try checking the water container of coffee making machine. Not sure if they ever washed it. They have powdery substances in it. Bath tubs are dry probably due to dry air and have things dried on top of it. Overall you might find this hotel has great location and really great customer service (on the surface) but when you are traveling you really want to be sure the hotel can do more than a bed at the centre of a busy place and lip service hotel staffs.

I was apprehensive about staying in Times Square and was worried that we would not get any peace & quiet and because of the price (which was about $450 a night this week, but dropped to 1/2 of that on our last night) but my friend who I was traveling with won out and I do not regret our decision! First of all, the staff is wonderful and they were very helpful, from the moment we checked in, to their quick action of moving us to another room, when the toilet seal started leaking. We felt very safe and secure because you had to have a key to work the elevator. The added bonus of the room and nightly cocktail hour were great! The breakfast was a simple breakfast of fresh bread, bagels, pastries, cream cheese, ham and cheeses along with juice and coffee. It was a great way to quickly start our day and saved us from having to spend $20 a morning on breakfast in the city. The nightly cocktail hour, consisted of wine, beer and appetizers. It was a nice way to sit down and relax for a little bit before going back out into the city for the evening and before grabbing dinner. The staff in the lounge were very attentive to our needs and were very friendly. The rooms on this side are very spacious as far as hotel rooms in the city go, they do only have 1 queen bed or 1 king bed but that works fine for friends traveling together or for couples without kids. This side of the hotel was very quiet, could not hear the commotion from Times Square but our room also did not have a city view, we had a view of another building, but that was fine with us because the only times we were in the room was to relax or sleep. If there are just 2 people in your room I would definitely suggest staying here, you will not regret it.

It was for our 25th wedding anniversary and our 1st time to New York - very big trip! So, one of the things you're paying for and you have set in your mind as you've had this important room booked for so long is this beautiful view - that's why they have floor to ceiling windows - right? So we get their early and I'm prepared to ask if we can just check our luggage till rooms open up but the ""girl"" snobbishly says ""oh, I do have a room open for you. I told her that we can wait and explain the above info.... blah blah blah I want to make sure its a nice room and she tells me that it is a wonderful room - ends up on the 8th floor, rotten view, wait did I say ""view""? Not. We wait till later in the day when things open up and are told that we can't switch as they are filled for the week. I've really been treated better at a Holiday Inn and overall the room was not fantastic as pictured, its a pretty average room and in hind site I wish I would have gone with a smaller place and paid a lot less since I wasn't ever going to get a view that I'd hoped for and I'd had better service too.

Perhaps that's why the train wreck we experienced this weekend was such a surprise. This was clearly a case of poor management and poor customer service. I spend over 100 nights a year in hotels and I can honestly say that this was the worse customer service experience I've had this year Round 1 First we had booked three rooms for a family weekend of theatre in the city. My partner arrived before I did and tried to check in. Instead of politely telling him he had to wait till four or explaining as the reservation for all rooms was in my name so they needed proof he was authorized to check in the front desk clerk was rude and hostile questioning if my partner was at the right hotel. Then he quizzed my partner over which room he was sleeping in and despite my calling the hotel and explaining the situation I had to have the reservation changed by the booking agent. My partner asked to speak to the manager and first he was told that the manager didn't work on weekends and when he insisted the guy told him that ""there was no point as the manager would tell him the same thing"". When after my partner insisted that he he speak to the manager the front desk manager came out and was actually quite competent and explained that as the room wouldn't be ready till four it was a moot point and suggested that my partner have lunch then come back. In the meantime I called the booking agent and asked them to alter the reservation which they did. When we then attempted to recheck in the new desk clerk insisted there was now only one reservation. Only after insisting he look by confirmation numbers did he find it. Then he gave me a lecture on how this was a result of adding my partners name ...huh. ..I added my partners name because they asked me to. Overall, rude hostile and misinformed. Round 2Getting home late to the room we noticed the AC suddenly shut off and the room was filled with smell of smoke. I immediately called the operator and said we smell smoke. She told us she would send security. 10 minutes later and more smoke we called again. The operator seemed surprised security hadn't arrived. I said it was urgent and also we needed to switch rooms. She connected me to front desk and this snide and offensive woman answered. I told her the situation and she said there were No more rooms and there wasn't anything she could do. I insisted that since it was her hotel room that smelled like smoke she needed to deal with it she said ""I can't do anything till I talked to my manager "" huh...a guest has a smoke filled room but she has to talk to a manager. Finally the security guy arrived and to be honest he was great. He acknowledged that there was definitely smoke in the room, he called engineering and told me of course we needed to move rooms. The engineers came in and decided to pull the room from inventory. The phone rang and it was the front desk clerk who told me a room had been found and we could come down and get a key. Okay. Maybe it's me but since this is the premier tower and it's their equipment pouring smoke in the room at midnight maybe they should have offered to bring the key to us and send a bellman to help us move rooms...that would be good service and the front desk staff here seems immune to it. When we did go down to get the new keys she was brusque and rude and not once said "" I'm sorry your having to move rooms at midnight"" or I'm sorry this has been a problem "" the phrase I'm sorry or how can I help is not in her vocabulary. All I can think is people like these get what they deserve...unemployment as their business dwindles..perhaps she can get a job at the DMV but that would require better customer service skills. I'll never be back to that millennium or any in the future. Of course one of the great things about NYC is that their are hundreds of great hotels...this just isn't one of them.

Clean (I am a stickler for clean!) and on private floors with only 5 rooms per floor. Any noise heard was from the street and that is to be expected in NYC.

I have to agree with one of the reviewers though about breakfast. Although it is not wise to compare The Premier's breakfast to European standards, I thought it was not what I expected from a luxury hotel. My husband even commented that the Happy Hour food is so much better than their breakfast food. We stayed for two nights and three days, and on the first night, my impression of the Happy Hour attendant is that he is not friendly, too stiff for someone who is in the hotel business. The second night though, the attendant was very attentive, professional and anticipated guests' needs. I understand that the set-up of the mezzanine interior is informal and casual which is ideal for the ""Happy Hour"" crowd, although not so ideal for breakfast.

Had a few niggles before we arrived (on line requests ignored etc) but as soon as Monique got involved, all was sorted! We are loyal Millennium travellers - always choosing the brand when visiting Boston and we stayed in the Millennium UN Plaza and Millennium Broadway in previous NYC visits. We were excited at the prospect of staying in the Premier this time.Ok - first the good points. It is small - only 7 rooms on each floor so it really does have a boutique feel. The rooms - certainly our room - was larger than the NYC average with a comfy bed and decent bathroom - bath and separate shower. Monique was simply fantastic and , mindful that we were delayed by 3 hrs, had arranged for extra water and towels in our room. She had also organised welcome gifts to mark our anniversary - frsh roses, champagne on ice and a nice selection of chocolates. Well done Monique - these touches guarantee return visits.Hving access to the premier lounge for free continental breakfast and evening wine receptions was a nice touch - though the lounge oftens stuggled to cope with the number of guests.On the negative side, a premier hotel should pay a little more attention to detail - so the toiletries could be much better, the towels should be replaced, wallpaper should not be peeling off the walls and shower tidies should not be hanging off the wall. all areas of the rooms and bathrooms should be dusted and if the guest information says that ice is available on each floor, then it should be - in reality it's not available on any floor and you ring for ice. Not a big issue, but symptomatic of a lack of attention to detail.The location is perfect for midtown - seconds form Times Square but in a quiet street. We were unwell during our stay so did not get to venture too far. Local restaurants that we enjoyed included Losteria, the Long Room and Virgils - all just opposite the hotel entrance. Had a fab steak dinner at Smith & Wollensky.So, in summary, a decent, rather than Premier hotel. Monique is so good that I forgive some of the minor irritants. More attention to detail needed if this place is to retain its premier status - we would return for sure but get the feeling it's due a refurb any time soon - and with the right refurb, this could be a winner in the millennium portfolio.",Northern Ireland,"JoMark</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northern Ireland</strong>",38,4.0

A couple of reasons stopped me from giving a 5 - the lack of view, my room was at the back of the hotel and looked out over the back of other buildings. The plus side of that should have been quietness, however, there was a persistent droning noise from what sounded like a very large air conditioning exhaust unit which, of course, becomes more pronounced during the night. My room (420) was located right next to the elevators and I could hear them going up and down through the bathroom wall and the door wasn't soundproof enough to stop the sound of the chimes of arrival and departure. We tried the complimentary breakfast on the first morning only, but sometimes being free isn't reason enough to partake and this was one of those times. For the price of the rooms and being 'premier' you still have a level of expectation which wasn't fulfilled at all. The room is quite small and on our visit, very busy. With no staff in attendance huge pressure was being applied to everything, seating, food, dishes etc. Dirty dishes were either left on tables or overflowing in the 'kitchen' area of the room. Clean cutlery had run out, my colleague had to wash a knife to use, the bagels ran out and the tea was cold. Maybe some can relax and ignore things like people standing with food in their hands waiting for a seat to become vacant, clutter and unclean dishes but we can't and so didn't bother going again. Based on that experience, we didn't even try the happy hour. From the disappointments to the positives, because 4 stars is still a good rating. Times Square location is superb, the reception team are very friendly, helpful and fun, the rooms are indeed pristine, a good size (not large) with good amenities, separate bath & shower and my favourite (because all hotels should offer this as standard) is a pretty quick free WIFI service. I would stay again depending on comparative room rate. Such a premier location demands a high rate, but in our experience, they do vary by hotel.","Auckland, New Zealand","MaccyGz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",17,4.0

They went above the call of duty and by the time we left I felt like we had made new friends.

Happy Hour from 5p-7p seemed popular-basic beers and different wines with light samplings.Our King platform bed was very comfy with a white down comforter and extra pillows. The Premier Tower has only 7 rooms on each floor thus given the feeling of being secluded and quiet. We were on the 17th floor with a wonderful view and absolutely no noise. I would definitely stay here again and hoping to return in October. Lastly, what makes a great trip has alot to do with the people one encounters along the way and I can say that without hesitation when it comes to the staff at the Premier who made us feel like we were in their home away from home.

I stayed in a queen bed room in the Premier tower (adjacent to the Millennium, but separate). The room itself was very small (200 sf at most), but had a small sofa, desk, and flat screen TV, as well as a small ""bar"" area for the coffee maker and minibar. The bathroom was a decent size, with separate shower and large tub. The room was clean and modern (it did not have peeling paint or stains that others have described). The bed was comfortable. The windows (which actually open) were floor to ceiling and wrapped around the entire room, with a great view of Times Square.The Premier tower room includes free breakfast and evening snacks (cash bar) on the Mezzanine. Breakfast is the basic continental, including oatmeal, bagels, pastries, fresh fruit, very good coffee. The evening menu varied; one night was sushi/Japanese, one was antipasto, one was Mediterranean; all three were good.For the price, you can't beat the location. It is a block from Times Square, a couple of blocks to the Theatres, and steps away from some of the best restaurants in NYC (The Lambs Club, O'Lunney's, Virgil's BBQ).The fitness room is located in the Millennium tower. It's small, but has almost everything you need for a good workout: free weights, machines, ellipticals, bikes, treadmills, and a stairclimber. No mats or exercise balls.Room service from the restaurant Charlotte (had a dinner and a breakfast) was excellent and timely.The only negative I have is that the second day there was no maid service (even though I left the sign on the door while I was gone -- all afternoon-- that indicates ""please make up the room""). I had even left a $10 tip that was untouched when I got back. However, I did call housekeeping for fresh towels and coffee for the morning, and they were delivered.All in all, for the location, I felt that this was a very good value for my money.

We booked through agoda.com and got what we felt was a brilliant deal at $248 a night including tax. A quick side note though, the booking process was a little confusing as we did not realise this hotel was essentially a seperate hotel to the millenium broadway (seperate check in desk and enterance etc). On our confirmation from agoda it stated we were in the millenium broadway hotel but a premier room so before we arrived we were a little confused as to which hotel we were actually staying in! On arrival we entered the millenium broadway and checked in with a friendly staff member who confirmed our rooms were actually in the premier hotel (next door).Our room was on the 15th floor (room 1521) and I would highly recommend this room! It was a lot bigger than we expected and had a lovely modern bathroom with seperate walk in shower and tub. It also had a lovely view of some of the lights of times square and the new years ball. The bed was a king size and very comfortable as was the seperate lounge sofa. There was also a decent size tv in the room as well as hot drink making facilities, an ironing board and a mini bar. Despite being so close to Times Square the room was really quiet and we hardly heard any noise from the street below. My parents had room 1621 and were very happy with their room as well although it did seem slightly smaller and the bed was facing the other direction which meant they couldnt see times square when sitting in bed like we could. Both rooms were lovely though. The room included breakfast in a morning which was good and included bagels, pastries, cereal, juice and hot drinks. Ther was also an evening reception from 5 until 7 which included complimentary beers (budweiser, coors etc) and wine or soft drinks as well as snacks such as cheese and buscuits. We found that this was a really nice touch and a lovely way to relax before going out for dinner. We also had a paper delivered to our door each morning which was nice. There were only two things that we felt could have improved our stay. One of these was that one of the elevators was broken for the duration of our stay and there was only one working for the whole hotel. The other was that on the Saturday after leaving the theatre we wanted to get a quick drink before bed and intended to visit the bar in the lobby of the millenium broadway. It was around 10.50pm and despite a sign near the door saying it shut at 11 we were told by the waiter/barman that it was closing and he couldnt serve us. This was annoying because firstly because it wasnt yet 11pm and secondly why would a hotel that is in Times Square close its bar at 11pm on a Saturday night?! All was not lost though as there were many other bars in the area and we went and purchased drinks elsewhere.Overall we were over the moon with this hotel. The location is perfect for tourists who are visiting the main shopping areas and sights. The reception staff were always friendly and helpful as was the barman on the mezzanine level.

We were supposed to have a beautiful view but the only thing we saw was a huge building just in front of our window, so no natural light at all. The breakfast was a disaster, if you do not eat pork you will probably not be able to eat anything else then eggs and cereal. The room was just as any other three star hotel room, nothing special.

I selected the Millennium Broadway Hotel for its location. I also stayed at this hotel two years ago for a family vacation. I expected to be at the main hotel, but was directed to the Premier side which was unexpected. The Premier lobby was very nice. I also liked sitting down to check in instead of standing at a high counter. The Premier concierge was a little snarky - like I should be thrilled to have been redirected. The Premier is for the business traveler. Perks of the Premier are coffee makers, free breakfast and happy hour and free internet. Nice!My original room was next to the elevator even though I requested via phone that morning to be in a quiet location away from the elevator. When I returned to the lobby and asked to be moved, the concierge said she had stayed in that room and it was very quiet. I could hear the elevator bell inside the room - not quiet and I'm the customer here.The second room looked great, until the bathroom. The whole bathroom could use some attention. The wall paper is peeling, the ventilation didn't work. The glass counter had gunk under it that was visible since it was glass. The shower was awful - moldy and small. I travel with Clorox cleaning clothes, so cleaned it myself.

The bellman brought ice, but no guide. He said he would be back with one. About 10 minutes late I got a call telling me to look on channel 78 for the TV guide. Shesh. The sheets were not very good (felt rough, like a poly/cotton blend with fuzz balls). I love Hilton sheets/duvets; those are my ideal hotel bed sets.The room was very quiet. The internet was fast and free. The room was sleek and modern with a couch on one side and the bed on the other. The large flat screen TV was on a table that swiveled to face either one.The happy hour was fine. The wine was decent, but the appetizers were not my style.I'm glad I cleaned the shower because it didn't drain well. I was standing in water by the end and the shower curtain was a ""hugger"".I could hear dripping in the wall at different times during my stay. Once was 6:30am - it was really noticeable because the room was so quiet. It sounded like something above me was leaking (maybe a shower?). I stopped in the main hotel lounge one evening for a drink. Excellent service and really friendly!Would I stay again? Maybe if the price was right because the location is fabulous.

The furnishings were modern, sturdy and the room sparkling clean. There was a nice sized closet with ironing board and iron and unlike many hotels I have used in New York-- this one had a nice large private bathroom--no sharing!There was no noise at all, even from the street below. The lounge was wonderful for the cocktail hour and for the nice breakfast in the morning. Some people are not concerned about breakfast but I will admit that it was nice to just get up and not have to worry about searching for a place close by. I just hopped into the elevator and got out at the lounge and there it was, brekkie:)What I was most impressed by, other than the excellent service by Monique, was that the elevators were secure. Each guest had to use his/her room card to get the elevators to work so this extra layer of security felt great in a large city.Location is excellent. Though steps away from Times Square, it is just off the main street so traffic noise is not an issue.There really was nothing wrong with this place and the only complaint I could conjure up, and this is minor, is that the room did not have wireless.

The room was huge, not just huge for NYC, seriously huge. We had a great view of 44th street and even the flashing lights of Broadway. The room was clean, carpet was worn a bit-but who's complaining. We found the location to be perfect, just steps from the heart of Times Square and easy access to the subway. We had a 7 year old in tow and she had no troubles keeping pace. We felt safe and had no issues at all with the hotel. The elevator will not move without a room key-nice feature for women traveling alone. My daughter loved making tea for us at night-great perk after a long day on our feet. We got a great rate (for NYC) right off the website and we loved the couch in the room as it made a nice bed for the little one. Every request to housekeeping was met in minutes...We will definitely stay here again!

The room was big, by NYC standards and included some nice amenities (flat screen tv, coffee pot in room and a decent size bathroom). However, the lighting set up was weird-you could not have one bedside lamp on by itself. The other REALLY annoying thing about the hotel was the towels. They didn't seem to dry very well and, worse than that, they left huge amounts of lint on hands.body, hair.

Large bathroom with bath and shower, nice amenities. breakfast was included in the price and was a self service buffet. Not amazing food but sufficient choice and always filled. Staff was very pleasant and welcoming.I was a little bit surprise by the lobby which was rather small and unpersonnal, probably explained by the fact that Premier is an annexe of the millenium hotel broadway next door. I didn't expected anything special but it looked more like some kind of office building hall than a luxury hotel to me. All in all, i found hotel common parts lacking of personnality, and overall aspect could probably be improved to look more luxurious than it is, but it's not really what matters to me.Again room was good and there were no false note of any kind during my stay....Except one thing, though it is not the responsability of the hotel.Beware of the Driver limo in front of the hotel. They do business in the back of the hotel with the help of a doorman, offering ride rates cheaper than the hotel rates (to go to the airport) but try to crook you at the end pretending highway taxes where not include in the price, though it was very clearly stated they were included by the doorman who offered the rate ....","Paris, France","tony888</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Paris, France</strong>",18,4.0

That said, Millennium's Premier almost makes it worth running the gauntlet. Rooms are modern, serene, comfortable, and thoughtfully laid out. The bathroom is roomy and luxurious, scarcities in NYC. The staff is courteous, personable and adept, and checkin/checkout are a breeze. I never take advantage of hotel lounges or continental breakfasts, so I couldn't comment on those except to say it's nice to have them available. A bonus, because you're in an area not noted for its dining choices, is that Virgil's Barbecue is right across the street, Cafe 123 (an unexceptional but quite passable French bistro that's been a reasonably-priced mainstay for many years) a few doors down, and a fully-stocked deli/convenience store a bit further down the block. Cabs are surprisingly plentiful on 7th Avenue or Broadway (Times Square), because most tourist gawkers never leave the vicinity.I've stayed in most all of New York's big hotels and can say without qualification that the Premier is one of the nicest hotels in the city. And if it were over on 9th Avenue, or below 30th Street, or just about anywhere save Times Square, I'd probably stay there on every trip.",somewhere on a lumpy mattress,"homesick_and_grumpy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>somewhere on a lumpy mattress</strong>",78,5.0

I should have left then. If the housekeeping staff could overlook such obvious filth, what else in the room might have been overlooked and never properly cleaned?The room was cramped and unwelcoming. The carpeting and the room in general were dirty and unkempt. The uncomfortable sofa was a worn sectional in two pieces with wooden arms. There was no lap blanket. The magazines were piled carelessly on the table. There wasn’t even a pen in the room. A Zen garden with a broken rake rested on the desk.The ironing board was not properly attached to the door, so it banged loudly every time I opened the closet. There were no bathrobes and only three very small bath towels for two adults. The paint on the exposed ceiling pipe was peeling off.I cannot stress enough the disturbing effect of the hotel’s disappointing and dirty facilities had on me. We didn't book two rooms at a luxury hotel for nearly $900 a night to have such a shabby, careless and poorly maintained accommodation. On Sunday morning we never received an in room checkout or a hotel evaluation card, making me wonder if the staff suspected we would comment negatively about our stay. Prior to check out we called the desk for our car. We were told we had to go to the Millennium Hotel Bell Stand for information about it. We had to drag our luggage through thePremier to the Millennium lobby to the 45th Street entrance. The bellhop did not know how we would be able to get out of 6th Avenue. The parking attendant handed us our car keys and parking stub, left us facing a crowd of people and a wooden barricade, and told us to ask the police to let us drive through it. Only after we approached some NYC police officers did we get help. We had to turn our SUV around and the police officers guided us the wrong way down a one-way street. Finally we were on our way.When I am on a vacation I do not like to confront service personnel. I choose hotels and resorts with the highest ratings for service and accommodations. I do not want to voice complaints, have confrontations, or draw attention to myself. I try to choose recreation that is stress free. And mostly I do not want to be concerned about the sanitary conditions of my bed or bathroom.I looked at your web site before I booked. I expected a relaxing stay at a luxury hotel. Your advertisement clearly misrepresents the quality, service, facilities and attitude of the Premier.Your customer service director is quoted in one press release as saying she wants consistently satisfied customers and that the Premier guarantees it will ""meet and exceed the expectations of our guests."" The Premier facilities are far from hitting that mark.My stay at the Premier last night was most unpleasant. I keep recalling the sooty writing on the wall and am unnerved by the unseen filth it may represent. I feel I have been grossly cheated, not only because of the high price I paid for a very bad experience but also because my weekend was so hurt by this situation. I can see no reason to stay at your hotel again and I will certainly share my experience with as many people as I can.I hope you will address my complaints and respond.
