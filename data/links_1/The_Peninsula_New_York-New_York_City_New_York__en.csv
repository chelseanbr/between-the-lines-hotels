Figures, both political & cultural, played out some of their lives at such hotels, with some there when world-altering events occurred. Rudy Giuliani was to hear about the events of 9/11 while at The Peninsula a good few of us are still familiar with lines of soccer star superstar, George Best, delivered while living at The Savoy.I have visited both a good few times & was lucky enough to be treated to a weekend end at The lPeninsula, when traveling through NYC on a trip from Oxford to Vancouver both ways in September 2002, a year .of commemoration after 9/11. Everything about The Peninsula ie truly wonderful.The location on 5th Ave at 55th signals its singularity.Right in the center of midtown NYC, it is in a prime position for important venues like The Roosevelt Centre & it is also well located for fine dining & good shopping. The bar & lounge is terrific with good service & food & drinks, as is the roof top bar & patio dining .  In fact , there was great service right across the hotel & both my nights at 5/55 were just wonderful. With all which was wonder that weekend, swimming in its roof top pool looking over 5th Ave & 55th street, topped it allI love swimming & have swam almost anywhere at a drop of a hat. Swimming high above NYC in the Peninsula’s pool is one of my favorite swimming experiences in my swimming life, which has stretched out over some 50 years, five continents & 58 counties. It is up there in my in my top five pools around the world.The Peninsula also has a very enlightened “pet” policy, allowing pets to stay with their owners,Our Buddhist dog, Riley P Fuller, was an enthusiastic traveller & bon vivant. The Peninsula was just Riley’s kind off place, as is NYC.In fact, a stay at The Peninsula was on his bucket list.If he were here now, he would’ eagerly be awaiting The Peninsula’s reopening.Posted by S Fuller","Vancouver, Canada","690sf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",19,5.0

Often you pay a premium price for a mediocre experience. Here you pay a premium price and feel that the promise was delivered. The staff is incomparable.

We visited on multiple occasions and always felt that we entered the real New York. The one where the staff doesn't care and you are on your own in the concrete jungle - but still paying a premium price.Having shared the negative, I want to end by saying we loved our stay at The Peninsula and will be back whenever in NYC.","palm beach, fl","rslcb</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>palm beach, fl</strong>",32,5.0

As we arrived the hotel decorations on the exterior included the trademark Bellman in white. We were greeted by doormen and bellmen that gave us a welcome and took care of the luggage. The interior was also tastefully decorated . Our next stop was reception where we were welcomed by Shuma. She checked us in and then escorted us to our room. The room overlooked 5th Avenue and was nicely appointed. As one would expect linen and toweling was first class, even the hotel slippers where fluffy and comfortable. The amenities in the bathroom were Oscar de La Renta. The bath had both tub and shower and was ample size. Did I mention the view '0). It snowed a bit so we could see the flakes as it hit 5th. The midtown location is very convenient. As we were leaving we met Byron in the elevator and we struck up a friendly conversation and expected no more but he too extended the extra effort. Without being asked he took our luggage to the hotel entrance and secured a car for us.

We had stayed many times years ago and were excited to celebrate our 30th Anniversary there. A week before arriving I read a series of reviews in TripAdvisor that the hotel had fallen on disrepair and had become “tired and beat”...Worried about these reviews I emailed the hotel in advance of arriving and explained my concerns. I was promised I had nothing to worry about and that they were aware of these reviews and concerns and assured me we would receive a fresh wonderfully appointed room consistent with what was a five star hotel(please note the nightly rates are that of a five start hotel). Upon checking in our room was not ready(not a big deal) however when we returned 2 hours later and went to our room we were mortified; the room was beat, the carpet was stained, the furniture was beat up, scratched and dirty and more interesting the night stand had a hole in it. The television was so old when my wife called and asked in there was a guide in the TV, she was told it was in the table as a note card. Further, despite being told our luggage was in our room when we returned to the hotel... it turns out the luggage was misplaced and took 40 minutes to find its way to our room. This became important as we were leaving the hotel to move to a different hotel(that didn’t lie to us about the condition of the hotel)..so we ultimately sat in the room for almost an hour waiting for our lost luggage so we could in fact leave and find a new hotel. In as much as it was now 5:00pm and we had theatre tickets for 7:00pm it made for a stressful terrible first day of our anniversary trip.The a Pennisula was at one time one of the greats in NYC. The hotel is now like a 30 year old Rolls Royce; it looks beautiful and elegant from the outside but once inside you realize the interior is badly worn out and the engine no longer works....",,Alexander B,1,1.0

I woke up after the first night with back and neck aches, which is rare for me. Aside from that, the room was really loud—we kept waking up all night from the people walking above us and outside the room. Since a good night's sleep is the number one thing I want from a hotel, The Peninsula was a disappointment, especially for the price.A few smaller things: we had lunch at the restaurant. The food was okay, but it was really expensive for what it was, and we were asked if we wanted wine throughout our meal three different times by three different waiters. It felt like they kept trying to up-sell us. And finally, when we were checking out, my husband was hauling our suitcases down the stairs and received no help, even though there were employees watching.","Seattle, Washington","WhereSheWanders</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",9,2.0

The hotel is very classic and has all the features for a luxury property. The spa is a must visit as the treatment options are outstanding. The amenities within it are small but it’s not crowded so it was fine. There’s a rooftop bar that was extremely lively at night with a ridiculous view of Central Park and the city. I especially loved how central this property is to all the shopping you can wish for. It’s right across the street from Tiffanys where we had breakfast!!

For both the junior suite and executive suite, the sofa bed was needed to be opened for the period of my stay. Every morning they closed it except for two days. Every time I asked for something, for example, one time I asked for two bottles of water, two bottles of shower gel, the housekeeping would give me 6 bottles of water and 4 bottles of shampoo. It would also take them 20 mins to get the items. The housekeeping also left a stack of pillowcases in the suite one morning I don’t know for what purposes. The bathroom floor was not cleaned properly as it was brown when I wiped it when I first arrived my suite. For the superior room, the staff didn’t change one of the tissue rolls and simply just left the rod in the bathroom. The staff is supposed to refill the things that were used/exhausted but none of times were done precisely and thoroughly. The poor service has me wondering where the hotel got its 5 star from. I get it they want tips and all that but even so, shouldn’t they act more diligently and professionally? This is not what I expect from a 5-star hotel, more like 3-star quality.

The location at 55th and 5th puts you right in the center of so many of the best parts of the city. The shopping and food in the area are fantastic. Although the street is under repair and traffic is generally chaotic around there, valet parking was a surprisingly smooth experience. Staff from the doormen to the bell boys to housekeeping to the front desk and concierge were professional and friendly. Our room was great with an exceptionally large bathroom. Don't expect great views from the room as most of the rooms are down too low. But we enjoyed the view of the surrounding buildings just fine. The indoor pool is special (you can dine at the pool), as are the sundeck and fitness center. They even have a lovely herb garden in the sundeck area. The only downsides were breakfast at the 2nd floor restaurant Clement and the lack of creative cocktails at the Gotham Lounge. For breakfast, perhaps because I had kids with me, we were seated at the worst possible table despite many beautiful window tables, booths, and banquettes being open. This happens often so while I was not surprised, I was disappointed. My child is picky so we asked to just order something from one of the sets a la carte. The server was very resistant and said that was only available as part of a set. I was surprised because this is The Peninsula so I expected him to just say ""of course, no problem"". After I explained that my child is picky and that's the only thing he was willing to eat, he agreed. The food was very slow to come out, and when it did, they had forgotten some of the items. We had a lovely dinner at the Gotham Lounge--the food was great and the service friendly--but I was surprised that they do not have a cocktail list or really any signature cocktails. They had a handful of champagne cocktails they were offering, but when I told the server I don't like champagne, they said to just tell them what I wanted and they could make it. As I explained, I love trying the signature cocktails of different properties because if you ask me what I want, I'll just say something usual like a Dark & Stormy. They ended-up making me a mojito which was just ok. I strong suggest they come up with a few creative, non-champagne cocktails as this could really be an attraction to the lounge, which is a beautiful space. We were also disappointed by the Salon de Ning, as we had hoped to sit outside in the beautiful outdoor lounge space, but for whatever reason it was closed when we went at 7 p.m. and only the bar was open, which was absolutely packed with a very raucous crowd. Despite these few negative points, we loved this hotel and would stay again.",,momtraveler88,2,4.0

But this time, as we like to experience different hotels and also as we were coming with the children (and we have seen before in other Peninsula hotels that they do well with children), we decided to opt for the Peninsula. Key positives include: a great location on the 5th, the rooftop bar (with view), very pleasant and large swimming pool (and spa/gym), warm & friendly staff and delicate attention for the kids (birthday cake and decoration for my son's birthday, welcome gifts, ""petting zoo"" activity in the lobby for Easter...)... One unfortunate glitch (the children's bed was not prepared one evening when coming back from dinner - and the children were tired) and a few things to be aware of: the lobby is slightly crammed/dark (I guess not much that can be done here as this is the historic layout), our room was quite small (and with an uninteresting view over an internal courtyard) and we were not impressed by the breakfast (relatively slow service, quite expensive and not necessarily as good as comparable hotels).

Drawer hinges came right off when we were looking for cups while extension wires with open sockets were velcro-ed across the bed side table making it rather odd and and not to mention, unattractive. The Concierge isn't the warmest given I've met some really amazing ones at the other smaller establishments up in Brooklyn. My new room key was left at the concierge and after a late night out, I approached the reception asking for my room keycard to which I was told I needed to show my ID.

I do have my ID with me at the moment!"" to which the staff at the desk replied with a straight face of "" NO, YOU, are in luck cause I can't give you your room keycard without an ID"" Quite frankly, I find that retort rather unnecessary.

Both are very fine, five-star properties. I expected an experience similar to that in Beverly Hills when I decided to try the Peninsula in NYC. Such was my faith in the Peninsula brand that I ignored the negative reviews and decided to give the hotel a try myself. Oops!My general assessment is that the hotel just needs to be closed for a bottom up (top down?) remodel. When you walk into the lobby the place looks nice enough but it quickly becomes clear that various parts of the lobby have been ""spruced up"" at different times resulting in a lack of cohesion that doesn't feel luxurious. The lobby area by the check in counter has all sorts of things on the wall making it look cluttered and more like a 3 or 4 star hotel. The lobby bathrooms that serve the restaurant, lounge, and two downstairs bars are atrocious. They have rusted hardware, toilet bowls that are scratched and stained, and tiles that at a minimum need polishing (see photos). Worse yet, they are the bathrooms of choice of every cabby that stops at the hotel. The mens room is always filthy.All the elevators are slow. Very slow. There is a bank of six, very dated elevators serving the 20 odd floors of hotel rooms. When I was there it seemed to me that at least one of them was down. Also, I don't think the hotel has a service elevator as you'd have to share the elevator occasionally with the bellmen. That was a very tight squeeze -- the elevator car would get crowded with just five people. It could take a while to get up to the room (or down). The elevators stop on multiple floors, which makes me think there's no priority management of the calls.The rooftop bar at the hotel was, by the looks of it, bolted on in the 1980's. The Peninsula NYC is a historic hotel (formerly the Gotham?), so adding this boxy, brown-glassed contraption to the roof is a crime against good taste. The addition doesn't attempt to blend tastefully with the building, so stylistically it's abominable. Then, there's the layout. You take a separate elevator to get there (just one, and it's slow). The elevator car has a nice addition of a Bose stereo speaker that was probably installed by a handyman. The speaker is bolted onto a crevice separation at the roof of the car for a very homemade look. The elevator itself isn't easy to find, as it's around the corner below the lobby. Perhaps this is the missing service elevator, repurposed for rooftop access? Once up at the roof, there's a snaking corridor with a number of turns in it. It must be terrible navigating this when drunk. Regardless, when you ""arrive"" at the top of a roof deck bar in a five-star hotel, shouldn't the architect be thinking about wow factor? By contrast, the hallway from the elevator to the bar feels claustrophobic. It's cluttered with some weird asian furniture likely bought on sale at Pier One Imports. The walls are painted and adorned with some little art pieces. It again doesn't tie into anything that's in the lobby below and it's dirty. When you walk into the main bar the furniture is clubby, so again, we are introduced to a new style. On the positive side, any view that doesn't have the bar in it is great. The room itself (king room) was ok. I would say it was smaller than expected, but nicely appointed. Good technology, ie light, temp controls and USB ports. The mattress was awful.Also, for the most part the service was excellent and the only reason this review gets a full three stars.In sum, don't stay here unless you're getting the deal of deals -- or if paying full freight, wait until after a major remodel.","Newport Beach, California","instajovsky</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newport Beach, California</strong>",1,3.0

Part of what makes a great NYC hotel is whether or not one can escape the stress of the city after walking through the door. The Peninsula is a beautiful hotel and though I think it would be a mistake to compare it to a truly great hotel like the St. Regis across the street, The Peninsula makes the comparison herself in her literature and even the coffee table book in the suites. Unfortunately, for all of the grandeur of this grand hotel she simply does not live up to her potential - or her promise - of unparalleled luxury and service.It is not lost on me that it must be stressful to be a hotel worker (or anybody in the service industry) this time of year. From the insane requests (like the woman who wanted an adjoining room that was already occupied emptied so she could rent it for an afternoon to open gifts with her family on Christmas Eve) to people being simply unreasonable when it came to the room they were given (a man who bought his room on a travel website, but didn’t want to pay for an upgrade to a better view) - it is obviously difficult to work at a hotel this time of year.There are things, though, that can never be allowed to suffer simply because the hotel is nearly full, the holidays are busy, and the patrons are making unreasonable demands. I would never ‘grade’ a hotel stay based on anything other than the service I receive and the product offered. Similarly, I would expect any hotel I stay to never allow it to get to the point that a review is necessary to have the hotel live up to its own standards.Like all hotel stays, there are hiccups along the way. Things happen when people are spending an extended period of time away from home, but there are unforgivable sins in the hospitality industry, especially in hospitality that compares itself to the St. Regis - one of the finest hotels in the world. We have stayed at two other Peninsula hotels in the world and though I will not compare The Peninsula to the St. Regis across the street, I think it more than fair to compare Peninsula brands and by any measure, The Peninsula New York failed in almost every way.Similar to all hotel stays and hiccups, there are always hotel employees that are unsung heroes of stays. In the case of The Peninsula New York, those employees work for housekeeping and room service. Almost everything they did was good and though there were issues related to communication with them (not that I could not communicate with them, rather that hotel staff did not seem to talk to each other) by and large they did a good job.There are a few things that must be worked on by the hotel’s best assets and above all else must be the end of the yelling in the hallways during service. Although we could not hear the housekeeping staff in the hallways in the bedroom, we could hear them in the living room and it is distracting beyond belief. There is no reason the housekeeping staff should be shouting at one another. Most hotel staff members are issued radios or cell phones, but Peninsula staff members seem to use the old fashioned art of yelling or talking loudly in the halls to communicate with one another. It’s distracting and unnecessary.Another issue we found was inconsistency with room service. Some things were good, but there were days when information given to us differed from information previous days. For instance, one morning I ordered a continental breakfast and very specifically asked if the pastries were baked in-house. I was assured they are (there really is nothing worse than store-bought pastries), but when they arrived the room service attendant told me they were not made by the pastry chef at all and were simply purchased and warmed here. It would not be a big deal, but I asked about them a couple days later and was told something different by the room service staff. The pastry chef either bakes pastries or they do not. Both things cannot be true at the same time, especially for the low quality of the baked goods and the fact that the bakery items are priced quadruple what they are a couple blocks away at Bouchon.Now to issues that the hotel must correct because they directly impact first impressions and continued impressions during a stay.I have never stayed at a hotel whose front of house staff were as dismissive and absent as those here at The Peninsula New York. It was our driver from the airport who asked a question that would last throughout our visit, “Where are the bellman?” As we arrived we sat in the car from the airport for a few minutes waiting for somebody to show up to greet us. It isn’t that we didn’t want to get out of the car - it was that there was nobody to help us. We waited for more than a few minutes and eventually somebody came. I chalked their absence up to the hotel being busy because it was days before Christmas, but as I soon learned, it was a systemic problem that was never to be corrected.On multiple occasions I went to the front of the hotel to get a cab and there was no doorman. ONE particular doorman always went above and beyond to get us a cab to go wherever we were going, but that was the exception and not the rule. As a rule, the bell staff was absent from the front of the hotel and there were days when I used an app or went to Fifth Avenue to get a cab myself. One day we went out to get a cab to dinner and there was one doorman on duty. He blew his whistle a few times and forgot about us. Cars with guests were arriving and they experienced the same thing we did: nobody to greet or help us. Drivers were asking the same question our driver asked and people were piling up in the front of the building. There were Peninsula employees watching this chaos unfold, but they were IN the hotel looking out - at no point did any of them decide to contact somebody to say the front of the hotel was chaotic.Finally, I did something I’d never done before: I called the hotel and asked for the front desk (we passed the desk some 20-minutes earlier on our way out) to send somebody outside to help us. Hotel employees soon rushed outside from all directions (noticeably absent from the scrum were actual bellman/doormen), but eventually employees outnumbered guests - which is how it should have been from the start.The front desk staffer that brought the cab to me said he apologized for the wait and I remarked how strange it was to have one bellman disappear only to leave guests requiring assistance, arriving guests, and departing ones on their own. His response was telling, “It is rush hour so things get busy.” I asked him what that had to do with the absence of staff, but there were a lot of other people around and he just mumbled something. I don’t know what he said, but it was the biggest sign of a crack in the shine of The Peninsula New York.From dinner that night I called the hotel and asked that my room be turned down. The person who answered the phone said she would pass the message to housekeeping and I was looking forward to a nice shower and bed. Unfortunately, the message never got to housekeeping and I had to call down for somebody to turn down the room. It took longer than it should have (waiting for the staff) and it was just another example of people in the hotel not talking to each other and lacking communication. It is not fair to compare one hotel to another, I know, but there were a great number of failures that happened at The Peninsula that did not have to happen due to people either not talking to each other or not talking about guest needs to one another.I could go on about the bell staff and the absence of the staff that are there to ensure guests have what they need, but there is something about having to track help down that bothers me. It is not like I am asking for anything that is not promised, but none of these kinds of issues happen at other Peninsula properties.Not only is the lack of communication between staff a problem for the hotel, but also communication between guests and the hotel is problematic. Consider something simple like getting shoes shined - something one would think would be second nature to a place where bags are provided for that purpose. One night the shoes were not returned and we found them at the room we spent our first night, another night our shoes were never picked up and we were going to an event the day we needed them and when I asked how long it would take I was told it could be up to overnight. I had them shined across the street, but sent another pair down just to have them the day before I needed them. This is something simple not complicated, but a change in room should never create a situation where guests decide to take it upon themselves to go searching for shoes that should have been hanging on the door the next morning. I guess I should be glad that the people ultimately assigned to the room we left after our first day woke late and didn’t decide that my shoes would be good for them.One day the hotel sent some wine to the room to apologize to us for some reason or another and we told the person who brought it that we do not drink. After we moved rooms the wine ended up in the new room we were assigned. I told the housekeeper that we do not drink and do not need the wine (it was being wasted on us) and she said that she would send room service to get it. A couple of days later it was still there and I called reception to let them know that we did not drink (they did not know it, but it was for not other reason than we just don’t drink, not because it is a temptation beyond any other) and it was not removed for days. When the wine finally went away it should have been replaced with a fruit bowl or something, not just taken away days later and re-gifted to somebody else noticing all the small things that were really problematic during their stay. I realize that the “issues” we faced at The Peninsula New York were undoubtedly first world problems, but when one is paying thousands of dollars a night to sleep somewhere for a long period of time there is an expectation that the hotel deliver what it promises. The Peninsula promises a five star experience that makes staying here similar to the St. Regis (a place it compares itself to), but the stays are not similar at all. There is part of me that says it is harsh to talk badly about a place that was your home for the holidays, but then again, I’m a Hanukkah guy not a Christmas one so it’s not really my holiday. I understand that people and hotels get busy, but you must be prepared for the busy season and you cannot simply count on guests being distracted by things in the hotel hoping that people will overlook the shortcomings.Whether or not we stay at The Peninsula New York again I am not sure. One thing I am sure about is that if you are looking for a place that is elegant and does Christmas well, The Peninsula New York certainly fits that bill. Rooms are lovely and there are nice touches for the holidays - like the Christmas tree and decorations in our room. What you should know is that if you are looking for service over anything else, this may not be the best place for you. If you are familiar with Peninsula brands in China, Hong Kong, Beverly Hills, or elsewhere, I’m not sure your expectations will be met here. The fact that they cannot communicate simple instructions to one another is a big problem. Add to that the number of problems compounded by the days we stayed and you have an eventful stay with little things that kept adding up. The people here mean well - of that there is no doubt - but either The Peninsula went with its B and C teams over the holidays or they have a young staff that is not used to being near capacity during the holidays.We appreciated our time here and we are thankful for their hospitality, but they really must do better if they are going to compare themselves to the true grand dames of New York hotels. I’m just sorry that things didn’t go as well as I would have liked - I liked and we enjoyed the understated elegance of The Peninsula and I only wish their staff would have put as much effort into making the stay a good one as we did in our desire for it to be an uneventful one without problems.","Los Angeles, California","Steven_SoCal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",36,3.0

However this time it was and is in need of a lot of changes. First, when I go to NYC for business which is often I always ask for a room no view on a quiet street, well that did not happen. Then the toilet was leaking all over the place. So they did not move me to an upgraded room, ( BTW this hotel is notorious for telling its Centurion guests that they dont have any available upgrades). I have complained to Centurion about this hotel in the past not abiding by its AMEX contract but that goes nowhere. So they take to another room that is the size of a matchbox and I turn it down and tell them to fix the toilet and go out for dinner. So I come back and the toilet is till leaking, i call done again and have to wait for another engineer to fix it and it’s now around 10:30 at night. They finally fix it and the next thing is the furnishings are dated and in need of replacement they have been like this for over a decade. The hotel is very busy and noisy and has a lot of other issues too many to go over.

The Hotel and its rooms are in beautiful shape, particularly with the Christmas decorations, and is located in the perfect NYC location, right off 5th Ave. Every night the hotel had Christmas carolers at the entrance, including singers from the Jersey Boys broadway show. The rooftop bar has a beautiful view of the City, as does the 21st floor pool, gym and spa, and the Gotham Lounge is a great spot to relax.But, it is the Hotel staff that truly made the experience exceptional, particularly the asst manager Giovanni Fillichio. Giovanni went out of his way to welcome us, giving us a tour of the hotel and amenities, and always available to point out a restaurant or NYC attraction to try, arranging for transportation, or just a seat at the Gotham lounge. It seemed as if we paused in the lobby for more than a couple minutes, Giovanni was there to make sure everything was going well, arrange transportation, or to give directions or assistance. The rest of the staff we encountered seem to follow Giovanni's example - they were outstanding in every way. We had breakfast served in our room twice.

Neither was true. We were received warmly and were upgraded without asking. We were there for my husbands birthday. I had not told the hotel but the doorman heard me ask my husband if he was enjoying his birthday trip. On our return from the show we were attending a birthday desert was in our room.

Bathroom was roomy. I just thought there would be more brand consistency. The location was great, close to Central Park, walking distance to Times Square and Broadway.

Our card allows for upgrades when possible and they actually bumped us 2x to a grand executive suite. Separate living room and very spacious. Kids room was the same- very spacious. Bathrooms didn’t disappoint either. Everything was super clean and felt new as compared to some of the other 5 stars we’ve stayed at. Had a view of 5th ave which was nice. Had breakfast and evening drinks at the hotel and it was excellent. They have a main bar / restaurant and they have a lounge area with oversized couches and comfortable chairs. Kids enjoyed the snacks and appetizers. They have a rooftop bar that is pretty cool also. Took a swim in the pool one afternoon with the kids- not a place you’d go because of the pool but it was a treat to have one. Kids like being across the street from the park, and this is a few blocks away. But, this was a nice change as it is closer to most of the shopping and a little closer to the shows. It’s hard to complain about the prices when they upgrade you like they did us, but the food and drinks were a little pricey, even compared to some of the other places we’ve stayed.

Great location and front of house staff who really want to please you. The room itself was large, very clean and the bed was very comfortable. But...this hotel is not of the standard we have experienced in other cities around the world. The hotel felt very tired in ALL the communal areas - lifts and corridors, furniture in rooms. We paid £2300 for 3 nights (excluding breakfast) but we won’t be back. I feel sort of torn between staff who are really keen to deliver but a product that just doesn’t. The hotel felt dated and in certain areas absolutely not 5 star - the pool area was closed but that was no big deal and did not affect our opinion as it looked dated and small. Gym was ok but not great. £700 a night in Europe buys you the absolute top notch - this felt like a 4 star hotel trying to keep up.

The reviews that I wrote are usually on a positive note where I carefully notate my interactions with staff, experiences on property, etc. On this particular visit, immediately upon checking in, I walked into a whirlwind of negativity. As the female (her name escaped me) at the front desk gretted us, there was a gentleman on the opposite side of her who was dealing with an extremely irate guest/guest representative. I mean this lady was yelling at the top of her lungs going on and on about how it’s complete bulls*** that they made her come to the desk to pay for the room because they couldn’t take her card number over the phone. The gentleman was very mild mannered and politely explained to her that it was company policy. Her response was “oh that’s a load of crap”. She kept pushing at the fact that she is “sick with cancer” and they “made her” come to the front desk to pay, etc. The gentleman apologized and did his best to placate her. She stated that she was paying for the room for the actress Nia Long, I can only assume that this woman must’ve been part of the booking company because I don’t understand how such an unprofessional person could be representing such a well-known actress in this manner. She proceeded to name the company and when the gentleman told her the total for the room (including taxes) she went on another tangent stating that they “don’t pay taxes” and that he HAS to give her “a better price” and questioned why the second night was more expensive than the first. This woman was so loud and so obnoxious. The fact that I know all of these details speaks to the fact of how loud she was being. After completing check-in, the young lady walked us to the elevator and I asked her the name of the gentleman at the desk (whom I now knew to be Nicholas). The young lady asked if everything was ok and I said yes. After being in the room for about ten minutes or so, I received a phone call from the front desk; it was Nicholas. He called to see if we were settled in and to also apologize for the commotion upon check-in. This was something he most certainly did not have to do. He went out of his way to call and apologize, for HER actions! I thanked him and told him that he handled the situation very well and that someone’s illness gives them absolutely not right to belittle him and be so disrespectful. Needless to say, this was a true display of how well staff receives training here as well as the quality of the individuals employed. Moving on....Our room was number 2006 and it was quite comfortable and welcoming. There was even a nice welcome note left on the desk. The bathroom was spacious and housekeeping always kept everything tidy. They have a state of the art gym with all the bells and whistles (the view of the city from there isn’t bad either). The rooftop bar/lounge is simply divine. You have the option of sitting inside or outside. I’d sit outside on a nice night if I were you. Fun note: I always know little fun facts about the places I visit and sometimes I asks staff questions to see if the know the answers. I asked the bellman why the restaurant was named ‘Clement’, and to my surprise, he actually knew that it was named after the CEO of the Peninsula hotel chain. Kudos to him! This was an interesting fact that my husband and I learned when we met the CEO on a prior vacation in the Caribbean.","Miami, Florida","AleciaUnique</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",34,5.0

Based on those experiences, which were all amazing, I went into this visit in Manhattan with high expectations. We decided to book this hotel for a last minute trip to NYC for my birthday. That all said, I can say beyond a shadow of a doubt, that Peninsula New York delivered 110%.Room:Our room was very large. It had an amazing king size bed with luxiorious down pillows, down comforter and extremely comfortable mattress. It was so quiet. Having stayed in other NYC hotels, noise always seems to be an issue. Our room at the Peninsula, was beyond quiet. You could hear a pin drop. The bathroom feels like a spa. Marble everywhere, large walk-in shower with multiple shower heads, separate soaking tub, and separate commode with private door. The room has many places to store all your clothes, a large hanging closet and plentiful wet bar.Clement Restaurant:We ate here for breakfast daily. Each day I had the Maine lobster with kale, heirloom tomatoes, poached eggs and freshly squeezed beet and carrot juice. The service is impeccable. Everyone of the waiters is top notch. You'd be hard pressed to find a better place to start the day.Spa:We used the spa daily. The pool is amazing. Located on the 22nd floor. You are literally swimming amongst skyscapers. The steam room and sauna provided a nice respite after spending time in the hustle and bustle of the streets of Manhattan. Salon de Ning:This is a top-notch rooftop bar. The views are amazing and the drinks and food are delicious. You pay to play here no doubt but it's worth it 100%Overall building condition:This hotel is celebrating its 30th year. The overall condition of the public areas, hallways and rooms are excellent. Sure there are areas that need some attention but that is true of every hotel.Staff:This is where the Peninsula absolutely shines. A luxury hotel that employs staff that look after their guests makes the visit amazing every time. We had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with the general manager, Jonathan Crook as well as the front office manager, Hannah Heyer. Obviously the leadership of this Peninsula are doing right things because these two individuals ensured a perfect visit for us. Every other staff member we met delivered service in a similar exemplary style. The staff in each area of the hotel was warm, friendly, accommodating, and a lovely representation of the brand. Overall we had an amazing stay. We look forward to coming back and were sad to leave. These are feelings that are very rarely felt when leaving a hotel.

We were given a complimentary upgrade to a 5th Avenue view room, and for that I was very grateful. Inconsistency was my main issue with not having a more memorable trip, and for not giving a higher rating. There were services that were missed the first night, but were offered the second (like turn down service, or bucket of ice) - which were not a huge deal, but left me feeling that maybe something was overlooked the first night? The thermostat and the volume on the bathroom TV were not working, but were fixed when I brought to the front desk's attention the next morning. Again, bathroom TV volume was not a huge deal, but one of those nice touches that ""would have been nice"" and in character with what I had perceived to be part of the Peninsula branding. I had a small child with me that thoroughly enjoyed having that feature the second night, so while we were grateful for the fix, part of me feels it should have been working for both nights. A working thermostat was more important, as we did not have heat - we were FREEZING!The remote control also was barely working, though not sure if that was because of the batteries or if it was the age of the TV system - looks and feels very clunky and dated. Did not bother bringing that to the staff's attention, but adds to a general (surprisingly) dumpy feel for such a well-regarded hotel. The details were noticed, and did not seem in line with the average $1000/night pricepoint. There is nothing negative for me to share, but it did feel ""mediocre"" for their quality tier. If you are out and about sightseeing, it will be fine for you to come back to this hotel and rest in their beautiful surroundings. We are locals who wanted a more hotel-based getaway, so were more reliant on the in-room features than perhaps other visitors might be, so please factor that as well in processing our comments. Overall we had a good stay. Staff was always pleasant. Issues that were brought to their attention were rectified in one or two phone calls the next day. I would have been very ok to not receive an upgrade but to have a room in working order",NYC,"twasbrillig</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NYC</strong>",11,3.0

Here’s the story. My wife wanted to take her 9 year old granddaughter to the ABT ballet for her birthday. We saw the afternoon tea which is related to the ballet and Espie (the granddaughter) was super excited to do this as well. We called to reserve a spot then booked the ballet for the same day. Yesterday morning, they texted my wife to confirm. All set except we get a phone message 2 hours later saying that had to cancel because they booked another event instead. While we planned our day around the tea and coming in from Rhode Island, we can understand that things happen but the way we were treated as we attempted to speak to someone went like this; After being shifted and transferred numerous times then hung up on, we finally got someone on the phone who basically told us unapologetically that we were out of luck because they booked “a better event”. Now I’m the first to acknowledge that a $60 a person afternoon tea doesn’t carry much weight when you charge $600 a night for a room but you would think a hotel of this stature would offer some form of reasonable customer service and/or some form of offer to remedy the matter. AND we were told we would get a call right back to speak to the food and service manager. No call...I vent because there’s nothing worse than disappointing a 9 year old girl on her birthday. She probably would’ve enjoyed the tea more than the ballet. ","Trumbull, Connecticut","fredbonilla815</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Trumbull, Connecticut</strong>",21,1.0

I understand that they could be busy but I felt that they were understaffed and this is the second arrival that no one came to greet me.2: I have sleep apnea and use a Cpap machine therefore I need an outlet to plug my machine into.One would think that a five star hotel would have an outlet next to the bed to charge ur phone etc, however the Peninsula does not.My last stay I had the same issue, and I informed the hotel twice before my stay and confirmed upon check in to make sure their is an extension cord in my room.I get up to my room at about 1130pm and low and behold there is no extension cord, sure enough someone came up to set it up, but at 1130 pm coming back to the room tired, u want to go to sleep and not have to deal with this.3: I asked the Conceirge if the house Car would be available half an hour bf I wanted to go out, I was told that it was all booked up. I said that how can it be booked in advance as it’s supposed to be first come first served.After I mentioned that the chef Conceirge Freddy said that in that case he would arrange for the rolls Royce to take me.I am not a Car person, but I was looking forward to this experience. Low and behold, I get down and they gave me a Cadillac. Now don’t get me wrong, I am appreciative of a house Car, but when I am promised something, I expect it, and to get something different with no explanation (the rolls was there, but apparently it was reserved for a vip), is disappointing.4: The elevators were horrible, upon checkin there was a 15 minute wait for an elevator...All in all ur was a disappointing and underwhelming stay, and for $800+ a night do urself a favour and go to the Pierre or St. Regis",Toronto,"JoshSal</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto</strong>",2,2.0

Its in the best location, and has wonderful staff. If you are expecting the glitz of the Plaza, or the sharp newness of the Park Hyatt, you might be disappointed with the Peninsula. However, if you prefer the elegant home of a wealthy relative, where things are thought out and beautiful, this is the place. We has a junior suite facing the street, and it was beautiful; not as large as you might expect, but fine for 2 people. The spa is all you could expect, with steam, pool and sauna. There are fitness classes as well as full gym. The breakfast is not the stuff yourself buffet, but full-service menu of delicious items...best French toast I have ever had anywhere. There is a downstairs clubby bar, and an upstairs hipster roof. Both were welcoming and friendly, but totally different vibes. Having stayed at FS, Mark, Plaza and Palace, this is a good choice for its staff, comfort, location, and sheer luxury.

It never happened to me, in any other 5-star hotel in the world, to be told ""I am sorry sir, there are no tables available"" for breakfast: this is something that the Manager of this property shall take very seriously...4) As hotel sits on 5th Avenue, some rooms can be pretty noisy: mine was fortunately on a high floor, but colleagues who were on lower floors complained about noise levels.5) While the rooftop bar is really unique, the quantity of people around is just too much: on the day I left, there was a 10 minute queue at the lift to get to the rooftop, which is ridiculous, just to get upstairs and find that the bar looks as crowded as Times Square on New Year's eve...I am very sorry, but this hotel is housed in a building which dramatically needs redesign and a fresh refurbishment, and is definitely badly managed.If it weren't for its address and for belonging to one of the most prestigious luxury hotel chains in the world, this hotel would be gone long ago.Sorry, but this is the hard truth.","Milan, Italy","Alexej69</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milan, Italy</strong>",88,2.0

There were many little things that made for an overall disappointing stay, but after our return home and communication with the hotel, they tried to make it right. I will not go into great detail here, but I must advise you to request a room that is not near the service elevators. We were exhausted by the second night of what we had hoped would be a relaxing and restful stay, due to the loud rumbling and vibration caused by the service elevator. Moving to another room around one a.m. the second night of our stay helped, but no one should ever be put in that room to begin with. Follow up from The Peninsula took my one star review up to three stars, but I cannot rate it any higher than that. It is nice that they care, but sometimes it’s too little too late. Dinner at Clement was excellent, as was the service at the restaurant. The spa was also lovely, and I wished that we had spent more time there. Had our experience at The Peninsula NYC been just based on dinner and the spa, it would have been perfect. Service during our stay at the hotel in other areas fell short.I don’t think we would stay at The Peninsula NYC again, but we dined at L’Oiseau inside of The Peninsula Paris last summer and fell in love with it, so I would definitely stay at other Peninsula locations, especially in Paris.

The hotel, without exception, is the finest hotel overall in New York. I say overall because the review here encompasses not just what you get in a room but the service by hotel staff members. For New York City, I was amazed by the sincerity and genuine, friendly staff members. I had 2 visitors traveling to NYC from Italy to see the city for the first time. I wanted to make sure their experience was an enjoyable one. I cannot say enough praises for this hotel. It has the luxury and charm of 5 star but unlike the other luxury hotels, it offers a friendly atmosphere that you don't find in comparable hotels such as The Plaza. This hotel has old historic charm and yet successfully juxtaposes its history with a modern flair throughout while still maintaining an elegant and traditional impression - not easy to do! The result is a hotel that will appeal to all world travelers and delivers what one would expect in an elegant yet unpretentious New York fine hotel.Upon arrival the experience was very positive from the moment we arrived by car - immediately staff was there to accommodate on luggage, taking us to meet concierge who greeted us and took us to the front desk while finding an assistant to deliver our luggage to the room. Parking is provided by the hotel making it very easy to come by car. About $65/day which for mid-town Manhattan is standard. You also have the option to park in any area garage you wish. As a wonderful perk, The Peninsula does offer complimentary car service from Cadillac SUVs by drivers to luxury BMW limousine service we were offered complimentary to Lincoln Center for a night show to their own driver driven MiniCooper vehicles that can be sheduled making it so convenient to get somewhere on time if need be without worrying about your own vehicle and parking services - all complimentary! Even before arrival the hotel was in contact to welcome and assist by email. The room was everything you expect in a 5 star hotel - the decor was very elegant, in the best taste - the neutral color schemes of whites, beiges, black marble, cream marble and gold finishes were as understated as a Chanel suit. Beautifully relaxing atmosphere with large windows - the room was an Executive Suite with fresh plants, a beautiful Welcome compote of fresh fruits, the most luxurious toiletries in bathroom from Oscar de la Renta. The room is equipped with high technology including a bathtub television, bedside room and lighting controls. The bathroom itself was in total luxury in black marbles and cream stones with bathrobes and large enough for more than one person to comfortably show, bath use the sink and separate room for toilet. Everything was well thought out -the interior designer did an amazing job - you instantly felt impressed. The views from this room of the skyline and city center were amazing. The hotel boasts restaurants and bars to have a meal, a snack or enjoy a cocktail or hot drink. The lobby as well as other areas of the hotel features fresh flowers but also live plants and greenery wherever you go - there is nothing fake and everything is done first class. The lobby area features a small shop and easy to use/find restrooms making it convenient while touring the town and stopping by quickly without having to go upstairs to your room. The doormen and conceirge service teams are extraordinary. While other hotels expect patrons to pay a stiff tip, the team here gave you the impression they truly wanted to assist and enjoy their role in offering the best hospitality. Everyone smiled, everyone greeted you, everyone was very friendly without being sugary. To our amazement, the front desk upon hearing it was our first visit to The Peninsula offered a quick tour of the hotel premises - amazing especially for New York City! We were shown around the lobby, taken up the elevator to peruse the luxury spa that also offers hair salon and beauty services, a 24 hour huge fitness center offering classes and training, a bar area upstairs with views of the skyline. And 2 other best kept secrets by the wealthy who surely know this hotel very well: a huge enclosed solarium swimming pool I believe on the 21 or 22nd floor with sweeping views of Fifth Avenue and a peek towards Central Park! Absolutely amazing and surreal. To be in your swimsuit diving into a beautiful large swimming pool surrounded by floor to ceiling glass windows looking out to the traffic along Fifth Avenue! With plenty of seating and lounge chairs if you just wish to relax and read a book to get away from it all. The fitness gym features a full lockeroom with complimentary fruit and water and robes and towels and even slippers for walking around - with staff to assist. And the other best kept secret is the high floor (20 or 21st floor) garden terrace with lounge chairs and open air views along a full expanse patio balcony area that sweeps around the 3 sides of the hotel on Fifth Avenue so you can relax and enjoy the sunshine among sparkling skyscrapers and views of Central Park as well as incomparable views of center city Manhattan. My guests stayed for several days and each day we experienced the same consistent outstanding service from staff and I know they were thrilled with the room itself - which I should note was very roomy and larger than any other NYC hotel room I have experienced. And with its central location just blocks away from every major midtown attraction a guest would fully enjoy their time in New York City staying here. I send compliments to the dedicated staff, the outstanding management direction and to the Peninsula Group for creating an example of high level hospitality.","New York, NY","WorldOneNY</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York, NY</strong>",42,5.0

It was our last night in Manhattan and it was the 29th November which meant the tree lighting ceremony was happening at Rockefeller Centre, so we wanted to stay somewhere close but also wanted a bit of luxury...We hit the jackpot when it came to the Peninsular! From the moment I made our booking till the moment we checked out, the service we received from the hotel was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced before, completely 5 Star and beyond.Caroline was amazing, she helped make sure everything was in place for us when we arrived. She had arranged a special surprise for my son who was turning 2 years old in 2 days time, so it was the start of our early celebrations. She made the whole stay incredibly smooth and stress free, even assisting us with arranging a driver to get us down towards lower Manhattan for some last minute sightseeing. Rebecca was equally amazing! She helped me arrange a date-night evening in our room since my husband and i couldn’t get out to a fancy dinner with a 2 year old. She helped me prior to arrived arrange a personalized 3 course menu which the chef prepared for us in-room. She even ensured a copy of the menu was printed in our room on arrival. The food was absolutely spectacular! The rooms themselves are beautiful and you can’t pass up a relaxing bubble bath whilst watching some TV! The amenities with the room like Oscar De La Renta toiletries is a nice touch. The personalized letter sitting on our coffee table when we checked into our room. The little personalized dessert for my son’s birthday... it’s all the little touches which make you feel absolutely special. Yes, I will admit - the pricing isn’t cheap. And admittedly, when I booked I got a very good deal at the time... but I can understand why you pay a premium... you’re not just paying for a room or location but the wholistic experience!I honestly didn’t want to leave! I am counting down the days until I’m in New York again and I will definitely be making a return stay at The Peninsula... (I’m starting my savings now)!

Bathrooms are particularly clean. The 4-Star rating is due to our following opinion. Other travelers may have no issues with these and may think these are non-issues:As a Chinese-owned hotel brand, it should be no surprise that coffee and espresso makers were NOT in the rooms. For $50, and if there were any available, you could request one be placed in your room. Not a huge issue as you could take the elevator to the 21st floor pool to make an espresso, hot tea or latte. No top sheets—we requested a top sheet on our bed and received it. However, the next evening it was removed and we were left to sleep with just the comforter. (On this subject—Housekeeping did a thorough job twice a day.) Soaps & toiletries—Oscar de la Renta brand. Strange right? Not great, super cheap despite the designer name and certainly not fitting for a luxury hotel. Think your local health club’s liquid shower soap. Bring your own! We were expecting Milton Brown, Kiehl’s or higher end for the room price of $640/nite. Personalization of hotel staff with guests—the personalization and facial recognition of hotel staff with their guests was indifferent. No greeting the guest by name, little remembrance of guests day after day, hotel staff didn’t look us in the eye when speaking. Obviously these aren’t necessary in a hotel stay but we have always appreciated the hospitality of luxury hotel staff. This is not part of the hospitality of the concierge and front desk at the Peninsula NY. That being said, all staff were very pleasant. Compared to the Ritz, The Carlyle...quite different. The fitness club had Peloton bikes and a fabulous staff! The Pool staff was good, too. The Salon de Ning is worth a visit at nite to see the skyline on the outdoor rooftop terrace. Concierge had excellent restaurant suggestions and made reservations for us. Doormen not attentive but pleasant.

I believe it is priced so much higher than nearby competitors (e.g., Quin) because it has the spa with indoor pool, sauna, and steam room. But if you are traveling with a busy business schedule, you won't have time to use those things anyway. The gym is well stocked with lots of treadmills, a stair machine, several spinning bikes, free weights/kettle bells, jump ropes, and Nautilus-type weight machines, yet lacks some basics like an aerobic step (for box jumps) and only had one fitness ball (those big ones). Bonus: they offer a variety of free group fitness classes including early morning weekday classes suitable for business travelers, and reasonably-priced personal training sessions and massages. The rooms lack in-room coffee makers but have well-stocked minibars. The room service fare is delicious and priced comparable to other luxury hotels (and bonus: offers some all-day breakfast selections, which I liked). Room had excellent lighting and a well-stocked and well-lit desk with a laser printer (!) and office supplies like a stapler and highlighter. If I'd been able to connect and print things, it would have been great, but who travels with the necessary cable to connect your laptop to a printer? I would rather have had an in-room bluetooth speaker, which the room lacked. Bathroom is equipped with a TV above the tub (but if you are traveling for business, I doubt you'll get any use from this). All customer service personnel were top notch.

So this was my first stay at a Peninsula hotel.From start to beginning it was just great. The best hotels are often defined with how they deal with problems. We got a room that we did not feel where entirely cleaned. Called down and got a new room straight away. Not questions just interested in us being comfortable.Top floor bar was great with good selection of both food and drinks. Restaurant served good atmosphere and great food and drinks. Heck, even roomservice food was better than expected.The mini cooper service was a wonderfull experience that took us across downtown in a three hour sightseeing session. Room was big enough to work from aswell.Gym had an amazing view, spa was great also.We do travel alot and have som great experiences previously. It is then very nice to exeperience quality like this.

I don't know how old it is or when it was last renovated but after spending time at the Peninsula in Paris, I know it needs updating. The one in Paris has iPads to control everything in the room and you can even order room service. The one on 5th is definitely older. We had a small room with an adjoining living room ( king size bed). I felt very cramped. Not much room in the room where bed was located. One morning i arrived at breakfast to find they had stopped serving at 10:30. I honestly was shocked! So I walked to the Four Seasons and had breakfast there. I usually stay at the Four Seasons but I decided to change it up and regretted it. I will say it is in a wonderful location. Very close to Central Park and right on 5th Ave with all the fabulous shopping.

Location is right in the heart of midtown and just a few steps away from great shopping, restaurants, and the Central Park. Have a drink at Fives and enjoy the view overlooking 5th Avenue. The spacious, well-kept room was filled with fine amenities and even a touch-screen display that controlled everything from the room lighting, temperature, TV, and even the ""Do Not Disturb Sign"". It was a nice ""high tech"" touch for this more reserved property. Glad we opted for the courtyard as we never once heard the typical NY night street noise. We stay at world-class hotels worldwide and the Peninsula in NYC measures right up to the others. I would return on our next visit in spring and recommend this hotel to the most discerning traveler. Be sure to check their Internet package specials.

Flying from CA - NY is daunting enough but to then be faced with rude and unhelpful service upon arrival is COM[LETELY unacceptable. We arrived Thursday evening at 9:15 and did not want to eat in the bar AGAIN as it is uncomfortable and lame for dining. The restaurant was already closed due to the fact it was ""off season"" so we asked to take the ""house car"" to a restaurant that the front desk recommended. The very weak concierge told us the house car had stopped running 15 minutes earlier. Yes, we could have taken Uber or a taxi but the issue is that the concierge could have stepped up and offered alternate suggestions or even apologized, The concierge can take a page out of Nordstrom's C/.S book to assist the customer paying over $800- per night.Our previous stay in November 2017 had so many negative issues that the front desk supervisor said on our next stay ( this stay) our room would be ""upgraded twice"" on an upper floor. We were on the 16th floor yet the room was not an upgrade from previous stays.Main issues revolve around the executive office (rude and uncaring), the front desk staff and the concierge. This hotel has the potential to be 5 star but not until the guest is valued concerns are immediately addressed. I MUST say the door men and bell staff are REMARKABLE! Fully attentive to the needs of the guests even before you realize it's a need. They're awesome and the reason the Peninsula is a 5-star hotel.","San Jose, California","Marzipan-pan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",1,3.0

The rooftop was great even in the November Winter evening, as they have space heaters by the tables. The patrons were all beautiful dressed, and the view of the city was beautiful. Inside was just a nice, and we did that as well. Great service and ambiance. If I had any complaint at all, it would be that there were cigarette trays on the outside tables, so some people were smoking, which is so foreign to us Californians. If I could change that one thing, then it would be absolutely perfect.

While we did not using the bar or dining room in the hotel we did have Christmas dinner in the hotel (delicious) and received surprise chocolates on Christmas Day. This is a delightful hotel for those that don't mind spending a little extra for some old world charm. One final word to the team in the fitness/spa area - their attentiveness, customer service and for generally giving great service every day cannot go unmentioned, for us this was the best hotel gym and spa facilities we have encountered ever and all credit to the team that run it - thank you Penninsula you made my surprise Christmas break a really special event.","Edinburgh, United Kingdom","MRAW2011</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Edinburgh, United Kingdom</strong>",14,5.0

This was put right. Irritation on the shower as rain shower would not go off when using hand shower so got my hair wet, had to use the bath shower to avoid wetting hair as maintenance advised that is how the shower was and several residents complained about it.

Sadly, it seemed that the hotel hadn't adequately prepared its staff to deal with the holiday rush.There was a bit of a wait to valet our car. Once we were able to get out staff quickly helped us with our bags. Check in was fast, and we appreciated an upgraded room, though there was a line of other impatient guests forming around us during the process. The room itself was very spacious by NY standards, and would have been extremely luxurious in the late 1980s. The dated lighting control panels, anachronistic fax lines, and small, cathode-ray tube TV in the bathroom seemed out of place in a hotel charging an advertised $1300/night. Linens were excellent, the bed felt tired (and extremely springy). No iPod dock or speaker system, and only one bank of outlets worked in our room (none near the bed). The bathroom was large and comfortable, though our tap leaked water onto the granite counter.The best parts of our stay were the pool - which is lovely - and the housekeeping service, which was flawless, with turn-downs at night and wonderful small touches. The unexpected, less tangible experiences you might expect at a luxury property were harder to come by. We never were able to visit the rooftop bar, Salon de Ning, as it was closed for private events both nights. As it was 10 degrees outside, we decided to spend the afternoon of the 31st in the hotel. When we wanted coffee, we were directed to the Gotham lounge where we were told they were only accepting reservations. The hostess suggested the hotel's restaurant. After walking across the lobby, we discovered it too was closed for service and we were turned away. The reception desk helped us find seats at the bar back at the Gotham lounge, where we were charged $45 for two coffees and a half-dollar sized piece of cheesecake. Only later did we discover small snacks and a free espresso machine in the spa lounge (pro tip!), which would have suited us just fine. When we mentioned that the team should stop sending patrons to the hotel restaurant, as it too was closed, the staff started suggesting potential tea-takers to head across the street to the St. Regis. We began to wonder if we should have done the same when booking a hotel.We requested champagne flutes and a bucket of ice at a particular time, which arrived 1.5 hours early. Ordering room service was a fiasco. I was transferred twice, then told someone would call me back. When I called again ten minutes later, the front desk took my order. When I was told it would take 45 minutes to receive a cheese plate, the person apologized and told me the kitchen was extremely busy. The cheese plate was good! When we called to have the cart taken away, no one came. We finally rolled it out into the hallway. It stayed there until we checked out the following afternoon. The hotel's cars were only available to be used in a small radius around the hotel. As we were traveling farther downtown, we were quoted a rate of $188/hour with a minimum four hour booking for a driver. The hotel's Minis are a nice marketing idea, but not especially useful.There were armies of attendants, porters, and representatives in the lobby at all times. We felt welcomed, but only once were we helped with the door. I began to wonder what the purpose was of such a large staff, as we didn't see a commensurate level of service. Others have mentioned that the St. Regis, Plaza, or Waldorf have much more welcoming lobbies for lounging or meeting guests. If you're looking for a large, comfortable room in midtown with an upscale vibe and few lingerers beyond hotel guests, The Peninsula may be a good option for you. If you're looking for exceptional service or facilities to explore and enjoy, you may be better off looking elsewhere.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","classicred900</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",6,3.0

I've been coming on and off for years, and it's always delivered in multiple ways. This stay was no different. Prior to arrival they arranged for upgraded rooms (Grand Luxe) and an early noon check-in. Immediately greeted curbside by name from a front desk worker, I knew I would be welcomed to Peninsula's brand of subdued luxury for the new few nights. The grand luxe rooms are generous in size - though not full suites - and quite well appointed with numerous small touches in the sleeping and bath areas. The windows are soundproof, TV and lighting centrally controlled, and beds fitted with top tier linens. I especially liked the silent heating/ac. Turndown and daily maid service was done very efficiently and constantly restocked all items. The lobby was extremely well secured and had a fun kids candy shop setup for Santa to give kids limitless goodies. A highlight was the pool, spa, gym on the 21-23rd floors. The pool has space , even in winter, to lounge and look across midtown. The gym had excellent brand new equipment with attendants standing ready to assist. And the Spa itself - I had a massage - was flat out the best I've ever experienced. Too nice to really describe - but the men's relaxation lounge, pre-session team room, treatment room itself, and locker room with sauna and steam were top of the line. I don't usually splurge, but this was my wife pushing me to go and I was happy she did. The Peninsula is not huge, it's not extremely welcoming to non-overnight guests (outside the rooftop bar with is very welcoming) since it doesn't have a huge public lobby like the Plaza, the St Regis, Waldorf or the Palace. And that's I guess an appealing feature for me. When you choose to stay in central midtown at a 5 star hotel, what do you really want? If it's a beautiful room, perfect service at your fingertips, a pampering spa, and quiet, then stay here.","White Plains, New York","Droolio</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>White Plains, New York</strong>",62,5.0
