My sis left her watch on the table but came back to find it missing. We thought it was a mistake given the great reviews for this hotel so we raised it to the hotel and the hotel reassured us that they will check with their cleaning staff. They did not get back to us until we asked about it when we were checking out. To which they simple told us that the item was not seen and could not be found.Unfortunately, as we were rushing to catch our flight, we left behind an iPad Pro in the room which we were using just that morning. On the direct train to the domestic airport, we realised that it was left behind (only an hour has passed) and called up the hotel, hoping that they would keep the iPad until we returned to Tokyo a couple of days later. But the hotel informed us that the room has been cleaned and there was no iPad to be found. There was no way that the iPad was left anywhere else and we clearly remembered that we left it in the room. Such a dishonest hotel should be avoid at all costs. What an expensive lesson to be learnt. Perhaps Tokyu stay next door would be a better option.","Singapore, Singapore","eatsleeptravelsf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",0,1.0

While the rooms are small, they are clean with comfortable beds and a nice walk in shower and separate soaking tub to help compensate for their lack of an onsen. What's great about the Solaria is its location. Its just a 2 minute walk to the Higashi-Ginza subway station, a five minute walk to the Mitsukoshi department store, and a short 10 minute walk to the Tsukiji outer fish market which is still in operation and just as vibrant as before. There are lots of restaurants in the area, including the #1 rated nodoguro fish restaurant in Tokyo just across the street from the hotel. Expensive, but its the best fish you'll ever eat in Japan. Last time I didn't enjoy the hotel’s odd breakfast buffet which provided only salad, juice and coffee on the buffet line and a choice of three fixed breakfast plates that they serve you. But this time, they added fruit, yogurt and panna cotta to the buffet table and you now have 4 different breakfast plates to choose from. Surprisingly, they were all good and quite satisfying even though you still can't get more unless you want more salad, fruit, yogurt, panna cotta or coffee. If that doesn't work, you can always go to Family Mart a block away to find something to eat. While the front desk staff speak little English, you can still figure it out. They earnestly try to help which is all that you can ask for.

While it is possible to take a direct subway from Haneda airport to the hotel (the nearest subway stop ""Higashi Ginza"" is one minute away and you don't have to change trains), this 30 minute option requires you to carry your luggage up the subway staircase (exit A8). We opted instead for a 25 minute taxi ride at a cost of JPY 7,800.I agree with a previous reviewer about the service being barely average from the Japanese staff. It seemed that they were unwilling to help us because of the language barrier, though they were unfailingly polite at all times. There was only one receptionist who spoke passable English and helped us with restaurant reservations upon arrival. (our request to reserve restaurants prior to arrival, via email, was denied)The rooms are definitely compact if you are used to US-sized hotel rooms. Our floor space in our twin room was barely big enough to open my luggage.

My husband and I were extremely happy with the location of the hotel which allowed us to walk to and from the subway for our Haneda airport flights, and to walk to the train station for the trip to Osaka, although the train station might be outside what some would consider an acceptable walking distance. We found nearby restaurants, coffee, and convenience stores all within a few blocks of the hotel on safe, well lit streets. The room for both stays was small (what room in Japan is not?), functional and very clean. The rooms had extra towels and toiletries, a room safe, new slippers and pajamas on the bed for guest use, hair dryer, etc. We did not want for anything.

The room is small at 24sqm, however this is common with similarly priced hotels like Park hotel and Royal park in Shiodome. The beds can be pushed together to create a bit of extra floor space for suitcases and the bed is very comfortable, not too hard.The bathroom is really well designed. It is not high rise so don't expect views from your room and being a smaller hotel the lobby/reception is small.

Speaking no Japanese, I was initially concerned about the staff's English skills after reading reviews, but fear not - the staff's English is excellent. The check-in and check-out process was very quick and easy, and our room was ready before the 3pm check in. They were also very helpful with providing information to areas around the hotel and getting to/from the airport (the Narita bus stops just about 3-4 blocks away, so you don't need to drag your bags to Tokyo Station, which is just under a mile away).The room, as mentioned earlier, was quite small. We had a king bed, and the images of rooms with two doubles show a considerably larger room. The room was excellent though - the bathrooms were especially good - and it was very quiet and the beds were very comfortable. There is no dresser or storage for your clothes, only a very shallow closet, so keep that in mind. My wife and I are okay in tighter spaces, so it didn't bother us too much. The television, for English speakers, only had one channel - BBC World - and about 10 other stations in Japanese.The location of this hotel and its good price make this a great selection for your next trip to Tokyo. There are two Starbucks within 2 blocks, there's a food court nearby and plenty of high-end shopping in the neighborhood. The Ginza subway stop is just two blocks away (look for exit 12), and if you are going onwards any further, we found it easier to walk directly to Tokyo Station rather than take the Ginza line from Ginza to Tokyo, which seemed to have just as much walking in underground metro tunnels.","Tucson, Arizona","Bryan R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tucson, Arizona</strong>",22,4.0

Almost every question I posed was greeted first by a blank stare and then 10-15 minutes of 2-3 desk staff people scurrying around doing research on the Internet and printing out useless pages of information.

In Japan, there is a particular ""businessman's hotel"" which is sort of standardized. I guess you can consider it sort of like a hilton type model, as many of them are chains, however, Japanese standards are not like other standards, and these hotels are quite amazing and good and many of them are very well designed. They feel more like boutique hotels rather than a chain, especially the lobby and lounge areas. The only issue to watch out for is size of the rooms, but fortunately, Solaria was a totally normal sized room with a little sofa and desk area. Since I am only 5 feet tall, proportions don't matter as much to me, but I found this hotel quite adequate. both nights I had a bath in the very deep tubs and I found the hotel room bright and quiet. This hotel comes with the standard amenities of a business hotel (meaning, everything!!!) bath salts, toothbrushes, shampoos, and a million other amenities you probably didn't realize you needed in the bathroom. I did not eat the breakfast, but instead walked straight to tsujiki which is only about 10 minutes away for 830 am sushi and walked the markets. The hotel location is actually quite quite fabulous. very close to ginza train stations which there are several options, and about 900 yen taxi ride to Tokyo station. It's just removed from all the hustle and bustle of ginza, yet still extremely convenient. Mitsukoshi department store is right next door where you can go to the food halls in the basement(everyone needs to experience a department store food hall once in japan) and have some amazing local snacks and my fave stationary store K.itoya is close. There is a starbucks on every corner but there are also many better cafe's open (just not all of them open at 7 which is what I needed).","Brooklyn, New York","templeroad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brooklyn, New York</strong>",36,4.0

Very near the train station but other reviewers are correct - if you have luggage, use the exit with the elevator which is across the street from the hotel. You will have to roll all your luggage to cross the street then walk a little to get to the street of the hotel; it was really manageable. And coming from Haneda, the train stops in Ginza, no transfers. The fare was ¥610.Reserved 3 rooms for our family w/ bfast for 2 per room. Upon check in, without any prodding, the staff offered that the 2 kids with us would get free bfast. At bfast the next day, they didn't honor that, as in they acted like we were lying so since we didn't want to argue anymore we just signed for the kids. It took the front desk a day to tell us that they couldn't do anything as the owner of the Cafe is different from the owner of the hotel and they have their own rules. Huh??? Different policy for the Hotel Cafe??? So go figure haha. Anyway, the simple bfast was okay and filling even if it was the same the whole 6 days we were there - the breads were really good specially the mini chocolate Danish. Apart from the breakfast ""misunderstanding"", our stay at the hotel was good. The rooms were clean and we really liked the bathroom - others reviewers were right, the bathroom took up maybe 1/3 of the room so it was really comfortable. Rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The washroom at the lobby was even nicer than the one in the room - it was fully automatic in the same way as toilets in Japan but as you open the door, the toilet seat goes up. In the guest area downstairs there are also 2 computers with printer for the guests, as well as brochures and other tour pamphlets in English. You can also borrow umbrellas from the front desk.Behind the hotel is a shop which sells Yoga gear (I can't remember the name) and their bags are really nice. There was a Family Mart around the corner and a big drugstore that closes late and some vendo machines scattered around the hotel. You won't get hungry in that area, there are so many restaurants surrounding the hotel, like at least 2 per street (there's Japanese, Italian, Ramen, steak etc). There's a McDonald's 2 blocks away below Mercure Hotel, a Starbucks a few minutes from Solaria, a Lawson plus the Ramen restaurant right in front of the hotel. There are also 3 department stores in Ginza, we ate twice at Mitsukoshi, both at Japanese restaurants and both were really good. You can walk to all the shops in Ginza, everything is there. Aside from all the luxury brands and chain brands, there's a big music store - Yamaha near Zara and H&M. I think it has 12 floors and it had everything, guitars, straps, all sizes of amplifiers, music books. We only reached until the 3rd floor and we were there for more than 2 hours already. There's a money changer in Ginza at a building called Ginza Core, I think it's World Currency on the 5th floor of that bldg. Also, in case you need extra luggage and don't want to spend on expensive ones, they sell hard case luggage on the ground floor for only ¥5400, 3 sizes and different colors for the same price. Still on the ground floor, there's a store - Zoff - that's sells eyeglasses and sunglasses without or with prescription which you can claim 30 minutes to an hour after they check your eyes. The cheapest pairs, if I remember right, are sold for ¥7000 which includes prescription. They also make those with progressive ones but it will take more than a day. Tsukiji Market is also near the hotel, some family members walked there to eat and it took them 10 minutes. It's also just 1 station away from Ginza. Kabukiza Theatre is also just a little further down the street, with coffee shops on the ground floor while waiting for the show to start.

If you arrive Tokyo through the Haneda airport, you can reach the Higashi Ginza station (Keikyu line --> Asakusa line). However, remember to check the direct train timetable and also get out from A1 exit (with elevator) if u get a big luggage and u just need to cross the road. When u head to the airport, just go to the Exit 3 (again with elevator)We arrived on the first nite at around 11pm from Haneda, the manager came out and told us the non-smoking premier twin room we booked (confirmed on the internet) were not available and offered us the smoking room at a discount (40000 yen discount for 4 nite stay pretty good deal). Else they offered us the non-smoking standard twin room also at a discount. In the end we took the smoking room. Although we were glad we got a discounted price with the same size of room, this kind of over booking is hard to understand as the room availability should be accurately monitored over the internet. I seldom encountered such cases in any other hotels in the world, not to mention about Japan. Anyway...The room was smaller than expected as the room size is said to be 34 sq. m. The bathroom was out of proportion large with a nice built in TV screen in the bath area (well personally i prefer the screen to be in the toilet section as one can hardly hear the TV when taking a shower) The make up area has two washing basins which is really a luxury. In-room amenities are also good with high quality. I especially like their shampoo and shower gel.The beds are relatively big by Tokyo twin room standard, both pillows and blankets are comfortable. However, with this room size, one can still hardly find space to put the luggages for two persons as some space is also wasted for the big door entrance area. Another minus is the lighting. Very dim indeed and also very hard to understand the switches for which one is for which. In house wifi is a bit on the slow side but acceptable.At night, sometimes you can hear some noise from the street (sirens or something) but this is kind of expected as it's in central Ginza. The restaurant inside the hotel seems very nice but we never tried. Reception area is small but staff in general helpful. There is also a courier service offered. However the hotel does NOT offer service to book restaurants in advance as they do not have a dedicate concierge service.We stayed in this hotel twice in this trip and the second time of stay we chose the standard twin room. Size is not a big difference except the bathroom is much much smaller. I would choose the premier though if you get a good deal as the standard room is really very small but normal in tokyo standard especially for central Ginza.","Hong Kong, China","Harmomimi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",54,4.0

After spying some double rooms in our corridor, I was pleased to find these review comments were true - the twin rooms were almost double the size. We pushed the beds together, moved a table out of the way and all in all, it made for a perfect (if not a little compact) sized room for our 7 day break.On check in, we were given a pamper pack of toiletries - the service was quick and faultless. The front desk staff all spoke excellent English and recommended some great local spots for a late dinner. We were up on the 13th Floor - and I was impressed with how clean and well laid out the rooms were. The bathrooms comprised of a wonderful 'Japanese' style toilet (with all the gadgets) a basin area and then a separate wet room with a bath and shower. The TV had plenty of channels but only 2 english channels - both news. Not a problem for us as we were out every day, all day.The location is absolutely perfect for not only venturing around Ginza but hopping on the Ginza Subway line which connects to Tokyo Station and many other major subway lines around Tokyo. However, most mornings we took the leisurely 20 minute walk to Tokyo Station to hop on the main circular Yamanote Line which pretty much stops at all the 'main places' you will likely want to go in Tokyo. The hotel itself is one block back from the main Ginza street which becomes pedestrianized on a Saturday - many of the streets lining the hotel are quaint, tree lined avenues dotted with impressive fashion stores and restaurants.  Across the street and a little way down is a Starbucks - which we would stop off at each morning as things in Tokyo really don't get going until after 10AM. We also found the 11th and 12th floor restaurants in the nearby Mitsukoshi Ginza department store to be a really great choice for lunch (The Okonomiyaki and Tonkatsu places were outstanding!). A highly recommended 'To Do' in the vicinity would to head to Tsjuki Fish Market - we walked from the hotel (around 20 mins) and spent a good few hours taking in all of the weird and wonderful sights. It truly is a sight you have to see.All in all, a great base in an ideal location in the heart of Tokyo! After seeing all over Tokyo in the 7 days we were there, I was really pleased we had chosen the upmarket and lovely Ginza as our base.

You can relax and chill and yet not be so far from the action.Solaria is directly in front of Ippudo for some great ramen and gyoza, and a couple of steps away from Ikinari, awesome steak by the gram, and very great value. Family Mart convenience store, Starbucks, McDonalds, St. Marc Cafe are also all just within a minute or two away. To and from the airport is also very convenient via train as the Higashi-Ginza exit is also just 2 minutes away. If you have luggage, suggest you take the A1/A2 exit as these have elevators and are very close to the hotel. Several subway exits also nearby to take you all around Tokyo. Shopping also close by as giant chains such as Bic Camera, Muji, Mitsukoshi, Itoya, Tokyu Hands, Matsuya Ginza, Apple Store, Don Quixote, Uniglo, are all within 5-10 minutes away.

After searching through the reviews of Tokyo hotels, I chose this one for us. I must say that the reviews were correct, this hotel was a wonderful find! We went to the hotel early, hoping to check in and leave our bags to go explore, but we were told we had to come back after 3:00 PM. This was not an issue since the reservation made this clear. However, I did have to be a bit persistent in asking them to check our luggage so we could go out and explore. The person who I spoke with wasn't fluent in English, so I had to use a translator app on my cell phone to communicate. When we returned that evening, we checked in and were amazed at the level of security the hotel had. The elevator will not allow you to select a floor, but you have to touch your key against a sensor in the elevator and it lights up your floor for you. The rooms were fully stocked with everything you need; shampoo, conditioner, liquid soap, slippers for the room and another pair for the bathroom, pajamas and more! The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We felt very welcome and the housekeeping staff couldn't do enough to help you. Checkout was also very easy, they called us a taxi to take us to Tokyo Station to catch our train to the airport. What I liked most about this hotel was the great security, free WiFi and a staff that is eager to please! When I had WiFi issues an employee brought an Ethernet Adapter to my room and set it up. This gave me my own little hotspot and wonderful speeds!

The system to make yourself a fresh cup of coffee is pretty ingenious and the ground coffee was of good quality.The breakfast had two hot items which alternated and the other items were the same every day.Quality of the food was excellent, service fast and staff friendly. We enjoyed the breakfast, but think that guests that stay longer might want some variation.Frontdesk staff is polite and quite a few spoke English well. Some days we were greeted when we entered, some days we were not. Location is excellent with a short walk to the subway and to shops and restaurants.

That being said, the bath and shower is really well built and quite large. The shower does not have to be stepped up into like a tub which makes it great for those with physical limitations. The room comes with a safe, fridge, and pants press. The closet is large enough to accommodate two people comfortably, unlike other hotels in Japan.

Wifi kept kicking us off randomly for no apparent reason. Beds were somewhat hard but surprisingly comfortable anyway. The A/C settings were all in Japanese but when we figured it out it all worked fine.Location:Near to both JR and the metro. There are many restaurants and shops near by; if you want Kobe Beef I can recommend Gyu-An.Most of the shopping around the hotel was high-end and basically all the same stuff we can get at home (cheaper) anyway, so on our next trip we would not pick the Ginza area. We ended up doing most of our purchases in Akihabara, Ueno and Shinjuku, where we found less ""fancy"" stores that were more to our taste.Family Mart right across the street, but you might want to walk to the Hanamasa to get your food items and drinks way cheaper. The Access Narita bus (http://accessnarita.jp/en/home/) was very cheap and easy way to get to the hotel.Breakfast:Almost the EXACT same breakfast every day. The only difference was the rice dish of the day (hot). Very limited ""western"" options, and mostly cold food only (various salads). The restaurants is pretty small but we managed to avoid any waiting.After a few days we regretted paying for the breakfast at all (on top of the already very pricy room rate). I would say the breakfast was the most disappointing part of our stay.In summary: It was alright, but you can probably get something similar at a lower price if you pick one of the other areas of Tokyo (Shinjuku, Shibuya) instead.Tip: Get a b-mobile visitor SIM card for your phone. Getting around was so much easier using Google Maps, which can also give you metro routes and prices.","Stockholm, Sweden","elqueffo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",20,3.0

It was well located being close to a few train stations that gave you easy access to different lines. There is a direct train from Haneda Airport which stops at the Higashiginza station. The train journey took roughly 40 minutes. Do be careful of which train to board from the airport though. Not all the trains would stop at Higashiginza Station. There is a disable lift at the station that was great for us with suitcases and a stroller. The hotel is only five minutes walking away. The twin room we stayed at was small, although not small by Tokyo standards. The room was well designed with even a sofa. The bathroom was spacious. Furnishing was all new. Sound proofing for the rooms seemed to be good which was great for us with a toddler. Staff was friendly and gave excellent service. One gentleman helped us to call a metro station to retrieve our lost bags left on a metro train. The neighbourhood was quiet and felt very safe. Plenty of dining options were available to us. We were able to walk to the Fish Market, the shopping district and Tokyo Station didn't seem too far away too if you don't mind a long stroll. In summary, we really enjoyed the four day stay at the hotel and would highly recommend it to family and friends.

You are within a 5 minute walk to the heart of Ginza. You are also a couple of minutes away from the Ginza subway station and a 5 minute walk from the Narita Access bus stop (more on this later). There is a Starbucks a minute or two away, which was very handy for breakfast as we did not opt for the hotel breakfast.Getting here: If you are taking the subway from anywhere, get off at Ginza and follow the signs for exit A12. When you get to street level, walk left. You will see a Starbucks and shortly after will see the hotel's sign on top of the building.From the airport, opt for the Access Narita option (http://accessnarita.jp/en/home/). It's 1000 yen per person each way. The bus stop is located right when you walk outside the terminal (there are 2 stops at either end, so walk left or right when you walk out of the airport to get to stop A2 or A19. Plenty of luggage room on the bus. The bus will drop you right by the main intersection at Ginza. When you get off the bus, turn to face the road, look left and you will see a store sign for ""Paradise Dynasty"". Walk straight down that street and you will reach the hotel.Room: Room were nice and clean. We stayed in a Double Room and found that sufficient for 2 people. A little small by North American standards but that is to be expected. Food: Plenty of options nearby, but I will focus on Halal food as those are usually harder to find for those with dietary restrictions. There are 2 restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. We tried both, 1 Malaysian (Rasa Malaysia) and 1 Indian (Annam Restaurant). Both were a little on the pricier side but that is to be expected given the location. These can be a little tricky to find. When you get to the main Ginza intersection, walk on the main street with the Sapporo building on the left and Ricoh building on the right, Walk on the left side. When you see Mizuho bank, take a left on that street. The second or third building has both restaurants and has an ""Asics"" sign on the top. There are small signs for the restaurant on the building as well.Overall: We had a great stay at the hotel and would definitely recommend. The staff was helpful, although English seemed a little limited. However, the lady was definitely making an effort to be very clear and I thoroughly appreciated it.","Pickering, Canada","hrizvi86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pickering, Canada</strong>",47,5.0

They gave us two twin rooms next to each other exactly per our request and on non-smoking floors, not all small Tokyo hotels accommodate us like this before.The hotel is really in a great Ginza location, 2 short blocks from Matsuya Department store and very near Mitsukoshi, both have marvelous food floors. It is near Ginza and Higashi-Ginza metro stations where you can easily take a ride to many other sites like Asakusa & Omotesando. Tokyo station is a short taxi ride away -so convenient for those who take Narita Express from the airport, perhaps about 20 min walk. Yurakucho train station & Tsukiji Fish market is about 10 min walk in the opposite direction. There is a FamilyMart and a Starbucks you can see from the lobby.In all, it is a great small hotel, truly a gem and at a very reasonable price for Ginza. Our family have visited Tokyo many times before and tried many hotels, Solaria is the one we will come back to the next time. Our special thanks to Hatano San at the reception who kindly helped getting the laptop we forgot on the plane and for arranging our airport transportation.",Thailand,"ChiaraJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Thailand</strong>",56,5.0

We had one night in Tokyo and wanted a base close to Tokyo station and some good restaurants etc. Solaria was the perfect option. Located just off of the main shopping street in Ginza, not far from transport links, Shinkansen and metro etc. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful with excellent restaurant recommendations etc.Room is very small but it seems most are in the Far East. Perfectly formed, big bed, small desk area and small bathroom. The Japanese toilets are incredible. Enjoy!Breakfast was very tasty. Buffet style. Lots on offer from cereals and toasts to steamed dumplings and sashimi. Restaurant is really nicely decorated. One small gripe I have was on arrival. We had flown for 12 hours through the night, spent 2 hours getting from Narita airport, and we were told our room was ready but we would have to pay extra to get in to it early. When you are already paying for a full day and you've clearly traveled a long way I can not see why they can't just let you in to the room. Seems a little tight. That aside, we would definitely stay at Solaria again. Ginza is great for shopping and a few minutes by taxi from Tokyo station. Also, a good walk to the fish market which is worth a look.

You can open these windows a bit but you then see the reason. The next building is only a cars width away and there is a sturdy fire escape just outside your window. So they are protecting your privacy. I was there for nearly a week and this did begin to grate on me but if you are staying just a night or two really isn't an issue.Breakfast at 2100? yen (£15) was a good buffet with a leaning to anti-pasti.

It is about two or three blocks from the main Ginza shopping and dining area. When I stayed here, the hotel was roughly 1.5 years old but still looked new and kept in excellent condition. I couldn't book through their website, so I used a third party booking site. Arrived at the hotel with no problems. Rate was about 14,000 yens a night for a twin bed room which roughly translates to about $ 150 USD, which is considered a bargain since Ginza's hotel rates can be quite expensive. Room was spacious enough and comfortable. The bathroom blew my mind away as it was larger than what I've seen in other hotels in most of Asia. The shower and bathtub are in the same space but there is a door that separates it from the sink and toilet. The door can actually close all the way and you'll feel it to be secured. My only complaint about the shower was the water temperature has a tendency to change suddenly from hot to scalding hot and back to hot for no reason. The shower lever, which controls the water temperature is independent of the on and off lever which is convenient so you can always have your specific water temperature preference (in Celsius). The hotel will provide a router for you to plug in and use the internet, which is free of charge. The hotel provides two free daily bottles of water. Didn't try the restaurant on-site. Staff spoke decent English and were helpful with getting around the area. There are two Family Marts (convenience store) in the vicinity of the hotel. One directly across the street and another across from this Family Mart. I had no other complaints for this hotel and found it to be in an ideal location. I highly recommend this hotel to my friends and family, and would stay here again when I return to Tokyo.The Ginza station is just around the corner of the hotel; the JR station (Yurakucho Station) is a 10 minute walk away. Other attractions such as the Tsukiji Fish Market is also a short walk away.","Los Angeles, California","Brian90212</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",78,5.0

(There is a direct train from Haneda Airport to Higashi Ginza. The one-way ticket is JY550, and it's a 27-minute train ride. To get to Haneda, we took the airport limousine bus at the nearby Marriott Courtyard Hotel. We didn't have too much luggage. So we walked there and it took us about 8 minutes.
