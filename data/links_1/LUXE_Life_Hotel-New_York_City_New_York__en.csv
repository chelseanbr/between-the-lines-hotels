Our room was clean, quiet and a very comfortable bed. I didn’t hear one city street noise at all. The only downside is if you’re lookin for a room with a view or even lookout, this is not it. But we didn’t mind as we were out all day in the city. It was nice to have a quiet, darker room. The bathroom is pretty nice, but small. But, things in NY tend to be that way. Again, cannot say enough about how comfortable the bed was. This spot was a great location as well. It’s so close to Herald Square and perfect midtown location. We scored free parking (on weekend) on the same street just a few blocks down. For the price, location and overall enjoyment, this is one of the places to stay. Also, with the resort fee, they give you Voss water bottles each day. Very pleased with accommodations and communication with the staff.",,Leftmyheartinthecity,0,4.0

The positives of this hotel is of course the price, very affordable. The bed is definitely comfortable as well and the bathrooms are larger than one would expect in NY. The bed is what would lead us to return again if ever necessary. When we went, there was also a free breakfast provided which is definitely a plus. They provided croissants, fresh fruit, coffee and juices. On the second floor is a small gym and a little area for coffee and tea whenever you like as well as a computer and printer. The negatives include the front desk customer service which is lacking. I am not confident that they are trained adequately to provide the best service as check in was lack luster. A call to the front desk started with “What?” which left me quite shocked that some time has passed before I responded. The hotel itself is also rather dark, there are only 2 elevators that are quite small. The hallways themselves are also small and especially if you are on the top floors. The room’s decor is played up in the website’s pictures but walking in was somewhat disappointing. I understand that they have an aesthetic they are trying to do but the execution just made the room look dirty (ie. The “vintage” looking mirrors and side tables). Another reviewer from before mentioned the floors looking dirty which I quite agree but it is only due to the style of the flooring. A rug in some areas could ameliorate this. It was not comfortable walking on those floors without slippers (which they didn’t have). The balcony offering was also quite odd but that is a room we got and it did have a nice view- if you look up. The furniture placed outside just seemed like an after thought. Overall it was an average stay that could use improvements in order to enhance guest experience. This hotel has a lot of potential that they have yet to tap into.

The rooms are «cold», with old concrete floors, which are indeed beautiful, yet not very comfortable with bare feet, and the room is is in general very minimalistic. The AC is bad.... you know, one of these noisy boxes high on the wall with a remote control. Such a place would have deserved a centralised, quiet ventilation system. My room was otherwise small, but that don’t bother me at all. The best part was the bathroom, which was nicely decorated in an classic, «old NYC» way (yet entirely new).There is big potential to improve the reception; I learned that the lobby restaurant and bar had gone bankurupt recently, and the entire lobby therefore looks exactly like that; a place which has been closed down, with chairs on the tables and a not so good atmosphere.Also the corridors are a bit strange; by original design they are narrow, but the 2017 designer hasn’t done a good job with the color- and light design....and the service in the reception could have been better. When we asked for a late check out, the answer was «yes, I can do noon». That’s not a late check out.... And the receptionist spent much more time calling the baggage man / janitor(?), than it would take for him to move our suitcases the 2 m(!!) into the baggage room. But when and if the bar and restaurant is up and running again, and if they do something about the gloomy corridors and the messy lobby (and put a nice rug og the floors in the rooms) this place will improve much, and I might come back :-)","Bergen, Norway","Jarle H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bergen, Norway</strong>",31,3.0

There’s also a massive and very noisy box on wall air-condition system. One amenity I’m not so happy to see. There’s no room service, now this just drives me mad, staying in a hotel on your own for work this is really important. All you can get in this entire hotel is a small bottle of water in your room, that’s it, no breakfast in the morning. Nothing. Surely it should mention this somewhere in the booking information, it’s a common necessity people take for granted as being included at this price point, so if it’s not, it needed to be SPELT OUT IN CAPS. I feel completely ripped off and like I’m staying in the hotel from The Shining. I’ve stayed in a new hotels for the same price close to this (The James) that was everything this hotel is not.

Being a New Yorker all my life, I have never seen the appeal with staying in a hotel in or very near Times Square. The noise and the crowds are just too much for me. But I get it: some people who come to visit NYC see Times Square as the center of it all and to a degree it’s true. There are better areas in Manhattan to stay and where Life Hotel is located is one of them. Depending on who you ask, the neighborhood is Chelsea north, midtown south or even Koreatown. It doesn’t matter. It’s a great neighborhood. Quiet enough so you can get a good night’s rest but so close to anything you want to see either by walking or mass transit. I must say that the hotel’s signage and outside appearance do not standout. It’s not ugly or anything but it certainly doesn’t call much attention to itself. During my first stay, I walked right past the main entrance because I thought it was the entrance to the restaurant (recently closed as of this writing). The entrance area (for lack of a better word. There is no lobby in the classic sense) is problematic. You basically enter into what was once the restaurant’s space. The small reception area is in the rear left. You could easily miss it. Signage is not very prominent. The space is also dimly lit and the ceilings low. It’s got nothing style wise. Not drab. Just very unmemorable. Check in was fine. Staff were efficient and nice and handled my reservation well. First time I stayed on an upper floor (I think it’s only like 10 floors). Second time was on the 5th floor.Elevators are slow and small which is common in older buildings like this one. One is located near the reception area. The other is near a stairway. The stairway is actually rather nice so if you’re on the 2nd or 3rd floors, I’d suggest using them. Hallways also have zero style and are narrow. Like the other common areas of the hotel, there’s nothing horrible about them. It’s just that they don’t prepare you at all for what you get when you see YOUR ROOM.Ok. Now the great Stuff. The ROOM. The BED. What a surprise. So this is where the designers/developers put their money and they put it to good use. First time I stayed in a room in the back of the hotel it was big. Big high ceilings. Big bathroom. Big TV. And best of all, BIG brass bed. King size. Super comfortable. Did one person like me need a king size brass bed? No. Did one person like me like a king size brass bed? Oh Yes. The rooms are truly beautiful. All white including the bathrooms. Tastefully though minimally decorated which made the rooms feel even bigger. The floors were restored hardwood and in the room I stayed in during my second stay, there was a section that was (I think) concrete that was obviously part of the original building that lent an air of authenticity to the space that I really appreciated. It was bright, charming, peaceful and oh so comfortable. I really got a good night’s rest in those beds. Rooms came with the basic things you want and/or expect: toiletries, safe, iron plus one plush bathrobe that I liked. Everything was immaculate. I cannot say enough about these rooms and especially the beds. If you’re looking for a hotel with amenities like you’d find at a Hilton Garden Inn or the like, you’re not going to find them at the Life Hotel. It’s a special place and may not appeal to everyone. It excelled where I think it’s most important: the room. Five Stars for that.","New York City, New York","CWConnolly0100</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",4,5.0

Not easy to do in June or July. Life hotel popped up as an option and the price was right. So we took it. It’s a small building with a lot of history renovated many times but this current level of renovation provides clean But small rooms, and comfort for a night or two.Staff were lovely, and the elevator system is old and has a real feeling to it. A little research on the building shows that it used to be headquarters for at least a major component of time life. A small card that I have attached here shows a little bit of history. On the lobby level when you enter off the street there’s a bar and restaurant right in front of you. The reception is a little further in. We had dinner at the restaurant the first night. It is a nice Caribbean fusion type of restaurant but music was quite loud. Nevertheless this is New York.The hotel is also within walking distance to Penn Station, and the Herald Square Metro stop which is very convenient for getting around to most of New York City.Compared to some of the larger hotels in the vicinity, I would say this is a good deal.","Tel Aviv, Israel","mysterioustraveling</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tel Aviv, Israel</strong>",121,4.0

Or how about a General Manager (Ferran Sanfelimon) who doesn't know how to run a property? Then you should stay here and pay extra for crap service.I stayed for 6 nights. My first moment on property I had to carry my bags up the stairs into the lobby as there were no bellman around, no one to open the door and a front desk manager who couldn't be asked to greet me or look up from her computer until I said ""Umm hello?"" and then she finally looked up and said ""I'll be with you in a moment"". Not friendly at all, just attitude. NOT a good first impression. Also, they don't move people away from the front of the hotel to smoke (no one wants to enforce this or ask people to move a little away from the café), so you get to inhale cigarettes when you're sitting in the café even with the doors and windows closed since it's directly under the café window that people stand and smoke.2nd experience was in my bathroom - as soon as I got in the room I washed my hands and the water stayed in the sink not going down. I thought it was just an old hotel quirk so I ignored it and washed my hands again later and it got worse. The sink started to back up. So I pulled on the drain and took out the drain stopper and the most disgusting putrid smelling clump of hair that looked like a giant chia pet was clinging to the drain. I literally gagged at the smell of it and (should have taken a photo of that), called the housekeeper in to see this. She walked in the bathroom and said ""OH MY GOD what is that?"" And then apologized profusely and said ""this isn't my room to clean the other cleans it"". However, this had not been cleaned in years. For sure - there is no way someone cleaned that drain recently which is a testimony to how well management checks on the different departments. Vile! 3rd incident: I watched the same engineer (essentially a janitor type guy) sit on the couch on my 9th floor room and watch movies on his phone for at least 30 minutes every day. I snapped a photo since I thought it was poor management to allow this to go on (when doesn't a GM walk the floors?? Apparently when you're Ferran Sanfelimon and you hid in your office.) When I told the General Manager about it he acted suprised and asked to see the photo. I sent it to him and shared some feedback about my stay. Since it was a business trip and I was looking for a convenient hotel which I could return to again and again since I own my own company and travel, I thought it would be good to have a relationship with a hotel that I know, so I was feeling this one out. Sanfelimon offered me two breakfasts to compensate for any issues I had - really not a good tradeoff (there were others but I don't want to tire out my fingers typing that much). I accepted one breakfast but the service was awful. The waitress forgot to bring food we ordered, so even though we asked twice she said ""the chef needs to get the avocadoes so it's going to take a few minutes"". Really, and how long does it take to cut an avocado? So we finished our meal and got up to ask for the check (she never came back and was talking with another server -btw there was no one else in the restaurant), and they were looking at something on a phone which was way more important than doing her job). She met us as we walked towards her and gave some flippant reason ""the chef has an event to do today and couldn't get the avocadoes"". And she couldn't come to the table and tell us? And bring the other thing we ordered? Ridiculous. Who trains this hotel staff? We gave her the card for a free breakfast and left. I emailed the GM again and said I didn't want to eat at the restaurant, and that I felt I had been more than understanding about the quirks so far and that I thought what would be fair was to offer to take one night off of my bill. He didn't respond. Surprised? Nahhh. So i emailed again when I returned home - just in case he was soooo busy he couldn't answer my email, but he stil didn't bother to respond. So just for one last hurrah, I tried again and it was ignored. This let me know that my business was not valued and so I am leaving this very honest review. I would never recommend this hotel or stay here again. Service was crap and the GM is terrible at his job and managing this staff who clearly hate their jobs.","Los Angeles, California","GirlGoneMild</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",13,1.0

My wife and I have been to NYC 3 times now and stayed in 3 hotels and a BnB. We understand that only the top hotels in NYC will be totally amazing but then you'll have to pay for the experience to stay in these. So please take this into account when staying in NYC whether it's here or somewhere else.Pros: Bright hotel room decor, lovely original fixtures entwined with some modern pictures and hall furniture, very good restaurant, bar and cocktail basement bar that's always lively but never too loud, rooms kept clean daily as is the halls, rooms have very comfy beds and air con/heater (typical NY style window unit), satellite tv in rooms, free drinks station on the 2nd floor serving coffee, tea and hot chocolate and reasonably well equipped gym on the 2nd floor open 24 hrs a day.We found the staff there to be very friendly and very helpful when asking for info and help despite other peoples reviews. Also I don't think the rooms are that small as people make out to be. Again, consider that this is a Manhattan hotel, the price of the rooms and that it is not a major chain or top 5 star hotel. If you want a big room it's like anything else, you pay for what you get.The hotel is very conveniently located for taking in NYC if you are new to the city. The nearest subway is Herald Square and you can get to anywhere in the city virtually from there.The restaurant and bar in the lobby was always busy but never intrusive. I've read good things about the restaurant and although not eating there, the food looked amazing when we passed through the lobby. There was alway soul and RnB music playing but never at loud volume.Cons:Needs a literature book supplied in the rooms to inform of amenities available. For example was told guests can use cast videos and films from smartphone/tablets to tv's in the room but no matter what I tried I could not get it to work, desk lamps have usb sockets to charge devices. If known upfront, would not bring a separate charger, in general other services were not explained or made known unless we asked for them. Also noted in other reviews is that the halls are dimly lit. However I noticed the room doors are not completely sealed and would let light into the room. But this never bothered my wife or me whatsoever.Another cool feature was the metal room doors and the magnets for the do not disturb signs. Cool and quirky.One thing we were not sure of (and we could be wrong) but my wife either read or heard that a free cocktail or drink was included with the stay but this was not mentioned or shown.On the whole we were very pleased with the standard set on our stay but a few little minor things would elevate the hotel.1: Literature books in the rooms2: Maybe an addition of free continental breakfast to accompany the free coffeeWould happily recommend this hotel for a 3,5 or 7 night stay for exploring the city.","Finmere, United Kingdom","Wayne R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Finmere, United Kingdom</strong>",3,4.0

Everything was spotless. I actually booked 3 other rooms for coworkers (we were on a business trip), all of whom liked their rooms as well.Entering the hotel is interesting - you walk through a busy, vibrant bar/restaurant area to get to the little registration desk. There are two interestingly-designed elevators to take you up to your room (rounded back wall, old-timey floor indicators). The layout of the floors is unusual - it's not obvious where the rooms are, but you'll find them with a little exploration.The TV system is fantastic. I'm not a video junkie, but the menu system is pretty cool. The hot water is very, very hot - be careful. One thing I really liked is that all the lights are on dimmer switches. A very nice touch.The breakfast was very light - coffee (and probably tea, we didn't ask for it), a choice of a couple of types of croissant, a fruit cup, a coffee cake, a yogurt parfait, and a hard boiled egg cup.

Very comfortable beds, plenty of good towels, friendly helpful staff, fair rates for midtown, close to transportation. The bare floors in our room had not been vacuumed and we kept picking up bits of floor material on bare feet. The bathroom supplies and water bottles were not replenished for our 2nd night. The bathroom is adequate but TINY and on the 2nd day the extractor fan stopped working, so the mirrors were entirely steamed up and there was condensation on the tile floor. The hot water - boiling hot, and a good powerful shower - took almost 3 minutes to get from wherever the boiler is to the shower and sink. Free luggage storage before and after checking in/out, very convenient. Sad to report that the toilet was not cleaned after our first night's stay, very disappointing when the service was otherwise decent.

Things got off to a shaky start with us being asked to move out of the way as we checked in. This was in case any of the restaurantguests wanted to get past in order to use the toilets. (We were spending nearly $3000.00 here and I wasn’t overly impressed with the attitude of this member of staff). Check in was otherwise uneventful and we set off upstairs to check out the rooms. We had a double Queen and a single queen room. Both rooms were big enough for our needs with super comfy beds and large screen TVs. The rooms were clean and comfortable. There was no carpet in the single queen room which we thought was a bit odd - just a painted concrete floor. It doesn’t feel very clean to walk on and if I owned the hotel it would be the first thing I would do. We found the staff to be generally on the surly side which surprised us as they are widely praised on here. The lady that checked us out was definitely the exception as she was lovely. When we checked in we were given vouchers for free cocktails in with our room keys to welcome us, however, we weren’t told that they were there and didn’t find them until the day we were checking out. My personal feeling is that a welcome gesture like this really can set the tone for an entire stay so to not tell guests that the vouchers are there is massively missing a trick. The lovely lady on Reception explained that we could still use them after check out and saved the day again!Our experience here overall was very positive but more because of the hotel and its superb location rather than the staff. We cant comment on food here as we didn’t eat here - again, if the staff gave a more welcoming vibe then we may have chosen to do so. The coffee machine on the second floor is fine - hot chocolate was very good. There is a small gym which looked decent enough. They were accommodating with looking after our suitcases after checkout while we went shopping and we had our welcome cocktails before we left.

I stayed for 4 nights during a business trip. The location is great - super central; close to several subway lines and easy to walk to many things both uptown and downtown. The font desk and staff in general were lovely - so friendly and wanting to help. That's where the fun stops. The room itself is minuscule and very poorly designed. I asked to moved to a larger room, and they did help me do so on my second night, but the ""upgrade"" was negligible - hardly worth the trouble. The issue is that the designer made poor furniture choices of shoving giant king size beds inside a small space, and in my ""bigger"" room, they decided to add a couch at the foot of the bed. So where there was finally a few extra feet of space, it was a waste to put additional furniture there! Fine linens and a big bed don't make up for a room you can barely walk in. The bed takes up the ENTIRE room, and I'm not exaggerating. My suite case sat in front of the door which has a few inches of space between it and the bed, and when I had to go out, I'd put it in the bathroom! The bathroom has ZERO counter space. For real - ZERO. They have a cheap mesh staking shelf under the sink that you can use to hold toiletries, but who wants to put their toothbrush on a bathroom floor - even if it is on a baby shelf - that's gross. The heater/AC unit is a window unit that is SOOOO loud, I chose to turn it off to sleep and froze to death. Luckily there was a Nordstrom Rack nearby where I bought sweats and socks to sleep in. The closet holds about 3 outfits. If you are there for more than a couple of nights, definitely don't stay here. Lastly, on top of the window unit, I had a front facing room when they moved me and OMG - the noise was crazy. I didn't sleep a wink! Trucks and people and honking horns, oh my. Plus, you hear everyone in every room that is near you and in the hallways. I also had a room near the elevator which is never fun, but especially loud here. Also, as noted in other reviews - no lobby at all - you walk into a loud restaurant. Overall, it's just not a great design, and it's obvious they worked hard to make it ""hip and cool"", but it misses the mark. For the price, given it's NYC, it's ""okay"", but you can spend a little more (e.g. $50 or so per night) and get an exponentially better hotel.","Los Angeles, California","GlobeRoamer005</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",37,3.0

We couldn’t have loved it more. Yes, it isn’t the quietest hotel in the world but given the location - right around the corner from Penn Station, MSG and the Empire State - you expect that there will be some outside noise. If visiting for touristy reasons, the location will be a huge benefit to you. Subway station a minute round the corner that will take you downtown and the the Lower East side. Open top bus stop essentially at the end of the street. 5 or so avenues up from the port where you can get a New York ferry over to Brooklyn. We stayed in room 602 which was a really good size with plenty of space for cases, a sofa and a huge comfy bed. The rooms are simple and stylish but equipped with all the things I want when staying in a hotel that I don’t expect to be spending a lot of time in (ie. in a place like NYC) such as a great bed, a hot shower and a decent TV. The rooms have all of these things. My only slight wish would have been for tea/coffee making facilities in the room. There is a machine on the second floor though and the coffee from it was actually really nice. I’ve also read some poor comments about customer service but my experience with the front desk was fantastic. We also received a couple of drinks tokens for a free cocktail when we checked in (the bar is excellent - not usually a lover of a Tom Collins but the ones we had were fantastic) Everyone we encountered was lovely and very helpful in terms of advice and directions.

I'm a very heavy sleeper, but even I woke up at least 6 times during the night. It's not the average motor/HVAC noise that's coming from right outside the blocked off window. I felt like I was staying at a car manufacturing factory. It gets very high pitched from 12am - 4am. The worst. 4) The doors are so thin and I was able to hear everyone's conversation in the hallway. 5) There is no lobby. You enter the building, and you're in middle of a restaurant. You go to the very back of it and you see a tiny reception desk. Very loud too. 6) Tiny. Hallways are narrow, elevators are small, the room is tiny. Suffocating overall. And I've been to numerous hotels in NYC so no, this isn't just a NY thing. 7) This hotel is like a poorly flipped house with a 10k budget. Only cosmestic work done. Worst $700 spent on two nights.

Anyway, if you're looking for a central location at a good price in Manhattan, I can heartily recommend this renovated boutique hotel on 31st between 5th and Broadway. It's not a coincidence that it's called Life as the classic glossy magazine was published in this building from the time it was built in 1895 until 1936. There is a classic vintage feel to its architectural elements beginning with the ornate front awning.It was originally designed by the same architects who designed the New York Public Library on 42nd Street. However, the rooms feel quite contemporary with high ceilings, wood floors, and one of the bigger TV screens I've ever seen in a hotel room. For a room with a queen bed, it was $290 per night, a reasonable rate for Midtown. We even took advantage of their second-floor workout room to shave off some of the calories we gathered on our brief vacation in the Big Apple. Alas, as with many period office buildings, the lobby is cramped, but there is a nice long bar (photo) and a stellar new restaurant called Henry.","San Francisco, California","Ed_Uyeshima</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",478,4.0

Lumpy with uncomfortable dips and no spring in the coils. Clearly the mattresses had not been replaced or even flipped over in *some* time. The bed frame was noisy and it woke the other person up when moving or going to the bathroom at night- took 3 showers and all of them were bad. The first 2 showers the water temp would suddenly go from normal to freezing to scalding with no indication which made for a somewhat perilous experience. The last shower I took the temp would not go above tepid/cold lukewarm (at best)- tiny, lone window made for a dark room even though it was white on white decor and our room was on a higher floor- didn't feel like I got my money's worth at $325 a night, even for NYC.

After exploring so much of the city, we all agreed this was the best location.The beds were the most comfortable we’ve ever slept in - all four of us commented on them! Room 1001 was wonderful - large and great natural light and a really nice space for us to retreat after a full day’s walking. Room 811 while comfortable did feel much darker in the day and that is because it was tucked away at the back and had just a small window. The benefit of that was that we slept beautifully - no light or noise to disturb us. All the staff were very friendly and obliging. Housekeeping standards were very high and it was always nice to come back to such clean rooms.The only issues we had were the showers being a bit temperamental with temperature - the staff were quick to address it when we did mention it, but I also see that being an old building, there are probably plumbing issues that are hard to rectify. It wouldn’t put me off staying there again. The restaurant downstairs is very hip and happening - every single night had a crowd and great music.

Even though the neighborhood in Koreatown is a bit charmless, it's just a couple of blocks south to the more on-trend Chelsea and it's restaurants and bars. The hotel is recently renovated, rooms are attractive and comfortable and everything tends to work quite well. We noticed the restaurant and bar downstairs just changed hands and it's fantastic in its current iteration, very elevated multi-cultural cuisine. It gets busy at night with outsiders, and has a nice vibe. Service is exceptional. Breakfast is delicious but very expensive with small portions. I only did it once because of the high prices, and did takeout from Pret-a-Manger on the other two days.

The location was excellent - an easy walk from Penn Station and the whole city very walkable if you choose.We checked in quite late in the evening and while it went smoothly enough it took longer than I would have expected. We arrived in our room ready for a good night's sleep so we could hit the city full on the next day and just as we were settling in, a horrendous noise erupted from a pipe in the room. Apparently this is the heating system/ radiators, is a known issue, and absolutely disturbed our sleep each of the three nights we stayed.Compounding this concern was the fact, though we had been promised an upgrade via email earlier in the week, we did not receive one upon arrival.The first morning I spoke with Monica at the front desk. She was nice enough, and had obviously heard both of my concerns from other customers because though she dealt with my complaint quite professionally, it was obvious from her face this was not the first time this had come up for both issues. She'd promised to look into moving our room for us while we were out that day but by the time I had reached my room five minutes later, called me to tell me no other rooms were available that would provide a different experience. She then asked me to hold so I could speak to the manager, Denise (I think), who is apparently a really nice lady. I wouldn't know because after listening to muzak for six minutes I hung up. No-one called me back.In the end, the room was good enough for our needs. It's not spacious, but we know better than to expect that in NYC. It was clean and quiet enough outside of the heating system. I can't stress enough how loud it is. It actually became quite laughable and we play a video of it for our friends from time to time, who are astonished listening to it.All in all, a hotel with a lot of possibilities, but customer service, misleading emails and in-room solitude were found wanting.","Ottawa, Canada","Dominic T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Canada</strong>",6,3.0

They cleaned the beaux art facade of this former Life Magazine building. And they built out a small handsome restaurant next door and another off the lobby. They did not create a breakfast space - just a coffee machine in the 2nd floor corridor. The beds are super comfy and the bathrooms are stylishly finished in old NYC black and white tiles. But the rooms are small - only good for sleeping. The reception desk can fit in a closet. But we dont stay in hotels to look at facades or reception desks. We want sleep - and that is the problem. The traffic noise on 31st Street goes all night because 1) 2 other westbound streets are closed at 7th avenue - 27th and 31 Sts. And westbound traffic cannot turn from 34th St. So the trucks, the fire engines, and the police cars all take 31st St. They blow their horns, turn on their sirens, and blast their loudspeakers.

The hotel exceeded my expectations. Bed was very comfy and the room was an oasis - as in the photos. My room was long and skinny, it felt huge by NY standards. I needed to work in my room for a few days so this is why I chose the hotel, the room didn't feel cramped when I needed to stay in. I don't think I had any interaction with hotel staff aside from check in and check out, for me this was fine! The bar is a great place to hang out and restaurant looked very nice. I saw how difficult managing a hotel can be when checking out - a woman wearing flip flops was aggressively complaining over lack of light coming in from her window. Really? The buildings are tall, its noisy and its expensive for little space. Why would you come if you weren't expecting these things?The other thing is the great location - steps from Macys (didn't go) and other stores and many food options. I frequented Koreatown to have dinner - the hotel is in the middle of it.One thing I would suggest is stepping up the environmental policy - the usual stuff of giving the option to keep the same towels etc. The water filtration and water bottle was an excellent idea.

For the money -there are no services at all. No door man/bell man -not even an offer to help you up the stairs with luggage. At check in they charge your card for the entire stay upfront- plus $200 in case of incidentals. Soon after I checked and I realized why they charge you upfront so you couldn’t leave without paying. Not sure what incidentals that would be because it’s a cashless hotel and no services. The people at the front desk were rude. Not friendly-and btw I am a NY’er living in another state - so I have a high tolerance for rude. The room was super tiny. Fitting for one person. That’s it. When you shower you heat up your entire place. The first shower I had cold water as well. Not pleasant. I left the air running constantly since you hear everything your neighbor is saying. Several times I had a questions—very simple-whether i was just needing change to tip the cleaning people and each time I was offered “no.” Not remotely helpful and each time I felt like I was bothering them. My second to last day I returned to my room after my meetings at 3 PM and the room had not been cleaned. Someone knocked on my door at 3:30 and asked to clean but I had an event that night and told them they had to come back at five. A few minutes later after I got into the shower someone opened my door and walked in- it was the head of housekeeping saying that 5 o’clock was too late to which I said I’m in the shower - please just leave me some towels. So my room was not cleaned. There are so many wonderful hotels in New York City for the price of this one you’ll be better off staying somewhere else. You would think being so new they’d try harder. The only redeeming part of this stay was they made a good margarita pizza at the bar. Even that was not a friendly experience.

A short walk to 34th Herald St station and Penn Station means you can get to central park end, world trade area, soho, harlem, brooklyn and queens easily. Walk 12 mins to times square, 5 mins to MSG, 12 min subway to Rockafeller plaza, stones throw to Macys and all of the shops, superb location allowing us to move freely around the city. Purchase a 7 day unlimited metro card, this lets you use the subway and buses. Learn what direction your heading in and its easy to navigate, lots of police and train people to help you if you make a wrong turn....mainly from gawping at the sheer height of buildings. Oh and it's about 3 mins to empire state, which you might miss if you're not looking up! All in all a memorable New York break in a fab hotel, would definitely stay again, friendly helpful staff, cleaned daily, free hot drinks, handy complimentary water bottles, filtered water and ice, gym...i could go on and on! Stay here! You won't be disappointed, I just hope they don't increase the prices so that it becomes too exclusive! ",,Michelle L,9,5.0

Upon arriving I was a little unsure as the hotel was smaller than others we have stayed in New York but then that’s its charm. We were not greeted by people to take our luggage and after a long flight I was concerned to what to expect after a very informal relaxed check in. However this again is its charm after a good nights sleep we hit New York and returned to the hotel to be greeted by the same faces who all recognised us and made us feel at home. They interacted with our daughter asked us about our day and could not do enough for us. If you want a hotel with a lovely atmosphere and a great price this is the place. The food in the restaurant is amazing and the cocktails are great. Will definitely go back and have recommended the hotel to lots of people already,,sammydodger2010,2,5.0

There is wood paneling and late 1800 fixtures. The rooms are small, but comfortable. The bathrooms are spacious and have marble finishes. My room had no view, but I am guessing that is common in this part of the city. The ceilings are high and floors are wood. The place has a great deal of charm. Staff is very friendly and helpful.

Life Hotel will definitely be on our list of hotels to return to in the future. The hotel is very new and has a really great vibe to it - young, well kept, good food and fun atmosphere. It is in a renovated office building and they have done a great job in keeping the character of the place (elevator, stairs, landings, etc.) and updating it wonderfully.To begin with, the staff is lovely. The woman who checked us in was fantastic and helped us select a room that we really enjoyed. Upon checkout, we realized that a bad storm was on the way and we needed to cut our trip short by one day. Without any problem, the hotel allowed us to check out early and refunded our last night - really nice!!!!The rooms are brand new and very well designed. The TVs are huge and the furnishings are modern and fun. The bathrooms are well kept and the rainshower heads are fun. I don't think that any rooms have a particular ""view"", but some face the street, which is fun for people watching. The others are nice and quiet.Another nice plus is that in addition to a lovely cafe and bar in the lobby, they offer free coffee/tea/hot chocolate and water refills all the time. They also have a small fitness center, which is quite a bonus for a well-priced boutique hotel in NYC.The neighborhood is also very good.

It was fairly clean, the bed was comfortable, and thought was put into 'landing spots' for the stuff we carry. The room was on the small size but fine for 2 married tourists. My one request (and this goes for most hotels) is they could have used a few more hooks - in bathroom and also near the door. Our room overlooked 31st and while there was street noise, it wasn't terribly noticeable to me (it was to my husband) - especially when we had the wooden shutters closed. The windows could stand to be replaced as their was certainly a draft coming in - and this was February. I didn't mind it as I like fresh air however it's not the best from the standpoint of conserving energy and noise reduction. If you don't care for the things that come with a quirky/historic hotel, I'd book elsewhere. Personally I liked the feel of the room and building. The bar (and restaurant) are part of/off the lobby.

The hotel is right in the middle of the city and basically a short ride or walk away from the best spots. We walked along 5th for the shopping and hit Rock Center/Radio City, swung around to Times Square and Madison Square Garden before finishing off at a nearby spot called The Smith for a drink/bite. Back at the hotel our room was great- the bed like others have commented is super comfortable. After walking most of the day, it was so nice to come back to a great shower, slip into our robes and slippers and melt into our bed. I’m sort of a tech junkie so hello 60 inch TV!! I will say my only minor complaint was wish I had a fridge already in our room. We tested out their text line and literally within 10 min it was delivered, and my leftovers were chilling.  Thumbs up Lifers. So, we really like to eat and drink. We were super excited to try the restaurant (Henry) and we happen to be staying the weekend they opened their downstairs speakeasy cocktail bar. Again, thank god for that bed bc we were in a food and cocktail coma- date night done right.  Just a few of our highlights- we suggest- the baked clams, pig presse and meatball pizza! Skipped dessert and opted for drinks in the speakeasy downstairs, Gibson & Luce. We had the best bartender, French guy named Alex. Definitely ask for him as he won’t steer you wrong. Since it was date night we got this crazy cocktail for 2 – the black chicken (make sure you ask your bartender about the cool story behind it!) came in a flask and brown paper bag.

We loved it and would totally come back again.","Santa Barbara, California","seanrwcrawford</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Santa Barbara, California</strong>",2,5.0
