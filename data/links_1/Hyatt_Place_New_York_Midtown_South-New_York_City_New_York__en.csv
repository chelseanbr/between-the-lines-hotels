Who would book 4 nights in one style of room then change on last night! Clearly they had over booked and required it for a family! Instead of asking nicely, they demanded I hand room back. When I said well give me the other room, all of a sudden they couldn’t check me in until 3pm!!!!! They knew I was leaving at 2.30 it was now 10am! They then said they would charge me to remain in room! So not only did they get use of the free room to re-sell they threw us out! I witnessed people arriving late afternoon being told there rooms were not ready! Why? Because they are happy to charge people to extend but keep you waiting to check in!

Booked the hotel for my 5th wedding anniversary, and was disappointed to learn the hotel was under renovation. That wasn't particularly a problem, but it would have been courteous to inform paying guests prior to arrival, especially given my stay was 8 days.What compounded that, was I learnt all guests received complimentary breakfasts owing to the renovation. I'd already paid for breakfast, so had paid extra for no reason. Furthermore, it meant the breakfast lounge, which is already ridiculously small, was impossible to obtain a seat in. This meant on a few occasions, either hanging around, taking a plate outside, or attempting to get the lift upstairs (5 minute wait), by which point the food was unbearably cold and pointless. So I had paid for breakfast but couldn't get a seat, and people who had complimentary breakfasts were over the moon. One of the managers said this was normal, with a big smile on his face. I was witness to at least 2 other guests absolutely lose it - they had families and were told to load up a tray and take it back upstairs.Lift situation is a joke - 2 lifts and a hotel full of people. We ended up walking up and down 14 flights because we waited over 10 minutes and still couldnt get a lift.The standard of the breakfast was worse than I could have imagined. The eggs were not eggs - they were absolutely some form of powdered variety. The hot options abysmal. Cold options not much better, absolutely loaded with sugar. The manager assured me he would rectify the fact I had paid for breakfast and adjust the rate I paid. He lied. Upon checkout, he had done nothing, and I was left to argue with the reception manager, who also tried to lie to me and insist there was no complementary breakfast - I caught her out and she backtracked. Rooms were fine - relatively clean except for a few dusty spots & dirt behind the sofas and in the corners. No minibar.I was encouraged to sign up to the Hyatt World membership on arrival. Essentially a pointless membership which I will be cancelling. Supposed to be complimentary breakfast included, but as alluded to I'd already purchased breakfast in my package, and they didn't offer to adjust this. The only benefit we received was complimentary water, which we couldn't get for 3 of the 8 days, as the renovations were occurring and the confused people at the desk didn't know how to navigate that massive obstacle of finding a few bottles.",coventry,"isanghera</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>coventry</strong>",0,1.0

We stayed on the 5th floor. Obviously, New York is expensive but I do feel that the price for the room was reasonable (compared to others) given its fantastic location. The subway station is just a 5 minute walk away (although it is the hottest subway station we encountered!). Many of the main sights are also within walking distance including the Empire State Building, Macy's, Madison Square Garden (7-10 minute walk) as well as Times Square, The Rockefeller Centre, Bryant Park, Central Library, Central Station, Chrysler Building (15-20 minute walk) plus much more. However, I would highly recommend getting a 7 day subway pass if you are there for almost a week. It is $33 and really easy to use and you can use it on any of the subway lines, we definitely got value for money and it means you can be a bit lazy if you're feeling tired and just travel one stop without worrying about cost.The room was cleaned daily and we didn't have any issues with the room. It was a very standard room with air-con, a fridge and a king size bed but there is so much to see in NY you won't spend much time in your room. Even when we were tired on some afternoons we would take our own drinks up to the roof terrace and relax up there, it is a really nice space with great views of the Empire State Building. The only reason I didn't give the hotel 5 stars was because of breakfast. We found that there were often not enough staff on at breakfast so tables wouldn't be cleaned very fast and the food wasn't always topped up if it had ran out so you ended up missing out. We would often have to sit at a table covered in crumbs or with dirty plates and bowls still on them with no sign of a member of staff ready to clean them. My other issue about breakfast is that it is only served until 9am downstairs which seems really early, I know it is served on the terrace until 10am but sometimes it was too windy to sit on the terrace, we did this once and everything was blowing everywhere. The food served at breakfast is nice and we never had any problems with the food itself, there is a choice of hot food, toast, bagels, doughnuts, yoghurt and lots of nice fresh fruit as well as juices and hot drinks.The lobby area is currently under construction but this didn't impact us on our trip.I would stay here again because of the location but I hope breakfast time is improved.",,Amy F,22,4.0

Full stop. The thing is, our expectations aren’t high being used to London and it’s outlandish price/quality ratio. But the Hyatt Place Mid-town appears to defy the odds. We have been in touch with the hotel via Twitter (DM) but that didn’t trouble the hotel as no one approached us to discuss. So what’s the snag? Essentially, the breakfast room setup is worst what we have seen and we travel a lot both on business and privately. For disclosure, I lived in a Hyatt hotel for three month and no issues. So (a) I believe I have been loyal to Hyatt and (b) with a family one does take convenience discounts into account (although should one, really?). Regardless, the breakfast room is too small/narrow and overall not fit for purpose. We could barely move (chairs back to back and no room to pass! - see picture) and as family of five could not sit together, once. On one day, we had to split up into three tables. Given the inadequate space, it brings the worst out in people with unfortunate scenes at the buffet bar. Equally, no staff appears to be present to clear away plates and it became all a bit of youth hostel feel to it all. Despite having Explorist Status no offer of room upgrade, nor any service offer that generally comes with Hyatt frequent user status.

April 2019 . 2 adults and 2 kids , aged 7 and 10 . We had a room on the 5th floor , good size room , loads of space for New York Standards , had a big double bed and a big sofa bed for the children . Had no view what so ever , but no noise either . Beds were very comfortable and we all slept perfectly well . Also the 5th floor was quite handy , it’s not too high to walk up and down . Since there are only 2 lifts , they can get really busy . Check in was all fine and quick and everyone friendly and helpful . Breakfast was fab , it had everything we needed , a really big choice . Had a selection of fresh fruits and yoghurts , juices , eggs / bacon / sausages , cereals and porridge , big variety of breads / banana breads and bagels , tea and coffee . The only thing I would say , go early if you can , on our check out day we went around 9am and had to queue for a table and it was absolutely mobbed and felt a bit manic. The other days we went between 6.30 and 7.30 and it felt a lot more civilised and calmer . What we really appreciated is that you get free tea and coffee and water for free 24 hrs . It’s really handy with the kids , can top up water bottles before you head out . The only thing I would say , there was 4 of us in the room , but every day we only had 2 big towels in the bathroom . But as soon as we asked for more we got them straight away . The location is absolutely amazing . 2 walking minutes away you have got 34th Street herald square subway station , you can also walk to broadway , Times Square , Empire State Building , flat iron building , 230th roof top bar . One day we even walked back from Central Park . Also the rooftop deck is very beautiful and has an amazing Empire State view . The rooms are a bit dated , but it was all clean and tidy and the staff were always friendly and helpful . On arrival day we took a cab from JFK , on way back we took the subway from Penn station . If you have not that many bags it’s super easy , roughly 10 walking minutes from the hotel ( 8 dollars per person including the air train ) .

The rooms are comfortable, the water is hot, and the beds are firm. I had a view of the Empire State Building from my room.

Rooms are smaller than most Hyatt Place locations (I have stayed in at least half a dozen) but more than sufficient and quite large for Manhattan.Location is great, on a fairly quiet street but a quick stroll to Broadway, Time Square, etc.The hotel does not have its own parking but has an arrangement with a garage down the block. $49 a night at the front desk which is a little below average for the area and cheaper than if you had just payed the parking charge at the garage itself.Breakfast was the typical Hyatt Place spread which fills you up but doesn't excite you. I did not find it crowded at all but I am an early riser and got there when it opened at 6:30. I also had no problem with waits for the elevators as others have written but I suspect Sunday night is a fairly low-occupancy time for them.The only complaint, and it is a minor one, is that you cannot take care of the parking when you check in, they will only validate and charge it upon checkout. The reason I don't like this is that I usually check out via the Hyatt app and don't need to go to the front desk but at least when I checked out there was no line and the desk attendant was very friendly.One piece of advice -- keep checking prices even after you have booked. A few weeks after I made my reservation I noticed that the price for the same evening had come down by $30 so I cancelled and rebooked. I guess this is actually true of virtually any hotel these days with dynamic pricing based on demand.","Gaithersburg, Maryland","charlesmonkeyvillage</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gaithersburg, Maryland</strong>",190,5.0

The location is perfect. And when I say perfect, I mean perfect. We were only about a block away from Herald Square and from the subway station there, we could pretty much get everywhere we needed. Plenty of stores and restaurants were in walking distance, but I liked the fact that we weren't right in the middle of Times Square or one of the other heavy tourist locations.

Before our trip, I emailed Hyatt requesting two rooms at the top of the hotel facing the Empire State building. The response I received back seemed to indicate this wouldn't be a problem, however upon arrival we didn't receive this request which was quite disappointing. The hotel is in a good location and is within walking distance from a lot of the tourist attractions. However, even though the hotel is in a good location, the street is quite noisy. We stayed on the 14th floor roadside and we could hear the traffic all night even though we were quite high up. Our room was a good size and the bed was very comfy but there was definitely room for improvement. We had no wardrobe door and no mirror in the room, only a mirror in the bathroom which was a pain trying to get ready in the morning entirely in the bathroom. The bathroom floor was also quite cold so I would recommend taking some slippers. We also had a temperamental TV and some days it was so frustrating we didn't even bother to turn it on.The hotel breakfast was excellent and the hot food changed every day. The breakfast room was sometimes quite busy but we always managed to find a table. The lobby also has free coffee, tea and flavoured water which is a nice touch. When we checked in, we were also told we were eligible for two free bottles of water a day. However, on our last day my parents were told they weren't actually eligible for the water even though they had been given it for the past few days so this was a bit frustrating. There are also only two lifts in the hotel so you can be waiting a while for one. Make sure you go to the roof terrace on the top floor, it has a good view of the Empire State building. Overall, the hotel has it's good points but definitely needs to improve in some areas. Even though the breakfast was great, I wouldn't stay here again.","Gillingham, United Kingdom","becca_lou_lou</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gillingham, United Kingdom</strong>",12,3.0

The location is perfect for easy travelling around the city and very close to The Empire State BuildingThe room had a full sofa and footrest which dominated the space, a single chair and footrest would suit the standard rooms better in my opinion, allowing more space.Whilst accepting the building struggles for floorspace on each level, the breakfast room/bar is cramped and way too busy at peak times to enjoy a leisurely breakfast. To be fair, the hotel does advise of likely waiting times.Unfortunately the stark lighting in the room without windows does not help either.Not an easy solution to this, accepted, but judging by the reaction of fellow guests, our opinion was shared.The breakfast offer itself is exactly as expected and described for the hotel classification but plastic everything in terms of crockery, cutlery and glassware cheapens the brand, in my view.Despite that area of criticism it’s a decent budget hotel and if a good location, bed and shower are the priorities on your agenda, it fits the bill perfectly.","Derbyshire, United Kingdom","C6899YRstephenc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Derbyshire, United Kingdom</strong>",4,3.0

From the minute we arrived we were warmly welcomed by all staff from reception, dining, housekeeping and everyone in between. I was prepared for a cramped room given that alot of reviews on New York said to be warned for tiny rooms but we had a very spacious and spotlessly clean room. The bed was so comfortable after a days walking and sightseeing. The location was perfect..walking distance of almost everything and just 2 streets from the metro for the places you couldn't walk to. Our room had a large tv and fridge and safe, 2 seater couch and all other items you expect from a hotel. The en suite was clean and spacious. We had a rear facing room so no view except onto ac units of other buildings but we were not in the room for a view. We were out and about for that! 6 minute walk to the Empire State building and 10 minutes to Times Square. The buffet breakfast was all you could ask for....Cereals & porridge, yogurts & fruit, breads & muffins, tea/coffee and selection of juices , scrambled eggs daily with a different hot food each day ..sausages or bacon or potatoes etc. This was self service and plentiful. There was a 24 hour food menu reasonably priced and snack food available to buy at reception but we ate out during the day. The computer in reception with use of the printer was free to use and very useful to print our boarding passes. Free wifi in bedroom was excellent.

Hence the 3/5.Firstly the price is fine, given the location it is expected to pay $250+ for a room. In any other city I would say this isn't value for money but this is Midtown NYC so it is expected.In terms of location, you can't ask for better. The ESB is right around the corner, and there is a perfect view from the 26th floor balcony. One more than one occasion we bought lunch nearby and ate on the balcony just to enjoy the view. The staff there are very friendly and helpful. We were visiting for a special occasion and were treated to a small red wine and fruit bowl from the management team which was a lovely gesture!There are negatives however. Firstly from reviews I read it appeared that staying on a higher floor will reduce the sound of the outside noise. We were on the 21st floor and heard everything! They must have to look into more adequate sound proofing as the lack of a good night sleep was annoying. Also the mini-fridge in the room made a lot of noise too - so I plugged it out for the trip for some peace.Maybe a 3 is harsh as there are some positives, however all I use a room for is sleeping and when you are unable to get a good night sleep because of the noise outside it deters from the experience.","Walsall, England","michaeljf89</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Walsall, England</strong>",38,3.0

On our return at 3pm (check in time), the room was still not ready so we waited a short time in the reception. When our room was allocated, we had paid for a room with a view but we decided that a room on a lower floor would be better for us and therefore, we opted for a different (cheaper) room. Although we had paid for a better room, we accepted that this was our choice and we did not give the fact that we had down graded a second thought. The staff at check-in were very helpful and polite.The room was absolutely fine and the breakfast was good with a range of choices. The best thing about the Hyatt was the terrace on the 26th floor, the hotel should consider doing more in this area i.e. more comfortable seating - it's a great space!We stayed in the Hyatt for 4 nights. Unfortunately, our experience was spoilt at the check-out stage. When we requested to leave our bags until we were due to leave NY at 3pm, we were told that there was a $3 charge per bag. As we are a family of 5 with hold and cabin bags each, this added up and was an unexpected expense - this fee does not apply on arrival. I told the receptionist that this was something that I had not experienced before (despite staying in hotels in many major cities) and the response was 'it's hotel policy, nothing to do with me.' Reluctantly, we had to agree to this basically, we had little choice. Stickers were attached to the bags and we were given a receipt. At this point, I made the receptionist aware that it seemed very out of balance that when we arrived to check-in at 3pm, the room had not been ready (which we did not make a fuss about) and we had opted for a lower grade room for our 4 night stay (yes, our choice but this was advantageous to the hotel as we'd paid for one of the higher priced rooms which was then available for other guests). The receptionist looked at me, rolled her eyes and continued to do what she was doing at the desk. There was absolutely no verbal response. Given the fact that there are a few trip advisor reviews that negatively comment on this $3 bag charge, I suspect this issue comes up with some regularity so plenty of opportunity for staff to develop a response more appropriate than rolling the eyes and ignoring the guest when they speak. I have contacted Hyatt directly about our poor check-out experience and given the name of this member of staff.Last but not least, it is important for other potential guests/guests to be aware that the baggage store is essentially the dining room which is part of the publicly accessible area which is out of sight of the reception desk. I mentioned above that guests are given a receipt for their bags which states on the reverse (pic added for info): ""In consideration of the free storage of the property covered by this check, the owner or person depositing same agrees: This establishment is not liable for the theft, loss, damage or destruction of the property in the absence of gross negligence on the part of this establishment or its employees.""So essentially, guests are paying for their bags to be stored (despite the receipt saying free) in a public area which can be accessed by anyone, at anytime and the hotel is not liable if anything is stolen or lost! I should mention that we collected our bags ourselves from the dining area, changed for our flight in the reception toilets and were waiting for our taxi to collect us before a member of the reception staff asked if we had the receipt for our bags. There were a number of bags/suitcases in the dinning area and clearly, anyone with untoward intentions could either remove a bag or potentially, and more worryingly, leave something in the public area of this hotel. Hyatt please take note, your policy on baggage storage requires review both the charge and the practices around storage.",,Cookesmith,8,2.0

Unfortunately, none of the hotel staff made any effort to contact us regarding this error on their part. I even sent a lengthy email detailing our experience to Ms. Jemima Arcos (Front Office Manager) on June 4th as we thought the purse had been stolen. To this day (July 1) I have never received any response from Ms. Arcos. One would think that someone in management would make an effort to reach out to us with some sincerity and apologize and explain what happened as I provided both my email address and phone number. Nope. Nothing. My wife had to call the hotel several times before she found out what happened to her purse and it was finally sent to her.

You will see the Hyatt Place name and logo when you are directly in front of the place or driving by. If you are being dropped off at the hotel, beware that it might be easy to miss. Adjacent to the Hyatt Place hotel, there are two other hotels built right up to the sidewalk.There are over 25 floors in the hotel. There is a beautiful rooftop bar terrace. We went in early-April and it was still cold (40-45 degrees) so the bar was closed for the season, but you can bring your own drinks and enjoy the living space. The city view is very nice of the buildings during the daytime and sparking lights of buildings at night (rooftop doors are locked at 11:00pm). The upper floors have views of adjacent building rooftops. I like this view compare to lower floors where you might be looking into the next building windows. (This is New York city landscape - rooftop or windows) Note: Elevators tend to be busy and crowded during peak morning hours....if you are in the middle floors, ride up and then back down. It is a nice way to meet the fellow visitors. This hotel appears popular with overseas visitors. While I was in the elevator, lobby sitting area, or in breakfast area, I heard at least four different languages. Sometimes, we traded tips on where to eat, what to see, and what to do. The compliment breakfast tends to be hearty and adequate. Fresh juices - orange, apples, or pineapple; milk- regular, 2%, non-fat; hot and cold box cereals are available; fresh fruits - oranges and apples; fruit bowl; Greek and regular yogurt; hot scramble eggs and meat (rotates every day -- sausage, sausage patty, or bacon); waffles; bread - white, wheat, rye, and bagels; and hot tea or coffee. Hot tea and coffee available all day. I enjoy drinking their coffee. When I come back from all day outing, I stop by for a cup of coffee to bring up to my room, (I am a regular coffee drinker every day at home - drip brew or on the go - chain cafes)Our room on the 25th floor was well decorated, nice room colors, clean and bright with the sunlight coming in. There were good space to walk around the bed without bumping into each other. The shower stall was large and roomy....I didn't touch the walls if I dropped by soap bar. I also enjoyed looking at the building rooftops and taller buildings over in the next block. This hotel is well located in mid-town New York. It is right in the middle of the shopping district. Macy is one block away. Victoria Secret, H&M, Forever 21, and Target are 6-minute walk away. (I have been to NYC seven times; this time we skipped the Broadway shows and stay Midtown to be different) I really like the Hyatt Place location. Only 3-minute walk to Herald Square subway station and 6-minute walk to Greeley Square subway station. Only 7-minute walk to Koreatown where there are over 30 restaurants, cafes, and bars.

Overall staff were friendly and helpful when needed but also gave me a lot of space. My favorite staff was housekeeper Elizabeth – she is such a joy, please give my thanks to her for her hospitality, I always look forward to greeting her in the morning. The hotel was also accommodating of a request to change rooms, as the room that I was initially assigned to was on a lower floor, which wouldn’t work. As a business traveller, it is important to have a guaranteed space in the elevator as it gets very packed particularly during the morning rush hour. I always return to this hotel as I like its convenient proximity to transport, dining, and entertainment, but will have second thoughts after a recent encounter.I think that the hotel could improve on communication. We intended to extend our reservation by half a day but were left confused as various staff provided us with differing accounts on pricing, process and timing. We decided to book the extension anyway as we needed it to accommodate our flight timing. We were clear to communicate to the staff that we had a late flight so a paid extension would put us in the ideal situation. To cut the long story short, instead of being checked out, we ended up getting kicked out on checkout day as “the hotel was full”. We were given a 15 min grace period to move our stuff or risk being charged an extra day despite the hotel being “full” (which I assume means that were paying guest next in line). While we were not looking to play the blame-game as there was clearly a miscommunication, the manager on duty had failed to take ownership of the situation and instead left us in the lurch. It was already difficult on us to be taken by surprise but we felt more intimidated by the manager who was extremely defensive and spoke to us with a obey-my-policy-or-be-at-my-mercy tone. When we were a foot out of the door, the manager called us back to let us know that a reservation was cancelled and we were at liberty to book it for an extra day if we preferred. This was in my opinion a slap to the face after the inconvenience and unpleasantries and all the more affirmed my view that we were forever at their mercy.thank you Hyatt Place, it's been a great couple of years, but I think I will be moving on from here.","Singapore, Singapore","harlequeen_yx</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",75,3.0

For a hotel that goes after leisure guests, these times seem ludicrous. The cynic in me says this is done on purpose.....as the hotel hopes that people might not even bother.- those who do bother to come down pretty much all arrive in the final 45 mins......which leads to massive queues and nowhere to sit- the breakfast is touch and go, but all in all, not half bad (though I wish they'd come up with an option to offer guests an alternative to eco-killing disposable cups for coffee)- the hotel needs some new towels!- at around 370 USD a night, this was not a cheap hotel The good:- the bed is super comfy and the linen is actually quite nice- ALL of the staff I spoke with were incredibly helpful and attentive- the hotel's location is absolutely excellent (the Empire State Building is, quite literally, on top of you!).

Obviously, if you book each night differently, their system doesn't initially see it, so I received a call the next morning telling me that I needed to move to another room. After a few conversations with the morning staff, we finally sorted it out as he was unaware of the ""multiple bookings"" into one reservation; however, this gentleman decided he would school me on how I should properly book my Hyatt stays in the future (this person really needed to have his manners checked).

In that sense, the Hyatt knocks it out of the park.The Hotel - attractive hotel with ample lobby seating and even small front patio. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The bed and furnishings looked newer than most I’ve seen in NYC hotels. I found the refrigerator to be too loud so I unplugged it. Problem solved. I stayed on a high floor so the street noise was subdued. The front desk staff are very friendly, helpful, and quick. Check out took less than a minute. I usually scoff at “breakfast included” marketing, but the food was quite good. The buffet is in a well-spaced area so you don’t feel like someone is constantly standing in your way, and the choices will satisfy most visitors: cereal, oatmeal, bagels, toast, eggs, French toast, fruit, and bacon. The coffee is hot & robust- just as you’d expect in NYC. Finally the location is ideal for someone looking to get the most out of their visit to The City. It’s walking distance from Penn Station, a couple blocks from a main shopping area, and close to many subway lines. Would I return for a business trip? Probably not. However, I would return for a fun trip to NYC. I’d also recommend it to others in this regard. It’s a 1st rate budget hotel without the budget feel (smelly cleansers, bad food, lumpy bed, paper-thin walls). The Hyatt gets inexpensive travel right!

This problem would be resolved if they extended their finishing time by 1 hour. Even for people sightseeing it is way to early to be up on your holidays and as the breakfast is included most people want the value for the money they've spent. I went to breakfast once in 4 days because on the first day while carrying a very hot cup of tea another guest bumped into me (it was not his fault it was because of the large volume of people in the small breakfast room) and my wrist was scalded. The member of staff got me ice and an ice pack but when I asked for burn gel they had none. I went to the pharmacy straight away and got some so this saved the burn blistering. The staff member was very nice and helpful but I can't understand why a big hotel like this does not have burn gel for instances like this. So although your stay includeds breakfast I wouldnt count on it.

Great that breakfast was included, basic selection, but satisfied hunger pangs. Eating in NYC is not cheap so to have an included meal was good.As noted by others, waiting for elevators (lifts) can be a bit of a pain.

We went once when it was busy and after a short wait got a seat. The rest of the time we went around 8 am and got a seat without issue. The staff replenish the breakfast continually and there is a good choice of cereals, breads, doughnuts, fresh fruit salad and porridge. If you don’t like queues go early.

The breakfast looked better than it actually was, but acceptable. The reason for the 1 star rating is as follows: I needed to spend a week in Manhattan. As an Expedia rewards member, I found this hotel for under $200 a night, and decided to book it for two nights since I had never stayed there, and wanted to make sure it was as advertised and a reasonable walking distance from where I would be spending most of my days. When I received my confirmation by email a few minutes later, I realized they had only booked and charged me for one night. I immediately called the front desk, explained the error, and asked if they could make the correction. I was told that they would not be able to match the rate and that the rate had to be set through Expedia. I called Expedia, and THEY said they would have to call the hotel to get their permission to do so. The Hotel manager refused, and then Expedia informed me that they could not add a night, but would have to cancel my reservation ( at $200.00 / night ) and re-book it for 2 nights at $500 plus a night ! ( $1025 with tax, more than 5 times the advertised rate ) I asked the Expedia rep if she realized what she was asking me to do, got a moment of silence, then I refused, and kept the one night @$200.00, since they had already charged my credit card. I arrived at the Lobby and spoke with the manager. He said he was unable to help me since “rates are subject to change without notice.” I tried again the following morning, and would have been willing to accept some type of compromise, since we were already checked in. But there was absolutely no effort form management to even try to adjust the rate even though there was plenty of availability. The only response was “Sorry , our rates are subject to change.” I checked out and spent the rest of the week at a 4 star hotel 3 blocks away. It was like a classic “bait and switch scheme” which I would not have expected from a Hyatt Hotel. The next morning, while sitting at breakfast in my new hotel, I received an email from Hyatt, welcoming me to the “Hyatt Experience”. Really???",,Monkey C M,0,1.0

What wasn't great was that there was no security and after they were evicted from hotel, came up the stairs back into the room after 4am and used their key cards again as the Manager did not take them off them. And to add to all that, was threatened by one of the party goers at the lift the next morning. As I was a women travelling alone, that was very freighting. Hotel were apologetic of course, and refunded my night, but is a serious issue when the party goers get chucked out of hotel only to be able to get right back in again.

The area feels safe, and close to many places to eat. The rooms are clean, and for NYC a comfortable size. A favourable thing also is there are only a small number of rooms on each floor so you do not have to drag your bags down long hallways, and the chances of being disturbed by other guests is low, making it a quiet hotel. I did not notice any street noise at all, another plus as this is a common experience in New York Hotel rooms.I did not try the breakfast so can not provide insight into that, but I liked that they provided cards in the rooms that guided on when the best times were based on the times people use the facility.Unfortunately I did have issues, but the responsiveness to these has helped change my thoughts on this hotel. Housekeeping did not respond to my request for a Hairdryer - turns out it is in the drawer under the TV. The biggest issue I had was when I arrived parts of the carpet were saturated (apparently as a result of the storm that came through NYC that day), so I provided feedback to housekeeping who did try to remediate, however, when I returned to the hotel mid afternoon to find a carpet machine in the room, it did mean I could not take a short break before heading downtown. I asked at reception how long it will be to which I was told I could still use the room, and my response of 'well its hardly peaceful' was met with nothing more than an 'I know'. There was no acknowledgement of the inconvenience, or apology at the time. Through their customer service feedback to management I raised these issues, and to their credit, Kyle responded very quickly and acknowledged the shortfalls of my experience.

The location is great. One block to subway. Walking distance to many iconic NYC buildings and locations that we are all familiar with from news, movies, etc. The problems: I found the front desk staff to be friendly but not proactive in solving problems. I had to get a supervisor in order to get a change in rooms as the first room choice was totally inappropriate. Later I had to ask for towels that were not replaced. The front desk agreed to take care of it and did not. It took me a couple of tries to get the people that serviced our room to give us extra pillows and to replace the worn out pillows. They should be authorized to make those changes on the fly as they see the wear and tear every day.The biggest challenge is the two elevators. Normally they are fine. During busy hours, particularly the last hour before breakfast ends, they are terrible. One day I had to go down from the 11th floor to the first floor by stair. My wife figured out that, rather than waiting 15-20 minutes and seeing full elevator after full elevator, she hit both the up and down button, caught an elevator going up which then guaranteed her that she would have an elevator to go down in. I cannot recommend that wheelchair or mobility challenged individuals have to deal with this. However, we now understand the issue and can work around it. Hotel might look at the elevator “call for service” algorithms.

One thing I was really impressed with was that the two nights we stayed were paid for in Hyatt points. I expected to be getting the crappiest room in the place bc we didn't pay cash for this stay. I am really happy that your people understand that in order to get those points, we stayed many other times at a Hyatt and also use our Hyatt Credit card for almost everything. We were given a great room on the top floor, amazing view and very quiet (which was wonderful bc I had come down with an awful cold and wasn't sleeping well to begin with). The hotel itself was really nice! We normally stay at the Grand Hyatt by Grand Central Station, but honestly we don't use most of the amenities bc we are out all day and night with business and social engagements when we are visiting NYC. Hyatt Place was also closer to the subway lines we use most via Herald Square. The Hyatt Place obviously is a different type of hotel from The Grand Hyatt, but was a great hotel, and perfect for our needs. We will definitely consider it again in the future. We are rarely brand loyal for things these days, but we are generally Hyatt loyal bc we just don't have time to read 1000 reviews on Tripadvisor. We are normally on a deadline with chaotic travel needs, and just want to book something quickly and know it's going to be good. We have never been disappointed with any Hyatt stay. We are not particularly demanding guests, but even if something was amiss once in awhile, it has always been quickly addressed if possible. I don't usually write reviews bc time is just non-existent, but the staff was wonderful and we were really happy with how we were treated. I have worked in restaurant and hospitality, and I know that it is NOT easy work keeping people happy (especially with so much competition in NYC).","Plattsburgh, NY, United States","Z275HJamyr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plattsburgh, NY, United States</strong>",0,5.0

Once we arrived, we should ask for him, we did, and he rolled out the red carpet. Gave us a top floor room, although not a view of the Empire State, as there is a rooftop terrace on that side on the top floor. Our view was of the rest of New York! Jaw dropping! As at that side, that floor its more or less unobstructed.Whilst catching our breath, a knock at the door; a basket with snacks and drinks and (small) bottles of wine arrive, with the compliments of William. Like he didn’t do enough. All in all, a very comfortable stay, and impressive service. Room large for NYC standards. And to top it off, this stay was on points.

Having booked the room for five people on Hyatt website, we were surprised to discover at our arrival that the bedroom was equipped for only four people. As a matter of fact, the bathroom was only having four apparent towels, one soap and a sofa-bed with no sheets. We therefore indicated to the reception desk that we desired more supplies for our stay.For each consecutive day, we had to remind the reception staff that we were missing supplies, as the cleaning staff removed the additional supplies each day, leaving supplies for only four people. Also, on the first days of our trip to NYC, the cleaning staff mistakenly removed the teddy bear of one of us. Unable to retrieve it, the reception staff offered us a free night but the harm was done. We tried to contact them a week ago through Facebook to have a last update about the teddy bear. We got no answer.Hyatt Place nonetheless offered a good price-quality deal, combining comfort with an excellent bedding quality, calm rooms, and a large buffet for breakfasts.

Initially our vacation started a little rocky when I found a bug in the room, however, the front desk quickly moved us to another room. We were supposed to check out 7/1, however I ended up hospitalized 6/30 and had emergency surgery to remove my gallbladder. While my husband had to pack up and move rooms, which was a hassle under the circumstances, he got it done and everything was good (or so we thought). I arrived back at the hotel 7/2 to rest until our flight home. The front desk even left cupcakes (unfortunately I cannot eat) which was a sweet gesture. I'm most upset though because my daughter had a bag with multiple signed playbills either stolen or thrown away. When we arrived back at the hotel my daughter was looking for her things and the housekeeping staff had moved several items in the room and put items in the closet (which the front desk says it NOT their policy). We called down to the front desk and as of check out, the housekeeping supervisor had no idea who cleaned our room 7/2 AM. My teenage daughter is heartbroken, as she had put them in a separate bag on top of the desk, not knowing they would be stolen or thrown away. We spent a lot of money on shows and stood at 5 stage doors for hours to get these autographs. As an aspiring actress, they are priceless to her.

I found the Hyatt Place through Booking.com and got a very nice deal for the week. I phoned the hotel and informed them of our anniversary, and the hotel staff took care of the rest from there.Upon check-in, once we got to the place (getting lost in Manhattan while walking is not a fun experience when carrying luggage, a cab is highly advised!), we found ourselves at the top floor, in one of four penthouse suites (I suppose... not big enough to be called a suite really but it was far more than what we expected!) with a gorgeous skyline view of the city. A care package had been left in our room, and the first night we decided to just order in. The hotel does offer room service, as it were, but it's pick-up. No big issue there.We felt like we were in the Waldorf-Astoria (which will no longer be the same once it reopens... so sad!) we were treated so well. The room was superb, although a tad cramped for space towards the window. We wound up putting the ottoman on its side and tucking it away so we wouldn't trip over it. The in-hotel breakfast was excellent!! Everything was refilled constantly, and the hot stuff kept hot, cold items kept on ice... excellent job, Hyatt!! This is a good hotel for the center of Manhattan, and within walking distance to the Empire State Building. Very friendly red-vested CityPass or NewYorkPass agents outside the hotel will direct you wherever you need or want to go, and will remember you for multiple-day stays. Some even become friends ;)We'll definitely be returning. Now if they'd only lower their one-night-stay prices a little... I could afford to stay more often :)","Aberdeen, Maryland","Stan T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aberdeen, Maryland</strong>",11,5.0

Empire state building was just a block away, Shake Shake was 2 blocks and plenty of Walgreens nearby in case you forgot something like we did. The included breakfast was as expected for the Hyatt, eggs, toast, pancakes, occasional potato, cereal, fruit,etc. The rooms seemed tight but since this is my first trip to NYC I have heard they were spacious for a NYC hotel room. My only complaint would be that the pillows are extremely flat. I never did ask for a new one and they may have been accommodating had I done so but i just doubled up my pillows.

If I'd gotten a deal and the hotel was sub $175, or even $150, I might feel a little different. The room is well appointed and clean but not particularly interesting in the way of decor. Definitely no complaint here though, especially if you are on a little weekend getaway. Location is excellent and you can walk to a lot of places and easily get several metro lines.Breakfast is okay and varied from day to day a little, which was nice. Lines do form around 8:15/8:30 but they notify you of that on posters in the elevator so it is no surprise.I was on a higher floor, which was great with nice view and less noise but the elevators in this hotel are truly awful. There are only two and they are slow. So if you are trying to get anywhere during a busy time (breakfast, evening when everyone comes back) plan ahead. My key stopped working and I had to go back down to get it re-coded. It took 20 minutes - and it was not the staff/desk that was the issue. They were speedy. It was the elevator waiting and then stopping on every floor on the way up. Oh, and in the morning the cleaning crew uses the main elevator so expect a few more stops for that. They really should get a service elevator. Staff was okay. Nice enough but mostly lackadaisical. Clearly not a four star + hotel. It is a Hyatt Place after all. Overall it is a solid place to camp out for a few days; for business, however, I'd prefer a different type of hotel.

I woke up all mornings to a beautiful view of Manhattan buildings and the Empire State building. The rooms are reasonable size for a mid-town hotel, well done, modern in design and with contemporary fittings. And the rooms also achieve that rare state of nirvana where the heating is perfect.A couple of things for the management to think about - the coffee shop is tiny and the breakfast spread is basic, so on a weekend there's mad squander for breakfast, and when you're travelling from Asia, you're not really used to lining up or jostling for space when you serve yourself breakfast.

Rooms on the back side are quiet, I prefer a low floor at this location due to the slow elevators (mentioned in many reviews). It's easy to walk down to lobby/street level from a low floor. Rooms at this Hyatt Place are larger than most NYC hotels, although they are not the usual layout of most Hyatt Place locations with a totally separate living area. The sofa and ottoman in the room make a big difference in comfort. My stay this time was greatly enhanced by excellent service from front desk employee William H. He went over and above to help me several times, especially at check-in. My only complaint from this stay is the hotel has removed the full-length mirror in the room, it used to be on the closet door. The closet door was not there, I thought that very odd. A floor-length mirror is a must in any hotel room, not having one is a problem.I would definitely stay at this property again and do recommend it to others.

Other than these small things there really isn't much wrong with the Hyatt.

My response was quick and I was kindly told me my request has been added to my reservation. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were given a room on the 5th floor. We explained we had contacted CS in March but they knew nothing about it and the 5th was the highest floor they could offer but if we came back down in the morning once some people had checked out, we may get something better.Our first night, at the front of the hotel was a very noisy, sleepless one but thankfully we ended up with a nice quiet room on 24th floor with a fantastic view of the empire state building out of our window - huge thank you to Tamon for sorting that for us! (We think that was his name!) The holiday wouldn't have been the same if we hadn't been moved so we really did appreciate it.I'd like to add here, this wouldn't stop me from staying again but I do feel that customer services shouldn't say something has been added to my reservation if it hasn't - or if it had then it should be made clearer for the hotel to actually see it.The room was nice and modern, bed and pillows were very comfortable, nice big TV, free wifi and the power shower was fantastic.Breakfast was a mix of hot and cold, our first few days we really enjoyed it (the egg and bacon muffins, yummy!) but the last couple of days not so much (not keen on those sausages and I'm afraid! and there was less variety of fruit).. But it's free which many of the other hotels don't offer so can't complain. They had English breakfast tea which was really good to see. The lift was slow when busy but we also noticed it would get stuck in one place a lot - don't know if this was the cleaners keeping it there or someone messing about but it got frustrating.Hotel is in a fantastic location, plenty of shops, restaurants etc within walking distance. Bryant Park, Macys and Times Square all very close (highly recommend Bubba Gump!). We even walked down to the Brooklyn bridge and into Brooklyn one day! There is so much to see on the way to everything, you don't realise how far you're walking.. Our phones tracked that we walked over 50 miles that week!Hotel booked us a taxi back to the airport, was told it was a fixed price ($62) and included everything.. I asked if this included the toll etc and she said 'yes, everything' but the driver wanted more once we got there. Thankfully we hadn't spent up and were too tired to argue.

Had to wait for three hours at 10 am after a red eye flight from SFO before I could check in. Hyatt Place's rooms at other properties in Chicago and CA have larger rooms with a couch and seating area, table, chair and larger bathrooms. However, this is Manhattan - the rooms are much smaller - more focus on functional aspects of the room - less on the aesthetics. The room though was one of the smallest I have stayed in. Small tiny closet. If you have too much luggage, it may be an issue. Otherwise, the room comfort and value for money considering the absolutely brilliant location is unbeatable. If you are looking to enjoy New York and are seeking a comfortable stay without a huge hole in your pocket, this is it. If money is limit and you are looking for fine dining and an uber luxurious stay, look at the Hyatt Andaz instead.","Chennai (Madras), India","AkshayGN</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chennai (Madras), India</strong>",39,4.0

We had a great time and thoroughly enjoyed the interactions with all the other runners and foreign visitors in the common living area, dining room, and elevators. We arrived at the hotel extremely early due to our red-eye flight from California. We took the A-train from JFK/Howard Beach and got off at Penn Station. Our room was not available yet since it was sold out, but the host at checkin was extremely welcoming and offered to hold our bags and invited us to join them for breakfast! After breakfast, we started to explore the City.Location:The hotel is conveniently located. Easy walking distance to Time Square, Empire State Building, Penn Station, Bryant Park, Grand Central, and Broadway. The expo for the NYC Marathon took place at the Javits Center which is just a 1-mile walk along 36th.Hotel:The hotel is clean and includes breakfast. Keep in mind the breakfast hours. We noticed a few late comers surprised to see breakfast ended at 9:00am on weekdays. The dining area is awkward and can be difficult to navigate through when crowded. There are 2 elevators that can get claustrophobic and move at a snail's pace during high traffic breakfast time. A fitness room is also available in the basement.Room:Comfortable size considering you're in New York. Bed was extremely comfortable. We were offered a high level room which had some view of the skyline. I've heard there are some with views of the Empire State building but those are more highly requested. You will hear a lot of NYC noises and sirens at night, but that will be true with any place you stay in the area.Conclusion:Next time we come back to NYC, we will definitely consider staying here again. It has an ideal location, comfort, and an exceptional staff.

The hotel is a five minute walk from the Empire State building and really close to the subway. The rooms are a good size for NYC and ours was completely silent at night. The only reason I'm not giving this hotel a 5 star review is due to the breakfast situation. Yes, they warn you about queues for the breakfast so you can avoid them - but the issue I had was not simply with the quality of the breakfast, but the fact that it is served on non-recyclable plastic covered paper plates, which are then thrown out. In my opinion, if you are going to put up a sign in the bathroom saying that you are an eco-friendly hotel, so please reuse towels (which I'll happily do), please use plates and a dishwasher for the hundreds you serve every morning. I understand many of you reading this will think this is a minor point, but I think companies such as the Hyatt need to be leaders in this area, and I was disappointed to see the hypocrisy at work here.Nevertheless, I would recommend this hotel for its location.","Hamilton, New Zealand","Charlotte W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, New Zealand</strong>",42,4.0

Near Penn Station, easy access to major subways up or downtown. 36th St relatively quiet with a number of similar looking hotels (all mostly new). We previously stayed at the Executive Hotel Le Soleil New York next door (which I have a poor review to). Contrast since both hotels have similar floor layout.Check-in was super fast and friendly staff. Our King Room was on 23th floor (floors only have 8 rooms each). Stunning view (see pic) with floor to ceiling windows. Very bright. Very large for NYC standard. Plenty of room for 2 people and include a couch. Windows relatively soundproof (this area of town has lots of construction). Bedding comfortable, plenty of lighting, desk area workable (not large but enough and well designed). Bathroom was large walk-in shower and in good repair. AC worked well and was quiet and not drafty. Internet speed (free) was excellent. Business center had super fast printer and easy to quickly print out boarding passes.Breakfast was included, nothing special, there are plenty of places to wander to in less than a block, but on a cold or rainy day a nice touch.Overall, very positive hotel and I would look to re-book here on a future stay. Hyatt knows how to run hotel properties and it shows.Note: 26th floor has open terrace (no food service), but nice view of Empire State Building. Please don't ruin this treat view by being a bad guest making noise or being a stupid tourist (otherwise the hotel will lock the doors).","Hong Kong, China","roadwarrior30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",353,4.0

Looking at the hotel from the street, not much to it, just like most hotels in New York. They just squeeze another 26 story hotel among all the other buildings. You cannot even see the hotel if you stand at the end of the street. The front lobby, not much to it. Front desk person… she should have been doing the dishes in the back or emptying the trash cans. I am not kidding you, this person only words to me were “id and credit card”. Nothing else. Good thing she wrote the room number on the key card envelope. Where do they find these people anyway???? Oh well…. The room, on the 25th floor was great. Excellent view of the Empire State building from our room. Room was large (by New York standards), even had a couch, coffee and refrigerator. Things I have given up completely from New York hotels.The hotel does not have pool, but it does have a gym. They also have a free breakfast, not cooked to order, but they do have hot items. The food is average. Being New York, expect large crowds at breakfast time. So pack your patience or take your breakfast to go.There is a bar, kind of… you must go to the front desk and ask someone to get you a drink… really, not kidding. The Best Western right next door has a small bar with a bartender. We actually went there for drinks. Much nicer and relaxed.The best part about this hotel is its location. 15 minute walk to the Flatiron building, 15 minute walk to Times Square, and it is right next to Macy’s so lots of shopping to be done. And of course, right next door to the Empire State Building.I have stayed at a few New York hotels (see my Yotel review for where NOT to stay) and this is a nice, decent hotel.","Seattle, Washington","Franz H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",54,4.0

As a frequent traveler, I know that buffet scrambled eggs are usually nothing special, but the ones here at Hyatt Place were as good as if they'd been ordered a la carte. I took special notice of how well designed the bathroom was. Plenty of towels, and careful attention to details like a grab-bar in the shower that had a textured hand-hold rather than just being a slick metal tube.

Maybe I'm being stereotypical here, but when you think of New York City hotels that are close to everything, you typically think of PRICEY, DIRTY, AND LOUD! I couldn't have been more mistaken! Hyatt Place NY Midtown South is in the perfect location. Everything is within walking distance! My fiancé and I went to a Broadway show that was just 7 blocks away at Times Square. There was a Dunkin Donuts and a Starbucks at the end of the block the hotel is on. We enjoyed a delicious dinner at a beautiful restaurant the next street over. Everything is right within your reach!Now for the cleanliness- surpassed everything I expected! We arrived at our room and it smelled fresh and clean, the bathroom was spotless, and there was not a thing out of place. Kudos to the housekeeping staff because they obviously pay very close attention to detail and it shows. The volume- As I had mentioned, we were just a few blocks away from Times Square, in the middle of New York City...and we barely heard any noise from our street-facing room on the 9th floor. Coming from a household that is always loud and dirty, I didn't want to leave this clean, quiet hotel. The only reason I did not rate 5 stars is because we were told that breakfast would be served until 11am. We got there at 10, and they were already putting things away, so there wasn't much of a spread.But of course, that shouldn't stop you from staying here. Beautiful hotel, wonderful views, walkable routes, and very kind and courteous staff all around. You would be a fool not to stay here!",,Colleen H,2,4.0

We didn't want the hotel to cost the earth given we were there to explore the city and not spend a lot of time in the hotel, but at the same time we wanted somewhere that was pleasant and a good location. Hyatt Place was exactly this and more!The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from Times Square, 5 minutes away from Macy's and the New York Public Library is about 5 minutes up the road, so an ideal place to explore. Penn Station is also a 10 minute walk away if that so perfect for getting around the city/to and from airports. The hotel itself was quiet and welcoming. Staff were helpful and check in was super quick. We had heard rumours of resort fees, not related to this hotel but others, and we have previously travelled to Las Vegas where resort fees are everywhere, so we were prepared to be caught out. However, despite offering a free breakfast and Wi-Fi there were no resort fees, which was an added bonus. The room itself was perfect. We had a king size bed and a sofa in the room as well as a large TV and coffee/tea facilities. The bed was one of the comfiest I have ever slept in! The bathroom was great, good size with an amazing large shower. The whole room was quite modern and clean with maid service every day. It's not a luxurious hotel (felt like it catered to business people more so than tourists, which was actualyl a good thing) but it is perfect and has everything you need if you're after something clean, warm and tidy during a city break. Breakfast is free and it's a buffet style which we enjoyed - pancakes/French toast/hot options/fruit salad/cereal/pastries etc. This was an ideal start to each day as we didn't have to worry about finding a place to eat breakfast before we set out for the day. Wi-Fi was good although connections played up a bit (this could've been my phone though as the I-pad worked fine).The hotel is located on 36th Street which houses a few offices/businesses and a couple of bars. Our room faced this street but noise didn't really disturb us. Sometimes we heard the rubbish carts early at 5am but that didn't really bother us.Overall we were really pleased with our choice of hotel. Location, services and room prices were excellent and great value for money. Would definitely recommend staying here for a NYC break and would visit again.","Worcestershire, United Kingdom","Kate C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Worcestershire, United Kingdom</strong>",4,4.0

The usual places I stay in midtown were overly pricey, so I stumbled upon this hotel. The price was very good for a ""holiday"" long weekend, and the location was great. I know midtown is busy and typically a place crowded with tourists, but it is also convenient if you want a central place to base in. And this hotel was in a good area. Not quite as crowded as right in times square area, and still near a number of subway lines (Herald Square station) for easy access to the city. It's half a long block and a short block from the nearest entrance, which was very nice on cold, snowy windy days! You could spend more time underground out of the weather. And if the weather is nice, it's an easy walk to popular locations and theaters.The hotel itself was quite comfortable. I booked a ""city view"" room and was glad I did. It puts you on a higher floor (and was only $10 more per night). This is nice if you want to be ""above"" a lot of the city noise, although the streets right around the hotel are not overly noisy. The hotel is small per floor - seemed like 10-12 rooms to a floor, but the rooms themselves were quite good sized for NYC (not sure why others thought they were small - they must have stayed in much more expensive hotels in NYC than I have - and usually stay in the mid-range hotels similar to Hyatt and up). I was lucky and had very quiet neighbors, so I can't say how much room noise you might hear. The elevators were very fast, and not too busy when I was coming/going. Everything worked as it should in the room. The shower (no tub in my room) was very large and didn't make a leaky mess around the bathroom like many in other rooms I've stayed in. There were lots of outlets to plug your devices into, and my king room had a sofa to sit on in addition to a desk. Wifi was very good in my room.The breakfast was adequate. It was fresh and hot/cold as it should be, but there wasn't a lot of variety. The hot foods were basically the same both mornings I ate there, but there were enough other options that you could have a variety for several mornings if you wanted to. A decent sized area for sitting/eating too, although I ate when it wasn't that crowded. But it was definitely filling and included with your room price, so that's a plus in NYC for sure.Staff were very friendly and helpful and professional.Great choice for a midtown hotel and good value.",INDIANAPOLIS,"INTrvlGy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>INDIANAPOLIS</strong>",20,5.0

Need I say more?All around I was very pleased with my stay at this hotel. I had seen the exterior on a prior NYC visit and thought it might be worth a try. The location is good -- half a block west of 5th Avenue -- and overall it seemed to be a quiet street for midtown Manhattan. Arrival was good and the the check in quick with a very friendly staff. However when I went into the room it was not exactly what I booked. Since it was just a one night stay I figured it was not worth the effort but I mentioned it at the front desk and they insisted on making it right. They blamed Hyatt.com for not giving them complete information and even when I said I did not want to take the time/effort to move my bags they insisted and said they would happily move everything for me. They could have said well as long as you are not upset ....and left me where I was.The room was very comfortable. I booked the king bed room and while it is not large it was very good. What I really liked is it had a sofa in the window so you had a place to sit other than the less comfortable desk chair or the bed. Many of the hotels in this rate category don't have a comfy chair in the room so this was a real bonus. There was a small but workable desk, big tv and a good bed. I don't look for a frige but there was one in the room if that matters to you. Bathroom was equally serviceable with a large shower.Everything looked clean. There were some small signs of wear but nothing that was upsetting or made you hesitate.Added feature of the hotel is they include breakfast for the guests. It had a good selection of cold cereal, fruit, hot oatmeal, egg sandwiches, pancakes, breads with a toaster and coffee and tea. It is not the most elaborate but its included and no one will go hungry. (Note to management individual serve yogurt would be a good addition as opposed to an open bowl .... also better food safety.)Price wise the hotel was a few dollars more than competing products in the same area but for the room comfort I would say it is worth it versus some of the others I had stayed at in the same area.All the interactions with the staff were very friendly and them seemed genuinely interested in making sure you had a nice stay.Really no complaints .....

We did not use the parking that was available through the hotel because I found a place around the corner that was a little cheaper, however, we had to carry all of our belongings the 2-3 blocks from the parking area to the hotel and the less you have to drive in downtown, the better, so the extra money may be well spent for not having to endure those inconveniences. Upon arrival, they did not have my reservation from booking.com (which I normally call the hotel and double check, but don't usually have any problems with so I guess it slipped my mind this time), luckily the gentleman behind the counter gave us what we needed after I showed him my print out from booking.com. Thank God they even had any empty rooms! Not only that, he checked us in and told us we could go to our room and get breakfast at the buffet if we wanted!!! I kept waiting for some extra charges to show up on the bill due to these things, but there were no extra charges!! The car was cramped on our 7 hour car ride and I get frazzled from city driving, so I was extremely grateful and we promptly ate and took a nap. The location was wonderful and within walking distance of everything we needed. Our room was on the 12th floor and was spacious enough for the 5 of us with 2 queen beds and a sofa bed. There was also a fridge. If you craned your neck you could see the top section of the empire state building. I never saw any housekeepers, maybe because of the holiday, but there was a fully stocked cart in the hallway both days. When we went to check-out, the hotel was gracious enough to hold our bags until we returned so that we did not have to lug everything with us or cut our trip short because of this. This made me extremely happy!! Everyone we had contact with was very nice and I feel this hotel was a great deal. The only negative things I have to say are that the buffet isn't amazing, but it is way more than most hotels offer in the area for free and the added value for a family is worth it.

I found a coupon through Costco and was able to get a rate for around $330/night. The rooms are not too large but that's expected when staying in Manhattan. I also liked how there was free internet and a full breakfast. When reading reviews on TA, I was concerned regarding the complaints about the wait time for the elevator, but we never had a to wait for more than 2 minutes even during the peak breakfast time and most times there was a very short wait for it. There's only 8 rooms per floor so it's not like you're staying in a massive hotel with only two functioning elevators. Also, my only concern was that our room was never cleaned when we stayed there. Granted, we are from Los Angeles and were late risers, but still, our room was never cleaned even though we were gone for several hours at a time. We saw the housekeeping cart outside and saw her cleaning the other rooms when we would leave but she never cleaned our room for some reason.The hotel has a great location and is right off Herald Square and close walking distance to major sites including Macy's, the Flatairon Building, the Empire State Building and Times Square. Another thing I liked was that there wasn't too much noise at night (we stayed on the 18th floor), which is rare for a hotel in Midtown but I think it's because it's off 36th St. which isn't a majorly chaotic street. I have stayed at the Grand Hyatt and Sheraton by Times Square before and remember I could still hear noise from the streets even though we were staying towards the top of the building.Just a tip, when leaving JFK airport, take the AirTrain to Jamaica Station then take the Long Island Railroad into Penn Station and walk about 10 minutes to the hotel. Don't take the subway into the city because that was brutal and took over an hour to reach Penn Station with so many stops. When we arrived we asked someone at the info desk at JFK about how to get into the city because we didn't want to pay $70 for a taxi and she advised us to take the E line but that was completely wrong and a waste of time. The LIRR will get you to Penn Station in about 15-20 minutes with two stops only.","Los Angeles, California","aiyaaah</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",39,4.0

It is still clean, modern, well situated and convenient. What has changed is the staff and I MEAN CHANGED!!! The former staff was so friendly, accommodating, helpful, and so interested in the guests' concerns, comforts, and needs. Update October, 2015 and the staff now is not friendly, helpful, or accommodating. They are negligent, lax, and neglectful of their duties and their guests. The maintenance people are super speedy, friendly and efficient and the staff responses to requests for towels, bedding, and other amenities is very good. Luisa, our housekeeper, was amazing. What has changed are the greetings when entering and leaving, the smiling faces of the front desk, and the night staff. Most of them do not even look up when you arrive or depart or even try to know who you are. These people need a lot of training about how to treat their guests and execute their jobs properly. They are in the service industry. Raul was the only person I found helpful and friendly. Rich is still there but was on vacation until 2 days before I left after staying there 2 weeks. He gave me a big hello as he remembered me from 18 months ago!My departure from the hotel was an abomination. I had 3 bags that I put on the elevator and arrived at the lobby. I am 71 yrs old, have a cane, and am arthritic. As i struggled to get my bags out of the elevator, members of the staff were mulling about doing nothing but talking to each other and NOT ONE PERSON came to help me. As I was getting out the second bag from the elevator, the door closed and I shot up to the 20th floor, A very nice gentleman entered and he offered to help me. When we arrived in the lobby, HE helped me out the elevator. No staff member came to help me out the door. My limo driver was waiting outside and the gentleman from the elevator helped me to the door. The gal at the front desk looked up at me and suggested I use the regular door rather than the revolving doors as it would be ""easier"" for me to get my bags to the curb!!!!!!! Hello? She couldn't call upon one of the staff doing nothing??? Raul and Rich were not on duty yet. I was absolutely fuming at this lack of professionalism. I was at a hotel, for heaven's sake! That kind of assistance should be automatic. After spending $5,500+ at this hotel for such negligent service, I was enraged at this inattentive behavior of the front desk and EVERY staff member mulling about at 7:30 AM. I really should give this hotel 2 stars but it is clean and modern. They should really get their act together. I will be calling the manager about this incident and let he/she know how disappointed I am. 'Will I stay here again?

For the regular business traveler, this is a good, solid hotel that is fairly new. The desk, housekeeping and maintenance staff are friendly and focused on customer service. HOWEVER, if you are traveling with your family, or if you plan to book a room using Hyatt points, you should be aware that the king + sofabed rooms, which are all you can book with points, are all handicap rooms. These rooms have roll-in showers with no curb, and the showerhead points directly towards the curtain rather than the wall. The result is when you take a shower the entire bathroom floor gets flooded with water. On one occasion I even had the water from the shower seep through the wall and wet the carpets next to the bed.In addition, the management at this hotel is not very focused on customer service, and if you have an issue, they are not willing to work with you to resolve the situation. In July I booked a room for business at the end of one week and the beginning of the following week, and then reserved a room with points over the weekend so my daughter could come up and spend the weekend with me. When I checked in, I asked to have the same room through the entire stay. I was told that the weekend room booked with points had to be a king + sofabed room because that's all you can book with points. I told them I didn't want a handicapped room. Of course, since I stayed there all the time, the person at the desk accommodated me and booked me in a room with two double beds for the entire stay, but told me I would need to come and have new keys made on Friday because it was in the system as separate reservations due to booking the weekend room with points. When I went down to get new keys made on Friday, I was told that I had to move rooms, apparently because the manager had removed the hold on the room for my weekend stay. After some back and forth conversation that had the desk clerk running to the office 5 or 6 times to talk to the manager on duty, the manager finally came out to talk to me personally. He was quite rude and dismissive, but finally told me he would see what he could do. I told him I had 30 minutes until I needed to leave to catch the train to the airport, and he assured me he would have an answer to me before I needed to leave. I did not hear from him, so I had to go back to the desk, where I was told the manager wasn't available, but they couldn't accommodate me and I needed to move rooms. This caused me to miss the train, which left my daughter waiting alone at Newark Airport. I sent a note to Hyatt corporate explaining the situation and asking for an apology - not because they couldn't accommodate me, but because the manager was rude and didn't do as he promised and get back to me so I could make my train. I received a reply stating that the hotel manager would contact me directly. It's been three months, and I have not heard anything from Hyatt even though I have inquired about a response since then.I will not stay in this hotel again. It's a shame, too, because it's a pretty good hotel. Still, if the manager isn't interested in good customer service, I'm not interesting in staying there. If, after all of this, you still want to stay here, I have some advice:- do not book a king + sofabed room unless you are handicapped- ask for a higher floor, because the street noise can be very loud- ask for a room at the back, which means you will have a view of the Empire State Building- the wait for the elevator is long, particularly in the morning when everyone is heading down to breakfast. Take the stairs- they have a good breakfast that's included in the room rate. It includes hot food- ask at the desk about places to eat. They sometimes have coupons.","Nashville, Tennessee","cyclgrl7</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",20,2.0

The staff, from the front desk (especially Dulce) to the hotel engineer (who one evening kindly doubled as the bartender), were exceptionally nice. The room was smallish (it is Manhattan) but was clean, quiet and comfortable. My room faced 36th Street (there was hardly any road noise) and had a view of the old Pam Am (now Met Life) building.

I was fortunate to have found this Hyatt Place as it met all of our needs. We arrived in late morning, several hours before the official check-in time. The front desk attendant offered to upgrade my family of three to a room with an Empire State Building view. Our luggage was stored for us and upon our return later in the afternoon, all we had to do was ask for our keys and head to our room. The room was very clean and well appointed. However, what we did not realize was that the rooms with the ESB view do NOT have a sleeper sofa. They just have a regular sofa. Of course, the front desk attendant should have known this, but by the time we discovered that the sofa did not fold out into a bed, we had unpacked and basically taken over the room. We decided to stay in the room and enjoy the view (as opposed to repacking and moving rooms). The room was extremely quiet and the layout of the hotel kept the hallway noise down. The breakfast room was very busy each morning, but the staff did a great job of keeping the items stocked. I agree with other reviewers that the offerings could include more items like yogurt and fresh fruit. However, the breakfast is included in your room rate and definitely helps keep the budget in check. All of the staff were friendly and helpful.

But then again you are paying perhaps 1/4 of what they get at the Lanham just up the street on the corner of Fifth Avenue. This is a fairly new conversion of a dreary old apartment or office building. The rooms are sparkling clean and fitted out with appropriate amenities for a budget to mid-range property. It has about as much character as an airport lounge, but if you ask for a room in the back it will be quiet enough with the ""white noise of the HVAC system drowning out any traffic noise. There are only a handful of rooms on each floor, and with 28 or so floors and 2 elevators you are introduced to the typical Manhattan past time of waiting for elevators.A good firm king bed, a large flat screen television, a sofa, frigobar, desk and chair, good lighting and forgettable art work, all you need for a generic and acceptable brief stay. The tiny closet and the efficient but austere bathroom with fairly thin towels are not conducive to a lengthy sojourn. Two layers of light deadening shades keep the sunlight out and hide the very dusty windows. Too bad we are breathing that stuff in Midtown.I suspect they see this price point segment in competition with Hampton Inn and Courtyard, and frankly I think Hilton and Marriott do a better job in this sector. Still, the Hyatt staff are friendly; the included breakfast (steam table hot items and good Starbucks coffee and juice) will do; wifi, printing and nearly 24 hour food service are valued perks.Would I stay here again? Perhaps. There are plenty of hotels, and many of them new, in this price range. Location and loyalty programs will probably influence your choice.On the night and morning of our stay, the hotel was packed with mostly foreign tourists and their families, a wholesome and bargain seeking bunch.

Only people who were waiting for their rooms looking unhappy.The breakfast was a mess. Very long lines with dirty tables because only one person was cleaning the room. They had positioned the toaster right in the middle of the breakfast line and no one was moving until their bagel got toasted. Long wait and they knew this would happen and staff saw it all along.I received a customer satisfaction survey to complete via email three days after our stay, filled it out immediately and described our stay.

The TV in my room didn't work. I tried calling the front desk but after no one answered (over 5 minutes of ringing), I just gave up. I had dinner plans and need to meet some coworkers. When I was checking out the next morning, I mentioned it to the front desk manager, Tiffany. She asked me if I told anyone about the issue and I told her I tried calling but no one answered (I told her it was around 5pm). She said that is a very busy time at the front desk and that I should have tried calling when they weren't busy with people checking in. Her tone and body language was upsetting considering I was just trying to let her know that the TV was broke (and that she should have someone fix it before the next guest arrives). She then went on to tell me that it was my fault for not having the TV fixed and that I should have done something about it earlier. I stay at hotels a lot (Gold Passport Diamond) and have never been treated so rudely. A nice hotel but the management needs a bit more training.

The front desk staff was extremely helpful with subway directions and restaurant suggestions, and had a baggage hold service which we used our last day there.

Ended up on the 25th floor room 2502 due to the amazing client salvaging skills of a very human hotel manager with the name of Charmaine Warren that did the right thing when we were ready to take our bags and move to another hotel. After being on the road for a week we stayed one night and due to a less than firm king bed we could not sleep at all. We were ready to move on due to misunderstandings with the Hyatt guest rewards desk when Charmaine just plain asked what would it take to make us satisfied. We then went to just be tourists in New York. We had no idea when we arrived back to the hotel almost at midnight which room we would be assigned. To our total surprise we got a room in the back of the building, which most reviewers here tend to recommend all to avoid. We got much more than anyone would ever expect out of a hotel room. We got a room with the magical view of an unobstructed Empire State building. Yes, the one that King Kong climbed, the one so tall that a bomber crashed into it.

The location was very convenient for our needs and an easy walk from Penn Station. Downsides were elevators that took a long time to arrive, lots of families with kids crowding the breakfast area, and towels in the otherwise excellent bathroom that would seem more at home at Motel 6 than Hyatt. The exhaust fan in the bathroom was rather anemic. The fitness center was so-so. The Wifi worked flawlessly. We would stay again if this part of the city were our focus.","Annapolis, Maryland, United States","Daniel S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Annapolis, Maryland, United States</strong>",45,4.0
