It would be difficult to manage more than one person and more than one suitcase in this room.The bathroom is great. It’s a traditional Japanese bathroom, so a little larger than you normally find in a Moxy.The night I arrived was just before a Rugby World Cup game in Tokyo, so the lobby bar/common area was packed with people.

If you book directly via Marriott/Moxy, there is the possibility to chat via the Marriot Bonvoy app. At the moxy chat, before Check in, I could chat with the hotel staff to inform them about special wishes etc. The person behind the chat was super attentative and made everything we needed possible. (I.e. special request of high floor, away from elevators, two rooms next to each other). Staff at Check in and Check out was extremely friendly and super helpful. They did everything with enthusiasm and you could feel that they love to make their guests feeling welcome. On the other hand, we made an experience at the bar where they were not really friendly and welcoming.

Even though the room has two beds, it's really only comfortable for one person. The hotel is in a good location, depending on what your plans are. We were able to walk to a few places, but had to use a taxi for most attractions. Everything was always a 20-30 minute taxi ride. A lot of the of our plans were in the Shibuya Station area. If you believe that's where the majority of your travels will take you, you may want to find something closer to that area. If my room were bigger, I would've enjoyed my stay much more. The guest service I received made up for the lack of space in the room. They were very accommodating. Space and location would be the only reason I wouldn't stay at this hotel a second time. If you plan on staying, from pics, it looks like the room with one bed has a bit more space. If you don't mind the limited space and the distance from certain areas, by all means book this hotel. You won't regret it. At least you know the room size. I wish I paid more attention to that, at least I would've been prepared.",Ohio,"callmeRoyalTee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ohio</strong>",16,4.0

Here you are warmly greeted by some-one who looks like a bar manager. Wait a minute! She is a bar manager, because she’s just served you a house specialty cocktail made from local spirits as she asks for your name and checks you in. Simply brilliant!After knocking back your welcome cocktail in your room, you may wish to head down to the well equipped basement gym set in ample space to run off the vodka. In the gym you’ll be greeted by funky flamingos and an assortment of Japanese pop culture figures. This is the same level where the conference rooms are as well.Laundry and ironing facilities are available and easily identified by some very interesting signage and murals. A library, games rooms, eating area and bar are all there too, but be sure to take your mobile or tablet with you as live posts through social media are not only encouraged but almost demanded by the staff.

They serve their purpose with more than comfortable bedding due to the fact that their beds are the real deal.

Join colleagues in the communal seating area for a working lunch, meet with clients or simply relax and enjoy light fare and cocktails. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.Noodle Station and the Deli allows you to “pimp” your noodles 24/7 with a broad selection of noodles and a condiment station to create your own flavours. Grab-and-go food and drinks are available around the clock for early risers and all-night party goers. Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Dress code is casual.Located in Kinshicho means that in terms of atmosphere, it’s more relaxed and – in some places – has a rough-around-the-edges vibe. Kinshicho, together with neighbouring Kameido – one stop east on the Chuo-Sobo line – forms one of Tokyo’s seven official sub-metropolitan centres, or fukutoshin.The area surrounding Kinshicho station is divided into a largely shopping-oriented north and a largely gambling and “love-hotel-oriented” south.

I stayed here because the hotels in the business district were too expensive and it was more cost effective to stay here and pay for an uber to/from the office. The rooms are in keeping with the Moxy brand and very modern, the bed was comfortable and the shower good. The TV is very limited for English channels but that is common across Tokyo (in my experience). The 4-star rating is largely due to the lack of furniture in the room, there is a tiny table and a folding chair which hang on the wall, this made it difficult for me to do any work in the evenings.

It's nothing like the small, cramped, business hotels in Tokyo with only a Queen-size bed, wall-mounted TV, a small table counter, and packaged bathroom. The stylish room was larger with a king-size bed and larger bathroom with walk-in shower, roomier counter/sink and popular Japanese toilet. The front desk staff and the room service staff were all so friendly and polite, as well as professional and efficient. The amenities including wi-fi, TV, air conditioning, etc. were great. I booked a room for 5 nignts, spent one night outside of Tokyo, and returned to the Moxy for an additional 2 nights. For my trip outside of Tokyo, I stored my suitcase in a locker provided by the hotel at no cost and took what I needed for that one day in my backpack. The basement has a small fitness room and laundry room for guests, which I made good use of both during my stay. The hotel is just a ten-minute walk to the Kinshicho JR train station and Metro subway station, which is just fantastic to get you anywhere in Tokyo at a low cost and fast pace. For travelers who understand the Tokyo rail system, and first timers who will become experts, the Kinshicho location is just amazing and a hidden gem that is a well-kept secret. What didn't I like about the Moxy Hotel? It didn't have a small refrigerator in the room, which does make a difference when you want a cold drink after a hot day around Tokyo. But, that isn't enough to rate this hotel lower than 5 stars. A convenience store is just across the street from the hotel and department stores and coffee shops are just a block or two away. For families with children, they should consider that the hotel is in the entertainment district and there are a few bars and short time hotels nearby. As in all of Japan, safety is not an issue. This hotel is better than the other business hotels in Tokyo that I have stayed in, and at the same affordable price.

This brand of hotel is designed for the modern millennial with a chic and unique style everything down to the messages wrote in the lift were great to see and really appealed to me.The person who wrote the review prior saying not a Marriott and not designed for business travellers I would say. If you wanted a business centre and someone to help you with everything you should have stayed at Marriott Tokyo, if you wanted something more modern and trendy this is the right choice. Yes there are bars and red light districts but you will only notice them if you go looking. I didn’t hear any noice or music in my room relating to the local facilities.Breakfast was good and had several American and English selection. I thought the staff were very engaging and were great at assisting with every request and really showed true hospitality. The hotel is away from central Tokyo but right next to a main train and metro terminal meaning you can access all of Tokyo from only a five minute walk from the hotel. If you don’t intend travelling and exploring then this hotel may seem away from city centre but for me the location was perfect. Rooms were clean and well maintained with no defects, air con worked perfectly and bottle water was available in the room and open bar area.

The room is small but as expected similar across all Tokyo hotel standards. Hotel public area is stylish, instagrammable. Room is equipped with a comfortable bed and necessary basic amenities. For what you pay for there will be trade offs such as tea and coffee availability while free is only for the taking downstairs at the cafe bar behind the bar. As for a week full on business trip I find it challenging to utilise the shared ironing board, located one on each floor. It is inconvenience when you have to iron several shirts for the week while other guests may need to use as well. I am all for sharing this facility since most of us use it once awhile but perhaps the hotel should offer individual one as well for those prefer ironing in his or her own room. The time I need to use each morning were usually having to wait for other guests to fining their ironing first but just little inconvenient to wait.The most disappointing gripe that I have however is the location. I'm all for slow walking 10mins from the nearest train station Kinshicho but that 10mins of getting hassles for girls, bars, drinks and more girls along the walk to the hotel is off putting and distasteful. No matter which routes you take, walking from Kinshicho requires you to walk pass men and ladies standing around on streets asking you - think bangkok's seedy area with upper crust respectful Japanese manners (some Japanese and some foreign nationals from South Asia asking you along the way). Unfortunately my verdict is to avoid this hotel in the future for this reason alone and not through the hotel faults except the planning for the hotel ought to consider this aspect. I am told by local friends the area is known for such seedy activities for a long time so I guess Moxy perhaps hoping it will get rejuvenated soon.There are many hotels around the area and as feedback I have read they do provide services charging hourly 1 or 2 stars class.

Location: a short 5 to 7 minutes straightforward walk from Kinshicho train station. The bus station is just next to the train station. Totally manageable with luggage. If you must take a taxi, it will cost about $5. If coming in from Haneda, I'd recommend taking the Keikyu Limo Bus (coach) to the hotel because it's direct and very convenient. Taking the train would require changing trains which could be cumbersome with luggage and figuring out which platform to board trains. The bus is 920Yens vs. 670Yens for train. The convenience is well worth the extra 250Yen (~$2).The area itself is near many ""gentlemen"" clubs. It did not bother us and we did not encounter any problem. In fact, we felt safe walking late at night because there were always people and ""bouncers"" around. There are many restaurants along the walk from the station to the hotel. There is a gyoza restaurant a block from the hotel and the store front has a red awning. Hotel staff told me that it's a great restaurant. I think it's called Komeida Gyoza. I searched it on TA and indeed it has great reviews. Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to try it. Definitely will try it next time. There is a 7-11 and Mini-mart across from the hotel. There are 3 dept stores w/ food departments very near the train station. Check-in: no problem at all. I used mobile check-in and indicated early arrival (1pm). Room was ready. Ms. Meiko Ishii checked us in and she was very professional and helpful. She helped me changed a couple of restaurant reservations which I appreciated very much. The rest of the staff was also helpful. As a Platinum member, I get $10 F&B credit per day per person + a welcome drink.

First the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. Big plus. Great marriott status recognition, easy subway location, fun vibe, stellar design, reasonable pricing and a solid breakfast. We enjoyed our stay here and are big fans with only one draw back that would have made it a 5 star experience. THE SMOKING! The smoking area is right in-front of the entrance so all the cigarette smell just lingers and fills the common areas (including the breakfast area in the morning) and consumes the elevators with a suffocating nicotine smell. I’m honestly really surprised a well run property like this that the first impression is a deep seeded smell of cigarettes. I think they do try to mask it with a scented spray but you cant hide that disgusting stench!***Advice to mgmt, move that smoking station far away from the entrance! If you do that then people can expect a 5 star stay. ***","San Francisco, California","Fearless37804322096</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",113,4.0

There are lots of public working area too and no restaurant is with the hotel, instead, there is a small area selling food like a tuck shop. Reception agent is also a bartender doing all the things for guests. For Marriott elite member we get welcome drink coupon, and we also get $10 F&B credit as amenity. It is actually quite generous as food and beverage there is not expensive.The room looks smart and cool, although it is not spacious. They hang all the furniture on the wall to release more area, what a smart idea! The room is cool and we really like it. The one downside is that my room is facing the highway so it is so noisy during the night time. As we have a back to back stay in the hotel, when we check out we request a room not facing the highway and they give us another room type. We really appreciate that! We use the F&B credit to redeem the cocktail and food, which are super nice too!!! There is no bathtub but the shower head is strong. No brands on the amenities.

And the space is smartly used. All the furniture that you might not need every day is hung on the wall, which makes the room more spacious.The only criticism I have about the hotel is the neighborhood. There are many nightclubs in the area. When the night comes, expect to see men in suits trying to get you into one of the clubs. I have to say it is slightly annoying having to deal with their constant approaching, but I did not feel at any point that I was harassed or in danger. Another smaller problem that I think the hotel can fix is the floor material in the shower, which does not seem to absorb water quickly. I took a shower before I went to bed, and the next morning when I stepped into the shower again, the floor was still wet.I would recommend the hotel to travelers who are looking for a cool, young and vibrant choice of accommodation.

While this is not a full-service type of hotels, it caters to the younger crowd - it is not the best place if you are looking for a family-oriented hotel, but rather very suitable for couples, or those who enjoy the night life. Although the rooms appear small, compared to North American standards, it is reasonable with respect to Asia or European hotels. There is entertainment, special events, etc. on a nightly basis which caters to the younger generation, it also works well for those with a limited budget especially in Tokyo. The location may be somewhat noisier than other areas of town but that is just to be expected given the proximity of the hotel. The rooms are extremely clean and the hotel amenities, public areas and hallways are well-kept. The check-in and check-out process was simple - a nice treat when the check-in staff offered free drink vouchers and small bag containing oral hygiene. The staff are very welcoming, and do make sure that our stay was pleasant throughout. If you are looking for a top class restaurant in this hotel, then you will be disappointed since this hotel does not cater to that, and also there are many good places to eat in the area so, why not? The food at this hotel is for those looking for a quick bite, and simple lunches/dinners. You cannot fault a hotel's catering - just because. We had a small hiccup during checkout due to system malfunction, but the issue was quickly escalated and resolved within a few hours. Appreciated Ms Drescher for tackling the problem quickly.

While the interior design and all the furniture were the same as Moxy Osaka, but the circulation around the beds was very tight. The sound isolation was poor as our sleep was disturbed by traffic noise and boisterous street revelers at night for the first few nights.On the plus side, the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. Rooms are super clean and serviced daily. Hotel facilities included free gym, 24 hours café, large screen TV and free Wifi.

Most of the tourist attractions can be easily reached by train or buses. Shopping malls and restaurant were aplenty within 5 minutes walk as well. There are half dozen ‘Girlie establishments’ nearby with friendly bouncers at door but they are only catered for Japanese clients. We were there for a week from 26th of Dec to 2nd of January. We were surprised that Japan was not into celebrations for New Year Eve. All shopping malls and restaurants closed early. But there was a huge cost penalty on hotel prices and the same for Christmas which was similarly quiet.

Our experience was highly disappointing - given the hotel location's (Red light district and night clubs) you can hear everything going on outside within your room (When asking to see if a higher room was available to try and block out the noise, we were simply told my management to drink more alcohol to send us to sleep!!) so my recommendation would be to only book this hotel if you have no where else to stay and as a very very very last resort!! The walk from the tube station is most unpleasant (A large amount of men and women are in the streets touting for your business for the large amount of 'women clubs' in the vicinity). Whilst we were not approached directly, it was a very worrying experience- which cant be avoided if you want to get to the hotel. This hotel shouldn't be part of the Marriott group so please don't be fooled by the misplacement of advertising. The hotel also plays extremely loud music in the lobby/ drinks area all the time (It was as though they were trying to make themselves 24/7 nightclub also!! )- regardless of what time it is so don't bank on a relaxing coffee/breakfast in the morning or to be able to talk to the person you're actually with.The location of this hotel is its greatest downfall and we did question whether what was happening outside the hotel, was being brought into the hotel. Whilst we didn't experience this directly, a large amount of men/women were always seen round the entrance of the hotel and at the cross roads just before the hotel.The only positive from our stay was that the room was clean.So... please book this hotel with caution!",,Charlotte499,1,1.0

Good amenities in the bathroom (even a hairbrush). Check-in at the bar - which seems weird at first, but it's actually fairly practical and efficient. The location is 2 blocks from the metro station and there's a 2-stop rapid train into Tokyo station. On one day, I walked to the Senso-ji temple and it was about a 30 minute walk, but it was a good stroll through neighborhoods & a park, so if the weather is nice, it was a very pleasant walk (used Google Maps).Staff spoke good english, so that wasn't a problem as I don't speak Japanese (other then hello and thank you).

I've never really considered the checkin process to hold much weight. They are almost always very good. However things were different here. To be fair as possible I have categorised my reasons. Note the score above is probably for youth wanting to stay in a hip and budget solution. Check-inWe arrived from a long trip from Hiroshima so were pretty exhausted. I'd booked this as it was owned by Marriott and with my status I usually get really good service along with the late checkout that I needed for this trip.The checking in was strange. It is done in the bar area and it doesn't really work. It did not help that I had the worst check in I have ever encountered. This was solely due to the hotel staff who checked me in. This was the first person who was of non Japanese descent to check us in and that famous Japanese hospitality was immediately lost. I mentioned that I spoke to the hotel staff yesterday to make a correction to my booking. He agreed this had been done (I mentioned the time and he was able to work out the staff member I spoke too). However he was not willing to accept the conversation happened on the phone the way I described it. I said fair enough lets ask the guy I spoke to. If there was a misunderstanding then Ill accept it. This is where things got weird. He said that would not be fair on the staff member. What??? He would rather offend a lifetime Marriott member then simply ask the staff his recollection of the conversation. Even worse he decided to inform me what the staff member was trying to say - and of course it was a very different interpretation to mine. He then lectured me on Japanese customs and told my mother when she asked about the vegetarian breakfast option that customers had expectations that were too high. His performance was abysmal and rude it was this that spurred me to make a formal complaint. Very un-Marriot like too. When I have issues before the hotel staff were the ones making it better. Here he made it worse.His boss was very good. She seemed gracious and understanding and wrote us a nice letter. RoomsSmall and very hip. There are no tables or chairs set up. They are folded on the wall and you have to set them up. Rooms are small so if you do it eats into the space. Great lighting and controls all easily accessible. Big issue for Japan though is no refrigerator. Bathroom Small but great shower. BreakfastNot good - skip it unless you like very badly made food.LocationIts in the red light district which took me by surprise. To my relief it was generally safe but it gets noisy and I would still take precautions. 5-8mins to major rail and subway lines and close to the SkyTree (15-20mins walk).StaffI have commented on the checkin staff person. However it is not fair on the other staff who were great. At night one helped me ring for a takeaway and at breakfast another help me track down a few tracks that I liked. The Director of Operations was pleasant, seemed to get it and helped in my mind partially make up for her checkin staff person. OverallOne for the younger generation I believe. The check in process was abysmal but I have scored it based on what I think the youth would want. Personally I would never stay here again.","London, United Kingdom","amohanty90</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",17,3.0

The rooms are big, for Tokyo standards, and the bathroom is excellent for the size of the room and the showers are amazing. If we should ask for something then it would be some kind of storage in the room. Either more hangers or, perhaps, drawers under the bed (seen that in some other places that has limited space)..

So you can get to basically anywhere in Tokyo in about 30 minutes.One small downside was our rooms placement which was right across from apartments with balconies so we went with drawn blinders all week (didn't do much difference since it was raining most days).

We enjoyed our stay and the staff played into that heavily. They were all very friendly and great to talk to when we were at the bar. It's worth noting that the drinked and food served were really good and priced well. From check in to check out we had no problems with the hotel. While the area can be a bit sketchy at night, during the day everything is perfectly fine.Starting with the rooms, small but really well organized. So it's a long hallway when you first walk in, but that's because the bathroom takes up a whole front corner. At the back of the room is your bed. Tucked into this small space perfectly. The window has a large sil that you can use as additional storage, especially when the curtain is pulled down. There's a folding chair and table handing on wall you can take down to use when you want to at something that's not your bed. there's a sort of brown leather lounger chair by one side of the bed. While it was pretty comfortable and we did use it a lot, it does make the space a but more cramped. Thinking about cleanliness, everything was spotless and stayed this way day to day. Seriously, very clean.I loved the bathroom. A great toilet, large vanity, space to move, and a wonderful shower. It has great pressure and both a rainshower head and shower wand. One thing is you'll need to step up into the shower. And I mean up... it's a bit off the ground, probably for the plumbing. It's not THAT big a leap, maybe like 6 inches.I got breakfast with my stay and it was pretty good. There wasn't a huge variety and it was the same day to day but all the food was fresh and filling. I loved the little cheeses. There's a small gym in the basement that I didn't get a chance to make use of but all the equipment was need and working as far as I could see. I did make use of the laundry room which was a saviour. Not super expensive but the dryer does take multiple runs usually. Just make sure to check the lint trap before starting, it makes a huge difference. While it does dispense its own soap, you'll likely want to add some of your own. Overall, we had a great stay at the Moxy. The staff were a big part of our enjoyment and I want to thank all of them for your help and kindness. If I'm back in town this is my first lookup for a place to stay. The price couldn't be beat for a similar experience.

To find such a good place in Tokyo that is extremely good value is rare. In Moxy Kinshicho I found it. From the moment you walk in, it is a friendly place. Anna and her staff are welcoming. There is music playing throughout which automatically gives you a great feeling. If you haven't stayed at a Moxy ( by Marriott ) before, it is a reduced service model, but that doesn't mean much because it is very friendly service. Reception doubles up as part of the bar and with a friendly greeting, a cold beer to welcome me, and off to the room. I was given a room on 8th floor. Rooms in Tokyo ( Japan ) are particularly small. This was no exception. But better than most I have stayed. The bathroom is ample, with nice water pressure, a nice big vanity unit and hot water! Great. I had a queen bed room, the bed was all new fresh linen, a good size and very easy to sleep in. ie; comfort +The air-conditioning is excellent. You control your own. And have it as cold or as warm as you like. Bloody fantastic. One of the features of Moxy branded hotels is no desks in the room. I understand why they do this, they want to encourage a community spirit in the common areas. But to be honest, this is a feature I am not enthralled about. I am as social as the next guy, but when I am working or just socialising online, sometimes I prefer to do it in my own space. So if there was one thing that would stop me from booking Moxy again, this would be it. ( But it's not a complaint, I know this is the model for Moxy and I booked this time knowing they have no desks in the rooms ). But for me, there are more reasons for staying, than not. Like the wi-fi. Very fast, tested at 40MbpsI never experienced the in-house restaurant or breakfast because you are in a great local neighborhood. 95% of the people you will see are local Japanese folks and I love it. There are literally hundreds of bars and restaurants within walking distance so your options are almost overwhelming. And it's within walking distance to Kinshicho Station where you can access transport, either JR or Keikyu Limousine Bus to HND or NRT. I did experience the bar. And it's very funky music. And the guys are very friendly. Make sure you have a beer with Jazz, a really interesting fella from New York who's living and working in Tokyo. And it's a 24 hour bar. So if you have travelled a long way to get here and suffering jetlag and feel like a beer at 4 in the morning because it still 8 pm where you have come from, you can. What's not to love about a 24 hour Bar. Summary: Has to be one of the best value hotels in Tokyo for my liking. Good local neighborhood, very friendly team and a-c that works for you! Hallelujah! And very fast wifi. And if you're a Marriott member, you'll pick up a few points along the way. This place is not for you if you like all the bells and whistles, the expensive flowers in reception and lots of white gloves, but if you want good value for money, you've found it. Would I recommend: In a heartbeat.Would I stay again: Yes. I am.","Negombo, Sri Lanka","robdubluu</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Negombo, Sri Lanka</strong>",138,4.0

Around 2:26 am my mom called me:”someone just opened my room! Due to the locked chain across the door, he couldn’t able to walk in. Thus he kept pushing the door loudly and woked me up. I saw his hand reaching inside trying to unlock. I shouted “who is it!” No replied and he just ran away.”I called the front desk around 2:50 am. The staff said:” Sorry and thank you for telling me this information. I don’t know what happened but I will go to you floor to check.”This morning, we all pulled down our luggages to eat breakfast since knowing our rooms weren’t safe. I told the front desk what happened last night again and a staff said, “I was on duty whole night but I didn’t get any phone call.” Unbelievable, was I talking to ghost? I asked them to check the security camera to see who was trying to enter my mom’s room. The staff agreed and said that he would give me an explanation and wanted to give me free coffee as compensation. But I told him that “This is not a problem about free coffee, it’s about safety, the simplest thing a hotel should provide.”After breakfast, he told me that “It was our staff that tried to enter the room. Because you checked in before 12 pm yesterday, and our system showed your room was empty. Our staff need to check empty room. Sorry for the scaring. It is a big problem and we will have more staff training.”I said, “why didn’t he stay and explain to my mom? He just ran away! It was very scaring we would think it’s a thief! “ My mom asked, “Which staff? Tell me the name.” He said, “we need to confirm.” Obviously, he lied to us. If it was system error, then the staff would check my room as well, but no one tried to open my door last night at “2 A.M.”I am truly angry that Moxy’s front desk want me to believe that it was a system error and staff training problem. But I think it is much more serious if you don’t tell your customers the truth. That it could be the thief who wanted to break in my room and stole worthy inside.LIE TO YOUR CUSTOMERS and try to distract to other aspects is more serious than a thief gets in moxy hotel, which means, this incident will happen again and again. I’m writing this not because I want to get any compensation in this terrified experience. As a customer, a parent and a loyalty Marriott Platinum member, I need to know how the hotel managing safety problems and how to fix it if something went wrong during their customer stay. My friend told me Kotobashi, the Tokyo moxy located, isn’t a safe area. He won’t choose any hotels there. Well, how do I know Moxy Tokyo is located in an unsafe area? How do I know someone can get in and open the room so easily? Since I didn’t get a good explanation from Moxy, the only thing I can do is sharing the horrible experience public. Someone told me this could happen in either JW Marriott even in Ritz Carton as well. Thus, remember to bring your passport and money every anytime and locked the door chain every night. Keep safe!2018.7.21-22住東京錦糸町Moxy，遇到超恐怖事件與大家分享。半夜兩點半剛好兒子起床上廁所，看到5分鐘前有媽媽的未接來電。住同層樓的媽媽說：「有人開我房門，還好我有上扣，他就一直撞門，我被吵醒起來看，看他手都伸進來想要開門，我問是誰，人就跑掉了。」媽媽嚇得不敢睡，怕我也遇到一樣的事，趕快打電話提醒我，門要反鎖還要扣上。我當下打去櫃檯，櫃檯說抱歉，他會去那層樓巡視，不知道為何會有此事，謝謝你告訴我。今早我們想說小偷可以這麼輕易進房間，就把行李通通都拉到一樓吃早餐，以免行李被拉走。再度跟櫃檯說此事，一名看似是小主管的日本人說，他值班了整夜，沒有接到電話。（是鬼接的嗎！）我要求日本人查看監視器，他說好，也有說很抱歉，問我要不要喝咖啡作為補償。我說不用，我想知道發生什麼事情，這實在太恐怖了，身為會員，我必須要知道我以後還能不能再住你們飯店。他說他現在去了解原因。吃完早餐後，他說要跟我解釋這一起事件：「是人員疏失，因為你們中午前check in沒有進系統，因此系統顯示為空房間。工作人員晚上要逐一檢查空房間，很抱歉我們會加強人員訓練。」我說，有哪個工作人員會開門，發現有反扣還一直撞門，客人問是誰，也不留下來跟客人好好解釋，而是直接跑掉？我媽氣死了，問他是哪一個工作人員，他不說是誰，只說他要再確認。我完全不相信他說的。如果工作人員要檢查空房間，那為什麼沒有檢查我的？電梯需要房卡感應，進門也需要房卡，哪個工作人員會三更半夜檢查空房間，客人問是誰還跑掉！我猜他應該是心想，人員疏失問題總比飯店安全問題小，但我認為跟客戶說謊就是大問題，表示同樣問題會重複發生。由於獲得的理由超爛，飯店只打算請咖啡裝沒事，要趕飛機也沒辦法留下來看監視影像，我只好寫出來提醒大家。達人朋友告訴我錦糸町，新宿東口、池袋、板橋、龜戶都不安全，儘量不要住在這些地方。哩程社團的社友說，就算住五星級飯店也會發生這種事情。提醒大家不管住哪裡，房門必須扣上，必須反鎖（如果有），不要把錢財護照留在房間。","Taipei, Taiwan","CecilyP25</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",63,1.0

Best thing to do is to have a map for Tokyo downloaded or have some type of data service for you to use Google Maps, it's worth the investment.

They have salads, bacon, eggs, potatoes, pancakes, etc... but grab a bowl of Ramen. Not the best Ramen in Japan, but will give you something hot in the morning if you like it.

The beds, sheets, and pillows were comfortable.About the location......this was our first stay in Japan and we were really jet-lagged so we didn't go out at night. We did notice, though, that there were a couple of go-go bars nearby, but they were fairly discreet and the neighborhood was very clean, and I'm under the impression that this wasn't an issue at all. There was a mall nearby with several restaurants in it. It is very close to the train station (about 2 blocks), so this was super convenient.

Decor is cute & modern. Cleanliness - Super clean, everywhere you look including public areas. Hotel sheets and towels are bright white, looked brand new.Rooms - While the rooms are tiny (typical for Tokyo), they are very functional. That’s right, not even a closet; they have pegs on the wall and a cabinet. We made it work. Super comfy bed, like a cloud. The room rates are very reasonable but keep in mind we had to get 2 rooms for 4 people (this will apply to a lot of other hotels too).Staff - Every person we talked to was helpful, polite and professional. I was worried about the bar checkin (we’re a family of 4) and the loud DJ parties. Don’t worry, in fact it was one of the most efficient checkins I’ve ever experienced. After we checked out the hotel called me thinking I forgot something but it was another guest’s.Here’s why I took off a star:Breakfast - The breakfast is actually a good value for the cost (we added it to our room rate via Expedia @$8 PP). It included the Japanese staples, mini waffles & pancakes (these were not refilled often), yummy breads, fruit, yogurt, good coffee and a variety of juices. The issue is that while breakfast hours are 6:30 AM - 10:30 AM, there’s almost nothing left, not even cups starting around 9:30 AM. That’s unacceptable.Safe - There was no safe in the room which meant I was walking around with our passports all day in my handbag.Location - First, hotel is literally 3 blocks from the metro & JR station. While it’s not right in the more touristy areas, it’s very convenient to Disney so it was a good compromise. Across the street from our side of the hotel there is a convenience store and every other night, there was such a LOUD group hanging out there for hours. Not the hotel’s fault, but something to consider.","Fort Worth, Texas","di2fly37k</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Worth, Texas</strong>",20,4.0

(There are lots of solicitors hoping to lure male customers; they will not bother women or male-female couples.).The guest rooms tend to be on the smallish side but the bathroom has a reasonably sized shower with great water pressure. To make up for the lack of space in the room, there are plenty of public spaces — the bar/cafe , living room area and library. The 24 hour fitness room in the basement has all the equipment for a basic workout. There is a laundromat on the same floor.The breakfast does not offer much variety but the quality was very good. I was actually glad I chose the rate that came with breakfast due to the scarcity of places offering breakfast within the vicinity of the hotel. One of Tokyo’s ubiquitous convenience stores is located across the street. Lots of local eateries can be found around Kinshicho station.

First time visitors will probably be turned off about the Kinshicho area. It's not touristy, it's local. No one here will make a big deal of you, Mr and Mrs Western Tourist. Walking to the hotel is a challenge of your ability to read a map. Here's the easy way. Walk out of the train station, through the plaza, toward the main street. Turn right down the main street. When you come across a 7-11, turn left and walk down three blocks. The hotel is across the street from a Mini-Stop. There. You've just navigated like a local. And the area you walked through is full of yakatori bars, restaurants, clubs and bars. And contrary to some of the reviews posted here, just because there are young and attractive women hawking for bars and clubs DOES NOT MAKE THEM PROSTITUTES. Once you get to the hotel, the first question is ""where is the front desk""? You enter the hotel and on the right is a lounge area and the left is the bar and tables. Go to the bar and check in. Also get yourself a drink or a snack. I recommend the wall o'instant noodles. Breakfast is also served here. The staff here is different from other western hotel chains. The Moxy took great pains to hire staff who are fluent in English and have a personality. Excellent! Despite this being part of Marriott, this is NOT a full service hotel. Think of this as more of a business hotel with an edge. If you want water, drink out of the tap. If you want it in a bottle, run across the street to Mini Stop. This isn't a typical western hotel where you can gorge yourself on lounge food and take home a dozen water bottles. You'll see what I mean about business hotels when you see the room. The rooms are decorated well, with a combination of wood and industrial style. There is no closet but rather there are hangers on the wall. Along with a chair and folding table. And the TV. The beds are excellently firm and have warm poofy duvets (I visited last December as winter was arriving). Unlike Japanese business hotels with their plastic bathrooms, the bathrooms here were nice, The rooms here are roomy for one, crowded for two. If you're here with a significant other, it's fine. If you're here with a travel buddy, you'll want to get separate rooms. It's that tight. The staff was fantastic in accommodating us when we decided that we needed a second room. Easy peasy which it isn't always in Tokyo. And one of the staff, Kei (who spent time in Georgia during University) went out of his way to walk the two of us to an excellent yakuniku place near the train station. He didn't have to but he did. Thanks! The Moxy has a lot of things going for it for experienced travelers. Regular Tokyo visitors don't necessarily need to be in the heart of it. Roppongi, Shinjuku and Shibuya are great spots to hang out in but have ridiculously expensive lodging. At the same time, if you've been to Tokyo before, you don't have to subject yourself to the backpacker ghetto in Taito-Ku either. The Moxy is close to a major train station, there's local places to eat and hang out, it's staffed by fun and knowledgeable Edokko and there's a coin laundry in the basement. Just thought I'd mention that last bit, because that's where you'll meet fellow travelers.","San Francisco, California","rodneyl281</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",1,5.0

We flew into Narita and got the Narita Express to Tokyo, then back-tracked along the same line the short distance to Kinshicho station. If you have a Japan rail pass, make sure you get the JR train to Kinshicho, as it is included in the scheme.From the station, it is s short, easy walk to the hotel. We were a little early, it was only 1300, we checked in okay and were given a very nice room 1002 on the top floor of 10. We were also given some free drinks vouchers and four breakfast vouchers for our two day stay. Moxy hotels are a fairly new concept, allegedly ‘trendy’ and designed for millennials, but are a lot cheaper than the traditional full service Marriotts, or even the Courtyards. We were a little unsure what to expect because Tokyo is renowned for its small hotel rooms. I have to say we were very impressed; the room has a big bed and a large bathroom with shower, lots of plug points and nice touches like amenity kits, water and slippers. There are collapsible chairs, luggage rack and a table hung on the wall to maximise space and even the phone is an old fashioned, push button quirky thing. Another nice touch is a motion activated light under the bed that gives a bit of light if you need to get up in the night. The area around the hotel could probably best be described as a 'Red Light' area with lots of clubs and other adult venues. This didn't cause us the slightest problem - there was no noise pollution from the clubs, and none of the 'adult activities' impacted on us in any way. Breakfast is buffet style with tin mugs, plates and utensils. They had sausage, eggs and bacon plus ramen done to order, as well as granola, yoghurt and fruit.The staff we encountered all seemed to fit the young and trendy demographic, but were all very helpful and friendly.There are lots of restaurants, bars and shops in the immediate area, and the proximity to Kinshicho station makes it a perfect base for any visitor to Tokyo.We recommend the hotel wholeheartedly , and will certainly return next time we are in Tokyo.","Ravenshead, United Kingdom","Nick_Harris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ravenshead, United Kingdom</strong>",205,5.0

From the moment you arrive at the front door you can feel your in for a unique experience, unlike anything I’ve seen in Japan before! Check in is completed at the bar by extremely friendly staff which are either Japanese or foreigners so no need to worry about a language barrier! Within the same area there is also a large lounge with some hip music playing and various old school games laying around the tables, the also offer daily events that interact with staff or fellow guests!On the opposite side to this there is a library / meeting room for a quieter hang out space but personally I enjoyed sitting in the lounge to chill out with some loud music whilst working away!The rooms are made to feel quiet large due to the unnecessary items being hang on the wall such as a table, chair, luggage rack etc. The bathroom has the largest walk in shower I’ve seen in Tokyo for a long time with the most strongest hot water, something that’s hard to come by in hotels!!Now let’s go to the bed! Anyone that has travelled Japan a lot comes to expect a hard rock, but not at Moxy!!! The sleep I had last night was like sleeping on a cloud with the most softest pillows, I only wish I didn’t have business meetings today so that I could of slept longer!! The only negative of the room is there is no fridge but it honestly doesn’t matter considering there is a mini stop and 7/11 adjacent to the hotel.The location is only a short walk to Kinshicho station which provides easy access to pretty much everywhere within Tokyo. Some maybe worried about the location being within a red light district but honestly there’s nothing to worry about, some hotels in Shinjuku would be in a worse location!! Finally a big high five to the Blonde woman (Sorry I couldn’t see a name badge) who I am guessing is the manager. She made sure to acknowledge every person she came in contact with, along with wishing myself to have a good day! This is something I completely didn’t expect and it was so nice to feel genuine service!! If your looking for a 5 Star boring luxury experience then this hotel isn’t for you, but if your after an exciting enjoyable experience give this property and crew a go, I promise you won’t be disappointed!!!

We booked our reservation online and headed directly over to at least drop off our luggage until check out. When we first arrived we explained that we were switching hotels and the staff were able to find us a room for an early check in right away with little to no notice. The hotel had a great vibe and the staff were very helpful. Our room was fantastic, well designed, and had everything we needed. We decided to cancel our other reservations in Tokyo and stay at the Moxy for our last five days in Tokyo; not because of the location or fantastic amenities and design of the hotel, but because the staff made us feel so welcome. We were told we may have to switch rooms in order to stay the extended days, which was fine with us. However, the staff was able to reshuffle reservations and keep us in our first room for the full 5 nights.The staff are from all over the globe, and we had a chance to get to know some of them. We could really tell that they enjoyed their work and genuinely were interested in meeting us. We felt as though we were making friends at the hotel. My partner got sick and the operations manager, Anne D., went above and beyond in helping us out. Allowing me to make meals to bring back to my sick partner, helping me in getting the food to the room, and offering assistance in finding cold remedies/pharmacies etc. in the neighborhood. The next day she checked in on us to make sure he was feeling better. The staff/bartenders Kei, Jasmine, and a gentleman from Bali whose name I cannot remember, also were amazing. We discussed Japan, the US, and where they had been. They offered us suggestions on things to see in Tokyo, and they even learned how to make my favorite cocktail and always had one ready to go when I came in for a drink.Our next trip is to Spain, and Anne D. has told us that there is a Moxy in Barcelona. That is where we will be staying! The Moxy Tokyo's staff makes you feel as comfortable as if you were staying at a long time friend's house, while the hotel provides the upscale amenities of a 5-star hotel.

While the hotel is relatively new (opened in Nov 2017) and the initial reviews were mixed, I have to say that we had an absolutely great time at this hotel for the 4 nights we were here. The place had such a neat vibe. It smelled amazing in the lobby, the check in counter was at the bar (which happens to be open 24/7). Breakfast was amazing. There's board games and a foosball table in the lobby. All the gym equipment was new. We stayed in standard rooms, and the rooms were surprisingly spacious for a hotel in Japan. As an SPG member that usually stays at SPG properties, it honestly felt like I was staying at a smaller, more homely W hotel, when looking at the modern decor and design. Service from everyone I interacted with was fantastic, with a special shout out to Khalif who gave us some great local food recommendations. While the location is in a bit of a red light district, the girls in our group felt safe walking alone at night (it is Japan after all), and the hotel is a 5 min walk from a major JR rail train station. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by our stay and I definitely want to experience other Moxy hotels in the future.

I have stayed in many different hotels and areas in Tokyo, but was curious to see what Marriott was offering at the MOXY. Although very different from other hotels in Japan and other Marriotts, I was very pleased with my experience there. From the time I entered the hotel, I was greeted by two friendly and enthusiastic team members; Asami san and Maiko san. I have a firm belief that if employees enjoy working in a place, the customers will enjoy their experience. I had a very interesting conversation with the Director of Operations, Anne (who was ready available and very visible) who helped me to understand some of the concepts and challenges that they have been experiencing since opening this MOXY in Tokyp My room at the MOXY was larger than other hotel rooms in Tokyo, very clean with a comfortable bed and bathroom. The amenities were at a minimum, but still able to provide everything I needed for my stay. I had many opportunities to smile while I was there and would happily stay there again, if the opportunity presents it self.

There are no staff in white gloves popping out to grab your bags or open doors for you at this property. Staff, however, are incredibly helpful and I enjoyed the friendly, more casual service.The room was fantastic, and probably the best laid out one I have seen in Japan. It didn't have a closet, but I found using the wall pegs hanging clothes to be far more convenient. Bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was great. Room was considerably larger than those found in typical, more expensive Japanese properties.The hotel's breakfast buffet had western options that tasted far better than those I have found at expensive Japanese hotels. The dining area is nice, busy, social and informal--just the way I like it. Again, if you want white glove service, look elsewhere. Staff worked very hard and did a great job of keeping things stocked and fresh.The hotel has a gym that is free of charge to use. This, in my experience, is unusual in Japan. Another real convenience is the hotel's coin laundry area--spotlessly clean, and simple to use.The property's location is convenient. There are plenty of stores and restaurants in the area, but if you aren't exactly right in the middle of things where Tokyo's shopping or tourist attractions are concerned. JR Kinshicho station is about a 5-minute walk from the hotel, so getting around is easy.If you want to stay in the middle of Shibuya, Shinjuku or Ginza, you'll pay a lot more for a smaller, less comfortable room with far fewer conveniences.

I stay at Marriott properties whenever possible. It's about consistency and perks, obviously. The motivations that led me to stay at this property in Tokyo were the same ones that led me to stay at the Moxy in Manhattan back in the Fall. Fortunately, this property is much better than the one in NYC. I almost didn't stay here because of how bad the New York experience was, but this one was all right. Considering that breakfast was included here (basically mandatory for a Tokyo hotel in this price range) unlike my awful NYC experience was already a point in this Moxy's favour. The room was big for this price range in Tokyo, which is good. The washroom was well equipped. It is not a Japanese unit bath, which is good. I was looking for a hotel that offered that. Even some of the ""higher end"" Marriotts in Tokyo have unit baths, so a modern offering was welcome. But the positives extended beyond that. The linens were what I would expect from any hotel (much less a Marriott) in that they were 100% cotton (the linens in NYC were a poor poly/cotton blend which made for a poor experience). The shower water pressure was excellent. The toiletries on offer were excellent.I also had a great chat with the staff in both English and Japanese. They even have some non-Japanese staff on rotation. Be warned that this location is not exactly family friendly. If you are oblivious to what is going on around you, or you return to your hotel before nighttime its fine, but otherwise know that this is essentially an active red light district. It's as safe as anywhere else in Japan, basically, but it's still worth mentioning. I would personally not stay here if I was on business, opting instead for something with a more formal feel (and a desk in the room) but it was just fine for my 4-day vacation getaway. However, as I have already alluded to, it was infinitely better than the same brand experience I had in NYC (at 2-3x the price) a few months earlier.My overall recommendation is to consider this property, even if you have an aversion to the brand thanks to the poor experience in NYC (or elsewhere). If you are not a Marriott Gold or Platinum member you will enjoy basically the same experience as I did since they offer nothing in the way of upgrades or lounged, etc. If you are a status member then late checkout etc. still apply. If you are budget conscious and want a Western name-brand hotel you can't go wrong, but if you are budget conscious I would suggest a Japanese brand such as APA or 'The b Hotel' by Isshin instead.","Toronto, Canada","A7101QT</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",2,4.0

I wanted to try this new brand in Tokyo, Japan. This was not the hotel for me. While I see that it is meant for the budget young customer, there are some aspects that that i can never accept. Check in was done at the bar on a Saturday with a DJ and very loud music. I could not hear what the associates were saying. The rooms are very small which was OK as per the style of the hotel but no closets you will need to hand your clothes on the wall as was a small table, chair, etc. There is no room for more than a small carry on. Breakfast was awful. Food was scarce and felt like you were lining up for a ""MASH"" type food on a metal plate. On one of the choices you ca get was a tablespoon of scrambled egg, mashes potatoes, tablespoon of spinach and two small sausage links and if you are a bit late you get only one. For the 3 nights we were there, sliced bread was as rare as gold. On checking out they could store aure larger bags, but was asked to use the lockers for the smaller bags.While the idea of a hostel type hotel with laundry in the basement, ironing room in each floor, is good there are some aspects of this brands that I will never accept.","Thiruvananthapuram District, India","UniversalTraveler58</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Thiruvananthapuram District, India</strong>",5,2.0

Yes there are some local bars that are more colorful than usual, a part of Tokyo we may not have seen... But still very clean and safe. Minor ways to improve: a couple English television channels would be nice...

I’ve stayed at a lot of boutique hotels and actually prefer them over he standard “chain” type hotels (even though I know this is part of the Marriott group) because they have more character and charm.With that being said, the hotel far exceeded my expectations especially for the price. The beds were just as comfortable as your usual Marriott bed. The staff is super friendly and nice. They were very accommodating and personable. I think that’s what I have liked the most. The decor is really cute and I love it. The beds were comfortable and the room layout is enough for my travel needs. I saw on other review sites that some people had issues with the location because it is in the “red light district.” They must be very conservative people because the occasional doormen/ladies standing in doorways trying to bring in customers didn’t bother me at all and I never felt a sense of danger walking there. It is in a brightly lit area. I’m a woman in my late 30s and I never felt in danger. I even came home late past midnight on some nights and I still didn’t have any issues or feel I was in a dangerous situation. Definitely will be back here because of it has everything I need/want in a hotel and at the price point I want. The laundry downstairs was also a huge plus as were the staff. They were all so knowledgeable and nice and down to earth. Yes, I understand the frustrations of Marriott members who expect certain perks they usually get, but they should read the description and stay at the other Marriott in Shinagawa if they want their perks. To judge this hotel because it is a Moxy brand/line with limited perks versus a Marriott/Marriott just isn’t fair.

That 3-4-2 address is worthless. The JR Rail Pass office at the airport told us to take the Rapid JR line on (I think) track 2 to Kinshicho station, direct. No change or transfer. That way we avoided the main Tokyo station and a transfer. When you leave the station from the South exit, cross that main street, walk 1/2 block to the right and then turn left. Walk two blocks and the Moxy will be on the far corner. My friend had it all on the GPS on his phone. It is a 20-minute walk, not 10. You check in at the bar! On duty was Kei (pronounced K) who went to high school in Alabama. Good English! The hotel is new. Everything is new. The new pillows need to be worn down a bit. Our twin beds struck me as being 3/4 beds, which existed in the 1950s. Wider than a twin but narrower than a double. They do not use fitted sheets. The bottom sheet was small and the top sheet was big, making for a messy bed. I asked for additional bed covers. Never got them. The key-making machine was broken for two days. Once the machine was repaired, they could not find me in the computer by room number. They demanded way too much ID from me. The neighborhood is full of ""girlie"" clubs, hostess clubs. ""Touts"" on the sidewalks. 7-11 is across the street. The ""rain"" shower is in a big glass ""closet"" which holds in the steam. Learn the controls! Breakfast is a noodle menu.

I had already read the previous reviews and done my research so I was prepared for the experience - which could be very different if you didn't do so. The hotel is a short 10 minute walk from the train station (Kinshicho) and was actually a direct train ride from NRT airport. It was about an hour and a half train ride. Actually, the train system is Tokyo is wonderful and can basically get you anywhere you need to go. The Kinshicho station was one of the major stops. Upon arrival at the hotel, you have to check in at the bar. That didn't bother us at all as we still received the same great service we usually receive from Marriott. The area around the bar is laid out with games and other entertainment and is also connected to the sit down food area. We didn't eat in the hotel, so I can't really comment on the food offerings. However, the food appeared to be standard Japanese style offerings, with some sprinklings of conventional breads, pastries and yogurts.Our room was located on the 9th floor. I was surprised to see that we had a wonderful unobstructed view of the Tokyo Skytree from there. That was an unexpected treat. The room was laid out nicely, with a very comfortable bed. I'm not sure if the room was considered big or small by Tokyo standards, as this was my first visit, but it definitely served its purpose - which was minimal furnishings (no closet, but hooks on the wall to hang belongings and a table that could be hung on the wall when not in use to avoid taking up space). As others have stated, there is no refrigerator or safe in the room. That can potentially be a downside if you are used to having these items. However, we made it through without a problem. The bathroom was really nice, had adequate space and a wonderful shower and toilet.The area surrounding the hotel has a few convenient stores a number of bars and restaurants. As others have stated, it did appear to be a red light district at night, but it was nothing that would make you feel unsafe. In fact, we never had any issue with being approached and had no problem walking around at any time of night.All in all, we had a wonderful time at the MOXY and really liked the new concept hotel. The staff was wonderful, always helpful and greeted us with a smile. We would definitely stay here again if we were ever to return to Tokyo.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","STBledsoe</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",16,5.0

Very spartan rooms that are new, clean, and efficient. No closets in the room I had.

The staff and services are ""Japanese Rigid"" but they were fun and tried to be as hip as those cats could be.One observation is that the crowd they seem to be targeting, the 20-30 YO's are not the majority of guests there. Most had silver tops and a grumpy I've traveled too much look in their eye. Something tells me the rates they would have to charge to attract that crowd is a real bargain for the road warriors in Tokyo. So there is that....I cant say much about the area as I walked out the south entrance of the train station. Took a right, walked to the light, crossed the street, and strolled up two blocks to the hotel tugging luggage and that was that.

It was my first stay at a Moxy property. I am a Tokyo resident and have stayed in numerous properties in and around Toyko. I am a Marriott Platinum member, so write this review from that perspective. With hesitation and depending on my travel situation, I would stay at this property again.This is Marriot’s newest foray into the Tokyo hotel market, having just opened on 1 November. It definitely still had that new hotel smell. For the uninitiated, Moxy is Marriott’s pairing with Swedish furniture marker IKEA in an effort to target the millennial, hipster travel market. Once you take one step onto the property, you can definitely feel that is the case. Location: The property is located a few minutes’ walk from Kinshicho Station, a major train station that services both JR and Metro train lines. It is convenient to getting anywhere in Tokyo, and just a few stops away from popular areas like Akihabara. There are plenty of restaurants nearby the station, and directly next to the property. There are two convenience stores directly adjacent to the hotel, along with a dry cleaners a short walk down the road (ask a Japanese staff member). As a prior resident of Tokyo, I had never been to Kinshicho before, but found that there was plenty to do in the evening after returning to the hotel. The area nearby the hotel does feature an abundance of bars and night life spots designed to attract a male crowd, and you may be asked while walking in the evening if you are interested in massage services (happened several times to me). Just say no and keep walking, you really aren’t in any danger in this neighborhood. Overall, a great location for all intents and purposes.Facilities: The hotel features a basement gym with all new equipment. I made use of the treadmill a couple of times while staying there. It also has a machine piece that lets you do pull ups, has a punching bag, etc. There is also a (huge plus) laundry room in basement with very reasonable prices. The washing machines dispense their own detergent directly into the laundry load, so there is no need to worry about that. The wash was 300 JPY per load, and the dryer was 100 JPY per 30 minutes. I recommend 60 minutes for an average size load, as my clothes tended to still be slightly damp after an hour of drying. This was a great plus for those staying more than a few days. The first floor features a very ‘hipster’ lounge set up with open seating, games on the tables, and a foosball machine. There is also a 24-hour bar (!) with reasonably priced drinks (small beer was 480 JPY). The intent seemed to be to get guests to mix and socialize with each other. I tended not to have any energy at the end of the day for this, but it seemed like there were always a few people milling around.Rooms: Rooms are a bit smaller compared to your average tourist hotel in Tokyo. They get around this a bit by making all of the furniture hangable. It took me a minute to realize it upon entering the room, but there are pegs along the wall which features a collapsible desk, chairs, and luggage rack. If you don’t need them, then you don’t have to use them and they don’t take up space. The bathroom featured a Japanese style bidet and a strong, hot shower. The thought the bed was very comfortable, and the internet was fast and dependable. The air circulation on the floor and in the room seemed a little weak, but maybe that is something they could tweak as they adjust past their opening. You won’t get much of a view from your room as it is surrounded mostly by buildings. I had a look into a residential building within feet of my window, so mostly kept my curtain closed. Two negatives to the rooms. The biggest negative is that the rooms do not have a safe in them. I have not seen this in a long while. They definitely need to put small safes in the room, and have space to do so. This was an inconvenience for me during my stay. There was also no refrigerator, which was frustrating. If you don’t plan on spending loads of time in your room (which you shouldn’t when touring in Tokyo), then the room will mostly meet your needs (minus the safe and fridge).Staff: Friendly and helpful. They seemed to be the strongest part of the property. They definitely had that new hotel opening energy to them. There are English speaking staff on the clock, so if you find yourself having trouble communicating with one of the Japanese staff, just ask for a native speaker and you should be ok.Room Rate: You will definitely find that the room rates at this hotel are much cheaper than what you will find at other major hotel lines in Tokyo – almost as much as half. I think they get by on this due to the hotel's location, reduction in some amenities, and perhaps lower staffing. They also provide almost no benefits to Marriott status members. I was provided points upon check-in and a welcome drink token. No breakfast whatsoever, lounge, etc. I was told this upon check-in, and told that a daily noodle breakfast would cost 1,300 JPY. Not being a noodle breakfast guy, I did not try the noodle bar breakfast during my stay.Negatives: Being a Marriot Platinum member and not gaining any tangible benefit during my stay was a negative for me at this property. If I am traveling on my own dime and understand what I am walking into, then maybe I stay here to save a few dollars. If your budget allows more for lodging, then you will want to consider other Marriott properties in Tokyo which provide Platinum benefits. I probably would only stay here again if not traveling on business. Also, during my stay, they apparently had a grand opening party. There was no notice provided to me (either upon check-in or via notification to my room). I came back one night and the lounge had turned into a club with loud music, a DJ, and wrist bands being put on at the door. I didn’t see any notification of what was happening, so I assumed it was a private party of some sort. I found out afterwards that it was a grand opening party, and was a bit confused why no notification had been provided. Another negative is the elevators on each floor. If you have a room anywhere near the elevator, you will hear the constant dinging for when the elevator comes to your floor. They should find a way to reduce the volume, or cancel the audible notification if at all possible. I was woken up a few times by this elevator noise in the mornings. Also, I think they could do more with their kitchen and food menu. I took a glance at it and nothing sounded remotely appetizing to me. At least, nothing that would dissuade me from walking across the street to grab something from the convenience store. The food items all seemed to be frozen items that they would simply heat up and serve (vice freshly preparing in a kitchen by a cook staff). The staff was also unable to provide an electric outlet adaptor upon request (Japanese plugs do not use a ground, and you have to have a two-prong adaptor to use three-prong plugs). I was told to visit an electronics store next to the station to buy my own. One last note is the check-out receipt. For some reason (first time I have seen it done this way at a hotel in Tokyo), they add a lump sum consumption tax and also lump sum accommodation tax on the last day of the stay (vice showing the amount for each day during the stay). This can make it confusing for business travelers trying to reconcile their charges with their accounting departments. Each day’s total charge should be clearly delineated with all charges and taxes.Overall, the property is a good value for what you pay, and is a good value for a Tokyo hotel. For those used to extra hotel amenities, or Marriot status members who are accustomed to the usual perks, this property will not completely satisfy you. I expect the property will improve once they work out a few kinks from their recent opening.","Tokyo, Japan","bluejax21</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",34,3.0

I used a bus from Haneda airport to the Kinshicho train station which took only 30 minutes.The walk from the train station to the hotel was no more than 10 minutes. Walking to the hotel, though, would pass you through a red light district type area.The touts never bothered me and still felt safe walking through the neighborhood at night.The check in area looked like a bar and there's no actual signage to tell you otherwise except for directions once you enter the building. Check in was a breeze and I was provided a welcome drink which was some sort of tart grapefruit type drink. I was also provided with a drink voucher as recognition of my frequency status. The room was pretty much your average Japanese business hotel type with no closet. The down side of the room was that you had to hang your clothes on the wall were there was a table and chair also hanging. Another down side was that there was no mini fridge to keep your drinks or snacks should you decide to bring back to the hotel room. The bathroom only had a stand up shower. I didn't have a chance to check out the eating options in the lobby. There were plenty of eating options within walking distance of the area. Went out during the day to due some sightseeing and was suprised to see the card to I had inserted into the slot to turn on the room power had been taken. Though it says to insert the hotel key card, I inserted a different card. Luckily, housekeeping was just next door and ask for the card. Sure enough, he had it in his pocket. That evening, as I was about to shower, I come to find out that my toothbrush and razor had been thrown away. Why would housekeeping throw this away?!?! Even if I used the provided amenities that was in the bathroom, you still don't throw things away unless I'm checking out that day!!! I'm returning in January to watch the Sumo tournament and I really wanted to stay at this hotel again since it's only 1 train stop away from the Kokugikan. Unfortunately, after this experience, I will not be staying here again. This is a brand new hotel but the idea that my things were thrown away was enough to make me not want to return.

The property just opened in early November, so some things should sort themselves out (grapefruit juice, cleaning crew...also not having insurance for the bike rentals that are sitting in the entrance way), so for me, it would be worth returning.

There is no yukatas or pajamas in the room. There are no slippers, no bathtub. There is also neither kettle pot nor cups. Of course, there is no tea bag, and refrigerator. No free breakfast, even though Marriott's Platinum Elite members. Anyway, amenities commonly available in the Japanese city hotel, are not seen in this hotel. It looks like an European cheaper hotel. I recommend another business hotel in Japan in case of the same accommodation fee. The driving sound of the Metropolitan expressway becomes a little noisy while sleeping. But bed mattress is so good.",Tokyo,"AbeKumao</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo</strong>",10,2.0

But when I was approaching the hotel, I certainly realized I am in the middle of a Red light district with ladies of the trade at doorsteps and pimps on the sidewalk approaching pedestrians. Walk faster and shake my head. When I arrived at the Hotel, the security asked me to check in at the “Bar”, yes at the hotel bar. That’s my first. The girl at the bar took my passport and seem to have trouble finding my reservation, I open my Marriott App and show her my two consecutive night’s reservation. She thanks me for been a Marriott member and offered me a drinks, I said to her that I just want to go to my room and get some sleep, She said I can have that drink anytime during my stay. I told her that I prefer a non smoking room, high floor. Again, after 5 minutes , she told me that the only “clean “ room they have is on the 3rd floor. I ok and maybe I have that drink right now after all and I request a Gin and Tonic, she said “no” the free drink is their house drink and something with grapefruit juice. I am taking medication and can’t have grapefruit juice so I guess no drinks for me tonight. Ask if Platinum members get free breakfast? Nope, Platinum member get no benefits except that free grapefruit drink which I can’t have. After another 5 minutes, Got my keys and head to my room, the room is small but decent and clean.The next morning left at 8:30 to go to my meetings, came back around 2:30 pm to get some rest, struggle with the elevator and my key card is not working, went back to the bar to get my key card fixed and went back to my room for afternoon nap. My room wasn’t cleaned yet, well thought the maid just haven’t get to it yet. No worry, take a nap first. Then I was waken up by a call from the bar at 4 o’clock telling me My checkout time was 3 o’clock and I need to check out. ?？I said to him that I am staying 2 nights and that I told the lady when I checked in and I gave her both of my reservation number too. He said sorry and hand up. I went to my dinner arrangement early since I am up already. I came back to my room exhausted at 9:30 and my room key wasn’t working again. Had to go back to the bar to get my key made again. Waited in line for 5 minutes and got it done. Got to my room and found out no one came clean my room. Call the phone no one answered. So went down to the Bar AGAIN to find out what was going on, the music was loud, there are 4-5 staffs at the bar but only the Taiwanese guy were checking people in, I was first in line but the line started to get longer but other staff just kept chatting with other clients at the bar, finally Christopher came and asked me what I needed. I told him no one came clean my room and I just wanted to know what happened. He said the maid might had missed my room but it happens. Well what Can I said? He offer to bring me some towels but at this point I just want to get some sleep and move to the Ginza Courtyard tomorrow. At least the staff there do smile and do clean my room and not trying to get me to the bar every time I walk into the hotel. Pretty weird to see your table and chair hanging on the wall with your clothes.","Calabasas, California","TJ1688</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calabasas, California</strong>",17,1.0

The front desk staff was particularly helpful with getting around and finding things to do, and they had fresh squeezed OJ. Also it's int he heart of a night life scene. This was a win.","Teaneck, New Jersey","Sam R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Teaneck, New Jersey</strong>",7,5.0

First impression: casual, welcoming and stylish. The staff is incredibly friendly, and clearly excited to be here with the grand opening. There is a lot of interesting stuff to look at and the place seems designed for Instagramming millennials. I have to keep reminding myself that MOXY is a Marriott brand, because it feels like a big departure from their usual hotels. Things I loved: room design, incredibly comfortable beds, best shower I've ever experienced (!!!). The staff speaks excellent English and are so friendly (can't say that enough). The gym has great equipment and is a step up from other hotels I've stayed in. The ""Pimp My Noodles"" station in the lobby is fun and delicious. Things I didn't love: neighborhood seems a bit seedy at night (but coming from San Francisco, this is a walk in the park). You definitely get a more real experience of Tokyo here, and you can't beat the location to the metro and JR line, super convenient, so I think that this ends up being a wash. The rooms don't have a closet and are a bit small. This isn't a huge deal for me, as I packed light, but something you may want to plan for. There are free lockers in the lobby to hold extra baggage.One last thing I'd call out is that despite the small room size, it feels well thought out and stylish with every amenity you can think of. To top it off, the lobby/bar is a great place to relax and hang out, playing good music, good views of the hood, and a bar, so there is a community feel here that I've not seen at a hotel before. I loved it!Definitely consider staying here if your travels take you through Tokyo. ",,Chris P,16,5.0
