The hotel itself is dated from the reception area to the rooms, although it’s clean comfortable and user friendly. We were upset and surprised they cancelled access to our sons’ room after 2 nights as there was no credit card on the room- we had presumed both rooms were on our room credit card and this had worked fine for the first 2 nights. This caused confusion and delay in getting to bed fairly late one evening and was unnecessary and draconian. This was probably because our agent, Virgin holidays didn’t get our booking right, but that’s another story. I’m also still unsure why there is a daily credit card charge of 25 dollars for incidentals from the mini bar and room service, but we don’t really use either.The Irvington restaurant and bar are good, trendy and efficient and I’d recommend both. I just wish the rooms in the hotel had the same look and feel as they really are in need of a complete upgrade and make over. There is no Nespresso/ coffee machine in the room, but there is coffee offered at reception instead. Not ideal if you want an early morning cuppa in your PJ’s! We had to move room after the first night as we only had one of the two suites we’d booked and we were left to move all our luggage despite the hotel saying they would do this. The door staff are also a bit hit and miss - sometimes the heavy entrance door is held open for you and sometimes they leave you to struggle through - neither are big issues but it does leave the impression that this isn’t really a 5 star hotel. Would we come back? If the rates were much lower possibly and maybe if we booked direct, as the location is good and the beds comfy, however we paid top dollar for a five star hotel and holiday experience as recommended by Virgin holidays. They do need to revisit some of their recommendations and overall customer service. I suspect there are better options if you do your research. We would never use Virgin holidays again for a number of reasons, but that’s not the hotels fault. All in all it’s not a bad hotel at all - just not typical of the W brand and what you expect from it, so just be aware of that before you stay.

Our company is a preferred vendor. My wife and I could not be nicer more friendly people. We asked for a quiet room away from the elevators, and a view if possible but optional. When we arrived the front desk staff could not have been more indifferent. There was no line, no rush, but they rushed us through check-in like they had somewhere else to be. We were told there were no available upgrades. We asked about the quiet room away from the elevators and a view if possible. The response was more or less you get the room we give you and you don't have a choice. We were told it was a quiet room with a partial view. In fact the room shared a wall with the stairwell and all the elevators shafts. The elevator produced such a high pitched loud metal squeaking that it would wake the dead. Try taking a nap during the day but that was impossible with all the elevator traffic. At night traffic calmed down just enough for you to fall asleep before someone would use the elevator and the high pitch squeal would inevitably wake you up repeatedly all night long. The partial view was nothing but the brick wall of the adjacent building, no view period. After our check-in experience we didn't bother to complain to the front desk about the noise.The whole experience was a real shame because the room was a good size for New York. Bed was comfortable, heat worked well, plenty of space to unpack your suitcase and store clothing and bags in the wardrobe. Good counter space and water pressure in the bathroom. Decent size TV and the internet worked well. We had our doubts about how the $25 Daily Destination fee/credit would work but actually it worked out fine. We did use the in-room dining and the mini-bar and it was all accounted for accurately and they didn't try to screw us at check-out. The doormen were excellent help offering free umbrellas when it rained which we returned at the end of the day. We didn't use the lounge or restaurant because they were both very crowded and expensive with mediocre reviews online. Union Square is a great neighborhood. In the end I wish they would have listened to use and gave us a quiet room. Especially given our preferred vendor booking. That's all it would have taken for a positive stay.","Los Angeles, California","AmericanAbroad17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",32,2.0

The management absolutely needs to put this team on a training and maybe send them abroad to see how it's done in other countries and to learn what it means to serve in hospitality industry.A few examples:- checking in: after 24hours on the road (incl the world's longest flight from Singapore to Newark), I checked in via the app and said I would arrive at 9. I arrived several hours before that but decided to go for a walk and watch NYC awake. Upon coming back at 9, there was no room available for me and I got to hear that I would need to wait until noon, which is normal check-in time. So much for the Your24 benefit that Starwood used to offer... I finally got a room at 1pm... When I asked if I could get my luggage to use the gym facilities to freshen up, the staff returned my bags and let me haul them to the gym only to find out there is no dressing room or shower in the gym... At no point was the staff helpful or understanding for my situation, nor did they offer alternatives. However, as I found out later, as a Platinum Ambassador guest, I have access to the nearby Swerve gym where I could have showered and freshened up, hours before checking in.- Upgrades: I didnt get a room upgrade although I booked weeks in advance and I am a platinum member for almost 8 years now.- Check-in: you know how the front-end staff explains you your status benefits when you check-in? not so in the W Union Square. I found out later and just by stumbling upon a tiny card in my key holder that a) I had access to a great gym outside the hotel; b) a $25 voucher for in-room dining and c) a laundry voucher which I could not use because I found out too late (you need to turn in laundry before 9am or otherwise wait until 6pm the next day to get it back).","Singapore, Singapore","Dave_Singapore_1111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",1,2.0

Someone important was at the hotel too. Place was swamped with secret service type people. Lots of security inconvenience, but that’s not the hotel’s fault. It is what it is.I will add my voice to the complaints on the DESTINATION FEE. Awful!!!!! The hotel said it is to cover amenities “curated for guests’ enjoyment”. Amenities that are worthless. Access to a gym that is a few blocks away. Who needs a gym, you can get your exercise by walking all over NYC. Food credit that only works for room service and minibar; not the restaurant because the hotel doesn’t own the restaurant. But, you can charge your meal in the restaurant to your room. Huh? By the time you add the service charge, delivery charge etc for room service .... nothing cost $25 or less so you end up SPENDING money to take advantage of the food credit. Same thing with laundry service. As a LIFETIME GOLD ELITE member, I already get free wifi. In this day and age, WiFi should be included regardless. If the hotel is going to charge for WiFi, then it should be a SECURED WiFi. On top of that, the fee is taxed! So the $25 fee is actually $28+. The hotel industry argues that resort fees, destination fees etc offset revenues lost when guest book through third party booking services. May I suggest waiving the fee for Bonvoy members (especially elite status members) who book directly? These fees are dodgy money grabs. ",,Lucymilby,30,3.0

Firstly, the W has an unusually cramped lobby area with a lot of guests and employees loitering and a bottleneck at the door; it was a struggle to get the stroller in and out of the building. The room was also challenging - the high ceilings provided spectacular city views but also caused inefficient cooling and heating.

Details:They ripped me off on a dry cleaning charge. I had sent a dress to dry clean. The laundry form said a dress was $24 to clean. Imagine my surprise when I saw a $40 charge at checkout. When I challenged the increase and asked them why someone didn’t give me an option to decline the service they wouldn’t take responsibility for it stating “well we send it out and don’t do the laundry here.” Then he claimed that the dress was a party dress and required a hand wash. The “manager” offered me a 20% discount. I told him it was dishonest to overcharge me but he really didn’t care. I paid over $500 a night for this hotel and they didn’t want to do what’s right to fix this matter for a mere $8 difference.

On my first morning when I went to the restaurant for breakfast I was told that my breakfast had to be charged separately and I could only get free breakfast if ordered in case of room service. No-one cared to tell me this at check-in and it was too late for me to go back into the room and order breakfast there.- On my second morning I obviously ordered breakfast in the room: 1 eggs benedict, 1 coffee, 1 orange juice and 1 toast basket. At check out there was a $75 (!!!) charge to my bill. After complaining, I am told that Platinum guests are only allowed to have free Continental breakfast, which I was never told at check-in or the first day after I complained. They eventually removed the cost of the Continental breakfast but they still charged me for the difference between $75 and the Continental breakfast.- The destination fee was not deducted from my room service bill until the moment I highlighted that it should be deducted.- There were SOMEBODY ELSE’S CLOTHED in several drawers of my room!! This is a sign that the room was not properly cleaned, and no-one cared to remove them after me highlighting this to the front desk.Overall, I felt a complete lack of personalised service, and it felt like the whole business model is aimed at extracting as much cash from you as they can. As an example: they charge you $9 to sell you a travel adapter when in other W Hotels around the world you can actually just borrow one from the front desk. Also, they charge you $9 (!!!) for the bottle of water in the room. Come on, in which world does a bottle of water have the same value as a travel adapter??Really substandard service compared to the W Hotels I typically go to all around Europe (eg, London, Barcelona, etc.).If you are looking for a fun experience, instead of staying at this hotel you are much better off staying at the Standard High Line.",,Simone S,1,2.0

Hotel sits on northeast corner of Union Square and is easily accessible. Check in was easy; staff were pleasant. I had booked a ""Wonderful King,"" and was given a ""Spectacular King,"" which is something of an upgrade apparently. The room was just OK; perfectly acceptable, but nothing to write home about (well, except on Tripadvisor!). Odd in-room item: Three different water bottles - one was free, and not replenished after first night; one was $8, and the third was $9 (slightly larger bottle). Common areas in hotel were as expected -- lobby bar with direct access to on-site restaurant; mezzanine level seemed to be where all the business or social meetings were to happen. Best thing: The weekend farmers market in Union Square, immediately across the street from the hotel.","Atlanta, Georgia","chriscaseyatl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta, Georgia</strong>",9,3.0

It is (mostly) clean, the staff were very friendly, and the location is ideal. However, as an SPG loyal customer, I have a certain set of expectations about each brand, which are expectations that I believe those who created the brand want to me have. Starwood has, in fact, been an industry leader in ""lifestyle brands."" We have stayed at many W properties before. In almost all ways, this property fails when it comes to living up to W brand standards and really is not worthy of the brand.When I think of a W hotel, I expect a property that is not as full service or as luxurious as a St. Regis, but I do think I will get something that is a step up in both service and also in look & feel from a Westin or Sheraton. Most importantly, I expect a W to be cool and beautiful and interesting. It needs to have a certain vibe in all experiences from checking in, to the room, the shower, public spaces, elevators, etc. I want to walk into the room and be inspired by the decor, and in NY, to feel like I am in a hip urban oasis. It should feel like a loft in SoHo. It should connect be to the elements of the W brand that are in the city outside the hotel. Instead here is what I found:-A room with spartan decor that feels outdated -Stained window coverings and cracked paint on the ceiling -A bathroom that feels like a cheap suburban hotel with a shower curtain (gross!) instead of a glass door and a hideous vanity that belongs in a Holiday Inn, with broken glass over the ugly light fixtures. - Only minimal amenities in the bathroom (no q-tips, cotton balls, shaving cream,slippers, etc..nothing that could help it feel little more high end) -The Platinum breakfast (free for SPG plat elite) was in-room dining only, which is annoying, and only includes coffee and pastries. This is another area where they could easily do more to make up for other areas. -Strange art in the elevator that looks like 90's suburban art. -There is minimal public space. For most W hotels, the ""Living Room"" is a kind of destination that helps set the tone, but this is lacking here. This property has the bones to be amazing. The views are gorgeous and, as I said, the staff were great and the location can't be beat. I am sure that, due to the location, it is a cash cow and that the owner has little incentive to invest until the conditions are such that people start to book away from the property. That being said: For those that expect a typical W experience, look elsewhere. Here you will get only a basic hotel, and you'd be better off saving your money and going Sheraton or Four Points, etc.",,mish300,17,2.0

Everything looks good. I guess looks were the priority. Service has been abysmal. The door man didn't open the door for me. He was on his phone. Actually, I opened the door for him. He remained on his phone as he followed me inside and bumped into me while I tried to open the door and pull my luggage through at the same time. He didn't tip.I checked in at 10pm. There were two people behind the desk and one other person was checking in. They were taking a pretty long time. One might think the second desk person would look up, say a word, make a gesture, something. Instead, they avoided eye contact and decided this would be a good time to wander around the lobby, pretending to be busy. Then they disappeared into the back.I had about ten minutes to study the odd door man from the lobby while I waited. I thought--for sure this guy is just a hotel guest who chose to dress in all black and stand at the door. No, he was the door man.OK, I checked in. Look at the room service menu. It says (literally) that you should order from ""Whatever/Whenever."" Above that, it says that all food stops at 6:30pm. Called to figure out what's up. It's a typo on all the pages. Apparently the ""whatever"" attitude extended to proofreading. The menu suggests you can order from the Irvington downstairs but that's barely true. You can't order off the Irvington menu.No means of coffee in the room. Called downstairs. Any caffeine? ""Uhh... we can check maybe if we have a machine somewhere."" Never mind.

What I liked the most about it was the location, with my office downtown I was barely 20 minutes away from Whitehall with the R,W and yet there were so many food and entertainment options to take in daily. The rooms were also quite large by New York standards, and I did get upgraded quite a few times. The building is also an iconic one by NYC standards and the emergency stairwells still have the look and feel of 1920's New York architecture.However the only major gripe I have about the hotel is the lack of room service (for those days where I just did not want to leave the room), lack of an Platinum lounge and that breakfast is very sparse unlike other SPG properties. Although it is served in the room, there isn't any variety in breakfast options (Bread basket + choice of juice and hot beverage), which becomes difficult especially if you are staying for long periods. I would suggest that management offer a credit towards usage of the Irvington restaurant in the hotel downstairs (which does serve breakfast), as well a certain number of drinks. This would ensure that Platinum members' needs, who stay longer for business reasons, are taken care of. Additionally this property doesn't seem to participate in SPG points promotions due to which I did not stay a few times.","Kochi (Cochin), India","jayanth13</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kochi (Cochin), India</strong>",35,4.0

It's surrounded by several wonderful neighborhoods that are full of excellent cafes, bars and shops. Like most W hotels I've stayed in the music in the bar and public areas is *loud* complete with an in house DJ on a Friday afternoon for the post work/weekend crowd. The drinks in the bar are delicious, and even though it's a hotel bar in Manhattan I found the prices reasonable.

This is not explained at check in. When querying this we were told it's standard hotel practice around the world. Having stayed in many hotels around the world it's the first time we've encountered this.The debit card is charged to your bank account immediately but getting a refund if you haven't raided the mini bar takes, we are told two to three days plus extra days if a weekend occurs. A problem if you're planning on using your debit card later and the extra 50% has taken your account into dangerously low territory.The rooms are very nice, not exceptional but nice. However no tea or coffee making facilities in the room and only a small free bottle of still mineral water. Plenty of hip smart water in bottles in the room at an additional cost. No free wi if in the room but you can pay extra to get it. Hence the near 50% additonal charge I guess.Chamber staff are charming and friendly.At breakfast tea ordered, no milk supplied. Not a big problem unless it takes the waiter an age to bring it and then slams it on the table because you've caused them a problem and you're not a cool enough dude. By this time the water for the tea has turned from hot (ish) to tepid so fresh hot water asked for. A fair degree of eye rolling and under the breath tutting is not designed to make for a happy customer.Overall not the greatest customer experience.Good location, and if you like loud music in the reception area and are a cool hipster this is the place for you, but we'll give a miss next time and go somewhere that believes the customer is important to the business and not a nuisance to be tolerated.","Totland, United Kingdom","johnb6020</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Totland, United Kingdom</strong>",16,3.0

The hotel gave no explanation and no ETA of when it would be resolved (it wasn't resolved, by the way, while we were there). In 2017 an internet connection is not an amenity it is truly a necessity. My mom and I had to struggle to find wifi and go completely out of our way to get our work done. Separately, on my last day, my room key stopped working after I went to the gym. This was annoying but this happens sometimes, I get it. After patiently waiting in a long check in line, I get a new key, go up to my room, and it still doesn't work.

We are SPG preferred and gold members. The first 2 times we stayed we were upgraded to the Spectacular room and this time, the ABSOLUTELY AMAZING front desk upgraded us to a cool corner suite. Check in was a breeze - the front desk staff is extremely friendly and accommodating - please know, if they CAN, they will. Especially if you are Starwood. We had booked 2 rooms because we were bringing another couple who's was celebrating a birthday. Not only did the front desk upgrade one of our rooms to the cool corner suite, they gave us another upgraded room directly next to the suite so we could all be together and free drink cards because of the birthday! The area around Union Square is great - we were in the mood for sushi and went to Haru (across the street) which never disappointments. Easy access to the subway and the overall Union Square area is really lovely - Lots of great bars and speakeasys and restaurants and vibe.. Highly recommended area of NY. OK, the corner suite was AMAZING. The pictures on the W website of the suite really are on point. As soon as you walk in there is a closet and a mini bar with lots of snacks and drinks (pay as you go) and a great room that easily was large enough to entertain all 4 of us. The bedroom was down a small hallway and open (no door) - The bed (as always) was super comfy and I had a great nights sleep. The bathroom was in the hallway area and was very large with a standard shower, bathtub and nice big vanity with a big mirror. The bedroom was large and we had a great view of Union Square - they had put (from what i gathered) a small stool to stand up on and see over the ledge (since the windows were fairly high) The staff was attentive to our every need in a very timely manner and overall we have 0 negative things to say about this hotel. Another bonus to this hotel is there is a 12pm checkout! We asked for a later one and they had no problem accommodating us -- as stated above, if they can, they will - the front desk staff is really amazing. We will stay there every time we plan on visiting Union Square. The overall atmosphere of the entire hotel is great. contemporary mixed with vintage - The Irvington bar/lounge connected to the hotel was GREAT. the bartenders there are TOP NOTCH and the atmosphere was wonderful. we stopped there before brunch on our way out and were NOT disappointed.

I am a 29-year-old business traveler, appreciate a good sleep and effortless experiences, and am normally quite easy to please.The W Union Square is located at the north-east corner of Union Sq and is thus in the coolest part of town if you're a tourist: both mid and downtown experiences are not far away, Soho etc. are just around the corner. For business travelers, the location depends on what you prefer: easy access to JFK/LGA/EWR vs. proximity to your office. My office is 5min walking, which is why I stay in the area. Transport to JFK is always 1-1.30h in the afternoon.As for the rooms: they are spacious for NYC, the bed is very comfy and the AC operates quietly. The bathroom is clean but seemed a bit aged both of the times. The only drawbacks that I've experienced are non-soundproofed windows (rare in NYC anyways), scarce amenity kit (no comb, file, shoe horn, ...). Compared to other W hotels I've been in, the rooms could definitely need an overhaul if they want to fit in the W design world.Service was great at the Front Desk, they got me nice quiet rooms (although no upgrade despite status, seemed pretty booked). Doormen are something you need to get used to. I had two big suitcases and would've loved if they opened the door for me when I was leaving. But then again, as soon as you ask they were very helpful.Overall a solid 4/5 rating, esp. when compared to the Standard East Village, which is my preferred hotel in the area.","Colombo, Sri Lanka","SvenssonDE</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Colombo, Sri Lanka</strong>",48,4.0

Can I blame the Marriott merger? I'm just asking because I used to think W hotels were basically perfect, but I'm starting to rethink my loyalty after this somewhat underwhelming visit (I'd say 3.5 stars), which came on the heels of a just-ok stay in another city.This is a great building, and our room was spacious and beautiful. Obviously the location is a huge part of why anyone stays here. The bathroom door was weird and didn't fully close, but that wasn't the big problem. The bed was perfect, that is one thing that never lets me down at a W.The biggest problem was that our room wasn't cleaned properly, and we are far from neat freaks. A dirty glass was put back on the sink on our second day there (I could see some of my lip gloss on it from the day before). At least it was my lipstick, though: On the afternoon of our second day we noticed a hair clip on the floor next to one side of the bed. This was kind of icky because unless it came from the room attendants themselves, it had been there since before we checked in. Making us think that not only had the room barely been cleaned when we were there, the room had barely been cleaned before we got there. The artsy molding/header above the bed was also coated in dust, and our bed wasn't fully finished being made up, either.Sure, we could have called the front desk and demanded a second cleaning, or asked to move or something.

And the view? Spectacular. Breathtaking. And mesmerizing. The room was very large and fit 3 adults beautifully. Everyone at the hotel is very friendly and made sure our stay was absolutely perfect. One of the doormen went above and beyond to talk to us about a certain college, and although we didn't get his name, we enjoyed talking to him (I think it was a Saturday morning conversation). I never mention the soap or other supplies because they're usually all about the same, and I usually bring my own because hotel soaps and shampoos aren't very good, but at the W, I really liked their products. They smelled terrific and the shampoo worked very well on even on my color treated hair. I also never mention the shower but it was freaking amazing. As someone who has lived in a drought for many, many years, it was incredible to be blasted with water. I'm sure my shower was shorter because it didn't take forever to rinse the soap out!The location can't be beat. We were anywhere we wanted to be in a few minutes time via a Lyft. And there was cheap shopping nearby. My daughter, a California native, didn't think to bring a coat, so we walked to Burlington Coat Factory and purchased a couple for her comfort.What can I say?

More importantly, is that how ANY guest should be treated at a SPG category 6 hotel? What if I had an emergency and need to rush back to my room?I guess in this scenario, there are certain ways which he could have approached it. I'm sure you would agree that his was not an option.

The hotel has a great boutique feel to it, seeing that this property was formerly the Guaranty Life building, dating back to the early 20th century. Much of the beaux-arts architectural features are still evident throughout the property, including the adornments surrounding the elevators.   The rooms themselves are quite nice, feeling particularly spacious due to their very high ceilings, with a modern flair and comfortable bedding. The headboard in each room is a stylized map of the Union Square area (and I hate to admit that I didn’t realize that until my fourth stay). Rooms on the upper floors facing south (on the 17th Street side) have a great view of Union Square, downtown Manhattan, and One World Trade. The bathrooms are stocked with Bliss products, and who doesn’t like to start off the day with some Soapy Suds?  Right off the lobby, there’s a nice on-property bar/restaurant named Irvington. You should definitely stop in for a drink while you’re at the hotel - perfect for a pre-theatre cocktail or a post-dinner night-cap. Try their barrel-aged Manhattan - it’s tops.  What makes this place special is its top-notch staff. Unlike many Manhattan properties, the personal touch is more than evident here, with the staff going above and beyond to make sure everything is just right. Before I arrived for my most recent stay, I got in touch with Natacia, the lovely Welcome Desk Talent Coach who I had met on a previous stay, to let her know that we’d be celebrating a close friend’s 50th birthday. Not only did she arrange for rooms with a great view of Union Square, but I’ve also nicknamed her the ‘birthday elf’ for being so nice as to have a bottle of prosecco delivered to the birthday boy’s room, where we enjoyed a celebratory glass (or three) before heading out for dinner.   There’s many more people I can say great things about, like Stella, who helped me with my reservation over the phone, to Tiffany, who made sure everything was just right at check-in, to the ever-so-riendly housekeeper assigned to my room over the weekend, with everyone doing their part to make sure that this was a picture-perfect stay. It’s people like these who keep me coming back to the W New York - Union Square, people who make us feel like welcome guests in their home, something I particularly appreciate when my travels bring me back to my hometown.

The only unpleasant detail of our trip was that the building across 17th Street from the hotel is being renovated, and the crew started in with jackhammers at 7:00 on Monday morning. Obviously, the hotel can't do anything about that. It's just life in New York.

That is not so at this particular W. it is a bit on the quieter side and we like it like that. We've had larger and smaller rooms. This visit we only asked for a standard room. The room (especially the bed) was very comfortable. Previously we had been able to open the windows at this location (which we enjoy) and when we went to open the window on this visit there was definitely something wrong with the window. We reported it to the front desk who explained that the windows should've been locked shut and a new safety precaution. Our room was handicap accessible so the bathroom was fairly large, but oddly enough when we went to hang up our clothes we only had a low hanging bar. We were in town for a black tie wedding so I had no where to hang my gown except on the automatic door closure behind the door.

It's kitty corner from Union Square and situated on the Park Ave S which is a beautiful boulevard with lots of restaurants and useful businesses like Chase, Bank of America, Starbucks, etc. It's also very close to some of the best restaurants I've eaten at, such as Gramercy Tavern. Craving some shopping at Nordstrom Rack, Best Buy, Whole Foods? No problem, just a 3-5 minute walk away.So you get the point, the fantastic is great. How about the hotel? Well, it's a W Hotel which is one of Starwood's hipper properties. The Living Room lounge downstairs is quite nice (but oddly arranged): they play music in the evenings and you can grab a cocktail from the bar (part of the Irvington Restaurant) and some small bites. The rooms are really big for New York, but you can tell they're a bit dated. Unfortunately, the bathrooms are really old - you sometimes see signs of mold on the caulking in the shower, or that the caulking is coming apart - but at least it's functional.The two best things about the hotel are the beds and the bathroom amenities. The beds are super comfortable and the quality of the bedding material (sheets, blankets, pillows) is also very high. The amenities are the famous Bliss line of products which are fantastic.The complimentary internet is so-so at best, especially when the majority of rooms are occupied. It's enough for sending emails and casual browsing on the web, but don't expect to stream a lot of HD movies. (Who doesn't offer free Wifi to their Elite members these days?)I mentioned average service in the title - and here's why: The front desk is manned by folks who seem to be quite apathetic. They're not interested in providing top notch service to you - they just want to get you in the door and out of their hair. They don't try to go above and beyond, which is what I expect if I'm a regular at the hotel AND an SPG Elite (not to mention nights at this hotel often cost over $500). There is one person who is relatively friendly, but I only run into them at check-out (due to the time of their shift). I shipped some stuff to the hotel recently and got charged a ridiculous package fee. At an average $500 a night, why do they need to charge me $8 for retrieving a box from Amazon?In summary, if you're looking for hotels with humane room size in the area, this is a great one. Just don't expect the service to be top notch.","Stockholm, Sweden","calkenneth</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Stockholm, Sweden</strong>",33,4.0

You are close to so many subway options and are just a few minutes from Washington Square Park or the Flatiron Building.

However, it was a Friday night and we did not encounter any more problems. As a matter-of-fact, we finished each day of sightseeing with a drink in the bar and never had trouble finding someplace to sit. The food and drinks were very good. The corner room is very spacious. However, the bathroom is one of the smallest I have ever encountered. Explain that one to me. When I say small, I mean so small that two people cannot be in there simultaneously, especially with the door open. It barely closes without hitting the toilet and vanity. Other than the bathroom, the room and hotel were great. The bed was very comfortable and it was nice having a small couch that made the room larger than a typical New York room.

I'll start with the negative points so I can end on a positive.1. Expensive $$$$ - While we were lucky enough to have had our hotel paid for as a gift there is no way I would stay here on my own dime especially with the negatives.2. When you check in, the music in the lobby is so loud you can hardly hear the person at the registration desk. Never before have I experienced such loud music in a lobby??3. We went to the bar for a drink and while the music was loud in the lobby it was much louder in the lounge ... does nobody talk anymore?? We sure couldn't!!4. Lounge service was slow. We went there on a Friday night and there was one bartender working for an entire bar full of patrons ... we almost walked out when finally (after a 15 minute wait) we got served.5. Rooms are small as are the bathrooms. You can't have the closet door open and expect to walk by. Probably typical for Manhattan but again ... the price ????6. Everything comes at an extra charge even a bottle of water. We thought of having room service but there was a $10 delivery charge ... what??? isn't the high price of the food enough?We did however liked a number of things as follows:1. Location is fantastic ... my wife and I like to walk and you can walk almost anywhere in downtown New York from here.2. Room cleaning crew were invisible and very good, rooms were very clean as was the entire hotel.3. The ""Living Room"" is a nice place to sit, enjoy a coffee and people watch.4. All staff were friendly and helpful.All in all not worth the money ... some of the other things like the loud music etc could be a factor of age.

I recently stayed at the JW Marriott Essex house for a business trip and 2 weeks later returned to the city and stayed here at this hotel for another business trip. You can read my review of the Essex house but my stay was disappointing. From the moment I checked in here at the W however the level of service greatly exceeded that of my experience at the Essex House. Upon check in I was upgraded to a corner room (at least I believe it was an upgrade, the hotel was booked through our meeting planner) and asked if I needed a 4pm late checkout which I did indeed. It's so nice automatically being offered the late check out versus having to beg for one. The room itself was very very nice. Great comfy bed, nice view, wonderful toiletries in the bathroom (I love the Bliss products) and overall, a very comfortable room. The housekeeper was outside and I needed some extra face wash and she was extremely friendly and accommodating.The front desk people were great with restaurant recommendations and directions. We had a meeting at the hotel and the food for breakfast and lunch that was served was very good. I would come back here again and had I not already booked the Westin Grand Central for my upcoming trip in a few days I would have returned here.

I eventually had to get a key. (The door to the room consistently unlocked on the first try with my iPhone or Watch, so it must be a problem with the elevators.)I had a tough time with the room thermostat - it was a cold week when I visited but I had to set the temp to 76 before I felt like the room was bearable. The shower was small & dark, the towels had seen quite a bit of wear, and the sheets felt scratchy. It just didn't compare to stays at other Ws.All that said, I do love the Bliss bath products, the wifi is decent, and the staff is super-helpful. For a business trip, this was more than adequate.

Hotel is super convenient to many of the best parts of Manhattan by subway, walking or car. Our room was pretty big by Manhattan standards and it also had nice, high ceilings. Room was very clean. We had a daybed where a friend crashed one night (we stayed over NYE) and we asked the front desk that a duvet be brought up. They sent someone up from housekeeping to fully make it up like a proper bed, which was much appreciated. I was sick during most of my stay and got food delivery from several apps. Staff offered to bring it up to the room instead of going to the lobby to meet the delivery person (elevator only works with room keycard). Bed was very comfortable with soft sheets, minibar fridge had a little extra room for my own treats. Only downsides: Front desk was very understaffed (one person) both when I was checking in and out. Also, I'm a Platinum SPG member and nothing in the way of a larger room of upgrade was offered or even mentioned during check-in. Just got the room we booked. It might have been related to our first night there being NYE, but it would've been appreciated if something along the lines of ""we're fully booked and I'm afraid we have no available upgraded rooms..."" was mentioned. Especially since on my previous stay in the Sheraton the same thing happened, but it definitely wasn't a peak time. Overall, recommended. Our room was under $300 a night and a little above the basic category, which for a good Manhattan hotel in this area is an excellent deal, even for January.

They were thoughtful, attentive and made sure we knew where all the best spots were in NY. I researched alot of different places, but Tanja and Bernardo had the inside scoop on where to hang out, which scene would fit our mood, and the best time/day to go to certain places. We even received a bottle of champagne in our room upon arrival to kick off our birthday celebration. During our conversation, I mentioned I liked Moscow Mule cocktails. The next day, Tanja/Bernardo left a very cute, Moscow Mule cocktail kit in our room. I was shocked and surprised and moved by their thoughtfulness. Stella checked us out and she was also a delight. Beautiful personality! We spent two nights at the W and spent our last night at Le Parker Meridien. We left the W thinking we would have the same (or better) experience at the Meridien. NOT! The Meridien is a very nice hotel (also a starwood hotel), but if you want to be pampered and treated like a queen or king...stay at the W. When we turned in for the night, I remember saying - ""I miss my family at the W"". And that was the honest to God truth. The W in Union Square is now my home away from home. Tanja, Bernardo, Stella - thank you for everything. You truly made our birthday celebration unforgettable.","Chicago, Illinois","Tamara M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",1,5.0

The disappointment began when the doorman didn't hold either of the double doors for me when I arrived. He just watched me struggle with a large suitcase and a heavy carry-on and a handbag and told me there was a ramp to my left. When I checked in they told me I was getting a complimentary upgrade to a park view. When I got up to my room there was no view of a park it was of other buildings and the pebbles on the lower roof. Which, I would have been fine with had they not reset my expectations that I was getting a park view. The room itself was worn looking. The carpet was fraying between the bedroom and bathroom. The towels were small and rough like what I get in the gym. The bed was comfortable, but no blackout curtains so I couldn't sleep in. Also, there was some thing (maybe the phone?) that had flashing blue lights on one of the bedside tables. I just had to pull the plug out of the wall to stop it from flashing after I went to bed. The shower had almost no water pressure and was cold. I had goosebumps while I was in the shower! When I checked out, they didn't ask how my stay was and I volunteered that they look into the shower situation. There was no apologies for my cold shower or discount or any goodwill gesture of any kind. When I went outside to catch a cab, once again zero help with doors or bags.

I will say though Front Desk check in service was great.Had a room on 4th Floor, Park avenue. So loud. Woke up every night 3 or 4 times. Not the Hotel's fault just a warning.Back to the Doorman or lack thereof...I don't need/want a Doorman to open the door when I am only carrying my purse. I do want a doorman when I am carrying bags and boxes to my son's Dorm and hailing a cab. We had to struggle with doors on our own when moving suitcases, bags, boxes at 9:00am. Hailed our own cab at 7:00 pm on Friday to go to the theatre because no bellman/doorman in sight. Unacceptable for an NYC hotel. I have never had to hail my own cab at a hotel anywhere in the world.

One other minor issue is that the elevators are a bit slow and small, but this is a pretty common issue in the city.

Great staff: check-in was very smooth and my SPG room preferences were noted. While we were not offered a late checkout upon check-in, we checked out at 1 pm without any fuss. The room staff were quick and efficient. Bellboy was great. Prime location: lots to do around here. You can easily walk everywhere interesting in lower Manhattan. Grand Central's near, too.Fair value: Our stay was neither cheap nor outrageously expensive. We paid $286 per night, inclusive of tax and all the bizarre tolls that rent-seeking politicians of New York have created for you (Javits Fee? http://goo.gl/2MD5rP). In Manhattan, you will be hard-pressed to find a good room under $200, thanks to the city's bullying of AirBnB. So if you're paying $200, why not pay $300? You're already splitting the room with a friend or girlfriend, so the surcharge is halved, and . At least that was our logic. Feels cramped: it lacks some of the spaciousness that other SPG hotels are known for. Don't expect any big, open areas, wide hallways, or enormous rooms. This is lower Manhattan. You will not have much room to move indoors, and you'll want to be people watching, anyway.I know, that sounds like an argument to get a room at Holiday Inn Express or Four Points Sheraton, instead. We didn't, because we wanted Union Square's access to the entire city by MTA and Uber. Final notes: The good:- Irvington is good. Great for breakfast. Great cocktails too.The bad:- There is no fitness center.

The lobby and staff are very friendly and helpful to recommend great bars/restaurants in the surrounding area. They also hooked me up with an umbrella one morning while a torrential rain storm visited my commute, thanks W Hotel, you were a life saver! The room was very spacious, modern, clean and very well kept. Internet access was easy and worked great the whole week. Second, the location...the hotel is very close (short walk south) to the 14th St. subway which houses access to the 4,5,6 (east side) trains, in addition to the N, Q, R trains. Also, if you have time, Union Square Park offers a nice little urban oasis to take a quick lunch or coffee break during the day. Just south of Union Square is the NYU/Village area, which is roughly a 15-20 minute walk through great neighborhoods filled with bars and restaurants. I would definitely recommend the W Union Square park for an experience in a true NYC neighborhood, away from the standard issue hotels of midtown/times sq.","Chicago, Illinois","Matt M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",14,5.0

I was able to use an upgrade so was lucky enough to stay in one of the suites with a glorious view from the 21st floor. I found the staff to be somewhat inconsistent, with some extremely accommodating and gracious, while others seemed a bit detached, distracted, though not rude. The Concierge WAS particularly friendly and knowledgeable. Many at the front desk seemed somehow a bit preoccupied; perhaps they were simply busy. I was surprised that the hotel did not always provide a doorman to open/close the door. Not a terribly big deal though I have come to expect this while staying at large, urban upscale properties around the world. Maybe it’s just New York….In case case, the hotel lacks a Club Lounge for Starwood members which was a disappointment, but oh well. The rooms, while a bit austere were very comfortable and well enough appointed and daily housekeeping was excellent. Also, with only two elevators, the wait time for the elevators can be a bit long.I LOVE the fact that this hotel featured the new Keyless Access via the iPhone Starwood app; the future here now! :) I DID have a problem with it as I had two consecutive reservations and their system still has a few software bugs to work out. Also, for frequent travelers with iPhone or Watch know that if you initially signed up for keyless entry with a different device you must unregister the device and re-register. I experienced an issue as I had initially registered with an iPhone that was recently replaced due to a hardware issue. But once we got that sorted out with a tech savvy manager’s help, it was awesome and worked flawlessly. Love it. Bottom line , I can recommend this property.

The restaurant, which is in the lobby, is owned by another entity. That could or could not be a bad thing, but the reason it rubs me the wrong way is after paying close to $20 a day for wi-fi in the hotel you can not access it in the restaurant. I find that annoying and takes an otherwise solid hotel and puts it in another category.

I keep coming back to it because of its fantastic location. Most of my recent stays have been for pleasure for 1-2 nights at a time. This past weekend we stayed for 2 nights and had a great room (corner room with great views). What makes this hotel so good is its ideal location. You are in the heart of Union Square and on the edge of the Flatiron district but also a short walk downtown to Soho. Room sizes are a decent size for NYC and the extra high ceilings make the rooms feel even larger. Bathrooms are ok, not great and starting to look like they could use a refresh. The hotel has a nice vibe to it and a great restaurant/bar on the first floor to grab a drink before heading out for the evening or a night cap after dinner. The past few times I've stayed here the service was inconsistent. On our most recent stay this past weekend we felt as if some of the staff wasn't on par. Example, on our way back from dinner Saturday night as we came through the door the doorman was sitting and texting on his phone as we went by him back into the hotel. When we checked out we carried our luggage downstairs. As we approached the front door the doorman starred at us and didn't offer to help us with our bags. I had to put my bags down, approach him and ask for help before he actually took our bags.

Ummm it would've been nice if someone had told us before hand. So we had to take a lesser room, just to avoid waiting an additional hour. Not to mention, when we first arrived our bags remained unattended in the middle of the lobby even though it was known that we didn't have a room yet. We had to take a lesser room, on a different floor in order to avoid having to wait an additional hour for the room we originally booked.

Despite that, I've remained curious about the W Union Sq over the years. So I decided to stay here from May 27-30 in a Wonderful Room in room 1603, and I'm glad I did.Unlike my last 2 W stays, the bellhops were generally attentive. However, Jose was incredibly helpful and personable in assisting me with check-in, discussing the hotel's features and bringing my luggage to my room. And while W's are known for being trendy with slightly cool personnel, Jose gave a nice welcome to the hotel and a warm hello or nod in passing in the lobby for the remainder of my stay. So, if you're planning to stay at the W Union Square, find Jose; he'll be very helpful.In my experience with this and every other W I've stayed, the front desk just isn't efficient. There was 1 person at 3pm and I have yet to visit a W where there is an active separate SPG check-in/-out line. So, I think there was 1 person in front of me, and check-in took between 10-15 mins. **On the upside, and in all fairness re: recognition of SPG benefits, my requests for a high floor and corner or near corner room away from the lifts were both honored. Room 1603, a Wonderful Room, was exactly that: wonderful. I didn't need a large room or suite for this trip. The decor was exactly what you'd expect of a W, and I def enjoyed the choice in decor at the W Union Sq and my room. It is evident that form and function were taken into appropriate consideration to accommodate travelers and their needs across the spectrum. There was a fair amount of storage space for bags. It was on a high enough floor that street noise wasn't a problem with a great view of the Empire State Bldg. As for the location of this W, and for someone who used to live in Manhattan, I think the W Union Square has the best location of any W in NYC (unless, of course, you're in NYC on business and work on Wall St., then the W Downtown). Union Square quite literally brings all of NYC to the hotel's doorstep. Anything that you would need/want is in the vicinity of Union Sq. If you need to go farther, Union Sq/14th St. is a major junction for subways, providing convenience with little to no need for subway transfers. Also, this W is in a relatively quiet area as far as street noise is concerned -- compared to the majority of hotels you'll find in NYC.Some criticism...At the time (late May), the lifts were being worked on. I don't recall seeing signage advising guests when the lobby lifts were working or not. And, while I understand maintenance needs to be addressed, the passage way and vestibule-like area in back and to the right of the reg lobby lifts felt like I had left the W and its swanky decor and walking into a janitors closet. The area should have keep consistent with the hotel's decor. The lift bays/area on the 16th floor were also shabby for a SPG Cat. 6.I enjoyed my time at the W Union Square and would visit again.","Sydney, Australia","Trekkingtheglobe_10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",135,4.0

I am a very loyal SPG Corporate member so I have stayed in a vast amount of hotels in my life. Yet I had never stayed at a W Hotel. It all began upon checking and finding out that my 11th floor room had no elevator service and was forced to go through a maze to use service elevators which the hotel did not tell me about as they were taking my money. Secondly, after arriving into my decent room it was rather warm. So I waited a few hours and the temp was going up not down. Around 4pm I told the front desk of the issue and they offered to switch me room. I agreed but I would have to do so after I got back from my meeting. Upon my arrival back at the hotel I told the front desk person (MARIA) who was the rudest person I have ever met in my life. She asked ""Are you really going to switch rooms now?"" I said of course I have a 4pm check out and it extremely hot in that room. Finally I had to get the manager who was completely clueless to the situation then switched me room to another floor. I packed my things and with no help and 6 suitcases I had to maneuver through a maze to get to the service elevator again with no offering help from the hotel or even a luggage cart. Upon getting in the new room I realized that they had downgraded my room. Call me crazy but when there is a problem that is the hotels fault you would think they would atlas give you the same or better than you had. Instead I got a room that was half the size and when I told the manager he argued that it was the same. Call me crazy but when you got from a large shower and separate bathtub to a standup shower right beside the toilet and sink is not the same size.

But 22 minutes. And $20! What else are they doing at 0545 - because ... Exhibit #2: ... breakfast only starts at 0700. Come on, in New York?! Really?Exhibit #3: front desk answers the phone by yelling ""Front Desk"" at me, like they imagine this is the way people do things in New York. Again, a 'come on' moment. What about 'Good Morning' first. Exhibit #4: parts of the room were just not cleaned. Hairs and fingerprints on shiny surfaces, and areas behind the desk, just not hoovered. OK, these are first world problems, you say, and normally I'd overlook these things. But the reason I mention them is that if you're paying a bit over $500 for a room as I did, I really think you have the right to expect something pretty seriously special. Even in New York.

By the time I am booked into a room right in front of the elevators it has been about half an hr since my arrival. I thought my troubles would end there but, alas, it was not meant to be. The next day, I spent approximately 12 minutes waiting for the elevator before I had to give up and call the front desk. The elevators had been functioning very slowly since my arrival but this was just ridiculous. He told me one elevator was out of service and another was busy (not sure what that means). He promised to send up an elevator with an attendee. I waited a few more minutes before giving up and taking the stairs. One cancelled uber charge later...The rooms are also nowhere near as modern looking as I have come to expect from a W. My bathroom looked quite dated. Overall, I am very unimpressed.

The lobby bar/restaurant was being renovated during our stay, but there was still some 'living room' space and they had complimentary breakfast items in the AM which made up for the construction space.Compared to other Ws this one was up to par in terms of overall cleanliness and character, but the room was a little blah. Nice bed and a few modern touches as usual, and great bliss products, but the room seemed a little old and plain. Bathroom was definitely older and not as fresh/modern as you'd expect in a W.If you're a fan of Ws, choose this one for the area.

The Saturday Farmer's Market is great and I'm always game for browsing at the giant Barnes and Noble right across the street (although Strand, a few blocks down is my favorite) as it the Red Door spa. The Union Square Theater is right next door and there are shops and restaurants in every direction (I still get a kick out of visiting the always pretty/irritated hostess at Coffee Shop across the street at breakfast). It's an enjoyable walk to both the East and West Village, with plenty of cute little shops and coffee houses, and since Union Square is not the night life central, I slept well at this hotel.

I had several interactions with the front desk with multiple people which left me slightly disappointed. Examples: I needed some assistance with printing my airline boarding pass and the woman at the front desk didn't even listen to me or let me finish my sentence before referring me to their self service kiosk. (Not what I needed.) Next, my colleague asked concierge if he could store his luggage after checking out. He was told no and he had to go to the front desk. Finally, I was in the process of checking out and I asked if I could add a room gratuity to my bill. (I didn't have any cash to leave the room attendant.) I was told the W does not offer cash advances (not what I asked) and when I clarified my request, I was told, ""No, the hotel doesn't do that. (Fine, I accept that.) I found some cash and asked if I could just run up to the room and I was told, ""No - you already checked out."" I asked for an escort so I could leave the cash in the room and I was told that they would have to call someone from housekeeping and it might take a moment. Arrgh! Was the service horrendous - absolutely not. But in my one night stay, I had a lot of ""no""s thrown at me.

His collar was unbuttoned and tie was undone, which gave him a very unprofessional appearance. Additionally, he had an American flag lapel pin, and the flag was upside down. This is extremely disrespectful and a true disgrace to our country and especially those who fought and lost their lives for his freedom. Needless to say, corporate needs to tighten up their front desk. The original room that I was assigned was facing a bank of HVAC units that was producing an incredible amount of noise, and the old windows could not block it, so I asked to be moved. I was moved, but to another room facing yet another set of HVAC units. I gave up! The room in which I stayed in was dirty! The window frame was extremely dirty with heavy black dirt. Furthermore, there were some artifacts left behind by the previous guest, which is a clear indicator that the room was not properly cleaned nor was it inspected by the housekeeping supervisor. Additionally, the bathroom was very dirty, especially around the shower area and floor.The amenities in the bathroom was nice and there were ample towels, which was needed to layer the dirty floor after I stepped out of the shower. I left the hotel at 0645 and there wasn't a bill under my door, so I stopped by the front desk to check out and grab a cup of coffee since there isn't a coffee maker in the rooms. To my surprise, there wasn't a staff member to be found! That means I was unable to get a copy of my bill for my expense report, and now I will have to fight to get a copy of my bill.There are so many other nicer hotels to stay in New York.

They switched out the pillows and removed the foreign hairs, but didn't look like they did anything else to clean the bathrooms. Overall, the rooms just felt dirty, and for $400/night, it shouldn't feel that way. My interactions with the front desk was good, but my mother said they were rude to her when she was also working through some issues with them.The front door men were good at opening the door for you about half of the time and the other half of the time they were too engaged their own conversations to notice you were coming in.

For years, this was our go-to hotel until a noticeable drop in service in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy (my understanding is that this particular hotel was the temporary home to many emergency workers and displaced residents). Both the facilities and staff had become noticeably ""tired,"" though we never voiced our complaints to the staff as the hotel had been so good to us in the past. Instead, on future trips to NYC we chose alternate SPG hotels (we are Platinum), however, sorely missed our preferred Union Square location and decided to give the hotel another try on this stay. So very glad we did! Although Joel (the new GM) had no prior knowledge of our concerns during previous stays, he succeeded to make this visit the most exemplary yet, and the best part of the experience was that the stellar service began within the first sixty seconds of our arrival and continued on through to checkout. ""Above and beyond"" doesn't even begin to cover the 5 star service we received, and on a sold-out evening no less! The view from our upgraded room was so jaw dropping we elected to cut our evening short and ""slept in"" as to spend more time in the room, which is a first for us.A big kudos to you and all of your staff for a job well done. A special shout out to Marcos at the bar, who may quite possibly be the best bartender ever!One complaint -- Although the few bars items we sampled from the kitchen were satisfying, we are missing Olives!

The bed and pillows were not all that comfortable and the shower pressure was just okay.

I am a 40 year old female, traveling solo, and wanted a comfy bed, a clean room, a subway-accessible location, a diverse guest clientele (for people-watching and for blending into), a place to lounge, and a friendly staff. The W Union Square provided all of this. Plus I really enjoyed the Union Square location-- strolled out on a Friday morning and was happy to see a Farmer's Market where I bought fresh fruit and bread. I didn't even end up using the subway system... I was able to walk to the Empire State Building, and to shopping, and to the comedy club, ""The Stand."" And for the rest, cabbing was easy, because the staff was always ready to hail a cab for me. The room was spacious and the bed and pillows were super-comfortable. The lounge area is cool, and the bar/restaurant was always ready to serve. Plus the hot apple cider and green apples at the front desk was a bonus.But mostly, what made the experience nice was the staff who worked there. The staff was excellent from check-in to check-out. The doormen, the concierges (George and Joseph), the front desk staff, and the Welcome Desk Talent Coach (Joel Davis), were all wonderfully professional, friendly, and helpful. They were always ready to provide tips or help, and make sure everything was going great. By the end, I felt like I had a few people to count on, and didn't even feel alone!p.s.

Lots of eateries around, no complains about that.However, service wasn't fantastic (except for some very friendly doormen) and it showed the first day we arrive... there were in-room dining trays lining the corridor to our room for the entire day and we were starting to worry about it starting to smell. On some days, housekeeping takes ages (more than half an hour and after 3 phone calls to Whatever/Whenever) to attend to your needs. We were also locked out of our room on our last day because for some reason the system failed to recognise that we have earlier requested for late check-out. Thereafter we were continually harassed by 3 different housekeepers attempting to clean our room because they were not aware that we were checking out late either. Overall, we feel that service needs to be improved and the hotel probably needs a facelift perhaps in keeping in line with the W theme and what W has grown to be famous for - hip and trendy vibe.

One woman worked hard to upgrade us the second night of our stay.

In addition, sometimes guests end up packed in the elevator just because of the frustration caused by the wait. Staff is coping when they can by taking guests to the service elevator, but it's never clear when they'll help you and when they won't. The hotel is otherwise adequate, though nothing stands out.

You could do a lot worse in NYC than this, and probably not much better for the price, which like most decent or better hotels in NYC is fairly expensive.

I was informed my room was ""quiet"" but then it appeared my view was facing internally and I was looking directly into at another person's room. However, the rooms with the outward street views were reportedly very noisy as per my colleagues irregardless of what floor people were on. Overall, the rooms are reasonably sized and clean but very dark especially if facing within the hotel. The restaurant/lounge seemed to be nice, trendy, and busy. The lounge service was above average despite our large party. The drink list is very standard but good with classic and new cocktail options.

The dish was sent back to the kitchen immediately. But we did not receive any complementary appetizers or desserts much less an apology from the manager which should have occurred immediately. I would say if you are just staying overnight, just enjoy the city and maybe meet your friends at the lounge if they are also staying at the same hotel. But venture outside for a great walk in the city and eat somewhere new or make a reservation at the classic restaurants such as Gotham Grill, Union Square, Gramercy Tavern., etc. all are within walking distance and have been churning out great food for decades and are still reliable and will make the dark and noisy hotel night stay worthwhile.","Houston, Texas","docfoodie2013</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",70,3.0

The room was lovely and clean courtesy of a well run housekeeping staff, and by any standard a big room (for NYC a huge room and quiet) with all the amenities. The W Union Square is the perfect combination of a boutique hotel and a large property-the warmth and personal feel of a boutique hotel with all the offerings of a large hotel. In addition, the W also sits right at Union Square with an abundance of restaurants and easy access to transportation of all types to travel in NYC. Natalie and all the front desk staff were fabulous, and along with them all the bellman and doormen were delightful. In addition, the lovely W insider was so nice. The management worked hard along with the staff to make for another exceptional stay-kudos to Gerald and Rich.

I had done a lot of research prior to booking at the W because I planned to propose to my girlfriend (now fiance) last weekend on a surprise trip to New York. I wanted to stay at a nicer place in the city since it would be a special weekend, and the W seemed to fit the bill. I sprung for a ""corner"" room, and the views did not disappoint. My fiance was blown away - we typically stay at ""nicer"" hotels, but the W Union Square was definitely a notch or two above many of the nicer places we've stayed in the past. In particular, I thought the size of the corner room was extremely spacious. I travel to NYC often for business and have stayed at quite a few Starwood properties. However, most of those rooms have always been on the smaller side. The corner suite was really spacious and had plenty of room for us to move around. Not to mention the great views from all angles. My girlfriend was not as familiar with NYC as I, so when the bellman brought our bags to the room, he was gracious enough to come show us notable buildings and areas of town by pointing them out to us through our windows. Our second day into the trip, we decided to order room service by hanging the door tag with our orders on the door before we went to bed that night. Our breakfast was prompt and delivered to us on a cart that we were able to keep with us for the entirety of our ""breakfast in bed."" (I have to make a side note here - we loved hanging out in our robes provided in the room! Something about a nice white robe that fees so luxurious and comfortable.) The food was delicious, although a bit pricey (which is to be expected at any W hotel). We had the pancakes (they were as big as your head!we probably could have shared them - huge portion, you get your money's worth) and the french toast - both which were really tasty.We had a lot of help from the hotel on deciding what to do for the weekend. I already had a proposal planned for Saturday night, but we honestly felt a bit lost as to what we should do during the day before the ""big night."" There was one person in particular who was especially helpful named Mark Rafeld from the front desk. I had talked to him on the phone during booking and let him in on my secret of the upcoming proposal, and he promised they'd take special care of us on our trip. I was able to go and find Mark while my girlfriend was showering on Saturday morning, and he helped me to plan the perfect day sightseeing in New York and even helped recommend a good matinee broadway show for us to see as an additional ""surprise"" for my now fiance. He definitely went above and beyond helping me to find ways to make our weekend special, and my fiance was so surprised by all of the great things we did thanks to his help. In addition, thanks to Mark and the help of the front office team, after I proposed on Saturday night, we returned to our hotel room to find a congratulatory note from the staff and a bottle of champagne chilling in the room. What a nice touch! I've honestly never met a more friendly and helpful front office team. From the door, to the desk, to the concierge, everything about our stay at the W Union Sq was amazing. We will certainly be back.",,syllabus69,6,5.0

What this means is you can hop into any taxi and just say ""Union Square"" and you will get to within one block of the hotel. Wide taxi lanes around the Square means you can easily exit the cab at curbside, orient yourself and walk to this hotel sited at the corner of West 17th Street and Park Avenue. In Union Square you'll find subway lines A, C, E, R, N, Q and L. There are also surface buses running up and downtown, and the stop is right in front of the hotel.Citrus-flavored ice water is dispensed at the desk when you walk in. In the morning coffee takes its place. Umbrellas are available to guests if it is raining. Over our four night stay we asked for several items ranging from an additional refrigerator to scissors and slippers. All arrived at our door in less than ten minutes. The room was completely refreshed each day. One bottle of water was provided at no charge. None of the doors (closet, shower, entry) squeaked or caught when swung open. We couldn't return the iron to its holder after using it because its placement in the closet as somewhat awkward. But that was the only flaw in an otherwise wonderful Wonderful- class room, which featured three large mirrors, a deep window ledge and a very comfortable bed.The gym is in the basement and features four treadmills, two spin bikes, a weight machine and a set of free weights. Exercise balls and straps round out the equipment. The bikes and treadmills have video screens broadcasting movies, local TV and sport channels. individually wrapped headsets are provided along with terry-cloth towels, wet wipes, apples and clear cold water from a dispenser.Rounding out the hotel's amenities is its 'living room"", the lobby extension that runs from the reception area to the restaurant/bar. It fronts Park Street, with tall windows, a variety of seating and scattered outlets to power your devices. WiFi is free for two hours.Dining within a two-block radius is sublime. Don't settle for Starbucks; there are good places nearby. Ask the concierge for recommendations, Bernardo seems to have been born into the job. The Union Square Farmer's market operates three days of the week. Staying here will make you feel like a star, and make you realize why celebrities of the day preferred to live in hotels.","San Francisco, California","CityGuide4917</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",7,5.0

Everything was outstanding. Staff, service, location - everything was as expected.We noticed a pattern with the W hotels. I am not going to go into detail about what we did not like about the W hotels in downtown NYC, Chicago Lakeshore and W Union Square. Overall biggest fails, staff and their attitude, systems and procedures. I just wished they could get it right. It didn't happen at one hotel but at a number of W's. In fact all of the W's except the Washington Location. Understaffed, overworked, lack of desire to be at work, I don't know what it was!!! Still shaking my head!I was going to write a very long letter about all the issues we encountered at all the W's however, does anyone actually read the feedback? I have to say the bedding, and cleanliness of the hotels are always immaculate - I don't have an issue with that. It's the attitude of the staff and the inefficient service that rubs me the wrong way. I think we gave the W enough chances to redeem themselves. As Gold SPG members you would think that by now in this day and age If we request late check out - we wouldn't have been locked out of our room and having to provide ID in the middle of a hall way to security! A tip to the check in staff. Smiling is free - a welcoming face starts of a guests experience with a positive invitation to the hotel. - Maybe its a policy that the staff don't smile or that they don't give an overview of the hotel ie. gym, eating area etc. I don't know perhaps someone can inform me if that's a policy. Back to the Westin we go! - The staff smile, help you, advise you, give you information about the hotel and thank you for staying with the hotel.

Besides feeling welcome and comfortable this stylish hotel delivered wonderfully on its signature service – and as such the real “stars” of this hotel must be mentioned by name as follows:Silotte Dauphine: an elegant, stunning and lovely French Lady, whom we met at the Concierge Desk. She was warm, informative and provided us with helpful tips for getting around Manhattan -- Silotte provided each of us with complimentary fold- up “mini” umbrellas noting their convenience for being easy to tuck away, before escorting us to the subway to ensure that we took the “correct” train to Brooklyn. She went above and beyond!!Bernardo Reyes: very cool and knowledgeable Concierge with great personal style and accessories – He took the time to create a personal type-written itinerary with Fourth of July recommendations (delivered to our room) that was customized to our adventure. Not only did he deftly navigate multiple locations for cool Noho, Soho & Nolita, boutiques for us he directed us to the legendary ""cronut"" line up where we were lucky to receive the last 4 cronuts of the day!! “He gets us!”Tanya Decosta: a lovely young woman - also part of the Concierge Team who hit the nail on the head with her recommendations for cool shops (Brooklyn Charm) and places to go that our 17 and 13-year-old girls fully embraced.Stella Draksin-Okjan, Welcome Desk: Great energy Super Fun, hilarious and friendly, with great advice! We sent our girls to Big Daddy’s for breakfast upon her recommendation and tackled Central Park with ease based on her tips.Eddie Ruiz, Welcome Desk: very professional and on top of things, he generously relocated our room so that we could enjoy an even better view of the city.The common thread among each of these individuals is that they are truly authentic, clearly love what they do, have a generosity of spirit, are proud to offer their knowledge and services, and have a talent for seamlessly anticipating guests’ needs in an extremely pleasant, kind and informative manner. – BRAVO! Each of them are to be congratulated for their exemplary service. Together these shared intangibles make the difference between having a good stay or having a memorable experience. Because of them we will definitely recommend W Union Square to our friends and family, and we will of course return to this hotel in a flash.With very best wishes,Patty & Clarke (Toronto)Nicole & Ava (Calgary)","Toronto, Canada","Patty D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,4.0

The experience was beyond horrible. A couple of weeks before checking in, we called and spoke to a manager about having a bottle of sparkling wine placed in our room on our wedding night and then having juice brought from room service the next morning. The day we were supposed to check in, we received a voicemail from a hotel employee telling us we needed to call back to clarify our asks. When we did, we were passed among three different people, all saying with some level of rudeness or attitude that they didn't know what we were talking about. We finally spoke to a manager, who assured us that our requests would be taken care of.When I arrived at the hotel with two bags and my wedding dress, there was no one to assist me, not even one doorman to open the two heavy front doors going into the hotel. I had to wait for another guest to exit and ask for help with the doors so I didn't damage my dress.At the front desk, I was told my reservation could not be found. I said this was impossible because we had just spoken to a manager thirty minutes prior about our reservation. The manager overheard this and checked me in himself. He apologized for the confusion and said he was going to have a fridge with the juice we wanted brought to our room before we returned from our wedding, so that we didn't have to be disturbed the next morning. This was the fourth time we had discussed this request. Of course, no juice ever appeared at any point.But worst of all, by far, was the treatment when we returned to the hotel after our wedding. Our keys had stopped working, so we went to the front desk to get them reactivated. While we were there asking for help, a woman behind the desk shot us a very dirty look. I asked her why she was glaring at us, and she responded by rolling her eyes and then verbally attacking us—raising her voice and trying to start an argument. I could not believe someone was treating us this way at the end of our wedding night. I was shaking and practically in tears.We went to our room after asking her name (Tamara Fleurose), and the other person from the front desk delivered two glasses of Champagne to us to apologize for Tamara's behavior. Unfortunately, they were brought to us on a dinner plate rather than a tray, and one fell and shattered glass all over our hotel room floor.I usually stay at W Hotels about five times a year. After this experience—having someone be so incredibly rude to me on my wedding night—it will be very hard for me ever to consider the W as an option in the future.I also sent Katherine, the ""talent coach,"" an email about Tamara's behavior, but she never responded.","New York City, New York","amoore74</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",3,1.0

The location of the W can not be beat. We went to east village, shopping along 5th Ave,etc., shows in Times square, shopping at Macy's in Herald Square -- and all without needing a cab (except for one rainy night where we opted for a driver over a wet walk in the rain.) The staff at the W is very helpful and accommodating. Our room was large and comfortable. Beds were great, safe in room, large closet, nice bathroom amenities. The market next door is open 24/7 and has wonderful breakfasts, plus anything else you could need during a stay. I had two very minor complaints -- (1) the shower curtain needs to be hung on a curved rod -- it sticks to your body during a shower -- that is not a big deal at all but still no fun! (2) $14.95/day for WiFi. C'mon... wifi should be free these days. Again not a big deal. My biggest complaint is there was a distinct smell in the room. Some sort of air freshener scent that was extremely offensive to me. It actually kept me up the first night and made my eyes tear the second night. But, when I checked out I mentioned it to the gentleman at the front desk and he said I should have told him right away. Apparently this is the W's ""new scent"" and I could have specified to NOT have it sprayed in my room. Also, they could have run some sort of air purifier to remove the smell from my room OR changed my room for me. He told the manager who sent me a personal email apologizing for the inconvenience and gave me a discount on my stay as a gesture to make things right. That is the way to win a loyal customer, and I would now consider myself just that. Thank you W for a great (albeit slightly smelly) stay in NYC!

My husband who comes to NY on business recommended we stay here since Union Square is a good location, more of a local authentic NY experience and less tourists. We loved the hotel and location - the Farmer's Market every day outside the hotel, the Union Square Park and subway (only 4 stops to Times Square. Subway is at the diagonal corner of square from the hotel) and all the restaurants near by. It was walking distance to Greenwich Village, Madison Square, and my husband could bike along the river from hotel (he brought his bike). See my Union Square “Beats Time Square - Loved it! It has everything! Relaxation, food, shopping, convenience” review for more details on why Union Square beats Times Square. This hotel gives you the convenience and close to fantastic amenities without the mobs of tourists and crowded sidewalks. It gives you the fun and energy of NY while also giving you a slower, relaxing options as well.We stayed Memorial Day weekend for three nights on Starwood points. We would definitly return to the hotel and recommend it. We had great, prompt service at the hotel. From Eddie who checked us in and gave us a room overlooking Union Square and was friendly and professional to the maid who quickly got us a repairman to unplug our toilet (husband's fault; not the toilet's), and the service in the ""Living Room"" bar (get the coconut rum drink with pineapple and cranberry juice), it was all good. Cocktails were in the $13 range. The room was clean and decorated in blue and orange with black wooden, modern furniture that had space for clothes and shoes that you didn't want to bother putting in the closet drawers. Room was a normal size with a desk, desk chair, and a reading chair. Bathroom was a good size and the shower was big enough for three people. The glass doors are so much nicer than a shower curtain. Sink in the bathroom had plenty of room for my bag of cosmetics. Wonderful collection of the Bliss products (shampoo, conditioner, facial wash, lemon & sage bath gel, soap, shower cap with nail file and wooden tool for cleaning under the nails). Safe in the closet. Minibar fridge with warning that it does not chill like a normal fridge. We got 2 free bottles of Dasani bottled water for being Starwood Preferred Guests (1 each day). There was also $7 bottles of water you could buy. Go to the 24 hour CVS next door and you can buy a 6 pack of the same brand of water for the same price.We were on the 6th floor and could hear the traffic noise at night but I guess it is just part of the charm of staying in the big city and hearing the city sounds. No coffee maker in the room but Starbucks, Panera, and Dunkin Donuts, and delis are around the square. If you feel like walking a few blocks, Think Coffee and Joe The Art of Coffee are near by for a really good cup of coffee.The lobby doesn't have any chairs, just a front desk and a concierage. There were fresh green apples on the lobby desk. In the afternoon, there was fruit water and one morning, there was good coffee. No tea. There might have been coffee there other mornings but we didn't notice it. You can get breakfast delivered to your room and the restaurant is open for breakfast - dinner. Next door is a deli with pancakes and bacon for $7 and pretty good sandwiches (got one for the Amtrak train ride home). For breakfast, we normally went to the Farmer's market for fruit and a pastry and then walked to a coffee shop. Beware the street vendor selling fruit across the street from hotel. The rasperries were good and only $3, but he tried to give me only a $1 change when I gave him a $5 until I questioned him on it.Taking the subway to Penn Station to catch the Amtrak train, it took about 45 minutes from the hotel to the connecting station and then walking a few blocks to Penn Station.","Germantown, MD","ClaireWithLove</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Germantown, MD</strong>",365,5.0

The subway was only a two-minute walk.Our last meal before departing was at OLiVES in the lobby. I enjoyed the whipped ricotta ravioli and calamari. Next door to the hotel is a 24 hour CVS (kind of a like a Shoppers Drug Mart with a small grocery section for all you Canucks out there) and a place called Bread and Butter where you can pick up coffees and sandwiches. Both were good and reasonably priced. They also have booze for you hounds out there.The hotel concierge helped secure reservations at STK in the Meatpacking District, which was fully booked on Open Table a month prior (little did we know, it was because of the TriBeCa Film Festival). During dessert, our waiter presented us with Prosecco ""compliments of our concierge,"" which was a nice touch and impressed the client we dined with that night.The cab ride to the hotel from JFK was only $30.

Of the 4 current W's in NYC, best location to bars of various neighborhoods, avoiding the touristy Times SquareLooks: As you enter the main entrance, the party seeps out from the Living Room bar on your right. It's, as per usual for a W Hotel, dark and sexy. The check-in counter is straight ahead, in a slightly claustrophobic corner under the winding staircase.Amenities: The Living Room bar was definitely lively, with an open space to see and be seen. Very conducive for mingling, not so much for quiet canoodling. I did not get a drink here, but those velvet couches looked comfortable.Room: The room was small, but served its purpose as a place to sleep. I really liked the different textured wallpapers, and reptile-skinned details on the table and shoe bench. The TV was a large enough size to comfortably enjoy from bed, though you can definitely feel a slight draft from the window. I had at the awesome view of brick wall, and an alley.Verdict: For the price, I'd hope for a little better SPG Platinum recognition (at least a sincere welcome, but maybe that's a New Yorker thing to skip the pleasantries). But, really, you're here for a sexy room near other nightlife spots.

By the time we got inside to check-in, the bellman knew my children's names and they were fast friends. Very dear.2. We arrived early, expecting a wait for our room. No wait at all- room was ready.3. When our romantic getaway changed into a family trip last minute- we expected a problem given that we had booked a king room. They tried to Switch us to two doubles without my even asking- but we're unable to given that the hotel was full. Instead, they rolled a great cot to the room- it was perfect.4. It was pouring rain and cold- when we returned back to the hotel after exploring all afternoon, we enjoyed lovely cocktails in the lobby lounge while the kids were treated to the BEST hot cocoa ever. When we ventured out to dinner later that night- the bellman ran down the street in the rain to get us a cab at changeover time during a rain storm. We so appreciated it!5. The room was spacious and filled with all the great amenities you would expect from a W: great beds, towels, powerful shower and of course all the great bliss spa products.6. Brunch was divine. Red velvet pancakes...really?? Yum!Thank you, W Union Square!","Douglassville, Pennsylvania","msjebcat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Douglassville, Pennsylvania</strong>",12,5.0

Exercise room was small but adequate for what hotels offer. Rooms were comfy, make sure you put out your DND sign as housekeeping likes to make rooms up on the early side.

Our experience with the hotel staff was so great! Check-in went very smoothly and as we were heading to the elevators, we were greeted by one of the managers, Marc, who was aware it was my birthday and wished me a happy birthday! How kind of him! We got a room on the 11th floor with really great sunlight coming in from 3 huge windows. My bf later told me they were called picture windows and we had them facing East and South so we got great light all day! We had a nice view of union square and the park. The room was very modern with a day bed/couch, flat screen with tons of new movies still out in theaters that you could purchase, great BLISS amenities including face wash and good body lotion. The accents around the room and small pillows seemed edgy and cool and the room was very clean. Since we got there earlier in the day, we ended up going out to hang out and when we returned to change before dinner, I was greeted with a plate of treats including a bottle of natural spring water, cupcakes and chocolate covered strawberries, with the words ""Happy Birthday"" written on it with a personalized card from yet another manager, Bill. What a nice surprise! :)The staff was super friendly and helpful throughout our short stay. From the front desk to the bar, the managers and staff walking around, everyone was so professional and willing to assist in any way. Housekeeping was quick when extra towels were requested and we also (actually just I) got to get some additional BLISS products! I was sitting in the Olive bar lounge area waiting for my boyfriend at the bar and a staff member walked by and asked to make sure I was okay. It was very reassuring to find that the staff was so caring and welcoming! Even on our way out, the manager we first met, Marc, caught us, wished me a happy birthday again and wished us a safe trip home! He remembered! I would definitely come back again and recommend this hotel!!! Thanks again to Marc and the rest of the W hotel staff for making my birthday celebration a memorable one! =)",NY,"sleepiebabie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NY</strong>",38,5.0

The location can't be beat as a perfectly situated base for walking to all of the most interesting neighborhoods in Manhattan. I really like the design and vibe of this particular W. It's more subtle and less of a pretentious scene that many of its sister properties. I really like the recent redesign of the rooms. The color scheme and other design elements like the topographical wall panels are gorgeous. Staff is friendly and attentive.

First, the wonderful:- The STAFF. The doormen always remember us and are so pleasant and helpful and just nice welcoming guys. The front desk staff is always accomodating, Wherever/Whenever is great, and checking in, asking for additional amenties etc. is always easy. Marc Rafeld, now part of the management team at the W in Union Square is fantastic. I can't say enough great things about how he has treated my family, especially for my recent anniversary. We go to NY for all of our big celebrations, as we got engaged and ended our honeymoon there, and Marc has just made everything that much better. Hopefully his managers appreciate the caliber of employee they have. LOCATION: I'm not a fan of mid-town Times Square craziness. I love this location. Restaurants in the area are wonderful, your'e a quick walk to Soho, Chinatown, LES, Downtown, Grand Central. The Location has it all. Rooms: Nice rooms, recently re-furbished and good size by NY standards. Now for the good vs. Wonderful: The price. Rooms are on the expensive side, but deals can be found. Beyond that I have no negatives to add. Any time I have ever had an issue in the tens of times we've stayed there it's been resolved. Marc, the front door staff, the welcome desk are all great.

Our son's apartment is around the corner so we wanted to be close by - we usually stay in mid-town when we come to NYC so staying in Union Square was a change for us. We had a 'cozy' suite on the 11th floor - you could definitely hear the traffic - so next time I would request a higher floor. The price for this accommodation in NYC was fantastic - I think the value is incredible for the price. The main room was very large and spacious - funky fun furniture - the bathroom, likewise, was a nice size. The bedroom was smaller - but just fine since we had the living space. I loved the bath products - especially the Bliss body butter - a super nice surprise since usually the bath products at hotels are not something you really want to use! in this case, however, in dry wintry NYC I needed more moisturizer than I brought and loved the product. The staff was very nice and responsive - even with a jammed packed hotel they recognized me every time I came past the front desk by name - so great customer service there. I had breakfast in the restaurant - the menu is small - not a great breakfast. We had a mix of service there - one excellent young lady and one very rude young man. Beyond that service glitch and the annoyance of having to pay for internet in your room (paying for internet in hotels is a pet peeve of mine - annoying!

Memories of the W in LA and St Petersburg include a catwalk fashion show on repeat in the elevator along with club music; rooms in all white with funky (but impractical) furniture; staff too cool for school and just a lot of pretension. For all of these reasons I avoid the W but this one at Union Square was different.I honestly could have been at just a Sheraton - a tarted up Sheraton. This appears to be a historic building that is a bit darker but beautiful high ceilings and pretty good sized rooms for New York. The lobby bar was nice but I didn't get a headache walking into the lobby, flghting my way through clubbers and partyers - nice.The rooms were pretty plain for a W but that was fine with me - good sized everything - good lighting and pretty standard, generic furniture relatively speaking. There was no pretension in the room, just a lot of practicality. Excellent heating system, nice view over Union Sq - not much more to ask for. Only complaint was the hot water took a long time to heat up. We arrived early for check-in on Sunday. The hotel was full from the night before and we couldn't check in until much later - no problem. Margie was fantastic and a real asset to the company, remembering my name from first encounter to check-out. She is fantastic and so was the encounter with other staff members.Fitness room is pretty modest but did the trick. Breakfast at Olives was nothing special and service was a bit off but no big deal.Definitely no value add items at W - need an umbrella? Pay for it in the room. Want some water - that'll be $9. You get more free stuff at the Sheraton and this is a less glam brand. In conclusion, a good hotel in a great location. This W is the chain's ugly sister and definitely if you want glam, this is not the W for you. If you want good hotel keeping, this one is a keeper.","Singapore, Singapore","Andrew W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",277,4.0

I love its location - it's fairly central with lots of great stuff nearby either walking or biking (CitiBikes!) distance. Plus, it's away from the madness that is Times Square. I do think this W is lacking on the service side. I felt that staff in the lobby weren't that friendly. For example, it bugged me that no one was there to grab the door as they say me approaching, lugging my suitcase, in the rain! The rooms I've stayed in have been on the larger side, especially by New York standards. Although based on the other reviews I've read, I might have just picked the right room at booking. The rooms are clean on the surface, but try not to look too deep because you're bound to find flaws. With all my stays, I've encountered open candy wrappers under the bed and dirty bathroom mirrors. Relatively minor, but you also try not to think too much into it (I mean, if they missed that, what else have they missed...).Given the option, I'd chose another hotel option in NY (to be honest, I've found a new favorite in town anyways). This place just doesn't match my W/SPG expectations. If you ended up staying there too for whatever reason, it's not the end of the world either. Like I said, I do love the location. And while service could be friendlier, you're not spending your timing socializing in the lobby.

Love the refurb which expanded the bar area into the restaurant. Alas, the W Union Square’s decline in service is akin to what we’ve noticed at all W hotels we’ve visited in the past year. Prior to 2013, the W has been our favorite SPG brand, with this property being our hands-down favorite. In fact, we experienced such exemplary service last December that I wrote a letter of commendation to SPG regarding their staff and management and have rated them as a ‘5’ in two previous TripAdvisor reviews. Well, we’ve stayed 3 more times since then, and alas much has changed in a year. Gone is the big front desk SPG Platinum “welcome” and friendly check-in conversation that always started us off on a stellar note. We were assigned a Spectacular King room, which was exactly what we booked -- no big surprise as we’ve never received an upgrade at W properties as a Platinum member. We normally bring the kids and book two doubles, so this was our first king room and I was very disappointed. While the bedroom is similar, the bathroom was extremely “blah” – nothing special at all. Worse yet, the room wasn’t the cleanest and not well equipped -- dusty baseboards and window frames and no coffee maker. Plus the “new” décor is not my cup of tea, leaving me longing for the pre-refurbishment espresso furniture and purple satin linens. Elevators were not stopping at every floor, forcing some folks to the stairs. After reporting it to multiple staff members the previous evening, it was still not fixed by 11am the following morning. Check out was strangely unprofessional for a supposedly luxury boutique hotel. No inquiry regarding our experience; just a simple “do you need your bill printed” and “I need your valet ticket to stamp it,” even though my husband had given the ticket to valet and was already loading luggage. We have two more W stays booked for the month of December, one of which is at this property. Although we’ve been SPG loyalists for almost 5 years now, we’ve been seriously disappointed with their service at multiple properties on way too many occasions this year (with the exception of the Sheraton brand, whose service has been far superior to our experiences at the Westin, W, and Le Meridien properties all year). If things don't improve, 2014 will most definitely be our last with the program.","Leesburg, Virginia","Marie C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Leesburg, Virginia</strong>",13,3.0

We were in town for a rock show at Irving plaza ( which was only a short walk away) and we were blown away by the proximity of the hotel to almost everything.The hotel is expensive,but you really do get what you pay for (Ecsp. in the city), the rooms were large for NYC standards, and very quiet, it was clean and there were high end soaps in the bathroom, you can tell they tried their best to make your stay special.( I recommend the ""Olive Burger"" from the room service menu, it was HUGE and fresh and really hit the spot. :) )The bed was to die for, I didn't want to get out of it, if there was a way to fit it in the car home I would!! All in all it was an amazing weekend, and we will definitely be staying there again on our next trip to NYC. The one thing I can say about the hotel negatively is that although it is super secure ( you need your key to get almost everywhere!! really made me feel safe!) A very intoxicated homeless man got in the elevator with us (it would have been rude and presumptuous to kick him out, left us in a weird spot!), he was making vulgar remarks toward me and it was uncomfortable, if my fiancee wasn't there I wouldn't have felt safe. With a nightclub downstairs, and being located on a busy street, there has to be a way to make sure people who are in the elevators are allowed there. I mean it was the weekend, at night, in the city, so I was partly to blame, but it was rather uncomfortable. That being said, the bad experience wouldn't sway me from staying there again.

There were no doorman or porter helping with our luggage. After struggling with 4 bags past the heavy doors, there were no offers from the receptionist to help with our luggage. The room decoration is not up to the usual standard of a W Hotel, it sadly need a make over. The air conditioning outlet was half blocked by the curtain and it was loud. The ground floor bar is hip but the lack of insulation made it very loud and impossible to have a conversation. The drinks were experience and the rest rooms are a long flight of stairs up to the first floor. Not pleasant after a few drinks. The guest room is poorly insulated as you can hear plumbing noise from adjoining bath rooms, including the flushing of toilets and guests taking a shower. The nightmare started the second morning, as I was taking a shower, the toilet bowl started to overflow onto the bathroom floor. It was like watching a horror movie when urine was overflowing on to the floor. It was disgusting and most unhygienic, I had to get out of the shower, stepping on the overflown floor to get dressed and call the reception. A maintenance man did turn up pretty quickly. By this stage, we had enough of it, we packed up quickly and asked to be put to another room. First of all, the receptionist tried to tell me that there were no vacant room, having stood at the reception for a good 10 minutes, he found a vacant room 2 floors above which was reserved for other guests. There were no offer of help to move our luggage. The nightmare gets worse, the acoustic insulation in this room is even worse. We could hear every guests walking past outside the corridor and the plumbing noise again. Yes the nightmare continues, toilet flushing, other guests tuning taps on and off. You can hear everything. To top it off, we could hear a coupe arguing, door slamming and shouting in the middle of the night. That's not the end of it. As I was taking a shower, the toilet bowl starts to fill up again....... At this point in time, we have had enough, we packed up immediately, checked out and checked into the Intercontinental Hotel.

They offered to move us to the W in Times Square, but it was 9PM on a Saturday, and we had already parked the car so it would have taken way to long to drive to Times Sq and getting situated there.They gave us a bigger room with a king size bed (couldnt tell the difference) so they could fit 2 beds that they delivered to us once we got upstairs. This was kind of a bummer because I was excited to sleep on a hotel bed and ended up sleeping on a cot.Didnt comp us anything for the mistake. Wifi was $6 for a half an hour. crazy. We only stayed one night so there was no issues we were happy with the room other than the mistake. Doorman was actually quite rude, he asked 'do you need a cab?' and started looking for one, and as he was trying to get one he turned around and yelled 'you know i dont do this for free, i get tips!!' Okayyy.... never did we say we weren't going to tip him or gave that impression. But really? We are paying $700/night for this hotel and thats the way you're going to speak to me?? We ended up getting our own within 5 minutes because I really wanted nothing to do with him. This is why I give it a 3.. which is actually quite a shame because I loved the hotel. Sorry! It would have gotten a 5 if it wasnt for the rude doorman and if they had comped us something (even a free appetizer at the restaurant) for messing up the room.

Great dining options all around and a Baby's R Us right next door for all our Baby needs!! Now the hotel itself is getting a bit old and the refurbishment that has been carried out may not be to everyone's taste..the bright colors that they have used in the rooms contrast with the old building creating a bit of a mish mash of designs...especially the blues,oranges and white's in the rooms...The house keeping is on the slower side which is expected in some of the larger hotels I guess...but we had to call and remind them twice for the evening turn down service.This wasn't half as bad as the door men!!Don't expect the Door men at the W for most parts to help you with the door even if you are juggling a stroller, a baby car seat a pizza box and a baby!! There was one Door man out of three who was helpful and friendly but unfortunately I cannot remember his name. The other doormen just hang around the front of the building. Now the front desk is not all that friendly either, except for the gentleman who checked us in I think his name was Leonard...who was genuinely friendly and caring the rest of them seemed to be in a world of their own. We have stayed in so many Hotels around the world and have never seen such indifferent service....In most hotels these days the staff at the front desk and most anywhere in the hotel wish the guests with a friendly greeting throughout the day, which makes guests feel at home and welcome...but here the front desk which looks straight at the bay of elevators that guests use all day rarely make eye contact with any of the guests even when they are not serving guests and are seemingly oblivious to where they are and what they are expected to do..which is be welcoming and friendly to your guests...hospitality is what its all about. I found my self looking eagerly at the staff ready with a ""thank you"" or ""you too"" in response to a ""have a nice day"" or ""a good morning"" or a smile...but couldn't get them to even acknowledge my presence...anyway I think the W team has to look into this as guests are used to a lot more these days.... a great location can only keep us coming back so many times.

I had booked for 8 nights, paid 100% upfront and requested a high room. I was given a room on the 4th floor above the club. Noisy, which is exactly what you want after a long trans-Atlantic flight and hours of standing in line at JFK. Nothing else was available, but they promised to move me te next day to a higher room. If I left my bags packed an 'ambassador' (not my word) would move my things between 2 and 3 pm. When I returned at 3.30 pm nothing had been moved and no I had not been assigned a higher room. But if I waited another hour they would see what they could. It was time to show some muscle. I insisted on seeing the manager. At long last things started to move once I mentioned TripAdvisor. I was immediately assigned a room on the 17th floor. I was given a discount on the first night and fruit, cheese and a bottle of wine were sent up to my room, followed by two phopne calls to check all was ok. (The power of TripAdvisor!).... After this things were fine. I like the rooms, they are roomy and have personality. I had a great view of Union Square. The staff are friendly, especially Mark and Mickey. Front desk is sometimes good and sometimes understaffed. In the evenings the bar/lounge areas are full of young hip things, so if that's your scene, go for it. The location is SUPERB. Breakfast is good (except on the last morning they had no Earl Grey teabags and no English muffins). I would visit again and next time role up my shirt sleeves to show my biceps sooner.

Our trip started ominously enough when our flight was canceled from Chicago to Newark. We called the hotel and they amended our reservation from three nights to two which was awesome. To not make us have to pay for the 3rd night and not cancel our reservation entirely was a huge lift. We got out the next day early and when we went to check in they were able to find us a room. This was so helpful as we were exhausted from the last 24 hours of trying to get a flight out. I would describe the hotel as well suited for New York. It's in an old building, but modernized. It's not big, but what do you expect in NYC. Our room was on the 20th floor and had an awesome view of Union Square and downtown. Every question we asked the staff was answered thoroughly. The only issue we had was at checkout. When we checked in, the person at the front desk offered us a late check out since our flight was at 9p. He said we could have until 5p, but on Sunday we were told that late check outs only go until 4p and we were asked who we spoke with. I didn't get his name at check in, but I'm sure they could have looked up who took care of us (maybe not, but still - does that matter?). We were out by 515p anyway, but it seemed strange to doubt us.

The hotel is in a terrific Manhattan neighborhood and we had a spacious Mega King room on the 19th floor. While the height didn’t eliminate all street noise, it certainly helped in that regard. Even better, the hotel’s interior is extremely quiet; no disturbances from our neighbors’ TV, or loud talk, etc. I assume this has to do with the original construction having occurred back when builders used superior materials. Whatever the cause, it was certainly welcome.My wife and I are seniors, and she has some significant health challenges, so I wrote ahead to inform the hotel of our situation. The response was all we could have hoped: giving us the room near the top; making it hypoallergenic; scheduling multiple trips for us using the Acura service. All of which leads me to the main point: the W’s staff is simply outstanding at all levels. The good humor, pleasant demeanors, and dedication to customer service were evident every time we made a request or encountered a staff member. There seems to be nothing they’re unwilling to do to make a guest’s stay more pleasant. As a result, we felt very well taken care of.Is the hotel perfect? Of course not. The closets and drawer space weren't really adequate. And, like others, we had to work to remove the charge for the “free” hospitality item we were given by the concierge.

The hotel is well serviced and the rooms nice. We chose a large room. If you are staying for more than a few nights, the extra cost of a larger room is well worth it. New York hotel rooms are known to be generall very small. The bathroom was also quite large and had a full sized bath and separate shower. We also enjoyed being on the top floor.

(repair man came, really nice can't remember his name but his accent was strong either from queens or the bronx. regardless, we had to change rooms!)-The compensation offered was not really offered (We were told that we would get 2 free movies by the front desk, and had to really argue it with the front desk, then escalate it with a manager at check out)-Front lobby sprays scent out like some old lady's perfume (regardless it smelled bad, it is also toxic chemicals, these are not organic essential oils here, so not good for anyone's health! It really is not needed. A routinely cleaned and well maintained lobby that has air flow is all that is needed.)-Loud Club music in the elevators (bit awkward for anyone other than the 20 something clubber, makes me wonder what kind of image hotel is looking for, and who exactly are they trying to cater to. This did make me nervous staying here as i was expecting a party hotel. Apparently it was only a party in the elevators for the clubbers. Everyone else just had to grin and bear it. Personally some neutral jazz or relaxed lounge music or such would make the image of the hotel seem 'classier' not so cheap, and cater can any crowd. Something to think about, image is important.)- Air conditioning on our floor was stuck at super freezing (despite our repeated attempts to have it changed to the rest of the hotel, it was a daily/nightly quick dash to the hotel room door off/on the elevator).- Extremely long check out (we're talking about close to an hr! Not sure what happened, there were people there, but not that many, plus the front desk wanted to charge us for the movies again, and had to wait for a manager to finish talking about the following week's schedule (yep i overheard), which made us miss our breakfast.

I'm sure she was impressed by the hotel front desk staff as well. My spouse also forgot her work blackberry charger and the front desk charged this phone for her just about every night while we were out to dinner.Throughout our week long stay the housekeeping department did a fantastic job in making our rooms look perfect every day. We had my teenage daughters in one of our room so I'm sure that room was a daily challenge. During our stay every encounter at the front desk was always handled by attentive and caring staff. I also wanted to thank Jose at the front door and Aisha/George at the concierge desk for assisting me with detailed suggestions of how best to use every minute of our time in NYC.

I better explain!........I happen to like a music group called ""The Kills"" and your house music featured them from time to time so one day while waiting for my family to come to the lobby I decided to ""film"" this music coming out of the elevator speaker to document this (I'm from ""Music City""..we do strange things like this!) and when I stepped off the elevator I was met by a large gentlemen who is obviously on top of things in your hotel and cares about keeping your hotel and it's guests/staff safe. When I explained, he smiled, said he understood and I thanked him for being there watching out for questionable actions like the one I just did! I do have his voice on that video clip which is the name the clip now! ""What Are You Doing!""....I'll send him residuals if it makes any money anywhere. Kidding, it's for personal use...I'm one of the few folks from Nashville that is NOT involved in the music industry. I'm just a fan.The fruit bowls placed in our rooms the night before our departure were wonderful and so appreciated!Checkout went smoothly, the bell person arranged two taxis at departure, one going local to Brooklyn for my daughter who attends classes at The New School and another taxi for us to go back to Newark. We only went 50mph through the Lincoln Tunnel on the way back to Newark Airport and had a smooth, on time flight on SWA back to Nashville where we will suggest everyone we know traveling to NYC to consider staying at the W Hotel on Union Square.Take Care!Nolan PittmanNashville, TN","Nashville, Tennessee","nolan p</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nashville, Tennessee</strong>",1,5.0

As you are likely to eat every meal out, and are quite probably out of the hotel from early until late, you just aren't going to have the usual hotel experience. Unlike other recent reviewers we found that we had virtually no interaction with the staff except for check-in and check-out. No-one we encountered in the bar or restaurant had the slightest idea whether we were staying in the hotel or not. For us, we had a room in New York and that was it. Now, it was a very good room, don't get me wrong... we were in a very large room on the 21st floor; the bed linen was delicious; lots of nice products in the bathroom and, as pointed out by others, the location right on Union Square is fantastic. However, the room rates are high, and given that there is little ""value-added"", I would go back to On The Ave (OTA) on the Upper West Side next time I'm in New York. Rooms here were also very good (though without the nice products) and prices were much more reasonable. I believe that this was once billed as a no-services hotel explaining the reasonable rates. I see that it now boasts 2 restaurants, which was not the case when I stayed here a couple of years ago. But who needs hotels restaurants in NYC? All you need is a nice room and the rooms at OnThe Ave are perfectly nice enough without the big bill.

The hotel is quirky as it has many rooms and a small lobby which means sometimes the front desk can be overloaded.

Keep in mind that Union Square is on the cusp of the East and West Village as well as being close to Soho and Murray Hill. It is a big subway transit hub for downtown NY as well....So you can get anywhere! The rooms, and I have been in many of them, are quirky. Some of them are weirdly shaped and others have windows higher off the ground etc. The hotel used to be an insurance company building before being converted...so some rooms have strange corners or angles etc. I think it adds to the charm. Cleanliness was great, beds super comfortable, and if you are lucky enough to have the Union Square view....looking over the park to the green of the trees is fabulous. Within a few blocks there are 30+ restaurants and bars...and the food prices downtown, I find to be far cheaper then uptown.

The hotel is in a great location and has been well updated/maintained. Rooms are quite large for New York and function facilities are beautiful. Service at the front desk upon check in and check out was terrific. My one complaint is the ice machines. When I first I arrived, I noticed a loud beeping coming from the machine across the hall from my room. I called the W concierge desk and they said they'd send someone right up, but the noise continued all night. The next night, I noticed the same beeping and called the front desk instead. They actually did send someone to fix the beeping within fifteen minutes. I mentioned the experience upon checkout and the front desk person apologized profusely. She also offered my some SPG points for the inconvenience. When I got home, I had an email from the Director of Front Desk Operations also apologizing for the experience. I thought that was a nice touch and showed that my complaint was escalated and addressed.

Just walking into the hotel I felt at ease and excited from the great vibes in living room bar area, stylish lobby, and vibrant Union Sq. location. Staff at check-in couldn't have been nicer, and despite a short wait, they were extra gracious and even called my room minutes after I walked in to apologize for the delay and make sure I had what I needed. The room was clean, stylish, and the king bed was so comfortable. I love those pillows so much. In the morning before the event, I wanted a cup of coffee while getting ready and was a little disappointed to find they removed the coffee makers they used to have and instead offered complimentary coffee in the lobby, but I just didn't want to go down there in my pjs. Not a deal-breaker but it seems so standard at hotels these days it surprised me. I had room facing the park which is a reminder of what a great location this hotel is in - unlike the more soul-less mid-town area, it has character and so many restaurants, bars, and shopping within walking distance. Staying there with colleagues it was nice to be able to pop down to the loungey living room bar for a drink before going out or after dinner. When staying in NYC location is so key and staying somewhere you can call home-base between outings- this is it.

Excellent location, decent sized rooms, great 'reactive' service and comfortable beds. We were ;looking forward to our stay in the W Hotel as it was our first trip as a family to NYC. We stayed for five nights with a one year old and checked in late at night at about midnight. I'd called ahead requesting for a baby cot and had informed that we will be checking in quite late at night after a long flight from England and will prefer if that was already in the room along with a glass bowl. I needed it to sterilise bottles in milton fluid. None of this was in our room or even in their records as having been requested. We finally settled in after 90 mins minus the glass bowl but were too tired to pursue. The room turned out to have some problem with its heating and we were up in a few hours as a result. Next day we were moved to another room which was bigger and we agreed to pay the difference in price. Had to pursue housekeeping for a whole three hours to get the glass/ceramic bowl finally but to their credit they went and bought one as they didn't have any available in their kitchen (which I found very strange). The carpets in the room and general cleanliness isn't adequate for a hotel of this stature - For three days in a row our room wasn't cleaned until 5 pm and sometimes 7 pm and on all occasions we had to wait in the bar area for them to do a hurried unsatisfactory cleaning job ... Not ideal after a long tiring day in the cold with a one year old ... On complaining to the manager before check out, they offered to add some points to my husband's starwood membership - but that is yet to be delivered !

The king bed was very comfortable and provided a good night's sleep. The bar/restaurant downstairs looked busy on the Friday and Saturday nights we spent there, although we didn't go. Now for some constructive feedback...The biggest issue I had was that the walls sounded like they weren't insulated at all - we could hear EVERYTHING going on in the rooms around us, which was really bad. Our view was toward Brooklyn, which was fine, but I wish the window had been bigger! It was pretty tiny and located high on the wall in a corner. I was also surprised to see that Olives (the restaurant) had a B rating from the NYC Dept of Health - NOT impressed.

I was so nervous prior to our trip because our previous trips to NY with just 2 kids had been rather difficult. We had previously stayed at 2 different hotels in Times Square…but the small rooms just didn't have sufficient space for our double stroller, crib, etc. Now keep in mind, I'm a New Yorker. i was born and raised in NY and lived there until I got married at the age of 27. But vacationing in NY with 2 young kids isn't easy…and I couldn't imagine doing it with 4.Well, let me start by saying I am already planning our next vacation in NY for this summer...and we've only been home for 3 days. The staff at the W Union Square really knows how to make a guest feel valued and they will do ANYTHING they can to make your stay as easy and enjoyable as possible. They worked around my schedule to clean my room each day...even cleaning my room after 5 pm one day. On 3 occasions they gave me an evening vacuum (my kids got crumbs all over the floor). Anything I needed they brought me quickly and with a smile. Even the doormen went above and beyond, interacting with my kids to the point that my oldest son ran up to one of the doormen as we were packing up to leave and gave him a huge hug. The rooms are spacious and well designed, and the neighborhood is amazing. There is a HUGE playground right across the street. Union Square has a great farmer's market, and is surrounded by every store you could possibly need. There is a CVS right next to the hotel, a Babies R Us on the next block, a supermarket at the other end of Union Square, every type of cuisine you could possibly want, and much, much, much more. In fact, my 3 year old broke his glasses at the playground. I got on my phone and found an eyeglass shop one block away. We immediately walked over and got his glasses fixed (for FREE) and then went right back to the park. In addition, many buses and trains come into Union Square, so getting around is a piece of cake (unless you have 4 young kids like me…and then you'll just walk everywhere!!!).

The rooms are much bigger than other Ws in NYC area. It is an older building but the recent renovation makes the room very comfortable. Location: Union Square. Short walk to subway stations, easy connection to Grand Central Station for JFK Connections too.Lobby: Currently they are renovating the lobby but even though it is in an older building so it doesn't seem as chic as W New York - Time Square, but the high ceiling makes this W feels totally different from other Ws nearby.Room: Stayed at cool corner one bedroom suite for two nights. The Suite itself is divided into a separate bedroom and living room. Living room features a full sofa and HDTV. Modern/hip furniture yet very comfortable. Bathroom have separate shower and tub. Excellent shower pressure. Bedroom faces Union Square and totally refurbished. Excellent W Bed that I sleep everyday at home too. Room have very high ceiling too so the open feeling is very unique for NYC hotels. However, the AC/Heater was a bit problematic during my stay. Also due to the older building, sound insulation can be bad so if you are in corner locations like me, you may have hard time to sleep at night if you are a light sleeper. Service: Definitely have rooms for improvement. The people at Wheels are the best. Acura car service is a primary reason that I choose W hotel over other brands in NYC area. Loved the people that works there. They seems to enjoy their job too. However the doorman definitely needs some attention as I caught him few times texting on his phone instead of helping other guests with doors and/or luggage. Front desk/Concierge can be a bit cold depending on who you encountered but generally good. Overall, although this hotel priced higher than other Ws in the city, it is still my favorite W to stay at.","Dortmund, Germany","Doraemon79</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dortmund, Germany</strong>",146,4.0

Since I am a platinum member we were upgraded to a slightly larger room - which was really good size - especially for NYC - very clean and comfortable with a view of Union Square.The staff were pleasant. My only quibbles are minor and probably snotty - I was not really given the greeting and welcome I am used to as a platinum member and nothing was offered as an amenity or added bonus as it usually is when I check into a Starwood property.Overall though- we will definitely be back - as the location, comfort of the rooms and cleanliness outweighs my spoiled attitude.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","DC_Traveler46</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",27,4.0

This time I also got to use the Acura car service. I think that is a nice perk and a cool feature. The only points I would share for continued improvement:-The scent they use seems to be in heavy use these days.

From the moment I checked-in to the moment I checked out the stay could not have been improved upon. The attentive and friendly service began with the doorman, continued with the front desk, and on to the bellman. I wish I had the names of each and every staff member in order to compliment them here.The front desk representative may have been a mind reader, because before I could even ask to break a twenty dollar bill, she was already asking what demoninations would I like (she has been working the front desk for 13 years and made my 3/8 arrival at 12:30 PM very easy, including an upgraded room). The bellman, David Del Valle, was a delight. His warm personality, smile, and genuine desire to help make the stay enjoyable came shining through. The concierge, Nova Mejia, was so helpful and truly thoughtful each and every time I asked for assistance with restuarants and places to visit. She was delightful and so pleasant. Also, the front desk representative ( a young woman from Florida, who works the overnight shift) and Alex, the bellman, could not have been more helpful or pleasant when I needed additional housekeeping services. Truly with a staff like the W Union Square has, the hotel itself would not have to be great, but it is!The building itself is beautiful. The early 20th century look is wonderful and the decor of the lobby and rooms, hallways, and elevator areas are updated yet completely keep the feel of the original building. Down to the tile work in the floors by the elevator echoed in the tile work in the bathroom of the room, the hotel decor is fabulous. The lobby/lounge area just off Olives, the hotel bar and restaurant, is perfectly done in tones of blue, gray, and black with sofas, chairs, and tables that evoke the age of the building while being completely updated and fresh. The same holds true for the lovely large room/suite that I had. It was beautifully appointed, comfortable, fresh, clean, and well thought out. The bath had both a shower and tub, and very nice, soft, large bath towels that were actually large enough to call a bath sheet. The ammenities were great. The shampoos, soaps, body lotions, face cleanser were great and excellent quality. The availability in the bathroom of a disposable razor, a toothbrush with toothpaste, a shower cap, q-tips, nail file, and cotton balls was a great touch. The bed was very comfortable and I was able to sleep well. Complaints about noisy or small rooms at the W New York Union Square are somewhat silly. New York City is noisy and hotel rooms are usually small. The W actually has quite large rooms when considering the location. For New York City the room was huge, especially for the price. If you are planning to go to NYC, I would suggest giving the W New York Union Square a try.","Rockville, Maryland","FT1975</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rockville, Maryland</strong>",6,5.0

Another positive at this hotel is that all the rooms are very large by NYC standards. They have big windows and high ceilings. It is also cool to stay in a very old NYC building.Unfortunately that is where the positives end. Compared to other W's the beds here were very inconsistent. Most other W's I've stayed in have a comfortable feather bed on top of the mattress, and very comfortable pillows. The beds here sometimes had that, sometimes did not. One room I stayed in had an awful plastic wrap around the bed that was noisy and uncomfortable. Another issue I encountered on multiple stays was an awful smell in some of the rooms. It smelled like what I thought was mold. Some of the rooms had an unbearable smell (2101 being one of them) and others had no offensive smell at all. This leads me to the staff. Some of the front desk staff were amazing and helpful. However one front desk staff in particular was incredibly rude. When two weeks in a row I complained of a smelly room and requested to move he suggested that ""Maybe this hotel just isn't for you."" Um, W's aren't supposed to literally stink!

That's it. Now for the positive.From the time we arrived (which was early for check-in) we were treated with respect by the friendly staff. Our room was on the 16th floor, so it was nice and quiet. It wasn't the greatest view, but it was so high up that you could still see for blocks. The room was large by NYC standards, and The W is famous for it's cool, modern decor. You can adjust the temp in the room, which is always appreciated. You can plug your iPod into the dock/player on the nightstand. And how's this for a nice touch – the bedside table lamps have several built-in outlets so you're not crawling around on the floor looking for a place to plug in your devices. Someone else wrote that the bathrooms needed updating, I think they're fine. The towels were fluffy, the pillows and bedding were great. The goodies in the room are a nice selection, even tho they're way overpriced.We did not try the room service, but we did hang out in the lobby for a bit, and we had a glass of wine at the Olive bar. The location is just awesome, I love Union Square.I would definitely stay here again.

Because we have a pet we needed a pet friendly hotel but also wanted a hotel with a generator. I called the W union sq to inquire about both and was told as long as our dog is less than 40 lbs (she is close to that weight) it's ok. Also like every hotel, they are required to have a generator. As we checked in, the front desk agent said they did have a generator and that to her surprise, it covered everything (not just elevator and emergency light). The following review takes into consideration the extreme nature of Sandy. - everywhere in the hotel, the staff was wonderful, a lot of them had to sleep at the hotel because they couldn't go home and stayed to help the guests. THANK YOU. - We wanted a larger room because we knew we might be inside for a couple days so we booked a corner suite, it was nice and indeed large. - very large desk area to work, good wifi (free)- nice Bliss products in the bathroom- coffee by front desk dailyNow here is the negative, most of them would have been the same regardless of the storm, some not. - why, oh why, more and more hotels feel the need to spray fragrances in the rooms. It really was too much, some people are allergic and we spent most of the day with the windows open to air the room, please stop doing this or offer rooms without it for people allergic. - long hair on face towel in the bathroom, very hard to miss, should have not been there (see photo)- The windows are too thin or not properly sealed and you can really hear a lot of street noise, not for light sleepers (even with such a great mattress)- TV's are flat screens, fairly recent but these days they should have either HDMI input or the desk should have some sort of input connectors to work with HDMI to plug in your laptop or iPad - not enough lighting in the bedroom part of the suiteNow, storm related part of the review. - As soon as the power went out, the general manager came on the intercom system to explain what was happening, etc even giving us his cellphone if we needed help- A large bottle of Fiji water was left in front of the door of each room with a note on how to contact their whatever/whenever dpt- Generator kept the elevators working and lights in staircase and hallways (except 7th floor), BUT did not allow for water pump to work so no running water. We had planned and had flashlights. - Olives offered some cold food for people who wanted some and in the morning after the storm they had bagels, etc. The morning after the hurricane, staff was going door to door to rebook guests in other Starwood properties, we decided to go home. Regardless of what happened during the storm (the hotel was great in how they handled it), I wouldn't recommend someone to stay there because of the few negatives, some pretty important). A hair on a towel is not the end of the world, though it's not acceptable but noise and fragrance in room is a big no.

For goodness sake if you are going to use them then get the bar that extends so when you are lathering up with soap the gross nasty curtain doesn't stick to your body. Plus the hooks were broken all but 3 of the 12 were in working order. Majorly ambarassing for a hotel that TRIES TO ACT hip.

I chose the W Union Square because it was within walking distance of my NYC office. Nice enough but not great.! The front desk staff was not as friendly as other W Hotel front desk staff have been to me. They were very indifferent. I wasnt greeted by name and I had to ask them to seek an upgrade for me (they should let me know if one is available and not make me ask). Surprise! No upgrade available. I actually had a very nice room but the shower door handle from the inside was missing. Imagine being in your hot morning shower and realizing that you cannot get the actual shower door closed. I did the best I could, leaving it open about an inch (resulting in water getting all over the shower mat and floor, making it slippery upon my exit), I also wasnt asked what newspaper I wanted delivered to me in the morning and should have been. So, my first morning, I cannot close the shower door, I have no newspaper. Life isnt rough, I can manage. Not the hugest deal in the world. I head downstairs to spend the day in my NYC office and on my way out I stop at the front desk and mention to them that I didnt receive a newspaper and that I have no way of closing my shower door. The front desk person apologized and said she would send someone right up to fix it for me. Yay, on my way to work and forget about my absent shower handle and missing newspaper. Flash forward to 6:30 PM- back from a long day at the office and head to my room. Guess what? The shower door remains unaddressed. Nothing fixed. I called the front desk and they again apologized and sent one of the engineers up to ""look at it."" Up comes the engineer to ""look at it"" and he says, ""Oh yes, there is no handle. Let me see if I can find a handle for you and fix that. Ill have to look around."" Off he goes. Surprise! no follow up and no shower handle. I have to take another morning shower with the shower door open and then spend another morning cleaning up the wet floor as a result of it. Seriously, W? How hard is it to fix something like this? Why did I have to repeatedly ask for assistance only to never receive any resolution? Also, my sheets had stains on them, blood stains i think. Not mine, either. You could tell the sheets were clean but seeing someone elses blood stain on them was unnerving. I will note that the room service staff was excellent. They were very helpful and on time. Nice people. I asked for two bananas for breakfast and they sent up a two peeled, cut up bananas in a bowl. Like I was a toddler or something?

Now let me tell you about my first stay and the many more that followed. I am a Westie LOVER and when I first found out about a play I wanted to see on Broadway I called to make a hotel reservation and my Ritz Carlton was book solid, this was last min and completely my fault, so since Im a huge SPG fan I started looking for a place to stay with my (at the time) two Westies. I love the Union Sq. area, it's super great and there is a dog park a block away, this is a super plus for a dog freaks like myself!!!! From the time I drove up to the front door, this young man Jose came running up and took my two dogs in his arms and they loved him as well. We will get back to Jose in a minute. Seamless check in and they upgraded me to a lovely corner room with an adjoining room should we need more space. I had more luggage for my two little ones with eight stubby legged family members then for myself. Jose took us up to the fifth floor to a lovely, clean room with allot of space. While Jose was showing us around the room for things we might want to use, there was a knock at the door, is was the dog butler with beds bowls and a dinner 24 hour a day menu... I m not new to this serves, the Ritz Carlton does it as well but I NEVER expected this amazing serves from the W chain. Shame on my preconceived ideas. As I read from other reviews, I agree it's an old building that has been made into a hip, trendy, comfortable hotel with great serves. The area is only second to Central Park. This was our first stay and there were quite a few more, now the hard part to write, my Female, love of my life was having cancer issues and I knew her up coming 13th birthday would be her last, so I called the W Union Sq. and booked the same corner room for her birthday. After checking in we went right to Trixy and Peanut, a WONDERFUL up scale dog boutique, and I gave my birthday girl free run of the shop to pick all that would make her birthday perfect! Yes, I know Im crazy... She was/is a huge sex and the city fan and we found several toys that brought back the memories, I will add a photo to this review, it will show the love of my life and how the W Union Sq. went so out of their way to accommodate any and every need we wanted, learning of the reason for our stay. the night of her birthday I called down and asked if we could bring our two family members and have a few cosmos and appetizers, with out a delay they said we will reserve you the perfect spot and Jose is on tonight and if they need a walk he will do so! We went down and saw what only a world class property would do, the photo will say it all. We miss our girl every day but we have this memory, all thanks to this amazing property and their flawless staff, as hard as it will be to go back, trust me we will (we now have four Westies and I call them my gangsters 16) the number of legs that follow me EVERYWHERE!

I picked this place as it was near NYU. No regret on location--being on a major transfer point for various metro lines made a huge difference when you have meetings all over town. Easy to walk to nearby restaurants...etc. The farmer's market on Wed & Sat/Sun were also fun - one get to pick up some fresh bread, produces, diary products...etc. Lots of great retail outlets around the square too. The rooms were bigger than I thought and the hotel did a great job in decoration. Everything one needs is in the room and the bed is as heavenly as the one at the Westin's. Also appreciate the sound insulation that went into the place - having lived in NYC before, I was worried about fire trucks/ garbage trucks early in the morning and I didn't hear them at all. So well done to the W!The service is the part that needs substantial improvement. Here's why:1) My hotel key failed three times. The staff at the front desk must be trained to inform hotel guest to use the phone in the elevator lobby of their room floors when these things happen. However, such repetition of line does the hotel no help. On the first occasion, the key didn't even work in the elevator when I was in the lobby trying to go back to the room. So going back to the front desk is the easiest thing to do. Telling me to use the phone on my floor is just silly--they should have sought to understand the situation first. On the second and third time, I did use the phone on my floor, but no one picked up on the other end after 8 rings. So the hotel needs to be operationally ready before they should offer a service.2) On check out, I left my bags with the front desk for 15 mins and when I return to pick it up, I was told by the front desk staff that the doorman will help me. When I asked the doorman, his response was ""I am the doorman, I don't deal with luggage"". So I went back the second time to the front desk and it was not until then that they decided to communicate via their walkie talkies that my bags were in the closet right next to him. Meanwhile I had a car parked unattended up front on the street. What kind of service is that? There was no sense of teamwork nor customer service. Could they not have communicated as I was leaving the front desk the first time? 3) My flight arrived late and I didn't reach the hotel until 12:30am. Even though the front desk staff can clearly see that I was struggling to come through the double doors, no one offered any assistance. At all other hotels where I arrived late, there was always someone ready to offer assistance.  Having to dealing with the snobby, unhelpful and uncoordinated staff makes me question if I should come back.",Hong Kong,"cosmic_dot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",138,3.0

At check in, the woman appeared less than excited about assisting us, even though there was no one else in line. Another day, I asked the front desk where I could get coffee and a bagel outside the hotel and the response was again sort of lackluster When I am paying this much for a room, at least pretend to want to talk to me.

First impression was wonderful, the door guys outside look like bouncers in tight black T-shirts so you feel nicely protected... and they were quite frankly gorgeous. They treated me with a calm respect which was a welcome change from some of the yapping sycophants in stupid looking uniforms at the older hotels. I waited in the check-in queue for about 20 minutes before being attended to, the people behind me must have waited a lot longer. The room had a funky decor and the Wifi was consistent. It was, however, quite cold so I increased the temperature on the thermostat. Stayed in the room for a while and went to have a shower but the water was cold. Skipped it, went to get ice for my drink and the ice-machine was broken. So I went out, and when I returned later I told the front desk on the way up that the shower was cold earlier, they sent an engineer up with me who tried the tap and it was warm. Great. Showered. Room was still cold though so I turned the thermostat up again. In the morning the room was absolutely freezing, so I went to warm up in the shower which was cold again. Naked and shivering, I went to call front desk and the bedside phone was broken, completely dead. When I went out, I asked them on the way out to fix the shower and the phone. When I came back my card didn't work in the door for no apparent reason (it wasn't the last day) so I had to traipse back down with shopping to get it re-done. The shower was then warm and there was a brand new phone by the bed but the room was still freezing. I called and said my heater is broken. Response? ""There's no heating after May 15"". Although the thermostat now said 80 Fahrenheit, it had still been cooling my room with air conditioning. New Yorkers might be comfortable in 60 degrees but I live in Dubai was aiming for at least 73 inside. I would have appreciated being warned (perhaps a little sign near the thermostat) not to literally make myself sick by trying to warm up the room. After an argument they did send up a heater for me but unfortunately by then I'd already caught a cold. When I checked out and nasally told front desk that my stay was not enjoyable, listing the problems I'd experienced (there was another one with the telly), the ""lady"" basically implied it was my fault for not reporting each problem as and when it arose, then repeating the complaint when it arises again. This annoyed me because I had informed then, but I also believe it is the responsibility of the hotel to ensure that their rooms are functioning, the water is hot, the phone working etc. and not of the person paying in excess of $500 per night to take care of maintenance or guess that a thermostat saying 80 means ""COLDER PLEASE"". She said a manager would call me but I haven't heard anything. I appreciate I was unlucky on this trip and most people should have a good experience but I have to review based on what happened. Oh, great location near Union Square and subways.

There are certain things you know you should expect at each W you visit. W always delivers. I had never stayed at the Union Square location before, but ended up booking myself and some work colleagues there this month for a one night stay. It was a good choice.The rooms were a good size, by New York standards and featured lots of light and high ceilings. My bathroom had a window and was filled with sunlight when I checked in. (My room was on a high floor facing east.)I'm not sure about the leather, metal and animal print decor though -- not my taste, and not what W typically offers, but how can anyone not love the bed at a W?This was perhaps not the best choice for business as the lobby kind of turns into a club after happy hour at the bar is over-- although it worked for our team. (That said, if you wanted to have a quiet place for an evening meeting with a colleague after sales calls, you'd be out of luck.)I would likely stay here again on future trips, but not if I was travelling with work colleagues as the W is not for everyone.BTW, the breakfast at Olives was very, very good.

We've stayed in a variety of rooms, and one time where I slipped someone $60 when checking in, got a great upgrade. Recently though when we checked in, we hated the room. It felt empty for the larger size we got, and the decor was very cold - faded blue and orange on white, with no art on the walls. When we asked if we could be moved to a room with the ""new decor"" - what we remembered to be plush beige and purple velvets, they said the blue and orange was brand new across the hotel. Yuck! I'm sure they tested and researched it, but it's definately not to our taste. And they have a new policy with the sheets which is to have a built-in moisture barrier (like sheets for toddlers who wet the bed) as part of the mattress pad. My husband was fine with it, but I woke up in a sweat every night because the bed didn't breathe or wick. When I called down they said it was on all the beds and that my only option was to take off the mattress pad (I should have). One problem we generally have with this hotel (which was likely rehabbed from a very old building) is that there is a small air vent near the window. It gets about 50% covered by the curtain (which originates next to it and can't be moved aside to expose the whole vent. So the rooms are generally stuffy and uneven temps. Seems like an easy enough fix to at least allow the vent to not be covered by the curtain. Overall the staff is always very nice and helpful. Be aware that if you buy coffee in the restaurant, they charge $4 per cup, no free refills.

Main entrance was under construction so one entered on 41st St. W Union Square was nice, but room not as much light as the other two and also didn't have as good views although it was in a great location. the W was normally more expensive, but I had a discount local rate through work.

After 15 minutes or so talking to the staff on the elevator phone, they got it going, thank God.

I regret to say that I doubt I'll be staying in a W again, especially given I'm a consultant who spends lots of time in hotels and am a Starwood Hotels fan. I paid my own money for two rooms to stay in a W on this special occasion in NYC; it definitely wasn't worth it.I booked in October/early November for a trip in late January 2012. I was staying for two special occasions, my 30th birthday and my mother's 60th birthday. I requested 2 king size bedrooms on the same floor. Here are some observations and reflections from our stay (Jan 25 - Jan 31 2012):1. When we arrived they tried to put us in a double rooms with no compensation2. Made no reference to my request for two rooms on the same floor - when i brought it up they said a large party decided to extend last minute and couldn't honour it, they told me to try the following day, when i went back the following day they said not to bother as there was construction and we'd be bothered by the noise. Again no apologies that they couldn't do anything to help us3. Two friends sent cards to the hotel with our names and the dates of our stays on them scheduled to arrive for the start of the stay, we were not advised of any cards or mail arriving at the hotel for our attention. Given two friends sent cards, I believe the hotel let us down, rather than the US Postal Service but obviously impossible to know for sure4. The room keys were deactivated every time you put them in the lift to access the room floors. We had to keep one for the lift and the other for the room which meant we each needed to carry around 2 keys! We had to have our room keys reset several times, I mentioned something to the hotel; they sent someone up to reset our room lock, but this was to no avail. They did remove some charges from our room which was nice and appreciated. 5. On checkout on Jan 31st the woman serving us was unpleasant, inaccurate and rude when we enquired if our credit card had been charged for the additional items on the rooms. Not the service I expect from a W hotel. 6. The overall standard of the hotel rooms has declined, the bathroom was looking tired with brown mould in the shower. There was a champagne cork on the floor in the room when we arrived indicating the level of cleaning could use improvement, and our rooms were inconstantly refreshed with toiletries and bathrobes during our stay. 7. I wrote a feedback note at the hotel when we left, no one has contacted me regarding my stay.

What went wrong? 1. No apparent upgrade for my SPG Platinum status, though I was informed on checkin that as a Plat, my ""internet was free"" and I'd receive ""500 Plat Amenity points""...that's the minimum requirement, it's not as if I was being done some sort of favor 2. Doorman busy texting instead of doing his job. 3. Room assignment next to the elevator (#809), thus I was treated to loud guests outside my door until well into the wee hours 4. 8-inch long rust stain in the bathtub, disgusting that housekeeping is apparently so oblivious to maintaining a high standard that it was allowed to be there for a long period of time. I wonder how many weeks or months that stain has been there? How many other guests complained, and nothing was done about it? 5. Breakfast the next morning in Olives, and the waiter served jams with the bread basket...and one of the jams was opened, half-used by a previous guest, and obviously no one in the restaurant bothered to check when they cleared the table from the day before. 6. The hotel overall is in an old building, and the overall appearance is drab, and fairly shouting that a renovation is in order. 7. And I know low lighting is the ""style"" of W hotels, but at least make the bulbs work on the elevator room numbers. The elevators don't have the same matching numbers array, (i.e., the 1st floor number isn't in the exact same place on the panel in each elevator), and so it forced me each time to have to crouch down to see ""1"" clearly enough to push the button. 8. An indifferent staff attitude from top to bottom towards me as a customer. This may be ""New York"" style attitudes, but it doesn't excuse a lack of customer service. Oddly, the only other hotel I've ever experienced within SPG that exhibits this kind of staff indifference to the customer is the Westin Paris. I was told that it was just the ""Parisian Way"". Whether it's the New York Way, or the Parisian Way, bad customer service doesn't get a free pass from me. I also experienced a great deal of difficulty sending my complaints after the stay to the hotel general manager. The Starwood email giving me his address and asking for my feedback was no use, email sent to the address they gave me bounced back as ""undeliverable"". Eventually, customer service people contacted me, and while they said all the right words, the only way I'll ever know if their words are sincere and meaningful, and if this hotel is any better than my dreadful experience, is if I return to it again. I'm not sure I have enough courage to want to experience this nonsense again.","Burlington, Vermont","signothetimes53</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Burlington, Vermont</strong>",55,1.0

We arrived in New York, my partner, my sister, my brother in law and I after a long flight from Australia and it was approximately 7am. We were tired and the jet lag had really set in, so we thought we'd try the hotel to see if we could get an early check in. The lady at the desk was amazing, she said the cleaners were getting in at 8:30 and she would make sure they do the rooms straight away and allow us in. By about 9:30 the first room was ready so we sent my sister and her husbane up and my partner and I waited. The lady said half an hour but because it took about an hour she was so apologetic and upgraded our room to the 18th floor. WE were the ones that turned up too early yet SHE went out of her way to help us and make us happy. The doormen were the next people I noticed in terms of service. They were amazing. So polite, always willing to give directions, always making sure a taxi is ready so we're not waiting in the cold. Absolutely wonderful. Please tip these guys when you're there because they truly deserve it! Whatever/Whenever (concierge) was again, amazing. From booking tours to giving advice on where to celebrate new years eve. They recommended a restaurant right near times square where we enjoyed an 8 course meal and were then lucky enough to see the ball drop right in the heart of times square. A memory never to be forgotten. The rooms... Beautiful. We were lucky enough to have a room that looked over the park and it was truly beautiful to wake up to every morning. The rooms were always immaculate and everything was always kept well stocked. The bed was really comfy along with the pillows. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. For my first time in New York, it really made me love the experience so much more.

There was not one staff member who wasn't friendly and obliging. We had 2 stays - the first for 10 nights and the second for 9 nights with a four day side trip out of town in between. On our return we were spoilt with a surprise delivery of cakes to our room - which were stunning, and an invitation for a complimentary breakfast - totally unexpected but a fabulous gesture. Both times we had excellent rooms which were quite large compared to other places I have stayed in New York, with 2 double beds, a bath and a great view over Union Square - rooms 1502 & 1602. My only criticism is that the lighting is insufficient. It would be great if any future refurbishment includes reading lamps over the beds. We experienced room service, breakfast at ""Olives"" and drinks in the bar area. The room service meals came within the specified time and were very good. Breakfast was excellent and good value with large servings. The drinks in the bar area off the foyer were fine but expect it to be noisy as it seems to be a popular meeting place for locals. The position of the W at Union Square was excellent - there is a huge Barnes and Noble book store nearby as well as Starbucks, Macdonalds, Wholefoods, vegetarian take-away and fabulous restuarants and cafes such as Grammercy Tavern, Rohm (Thai), Union Square Cafe and La Pizza Fresca Ristorante in East 20th Street for wood fired pizzas. The subway is very close and taxis were always available out front. There is a Greenmarket held in the Square a few times a week where organic breads, fruit, cheese and farmer-direct produce can be purchased. Throughout our entire stay the Union Square Christmas Market was held daily with a fabulous selection of interesting stores and gourmet food. Two doors away from the hotel there is a 24 hour ""Pharmacy"" that stocks most food and personal items you would need. The room had a mini-bar but no tea and coffee facilities but each morning coffee was offered free in the foyer. My two adolescent girls loved the hotel and its position - close to East Village and Soho. When I travel to New York again I will definitely stay at this hotel.

It's location on Union Square puts it right between the village and midtown....TWO blocks from the Union Square subway stations that can whisk you anywhere in the city via express trains....even crosstown. Times square is a 10 minute subway ride from here.....This location is FLAWLESS. Lots of local restuarants and you are not stuck in a prime ""tourist"" area where you are eating with the people at 55 other hotels that they are catering to. From here you can walk to over 50+restaurants in a 10 minute radius many of which are well priced and Very Very good. This hotel's location really would get my vote for best location in NYC. Staff are friendly and remember you when you return. It is a converted bank building from the early 1900's so many of the rooms have strange shapes and high ceilings with big window and lots of light. I have only ever booked the park view rooms and they are spectacular viewing over union square park and now onto the in construction ""freedom towers"" being build about 1 mile south from here. The beds are uber comfortable and the lounge bar in the front is a lovely place to read a book and have some tea. Minibar prices are insane so I always go out and one block south to the 1) Liquor store and 2) deli for bottles of water. The bathrooms are clean and white and we always enjoy the bliss bath products. Sometimes we have had to wait for our room however this trip was a breeze and no waiting....Great. If you want a hotel that puts you smack in the middle of one of most of the fun vibrant areas of NYC this hotel is it. I know they are planning renovations this year as the rooms are a bit tired, however I am not sure when this will begin.

On Saturday night, the front desk was unstaffed and the woman at the concierge casually informed me that I would have to wait for them to come back up. When I asked if she would call because we had been waiting for ten minutes, she told me ""they saw it on the security cameras and would come up when they could."" Also, despite being in the hotel for five days, the hotel couldn't figure out a way to make my keys work every single time...I ended up just getting a new key every time I finished to avoid the hassle. Last night, I asked to place an order for room service and Whatever Whenever told me that they couldn't take my order because room service was ""out."" I called back and India said she couldn't help me and that they would call me when they were ready.

I am not young or hip; I favor khakis and button down shirts, subways over stretch limos and a tuna fish sandwich over tuna tartar. No one put a gun to my head and made me stay at The W on Union Square, but for the price paid, $429 a night, it came up short.Negatives, and some are nitpicky, but I think when you shell out a grand for two nights in a 221 square foot room you have the right to be nitpicky: no upholstered side chair in Room 616, as pictured on the hotel’s website for their entry level class of room, the “Wonderful Room.” There was a suitable desk chair, but that was it. … the desk clerk struggled with English and had a dickens of a time communicating with me in order to locate my reservation even though I handed her a piece of paper with my confirmation number and name. … my first two keycards did not work in the elevator. … there is no ramp from the street entrance to the front desk, just stairs, which means rolling luggage is of little benefit. … the really neat looking radio in my room did not work and when I called for assistance no one could explain to me how it worked. … the water control in the shower would not permit a strong flow of moderately hot water: the choice was excellent pressure of scalding hot water, or a trickle of enjoyably hot water. … the mattress pad was a couple of inches too short, head and foot, for the bed, which was not conducive for a good night’s sleep. … plenty of lamps, but lighting was too dim at night for work. … view from my window was into a generally grim back interior of the hotel.Positives: housekeeping was polite, accommodating and worked around my schedule. … I felt safe on the property. … room service breakfast was delivered on time. … well renovated, repurposed 100-year old building, with significant architectural integrity preserved.Would I have voiced these complaints had I paid $275-to-$325 a night, which is pretty standard in Manhattan for a comfortable, well-located room? Probably not, but I do think I paid too much in relation to what I received, and value is important to me. In fact, it is the single most important factor in selecting a place to spend my money, or when recommending to others where they spend theirs.","raleigh, nc","on-the-cheap</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>raleigh, nc</strong>",26,3.0

Minuses: - the office buidling next door har direct view into our bathroom, so the curtains had to be closed all the time - sloppy service: No turn down service on day two, same goes for newspaper. Found some garbage under the sink at the bathroom floor. - only the window in the bedroom area seemed to soundproof (we had a suite). - air con pretty noisey (looked old) - some attitude from staff (the W syndrome), e.g.: at check in, we asked if the room was in a quiet location. Answer: ""Its New York, nothing is quiet here."" Had to clearify that we of course knew that and that the question was if there was anything available on a higher floor (we got 11 out of 22) or if any of the sides were more quiet than the others. - errors in the bill, but those were correct upon check out. Neutral: - bar/restaurant is very popular and lively. Great choice for a pre- or post-dinner drink. However, the sound level does probably mean that the lower hotel floors should be avoided.All in all, pretty expensive for what you get.

Proximity to Union Square subway station allows you to travel quickly all over the city. MUCH more fun, more ""authentic"" and less overwhelming than midtown and certainly better than Times Square. Rooms aren't huge and bathrooms could stand an update - but when you are visiting New York I imagine you are rarely in your room! Try to get a room with a view of Union Square. Thought the service was terrific. It's located in a really great neighborhood. Don't miss checking out Gramercy Park, the Union Square farmers' market, Irving Place (try Friend of a Farmer for brunch or Casa Mono for dinner), ABC Home (and the restaurants in it!). I am not crazy about Todd English's Olives in the hotel but others love it. Great place to stay - especially if you can swing it on SPG points!

I was staying in a MEGA king room.....really? We had a rollaway in the room which we had to pay extra for, its was so bad that you would feel the springs digging into your skin. When I went to the front desk about it they said they would send up a few extra blankets (thin, very thin). Didn't help at all. The staff seems to have an attitude like you are bothering them instead of the normal welcoming one you would expect. I did email the manager after our stay and they did reimburse us for the rollaway. Won't stay there again.","roswell, ga","cmdadamo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>roswell, ga</strong>",1,3.0

Firstly I’ll point out i did use (many many) AA miles to book the room which might explain why ours was more like a dark cave than a 5* hotel room - 2 tall windows looking out at a brick wall with another building next door - i had to stand by the window and look directly up to even see a tiny patch of sky. The room was certainly large for NY, but would have preferred less space and a teeny tiny view/daylight. There was only one of the doormen who ever held the door open and no-one offered to help us with our bags to our room when we arrived. Additionally, I thought that the communal areas lacked space and wow factor. There were no seats in the lobby and never any free seats in the small bar and the lobby bathrooms were dated and utilitarian. We have stayed in the Crosby St & Soho Grand and much preferred both for ambiance.To be fair, if you had a room with daylight and used the hotel staff a lot (who, it is said, are very helpful), perhaps you would have a very different view. But I am a low maintenance guest who likes lobby space & design in a hotel, so I guess Union Sq W just isn’t for me.","London, United Kingdom","Cerrig</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",5,3.0

The bathroom was a bit narrow but since it was clean i again overlooked the size, the only complaint i had about the bathroom is the dial on the shower was broken and the hotel's idea of a quick fix was using a bandage like tape that no longer served its purpose...with that said i found myself turning the dial all through out my shower.

Both properties couldn’t be more different in terms of style and setup, and both have their pros and cons, but I found this to be the better one. The location, on the edge of SoHo makes for a much more interesting holiday location than midtown. Subway station just outside the hotel, and many great restaurants within easy walking distance.First impressions were slightly poor – no one at the door to help with our bags/open the heavy doors. This was a recurring theme of our stay (more on this later). Reception staff however were very ncie and although an early check-in was not possible, we were given a great upgrade thanks to SPG Platinum status. The corner room was really spacious and at least twice as big as the one we had in the W Midtown. Noise from outside wasn't an issue at all. The furnishings were also much classier and made for an altogether more relaxing experience. Bed was very comfy and the bathroom was enormous andhad a classy-classic décor to it.Concierge had very good tips for restaurants, much appreciated. Breakfast at the restaurant was a bit unremarkable so we weren’t enticed to try other meals.Main complaint with this place involved door staff and Acura service. Contrary to most other W hotels, there isn’t a dedicated Acura desk to book the rides, it needs to be arranged directly with the driver and there are no pre-bookings. This led to a funny situation, where we were haggling with the doormen, who seemed to act like “agents” of the driver. A request for a 10-block ride to Soho at 2:00PM was met with loads of excuses about traffic, and a none too subtle reminder that although the ride was free, we needed to tip the driver generously! Other cases of less than optimal behaviour by door staff involved them watching us struggling to open the doors with bags of shopping and simply staring, or simply not being anywhere near the door most of the time. Management, please give these people correct training, and include a dedicated person to pre-book the Acura rides.","Rio de Janeiro, RJ","rafkam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro, RJ</strong>",642,4.0

The room was very average and poorly laid out, but maybe just a bit more spacious than the typical NYC hotel room? Either way, it seemed pretty shabby for a W. The air conditioner made an annoying whirring sound, the lighting was bad (the desk lamp didn’t even work), the shower could’ve used a good thorough scrubbing (though the shower pressure itself was great), the closet door got stuck on the room door (hard to explain) and so on. Just a lot of little things that weren’t so obtrusive that we needed a new room, but things that you shouldn’t have to deal with when you’re spending this much $ on a room. The bed was the main saving grace—incredibly comfortable. Oh, and the Bliss products!My biggest peeve—the pesky wifi fee… Why some hotels charge for this still is beyond me. We thought since my husband is an SPG member, it was complimentary. Nope. That’s only for their top-tier members apparently. Ridiculous.The service was rather lackluster. Aside from the doorman issue, the people at the front desk weren’t the most helpful. Our first day there, my room key wouldn’t work in the elevator. The woman at the front desk checked it and told me it should be working, then agreed to give me a new key. The room was in my husband’s name so she couldn’t give me a new key without talking to him first—despite the fact that I already had a key to the room to begin with, and despite the fact that I showed her my ID which had the same last name as the one on the reservation.The location is great but unfortunately the hotel is not. It really doesn't live up to the standard one would expect from W Hotels.","Chicago, Illinois","beantown_illini</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",56,3.0

This is purely because of the location of the hotel. However, we have had a bad experience in a well-known hotel in NYC - where the room was old and the shower head fell off. We decided to go with the Union Square W Hotel after all because it was Newer than many NYC hotels in the Starwood chain. We were pleasantly surprised. Check in and Reception staff were very polite and helpful. The doormen were very helpful - they knew the area well. We had good recommendations on where to go for breakfast each morning. We particularly liked square across from the hotel - there are shops and cafes, and Wholefoods as well. Walk a couple of blocks up and you can see Barnes and Noble as well as H&M, as well as other well known brands. Soho is a short taxi ride away. We travelled to mid-town quite a lot (to get to Times Square and all the other sights) and spend an average of $12 on cab-fare per ride. The subway station is located in Union Square and this is a very convenient and inexpensive transportation alternative to taxis. We couldn't take the subway because of my elderly mum. As family travellers, we were pleasantly surprised that the hotel is located in such pleasant surroundings. It is quiet in the mornings (NYC standards), It does however, gets busy in the ground floor lounges in the evenings. This does not bother us as the rooms are well-insulated and we don't hear anything once we shut the room door. If you do plan to stay, ask for the larger rooms on the upper floors that face the Square. It's very roomy, has large windows that let in lots of light and you get to see the activity of Union Square below.",Perth Australia,"jogoony</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth Australia</strong>",35,5.0

(to be honest this Hilton is a better choice for us since our NYC offices are located in the World Financial Center Just across ground zero building site)As soon as he checked, direction Concierge to book a table at the strip house for 3, my boss had called to ask what were the plan for the night (very good steak and usual poor/amateurish service you can expect in NYC, strangely enough only in Restaurant).For me and my colleague as 2 French persons (our boss is English) the most important part of the day was done (securing food) we headed for the UNDERBAR, so we passed near the Fitness room (not very attractive, but I am not a sport person) which looks very attractive base on some reviews for our first G&T, this was a disappointment, dark and gloomy, mainly looked like the interior of a bunker (and we were nearly the only ones).No problem then up to the bar in the lobby, where we were supposed to meet our boss (and our 2nd G&T) the place is heaving looks so trendy, really a place to see (and be seen ?, will leave this one to NYC residents) after a third G&T... (no we stopped at 2, we were having dinner with our boss, you may have a look at Strip House New York for more info -but still not written-) we headed for dinner (we had the 3rd one back in the hotel).the location is great, Tube/Subway? is just round the corner and as soon as you understand how it works you can be anywhere in Manhattan within minutes. and if you want something special you can get have a look at the Union Square Farmer's Market (Mon,Wed,Fri,Sat looked at internet to give accurate information) the market is across the street and provide quite a choice of food from the New-England and Canada as well as American natives art)Very good as well for the one, who do not like restaurant on their own, there is a Whole Food across the square (for the non US reader, Whole Food is a grocery/supermarket providing normal vegetable, take away foods AND a dining area and microwave after the tills. My favourite choice on a city tour.Checkout was very efficient and it was time for fly back to Germany for a week before visiting the Waldorf Astoria. Final judgement:I will definitely recommend the place, (without GF, except if she looks like a top model, since a lot of girls in the lobby bar do look like it)localisation is perfect.only issue was the price, got a lot of more enjoyable stays at at other (Starwood) properties in NYC/NJ, However this place may be attractive for me but not other people (W Hoboken, stay tuned)","Frankfurt, Germany","Bertrand B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Frankfurt, Germany</strong>",2,5.0

The location is great of the Union Square W it is in the middle of great shopping and very close to the Subway. That was my favorite part of this hotel. The rooms are larger than the W New York, but I found them to not be as well 'styled'. Also, the building is very old... and one big problem is you can hear a lot between the walls. The other issue I had with this W is that the service is not up to par with other W's I have stayed at. The front desk manager was excellent. Front desk and doormen/bell staff was just 'OK'. Upon check-in I requested a roll-a-way bed and never got it. I had to call again hours later to ask again. Also, the doormen/bell staff are not as friendly/eager to assist with getting you a taxi or taking your luggage. The yes I would recommend is a 'barely' recommend.

I am a very frequent traveler and a Starwood hotel lover with SPG elite status. Chris Thomas and Nelson at the front desk were outstanding in ensuring that I got the room I needed. The hotel was booked solid and the room I'd requested was not available at first. Chris went out of his way and more than made up for this issue. He really took care of us and proved that some hotels know how to value relationships over transactions. This was, bar none, the finest customer service I've seen at a Starwood hotel. They instantly turned a potentially negative experience into a uniquely positive one. (I also ended up in the room I'd requested!)Location: If you're a young solo traveler or a young couple, you'd do well to avoid Midtown. It's best to avoid the crush of tourists around Rockefeller Center and Times Square. This hotel is perfectly situated at the crossroads of Midtown and Downtown and a block away from a major subway hub. Unless you want a standard New York tourist experience, you'll probably find yourself going out to restaurants and bars in the Village/Soho/Lower East Side area. You could stay in those neighborhoods, but that puts you much farther from the daytime activities like the Met, Fifth Avenue shopping, and Central Park. Everything is within striking distance from this hotel.Rooms: When it comes to room quality, it's all relative in New York. You can't expect a Texas-sized room (or bathtub) just off Union Square. But W delivers with above-average rooms for this city. Bathrooms could benefit from a Westin-style upgrade. Amenities: For a Category 6 Starwood hotel, I'd expect to get more than a basement gym and a hip lobby scene. If there was an Aloft hotel next door, it would have the same amenities, and they'd probably rate it as Category 4. There is no spa, no pool (that I could find), and a gym with a little more equipment than your average Holiday Inn Express. Overall, I would definitely stay here again. You don't go to New York to hang out in a hotel room, after all, and the things that really matter in that city -- a comfortable bed, enough room to move around, and welcoming staff -- were there in spades.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","livetwice</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",14,5.0

Close to the subway and fun shops and restaurants it’s also away from the crazy overpopulation of Times Square. The hotel itself is very typical W which appeals to many, but not to all. There is a great energy and Vibe about the place without being too pretentious which some W properties fall prey to.The rooms are decent sizes by New York standards and some are quite large. Ask for corner rooms on upper floors. My one gripe - - the rooms are getting tired looking. I’ve been staying at this hotel for years and the décor and finishes were cool 10 years ago but are looking a bit dark and dreary now. The bed and bedding is great – a hallmark of W Hotels. The bathroom is cramped and dated and for some reason the water temperature was impossible to regulate on this past stay…either frigid or scalding.There are better boutique hotels if that’s what you are looking for. I stay here because I’m loyal to Starwood and like to earn the points. If you are traveling with people who prefer more traditional environs (i.e. no loud music in lobby, no busy bar scene) you might want to consider other options like the Le Meridien or the new Intercontinental. All that said - - I will be back as I really do like the hotel and the location…just hope a decorator stops by soon.","Chicago, Illinois","Pete312</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",34,4.0

Hotel is a narrow building, so the lobby is unimpressive, elevators tiny and dark. 'Living room' on the side is cold in the winter, but there is free wifi down there.

What kind of four - five star hotel doesn't have a door man opening the door all the time during business hours??Had a room w 2DB, which was spacious I thought, esp for NY standards. But beds were a bit soft and could use new mattresses. Cleanliness/maintenance OK, but not spic and span. Soot by the windows and stains here and there, some rusting in the tub area.

Both were great. The W Union Square was in a great location. It had a nice lobby and bar and was relatively clean. They let us check in early to one of our two rooms. The concierge was wonderful. We could barely hear any other guests and our room was on the back side and you'd never guess we were on Park Ave. BUT...front desk staff were hurried and unfriendly (I am a native northeasterner so I am used to east-coast attitudes) - not up to the expectation I'd have for a W. I wasn't asked if I had a starwood number, which I did, even though I didn't put it on the reservation. They just, always ask - but not this time since they were in such a hurry (no one else was waiting). The room we stayed in was a good size, with a great bathroom, but the hallway and room had the lingering odor of smoke covered up by air freshener. Our friends were never notified when their room was available, as promised;their room didn't smell, but they could hear the Park Ave noise. The hall rugs were stained from what looked like some water damage. The bill for the room across the hall was slid under our door. The final letdown was that the turndown staff stole my powder makeup (really? makeup?). And when I told the front desk person, I got the same hurried, mumbled, robot-like response ('my apologies for the inconvenience'...that's about it.).I also just found out that the hotel filed for bankruptcy in May. So I would guess that the prospect of any improvements is low and that the hotel will slowly keep going downhill unless starwood intervenes.

(you may want to read my review about it).The W Union Square is nicely located in the city. A 10 minute taxi-ride or subway-ride will take you to Times Square. The hotel is in a 100 year old landmark buidling that's nice, clean and quiet. The staff are amazing. Check in was a breeze with the phenomenal Tamara who went out of her way to make us feel welcome. We stayed at a mega room, which was OK for size, not as big or luxurious as you would expect for almost $500 per night. Nothing bad here, but we sort of expected the room and the hotel in general to be as amazing as the one in Fort Lauderdale, which wasn't the case unfortunately. I'm told that hotels in NYC have smaller rooms anyway. As I said, we didn't have any specific complaints about the hotel but we were not ""wow'ed"" !!So basically, it's a nice clean hotel that meets the standards of the industry but no extras here. No spa, pool, or large lobby to relax at. In other words, there's very little luxury but all the basic needs are met. Again, for the price you pay, you'd expect more than the basics.

The bellman also welcomed me back by name. When I checked into the hotel they welcomed me back and wished me a happy birthday. In all my stays I can only think of two properties I have been at that they know me on sight by name. Both of which I have stayed at for years and they did not know me after one stay! Throughout the day as I came and left (I was working) everyone I came in contact with passed by on my way to the elevators called me by name and wished me a happy birthday. This evening I heard a knock at my door and I was about to turn in. I went to the door it was the manager with champagne, strawberries dipped in chocolate and 2 Magnolia cupcakes! For those of you who do not know Magnolia you have not lived! They were featured in Sex and the City (Series). This was quite unexpected and WONDERFUL! Albeit I have platinum status with Starwood but I can honestly say they really go the extra mile! They treat you like you are their only guest! ***** WELL WORTH STAYING!!!! Food is excellent, service impeccable, rooms beautiful, beds comfortable, view amazing, weekends feature farmers market within walking distance, near subways, cabs, centrally located, state of the art gym, SECURE key access to floors (a must for NYC), walking distance to restaurants, and shopping.","Miami, Florida","Montelle K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",80,5.0

My assessment is based on many stays at this hotel and extensive experience with other fine hotels in New York, in major cities around the United Stastes, and in other parts of the world. The physical reasons are plentiful: excellent location with easy access uptown or downtown -- a neighborhood with some of the city's greatest restaurants a short walk away (Gramercy Tavern, Blue Water Grill, Gotham Bar & Grill, Union Square Cafe, Veritas, and literally hundreds of the best are nearby). Business entertaining is thus easy and pleasant, and could include the hotel's Olives Restaurant, run by celebrity chef Todd English, where I often hold business breakfasts.The rooms are spacious, with great beds, great showers/bathrooms, and an outstanding work area with high-speed internet access. The very good rasio alarms also have Ipod docking stations. I get tons of work done very productively there. Across the street, Union Square always is bustling, and on at least three days a week it boasts the finest farmer's market in the city. What a treat! After visiting the terrific restaurants, sushi bars, seafood houses, barbeque joint, and green market within a two-block radius, the W allows you to work off the calories in a superb fitness center stocked with first-rate equipment. The rooms are cleaned and stiocked masterfully by the excellenrt ""room stylists,"" who always address even the most minor special request (e.g., extra linens or such). But those are just physical attributes. As with human beings, the true beauty of a fine hotel goes way beyond physical beauty. The spirit that sets this place apart comes from an extraordinary team of people, and their passion for true hospitality. I've always been delighted by the service at W hotels (have stayed very often at the one in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and elsewhere, including the superb Court and Tuscany hotels on E. 39th St.). At the W Union Square, it's the W spitrit on steroids. The good feeling starts with the best front door team (known as welcome ambassadors), to an amazing front desk team, to extremely helpful concierges, and to great customer relations specialists and managers. I know many of them by name and would like to mention them here, but I am afraid to omit anyone. They consitently come through for me every time a stay there, and they make me feel like family -- on every visit, at least a couple of the guys at the door ask for my wife, who they've met; it means so much to me that they also make her feel at home when she comes. The W Union Square gets my strongest recommendation, as many of my friends and colleagues know. I'm a huge fan.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","fordpat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",3,5.0

The suite was amazing with a lovely bathroom with huge window and tub and shower. Free wifi in the lounge, and the ability to check in online and print off our boarding passes, plus an excellent concierge service are all those little extras that add up to a great stay.","Bath, United Kingdom","MrsP18</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bath, United Kingdom</strong>",13,5.0
