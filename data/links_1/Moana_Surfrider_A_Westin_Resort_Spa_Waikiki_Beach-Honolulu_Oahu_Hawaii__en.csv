In the booking of our room some 9 months before this our first ever trip to Hawaii, a request was made for a corner room in the historic Banyan Wing. Knowing this was “the” original hotel admittedly carried a certain attractive allure. Yes, upon arrival from the airport, the entryway was crazy busy with guests, valets, bellmen, and street-walking passersby swarming about the hotel entrance. There was equal chaos leading to the check-in desk as we maneuvered our own luggage around hotel employees and other guests—with no one offering assistance. The stone-faced front desk clerk that eventually waved us forward seemed inordinately brusque—perhaps it was the end of her shift and ready to head home. Speaking very hurriedly with an obviously tired memorized greeting, she seemed annoyed by our request for clarification of one of the points she made—promptly pushing a mass produced handout toward us along with our keycard, indicating “this would answer all our questions” before briskly turning away from us to signal that was the end of our encounter. Stumbling toward an elevator, once again dragging our bags behind, we were lucky that this lift carried us to our assigned floor—crossing our fingers the entire way that our room would be acceptable. Opening the door, indeed a corner room as we had requested greeted us with a lovely beachside view draped by the landmark banyan tree. While the room was smaller than we typically are accustomed in Texas, it was certainly adequate particularly since there was room to open our luggage and still navigate the room without tripping. The flower-themed colors & decor did provide a certain Old World Hawaiian charm to the room!The double bed was comfortable and the room clean although definitely of “vintage construction”. Our bathroom was relatively small but bearably ample for our modest needs. While it quickly fogged up while taking a shower, our sleeping quarters did not seem to be particularly muggy or humid in comparison. There was a beach party outside on our first night, spirited by throbbing music with heavy bass lasting past midnight; however, with ear plugs and travel weary bodies we finally drifted off to sleep. Upon awakening the next morning as the morning sun peaked through the window shutters, my wife turned and asked me what did I think about Hawaii and the Moana Surfrider so far? My reply was simply: “This ain’t Texas!”","Benbrook, Texas","Texman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Benbrook, Texas</strong>",323,3.0

I’m a bonvoy Marriott platinum member and I received an ocean view upgrade and had access to the lounge every day. The location is great. It’s right on the beach and there are a ton of restaurants and stores within walking distance. If you get hot on the beach and don’t feel like going in the ocean the pool is right there. At night after a nice dinner come back to the hotel and sit on the rocking chairs on either the front or back porch for a relaxing time. The room was a decent size and the bathroom had your standard tub/shower combo. Also the toilet seats were heated which was different. The gym was very nice for being a hotel gym. Had plenty of equipment and was a decent size. There is a $37 per day resort fee which sucks but it does come with some amenities that I didn’t really look into. The parking is also very expensive so I recommend parking at the banyan condominiums where parking is only $80 for the week. The staff were all very friendly. They were willing to help with bags and greeted me and my fiancée with Hawaiian leis which I didn’t think they did anymore but they do. I had an issue with the delivery of a specialty proposal cake (they lost my order) but the man I talked to on the phone was very apologetic and took care of the issue right away.

She also gave us a voucher for free pineapple soft serve! I never had pineapple soft serve before,and it was delicious! Thank you!She also got us room upgrade with amazing Waikiki beach view to wish my happy birthday (it was my birthday trip), and the view was unreal. The hotel have the old building, which is the original, and a new building. We got the old building, which seemed out dated, and room was small with no patio, but I was aware of that it is the 'first lady' hotel with history. The location can't be any better if you want to experience the Waikiki beach. It's right at the center of the beach, and it's only few steps from your room. The provide beach towels (they charge for the resort fee, and it's part of the service I believe. Totally worth it!) So you can be at the beach day and night. We actually went out few times a day to enjoy the beach. We also had breakfast there, and it was fantastic. Everything was fresh, and staff was so friendly. The beach bar at night was great too. Live music and the ocean wave sound, great good and service. The banyan tree in the center is beautiful to look. We really enjoyed the time at this hotel, and I highly recommend!

My husband has platinum elite status with bonvoy so we were able to access the lounge which was open form breakfast and wine and appetizers in the evening and you could pop in for snacks and drinks during the day. It was good to have a place to take the kids when they needed a snack. Most people have noted the pool was small but it suited our needs and the beach access was invaluable with little kids. We actually managed to pick up some pool floats for the kids from the pool attendants who said that people leave them behind all the time and they are always throwing them out, another group gave us sand toys and a boogie board which we later passed to another group with kids at the end. We were upgraded to the top floor and had a partial ocean view. The room was spacious and quiet and we were able to put the 1 year old in the bathroom. There were lots of tours that could be arranged within the hotel but we decided to just enjoy the beach and took the kids to the aquarium which we could walk to from the hotel.

Although the hotel is wonderfully situated and highly convenient in Waikiki from the moment we arrived everything was a little off - our check in staff were not great - we had a room in The Tower side of the hotel and the elevators here were never monitored to the extent that we caught a homeless man in the elevator one night and when we told the hotel they said security was very busy elsewhere! Our room smelled terribly when we arrived thankfully I had a candle and had to have housekeeping come and re-clean the room. Housekeeping was an ongoing issue and we had to ask several times for the room to be cleaned and to get turn down service they kept blaming the do not disturb sign which we hung on the door once.The beach bar is great and the position on the beach lovely, but crowded and busy and many screaming children. We ate in the dining room one night and the food was average and overpriced and there was an issue with the billing - still being resolved. Our saving grace was Shawn the concierge who was amazing and helpful and always super positive and helped us with several reservations.

In fact it is the first hotel ever bill in Hawaii completed in 1901. Back then it opened with 75 rooms and it was $1.50 a night to stay there. Today there have been additions to the original structure but it is still a beautiful hotel referred to as Waikiki‘s first lady. For years and years it was a Starwood property and then Marriott Bonvoy bought Starwood. I was a big fan of Starwood not so much of a fan of Bonvoy. In fact I don’t like Bonvoy at all, even though I have almost 700 stays with what is now Marriott Bonvoy Marriott and roughly 300 at the Moana Surfrider itself. The first time I ever went to the Moana Surfrider was in 1975 when my parents took me. If you like to go to the beach @ Waikiki this is the best property to do so. It has a pool but it’s a small pool and there’s not enough seats for all the people that are staying at the hotel. Although the pool staff is very well-versed and I forget her name but she’s been there for almost 30 years and she runs a really tight ship. And there’s Nancy who makes the frozen drinks and the sandwiches I know that she has been there for about 29 years and she is a class act, pretty lady, funny with humor and very professional. Then you move on to the beach bar that is where you will find where the hard-core long-term employees are.. Peter, they main bartender has been there for at least 32 to 34 years as far as I can remember and there are several others that have been there 20 years plus & I think the least tenured bartenders has been there for eight years. TIP: There are two different mai tais available at the beach bar. One cost around $16.50 and is a wonderful mai tai don’t get me wrong. But there is a another one for $20 it has the premium liquor and will knock your socks off. What you do is you asked for the $20 mai tai minus the commemorative cup which is a plastic piece of junk anyways that you’re never going to want to keep. Declining the commemorative cup brings your cost down to $16.75 and Wala you have the best Mia tai for $.25 more but tip extra so they keep doing it. The property itself is simply a masterpiece. Do you feel like you’re in the last century and a plantation bill just for you. The rooms are incredibly appointed and the service staff leaves Notice Details on touched. Upon arrival at the valet you’ll be greeted with a flower lay and smells really nice. The valet staff is wonderful it’s simply cost to park anywhere in Waikiki it’s kind a like Manhattan New York so expect to add $40 a day to your hotel bill. Even if you parked in the public lot it would be $40So it doesn’t really matter you might as well valet. Budget a few minutes to get the car because it’s parked across the street and down the way in a multi deck parking lot tucked away so it doesn’t ruin the view. For yours and yours a gentleman and Kelly Sanders read this and for other properties are owned by Koyoa out of Japan. When Maria took over he move Don for one reason or another and there’s a new gentleman named Chad Harris I think and I left him a message that I was returning and didn’t hear back for 24 hours. But then I found out why he was off island traveling and the general manager of the Moana itself called my cell phone and told me the room that I wanted wasn’t available. He went on to say we found you a better room it’s a sweet you’re gonna like it so when you arrive just asked for the front desk manager and their recognize your name. There are 42,000 hotel rooms you could walk to you within 25 minutes of this one that I have to tell you whenever I come to Waikiki and in fact I actually live here now I always stay at the Moana Surfrider. The Bobway program sucks but the staff is incredible the property is unbeatable the views of Diamondhead and the beach in freight is the best that could be had in Waikiki which is the most iconic beach and most recognize beach in the world. I’ll post a few pictures but if you come to Hawaii stay here.","Waikiki, Hawaii","TRICOASTALbill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waikiki, Hawaii</strong>",10,5.0

Our room was well kept by the excellent housekeeping staff who were always pleasant and willing to do anything requested including delivering extra water bottles and towels. The front desk personnel were quite helpful and friendly. Our favorite staff were the fun people who ran and organized the ""towel hut"" and so graciously put out our towels on reserved chais loungers at the beach. Big thing to remember, reserve your chairs at least 24hours in advance. They get taken really fast!!! We visited all the hotel's restaurants and truly enjoyed all with the exception of the he Beach House which we had hoped would be a lovely dinner. Unfortunately, it was poor!!! Service was just okay.

Many restaurants keep the music loud so you don’t linger. As for the hotel, it was lovely, clean and comfortable. The room was the typical layout and amenities- nothing special but comfortable. I requested a room with a view and was not disappointed with a spectacular view of diamond head. Staff was pleasant but in general did not go out of their way to help. The pool area was small and very busy as was the beach. I rented a chair and umbrella for the day at $65 which was very pricey. The spot my chair was located in was a walkway where people were walking on me all day. In hindsight I should have taken the beech towel and sat on the sand!

We were in the the roped off area but very close to the public beach. This was followed by another homeless lady digging through trash and eating what she thought was still good.

When I went back to the front desk to ask for a new room I was literally laughed at by the front desk clerks who advised me when I asked why I wasn’t told about the room he said “I don’t sleep in every room” and then his colleague next to him openly laughed and mocked me. I figured there was no point in speaking to a manager because these guys were probably trained by that manager who themselves were trained by ownership and crap flows downhill.

Firstly the building has attracted me that’s why I chose to stay here this time. Checking in was ok but we have to wait for the room till 3 pm which I understand Inside was old and the minutes I walked into our room I went Omg the room so old , furniture ugly and old we have book the bigger room which has 3beds and one rolled bed , but just 1 bedside table which is another disappointing. Then I walk into the bathroom I immediately want to checked out but room already been paid too bad nothing much I can do . Bathroom was tiny. And the bath room door stupid enough is to open out so we have to used at least 3 floor mat a day or even use towel to clean water . Basin was so small can’t even fit all our make up . No tooth brush , no shower cap , no sleeper in room , no body wash .. OMG it’s worth than 4 stars and we paid like $1.100 aud + $40usd service fees and plus tax per night you will have to settle the bills with a lot of extra so be ready for that. Also be aware of booked room for 3 read careful because they will change you $125 usd per person which has never happened to me in any other hotel . When I booked 3 mean I already paid for 3 but with Moana you will have to be extra caution In room dinning nothing really great either. Every time we went out we don’t want to go back to our room because we don’t feel the comfortable of 5 stars hotel at all.. We won’t comeback to this hotel again The only reason I stayed this time just the location , excellent location that’s is all I like. Service in general wasn’t great if compare to most 5 stars I have been This review I wrote based on a very experienced traveller and I always stayed in good hotel , Moana is one of the worse on my list. The same amount $1100 aud i spent I could get a much better 5 stars anywhere around the world. So I won’t recommended if you like beautiful room and a clean beautiful bathroom this hotel only can provide you the building itself and location that’s all , sorry no in room photos because it nothing there for us to even take a photo !

I turn the lights on and discover the bed is covered in tiny centipede-like bugs. Could it be bed bugs?. Anyway I killed most of them. The next day I went to talk to the representative at the front desk, he told me that it’s definitely not bedbugs but if I wanted a different room, it would be an additional charge of $100 for the Premiere suite. I said I’d tough it out. When I was checking out two days later, I was not happy. Again had these bed bugs all over me at night. I should pictures at the front desk. The representative went to the back to speak to her manager, she came back and told me that these are not bedbugs, but TERMITES and I don’t need to worry. I paid $800 A NIGNT for this room and they offered to waive the $37 resort fee which is in addition to the $800 for my inconvenience with the termites. Also room was very noisy. I usually stay at the Outrigger Waikiki Beach Resort and the room is way better insulated because it is quieter. In summary, I paid more than $800 a night to stay in a room filled with inspects/bed bugs/termites whatever you want to call it. In return, my “resort fee” of $37 was waived.

When we first arrived we thought the lovely lobby gave us a taste of what our room would be like, boy were we wrong.When we checked in at 4pm, we were advised house cleaning were running late and our room wasn't ready. Not what you want to hear when you have been awake and travelling since 11pm the night before. We were then advised we were in a double room, even though we booked a partial ocean view king room. We couldn't change it as there were no king rooms left.We were told to walk around and they would call us when the room was ready. That was the last thing I wanted to do, so I just said we would get something to eat at the overpriced restaurant. After half an hour we got the call to say our room was ready and the lady kindly brought our bags out to us. We then went up to our room on the 20 floor and our partial ocean view really was just that as most of the view was of the huge air con unit on top of the hotel next door.I don't know why the cleaning staff were behind as our room didn't even look clean. There was dust on the skirting boards and the mirror had tooth paste all over it. You could see the joins in the wallpaper, as it was coming away from the walls and the carpet and chair upholstery was dirty, faded and worn.The bathroom was TINY and I expected a four star hotel to have a separate bath and shower, not a tiny shub. The bathroom vanity had no space to put your toiletries etc. The paint appeared to be flaking off the ceiling in the bathroom. This is probably due to the lack of ventilation and absence of an extractor fan, when using the shower. Bizarrely the closet is in the bathroom with no extractor fan and has no doors. Needless to say I didn't keep any clothes in here as they would get damp and possibly mouldy.To top this all off our room backed into the lifts and it was so noisey. After 20 minutes, we had both had enough and phoned and asked to be moved. I honestly do not know how the hotel expects people to sleep in that room with all that noise.The next room we were moved to was exactly the same as the first,minus the noise from the lift and we no longer had a view of the air con unit. Neither room had a book outlining services offered and telling you about the hotel.The pool is tiny and there are no where near enough chairs next to the pool or in the bar area for the amount of guests. The beach out front is crowded and you have to go a way down to get a bit of beach to yourself. The beach towel thing was weird. You could get beach towels but if you didn't return them, they would charge you $10. However no one takes your room number when you get the towels, so how they police this is beyond me.Lastly my biggest bug bear is the exorbitant resort fee. I must have read the a4 sheet outlining what it covers and I still don't see that you get anything extra at Moana Surfrider that you don't get at hotels without a resort fee.After speaking with other people it sounds like most of the accommodation in Waikiki is rubbish and really expensive, so it would explain why Moana Surfrider is so sub par and they don't appear to be in any hurry to address it.",,JackBrooke114,4,1.0

There were 2 rocking chairs facing the beautiful waters of Waikiki. The only downside was the very tiny bathroom, no real vanity , the water pressure on the rain shower was good. Be prepared, the food and beverage is expensive, more so than 29 years ago. There is ample food and restaurants outside the hotel. There are also several trolleys that can be taken just right outside the hotel for a nominal fee. The afternoon and evening performers were actually very good! One of them was Bruno Mars' uncle, he resembled Bruno in voice and appearance, very nice guy -Johnny Valentine. There are activities throughout the week and don't forget to explore the 2nd floor beyond the majestic staircase. There is a mini museum dedicated to the hotel. Exercise room was a nice size with good equipment, they also had 2 Pelotan bikes but they were always occupied. Daily morning yoga was complimentary and they were good with the exception of one elderly instructor.Downside: Most staff was very pleasant and helpful especially the housekeepers and Ken, the wait staff at the Veranda. He was an incredibly hard worker. He was running back and forth servicing everyone all night long. There was only 2 staff members that were unpleasant:I had a very rude and temperamental older yoga instructor. She pointed her finger at me when she didn't like my pose and snipped at me that I should take Yoga 101. There was no skill level posted on the hotel activity schedule for this class. Her lack of Namaste was appalling as well as her ignorance regarding customer service.The second staff that was unfortunately unengaged in her duties was a young woman manning the concierge desk. She looked welcoming, with her hair swept up in a bun with a flower; however she was not. I had spoken with her several times and the last encounter, she crossed her arms as if she was to say ""now what do you want""? She begrudgingly gave me a bus map of Waikiki and told me ""FYI these are the last ones I have left"". I bit my tongue, I wanted to say to her ""well figured it out and get more, that's your job"". By the way these are the same folks that sold my family a tour of the island to the Macadamia nut factory and the Dole plantation for a total of $390. If you are looking for a bit of history, do not purchase. The tour company basically unloads the bus to these places directly to the gift shop, there's nothing historical about it.It is a beautiful property. Just prepare yourself for some sticker shock. I did rent an umbrella with 2 chairs for $65 day. Another guest went to the local target and purchased a beach umbrella for $21 since she was going to be here for a week.

It’s a beautiful plantation style hotel and the oldest hotel in Waikiki built in 1901. The location is in the heart of Waikiki on the beach which can’t be beat. Marriot Platinum members do get use of the Club Lounge and the spa. Breakfast and Happy Hour are served in the Club lounge which is right on the beach. The spa is beautiful and it also overlooks Waikiki beach. Unfortunately there are a few negatives which soured my stay as a Marriot Platinum member.The worst thing is the front desk. There is usually a line for Marriot elite members and sometimes there is nobody to help and at the most there is only one elite check-in person. If you have any questions, you inevitably wait. At check-in, I was“upgraded” to a room with no view from the room, only a partial side ocean view from the lanai. I changed rooms to a Diamond Tower ocean view and it was much better. Also at check-in, I was never asked if I wanted the measly 1,000 points (worth about $6) or a local gift. I had to go back and ask for it.There is no more restaurant breakfast for Platinum members. While the Club Lounge buffet is sufficient, the restaurant is a few notches above. Marriot Platinum members still get use of the spa facilities which is very nice but the steam room wasn’t working the first day when I went. I asked for a 4:00 pm late check-out and got a 1:00 pm late check-out. I’ve stayed at the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani many times and the buffet breakfast is better but overall the Moana Surfrider is a much better hotel.There were many annoyances at the Moana Surfrider but it’s still hard to beat “The Grand Old Lady of Waikiki.”","Los Angeles, California","Mike D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",63,4.0

I called a week before, to insure that our two rooms were either connecting or close together, in house reservations noted the request and I felt confident that the requests would be taken care of. I find it completely unacceptable that the room type that I booked wasn’t available. This isn’t the first time this has happened to us staying at this property! They tried to offer me dining credits and no resort fee for accepting a lower room category. At 700.00 per room per night all I was asking for was was a higher floor in the category I booked. As a Bonvoy gold member I’m eligible for an enhanced upgrade, which means same category but a higher floor. As a gold member this means nothing at this property! Completely disappointed with this Westin. Seems to me they don’t care, it’s all about revenue. I still don’t understand why they sold my rooms I booked and that were guaranteed. So here we are on the 4th floor rooms 485 and 491 no sun looking on to a roof with a small view of the ocean and a very noisy kitchen across from us, nice!We got “left overs.” We checked in at 1:15 wasted a 1/2hour explaining why I should get the room category I booked. The front desk manager did apply a 100 food/beverage credit to 1 room. This being said, I would have rather had the rooms I booked on a higher floor. The resort fee is another thorn in my side, 37.00 per room/night. This property, doesn’t honour requests. Next time I will be looking at other properties that don’t sell my room to someone else and that treat me right. I wasn’t asking for much.

I was thoroughly looking forward to my stay at the Moana Surfrider. It’s a beautiful historic property right on the beach and smack in the middle of all the fun of Waikiki. Unfortunately, after being here less than 24 hours, I am really disappointed that I’ll be staying at the Moana Surfrider for 6 more nights.Upon checking in, we were not greeted as an Elite member (something that I truly appreciate and pay attention to because it’s something they ask in follow up surveys) despite being in the specific Elite queue. I wasn’t feeling well and travel exacerbated the pressure in my sinuses. I couldn’t wait to get checked in and settle into our room so I didn’t ask questions to confirm my Bonvoy Elite Welcome gift or Lounge access. I also didn’t ask for a hotel map, but shouldn’t all these things have been addressed without me asking?The room was as expected, for good and for bad. The Westin Heavenly beds were quite that and the noise from busy Kalakaua was as present as other reviews have stated. But I was okay with that because I understood booking a city view room would have that potential drawback.As a Bonvoy Elite member, we chose this hotel over others because of the Moana Beach Club Lounge benefits. We even received an email reminding us of this benefit prior to our trip. We were looking forward to having an exclusive place to getaway from the rest of the patrons. Luckily, we stumbled upon the lounge on our own because we weren’t given a map at check in. Unluckily, our card didn’t work to gain access into the lounge =\ Ughhh fine, I’ll have to go back to the lobby, but first I continued my exploration of the grounds.Overall review, this hotel does not have enough amenities to support their guests, non paid or paid! We went to the pool, and not 1 lounge chair was available. Okay, the pool is small, but the beach is right there! Let’s see about chairs on the beach. For $65 you can rent 2 chairs and an umbrella for the day. Okay, how do I do that? I’m told I need to reserve at the pool kiosk 7am the day before I want to reserve, and a tip to come extra early because there’s usually a line of 20 people waiting to do so and they do sell out. There is not enough free seating and even if I’m willing to pay, it still doesn’t secure me a space to lounge!Then there’s the resort fee. I know paying a resort fee is a common added expense per day, but in order to maximize on the benefits, you have to spend more $$. If you aren’t going to the spa, visiting Sea Life Park, learning how to surf, or working out, paying $35 sucks because it’s really only covering your WiFi and 2 bottles of water. Also, no matter how short or long your stay is, you get the same benefits per stay, meaning any of the 1 time use per stay benefits must be stretched for the duration of your stay. Again, I’m here for 7 nights so it a bummer getting less out of the resort fee versus someone staying 2 nights.I would not recommend staying at this hotel however, it is a nice place to visit and walk the grounds - ironic advice that makes this an even worse place for paying patrons to stay! We finally got access to the Moana Beach Lounge, a nice place to relax and write this review. Now that I got that out to warn others considering staying at the Moana Surfrider, I’m going to enjoy my vacation.

The location is great. Our check-in attendant could not have been more friendly. We were told that we were being upgraded to an oceanview which did have an amazing view. There are two rocking chairs inside the room facing the ocean. However, we were literally across from the elevator which is quite noisy. Another positive is that the sheets are soft and appeared new. Now, the not so positives. The room itself was tiny. Hardly any room to turn around. And the bathrooms are very small. There’s absolutely no counter space for toiletries, a brush, or blow dryer. Definitely too small for a family of 4. The walls were paper thin. We could hear our neighbor sneeze, cough and giggle all night long. You could hear them open and close their sliding closet doors. Fortunately, the air unit was so loud, it drowned out some of the noise next door. Definitely don’t stay if you’re looking for relaxation or a good nights sleep. Also, the shower floors were slimy and did not seem clean. Wear flip flops in the shower!The hotel has so much potential due to its location and historic value but there are so so many people.

While we would wine and dine there on occasion, we always wanted to stay in the hotel. It didn't make sense when we lived in another hotel all those years ago. So, that's how it ended on our bucket list for our return visit in September. I should clarify that we did enjoy ourselves at the hotel and it was worth the price we paid for our oceanfront room. Now, we did book and pay for our hotel rate through our travel agency and Blue Sky Tours Hawaii. So, the actual room rate was ""imbedded"" in the total package, excluding miscellaneous charges during our stay. Regardless, when you go to Hawaii and want the best, you just have to expect to pay for the best, and hope you are treated as such. In our experience here, we certainly got what we paid for with regard to our hotel room. We had a magical, beautiful view of Waikiki Beach and Diamond Head. This is exactly what we wanted. It wasn't the hotel's fault that the outside weather was one of the most humid and hot periods during our stay. Having lived in Hawaii, we realize this can happen. It was just one of those things. So, we barely were able to sit outside on the lanai and enjoy the view. We just could step outside for a few minutes. With regard to the other resort amenities, most of the time, they were very good as well. I didn't bring my laptop intentionally, but the hotel had a great setup with computer stations right in the lobby area. And, there was no charge for using their WIFI. Granted, I felt very guilty checking my email while all around me was this beautiful atmosphere. We dined several times at breakfast and lunch, including high tea out on their Veranda/Beachhouse restaurant. And, we thoroughly enjoyed the food, service, ambience, everything. While there were occasional ""hiccups"" in service, their ""service recovery"" more than made up for any issues we reported. Issues were not that major. For example, we assumed that since we were staying in the hotel, we would get some sort of priority at the restaurant. We were initially told that it didn't matter whether we stayed there or not. We were somewhat shocked about this response and let them know at the reception. The following day, while checking my darn email, the same receptionist saw me and offered to accommodate us for high tea and even comped us for it, aside from any beverages. That was extremely nice of them and more than made up for the initial response. The concierge lobby staff were also extremely nice. Even Room Service was extremely good and reasonably priced. Of course, the hotel's location right on Waikiki Beach and along Kalakaua Avenue is perfect if you want to stay in this area. What dampened our enthusiasm somewhat was their ""resort charge"" of $37.00 per night, along with valet parking fee daily of $45.00 per night. Then again, hotels are now notorious for their ""resort charges"" and it's extremely difficult if not impossible to find any decent (paid or unpaid) parking in this area (perhaps if you're local). One more negative: the Marriott Bonvoy points system (again, not the hotel specifically issue). Turns out, since we made our reservation through our travel agency, we were not able to collect any points, except for our miscellaneous charges...a real bummer). Be aware of this if and when you book using someone else. By the way, our agency claimed they didn't know about this policy. Hmmm???So, overall we loved our stay. But, you have to ""bite the bullet"" on the additional charges, etc. As they say in Hawaii still: ""It's the price of paradise"". And, it's still paradise after 20 years away.","Napa, California, United States","johnnnita</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Napa, California, United States</strong>",139,4.0

If you stayed over 100 nights at a Bonvoy property you would expect to be upgraded (even a little) wherever you stay. Not here. It will make no difference if you are an Ambassador or staying at a hotel for the first time in your life. There is no difference. If you booked the regular room, you’ll be stuck in a 210 sqft room with a small window to peer out at either a street or a courtyard. We will not be getting what you’re prolly used to for being a loyal Bonvoy member.

We had an incident and needed to see security. They were very supportive to me at that time and I appreciate their help and the respect they showed me. Food and beverage were very good. Service by room attendants each day was superb. They greeted us every morning and asked us if we needed anything. The cleanliness of the hotel was excellent.We love the location of the hotel, the history and the extras that a member of Mariott Bonvoy enjoys. The hospitality room at the end of the stay was appreciated as our flight did not leave until 10pm. We have a couple of concerns about the noise surrounding the hotel. Whether hoteliers in that area could have an effect on the local government or not, I could not say, however the noise from the main street in front of the hotel has increased since our last stay. Multiple buskers in one block all singing loudly (and amplified) at the same time creates a very unpleasant atmosphere in the evening. I spoke with one of the shopkeepers across from the hotel and she said it is like that all the time. She finds it unpleasant as well. Could not the buskers be give separate times to play/sing by the municipal government? I don't know if they were licensed but one group was very much involved in asking for money from the crowd rather than entertaining them. They were singing a madeup song about asking the group for money including ""if you only have a $20 we'll give you change"". They collect on street corners and create a crowd when others are trying to cross the street safely. On top of that when we were sitting on the rocking chairs on the veranda of the hotel entrance at night, the music playing from inside the hotel and at the entrance added to the cacaphony. One other incident that upset our stay occurred on Wednesday September 18 around 3pm. We were cooling off in our room for about an hour and there was a announcement that there was an ""emergency in the hotel and all guests had to evacuate immediately"". Of course we scrambled to pull on shoes and clothes and just as we were about to leave another announcement came on saying that it was a false alarm. Immediately after that a lound horn sounded for about a minute. We couldn't stay in our room at that point so we left - we felt unsafe (we were on the 18th floor in the tower building) and we are in our 60s. Other guests we met in the hallway espressed the same opinion. Later in the evening we asked at the front desk what had happened. The desk clerk said that someone had smelt smoke - cigarette smoke. Understanding that it was a false alarm, we were surprised that management would think of evacuating the hotel due to someone smoking in their room. There is a difference between burning fire smoke and cigarette smoke. Why not just knock on the door and tell the people to put out their cigarette? Anyway, we understand stand that it was a false alarm but it scared us and upset us very much. The explanation for the long horn sound was that it was a test for the regular tsunami warning. Why could that not have been advised to the guests ahead of time with signs saying that the tsunami warning would be tested at a certain time and not to be alarmed. The hotel management took the time to put a note under everyone's door on Friday that the street would be closed for a block party the next day, so why not take the time to put a note under everyone's doors about the tsunami testing? I asked that the hotel manager be informed about our upset. We heard nothing from him/her during our stay but the desk clerk apologized for the inconvenience.I noticed that the signs in the hallways say ""no smoking in corridors"". This implies that it is only the corridors where one should not smoke.... leaving the guest rooms and balcanies questionable for smoking. We found a small yellow and white card saying it was a no smoking hotel/state law, but it was mixed in with a bunch of other papers and brochures under the table next to the bed. We didn't find those until a few days into our 7-day stay. I know that signing the guest registry indicates no smoking but not all the guests staying that week could speak English and it is not really emphasized at the desk upon check-in. We smelt cigarette smoke about 4 times on our floor while we were staying there. I think the signage could be clearer in the guest room and corridor/public areas.FYI - We were also surprised at the exchange rate among the hotels and shops in Honolulu. .64 Canadian to US dollar. The bank exchange rate is about 10 cents higher. (this is not a hotel complaint but something that we will consider before returning to Hawaii in the future)Other than the above we enjoyed our stay and especially the professional courtesies and genuineness of the staff.

By the time we got to the elevator he noticed that he dropped them, so he went back to find them which was a max of 1-3 mins time-span but they were gone. It's upsetting to know that we stayed at a resort where they have thief's and our belongings are not secure. We immediately informed the front desk staff and they said to call the lost and found department (they didn't seem too concerned about the situation). I did notice that they have camera's all over the property but they didn't offer to review them in order to find the people that stole the sunglasses. My husband did notice two younger males that were sitting in the courtyard area when he walked by looking for his sunglasses and he overheard them saying ""there is the guy that dropped his sunglasses"". However, my husband didn't want to get into an argument on our vacation but it was upsetting to know that they let unregistered guests enter the property where people's personal belongings are.

It was my daughter‘s 21st birthday and it was a special present for her that she had been looking forward to four months. We were given a suite in the tower section of the hotel which had a very comfortable king bed, large balcony with views of both the ocean and the city. The bathroom was spacious with both a shower and tub. We also had access to the concierge lounge with a nice continental breakfast and appetizers in the evening. I would recommend a room in the tower as I believe the rooms in the older part of the building are traditionally smaller. The pool area is smaller than most newer resorts probably due to the historical nature of this hotel as the first resort built on Waikiki. The pool does close at 6 PM to allow guests to enjoy the poolside music and drinks. Drink prices at the beach bar are a bit hefty, $16 for a piña colada, however the live music was consistently excellent in the evening. The location of the hotel is fantastic both in terms of being directly on the beach and also in the center of the upscale shopping district. The best part of the experience was really interacting with the staff, which was consistently friendly and helpful and professional. Kyle, Christopher, and Shane at the concierge were extremely helpful in making this a very special experience for me and my daughter. Karen in the beach club learned our names on day one and always kept our wine glasses full. Mericar in housekeeping kept our room spotless and well stocked. Cindy at the front desk was amazing. If I had to come up with any negatives, it would be the resort fee, the high drink prices, and lack of variety in the menu each day in the concierge lounge.

As the oldest hotel in the area it has beautiful architecture and a breezy aspect with regular live music in the courtyard. The pool is outdoor and not open as long as most hotels (6pm closing) plus the number of deck chairs/cabanas is very minimal, but what they have is serviced well and people are not allowed to reserve in the morning and leave for breakfast. Any deck chair vacant for an extended period is cleared out for another guest. We stayed in a partial ocean view room which was beautifully positioned so the hotel next door disrupt our view and the size if the room was perfect for two people who needed a bit of space. The only big negative was housekeeping who did a very poor job of servicing the room and on one occasion didn't do it at all.

Its without a doubt one worst pool experience at any Resort style Property I've encountered over my many years of travel. (It should be noted, we stayed at the Moana Surfrider a year ago; had a similar issue, but loved the hotel so much that we let it go)Whats wrong with the Pool?1) Its tiny; way too small for such a large property2) The only view of the ocean from the pool is blocked by chairs & a retaining wall3) Its basically a kiddie pool. During most of the days during our recent 6 night stay, the pool was full of small, in some cases diaper clad kids. And when I say full, I mean full! Now dont get me wrong, families and small children should be able to enjoy a pool when visiting Hawaii, but what about the adult guests?4) By the time the kids are out of the pool, the pool closes at an awkardly early 6pm, so no chance for some pool time then either.5) The area around the pool is filthy. This is in large part caused by the lovely massive Tree in the center of the courtyard. It has a lot of wildly straggling branches that simply cut be gently trimmed back so that the pool area isnt constantly filthy.(we actually got hit several times by falling sap/nuts etc)The Solution: Please spend the money and create an adults only pool. The place to do it is directly between the pool and beach; in that narrow but big enough strip of concrete between the two retaining walls. You'd displace a handful of beach chairs; but having a useable adults only pool that looked out onto the ocean would be fabulous. Simply walk over to the Sheraton a few hotels down for inspiration. This wont be cheap and will require some work, but to the honest; with an expensive property like this; its expected, particularly when you charge resort fees for every day of the stay. Having an adult pool would pay for itself and could easily be made up for by tacking an un-noticed extra few bucks onto every room night, or raising the resort fee by a few bucks each day.As much as we love this property, we will not be back as we literally couldnt use the pool even once during our 6 night stay. Yes, thats our own fault, we coulda enjoyed being part of the human and kid stew, but no thanks.Please consider this an opportunity to make an already lovely property perfect.","San Antonio, Texas","txgerman1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",151,4.0

They even have Honolulu Coffee near the main entrance of the hotel, which was super convenient for us to stop in and get our caffeine fix every morning. Everything is within walking distance but if you decide on renting a car, valet is $45/night or you can self park in the garage at Sheraton, which is directly across the street from Moana Surfrider and costs $35/night.

We found our suite to be extremely spacious, modern, and clean. It had a large balcony with lounge chairs, mini fridge, microwave, sitting area with desk, and a flat screen tv. In addition, the bathroom is humongous. I loved the rain shower head and the water pressure was perfect. Some nice perks during our stay included free WiFi and newspaper (which my fiancé loved getting everyone morning). We also had access to the Beach Club Lounge. We were able to eat breakfast (which was delicious by the way) in their outdoor patio and relax by the beach every morning. The club also offers happy hour during the day with snacks and beverages- such as coffee, tea, and soda. What stood out the most during our stay was the customer service we received here. Everyone from the front desk, housekeeping, bellmen, and valet were extremely friendly and courteous. They always greeted us with a smile and even remembered us by name.

Certainly at checkin it did. After arriving late to the hotel we did not question anything till the following morning. I awoke then realised that the room's AC smelt of damp and that it had very little storage other than a wardrobe. I was with my partner and we had to make do and live out of our suitcases. The Banyam rooms are very small indeed. Went down to reception to complain or pay to get moved and NO suitable options were available so it was a like it or lump it situation. We did not come to Oahu to worry about a pissing hotel....Then you get to the staff (cleaners, concierge were excellent). Yes you'll hear about how time moves slowly; that's BS when the staff are checking there phones, scrathing their collective arses and heads seemingly looking busy. Very laxadazical attitude around the main bar and the restuarant. We just gave up and eat in other places which were far more on the point, responsive and deserved the accolaises. There are far cheaper places, with tastier food and tip deserving service.Its not the worst Starwood property I've stayed in, but at the price its a ripoff and the bar/restuarant staff are playing games. Leave them too it and find another hotel. If you need to stick within Marriott chain then many options just avoid the Moana. If its about the history then come visit, you can walk away to your nice hotel and not worry about rooms/service, etc.Will never stay at this hotel again, this is hoping its visitors are ignorant, dont travel alot and will put up with the flaws....

Be aware that the streets are closed for hours as the 2 hr plus parade goes thru town. We had a room facing the street, which can be pretty noisy as street musicians and crowd are out late into the night. The back rooms face the ocean, but will add to your price.We were in the older part of hotel, so rooms were smaller than those in the Tower, the newer section. Room was adequate, and the balcony was very nice. Small fridge, nice wardrobe, and a few small drawers in tv console.  Staff were super friendly and helpful booking our trip to Pearl Harbor, but the activities desk is only about 15 feet away from loud piano music, which did make it hard to hear. As a guest, you are entitled to FREE food in the Beach Club, all hours of day. We made the mistake of eating at the Beach Bar, where our chicken tenders for two with a pina colada came to over $75. The view was nice, sitting under the Banyon tree, but the drinks tasted like they had no alcohol and were very pricey!! ($16 each) It is a lovely hotel, and a favorite spot for weddings- half dozen a day or more! Many gift shops, spa, and exercise room as well.

Booked through AMEX Travel the trip was slotted for a ocean view king suite in the new tower. Upon arrival I was given the key to a garden view small room and instantly tried to figure out where the disconnect was. After 20 minutes at the desk with multiple trips to the back the concierge told me his manager found out AMEX had changed my booking and there was nothing they could do. As a gold elite member with 100 nights in the last 3 years I expected a bit more but I asked if I could pay out of pocket for the room I had booked two weeks prior and was told no that they were sold out and I was given a dual twin room in the old tower. This entire process took almost an hour with my wife and kids waiting so I paid the extra 300+ dollars and left the desk unhappy but putting it behind me. The next day after our room had been cleaned we returned to change for the pool and a plumber shows up to fix the toilet because the room cleaning crew had broken the handle on it and we had no idea. We also told the plumber that our drain in the shower did not work and he fixed that as well but the fact that two things broke within the first 24 hours did not bode well for the trip. The next day infact during a shower the water pressure went out with soap in my hair for about 20 minutes where I had to get out and dry off and wash my hair in the sink. All of these things are possible bad luck and coincidence until the final straw for me. Since I was on a buisness trip I needed to print out a manual for the customer I was working for and tried to use the hotel complimentary workstation and printer. I tried to print the 62 page manual on dual sided print which would have been 31 pages of printing but the printer was not working. I asked for help twice and was told if I couldnt figure out how to fix the printer to go to the activities desk and they would print it for me. After heading over there and emailing the PDF to their email they printed it for me single sided and completely jumbled as they kept taking about 5 pages off at a time and mixing them up thoroughly. After about 40 pages printed they said that this was too many pages and that there would be a charge. I said fine if you need to make a small charge to my room that is fine and left with the wad of paper he handed me to sort and re-order on my own. As I checked out of the hotel I find that to print those 62 pages they charge me 35 dollars... thats more than the ink cartrige and the entire ream of paper cost for what should have been a complimentary print. Suffice to say I have never been as displeased with a hotel as this hotel. There were some nice parts so I cant give it a 1 star but I wish I could. They were extremely curt with every interaction from the towel cabana to the front desk. The only great staff I encountered were the room cleaning staff and the bell hops. Other than that I had zero positive interactions with any staff or policies. For the prices they charged I would rather stay ANYWHERE else in Hawaii than this hotel and its by far the worst Marriott property I have ever stayed at.I hope they do better by other guests but for me it was abysmal especially for the cost and with status to boot.,"Columbia, Maryland","J2294RBjamesl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbia, Maryland</strong>",4,2.0

Let me start with the positives - absolutely gorgeous entrance and beautiful pool. The general staff is great and both the reception and housekeeping have been friendly. The club room that offers free breakfast and light bites in the evening is a nice touch - the ""snacks"" were not the greatest, but the staff kept refilling on wine (which was a nice gesture). For breakfast - for platinum members, just get the breakfast at the Veranda as your amenity gift, since the lounge breakfast looks like what you would get in an airport lounge. The negatives - read the reviews below before you book. The minute we arrived, we were completely overlooked. The valet had to be flagged down to help us and his response was how many bags do we have while talking to other guests. No welcome, no leis. I am a platinum member and received no upgrade - totally fine, since they are overbooked, but we also received the lowest floor and smallest room for our category. The banyan rooms are in the historic building and nice, but incredibly small (coming from an NYC resident) and honestly look like you are staying at at the Courtyard by Marriott. Not the cleanest, no amenities in the bathroom, ton of noise regardless where you stay and honestly can barely move. For the ""guest relations"" manager to email us ahead of time is almost a waste - at least attempt to find reasonable rooms for your elite members since you know ahead of time we are arriving. Also never even heard from anyone during our stay - usually at least get a note from the guest relations manager at most Marriott hotels I have stayed at. It was interesting to see this was not the case just for us - upon check-in the supervisor told another guest if he did not like his room (which was next to the elevator), he was happy to help him check out. Clearly they have issues with service and consideration at this hotel. Lastly, the pool has literally 20 chairs and its like the pool-chair hunger games trying to find a place to lay down. How this hotel attempts to charge a resort fee for pretty much nothing is hard to understand. We would definitely not return here and sadly the last part of my husbands birthday trip was a disappointment - definitely needs to be looked at in terms of their star rating and service.","New York City, New York","sbgass86</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",33,2.0

However, the perks, in my opinion, end there.Upon arriving with at least 12 pieces of luggage, a pram and toddler and the rest of my family, the bell hops completely overlooked us at the front door - they were more pre-occupied with taking photos of the bridesmaids at a wedding that was happening there. And once inside, at least another two bell hops walked straight past us without offering to assist. We took all the luggage up to the room ourselves!We had an ocean front room which had lovely views of the beach, but the air conditioning was so loud, we couldn't have it on at night which made for restless sleeps all round. The walls were also paper thin - I heard someone having a coughing attack every night in the room next door. Also, for such a big hotel - the pool is tiny and basic.I am not one to complain and I am more than happy to pay for a luxury hotel, but I would expect the service and amenities to match the price tag.

Elevators worked hard to get everyone up and down, sometimes they took a few minutes. Restaurant was good, a little pricey, but best views in Waikiki. Music everyday and night at the banyan court. Pool is average size for that area and well maintained. However, the pool closes every night at 6 pm!?!? WAY too early. Room service was hit and miss. Sometimes it was well done, sometimes I could have been better. Lanai was never looked at in the nine days we were there. Bird poop on railing and coffee spot on lanai table was there upon arrival, and remained there day after day until I cleaned it myself.

The location was ideal for us, right on the beach and close to restaurants and shopping. The facility is majestic and very charming with Hawaiian touches. Our room had a beautiful ocean view and our king bed was very comfortable. We fell asleep with the sound of the waves through our open balcony door. The bathroom was a nice size with an electronic bidet which was a nice touch. Although I prefer a shower over a shower/bath combination, the water pressure was good.Here are a few cons that made me deduct one star:- Unpleasant front desk staff. It’s as if they were programmed to say no to every request with no apologies. No “how was your stay” or any genuine concern or appreciation for being us being a guest or loyal Marriott Bonvoy elite members.-One of the older female pool towel staff was hovering over the complimentary beverage container/dispenser near the counter and embarrassed a guest when he used a regular paper cup instead of the flimsy cone cups they offered. She said something to the effect of use the cone cups instead so others can try the beverage too. The paper cup he was attempting to use was sturdier than the cone cups and wasn’t going to fill his cup too much more than the cone cup. She made it seem like he was being greedy by using a better receptacle. Regardless, the bland watered down juice/beverage was part of the high Resort Fee the hotel charges and not really complimentary. They need to make the beverages taste better, replenish as necessary and give guests better and environmentally friendly cups.-The Breakfast Buffet really needs improvement especially at the $38 per person price point. Duke’s buffet is much better for $18 per person.- Change the faded blue umbrellas at the beach! They’re an eyesore for such a majestic property.We would consider returning here overall because of the location and room but the service and other areas noted above will need to improve.","San Francisco, California","Soulfultrvlr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",105,4.0

However, a few days after we left the hotel we noticed a charge on our credit card for $112 CAD (about $85 USD), I called to inquire thinking we had missed something during check out or were inadvertently charged by mistake. Well, to our surprise, there is a $40+ resort fee charged to all rooms per night. We spoke with the hotel representative (Todd) he assured me this would have been listed on our confirmation. It was not. After he reviewed our confirmation, he agreed it was a miscommunication and his supervisor agreed to waive the resort fee for one night. Well, it has been 3 weeks since we left the Moana Surfrider and over 2 weeks since talking with the hotel. We still have NOT been refunded the resort fee.

At around 10:30pm this evening, an alarm went off throughout the entire hotel saying there has been an emergency in the hotel, and everyone must evacuate. The entire hotel is leaving their rooms, and when we get downstairs, no one has any idea what’s going on. Everyone is panicking, concerned as to what was going on, and the staff had no idea that there was an alarm going off. Their response was simply “it must be a false alarm.” Not at all reassuring. When many people begin asking to hear from a manager or security to let us know if we’re ok, no one would come. The staff begins yelling at us, showing no empathy, or even trying to see what the situation is. After finally returning to my room, I called BonVoy to see if they can help me get an explanation of what’s going on, and if we’re safe. They reached out to the hotel, but the message they relayed back to me was “they are changing shifts right now, and will get back to you in 5 minutes or tomorrow morning.” It has now been over 20 minutes, and no one has reached back out to me from the hotel to tell me what’s going on.This is UNACCEPTABLE, and makes me fear for my safety in the case that there may be a real emergency. The staff here doesn’t seem to be able to handle these situations. The service is awful in that no one can answer my questions, or even get back to me to tell me what’s going on.I do NOT recommend this hotel, and I don’t recommend anyone to stay here.

The long time staff are still there and offering great service, Gloria and team at the pool and beach, Nancy at the snack bar and the friendly staff in the Beach Club. But all of the family observed changes that were subtle but definitely noticeable. They are now selling timeshares in the tower elevator lobby, the focus seems more on selling real estate than hospitality. Prices have gone up for the rooms and certain amenities like the Beach Club, but they are offering less. In the Beach Club they have cut out simple conveniences at breakfast like hard boiled eggs and salads. In the evening, they no longer offer a warm protein. The edamame is cold and for a snacks they offer barely edible, slimey cold cuts. It reminds me of a badly executed airport lounge rather than what should be a nice club room at the hotel.

The property has enormous potential, but is let down by rote service and poor attention to detail.The Westin offers a bland, cookie-cutter stay in the heart of Waikiki. The enormous potential of a historic property in a prime location is let down by lackluster service and poor attention to detail.Location: The Moana was the first big resort hotel on Waikiki, and the original building dates to the early 20th century. Additions, including a high-rise tower, have since expanded the property. The hotel is in the middle of Waikiki’s retail and entertainment strip, and on a good - if very crowded - stretch of beach.Rooms: We stayed in the old wing. Note that the rooms and bathrooms are quite small. The door could barely open without hitting the bed, and the king-sized bed and our luggage took up almost all of the floor space. We didn’t have a balcony or ocean view. If you're on the tower side of the old building, you’re very close to the balconies of the tower rooms, and have a view of nothing except the tower. Anyone sensitive to noise should avoid the inland side of the hotel, which is subject to noise from traffic and street performers. Food and amenities: The pool is small, and packed. We didn’t eat at the hotel. Service for drinks at the beachside cafe was adequate. There’s an interesting exhibition on the hotel’s history on the second floor of the main building.Service: Here’s where the hotel underperforms. Laden with luggage, we walked into the old building and searched in vain for anyone who could tell us where to find check-in. Check-in itself is delineated by a Vegas-style rope line, an indication that you’re going to be processed, rather than welcomed - and that’s exactly what happened. After waiting in line, the clerk greeted me with “Just wait a second” as she scanned her computer. Perhaps it’s a hangover from the Starwood acquisition, but it took a long time for the clerk to find my Bonvoy information.I was on a business trip (granted, not the hotel’s typical demographic!) and needed to shine my shoes. When I asked if there was shoe-shine service, I was told yes, and then someone arrived at the room - not to pick up the shoes, but to give me shoe polish (in the wrong color). Housekeeping was spotty (see photo of the A/C vent in the room). Twice, the soap dispensers were empty in the lobby restroom. It’s trivial, but I had to laugh when the drink on offer in the lobby was marked with a card reading “guava elixer” - even details like spelling seem to be beyond this place.Pick the Westin if you want an adequate stay and the sense that you’re another tick on Marriott’s tally. Otherwise, look around for a property that offers better value for money and starts with a focus on the guest.","Hong Kong, China","16outandover</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",166,3.0

The historic wing in the center is on the national register of historic places and is breathtaking. When you arrive it looks like an old Hawaiin Plantation with the White columns. Because its a historic hotel, nothing can really be changed that would change the structure, and that would include soundproofing on the windows. The windows still operate on a pully system and for those who enjoy old historic hotels from yesteryear with modern amenities (but very small rooms), then this is the building to pick. The historic wing reminds me of the Hotel Nationale in Havana or the Saratoga and everything has been beautifully preserved. However, because the hotel is located in the ""Times Square"" of Hawaii, it is very busy outside with a lot of noise and street performers. If the noise bothers you, do not book this wing, ask for the more modern tower. We stayed in the historic section 1 night and the manager graciously moved my entire family (3 rooms) over to the quieter and more modern tower for the remainder of our stay. The tower rooms are larger with lanais but will be a little more $$ to book but worth it. We are adventure travelers so most of our activities happened outside the resort and in the mountains or at sea, but when we arrived back late afternoon for the breathtaking sunsets, we were always greeted by the friendly valet and bellmen by our last name... nice touch. The hotel restaurant for dinner was very good, but quite expensive (typical for Waikiki) and I recommend the tasting menu. (If you want something more authentic the venture out of the hotel). A grand banyan tree dominates the outside sitting area by the beach and during the entire day there's a Hawaiian band playing music with a hula dancer. The pool is too small to accommodate the hotel size and the beach is very crowded. Remember that all beaches are public places and hotel guests from other hotels cannot be prevented from using the beach behind this centrally located hotel so it is crowded out there. The hotel however, does have a small section reserved for their guests. The surfing behind the hotel was quite good and you can rent surfboards and paddleboards. The beach is much smaller than last time we visited as there appears to be a lot of beach erosion which is happening everywhere because of the rising seas (we are from Miami so we are aware of it). Overall a solid 4 stars. Compliments to the entire staff and manager for such a wonderful stay. The manager was probably the most professional I have dealt with over the years and Westin is lucky to have this gentleman running this resort.","Davie, Florida, United States","David L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Davie, Florida, United States</strong>",50,4.0

Having said that, the average night cost just over $500 after taxes/fees (resort fees and parking fees) and the issues below made the value behind the cost minimal. You could definitely do better for the price point.1. No where on the hotel website does it indicate that the $35/night self-parking fee is for an off-site 5 floor parking garage more than two blocks away from the resort with no elevator. I am thankful that my son and I are able bodied and could do the climb to the rooftop parking daily but if you require handicap access, you have no choice but to pay the $45/night valet parking fee. This is important information that should be clearly stated on the site.2. Most beachfront resorts include beach chairs in their resort fee, this resort does not and charges a $60 up charge per day for two beach chairs and one umbrella.3. The resort only has 4 elevators servicing 20 floors in the tower making it slow to reach the lobby and your room if you are on the higher floors. We were on the 13th floor. One elevator broke down and was out of service making it even more difficult to get to the lobby/room. There were lines to get on the elevators from the lobby. When I asked about the stairs, I was told they were for emergency use only. When you have an elevator down, the staircase should be made available for those who would like to use them as an alternate method.4. The hotel needs a update ASAP, and room servicing was not detail oriented. On arrival, I had to clean the refrigerator with disinfectant wipes before using it because it had brown spills on the bottom shelf. The ice container was not emptied and the glasses were not replaced on several days. The bathtub was backed up. I had an ant near the fridge which tells me the rooms are not that clean and another small black bug crawling up the wall. There was no coffee on our last day when we were traveling and needed it the most. The room thermostat was set to 65 degrees Fahrenheit and it was wrong. The coldest the room ever felt was about 75 degrees. To this point, I was fine with it because I don't like my AC that cold but for someone who does, they would have thought it was warm in the room. 5. Air conditioning throughout the hotel in general was not great and certain areas didn't even have air-conditioning (the elevators, bathrooms (near gym), hallways on the floors, lobby.Had I known all these issues, I would have stayed at the Hilton beach front which was comparable in price and the amenities included on-site parking and beach chairs. Their facility is also more updated and upkept. At $300/night, all these problems/issues would have been more acceptable.I would not choose to stay at this resort again on visiting Waikiki.",,Irene E,2,2.0

We stayed at the Ritz during the first trip through Waikiki, but it was a little far from the beach and decided to stay at the Moana during our second trip through.First of all, the staff was amazing - we were only supposed to stay one night, and I thought I had changed my reservation to two nights and apparently hadn't and they accommodated us. I also ordered online deliveries to the hotel with no issues. Second - the actual building is incredible, they did an amazing job of keeping everything feel authentic to what a historic building it is, but also everything is renovated and modern. Third and most importantly, location! It is right in the heart of Waikiki and right on the beach. We paid for an ocean front room, and I highly recommend you do the same. It's right on the water and there's no bugs, so we slept with the doors open both nights and listened to the waves.One thing I'd say is that the room was quite small, so although this was amazing for 2 friends or a couple, I wouldn't stay here if you're a family. If you're only 2 people, don't even consider anywhere else, it's AMAZING and I would take it over the Ritz any day.

We were invited to wine Wednesday which served quality wine and nibbles. We also enjoyed the spa and sauna rooms, just separately as it isn’t unisex. The pool seating situation needs evaluating as it is unfair the people can hog poolside lounges all day and that you have to pay for shade and chairs on the beach.

The room was small, but who cares with the views of the ocean view nobody in their right mind would complain. The Banyan tree was stunning at night. The food was pricey! We were celebrating our 25th Anniversary and my husbands 50th so we wanted something fantastic so we opted for the Beach House/Veranda on the property. They gave us a spectacular table with ocean views and the service was wonderful. We opted for the pre fix dinner and found the meal underwhelming.

We loved Dukes Market for wine--awesome selection and the prices weren't out of this world. There are oodles of Udon places around--it's a thing there! It's amazing and should be tried at least once. We rented a car for one day from National, which is around the corner from the Moana. It was $65 for unlimited mileage. We navigated our way to the North Shore easily using WAZE. We were able to visit Kailua (#1 beach in the US for 2019), as well as eat lunch on the North Shore easily in one day.

We didn't have a balcony but we did have a great view of the patio, tree, and beyond to the ocean. Our room is equipped with comfy linens, robe, high thread towels etc. that you come to expect at upscale Westin/Sheraton (now Marriott) properties. Everywhere you walk you get an appreciation for the history of this place and the fact that it is the oldest hotel in Hawaii. The 2nd floor is actually a museum of artifacts of not just the Moana but of Hawaii and its people. Take time to appreciate the architecture.My favorite activities: Be sure to enjoy a late brunch at the Beachouse restaurant and on another day lunch at the Beach Bar (Banyan Patio). Grab a morning coffee at Honolulu Coffee next to the hotel then camp out on the rockers to do your morning people watch.

This post is dedicated to giving huge kudos to four Moana Surfrider groups:1) front desk personnel 2) club level personnel3) hotel security 4) the banyan tree1) Thank you to manager Christopher for helping us fix a huge mistake that was made by the person who booked our hotel stay for us. He was able to make our last night at the Moana enjoyable instead of an annoying ordeal. We really appreciate his efforts. In addition, our check-in person was awesome and was able to get adjoining rooms for our family of five. 2) If you’re contemplating whether or not you should upgrade to the Club Access, do it. The team there is on point and super-friendly and accommodating. The club is located on the main lobby level close to the beach access so very convenient. The staff are always there asking if you need anything or clearing your plates. The food selections are really good including fresh fruit, veggies, eggs, etc. I’m vegetarian and gluten-free and they had gluten-free bread and lots of veggies every day so I was happy. Great coffee machines too. The place is run like clockwork. 3) BIG Thank you to the two 6-foot-something security men in their tropical shirts who were by our side within minutes of calling when a man from another hotel was being inappropriate. Let’s just say after seeing the security men, I think the perpetrator made himself disappear and we didn’t see him again. And to be clear, this was a person randomly doing something lewd, not anything where we ever felt threatened or in danger. Waikiki Beach is safe, clean (spotless really!) and perfect for families. 4) The ginormous banyan tree (on the beach!) needs it’s own Facebook and instagram accounts. The tree was planted in 1885 and is over 130 years old. Magnificent is an understatement. The tree alone is reason to just book your stay right now. Thank you to all the hotel grounds staff for keeping it healthy and alive for since 1901. I read dozens and dozens of reviews about all different properties before booking this trip.

This was the first time our family of five stayed at the Moana; previously we stayed at The Marriott Waikiki, and a non-Marriott hotel. Our room was in the tower section with an amazing view of diamond head and the beach, breathtaking!!!! Others have posted concerns regarding rooms near elevators, our room was right by the elevator; while there may have been some noise, it did not prevent us from sleeping, or rest. Others have also posted about noise from the night activities/music at the Moana. We traveled from the central time zone, so a five hour difference, and again, had no problems sleeping. I think having the drapes closed helps keep out some of the noise. Previous reviews also mention the layout of the room, specifically the restroom. I appreciated the safe being in the restroom area as it provided extra counter space; it would be nice if there was a divider between the shower and the rest of the washroom, but I guess there’s only so much that can be done with the size of the area.As I mentioned, we’re a family of five (three young children), I was concerned about staying at the Moana and “kid behavior”. Overall, our family was treated marvelously, and in true Ohana fashion (even when our kids were fighting over who gets to push the elevator buttons). Below is a breakdown of Moana staff that made our trip memorable...-The crew at the towel hut...they recommended Faith Surfing Instruction for our 11 yo; this is one example of the knowledge and passion this team has for the area. Each time we went by for towels we were greeted warmly and with enthusiasm. We rented an umbrella one morning, stopping by the previous evening to inquire about the process (having read reviews regarding the process, we wanted to make sure we understood how this worked).-Housekeeping...Kam is amazing!!!!! Kam ensured our room was clean early; she also left us plenty of towels/linens, bottled water, and an immaculate room. There was at least one day Kam was off, and her presence was missed. Kam always greeted us warmly in the hall, and even complimented our kids on their good behavior.-Karen from Beach Club; Karen moves around with a hop in her step, and radiates of kindness. Karen was eager to answer our questions, and made us feel right at home. Karen went above and beyond in making sure we had somewhere to watch the Stanley Cup Finals.-Shelton from Beach Club; Shelton always had a smile, and was quick to clear dishes from the table, as did Karen. -Haley checked us in and is not only an asset to Moana, but the Marriott brand. Haley is well versed in Platinum benefits, and the check in process; it was as if Haley knew every question I had regarding our stay, and answered them before I needed to ask. Haley was also eager to help with an instant point redemption during our stay. A few notes for Platinum Members, our experience included:-a room view upgrade-a late check out of 2.5 hours -Full access to Beach Club (this made staying at the Moana a great value. The Beach Club regularly had bottles of water, fresh bananas, fresh apples, a fabulous breakfast buffet, day snacks, and a decent light dinner assortment (especially when we had a late heavy lunch)-Mini activity books for the kids","Saint Louis, Missouri","Passenger452602</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Saint Louis, Missouri</strong>",5,5.0

The food amenities were certainly limited, and no one came to clean our room (which can be tough when you sprinkling sand out of your clothes each day and night).

We spend HOURS AND HOURS dealing with their incompetence, especially since they NEVER responded to our emails, or answered the phone during normal business hours to help us resolve this matter. Our bank finally completed the charge-back because of the poor communication from the hotel management.

First, of course is the location on Waikiki Beach. This property is right on the ocean -- beachfront -- so the convenience is unbeatable. The hotel is partly historic, and Starwood (now Marriott) has upgraded and maintained the hotel well for the most part. The hotel is divided into 3 parts. There is the original historic hotel that houses the lobby and restaurants on the first floor. Two towers comprise the other two parts of the property. The only true, unobstructed views of the ocean are in the Diamond Head tower. The service is generally good, but there were a few staff that didn't seem so thrilled to be there. When we arrived, we were told that they did not have an ocean view room with a king bed. They offered a room with two full size beds. That was not a good start. We said no. It felt a little like bait-and-switch. After checking with the manager, the desk clerk came back and said that they had found a room with a king bed. For $600 (plus a bunch of add on fees and taxes), we were not settling for less than the room we requested. If you reserve, get the rate with the pre-paid breakfast that has a buffet. The food is really expensive. Our first night, after the room check-in incident, we wanted something light to eat. We ended up ordering two salads, a beer, and glass of wine - nothing fancy. The bill was $150. The food was of good quality, but it was the kind of thing that we might pay $50 for somewhere else - even in Waikiki.This is a place that will nickle and dime you to death.

Shampoo, lotions and soaps provided as well as a hairdryer.The wardrobe had robes, slippers, coathangers, iron and ironing board.The view of the beach from our room was perfect. The staff were all so very friendly and couldn't do enough for you.This hotel has alot of history, so check out the ""museum"" on the 2nd floor. Sadly, we didn't know about it until we checked out.We had breakfast included in our stay. Upon check-in we were provided with vouchers for the breakfast buffet. At breakfast, we presented our vouchers to a lovely lady, who was always so helpful and happy(even under pressure). We never had to wait long to be seated.The breakfast buffet has quite a variety of choices. There are pancakes, cereals, fresh fruits(pineapple, watermelon, strawberries, rockmelon, honeydew melon to name a few. Toast, muffins, eggs benne, fresh made omelettes, many Asian choices as well. The food was always fresh with again, all staff being super helpful and polite.The hotel is on the beachfront, so swimming is easy to do. To obtain as many beachtowels as you need, you go to the poolside kiosk, scan your hotel card and you are handed your towels. When finished, just hand them back to the kiosk. Staff there, are also very friendly and helpful.Check-out was very easy, with quick check-out available, just drop your room key into the recepticle provided.As we exited the hotel to wait for our pick up to the airport. We were approached by staff who asked if we needed a taxi or did we have a pick up organised. He took our large bags and said he would look after them for us until our bus arrived. Again ultra polite and helpful.Overall, our stay at the Moana was an exceptional experience. From the beautiful hotel to the fantastic staff who made sure our stay was a memoriable one.

No advice re what to do for a few hours. No offer of a cool spot to sit and wait or offer of a drink. Bar staff service is terrible. Can sit for minimum 20 minutes even when bar is nearly empty and wait for service. Tried to find a drinks waiter and was told not their table but they'd find someone else !!Concierge/tour desk was rude and unhelpful and felt stupid for asking a simple question.Not sure what you pay the resort fee for as a couple there are no real benefits but fee is compulsory. Pool chairs and beach chairs are all gone by 7am although we were happy with the sand. A beach umbrella would have been nice for shade.

Our check-in staff member was absolutely thrilled that we were on our honeymoon, and made us feel very special. Excellent service at breakfast. We also felt very silly after doing a lot of shopping - we asked the valet if we could leave our car outside the hotel while we ran all of the shopping bags up to the room. Instead he loaded them all onto a luggage trolley and brought them right up to our room for us, while we parked the car. ROOM - We booked a Partial Ocean View room, and were allocated one on level 11, facing out the right side of the building (when facing the beach). We had quite a generous view of the ocean from our balcony. The room furniture was modern and did not feel dated, compared our Maui hotel. We also laughed at the Japanese style automatic toilet (with washing and drying feature)!!LOCATION - Right on the beach on one side, and right in the middle of upscale Waikiki shops on the other side, could not really be better!

This is just as difficult for any seasoned TA visitor: just which part of such a melting pot are we writing to? My personal favorite has always been the classic Victorian grand hotel, the Surfrider, which has survived both a few changes of management and even the beach hordes on its gracious steps. Clearly, many of its contemporary clientele (who may think that a luau shirt qualifies as dinner dress), this is no fault of a magical legend of early Hawaii trying to survive the ages. So this review is happy to report to all those travelers of such different stripes that the Surfrider has managed its own time-fold ways to satisfy most of you. It's up to you top know how to navigate the rest.  The simplest customer is simply the bargain-hunting beachcomber. If all they need is a mattress, a beach and an all-day bar, it's all at the best spot for surf and trade winds; that's why they built it here a century ago in the first place. But for the more fastidious (or nostalgic) travelers, the royal Surfrider can still show its regal side, even if it's a bit more difficult to find. The original wing's floors, each of which was built from Banyan or a different wood, has been carpeted over, but the luscious open-air breezeways remain across its lobby and terraces; from the entrance to the courtyard, the gentle wood rocking chairs are still in place. If you're drawing comparisons to the other original beach palace, the Royal Hawaiian, all bathed in sunrise pink, in my opinion, it has been submerged beneath a seat of upscale mall shops.  The Surfrider, of course, has now added new wings to the original, some smaller, warren rooms requiring a hike to the nearest elevator, but here's where a little advance scouting helps: the reservations, concierge, baggage and customer service desks are all impressively loyal and personally attentive; you may even forget there are hundreds there beside you. Room and housekeeping service are just as responsive: a room can be cleaned up, on request, within an hour or so, and empty trays are picked up before you even notice. The range of rooms, from classic verandahs and plantation shutters to suites with beach and city balconies, are available, but require going through a maze of advance scouting, worthy of some resort paleontology. They can all be found, up to your preference and your budget, but buyer beware: don't leave it up to online reservations.  Finally, the hotel's spa and fitness center are all updated and the best that can be found this side of Eden. You will also find a young and athletic crowd present, maybe a surprise to find them sharing the same historic and romantic hotel that you are. Best of all, the Surfrider's open-air, Oceanside, verandah restaurants for breakfast and dinner are literally in a different space and price point from the bar menus, but in the evening their sense of peace and old Hawaii tides and breezes may remind you that the calming ancestors of Waikiki are still there with you. One non-property warning: the local taxi drivers can be notoriously ill-mannered and poorly trained (mine couldn't understand the directions to Waikiki or the Surfrider. Arrange beforehand for hotel shuttle or service to collect you.","Kansas City, Missouri","william m</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kansas City, Missouri</strong>",33,5.0

One of the big plusses for us of the hotel was location, and it doesn't hurt that you can walk out of the hotel right on to the beach and have fun immediately with the kids. The beds were excellent and we all slept well, and having a balcony off the room allowed us adults to have our coffee while the kids slept in.The restaurant buffet was pricey but very nice, and it's worth the wait for an outside table. Front desk staff and room service staff were always helpful, friendly, and added brightness to our stay. Where things fell down was at the bar. We waited forever to get served, the person barely spoke with us (we had to actually go up to 2 different people at times) and the drinks I thought were overpriced for what you got. So while we did do the buffet the first morning, for all our other meals we preferred to eat outside the hotel.For those with kids, the zoo is only a 10 minute walk away. We even did a long hike to Diamond Head direct from the hotel, but TBH I think unless you are in good shape you are better off Uber-ing it over to the trail head.

If you forget anything, the ABC store across the street is the best place to stock up. You can even buy poke and other food items there for lunch vs. having to go to a restaurant, which is smart as the nearest Starbucks is a 5-10 minute walk away.","Seattle, Washington","feiba0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",7,4.0

Plenty of shopping & eateries walking distance.Elegant Grande Dame lobby & restaurant on veranda.All staff we encountered were very nice.We reserved a King oceanfront room... only room with 2 double beds available when we arrived. This was a large corner room but without the French balcony.We were moved the next day to a King room with balcony on 7th floor. Much smaller than corner room, but having balcony was lovely. Rooms could have better soundproofing & A/C noisey in both rooms.Coffee maker & tea kettle, mini fridge in room, 2 bottles water provided daily.Hotel does a large business with Japanese... 2nd reception area for Japanese speakers, all menus, many signs English & Japanese, programmable toilets, Japan airlines office on site, convenience store with many Asian snacks & ramen to go.Daily weddings, 1 with very noisey reception, thankfully quiet after 7:30 pm.Pool small, like all Waikiki hotels. Saline filter. Most lounges around pool claimed by early am. Sign said towels would be removed after seats empty 1 hour, but staff did not. You have to take over an unoccupied spot yourself. Only 1 side of pool area had umbrellas... the hotel easily could remedy that.Bar area under beautiful Banyan tree next to pool with short menu. Electric music, mostly Hawaiian after noon.Veranda/ Beach house restaurant very nice but pricey... like most of Waikiki. Delicious lobster bisque, Bacon, lettuce, lobster & tomato sandwich, perfect steak.Had room service for first breakfast... a $12 delivery & tray charge were added to food cost. This was not mentioned on menu. After adding a tip our small breakfast was $90!In summary hotel would deserve 5 stars if minor changes were made.","Lafayette, California","JoE1901</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lafayette, California</strong>",19,4.0

You can walk to stores and restaurants easily. Our room was comfortable and quiet. We had a decent view of the beach in our partial ocean view in the tower. There is a coffee shop onsite that is great. Housekeeping did a good job We did encounter some problems with our stay but overall it was a decent resort. Not for sure we would stay here again but not terribly unhappy. Cons - The pool is very small and close extremely early. People save chairs starting at 6am and you can rarely find a seat. The beach area is very small and chairs are very limited. We did not have the opportunity to rent them because they were always reserved. The beach is not good for families. Two boats(large) pull up and take up so much space and make everyone get out of their way. Parking is not good. We had to pay for valet all week because the parking is pretty far away by the time you walk through the garage and through another resort. The breakfast at the Veranda was wonderful every morning. The staff there were fabulous. However we had terrible service twice at the beach bar. We were charged for things we shouldn’t have been charged for and had terrible service. They do not have very many options either to eat. The staff was not friendly here overall besides the waiters we encountered at the Veranda and the valet staff ( of course we tipped them well also). I’m not sure one person smiled or acted like they were happy to be there. If I had some suggestions it would be more management onsite, better training, longer pool hours, more beach chairs, free beach toys to use and return, cheaper valet since the parking garage is not convenient, more items on menus for lunch and dinner, healthier and gluten free options for people with allergies, Lei welcome for members, open the veranda for lunch.","Louisville, Kentucky","mikeandju</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Louisville, Kentucky</strong>",8,3.0

They have a policy that I imaging was created in a back room after the GM threw up his hands and said I can’t think of anything else and let’s just make it easy for the staff. They’ve created a Hunger Games type of competition to reserve seating for $60 a day. 1/ you have to reserve in person the day before, so when you arrive no chairs for you and by the way, none for the next day. 2/ the next day you arrive you have to be in line by 7am to reserve for the following day, there were already 17 people in front of me at 6:30am. 3/ if you can get a set of chairs, they are yours for the entire day whether you sit in them or not. When someone does leave for good day at 3pm, they put the chairs away and do not let anyone else use them, or even pay to use them, nice! 4/ on the last day, I heard someone say you could get a chair for a half day due to availability, but since no one, not the front desk, not the beach staff ever explains these beach chair policies, you have to figure it all out yourself.Let the games begin!PS hotel was booked when I stayed there, maybe a better chair experience when the hotel is not at capacity",New York,"Kitchenkat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",19,3.0

Right on the beach, front and center. I love the ambiance of the place having been a guest 20 something years ago when it was a Sheraton. It is certainly very expensive but hardly at the top of the tree as Hawaii is an expensive place to holiday. We initially chose a Banyan city view room because of price but upgraded at $US100 to a beach front tower ocean view premiere room after a long tiring flight from Sydney. Tower rooms are looking slightly dated and needing some minor interior maintenance but worth it for the view, ocean sounds at night and bigger size of room.. Waikiki you have to expect crowds even in the Moana Surfrider which is a shame as the hotel exudes style but it can be a bit hard to see through the people to the finer details of the old hotel. Beautiful beach front location so why fuss about the pool? Pool loungers are at a premium and almost impossible to get due to 'hogs' who reserve them but hardly use them from early morning till night.All beachfront rooms suffer from some daytime 'fun' noise from people enjoying the ocean directly below and the expected 'Hawaiian amplified singing/ musak in the early evening.

First off, this is the first hotel ever built in Waikiki and the reason why it's called the First Lady. The hotel is gorgeous with its classical open air decor that leads to the terrace and beach. The service and staff here is phenomenal. We had no problems getting assistance with any request. We stayed in the Tower Premier Ocean View Room with a View of Diamond Head. Its was worth every penny for the view. They have onsite restaurants, gym, spa, a pool, and beach rentals. The list of included amenities that the resort fee covers is definitely worth it. It even includes a one day GoPro rental. Yes, resort fees suck but to us it was worth it this trip. The pool is a bit on the small side but who goes to Hawaii to be in a pool when the beach is just steps away. Also, for those who complain about Waikiki Beach being crowded just get there early or later in the day. Enjoy the fun of the island.

The staff worked very hard across this period, keeping us informed of the latest situation, ensuring that there was plenty of available hot food. This was essential as Waikiki was effectively closed down for 2 days. The hotel itself is right on Waikiki beach, and is in a beautiful old main building, with two towers on either side. We had a partial ocean view room, but would probably go for the full ocean view in future. The room was big enough for our family of 4, with a decent size balcony.

I’m so gutted we stayed here during our trip to Hawaii. It looks beautiful from the outside of the main entrance, however, it’s a different story when you go inside. Huge tower blocks where the hotel has over-inflated the amount of rooms but not increased the guest facilities. Tiny, cold pool and an expectation to pay to use a sun lounger and parasol on the beach. I am well travelled and have NEVER experienced this when staying within the hotel’s section/sun lounger/parasols on the beach.They also disgustingly charged me extra to stay in all a king size bed - which is what I had paid for on booking. When I realised this I went berserk, admittedly it seemed Chris had sorted it, however I’ve just received my credit card bill to find that they’ve still charged me for it. I’m livid. I’ve already contacted the resort/umbrella company that owns the hotel for a refund on the “daily resort fees” which they sell to you as taxes, yet are actually more ways for them to steal money from you - surely when I’ve booked the hotel, I’ve paid everything within that price?! I have had no response - disgrace.Furthermore, there was boarding up around the beach cafe area which wasn’t advertised anywhere on booking/prior to arrival: it made the resort feel smaller and completely blocked sunset views.Hugely disappointing stay, and would suggest you go literally anywhere else!

Corner room so tv was put on side wall and not on a swivel bracket so watching tv laying in bed not really practical due to angle.We stayed in the old part of the hotel so windows were thin glass panes which let every bit of noise in- mainly traffic and buskers. Awake every morning at 5am when the delivery trucks across the street started arriving and beeping horns and reversing beeps. Shower door opened out so poured water onto the floor everytime. Poor water pressure for size of shower head and the basin had very little space to put out toiletries and cosmetics so it was very cramped. Lack of towel rails/hooks. Staff- a bit rude and unhelpful at times. Some were lovely. Pool bar and restaurant- despite being a guest at the hotel and paying resorts fee there is no discount for this. Anyone can use these without being a guest at the hotel and pay the same price for food and drinks which is unfair. Service charge for 6 or more people of 18/19% and then same amount for tip on top makes it even more expensive. Again- hotel guests should be given 10% discount and service charge waived. Pool bar area had construction so sunset view obscured. Noisy. Singers/music was the same stuff every night- where is the diversity??? Two nights out of our stay they had piano player inside the hotel but again- no diversity. It seems they expect all guests to be the same. Also served drinks in PLASTIC disposable glasses with plastic straws- I heard Hawaii had gone plastic straw free??? I expected more eco-conscious products in a beach front hotel with heritage like the Moana. Same with hotel room toiletries- although there was a recycling bin in the room and hotel foyer too. Resort fee - no activities after lunch/early afternoon so it was impossible to get value out of the resort fee as we were sight seeing etc during daytime. One day I did go to crafts on the verandah- but it wasn’t on!! Tried to opt out as I knew we wouldn’t use services offered but was unable to and told it was compulsory. 6 nights equaled $226 USD. For which I managed to get two yoga classes and about 10mins Internet each day. Internet i didn’t need as I had my own travel data!! They offer gopro hire- but you have to go to another hotel to get this. There was no Wednesday morning sunrise ceremony as per checkin handout as I checked the foyer computer for updated info. Something I actually wanted to and could have attended. Hotel will book day trips for you- but I would advise against this as it is so much cheaper to book stuff yourself direct instead of tours. Especially if you have use of a car while you are there- but you have to park away from the hotel.Positives- comfy bed. Clean hotel. Central location. Overall- disappointing stay.

The Royal Hawaiian on the other hand has been overtaken by a shopping complex, and many of its spacious “historical” lobbies are vacant and under-utilized.The bar and restaurant staff at the Moana Surfrider seemed friendlier, and that hotel generally had a better vibe.If you like grand old hotels, your choice is between these two.

Our agent asked the hotel several times if there were renovations going on and they kept saying no until we sent them a photo of the bar, their excuse was that they had put up a pop up bar to replace it so it wasn’t counted as a reno.

There is no room on the lanai, so next time we would request a room in the newer wing.As platinum members, we enjoyed breakfast and happy hour- very generous and the staff serving there were great.

I'd skip altogether or spend 1-2 nights there and then head up to the North Shore of Oahu and stay at Turtle Bay, which is night and day different than Waikiki Beach. Waikiki Beach is extremely crowded, loud, a big city, and there are tourists everywhere. It's busy just like any big American city and reminds me a little of Miami Beach in regards to business, traffic, noise. With that being said, if you are going to stay in Waikiki the Moana Surfrider is a nice place to stay. It has a great location in the middle of the beach, has better beach space than most, and is an overall nice hotel. It looks big in the pictures but is actually smaller than most hotels there at the beach. ***Please ensure you stay in a room on the courtyard or ocean side, NOT a room on the street side*** We arrived from the North Shore and were shocked by the traffic, noise, tourists and overall busyness of this area. We were put initially in room 601 and spent only one night there. We got NO sleep. Street performers play directly below your window until 10:30pm, motorcycles, buses, ambulances and other vehicles pass by all night long, a garbage truck came through at 5:30am and didn't leave the area until 6am. Also keep in mind this is the first hotel in Waikiki Beach and the walls have very little insulation to noise (unlike cities on the mainland) and you hear everything through the walls. Needless to say, this was the opposite of relaxing, it was noisy and honestly we considering leaving and going back to the North Shore. Thankfully management was very receptive to our complaint, and we were moved the next day to 615. The new room was on the courtyard/ocean side of the hotel and was a totally different experience: quiet, peaceful, relaxing. We slept great in this room. Neither room had a balcony and both are small rooms. The restaurants in hotel are exceptional. They are expensive but its Hawaii so we expected this. We had fresh guava juice every day. A musician is almost always playing in the afternoon near the pool. Staff throughout was friendly. My advice would be to stay here in Waikiki for 1-2 nights and then go. It's worth seeing the area and the water is very clear in Waikiki and sunsets are beautiful.","Raleigh, North Carolina","aem2190</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, North Carolina</strong>",13,4.0

When I walked down to the front desk, there were actually several staff staying there. So they just chose to ignore the call? On the second evening I heard very loud singing noise from my room. The staffs were not helpful at all. They first checked the beach bar per my ask. They didn’t give me a feedback though. I called half an hour later because the noise was still there. Then I found out the noise was not from the beach bar because it was closed at that time. Now that we know someone was singing down the street at 11:30pm, I don’t understand why the staff told me she would send another security people to the beach bar “because I asked”. What’s the point here? They are not trying to solve a problem. They are not better then your Siri. Then this staff transferred my call to her boss. Her boss promised a room change for me. Then the boss quickly transferred me to the front desk. They picked up the phone this time. However, they told me all the room they have were facing the street, which I doubt a lot since there’s many empty room in different booking websites. I asked them if they can help me to call the police, because it’s almost 0:00. They agreed. Then the singing noise stopped for like half an hour before it started again.In one word, bad facility, unhelpful and unfriendly staff. Not worth the price.

I took a screen shot of the Expedia price, then went on the Moana Surfrider’s website and booked direct. When I checked in, I showed them my screen shot and asked them to honor the price. The front desk guy got his boss Joseph Woodworth to come out and talk with me. He said he wouldn’t help me with the price. I explained that I booked direct even though it was more money to help them out. He seemed indifferent. Then I asked him for any kind of help, and he went off on that I wasn’t a diamond member or special enough to get any help from him. It was horrible!!!!

The beach was great as was the pool. The staff at the beach/pool desk were so friendly.

It could get quite noisy at night (performers/ singers would park across the street with varying levels of talent...) but they usually stopped playing by 10 or 10:30 (just know that you can hear quite clearly what is happening on the street below). The noise likely wouldn’t be an issue if you go to bed late however if you have trouble sleeping it may be beneficial not to have a banyon big room that is facing the road. It wasn’t much of an issue for us (except for one guy that played a few nights that was pretty off tune!). The housekeeping was great. All staff that I encountered were friendly and professional.

The irony is that this hotel sits in the key location where the Pono Aloha might rest ... it's not felt. It's almost like a Walmart version of Hawaiian Disney. There are very few gracious greetings from employees as you enter the foyer or walk through the aisle. The only exception during our 6 night stay was the guy cleaning the sand from the bottom of the pool and 2 of the 4 house keepers we met daily. The thing is, this hotel could be something AMAZING, but it's not. It's just located in the right place for peak tourism, and the structural heritage beneath it's façade still graces the street. The truth is, it feels like a business owned by wealthy corporations who know nothing of quality customer service and loyalty. It's just a fancy rat-race.Back to the Westin (Marriott/SPG/Ritz) loyalty in Honolulu, the primary name on the loyalty account MUST be present for loyalty to be rewarded, despite the fact that we both use the account and this rule is only administered in this city. This must change.On a positive note, the room was clean yet small. My original room was a ""partial ocean view"" - this room type is a farce. You have to lean over the balcony to see a partial glimpse of the ocean between the Surfrider and the building 50 meters across from you. You WILL be staring at people staring back at you in these ""partial view rooms"". This marketing is rudely misleading. After a discussion with management, I was graciously given improved accommodations - none however to match the Platinum loyalty promise. Reviewing both room types, the bathrooms are small, there is no place to set up toiletries other than shallow shelving for @ toothbrush & paste. The air-conditioning struggled in both rooms, and toilets also strained to flush efficiently. The Westin heavenly bed, as always was a pleasure to sleep in. There were sufficient USB plug in and room lamp lighting was satisfactory. Due to the fact that our Westin Loyalty was disregarded, we intentionally ate outside of the hotel. A shame, because room-service breakfast in bed or an evening lounge cocktail was specifically what I desired on this essential R & R getaway. On the flipside of that, the hotel is so convenient to a multitude of incredible cuisines or just a take home bottle of bubbly and nibbleys from the ABC store across the road suffice for a relaxing afternoon in.The beach is small and crowded, the water, of which is only credit to Mother Earth is always refreshing, and is perfect for floating and chilling ... but you don't need this hotel for that experience.

To the contrary, the Moana Surfrider exemplifies the quiet and historical class and elegance we were looking for, in addition to beautifully decorated rooms, extraordinary hospitality, and magnificent views of Diamond Head and aqua waters of Waikiki. The beautiful Victorian exterior of this hotel stands out among the ‘concrete jungle’ of resorts on Kalakaua Avenue. The main public spaces encircle a giant lush banyan tree that provides welcomed shade and serenity following a day of watersports or sunbathing. Superb service and endless hospitality from the bell, housekeeping and Moana Lani Spa staff, and excellent dining at the Beach Club Concierge, the Beach House, Veranda and Beach Bar, completed the experience. Moreover, the resort is in a prime location, as when we were looking for a more lively and casual experience, Dukes and Hula Grill were just steps away at the Outrigger right next door. Our only hiccup was that, as Platinum Premiere Elite, we were not automatically upgraded and were assigned the room we booked despite availability (I routinely check online immediately before checking into SPG resorts). Eventually, we were upgraded to a beautiful studio suite with a huge lanai and beautiful view of Diamond Head. We most definitely will return to this special place.","Falls Church, Virginia","Sassy T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Falls Church, Virginia</strong>",64,5.0

And not in a good way.When we arrived, they simple didn’t bother with our traditional lei greeting, which was not a big issue, but was just an indication of the somewhat don’t care big hotel attitude that pervaded the place. Others did get them, but the staff were just busy chatting to each other. I had asked for an upgrade via messenger as they didn’t respond to emails, and did have an acknowledgement of that, also asked for something special for our daughter as it was her birthday.. When we checked in, nothing about the birthday, had no record of the room upgrade request, and when we arrived in our room, it had two balloons with congratulations Mr and Mrs Lee.. I guess somebody else was disappointed too. The porter did say he would sort it, but nothing happened.The room was tidy and clean another, and serviced every day with no issues, a tad tired and could do with a bit of a refresh, but the shower was huge and had good pressure..Pillows were either very hard or very flat and super soft, but that it what you are used to of course.We didn’t go for the breakfast as it was super expensive from past experience..Getting a seat at the pool was a huge mission, as they were in the midst of revamping the bar, which had been going on for four months due to strike action on behalf of the workers. The pool staff reserve heaps of seats for regular visitors, and I do get this, but this is a huge hotel with very very limited pool seating, even less as they have taken some away for the bar construction. It is very frustrating to try and sit in the sun with heaps and heaps of empty seats as they have been held for people who may or may not turn up. They also say that you can only reserve a seat for an hour, which is fair, but a rule that rarely if ever is followed.. They need to add more seats, stop reserving for people who may or may not turn up and have a better way for monitoring how long people block seats unattended.. Having said that, when you did find a seat, it was fairly nice, but the volume of kids running around diving into the pool, uncontrolled certainly takes the shine off things, and whilst I have no issue with kids, we have 3, the way in which no staff seemed to even be around never mind say or do anything was quite annoying.Staff around the pool to take orders for food were basically invisible, and most people went to outside places and brought in food, such as drinks and pizza etc due to the almost non existent staffing levels. It was odd to see people bringing in food and sitting at tables with staff occasionally walking past..Also after around 4pm, the noise from the bar in the next door hotel made sitting near the beach just very unpleasant.The seats at the bar area were pretty nice, although with the construction going on, there were less near the beach, and with a big barrier, it obscured the view a little.We chatted to several off the bar staff, who were very nice, Brandy in particular, Margaret was also very nice, but most of them were simply doing a job and very obviously not at all interested in helping the customers. At one point I spotted 7 staff just chatting at the makeshift bar and nobody serving customers.. A real issue especially as they were wearing badges about supporting workers rights.. Seems that they have a little forgotten about why they are there, and whilst they deserve a fair go, they would be well placed to talk to the customers far far more than they do.At one point I waited 45 minutes for a beer. A lost opportunity for more sales and for them, more tips.Still, they have the location with great sunsets and trade very much on location these days as service and looking after the customers and providing that something special is very very much a think of the past.. This place is now a mass market hotel with indifferent service, high prices and low staff quantity to do the minimum.. Not what you pay for at all, and for charging a resort charge for a pool with few seats, a bar with few staff and poor range.. What is the charge actually for ?The other unpleasant change is the addition of heaps more tables and chairs nowhere near the bar, but in the way of the banyan tree and even walkways. Clearly an attempt to add even more people to the Moana Bus so as they can get more and more and more people in.They are also about to become a Marriott as they can run more conferences etc etc, which is fine, but many nights you could not get to the bar or the seats as it was full of business and conference people, again, why charge a resort fee for things you can not get anywhere near.. We also were frustrated by many public areas roped off for groups.I do have to comment on the music. Every night they had a couple of people playing Hawaiian music, but it was so loud some nights you could simple not talk to each other, although this did have the positive of emptying the bar quickly.. You would think that they would notice that. Whilst I like Hawaiian music, it was too much, too loud and to my ears, and I do understand music, as I play myself, they were simply not good. Still I walked through the Sheraton a few times, and there music was even worse.. Overall, it is not what it was, just a mass market hotel trading on name and location. The pool area is tired, poorly staffed and not well managed. The Bar area is the same and not the pleasure it was in the past. Poor service, poor food range and packed in to maximise every dollar, which is ironic as if they had more staff offering better service, they would make more.Sadly I would no longer recommend the Moana Surfrider, and would not plan to return to this hotel. Others have better prices, better service and just more of an attitude of actually wanting to make your stay a positive experience, not the felling of staying in a churn and burn hotel designed to grab your every dollar.Finally, we did try and book some tours, but the staff really didn’t know too much at all, and had limited English.. Some places they said were not available, which just translated into they don’t get a kick back so we will tell you that to sell something that they do get money from…America at its best, give me tips for service that this not good as the companies don’t pay the people or employ the quantity or quality of staff to make it the experience and ironically the profitable business that it sure could be.Moana..

The highlight each trip is the Afternoon Tea on the Veranda. It is early afternoon and it is time for Afternoon Tea.Ambience:Sitting in the elegance of a classic Victorian architecture, feeling the slight ocean breeze on a warm afternoon under the shade of the very large 114-year old banyan tree, listening to the sounds of the water rushing onto Waikiki Beach soften by the melodic Hawaiian music; it was the perfect setting for Afternoon Tea. Food & Beverage: Top Tier Plate - Spicy Tuna Sandwich: mixture of tuna, black pepper, cucumber, & mayonnaise — not spicy, but tasty.Truffle Egg Salad Sandwich: mixture of chopped hard boiled egg, chopped scallions and chives, truffle oil, & mayonnaise — very appetizing & delicious.Curried Chicken Salad Sandwich: mixture of curry, chopped chicken, & cranberries— yummy & very tasty, the slightly spicy curry chicken is balanced with the sweet cranberry.Watercress & Cucumber Sandwich: thinly sliced cucumber and finely chopped spinach — very good, light and refreshing.Roast Beef on Sourdough Bread: it is ok.Middle Tier Plate -Devonshire Cream: better than heavy cream with more fat percentage, it is tastier than heavy cream.Lilikoi (lemon) Curd: smooth consistency with mild lemon flavor.Orange Cranberry Scones: soft & light — The scones tasted great with both the Devonshire Cream and the Lilikoi Curd. Bottom Tier Plate -Dulce de Leche Cream Puff — very tasty.Pumpkin Marshmallow Tart — very nice.Chocolate Macaroon — it is ok.Strawberry shortcake — it is ok.Lemon Poppy Seed Financier — yummy, very lemony.Green Tea w/Lemon Grass Sorbet: helps to clean the palate — deep lemon flavor with green tea in background.Service:Our server greeted us and provided water glasses. After indicating that we will have the Afternoon Tea, he brought a box of fragrant tea leaves and explained the flavor of each one. With 6 different distinct tea leaves, it was very hard to remember the settled differences. He would repeat the description again with a cheerful attitude. He brought the 3-tier tray and processed to name each one of the sandwiches and pastries. He checked on our water glasses and replenished our teapot frequently.It was great to enjoy a leisurely afternoon in one of grandest hotel in Honolulu, sitting under the shade the 5-story Banyan Tree in the central courtyard, listening to live Hawaiian music, and watching the little birds fly in and out picking the crumbs off the floor of the veranda. It is still the BEST AFTERNOON TEA... in Hawaii at the Moana Surfrider Hotel.","San Francisco, California","Larry-Calif</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",84,5.0

I can tell you this: it’s luxury stopped at the facade. I e been traveling to Hawaii for years and have always wanted to stay here. I should have passed. First I booked a top grade room through Expedia for $516 a night. 3 nights $1700 bucks. What I got: a cramped room in the “diamond wing” meaning diamond head side with two double beds which could classify as twins. It had two rockers to enjoy the ocean view which were nice. Small parapet balcony you could stand on. The room was clean with worn carpet. The wallpaper was coming off in places. The door stop in the bathroom was punched into the wall. Over all about a $300 dollar a night value. Getting up to the room was a burden. One elevator services the Diamond wing. Prepare to wait. The hallways have no elegance at all and make the hallways in the Shining look elegant. Beach and pool. Be prepared to wake at the crack of dawn to get chairs on the breach(which they charge for) or by the small pool. At 7 am all the beach chairs were reserved already for the next day and the poolChairs had been snagged up with saving towels the pool is small and you shouldn’t. E allowed to save chairs like this. Breakfast was included and thank god. Mediocre buffet fruit pancakes weird European meats etc. wouldn’t have paid for it. Lunch was decent ahi tuna poke bowl was good. Had to ask to have bird poop wiped from the table. The place was packed kids since it was post Christmas holiday. Couldn’t be helped but not my scene. Overall I’d give the Moana Surfrider a huge pass. While the grandeur of the front is awesome the insides lack the carry through.

Acknowledging it was the busy festive time it was not as good as it should have been. In the 8 days we were here I don’t think once anyone asked if everything was OK. The lines for breakfast sent us elsewhere everyday and the pool area just dire. We were told to line up at 630am the following morning to get a chair or book an umbrella for the following day. Even that early every single pool chair had a towel on it but only a dozen or so people present. And we couldn’t move towels. We did manage to secure an umbrella for the next day at the cost of $60. The staff appeared overbusy at the bar and rushed to put your order down and move on. All in all nowhere near as good as previous stays and no acknowledgement of my gold status either. We did eat at more than one other hotel on the strip and found service to be much more pleasant.

Check in was late ... 5:40pm. Clearly the place was swamped for the holiday and the manager did give us very generous compensation for the delay. The room was upgraded to a very larger ocean front suite. Great rain water shower head and Toto toilet as well. The club level amenities were very good. Breakfast was an excellent buffet. The later snack was a nice assortment of food as well. The bar restaurant was excellent... quick service and great Ahi Poke. The veranda for lunch was also very good. The only problem was the line there for breakfast was very long so we stuck with the club buffet. Again holiday crowds are difficult for any property if that is a problem maybe go a different time. The water of Waikiki beach is beyond fantastic. Big Wave Dave surf lessons were a great option. Valet was 45 per night... fair price for the locale.I did not see another hotel in the area that looked nicer. Plan to return! Great option.

We visited January 14-22, 2018. Our fourth stay at the Moana. Bought along two other couples. The property is lovely and perfectly positioned and much of the staff is above board. The beach club is nice but redundant in selection especially when staying a while. Biggest complaint continues to be the lack of pool chairs for a hotel this size It is grossly inadequate and becomes frustrating if not up bright and early. The partial obstruction of the beach by the $$ cabana beds still questionable especially when the area could provide ten additional pool chairs. The kicker , there is a $37.70 a night resort fee on top of the already overpriced room and You pay a considerable fee for beach lounges, umbrellas and self parking. At least for the first few years of our visits the fee included self parking. Who knows soon there may be coin operated rockers on the verandah. We are scheduled to stay again this coming January so I’ll update my thoughts when we arrive. Lets see if the Marriot has made any positive changes, I know they’re already increasing the resort fee......if not, I think we’ll spend the next five years at another beachfront property.","Long Island, New York","Withak66</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Island, New York</strong>",35,4.0

First, the location is great, it has easy beach access, nice pool, beautiful lobby, it’s right by some great shopping I thought this would be a perfect hotel for me and my friends. However, the rooms are very small, there was barely enough space for me to walk around the 2 double beds. The bathroom was filthy, there were hard water stains all over the shower, it looked like the cleaning services never touched the shower the entire time I was there and the hand held shower head was broken. I went to the front desk to request a bathroom cleaning but it didn’t look like anyone cleaned when I came back. I had a safe in my room that had a hole drilled trough it so it was completely unusable. I had some excursions planned and wanted to lock up my valuables, I had to go to the front desk where they had storage lockers but you need a managers key and the key to your locker to open it. When I got back to pick up my stuff the manager on duty couldn’t find the managers key so she had to call another manager. This whole ordeal took 30 minutes so I said forget this and just kept my valuables on me the rest of the time I was here. I did talk to another manager about my stay and he waved the resort fee but when your on vacation you want a clean hotel and to know your valuables are safe.

There must be new ownership? It’s like it’s just a “get them in get them out” concept with boring “modern” decor that doesn’t even try to be charming anymore.

This time I stayed 10 nights at the Surfrider, my first time at this hotel. What the hotel does well:Food & Beverage: From room service to every bar, red restaurant and tea service, the food quality is exceptional highlighted by local ingredients. Architecture: The hotel has preserved the historic details, first hotel on Waikiki, but never feels dated. Only elegant and comfortable. Banquet Staff: I lead meetings on the property and the banquet staff, especially Bob went out of his way to make everything seamless. I work with a lot of hotels but the genuine dedication shows the true Hawaiian spirit. What didn’t go well:Check-in: I had coordinated arrival time with the hotel in advance of my arrival however when I arrived my room was not ready. Food & Beverage Selection: during the 10 day stay I ate mostly at the hotel. On a couple of occasions I wanted to order something for dinner from what I knew was on the lunch menu. They absolutely would not waiver or allow me to do this. If they are going to be that steadfast, they should have a more expansive menu, as I was having the same thing multiple times. Capacity for guests: Twice a colleague and I wanted to have a drink and dinner at the hotel and could not find a seat. Since I was on a longer trip it wasn’t that big of a deal, but if you only have a couple of days in Hawaii and you are paying to be at such a nice hotel you expect to be able to use the amenities.

He asked us what else we'd like to hear & as he continued playing & we continued clapping & talking with him, the seating started to fill up with other guests! We & a good number of others ended up staying for the rest of his performance because he would play anything & everything we requested, was engaging us in conversation, made us laugh with some funny lyrics & even played a romantic song & encouraged us to slow dance (which 3 couples did).

It’s a beautiful, historic hotel with modern amenities in the right places. It just felt and looked like we thought the Hawaiian experience should. It was close to all the Waikiki restaurants, shopping and “action,” but while at the hotel it was our beautiful oasis away from everything. Nice, small pool area partially under the beautiful banyan tree. And the sand was just steps away. What truly made this experience amazing was the room upgrade we received upon checking in. Our room, 1595, was just perfect. Balcony off the living room overlooked Waikiki beach, just astounding views. Large and well appointed living room, very comfortable bedroom, and we loved the bathroom too (I now need to invest in heated toilet seats). It was all great!

This hotel used to be one of my most favorite Westins and that's why for the last 8 years i tried very hard to exclusively book this hotel when my destination was Honolulu. I have stayed at the Royal Hawaiian and Marriott in Waikiki when the Moana was sold out. My October 24-30 stay was so miserable that I don't know if I can ever stay at that hotel again without experiencing PTSD. That hotel stay felt like torture for the following reasons:1. cleaning my own room2. emptying trash3. going to certain floors in search of clean towels and other room amenities4. self-parking at a lot on another street due to no valet5. headaches due to the NONSTOP, loud picketing of the disgruntled employees on the beach side and street side of hotel utilizing loud speakers, drums, banging of pots and pans, cowbells, and whatever obnoxious noise maker they could think of utilizingto make matters worse i spent over $1800 to be tortured at this property. This was the very first time i could not wait to LEAVE Hawaii. This is not a smart tactic for a state that depends upon the hospitality industry for jobs and revenue.I feel I need to be compensated for enduring this torture as I did not get any advance notice that this was going to be the circumstance at the hotel. Getting a break on the parking and resort fee does not make up for the trauma I endured. Additionally, I have business travel end of January /early February 2019 and where in the world am I going to stay as I hear the strike still persists???

We were there to celebrate my husband's birthday and our wedding anniversary. I was looking forward to staying in this ""luxurious"" piece of Hawaiian history. The Arrival:- Upon arriving, you will be greeted by union protesters with bullhorns and drums. The hotel staff - housekeeping, restaurant staff, etc. are in the middle of a labor / wage dispute. What I find WRONG about this is that the hotel was very intentional in NOT communicating this dispute and the resulting disruptions it would cause to their upcoming guests. - Checking in was easyThe Room:- Ours was located in the Banyan Wing. We had a partial ocean view, directly facing Diamond Head. - At less than 300 sq ft., it is a small room. I felt the furniture could have been arranged in a more practical way. - The Westin touches were all there, including the Heavenly bed (which truly is heavenly) and the Heavenly robe. - There is no lanai.- Because of the protests, housekeeping was non existent. Instead, the hotel rolled out huge pallets of towels, and boxes of toiletries for the guests to help themselves. In our five nights there, housekeeping called on us twice. - The pillowcases were dingy. There were stains. I asked for a new pillowcase, and the ""fresh"" one that I was given also had stains on it. Gross. - For as long as the dispute is happening, expect to be woken up at 7 am every morning. The Grounds:- Stunning. However, because of the protests, neglected. - Pool area is small, but right off the beach. There is a small slice of sand cordoned off from the public, where you can rent umbrellas and beach chairs. - We rented a poolside cabana twice - ~$65 USD for a half day, ~$100 USD for a full day. There was one person running poolside service who called on us perhaps once every 60-90 minutes.The Food: I can't speak to because their restaurant / room services were shut down as a result of the labor strike. The Staff/Services:- Prior to arriving, I called the hotel to make arrangements for airport-->hotel transportation. I had the most difficult time just giving the concierge my basic information because she couldn't understand me. She said it was because of poor reception which was an ABSOLUTE LIE!!!!!!! As it turns out, the (loud) protests were happening right outside of the concierge area. It was hard to even have a conversation in person, much less over the phone. I don't think anyone likes being lied to. So unethical. - During our stay, the SAME concierge was useless. We asked for tips on waterfall hikes, North Shore excursions, and paddle boarding. The most help she was able to offer was to hand us brochures. You will be better served using a concierge elsewhere. TIP: Just around the corner in King's Village, there's a great concierge service for luaus and other land excursions. BONUS TIP: Want stand up paddle boarding or surfing lessons? Check out Big Wave Dave's Surf Co., just around the block from the hotel. Overall:- No thanks to or help from the hotel, we still had a fine time in Hawaii. You're right on Waikiki beach, and there's not much that beats a Hawaiian sunset. - With that being said, I don't think we got what we paid for. In the end, it felt like we rented a self-service AirBnB and NOT a Westin hotel. The hotel should be ashamed. This ongoing dispute is a true disservice to the legacy of this historic local landmark. - I'm an SPG-turned-Marriott rewards with status. I almost exclusively stay SPG-branded hotels for work and for play, and this Westin unfortunately fell way below my expectations of the brand.","Los Angeles, California","BNescapee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",10,3.0

From over 40 years ago, I have been coming to visit friends, family, and have loved bringing my own children here. The Moana Surfrider is one of the best hotels - location in the center of Waikiki - ease of beach access, the beautiful Banyan Tree, so many weddings - it's always fun to see all the bridal gowns. The strike is awful. I support first amendment rights - but this goes beyond the pale. The strikers at Local 5 are actually quite scary to me. It's one thing to exercise your rights, but to reject reasonable raise offers, and then use shock tactics on guests is not in the spirit of Hawaii. Militant chanting, beating on drums, ""We Want Our Share"" at noise levels of 104 db (I am measuring). I politely asked them about their strike requirements and was met with indifference and rudeness. So...onto the helpful stuff - ask to stay in a room on the ocean side - then the noises are gone and you enjoy the peaceful beach. Hang out closer to the ocean and it's very pleasant. The staff at the hotel are really kind and persevering despite the noisiness from the outside. When I spoke to people outside of the hotel and local friends - the sentiment seems to be indicate that the strikers have gone too far and that there are plenty of local folks willing to take these jobs. The pay rate is not unreasonable. $22/hour and now $12/hour increase on top of that stepped up over the next several years, full insurance benefits. The HI police are also saints - having to endure endless droning, drumbeats, shouts and shrieks all day of We Want, We Want. Guests can at least go into the hotel grounds and enjoy the ocean. They asked the strikers to keep it down, and instead the strikers raised the sound even higher and banged their plastic bins harder. Sad situation but eventually it will end - and I do hope the folks who govern Hawaii realize that the Union Local 5 is important - but their tactics are really hurting the tourist industry and not earning any sympathy but instead disgust at the level of their tactics to intimidate and harass at the expense of others health and well-being.

However, that was the night of 10/11/18 – 10/12/18. When I got home, I was doing the math and realized that I was charged an additional night. So I tried calling the Marriott customer service line, but their phones kept hanging up on me when they would put me on hold. A couple days of trying later, I finally was able to stay on the phone for the 2 hours it needed to get a case made for me. THEN I was told that it will be 3-5 business days and I will have a decision emailed to me. That was 10/29/18. Since I hadn’t heard anything, I called back, was put on hold so they could verify this issue with the hotel, then the phones cut me off again. I still have no resolution to this issue. I have spent countless hours now trying to bring this to a close, to no avail. I understand mistake happen, but it shouldn’t take this long to make it right.

However, from the moment we stepped in the taxi we were warned of the impending situation at what should have been a dream hotel stay. I completely understand that unions felt the need to take their case to the streets, however what I didnt' understand is that the Marriott chain could not inform us prior, giving us the option to stay at a full service hotel, given that is what we paid for. If this was any other industry you would have to provide a refund as we paid for services that were never provided. We complained to 'corporate' which has fallen on deaf ears. Really disappointed at the lack of compassion for the guests like myself that did not sign up this.

I'm only staying at the Moana Surfrider when I come back to Hawaii. The hotel was gorgeous, the views were remarkable, and the staff incredibly friendly and top notch. To deliver the service and friendliness we received while such a large portion of the staff was on strike, was incredible. Yes, there was a strike during our stay, but the staff reached out well in advance to advise us and to enable us to make the decision to rebook if we wanted. And this isn't affecting just Moana, it's affecting a half-dozen hotels in the area. It's all of downtown Waikiki that is experiencing this. We decided against rebooking because nothing compares to Moana and went into the experience knowing they'd be understaffed. Given this, I was so pleasantly surprised. The management has done an excellent job quickly restaffing so there was no shortage in services and the new people were trained in a way I didn't any realize they had just started. If anything, be MAD AT MARRIOTT corp, not the people who live their life to create magical experiences for their guests.One manager in particular, Joo Ah Ige, went above and beyond to make my friend and feel like we were royalty. It was incredible! Our room and the view was BREATH-TAKING.And regarding the strike, they started and stopped at the same time each day. If anything, it was quite respectful so we were able to plan our day around it if it bothered us. And really, it didn't.

She forgot to give us a Lei, but did catch up with us as we were going up the steps to give us one. Deflated by the lack of Aloha in our greeting.Our initial room was street front.. lucky us!

It isn’t simply about the staff protest that was occurring at the time, but the way the hotel and Marriot handled it- not telling the truth and not giving any compensation for it. I had heard that there were protests occurring and called ahead 3 days before our arrival. I was told there was absolutely no issue and that no one was aware of a protest. I would have stayed elsewhere had I been told of the actual situation. (Turns our the strike has been going on for two days already from when I called)Upon arrival there was no one at the front desk or anywhere to be found. After wandering around the hotel for 10 minutes I finally found someone. We were checked into a standard room. In the hallways were cardboard boxes with toilet paper, shampoo, towels etc and big dumpster looking containers with dirty towels and trash cans for trash. Given the staff protest there was no maid service and you had to empty your own trash, towels, etc. Free breakfast was part of our package but all the restaurants were closed because of the strike. The protests began at 530am‘ with bullhorns and our room faced the street where the protest was occurring. I asked someone at the front desk if we could move to a room on the other side of the hotel. I was told that it would cost an extra $400 to do so even though there were rooms open. I spoke with the front desk and asked what level of compensation we would be given for this. The room cost 140,000 points for a two night stay (70,000 each night). The front desk originally offered 1500 points back. So the hotel was offering a 1% reduction in the cost of a room with no breakfast, no maid service, no restaurants, and a 530am wake up with a bullhorn. I said that it really didn’t sound fair and complained to the manager. I was told that I would be given 50,000 points back. Of course that has never happened. I have tried to call the hotel 5 times since our stay and have only been able to get through once (after over 20 minutes on hold on the phone). The one time I got through (the last time) I was told that I was lying and that no one would have ever offered me that. This was the single most disappointing, frustrating, insulting, and horrible hotel stay I have ever had. Being lied to from the start about the protest, to the actual service, but worst of all being offered 1% off, and then being told that I was lying about what the manager ended up agreeing to was really the worse part.

I booked a trip for myself and my husband for our anniversary and my husbands 40th birthday. I want to be fair in this review, as i like so many others have been put in a bad position due to the labour strike which has meant protesters have been out out there front of the hotel for several weeks now which quite frankly makes you not want to go near this hotel or any other on the strip , but it has meant that the lack of service has made this 5 star hotel feel like a no star hotel. I have stayed in the marriot servalTimes before in other locations , always with no hiccups and amazing service . The brakfaat nuggets as usually to die for in these hotels, however no knives one day and paper plates the next in addition to maybe a quarter of the breakfast buffet being servedOur room was never cleaned, there was an obvious lack of staff which made the place feel like a ghost town. However in fairness having never stayed here before I want to make a fair review do not withstanding no service or staff I will pretend this never happened.Pros- amazing location could not do better Beach access Beautiful outdoor area with great live music as night If there was someone at the bar the drinks looked good and reasonably priced Cute Cafe just outside owned by moana has A cafe with the best coffee on the island as far as we were concerned A big name hotel with a name you can trust Lovely check in counter people Cons- if you like me went over the website one hundred times thinking , $500 AUD minimum and weighed up the fact that the Rooms look small and dated, this was certainly the case for the banyan wing. Our room was tiny with our little one year old but we couldn't afford a bigger room. It does smell a bit of mildew as others have said. If we stay again we want to try one of the more expensive rooms to see if we like them more.","Sydney, Australia","kayebean</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",15,4.0

We stayed in two different rooms, as we were given the honeymoon suite for the nights before and of our wedding. The normal rooms are quite small, but beautiful and clean. The bed was also great. If you can afford it, treat yourself to the honeymoon suite or a similar room in the tower. The view was AMAZING and the room was large and very nice. Unfortunately, the strikes started 3 days before our trip ended. Despite the hotel's best efforts this was very disruptive. Obviously not their fault and they discounted our resort fee as a result.

Also, the building’s lobby is gorgeous and fantastic for pictures.Front Desk Staff - The front desk staff were quite helpful and polite. Cons:Rooms - Our room smelled of mildew for the entire trip as well as the hallways. Check-In process - We were told at check in because we didn’t book direct with the hotel that they are no longer honoring king bed requests, and king beds are only available to customers booking direct. We were then told we could upgrade our room for an extra $275 USD per night to a room type that wasn’t sold out and had a king bed. After escalation, this was resolved and we were placed into the original room type and bed type we had reserved. Housekeeping - On two occasions housekeeping came into our room without knocking at precisely 8 am. After the first incident we kept the deadbolt locked, this at least prevented the housekeeper from walking into our room and forced them to knock to enter. On our second day of the trip, housekeeping removed all of the caffeinated coffee and teas from our room and replaced with decaf which was really disappointing as well.

We stayed at the Moana Surfrider. It is a beautiful place to stay with a long history. The staff are first rate and attend to you every need. The Hotel is immaculate and beautiful. It Is located right on the main drag of Waikiki so everything is within walking distance. The beautiful beach of Waikiki is located directly behind you only steps away from the Hotel. There is a small pool located outside adjacent to the beach area. There are plenty of seating areas where you can just sit and enjoy the Ocean breeze. The rooms ( one bedroom for two) are rather small ( more like a New York Studio) the bathroom was really small ( only one will fit in there at a time) with your basic shower, sink, toilet ( with built in Bidet). The room view we had was of the main street and the rooms do not have balconies. I would suggest getting a room with the ocean view. The room did have a small refrigerator, one cup coffee maker and TV, I will tell you that everything there is very very very expensive for example if you wanted a ""Continental Breakfast"" in your room it was $32 so that gives you an idea of what the food and drinks cost. As far as as the room services I cannot tell you about that because as soon as we arrived ALL OF THE HOTEL STAFF WAS ON STRIKE. So our beds never got made or serviced, we had to exchange all of our own bath towels and get all of our necessities at the main floors. But the place is still beautiful and location is great and the staff that did attend to us was exceptional. So if you want to splurge its worth the money. As far as food and drink go you can find plenty of cool local spots with really great food and drink for reasonable prices within easy walking distance.","Long Beach, California, Usa","Sammyvelvet</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Beach, California, Usa</strong>",51,4.0

Finally got to the point where I could afford it and of course! employees were striking. Now, while I totally respect an individuals right to strike unfavorable and unjust working conditions I DO have a problem with them making racket on the beachside from sunup to 10PM. I’ve been told the breakfast at the beach house on the veranda is divine, but due to the strike was unable to experience it:(. We were in town for the ADA 2018, thankfully we had an idea of the strike prior due to the ADA sending out emails to notify attendees. Many others I spoke with had no idea until they arrived. People usually vacation at a place like this with the expectation of being pampered. There were absolutely zero services, no restaurants, extremely limited bar service (meaning you get up and obtain), no housekeeping, breakfast with plastic utensils (doesn’t seem environmentally responsible) and a lot of temporary staff (who were trying their best). I am disappointed in the executives who make decisions. Why were they trying to hide the strike from their clients? Shady..... it was very inconvenient to have to explore outside the hotel to eat every single meal. It was definitely not relaxing hearing bullhorns, cymbals and chanting all day long. I felt sorry for all the weddings we saw at the resort during this time, I can’t even imagine. The hallways looked like a war zone and you could fetch your own towels/toiletries from the front desk.We left on Oct 22nd. If you do stay here during the strike be sure to ask for a reduction in your rate as you’re NOT receiving what you’re paying for. In conclusion, this isn’t JUST an Oahu problem. The problem exists in every major metropolitan city in America, people working hard every day without the ability to afford *decent* (not mansions) housing for themselves and families.

This was a huge distraction; with 24 hour a day loud protests at the hotel entrance that spilled over to the beach on several occasions.All of the on-site Restaurants and bars were closed. Housekeeping was very limited, and the hotel definitely suffered from a cleanliness standpoint. HOWEVER.... the management staff onsite as well as staffers brought in from other properties on the US mainland worked tirelessly to do everything in their power to make the stay as perfect as possible under these conditions. They Are to be commended for their efforts; likely working long hours and dealing with a lot more complaints than positive feedback. I feel like the only thing the hotel truly did wrong was not notify guests in advance of a pending strike (which certainly would have caused some cancellations; but likely resulted in fewer upset guests).This was a big miss on their part!With that said..... WE LOVE THIS HOTEL!!! The check-in process was seamless; likely in large part due to my Platinum Status with the hotel. The staff did give us a lovely upgrade that truly ranked as one of the 5 nicest rooms I've stayed at in my many years of travel for business and pleasure. The Beach Club lounge had a lovely breakfast spread, and light dinner each night; and was staffed with likely very tired but very friendly folks. (some were hotel management, some were brought in from the outside)Yes, we were disappointed not to get to have dinner on the lovely veranda, or cocktails at the beach front bar. (that was actually our biggest bummer, since we booked this hotel specifically to spend more time at their exquisite beach front bar which we loved so much last time; it was under construction and closed off in a manner that blocked the view of the beach from the otherwise pleasant courtyard)Still; We LOVED this hotel. How can you not? Its grand, yet not stuffy. The rooms are fantastic; the vibe is old Hawaii mixed with a dose of old Hollywood charm. So we had to make our own bed and get our own towels; big deal!

I can only imagine how wonderful it would be with full amenities and full staff and hope that we might be able to some day return and experience that as well. Thank you to all the staff for everything you did to make our 35th Anniversary vacation a memorable one! You were all great!",,Judy C,1,5.0

The hotel is centrally located and you can feel the history just being there. We were upgraded but the room was really small which we can live with but little things were missing. The concierge desk needs some help. We asked for recommendations for dinner one night and the gal on the desk could not make any suggestions. On another day were purchased tickets for a bus tour. Again we were given incomplete information on how to us the vouchers provided by the hotel so ended up having to go out of our way to get the required documentation. We asked the front desk for s late check out (we are gold members of Starwood) only to be told that our request could not be confirmed until the day of departure because ""this is a really busy hotel"". When we made the same request to a different person the next day we were given the late checkout. The poolside bar is great and service really to notch.

This hotel is nicer than the other hotels we have stayed at previously in Waikiki but still leaves a lot to be desired. The pool area is small with limited chairs. If you aren’t out early it’s hard to get a spot. Also the service at the pool left a lot to be desired, no waiters ever came over. Had to get up and order food, then bring back ourselves. This was all before the strike happened.The day we were leaving the hotel staff went on strike. At 6 am you got woke up from hearing the chanting and screaming. We had valeted our car for our stay and when we went to pick it up, they told us we had to get it ourselves. I’m 5 months pregnant and we had to drag our bags to the car.We were fortunate we were leaving the first day of the strike but they significantly limited services. Going forward housekeeping and other basic services were not being offered.I support the staff for doing what they need to do but the hotel management did nothing to makeup for the fact that the services being paid for and expected were not being delivered. I also felt badly for those staff who were working filling in for jobs they normally don’t do, the IT guy getting bags, the spa lady handing out pool towels and taking the brunt of the angry guests. The hotel management and owners made no offers to guests on reducing rates or any sort of concession to guests to make up for lack of services. Shame on the senior management and owners of the hotel for not handling the guest situation better. People are on holidays and this is not what they are expecting when they book vacation at what is supposed to be one of the best hotels in Waikiki. I also emailed the general manager about how we were not satisfied on the last day of our stay as we were not getting services paid for. It’s been 4 days now and I have yet to hear back.

This was our third visit and each time I submit a review and the same recommendations fall on deaf ears. It is insulting to the reviewer and paying guest to receive the same tired, insincere response from the hotel manager or his/her representative. Apologies and promises of chats at the next meeting are not what’s needed- action is what’s needed.Firstly-the pool area needs attention- not quite sure how this worked. Days went by with lounges, tables and chairs reserved for special guests. Sometimes these guests did not arrive till midday- sometimes not at all. The pool area was filthy- every single day of our ten night stay. Tables were sticky and dirty. Food residue was still under lounges from days before. Pool service for purchase of drinks/snacks was non existent. Secondly-prices per stay are very expensive -add to that the local tax imposed by the hotel and it makes for an exorbitant stay. The Moana no longer provides shower gel and body lotion- these are standard at every other Starwood hotel we have stayed at. Here you have to contact Housekeeping every day (because that’s how they operate) and ask for these basic hotel toiletries. Cheap motels offer these as standard.Thirdly- The Concierge situation is a joke. Staff allocated to this position during our stay were not knowledgeable and fumbled their way through any inquiry we had- in the end we made do without this poor service.Fourthly- when we arrived the bellboys/valets were too busy chatting to notice our arrival in a taxi and we went through carrying our own bags and without the leis they traditionally hand out to welcome guests.These are just some of the cons of this place. These things need action- not more talk and promises. Guests pay a premium and surely the Starwood name carries a responsibility to provide guests with a special experience and not rely solely on the fact that the Moana Surfrider is the Grande Damme of Waikiki.

The experience started as soon as we got to the valet - flower leis, cold water, a warm welcome; we started living our Aloha right then and there. Then you walk into an amazing lobby - we were blown away at how stately the hotel was, the online pictures did not do justice. There was a bit of a mix up with the rooms (thanks to Hawaiian airlines booking our trip through a third party) but Irene at the front desk did everything she could to accommodate us, including letting us view multiple rooms to decide which one would better suit us. We ultimately decided on an ocean view room in the Banyan wing which, while cozy, was perfect for staring out and the clear, blue the ocean while taking our morning coffee or listening to the sound of the waves crash while falling asleep under the glow of the moon.Everything is immaculate and the service from either the front desk to the waitstaff, the valets and the bellmen, even the gift shop was top notch.

You will find absolutely no recognition of your SPG (now Marriott) status. This appears to be endemic to Westin chain hotels. I have never, ever once been upgraded. Also forget about preference like high floor or no connecting door being honored. The least I expected for 4 nights at 500.00/ night ( when charged a ridiculous resort fee) was something higher than the 9th floor in the category I booked. The standard response is ""sorry we sold out of everything"". The LA clippers happened to be staying here along with all the entourages and hangers on, so that may be the case. So word to travelers check your dates before booking and ask if a basketball team is staying as you definitely won't get any upgrade for sure. The room was tired and very being. The view of a rotting old building next door and a tiny sliver of ocean. This Westin is super cheap in their stocking of toiletries. Do not expect body wash or soap unless you ask for it. For managements part they are unresponsive and just smile with stupid stares. This happened at 1130 pm when the room next door decided to have what sounded like a furniture moving party and yelling match heard clearly through the connecting door I didn't want.

We loved the fact the Moana was right in the heart of Honolulu and we easily walked to many fab restaurants and all the shops. The pool seems a bit small for the amount of guests staying within the hotel, but they have a very fair system of allowing first come first served a bed, but if that bed is left unoccupied for longer than an hour it is made available to someone else. Beach beds are not included in the price, they have to rented out, but once rented, they are available to you all day at a cost of $55 a day, so allow this in your budget. it does stop the whole 'putting' your towel down and keeping a bed which you so often find in Europe.

It’s about as close to an oceanfront boutique hotel vibe as we could find in the city.-beach club provided great breakfasts and happy hours-Banyon tree is super cool-location to shops was excellent Cons: -resort fee is WAY too high and doesn’t include anything I wouldn’t already receive. This should not be charged to platinum guests.-refrig didn’t work in room -parking was too high ($30 per night, not included in resort fee) -pool too small & therefor too Crowded for hotel -the beach area was also too small & too crowded for hotel -bummed we couldn’t see the ocean! As a platinum elite Starwood /Marriott Guest, it was disappointing to see how many ocean front and ocean view rooms exist and they couldn’t find even ONE for 2 nights for me. I don’t think they should call the tower partial ocean views as an upgrade from anything - as I can’t imagine a lower category. If you can’t see even a sliver of the ocean from the living spaces of the room sans one chair in a corner (ie; we had to go onto balcony, and look to the left to see ocean), it shouldn’t count as a view. I don’t like laying in bed looking at another hotel’s balconies. The royal Hawaii is almost next door and then the Sheraton next to that.

I've been a visitor to Honolulu for more than 30 years - just keep going back because there's no reason not to love and enjoy it. Sure, Waikiki and it's resort hotels can appear a bit 'lost in the 70's', but it's more about the weather, the beaches, the cocktails ...and convertible Mustangs :-) Having said that, in those 30+ years, I've also travelled the world for business and pleasure. My reviews on this site are my personal and unbiased views.In all my visits to Oahu, I've always dreamt of enjoying the charm and delights of the Moana Surfrider, having stayed next door at the Outrigger Waikiki multiple times, along the beach at the Royal Hawaiian, Hyatt Place and so on - this was the one beachfront hotel I wanted to enjoy.So, to celebrate a 'milestone birthday', why wouldn't it make sense to fork out more than AUD1,000.00 per night for a beautiful tower beachfront suite at the Moana Surfrider??OK - does that set the scene !!!Yes, the beautiful and historic original building that opened as Hawaii's first hotel in 1910 is stunning - the Raffles of the Pacific. The opulent driveway, entrance and foyer, concierge etc is like stepping back in time to grandeur and royalty. Then again I already knew that having seen it's facade many times.If only that same look and feel and everything else could be continued into the guest suites. Very sadly - it's not.Yes, the Waikiki beach views all the way to Diamond Head and beyond as well as to the east take your breath away. But a 30 sqm suite with a bathroom that has not had an upgrade since the 50's, save for a new remote control whizz bang 'bidet' that would have limited patronage, just shows how out of touch the general accommodation market is in Honolulu. I guess it's because people like me keep going back, they don't think they have to change anything!!Then there was the delightful 'paper' coffee cups - which once used were only replaced upon tracking down the cleaning staff to ask for more. And after all 3 original tea bags were used - do you think they might have been replaced over the course of a week - nuh ..... sadly not.Now, did I mention the cost of Suite 1292 was in excess of AUD1,000.00pn - yes, I think I did.The other side of the coin is - well no one travels to Hawaii to sit in a hotel Suite. True - but when celebrating a milestone birthday and wanting to chill in luxury, I'm expecting just a tad more than a 3 star motel service - irrespective of how damn good the views might be.Anyway, I've already conveyed my feelings and comments to The Westin Moana Surfrider management and they were ever so gracious in apologising and offering me a small refund in compensation. Yes I am an SPG (Starwood Preferred Guest) member.I think I should stop here - except, let me say the beach bar under the largest banyan tree most people are likely to see in their entire lives is wonderful, as is the 1910 bar for an evening cocktail and The Verandah restaurant is classy and stylish, with the food (for Hawaii and USA standards) more than reasonable in price.Unfortunately the pool is a bit like the suites - tired, small, cramped and over run by kids - so if it's a beautiful pool you are seeking - not here.Now, I probably need a 'disclaimer' - because it saddens me to think that such a stunning property can fall so short in so many fundamental areas. And I think I know a thing or two about this also - being a part owner of a tropical absolute beachfront resort in Far North Queensland.Yes - Moana Surfrider location is tops, so are the original historic buildings. Staff are obliging, but I wouldn't say personable. Shopping and dining experiences along Kalakaua Ave abound. The transformed International Market Place opposite offers relaxed and fun shopping as well as half a dozen rooftop level restaurants that are all very well worth trying.So - if you haven't fallen asleep yet reading this manuscript - that's a wrap !!","St Kilda, Australia","Neil P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St Kilda, Australia</strong>",24,3.0

The carpet dried over the next day or two.The bathroom while a god size was tired and filthy. The top of the tiles behind the toilet were covered in dust as were the tiles under the towel rails.The saving grace were the beds and pillows. I don’t know what it is about 5 star resorts and there beds and pillows but they seem to find the best. The pillows were full and were like sleeping on clouds while the bed was just right.The Moana Surfrider charges a resort fee of about $50.00 AU a day and what you get for your money is still a mystery to me. The pool area is small so if you are not at the pool by about 9.00 am in the morning you have no chance of getting a lounge chair by the pool. Now this is where my biggest issue arises. As there is a very small pool area the resort has several lounges on the beach. Fantastic I thought. I don’t really mind whether I sit by the pool or on the beach. But no. To sit on the beach lounges you have to pay. What do you mean I have to pay says me? They expected me to pay $50.00AU for I/2 to hire a banana lounge and umbrella. What a joke! How is it my problem that you do not have enough lounges to meet your guests needs. If you visit several of the other 5 Star Resorts along the beach you will see that they have more than enough lounges to meet guests needs. I understand that land is at a premium but you could at least not charge for the lounges.The pool area bar is being updated which is fine and I appreciate that facilities need to be maintained so a temporary bar is in place. I also understand that glass is not the appropriate material to use around a pool but to deliver $25.00 AU cocktails in 10c AU plastic glasses is abhorrent. The cheap plastic glasses are inappropriate for a 5 Star Resort to serve drinks in. We drank out at several other beach/pool resort bars and while the drinks were also served in plastic glasses these were of a much higher quality and were reusable (unlike the Moana Surfrider glasses) therefore having less impact on the environment. The Moana Surfrider used paper straws but cheap plastic, disposable cups so where is the sense in that.To say I was disappointed is an understatement. For me staying at the Surfrider was a bit like hoping to see a famous, glamorous movie star and then realizing that the picture on their Facebook Profile was taken more than 70 years ago and they look nothing like what you expected. The front and facade is amazing but when you take a closer look you start to see all the flaws. I think it’s time the hotel had a closer look at what it provides and what the expectations are. The resort fee needs to be looked at and the charging for lounges on the beach is ridiculous.I would not consider the Moana Surfrider as my choice of accommodation if I was to stay in Waikiki again. I think there are much better options that would provide better facilities and cleaner, more updated rooms.

I truly hope that the General Manager of the property reads it and that changes are made, because it would be a shame to lose this history gem known as ""The Queen of Waikiki"" which dates back to 1901 and when opened was and for many decades after acted as the ""anchor"" of the Waikiki Beach/Honolulu tourist industry.I title this review ""They Don't Know What They Want To Be"" based upon my observation that the ownership/management seems more concerned with being a wedding venue than a 5-star Grand Dame resort hotel.Service is... spotty. Goes from highs to lows. The young lady who checked us in was wonderful in the sense that she upgraded us to a room (3704) with a fantastic view, a small balcony, two rocking chairs, and a bathroom with a combination toilet/bidet.Our room was small... but... comfortable... and again the view was to die for. Small but upscale. No complaints other than that the remote control for the bidet function (think a TV remote control) was screwed in to it's holder (which in turn was screwed into the wall) so that one can't get at the water/seat temperature controls which are on the REVERSE side of the control unit from the jet pressure and direction controls. We had to have a member of the engineering staff come up to unscrew the remote control from the way so we could use it.Also... MINOR complaint... (but, again; we're talking a 5-star hotel; there should be no minor complaints)... the alarm clock was set to the wrong time and after playing with it for five minutes yet being able to reset the time I was forced to call housekeeping.Oh... last ""gimmick"" comment... they give you an IPad for your room. I don't want an IPad. I just want a phone with separate direct call buttons for operator, front desk, concierge, housekeeping, dining, etc. An IPad is impersonal; I stay at 5-star properties because I'm looking for INDIVIDUAL personal service - from human beings.HERE'S THE KILLER, THOUGH... and sadly... unless the policy is changed I will never return nor will I recommend to the property to others: THEIR POOL CLOSES AT 6:00 PM.Let me repeat that: A 5-star resort hotel on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu Hawaii... and they CLOSE the pool to guest use at 6:00 pm.This isn't simply unacceptable; this is downright crazy! Not only is this a HUGE disservice to guests with small children for whom the pool is a safe ""family time"" zone, but I know that my wife and I aren't the only folks who like to take evening dips in a perfectly heated pool... perhaps before heading out to dinner... perhaps after getting back from dinner... perhaps right before retiring for the evening.I have NEVER in my life seen anything like this! One of the staff opined that management didn't want noise from the pool ""disturbing"" dinners because outdoor seating was in part close by the pool. My reply was to simply install a noise barrier. In any event, the ""solution"" of CLOSING the pool each afternoon (BEFORE SUNSET) at 6:00 pm and throwing both the children and the adult guest out... not a decision I can accept. Again, if this is how it's going to remain, they'll never have me or my wife or our extended family stay at the Surfrider again.Oh... and I truly do HATE to have to report this... but it's the truth. On our first FULL day/night there when we used the pool (by the way, we had arrived the afternoon before - Sunday, Sept. 9 - to find the pool CLOSED altogether at approximately 5:00 pm due to... contamination... found in the water) we couldn't help by notice that the pool area - the pool chairs, tables, under the chairs and tables - was strewn with rubbish, uncleared plates and used utensils, empty cans and bottles not disposed of...You just CAN'T have this at a 5-star hotel.For added context, this was our FIRST trip to the Hawaiian Islands - celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary in fact. We had started in Maui, staying at the Hyatt Regency Resort and Spa for four nights; moved on to the Hilton Waikoloa Village on the Big Island for three nights; next on to the Grand Hyatt Resort and Spa on Kauai; and the Moana Surfrider on Oahu was our last stop and the only true 5-star property. Sadly, I'd have to say that both Hyatts impressed us far more than this 5-star Westin property.No lais upon check-in. No bottle of sparkling wine for the room. Not even a drink voucher. While I DO appreciate the room upgrade... every single other property we stayed out on the other islands made us feel extra special in that we were in Hawaii for the first time celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary. The Surfider largely lacked the ""Aloha Spirit"" we'd been accustomed to on the other islands.Buffet breakfasts were very nice... ambiance was pleasant... food very good... service very good...The concierge staff was... not as enthusiastic, helpful, and welcoming as we're used to. The photo service staff... focused more on selling packages than on making folks like us who just wanted our one ""souvenir photo"" (which is INCLUDED with the mandatory resort fee) feel welcome.The pool staff had absolutely NO sympathy for the children - and their parents... and the other adults - disappointed by being told we all need to vacate the pool at 6:00 pm.Though we didn't have a vehicle in Oahu the valet staff WERE friendly and helpful and quick with walking directions when asked.This hotel COULD be SO much better than it is. Again... I hope that the General Manager reads this review and takes it to heart. As for those of you considering booking at the Surfrider... I've done my best to give you the good and the bad and you have other folks' reviews to go on as well.",Harriman (Orange County) New York,"William B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Harriman (Orange County) New York</strong>",108,3.0

It is known as a 5-Star hotel and it came with high recommendations. I didn't mind paying the absolute high-prices thinking we were going to have a 5-Star experience.WRONG!First of all, the pool closes at 6 p.m. so if you want to be able to have a drink and a dip in the pool in the evening, think again.After we checked in, went up to our rooms, refreshed and needed to get some dinner. Went down to the hotel's restaurant and was told very rudely that we couldn't dine there without reservations. Another night we sat at the Beach Bar and had a good drink, but the service was super slow even though there weren't many other patrons there.The room was the most disappointing. We had the ""Historic Banyan"" room which is one of only a few with a balcony. Sounded quaint. WRONG again. The walls are so paper thin that all we heard was the street noise, sirens, street acts, horns, etc. Definitely not a ""paradise"" vacation. We stuck it out the first night but didn't sleep well. The next day after a morning of beach fun, we wanted to take a nap before our dinner plans. However, there were protestors marching outside and with the paper thin walls, a nap was not going to happen. I spoke with the customer service and asked to be put in a quieter room. They obliged, the new room was in the back, much quieter with a nice ocean view, no balcony. However... the bathroom ceiling was leaking and there was a pool of water on the bathroom floor. For $300+/night - this hotel is not worth it!!!",,Nicole M,3,1.0

My opinion soon changed when finding that the lift wasn’t working and the room we was in was tiny for the amount of money I paid for it. The decor is dated, the net curtain came off on one side and the bathroom door was hanging on one hinge. Be used for seeing weddings in here because they have an average of 8 per day and reception is full of grooms and photographers.The main hotel service was always friendly but I wouldn’t recommend the complementary photo session as they take the most lousy shots and you cannot pick your own best photo out of the bunch! So why bother at all. The staff in the bar by the restaurant really need to perk up as the mood seems that showing a smile is really left to others. From staying at a few hotels in Honolulu I must say was the most expensive and disappointing. Waikiki is really Tokyo by the beach and you need to have plenty of cash and tolerance to have fun here.

The valet and desk staff are friendly and helpful. Our room was upgraded, free of charge, to a balcony room overlooking the pool and Banyan tree. We received a free beach tote, also. Get a room in the historical section, or just don't bother paying the steep price to stay here. The other sections of the hotel are more typical and modern, so you'd miss the ambiance. Rooms on the second floor are larger, or so I was told. The beds are piled high with heavenly linens and plush pillows, the towels, robes, and slippers are soft. The bathrooms contain rainfall shower heads and luxe toiletries, even lavender oil to place by your bed to lull you to sleep.

One woman showed everything she had when drying herself after swimming. Relayed this to management and their response was “ yes, we know, but it’s a public beach”.The pool was closed for a day because it was so dirty, when they did reopen it my kids eyes were so sore, I guess too much chlorine was added I had to give them some pain killers and wash them in the shower. I did mention this to the pool staff who weren’t bothered.The hotel is extremely busy, also lots and lots of wedding on on a daily basis so you are trying to avoid photographers within the hotel. Therefore they have the market and obviously believe they don’t need to try.We had a 7 night stay here and the end couldn’t come sooner!We were expecting better.

The charm, however, is considerably diminished by the constant throngs that crowd these settings from morning to evening, giving it more the vibe of convention center than a luxury beach resort. The word ""luxury"" is in general misplaced in regard to this hotel, as it is for virtually all Waikiki properties, regardless of price-- with one very notable exception that shows it is possible to have a refuge of beauty, peace, and luxury in the midst of the concrete jungle of Waikiki. While that exception, the Halekulani, is considerably more expensive than the Moana Surfrider, you get quite a lot for the price differential. After all, paying $500 per night for a partial ocean view room at the Moana Surfrider is not cheap. What is cheap,however, is the way the rooms are furnished, the amenities provided, and the breakfast buffet. My room was large, to be sure, but apart from size just outfitted for mass tourism ready to pay to be on the beach at massively overcrowded Waikiki and ready to settle for service and treatment no better than at one of the much cheaper Outrigger hotels. One would expect more from a Westin beach resort property, but this is sadly a characteristic of Waikiki that most hotels seem to assume they don't need to do much for their guests to achieve high occupancy rates. All in all, this hotel is fine if you don't mind the overcrowded lobby and facilities, and if you want to be in the vibrant heart of Waikiki shopping, restaurants, bars and crowds. The location is also ideal for going to surf or take surf lessons at the most popular Waikiki breaks, like Canoes and Queens. If what you are looking for is the real beauty, relaxation, and experience of the most these wonderful islands have to offer, then neither Waikiki nor the Moana Surfrider are for you.","San Francisco, California","David C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",14,3.0

If you can definitely request Diamond head side of the tower.We had the most relaxing fun family vacation ever!You do have to get up early to get lounges at the pool but that was no problem with the time change. I woke up early everyday happy to wander down to the club room for some coffee and fresh croissant with fresh made pineapple or grave jam then grab a spot by the pool.The beach out front is just great and the kids spent endless hours playing in the surf.You can buy fun inflatables and anything you might need at the ABC store across the street. The hotel has a air compressor set up by the pool so you can inflate your floaters.(Careful very powerful compressor heard one or two pop daily).I do think having gold or platinum SPG status makes a big difference at these types of resorts.

Yes, it took a while to get the car each time but since we expected this, we just planned accordingly and relaxed in the rocking chairs and watched the Honolulu life as we waited.

It is at best a schizophrenic experience at this hotel. First, the location is perfect — right in the thick of things. The service is all over the place at this hotel — some of the staff is over-the-top amazing and others are mediocre at best. The banyan rooms are small but quaint and have character while the tower rooms are much bigger but are definitely showing their age and in a dire need of an update. The bathroom is old and small with a horrible tub with a shower attachment wand that is horribly placed making you literally rub your naked body against the shower wall to stand under the water. Painfully small bathrooms to boot.The service was what was very disappointing. It started with the breathy whispering Asian operator whose voice was laughably quiet and incomprehensible. No one ever answered the phones with 10-15 rings and often you got no answer at all on the phones. Housekeeping was atrocious. During our five days there they came every day around 8:15-8:30 - a tad early for a resort property. They rarely replaced all of the shampoo and body wash but unexplainably left two-three new conditioners every day and I am bald! Even though my profile asks for extra towels and I reminded them again at check in — they were never brought without having to call and then Housekeeping tried to insist that dropping off towels would consist of our housekeeping service and they would not return to clean the room or make the beds. Every time towels were delivered, they were covered with long black hairs.When I checked in they informed me my welcome amenity would be some Hawaiian shortbread or I could get 500 extra points and I asked gift the shortbread. It never came nor did I receive the points. No upgrade was available for my checkin as a platinum member. I had to literally plead for a late check out which after a 15 min hold was finally granted. There is a nice sized lounge for platinum members which was nice. The breakfast was just mediocre and very limited. Often the food was ice cold and it is the first buffet in Hawaii that I have been told they do not serve pineapple on the weekends! What????The beach is lovely but staff was not helpful at all. No umbrellas or assistance. No beach equipment or toys. (We had to run to Ross for discount beach toys!). Staff did not leave the towel stand. The pool is dreadfully small and overcrowded mostly with young screaming children. Another overpriced money grab by the hotel by charging an exorbitant resort fee with no benefit in return. This seems to be the norm at resorts now and they seem to give you less and less in return for the price and really makes the hotel stay less than ideal. An additional $150 in fees for nothing in return is uncalled for during this stay.The hospitality rooms to freshen up in before the flight were a very nice touch and earns them an extra star!There was NO place on property to get food at 9:30 pm on the Sunday. The pool bar and hotel restaurant were both closed and the room service was not available after 9:30. Ended up ordering a pizza. The hotel which was once grand is now a money-grubbing, fading star of a property that doesn’t seem to care about their property or their customers.I probably will not return.

I'm sure commercial pressures over the years have forced the various owners to sell the property to the highest bidder but I just feel that the commercialism of the Westin group has taken from the charm of the place and probably not lived up to what Mr Peacock had in mind all those years ago.Now the Westin is all about making money and they are very successful at it and I get that but in my opinion they have overstepped the commerciality line to the detriment of this grand old lady (others may argue that they saved it but isn't that the beauty of free speech in this magnificent country of yours)To the specifics of my issues. Last February we booked two rooms for myself and my family for a July vacation. It was for our 25th Wedding Anniversary which my travel agent advised the hotel of! Upon arrival they separated the family on floors 12 and 5! They had 5 months notice that we were coming and still could not hold two rooms on the same floor (commerciality but not family centric!). Not even a little hand written card to congratulate us on our anniversary and to thank us for choosing the grand old lady of Waikiki to celebrate it.(commerciality but not terribly Hawaiian of them).No bell hop on arrival, 23 hour flight from Ireland and you can take your own bags up to the 12th floor stopping off on the 5th floor to dump off your kids (renowned Hawaiian hospitality I don't think so!) I wrote to the GM while staying there to express my annoyance at the family separation but of course this was ignored. Why would the GM want to engage we me? Sent a second email to a ""champion"" at the Westin group and got a reply saying someone would be back to me within 5 business days (commerciality at its best but not customer focussed). Anyhow got some diatribe email about no ""guarantee of connecting rooms blah blah blah.. and basically it was my travel agents fault to which I responded with a few more observations but that was completely ignored which seems now to be the policy of the Moran's Surfrider a Westin Resort management team... just ignore and it will go away. I say be careful of what you wish for! Anyhow that my review over, people can make up their own minds but I don't think I'd return until the Westin group change their attitude.Ps I did have an excellent experience with the lost and found department who located my missing iPad and posted it to my next destination.","Dunboyne, Ireland","CluckerJones</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dunboyne, Ireland</strong>",73,2.0

We stayed in the diamond wing in a oceanfront king bed room. It was a really small room and smaller bathroom. It is the older wing but its nicely renovated/modern. Lucky for us we don’t need much space. But two of us couldn’t be in the bathroom at the same time and they had no counter to put your toiletries on. The view we had was great but it was on the 2nd floor so we can hear everyone outside. We witnessed two weddings outside our room and couldnt sleep one night from the loud music they were playing. The restaurants on site were great and the location was really convenient for shopping and walking around town. The beach is right out front, BUT, we went to beach services at 9am and they were already sold out of beach chairs and cabanas for the day. Their pool is too tiny to even use... so we had to walk to the hotel next door and luckily they had beach chairs and umbrellas we count rent for 50 bucks from 12-5pm. It was a bummer to see Moana couldn’t accomodate even a third of their hotel guests when it came to lounging on the beach. Also you cant take any food or drinks out onto the beach which kinda sucks. I got too spoiled in Mexico having pina coladas right on the sand. Also they are supposed to give you leis when you arrive. We never got any and only recieved some when we mentioned it as we were leaving :/ Kind of a bummer. If I stay here again, I would prefer the bigger modern rooms in the tower wing, and now i know to reserve beach cabanas like a week in advance.

The room was nicely decorated and met all of our needs. The view was of the street but I’m glad. I was able to see when the action was happening. There was WiFi throughout the property.

This hotel had one thing going for it, it's historical value, and that is all. Rundown exterior in back, rooms are tiny, sink is the size of something you'd expect to see on a fishing boat. Music in the courtyard plays pretty much from 5pm-1030pm every night. This is fine, except those nights you are exhausted and just want to go to bed early and get a good nights rest. Floors and walls are thin. Was kept up every night by the people above us moving around. Not crazy moving around either to warrant us calling front desk. Pool is tiny and beach is over crowded with people that aren't even staying at the hotel. Hotel seems to cater to weddings when we were there. Hotel staff could have been friendlier and more welcoming upon arrival. Housekeeping and maintenance guys were very friendly. My biggest disappointment was getting food poisoning from the Beach Bar chicken wings, which I'm 100% certain about. Had them at 830pm by 1am I was vomiting uncontrollably for several hours as well as on and off the following day. I stayed in my room all day long, which was a bummer bc my girlfriend and I paid to rent an umbrella and 2 lawn chairs $55 by beach. She went out for a couple hours bc I made her, so she didn't need to take care of me. Upon check out I explained to management what had happened and simply asked if they could just remove the $55 charge(umbrella chair rental) for me, seeing as their food caused me to lose a whole day of my vacation(and wasn't fully recovered for about 48hrs) Not a crazy request, right? I didn't want to make a big deal out of it and thought that was a reasonable ask. Managements response was I needed to talk to security and file a claim and have them investigate it! Said, ""my health was of their upmost importance and this is why I needed to go that route."" Basically, we don't believe you. Needless to say, I was checking out and didn't have time for all that. I wish I did, bc I was extremely insulted by the way I was treated. You're a 4 star hotel and I'm paying 400 plus a night, not trying to rip you off, just simply asking the $55 charge be removed from my bill out of the principle of the matter and show of respect and sincere apologies for your kitchens screw up. Extremely disappointed and ruined my day how it was handled. Finished off our vacation at Westin in Maui and it was 10x's better in all aspects and was run like a top notch hotel.

We found the Vintage 1901 alfresco terrace bar at the historic Banyan Tree courtyard to be better than the Beach Bar as it served a wider range of food and cocktails (and without the plastic cups that are used at the Beach Bar).We had all-day daily access to the Beachclub “club” lounge (with a view over the pool and beach) which served a simple but good continental breakfast with a few hot dishes, and free flow of house wine and beer in the evening. Beachside, there are 4 private beach cabanas which can be booked the day before, at USD 110 for a full day with towels, water and waiter service which we booked on a few days as they have great views and easy beach and pool access. Also worth a mention is the free WiFi hotspot which is included in the daily resort fee and gives unlimited WiFi access on Oahu. This saved on our expensive Australian telco roaming rates and was useful to post photos of our awesome vacation activities while on the move.On our last day as our Tower Wing room was unavailable for a late checkout, reception were great and gave us use of a Cody but charming city view room for the day.We can’t thank the friendly and helpful hotel staff enough for making this our most memorable and relaxing holiday ever and we look forward to a return visit.

Your choice would be to put your towels on the ground until a chair hopefully opened up or to spend $55 for beach chair and umbrella or $110 for one of the four cabanas. So much for the resort fee. We did spring for the cabana on one day and it was a great experience. The hotel needs to find a way to increase the number of free chairs and/or decrease the fees for beach chairs and cabanas.A nice touch are the rocking chairs on the front and rear porches which give you a chance to relax and watch the world go by.A very good hotel to sat at.

It didn’t disappoint. The front of building is a bit Southern plantation painted white with rocking chairs on the verandah & Hamptons. As you walk in you get the view uyou want, Waikiki beach through the doors opening out to an old Banyan tree. You sit under the tree during the day sipping on coffee and in the evening with a cocktail & light snacks all day, whilst listening to a guitarist. The back of the building has a veranda as well reserved for breakfast and restaurant dining, but make sure to reserve the verandah for breakfast otherwise you don’t get the lovely elevated view over the sea, but still nice on the ground level.The beach is only a few steps from the hotel with crystal clear water. The surf breaks much further out, lovely to see the long boards.Our room was perfect, on the 6th floor with Diamond Head volcano view. I always find it useful to call the hotel reception to discuss which room. It was always going to be in the Ocean Tower, a long building jutting out towards the sea and the tallest of the 3 accommodation wings. But if you look closely every second balcony has a grill which you can see through to the glistening surf & Diamond Head. The other rooms though have a solid concrete balcony approx 3 feet high with small grill. This impedes the view if sitting in your suite or lying in bed. I definitely wanted the grill balcony and the Diamond head view and it was fabulous. The Westin quality was there with divine beds, pillow requests, etc.The other wings include the original building called Banyan rooms. No balconies but views out to the sea I assume from most rooms. The Diamond wing is a building on the other side of the original hotel and all balconies face directly out to the ocean. Views to Diamond head but you need to look out over the balcony to the left. The charm is in the lobby, restaurant and outdoor areas. We met a couple staying at the Royal Hawaiian, the pink palace. They told us the Moana had a lot more charm & next time they would stay there. There are reciprocal rights to charge back to Moana Surfrider from the other Starwood properties, Royal Hawaiian & Sheraton.Located in the lovely area of Kalakaua Ave with designer stores, I still managed to find the Nordstrom Rack outlets. All types of food catered for in the surrounding area.Highly recommend and can’t wait to return.A little late in reviewing, the hotel just sparkled as it was Thanksgiving week 2017.

There was a huge fully furnished balcony leading off from this.The view was expansive from both balconies, right out over the sea, beach area ,city. Must be one of the best views in Waikiki.The Executive Lounge was well worth the price paid. Good breakfasts with plenty of choice, plenty of tables and cheerful service. Open all day for coffee and basic snacks, and then pre dinner drinks and canapés in the evening for a couple of hours. Outside area too. We found the restaurant expensive, but with very good food, enjoyed everything we ate there.

There are also two tower buildings added in the 1960s that have balconies. Older portion had a smaller room, but we were looking out on the side opposite the Banyan Tree (hotel is in a ""U"" shape with the ends facing Waikiki Beach and a Banyan Tree in the middle. Our view was a little quieter.Arrival included a lei greeting and help from bell staff. Parking at the Sheraton Princess Hotel for $35 daily self park and $45 daily for valet. Just a block walk away. Very comfortable bed and the room was clean. Very busy with guests and several weddings per day. Evening had live music in the lobby (pianist). Highly recommend the sunrise greeting activity on Wednesday mornings at 5:15am. Yes, that is like WAY early especially for vacation, but DO IT! We didn't get up for it, but met the staff member who does it during the historical tour of the Moana Surfrider Hotel (Monday and Wednesday at 11am) and decided that we wanted to do it. We participated in the same ceremony on Friday morning at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel (next door) and it was AMAZING, even though it almost made us late for our flight!Waikiki Beach is beautiful and quite famous, but it is narrower than I thought it would be but still nice.

Sadly this is not reflected in the services.We got off to a poor start when we were told we had been given a king bed. As we are sisters we are well past sharing a bed but were told adamantly and repeatedly there was nothing else available. I asked to see the manager and, miraculously, the desk clerk reappeared to say the manager had found a room with two beds!Our room was spacious and comfortable but the only place to hang clothes was in the bathroom close to the toilet, a strange arrangement we have not encountered before.We asked the concierge where the best bar was to get a martini and he indicated the beach bar which was outside and more casual and noisy than we wanted. He was then at a loss despite two bars being visible from his desk. So we wandered round until a restaurant staff member showed us where we could sit and order a martini. However that was our last one as the prices are eye-watering and with the daily charge (a disgraceful add-on after you have paid for your accommodation) and the exorbitant prices throughout the hotel, we found cheaper alternatives in the nearby International Market and nearby.The beach is busy but it's a great place for a swim and beats the small pool. My advanced age meant the only way I could get in was at the end with the steps which was roped off for kids so I had to swim under the barrier to get to the deeper end, not a satisfactory set-up. We were pleased breakfast was included but avoided the chafing dishes as the food in them was either unappealingly cold or dangerously tepid. But there were a good selection of lovely fresh fruit, an excellent miso soup, plenty of salad stuff and thick slices of smoked salmon. The coffee was awful and we had to ask for hot coffee or else it was cold as well as tasteless. Some days water glasses arrived and some days they did not, emblematic of the generally slapdash service.The worst aspect of breakfast was having to queue. One morning I counted over 60 people waiting and most days there were more than 20. Staff dealt with the queue very slowly and it is an annoying start to the day.We were also disappointed with the general cleanliness and atmosphere. While our rooms were kept clean and the room staff were polite and cheerful, we were never greeted by any other staff and there was a level of grubbiness I have never seen in a good hotel before, like a large ice-cream splodge that stayed on the lift door all day,I think this hotel needs a good shake-up. It's fine to charge high prices but then you have to deliver to match the cost and this place is run more like the average motel than a first-rate hotel.","Hamilton, New Zealand","Bea962</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hamilton, New Zealand</strong>",54,3.0

We had water bottles replaced every day , this is included in the price . Pool area is so busy , be quick if you want to get a lounge chair . We have had to get to the pool area around 7.30/8am in the morning to get the Lounges . Many guests were leaving there towels / bags etc on the lounges and going to have breakfast. This was not policed enough by pool staff . The pool side cafe was expensive and the staff member lacked charisma. The older lady working behind the counter did not smile or show any enthusiasm towards guests . A real lack of customer service , this has been a general theme throughout the hotel .

Very little to choose from .I had a interesting moment at the beach bar where a staff member was rude and offensive, not only to me but to my 12 year old daughter . Management were notified , I hope it wasn’t just lip service they gave to me .

You might picture this place in the Southern Belt of the U.S.Upon arriving the first thing you notice is the traffic. This hotel is located in the middle of all the action on Waikiki beach. This could be good or bad for others. It's very loud and you hear the street noise from your room, even if you are ocean facing as we were. Upon arrival the bell staff and front desk were terrific. Upon receiving our room key, we found the rooms to be average at best, but certainly not for the price we paid.The hotel is very pricey. Rooms, drinks and food. The pool area is small and old, something you would never expect in a fancy hotel. For others that don't care, you have a beautiful ocean at your doorstep, however it is very crowded with people, surf boards and catamarans landing on the beach front. Watch your children closely. In the afternoon there is live music which was nice and again the service all around was terrific.After paying $28 dollars for bacon and eggs the first day, we explored this hotel chains sister resort two doors down. You can charge food and drinks to your original hotel when visiting sister properties. Here I paid $18 for the same meal. Multiple pools, same great beach and afternoon entertainment. We will be back to the second resort.At night there are hundreds of places to eat and the shopping nearby is a mix of casual to the worlds most expensive brand stores. Pro's: Location, hotel staffCon's: Expensive food and drinks, average room decor, very loud property, small outdated pool, difficult to get a lounge chairOverall we were disappointed for the price we paid for this trip. The pictures all look nice, but my recommendation would be the neighbor property ""The Sheraton"", both SPG properties.","Valencia, CA, United States","vpvalencia</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Valencia, CA, United States</strong>",22,3.0

The views were stunning. Shawn, a Concierge, was great to deal with; helpful and kind. Janet in the breakfast restaurant was lovely; a consummate professional. Cocktails served by the pool were very good, and Eric was a friendly and cheery server. We had a good room service dinner on our first night at Moana. Housekeeping was excellent.However, considering we were paying $760 a night (without breakfast) there were a few areas of service that could be improved upon. I spoke with a manager called Shane about them, who said they’d be discussed at the next day’s management meeting. I once again ran into one issue I’d raised with him a few days later. There is an escalator leading to the day spa. Whilst there’s a lift that can take guests up there and they can be let in via the back door, a bizarre atttude among some staff of wheelchair bound guests use only seemed to prevail! On my second visit to the spa on Saturday (the afternoon before our leaving) I took the lift to the spa and buzzed the Phone to be let in the back way. All was well. A pleasant employee admitted me. Upon leaving when I said I’d be taking the lift, a recalcitrant staff member told me I’d have to take the escalator. I repeated that I would like to take the lift. She stared me down and said that I couldn’t! I told her I had left via the lift on the last occasion and all she had to do was to open the back door. She gave me a filthy look and grudgingly opened the back doorway for me. Frustrating and poor customer service given that I already raised the issue with a Manager a few days earlier.","Perth, Australia","Lizziebackcourse</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",94,4.0

The hotel , it’s garden for drinking and eating , and it’s new next door modern tower , have a sort of low dividing wall along the sand , then sand for 15-20 metres and then the Pacific Ocean till Australia . Lookout for tsunamis, as our Hawaiian hosts said . The nature of the old hotel has been preserved beautifully with stained wood , Venetian windows and deck chairs along the balconies .A seamless joint to the newer tower provides service desks , escalators , a shopping arcade and lifts , ballrooms etc .The reservations desk appears to have a max of 6 positions so how they cope for a Jumbo load of Asian guests escapes me .Our little party of 20 late afternoon mid week was handled easily . Signs at the lifts of the tower advise against use if there was a fire . You nearly die of old age waiting for one in normal times . Somehow the guests manage to fit into the beer garden but the trick is to send a scout in advance to secure a table .The queue for breakfast , at any hour , allows you to stand there and finish the local paper . It is handled electronically by a screen that guides the receptionist to source a waiter to escort you to your table ., ONCE one becomes vacant .The forward scout trick works again as you can secure a large table even you present alone . Due to the popularity of the hotel with Asian guests , very little of the breakfast caters for Anglo Saxons but I am sure that the hotel can adapt at a second’s notice to it’s coming patronage . The staff are efficient and helpful but nowhere as laid back as our first stop . Twenty times busier too though . After Westin Hapuna the tower room was a come down, half the size and with a bathroom the size of my wife’s shoe box , as she scornfully informed me . Toilet tucked in a tight corner , shower over a tiny bath , no good if you are arthritic , and with a basin top big enough for 3 glasses , two lipsticks , some deodorant and a small soap . My wife , whom I spoil , gives it a 3 out of 10 compared to Hapuna .However , we are talking PRIME real estate here and every inch counts .It certainly is situated on the main drag , with a Tesla shop over the road , Rolex , top fashion shops , etc. all top dollar .How you fit a Tesla car in your duty free carry on I am not sure .The other great shop over the road is the ABC supermarket and gift shop . Alcohol at prices to make an Aussie cry , and every sort of souvenir you may wish .Also , if you feel like a cut sandwich with cheese and ham , egg salad or turkey etc to eat on your balcony , they have little cheap plastic packs of them .The hotel also has an ice machine near the lifts , something every hotel should have to cool your cheap drinks . I forgot to mention that the Hapuna does NOT have machines , just an ice bucket in each room filled by the housemaid , usually midday or later . Melts away quickly in this climate anyway .I carry a plastic ice tray cut down in length to fit in the usual small bar fridge in most rooms , if the fridge has an ice compartment . Meals in the garden were fine in choice and price over the few days we stayed there . My wife gives 10 to the garden and bar atmosphere , and a 10 to the weather , compared to our freezing back home .All the hotels seem to fit into a strip of four streets parallel to the beach , with a canal running behind . Local houses start the other side . Not sure if the long wide canal is there to drain away inland water or protect the locals from the tourists .Maybe vice versa . Anyway , if you are being picked up to go to the airport , expect a long tour around 5 to ten hotels if your lift turns up in a twenty seater mini bus .Allow plenty of time also for getting THROUGH check in , security and the 5 kilometres walk , so it seemed , to the boarding gate if you are flying Qantas. Right at the end of the buildings . A 7.30am hotel departure just makes 10.30 am flight .The locals are genuinely scared of tsunamis and one Government official lecturing us raised the possibility of a giant tsunami coming over from the Big Island in about an hour if the fault line along the front of the currently erupting Kilauea volcano , with it’s line of 23 or so crevices along it’s front , decided to let a 20 kilometres or so long part of the mountain slip down into the ocean facing Honolulu.No more Honolulu , but unlikely .","Canberra, Australia","paulocon2016</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",10,4.0

When we asked to be moved to a room with a better ocean view, Noy took the time to look through many room options to find the one that suited our desires best. Additionally, when I informed him of my husband’s passion for a particular amenity they offer he gave us an extra special treat that made our vacation especially memorable. All the hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were very clean. The Toto toilet seats were a nice surprise. The fact that the resort sits right on the beach was especially delightful. Live music in the oceanfront bar was enjoyable.

We were early to check-in and our room wasn’t ready yet. To add onto that, they were claiming they didn’t have any double bed rooms available, so my mom and I were going to have to stay together in a king bed (even though we had requested two beds weeks prior). We were not impressed so asked to speak with the manager. He conveniently found us a room with two beds thank goodness. The room itself was huge and had both a city view and a side beach view which was amazing.The property itself was lovely. The Beach Bar in the middle of the grounds was beautiful at night and the food there was pretty good (albeit pricey). In fact, everything was pricey. The cocktails, a regular American breakfast, even ice cream, was way overpriced, but hey, that’s Hawaii I guess. Like others, I didn’t like the system for the limited number of pool and beach chairs. I tried to book the beach chairs in advance of our stay because we only had one night there, but no such luck. When I arrived, they were already booked. One morning, I woke up early and waited in a line to get two lounges by the pool. Not how I want to be spending my vacation to be honest. Also, the chairs weren’t particularly luxurious or clean.Back to our room- while it was huge and lovely, it was incredibly noisy. You could absolutely hear the street noise, including the early morning garbage truck visits. If you are sensitive to sound, I would stay way from city view rooms! The most hilarious thing about the room was the remote-controlled toilet. My mom and I had a good laugh about it!Final things to say- you can’t beat the location. I stayed at a hotel a little bit further away from the beach and I didn’t enjoy it as much. Waikiki Beach gets incredibly crowded but its beautiful. As for things to do other than suntanning, there were a bunch of restaurants in the area including the usual Cheesecake Factory etc. but I personally had a hard time finding good breakfast food options. I ended up visiting the Maui Brewing Company across the street and had an excellent eggs benny. The hotel is situated right on the main strip so lots of shopping as well.Despite some the negatives, I would likely still stay here again but now I know what to expect and can plan accordingly.

Everyone from the front desk, to waiters at the Beachouse and Beachbar to the housekeeping to the pool staff care about your stay being a happy one. They all make the extra effort so your stay will be enjoyable. A good example of this was on our last day, the staff managed to give us a late check out so we didn’t have to sit around at the airport and could enjoy the beach and tropical weather. Another example is the staff who do the tour, morning sunrise greeting, lei making, bracelet weaving and yoga instructor - each and everyone of them is welcoming, friendly and helpful.Yes, of course the hotel is beautiful, well maintained and takes you back to a simpler time of afternoon tea and relaxed dining under the beloved banyan tree while listening to musicians who relax you to the tunes of Hawaiian medleys but it is the true aloha spirit that makes your stay magical and unforgettable.The Moana Surfrider is everything you want your vacation to be; fun, relaxing and memorable.

This is not uncommon at Hawaiian resort hotels; however it was frustrating that there were no instructions (from a staff person or from a sign or handout) that could explain how to reserve, or the price, etc.Resort fees were around $35, and parking is $45 per night. In that neighborhood, I'm not sure how someone would park their car on their own.In general, this was a beautiful hotel, and it's very nice to be in Hawaii.

You can't beat the location as it is positioned perfectly on the beautiful beach of Waikiki and also right in the heart of all the amazing shopping and restaurants. You get the beach vibe and the busy city experience all in one. The outdoor setting is spectacular and I loved the live music daily. My favorite thing to do was just sit at one of the tables outside at sunset while listening to the live music and sipping a cocktail. Truly what I want in a beach vacation. It's also a great place to take a surf lesson or catamaran cruise because they are right in front of the resort. I would recommend it more for couples and adults. It is not geared towards children, which I liked. However, others may wish there was a larger pool and more children's activities.

The Diamond Lawn is so beautiful facing the ocean, but with hedges that were high enough to block out the many people lying down and walking on the beach. The ballroom was the perfect for our guest count, and is a beautiful intimate location away from the daily hotel foot traffic, with a foyer area to host cocktail hour.

We were even greeted with chocolate covered strawberries and a bottle of champagne upon our arrival to the room. The suite was clean, spacious, and had a fantastic view of the ocean from the balcony. It was the perfect space for me and my bridesmaids to get ready in.The day of the wedding couldn't have been more perfect. Our catering manager was around on the day of the wedding to make sure everything was progressing smoothly and that the catering staff was taking care of us.

At reception you wait for ages to get served and once you end up getting to the front of the line the lack of friendly service awaits you, the reception staff are very transactional and at no time did any of the staff ask how our stay was gong and and check out no mention of how was your stay or any thing nice - just would you like the charges to be charged to the credit card on file - what a lasting memory!!Pool SideThe lack of staff around the pool made it very difficult to order food or drinks - so many times we just had to go and order at the bar but in the end it was just easier to go outside and bring back a nice salad or sandwich from the many options outside the hotel at a much higher quality. Another frustrating element of the pool food and beverage is that very time your food order arrived ended up with no cutlery and napkins and then had to wait again whilst your food goes cold. The pool side area is never cleaned in the evening with sand everywhere - one would expect the entire pool area is cleaned nightly - it is not.The pool attendants looking after the towels and cabana bookings were the only friendly team throughout the entire hotel - the rest need to go to service training or retire!!Food and Beverage Overall food and beverage quality very poor. Poolside food lacked quality and consistency and always delivered without cutlery and napkins - food better described as something you would get from a cheap takeaway like IHOP but at a premium price.We had dinner at the Beachhouse - what a disappointment. The hotel talks up the chefs and the food, whilst the food was OK not worth it for what you pay by any means to to be honest the dinner we had the previous evening at the Yard House was far superior and the service far far friendlier and more efficient. Again another example of a lack of staff in this outlet and then the male staff member who served us was very transactional - not sincere and gruff! We expected much more but it is clear this hotel restaurant survives on tourists who dine 1 night only - they would not survive in a normal competitive environment. The beach front garden bar is filthy - I encourage the management to take a close look at the bar , the Mould under the beer taps as a start. Look at the ceiling in the bar with the dirt and cobwebs. All drinks are served in cheap plastic take away cups and cheap cocktail mixers are used - Similar to those used on cruise ships.Whilst the location is wonderful sitting under the big tree looking to the ocean surrounded by the historic building - again similar to the Beachhouse restaurant , the bar only survives due to its location and not because of great service and quality innovative beverages. Very unfriendly bar staff.The leased out cafe at the front of the Hotel served great coffee and breakfast items - nice staff and great coffee - can highly recommend.RoomsRooms are getting tired and old and need a refurbishment. Our room was not particularly clean - for the premium price and being a Westin we expect better.Housekeeping go though the motions of the bare minimum. Soaps, body wash and cups not always replenished daily - another example of inconsistent service.Cleanliness The place is not clean - whilst I get it that this place is busy very day there is no round the clock cleaning and maintenance program in place. This place falls very short of the expectations of a brand such as Westin.In summary this Hotel survives because of its location and the historic wing of the building, the poor service levels and lack of cleanliness and maintenance would not be accepted in other parts of the world. You never see any senior management present around the hotel and maybe this is part of the problem.Would we come back - probably not and during our stay we visited a number of other hotels in the same area that we will consider for our next stay.This place deserves better and let’s hope our feedback is taken constructively and improvements can be made to the benefit of future guests.","Bangkok, Thailand","travellingisus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong>",28,2.0

The hotel is located on a great sandy part of Waikiki Beach. There is an area on the second floor with a small Museum documenting local and hotel history. There are limited hours that presentations are given. Hotel guests can enjoy comfy chairs on the second floor balcony that provides fresh air to watch the street below unnoticed. Shopping at the larger chain stores and a variety of restaurants are within easy walking distance. We booked a Historic Banyon Room, Street View. However, a private balcony was very important to us and they are not available for many of the Banyon rooms. You cannot book one, you can only request it. After phoning a couple times to make sure my request was noted on my reservation, I did receive one with an Ocean View. There are VERY few in the historic section, and I think they might all have Ocean Views. The Historic rooms are small but we were still able to have a roll-away although it did leave us kinda cramped and would not be an option for a lengthy stay. Very clean property.

Clearly despite the price we love the hotel it’s like a second home. Now you would think that regular repeat guests(11 of us) would have no problem getting the rooms we wanted when booking many months ahead?Well we discover that because we book through an Australian travel agent we don’t get the same benefit as people who book direct with the hotel. We wanted all rooms on same floor with at least two adjoining in diamond deluxe oceanfront. This has been the same on each occasion we have stayed. These were the requests given to our travel agent and reception. Reception advised no instructions had been acted on by them as they only preferenced direct bookings and gave no value to ‘third party bookings’. (Thru travel agents) WE WERE SHOCKED. The hotel did organise adjoining rooms on a different floor the next day but we had to move out early and the new rooms were unavailable for 5 hours later. Hotel didn’t bend over to help. Oh btw we are spg members but that was not recorded with the booking or after checkin when our number was provided. So we missed out on those benefits.

We received either no information or incorrect information from the concierge and the reception desk on what I would consider to be basic information. They offer a 35% discount on some meals but NOBODY could explain the exceptions - not even the front desk supervisor. The biggest complaint I have is that after our supposed ""final"" bill was settled and I received verbal confirmation that this was the final total, additional charges were added to my Visa. I called the hotel when I returned home to get an explanation. I left my name and telephone number and all relevant information. Guess what? My phone call was never returned.

This year we decided to splash out and treat ourselves to a stay here. Sadly I was disappointed, it didn’t live up to my expectations. Although I am still glad we stayed I would look elsewhere in future. The good: the hotel is beautiful and all the public areas are well maintained and timelessly elegant. The location is probably the best in Waikiki but you have to pay extra for those views...worth upgrading to oceanfront room if that’s what you’re after. Rooms are clean and modern in the newer tower blocks. The bad: rooms are small and walls are paper thin, we could hear our neighbors conversations. Bathrooms are very small. Paper cups for your in room coffee (which leak!). No friendly traditional Hawaiian welcome on arrival which I’ve experienced at other more reasonably priced hotels. Tiny pool area - though forgivable seeing as you are literally on Waikiki beach. Very busy with non guests enjoying the public areas. Pricey ‘resort fee’ (though a standard thing on the islands it still annoys me to pay for things that should just be included as standard as you can’t ‘opt out’) This hotel still has enough charm to keep me loving it but the owners could be doing so much more for their guests. all the good points about this hotel - the banyan tree, rocking chairs on the veranda, the beach front bar, the lovely restaurant...are all public areas so why on earth would you pay the prices to stay here for a simply average experience... I love the surfrider for the old Hawaii it represents but perhaps Westin need to up their game in offering a service that matches this beautiful hotels charm.

You should know I am a frequent traveler staying in hotels upwards of 15 weeks a year. This trip was significant for myself and my wife as it was our first 7+ day trip in twenty-four (24) years with out our children. Let me first state that I cannot express enough how well run this Westin property is. Every (and I mean every) interaction we had with the staff from the bell staff, concierge, front desk, spa, wait-staff, pool staff, phone operators, cleaning staff, and bartenders was simply topnotch professional and courteous! It seemed every time we required assistance or guidance the staff at the Moana had the solution. More impressive yet was this hotel was extremely busy and sold-out during our entire stay. Yet you would have never known given the quick cheerful responses. We stayed in the Historical Wing, which was stunningly beautiful and well maintained. It is the perfect balance between early Victorian architecture and modern amenities. Our room was spacious and the view spectacular. Somehow our room was always cleaned without ever seeing the maid service. We would simply come back from going out to breakfast or spending time at the beach and the room was clean and replenished. The bell staff helped in many ways throughout the week. The pool staff was also very helpful and the bartenders were very pleasant. As an example, my wife and I had made a local reservation outside the hotel although missed it due to traffic driving back from the North Shore. I called the concierge desk and spoke with ""Shawn"". I explained this was supposed to be our anniversary dinner. Rather than connect me to the restaurant (Beachhouse) hostess, Shawn took the initiative to personally walk over and arrange a table for us. He was successful at getting us a table for two at sunset. Again the food and service was excellent and each server congratulated us on our anniversary. Throughout the days and evenings there was always wonderful live Hawaiian musicians playing under the banyan tree. This was soooo very soothing. We took some time to walk along the shoreline visiting a several other properties and I can tell you they all pale in comparison to the atmosphere you get underneath that amazing banyan tree at the Moana. On our last day we requested a late checkout as our flight did not leave until 8PM. The hotel was only able to give us an extra 2 hours as they were very busy. However, they offered us free 1 hour ""hospitatality room"" to shower and get ready. That way we were able to fully enjoy the hotel and beach for the lion share of the day and still freshen up prior to our departure. My sincere appreciation to the management and the staff for operating such a fine property. You should be all very proud of how well run the Moana Surfrider is.

Overall we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay, complete with friendly staff and a pleasant vibe in all areas of the hotel, including the downstairs lobby and rocking chairs on the veranda, where we sat to read and watch the world go by a few times due to rainy weather! The only thing stopping me giving this hotel a five star “excellent” rating is the price per room, for what you get. Although the rooms were clean and with exceptionally comfortable beds, they were on the small side, and when paying $500 plus a night, you do expect higher standard of room. For example our room overlooked a roof top and the street, and was very small, and although it must have been renovated at some point in recent years, it still felt a little tired. You definitely pay for hotel location in Waikiki! That being said, location it does have and we were pleased with our choice of hotel. ",,SimoneM09,28,4.0

Our ‘city view’ room ended up having a wonderful view of the sea. Our beds were so comfortable and we had the most wonderful stay. Just to be able to rock on the front verandah and eat under the Banyan Tree was a joy. Waking up early and going to the pool at 7 am to snag a sun lounge was a bit of a bummer but this is what happens in beach resorts. The daily resort charge seems like a rort but all of the major beachfront hotels charge this now. The character and beauty of the Surfrider is unparalleled in Waikiki.

My wife’s parents accompanied us on that trip, and despite having visited a number of wedding venues on Oahu, our conversations kept circling back to the Moana Surfrider. It’s such a beautiful hotel, right on Waikiki Beach and centrally located to virtually anything you could want to do in Honolulu, including high-end shopping and access to restaurants that fit almost any budget. My wife’s parents, and (later on) our guests, just loved being able to walk out of the hotel, go window shopping, find someplace to eat, come back to the hotel and then just lay on the beach or right beside the pool. In fact, we’ve had some guests who have been to Hawaii numerous times, on several different islands, and upon staying at the hotel, tell us afterward that the Moana Surfrider is their new go-to hotel of choice on Honolulu.Our event sales manager, Kelli Kajiwara, was the consummate professional. In planning the wedding from the mainland, there were a lot of phone calls and emails. Kelli's responses were prompt, well-thought-out, and extremely polite, warm and friendly. Naturally, in planning a big event such as a wedding, there’s a lot of back and forth in terms of balancing what we envisioned for our wedding versus what the hotel has established in terms of policies and procedures, but Kelli did a fantastic job navigating us through all of the considerations, and the concessions made on either side, felt like a win-win. On the day of our wedding, it just poured and poured. (We’ve been told this is considered an enormous blessing in Hawaiian culture.) Our ceremony was initially supposed to be outside on the Diamond Lawn & Terrace, but on account of the rain, the ceremony was moved upstairs to the Rooftop Garden room, which my wife and I were completely pleased with as a backup option. We had 88 guests, and while space was limited, it did not feel, at all, too cramped. Kelli and her team did an excellent job ensuring our guests made it to the right spot. Everything looked beautiful. Our reception was held in the Beachhouse, and with 88 guests, a full buffet, DJ table, cake table and photo booth, the space felt spacious, high-class, and certainly made a positive impression with our guests. Immediately following our wedding, and the days after that, we’ve had so guests tell us it’s one of the best weddings they’ve been to. Sure, some of our guests might just be flattering us. However, many of the comments came from individuals that we’ve known to be very blunt and tended not to sugarcoat their views. Some common themes that came up in discussions, post-wedding, were how everything felt, “beautiful,” “classy,” “magical,” and how “the attention to detail was phenomenal.” Guests told us how much they enjoyed the food. A few commented how, in their opinions, the food was, “the best wedding food they’ve ever had.” Others loved the flow and pacing of the ceremony and reception. Everything seemed to flow naturally from one thing to the next. We did not receive any comments regarding the staff from our guests, which I suppose is a good thing, but from what we observed, the staff appeared to be so warm and hospitable. My wife and I sincerely appreciated how attentive the hotel employees were to us and we loved being showered with so many congratulatory comments by the staff… it made our day feel extra special. All-in-all, Kelli and the entire Moana Surfrider staff were just fantastic. Even beyond our wedding day, the service at the hotel is impeccable. We’ve had so many great interactions, whether it be minute or substantial, the customer service at the hotel is top-notch. We look forward to coming back to the Moana Surfrider for many years to come.","San Francisco, California","Robert_1839</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",2,5.0

We had a room overlooking the beach and a partial Diamond Head view. The room had a balcony in the bedroom and living room and was nice to look out and see the water. Being on the third floor it was a bit noisy as the Outrigger Hotel was next door and had plenty of evening activities which we heard until 10pm. Our room came with access to the beach club which served its purpose. The Beach Club breakfast did not have an omelette station or eggs to order but there were other items to compensate for this. The pool is indeed quite small, but with the ocean just a few feet away, I felt there was no need for a gigantic pool. We did splurge and rented a cabana which was wonderful (albeit expensive). Tours: My wife and I enjoyed three excursions. We did Pearl Harbor, Polynesian Cultural Center Luau, and an ATV tour on Kualoa Ranch. They were all wonderful, but we highly recommend the luau, and Kualoa Ranch. We rented a car and drove to Dole Plantation. The ice cream was fabulous! We took the train ride and was quite surprised how much we enjoyed it. This was our first time to Hawaii and we will return.

On two occasions where I had questions regarding facilities etc I was given incorrect information.Weddings- a real nuisance, always in the way, we had to make our way to our room via an alternative route cause we were in the way of a bridal party and its professional photographer. Its all very well to sympathise and apologise that our expectations were not met. Most reviews complain about these very same things- this hotel is very expensive to stay at- do something about it- clean the pool furniture, inservice the staff and train them to be hospitable, alert and to provide excellent customer service, employ additional staff on the front desk and dont ever make guests feel second rate.",,72MJJ,5,4.0

I booked on points and put in request with my upgrade certificates which didn’t come through. I specifically picked the tower section since I like more modern accommodations. Upon check- in we were told we were upgraded. Well were we shocked when we walked into our room and literally banged the door on another piece of furniture when opening it. The room was a box. The smallest room I have ever been in and I travel all over Europe and NYC where I expect that. The bathroom even worse. You couldn’t keep door open and open shower door at same time. Seriously claustrophobic! They said ocean view. It’s a big window - no deck or patio like the room I booked and the windows are so dirty it seriously is best to keep shutters closed. And room was horribly hot even when on lowest temp. And the hallway smell - oh my. Hold your nostrils the minute you get off elevator. The resort lobby area and shops nice. Beach club access is nice for platinum but leaves a lot to be desired. One kind of white wine and beer. And very little variety all week for breakfast and evening snacks. What I will say is the staff in beach lounge was nicest on property. Especially Sheldon. Just wonderful. Remembered our names and orders. Not very sanitary though to allow birds in beach club to be picking at breads. Then the pool area. Very small. You can rent chairs for $55 a day but can’t order alcohol drinks from them. (Pretty ridiculous) and service was horrible. We had to find our server for everything except when she wanted us to pay check \ then she stood over you. Not really service. Photography service was very good. Restaurants overpriced and not worth it.

Despite some people's complaints about the Banyan Wing rooms I found them to be charming. The bed was extremely comfortable and while the rooms are small they have all the amenities you could need. We were on the 4th floor facing the city and despite others complained about the noise we had no issues and im a light sleeper. The staff on the other hand is not accommodating. At check and I had to spend 40 minutes bartering on whether or not I could get the two double beds that i had requested. After being offered a $517 upgrade to a tower room or a king with a rollaway (that i refused), they finally made the exception and gave me the two doubles I had requested. Completely unnecessary hassle after a long flight. My other major complaint was that one afternoon while waiting for the staff elevator (since the regular elevator was out of service) my poor mother with dementia was pushed past by an executive who was showing off the property to a couple. When I brought it to her attention in the elevator, she didn't even acknowledge that I was speaking to her.

Service is outstanding; everyone seems to take enormous pride in their work, and they are so friendly and helpful. The pool is small and closes early in the evening, but, as the pool attendant told me, “The big pool is open 24 hours”—meaning the lovely beach and ocean just steps away. For those who like to do their exercising inside, there is a sizable and well equipped fitness center, open all day and night. We had a cozy corner room on the third floor of the historic section, overlooking Kalakaua Avenue. The two large windows made the room sunny and bright in the daytime, and there was lots of activity to watch on the street below. But, at night, the street performers sounded like they were in our room, and the pretty plantation shutters were quite ineffective at darkening the room. If we had known what it would be like before we unpacked everything, we would have asked to be moved—it was a lesson for the next time!

Our experiences while at the hotel were average at best and echo what many other reviewers have said: overpriced everything, elevator out of service, very small pool area, expensive beach chair rentals, etc. My review focuses, however, on what happed after we checked out on the morning of December 8th. We went straight to the airport for our flight to Maui, then proceeded directly to our hotel there. While unpacking, I realized that I had left some clothing items behind in a drawer at the Moana Surfrider, and immediately phoned to get assistance with getting them back. No more than five hours had passed.Without getting into all the details, suffice it to say that no one would take my calls, return my calls, or cared in any way about my situation or about helping me. After repeated calls over several days demanding to speak to a manager, I finally received a call on December 11th from Stephen H., who, instead of offering help or an apology, exacerbated the situation by displaying an extremely defensive attitude and suggesting that perhaps (1) I actually still had my items and just didn't realize it or (2) that TSA had removed those exact belongings (the ones I had left in the drawer) from my bag on my flight to Maui. Basically he considered anything and everything, no matter how far-fetched, as a possible explanation, while dismissing the most obvious explanation, that the person who accessed the room after we departed took them. When I insisted on filing an official report, the Moana Surfrider basically just passed me off to their insurance company and wiped their hands of the situation. Needless to say, their insurance company, First Insurance Company of Hawaii, denied my claim. Now, unless I file a police report (which in hindsight I should have done) and hire a lawyer, I have no recourse.I NEVER would have expected to be treated so poorly by any hotel, let alone one that portrays itself as a 4-star resort. Do NOT be fooled - while you will be paying luxury hotel prices, you, your belongings, and your experience during your stay are meaningless to them.","Vancouver, Canada","valab65</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",7,1.0

On the beach side there’s table clothed restaurant; and a more casual dining spot; and a small bar. There’s also a stunning banyan tree that with changing colored lights for drama. Next to this there’s also a small pool, too small to accommodate the trove of guests staying at the hotel. Immediately after those eating venues is a small strip of beach, which is a common negative to most all of those grand Honolulu hotels set right on the beach. They do offer towels to guests for the beach, but the beach chairs cost $30/$35 a day to rent. The lounge chairs by the pool are free, and open up at 7:00 AM but for the 5 nights I stayed at this hotel, I was never lucky enough to get one, as they snapped up at 7:00 AM by people who left their towels on the chairs and went off to breakfast.

Would give it 4.5 stars. The staff were nice and they were helpful. Quite polite really. I did call to hospitality once from the room because they forgot something and the hospitality person showed up and probably two minutes so the service was very fast. I thought all the staff was extremely courteous. The bed was comfortable and the shower was nice in the room. The only thing I would fault this hotel for is the fact that the windows in the room must be from the year the hotel was built LOL I literally checked three times to see if the windows were open. That's how loud it is in the room. You can hear everything that goes on outside and I was on the third floor. However it does quiet and down and the area by about 11 p.m. so it's not bad for sleeping. I really don't love hotels that charge a resort fee I feel like it's just a bit of a nickel-and-diming that they do to their guests. The resort fee is just over $37 a day here. My problem with that is that you really don't get much for it. There aren't enough loungers the pool (pool is very small) and all the lounge chairs are taken by about 7 a.m. which is easy to.imagine because there are not a lot of them. Then if you want to go to the beach there are no chairs from the hotel on the beach. So if you want to sit on the beach you have to sit on your towel on the super crowded beach with the other millions of people. Not really my idea of a relaxing holiday. (there is no zen here). I saw some.other reviewers saying it is a great place to unwind...lol.....I'd really go looking for a quieter area to truly unwind! The Westin does have some chairs behind a little picket fence with sand under them and I was shocked to find out that they rent them to the guests. I find that kind of ridiculous when you pay a resort fee that you would then have to pay them to rent a chair with sand under the bottom of the chair ( kind of like you'd be on the beach). That's just wrong. I'm fairly well travelled and honestly....that's not right to do that to guests. What thought comes to mind = 'money grab '. It is my opinion that if you pay to stay at a decent hotel, and I think this hotel wants to feel like it is fairly decent place, then the least they can do when the hotel is on a beach it's provide every guest with a lounge chair for sitting on the beach. Because after all, that's why people are at the hotel, isn't it?However I did like the hotel...just pointing out some oddities. P.s. when it rains the (beach-bar) bar by the big tree is closed. Why don't they cover the area a bit better so guests have something to do besides hanging out in their rooms or in the lobby?","Guelph, Canada","J_travelB</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Guelph, Canada</strong>",255,4.0

I held a meeting in one of their parlor rooms and everything went off without a hitch. Aki and Bob were so friendly and professional. 2) I rented a car and used valet parking, which is by far the easier option and worth the extra money. The staff working the valet stand were consumate professionals; they remembered who I was in no time (I never had to give them my name when returning to the hotel), which was quite amazing since it's constantly busy there. For that, I bought them malasadas from Leonard's as a token of my appreciation. 3) The location cannot be beat. You walk out of the hotel grounds and you have everything right there in front of you.Cons: 1) I had a room facing the courtyard in the historic wing. I had a bit of an ocean view, but what I didn't anticipate was a live band on a Monday night. I understand very well that many of the hotel guests are there on vacation, but it was surprising to hear a live band on a weeknight. It ended around 10:30pm. 2) This one is more funny than a con, but my room had these very tall windows with a wood bench in front of it. There were these massive, male handprints on the very top of the window.

We won't be back. First off, we had reserved a non-ocean room. When we arrived, we were upgraded to one of the Banyan rooms in the old wing. It is very cute - ocean front, rocking chairs overlooking a Juliet balcony, and a great view of the wedding grounds. It is also very small, especially with two double beds. And don't get me started on the bathroom. My dorm bathroom was larger in college. Plus, it was definitely showing signs of wear and tear. To top it all off, the a/c was set not to go below a certain temperature, which meant the room was always a little warm. Combine that with the double bed and we didn't sleep well for three nights. And, if that wasn't enough, I think every bridal party traipsed through the hotel to have their photos taken, so you were always trying to sidestep brides, grooms, attendants and families. And because of the size of the hotel (and wedding parties) you couldn't get past them. This started at 6 am and went all day. And it isn't like there were a lot of weddings at the hotel - we only saw one wedding in three days and about 87 brides. Overall too busy, too crowded and too run down. Stay somewhere else for the money. I'm giving it three stars because the room was nice and the service at the bar was good.","Houston, Texas","chitex</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",11,3.0

Had read some mixed reviews on trip advisor so was a little apprehensive about what to expect. Checkin was a breeze. We were upgraded, with SPG gold did not expect that at such a busy hotel. We stayed in the historic wing, and while the room is smaller than the average hotel, we had a view of the courtyard and a slice of the ocean. The room was comfortable, well appointed and the water bottles and beach bag were an added bonus. The shower amenities were missing which was quickly remedied by the front desk. The first morning we ate breakfast at nearby local restaurant - and then immediately returned to the hotel and down to the beach. The hotel's courtyard overlooks the ocean and there are loungers owned by the hotel that can be rented. We discovered the Cabanas and ended up reserving one for the following day. Upon returning to our room we discovered an apology note and a box of chocolate (""sorry for the missing amenities) a pleasant surprise and a very nice touch. We had access to the lounge, the breakfast had a nice variety of choices, dinner was ok - would be nice to have a larger spread and less starchy or fried foods. This hotel gets a lot of foreigners and this lounge is lacking in spread diversity and options. Mid day snacks consisted of pretzels, nuts and popcorn, ok but Westin could improve in this area. We also noticed that a soda fountain was installed and plenty of water bottles were available. We did enjoy the fact that there is a terrace that faces the ocean a stones throw from where we sat. My favorite part is being SO close to the beach. On our 3rd day we were upgraded to an ocean view in the historic wing. WOW. The view was awesome, we slept with the window open so we could hear the ocean. Yes hotel windows that open. On our 4th morning we ate breakfast at the buffet. Food was fresh, there was something for everyone. The service at this hotel was attentive, friendly and the location is perfect for enjoying the beach.

Highly recommended!!Room: The view was amazing! The room wasn't huge - just a standard hotel room with two queen beds I believe. Balcony had two chairs as well. It was perfect for myself, my 13yo and my parents. No one had any issues at all. CLUB LOUNGE: Access to the beach club lounge saved me a TON of money. My family had breakfast there every morning and there was a great selection. Coffee and espresso, bottled water and pop was always available. There were several nights we didn't even go out to dinner as the food they had in the lounge was more then enough. The free wine was excellent. The ladies working in the lounge would constantly come around topping off your glass. All of them would strike up a conversation and provided excellent service. Was the highlight of our trip. I had a bunch of SPG Platinum employee thank-you certificates and gave all 10 of them to the ladies in the lounge. They made our stay. Loyalty Recognition: I booked an ocean view room because it was important to me to have a view. I see a lot of reviews of Platinum members complaining they didn't get an ocean view upgrade. If it's that important to you - pay for it. It's not guaranteed otherwise. I was lucky enough to get upgraded to a higher floor as well which i was very thankful for. There a ton of benefits for Platinum members which they tell you about (and give you a paper about) when you check-in. Discounts, lounge access, breakfast, etc. Overall: I can't say enough about this hotel.

Waikiki’s oldest hotel, opened in 1901. Even though the hotel is well maintained and fresh, I felt as though we had stepped back in time. We loved the old world feel, the decor, the sense of history. It really is a grand old lady. Sitting on the front verandah in the morning, watching Waikiki wake up is an experience we will never forget. Likewise, spending the evenings under the magnificent banyan tree, sipping mai tais and listening to great music made for some fond memories. It’s testament to how aesthetically beautiful the hotel is that we spent most of our time staring at it, all the while, the beautiful Waikiki beach was just behind us. The staff were efficient, but I wouldn’t say they were particularly personable, except for the breakfast waiters who were very attentive and kind. Our room was clean and well appointed, a little on the small side (compared to others we have stayed in). We only ate breakfast here, opting to utilise the many dining options in Waikiki. Breakfast was quite expensive, but then the servings were massive. Our only gripe was the daily “resort fee”. We found this a little hard to stomach given we paid a very high price to stay at the Moana. This $37.70 a day charge added a fair slug to an already expensive holiday, and then of course, the gratuities were on top of that. On balance, staying at the Moana was an unforgettable experience, and one we’re glad we can add to our adventures. Just beautiful.

We have been here for almost a week & it’s been like living on a building site. They drag trolleys around from 4.30am setting up for conferences & weddings, which is a daily occurrence. The house keeping staff make sure you are up bright and early, just what you want on a holiday. By 7.30am they are knocking on your door & vacuuming outside your room. The rooms are dirty & on several occasions they didn’t even attended to our sons room. Who knows what they are vacuuming! I must admit the sheer lack of service started from the moment we arrived. It was almost midnight when we pulled up outside, a family of 4 with 7 bags (been skiing first!) No help from the bell desk, in fact they just watched us drag our bags up the stairs until they eventually came when I fell down a step with a bag. On check in there wasn’t any “holiday” welcome. Didn’t get a lay, apparently you have to be a different nationality here to get any form of service. When we got to our room we were happy. Nice big bed, rooms are small but we could manage. Then on closer inspection there was dust & dirt over every surface. The toilet smelt like it hadn’t been cleaned in a very long time. Close to an hour later we still hadn’t gotten our bags. My youngest son is 12 & we were all in need of a shower & some sleep after traveling all day. In the end my husband had to go & track down our bags & literally beg to get them to our rooms. The beach chair arrangement is a joke, as well as a so called private beach which as guests you have to pay for. One pool attendant spent a morning chasing my sons around constantly telling them off. Accusing them of running & diving, which is completely untrue as we were watching them. I’m disgusted that they treated them in this way, they are paying guests after all, just because they are young westerners. We chose to sit on the free unattended beach after which is a much better option! We aren’t usually people who complain but we did bring these matters to the front desk to get absolutely nothing in response. They just looked through us, did not care at all.I would never recommend this hotel. Yes it’s very pretty from the outside & the lobby is quaint but that’s truly where it ends.

Before I booked the hotel I made the mistake of reading the most recent reviews here. You actually need to read reviews for the same time of year you are staying. A week before our stay I read some reviews that were mostly negative - complaints about the complete lack of free chairs around the pool and even lack of those you can hire on the beach. So I'd prepared myself for this headache on arrival. Only on our first morning did we have to queue at 7am to hire beach chairs at the hotel. (I believe this was much worse over the xmas-new year period) In fact, we found the public beach chairs you can hire next door to be much better - closer to the ocean and easier to find shade and they were available throughout the morning - no early rising to book them which kind of defeats the sleep-in enjoyment of a holiday. But I will say this: Australians have a pathological hatred for hidden fees. And whatever price the hotel quotes for the room (ours was pretty reasonable as we're SPG members) you must add on at least another $120 to include the mandatory resort fee, occupancy tax, room tax and beach chairs ($50). Then decide if you are prepared to pay this overall cost.The fact is, this hotel is the oldest in Waikiki. The pool was built many years later. The hotel capacity is about 1300 guests and I'm advised it's at capacity over the new year's period. 40 free pool chairs and another 26 pairs to hire ain't gonna cut it. So if you can avoid coming at this peak time - do!Otherwise, it's in a terrific position. We stayed in the Tower wing and the rooms were large, well-appointed and comfortable. We loved sitting in the rocking chairs on the front verandah and by the pool.

As we visited during peak holiday season, the problem was probably bigger than usually; a fact that one out of three lifts was not working did not help. Whenever you want to get up or down – prepare to wait.Then there is the breakfast queue. Starts forming already from 8 o’clock. It is not only lack of tables, but the system is designed for queuing. First you wait in line to register at the desk, then are moved to the next line waiting to be taken to the table. The problem is that to the historical hotel two huge wings have been added; now its lobby, courtyard an restaurant designed for the original wing must serve – 3? 5? – times as many guests and we could feel it all along. On the plus side: the breakfast buffet is very good, a nice beach just in the front (rather pricey sunbed rental). There is a good looking gym, but was too crowded when I checked, so ended up running along the waterfront instead. “Beachhouse” restaurant is pretty good, if you are lucky to get a table.This is a nice classic place turned a crowded resort – but I am not sure if there are better options on Waikiki beach. In any case, stay away during Christmas peak season.",,Lucja K,47,3.0

We arrived mid-morning after an overnight flight from Australia. There was only one person on the front desk and we waited in line for 30 minutes before being served. Even after discussing options for storing luggage and getting changed etc, the front desk person failed to tell us there is actually a “hospitality room” guests can use for 45minutes to shower and change / refresh. We found this out from the bell boy and then had to line up again to request to use the hospitality room. When we arrived at the hospitality room, the previous guests luggage was still inside, so I would strongly recommend taking your own luggage back to reception rather than relying on the hotel to keep luggage secure. Despite already pre-paying all costs (including the ‘resort fee’) the hotel still charged us the resort fee again, without first notifying us, we simply noticed the charge ourselves. The hotel charged us instantly, but took 3 days to refund the charge, and only after constant enquiries with front desk staff who were confused about the situation and dismissed us, stating they would “pass on the message to finance”. Although the hotel is beautiful and well located, it was not worth the cost and the service was very poor. We would not stay here again. Good points - Location on the main strip and also beachfront Great views from the room / balconyReliable wifi in the room Bad points - Really poor service from the front deskSmall pool and all pool chairs taken by 7amBeach bar had good food and service however it was always impossible to find a table.

First thing I saw from the balcony on day one was a turtle in the shallows on the beach below (Waikiki Beach!!) and this set the tone for the whole stay; great ambience in the hotel; rocking chairs, Banyan Tree, friendly staff. The million dollar question of course is was the extra cost of the suite (over US$1000 a night) over a room worth it? My answer is a guarded yes; in our case there were three adults and the alternative would have been two rooms; these would have cost about the same if you go ocean front; the view from the suites is fantastic and you do feel like you have he best spot in the whole of Waikiki as it sticks right out into the water. The other thing with the suites is you get Beach Club access; as other reviewers have noted this is fairly average in the morning (though staff very good), but comes alive in the evening with a nice vibe.Other than the view, the suites are not that special in terms of bathrooms etc but a good size and the day bed is great.Overall when we go back ( and we will, soon), as a couple I'd go for an oceanfront premium room rather than a suite and use the money saved in the Verandah bar and restaurant.Overall a great stay","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Fofofthehorn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",10,5.0

Overall our experience at the Surfrider was poor. Although the hotel needs some work, the biggest problem is their service:-One of the elevators for the tower rooms broke down the first day of our stay and it is still broken as of today. We did not see anyone working on it the entire time. This often resulted in long waits.-Pool drink/food service was lacking if you were not in a cabana. Most days we didn’t see any servers for the general pool area. We did luck out and had a young gentleman serve us one day. He was excellent (did not get his name). The other time that we got service we had to track down one of the ladies serving the cabanas. -The Beach Bar was also lacking service. On the night of the 24th I ended up having to clear off the table from the previous group. I brought the dirty dishes to the bar’s staging area and wiped off the table with a napkin from the washroom. We tried to go one other day for lunch but the waitress, after us waiting for 15 minutes for anyone to come by, told us the food would take an hour or more. We left the hotel to go for lunch elsewhere.-THE POOL!! This is an absolute joke. I know how the towel game works at these hotels so I am always up early to hold some chairs. The pool opens up at 7:00am. The first few days I came down around 6:30-6:45am. Most of the chairs were reserved by the hotel and what was leftover was mostly taken. Today I came down at 5:30am. The pool attendant had already started reserving chairs. I grabbed 4 chairs facing the ocean and he came over to tell me I couldn’t sit there as they were reserved. I showed him there was no reserved sign but he still asked me to leave. He put his reserved banner across the two chairs after I got up. He also told me if I wanted to hold other chairs I could not leave them until the pool opens at 7:00am! Here is the crazy part. I started looking around and the hotel had about 20/60 chairs reserved. These are the ideal spots that get most of the sun. Allegedly these chairs are reserved for those guests that have came back 10 years in a row (or more). Although I don’t agree with this special treatment, I can live with it. The issue is that these reserved chairs stayed unoccupied until about 8:45am (you can see the clock in my pictures). That is 1.75 after the pool opened. The hotel policy is that chairs can’t be left for more than an hour. Most of these reserved chairs ended up going to those guests that also complained about the special treatment. If you want to sit by the pool during your stay then look elsewhere. The pool is really small and the fact that the hotel is reserving 25-30% for special guests means you are likely not going to get a spot.

The hotel itself is beautiful and has history at every turn. The on site museum and memorabilia really takes you back to the glory days of early Honolulu. Staff were all pleasant and helpful, especially housekeeping and front desk. Our corner room was beautiful but on a scale we’ve only previously seen in Paris-it was tiny. The view however was spectacular facing the beach and Diamond Head. The pool area was v nice and relatively easy to get a lounger for the day with towels readily available. Food and beverage was also of a good standard. During the day the hotel is extremely busy with a never ending parade of tourists and weddings passing through. Also there is a very commercial side to the hotel with an unavoidable array of upsell opportunities from photos to cabanas to beach loungers etc. There’s a steep resort fee which includes an array of things but most of these are things I would expect to be provided anyway at this star rating and price point. All that said, we thoroughly enjoyed the people watching, the rockers on the porch and the coffee at the adjoining coffee shop and would stay again but would probably ask to see the room first as the size was off putting.

You can still sit in one of the classic rockers on the porch and watch the world go by. The hotel lobby is just as impressive and you'll be hard pressed to find a time when a bride isn't gracing the spectacular stairs while posing for pictures.

The pool is basically for kids and to splash in and cool down...don't expect laps ... the ocean has lots of space for that.

So we were pleased when we drove up to the Moana and walked into the beautiful entry way and finally felt some of the romance that we had been hoping for on our honeymoon. The hotel itself is beautiful, so much character! We had nothing but great experiences with the staff, and were very impressed with the room. The hotel was very clean and decorated so nicely for Christmas! Our favourite part was actually the location. So central to all the shopping, restaurants, and of course the beach so you can walk to anything you might need or want. The only tips I give future guests is always call for your car at least 20 mins before you need it from valet. They pick it up from another location so it takes a few mins but I recommend just waiting for it while you sit in the rocking chairs out front. Always a good spot to sit and people watch. Also as beautiful as this hotel is it is very busy and the very small pool is always full of kids and pool chairs are all full of towels people have left to save seats that apparently didn’t seem to be a problem with the hotel as it didn’t look like they made an effort to keep people from doing it. But Waikiki is such a busy place itself I guess we should have assumed it would be as busy as it was. After our trip we realized Hawaii is not a place we wish to return to. We enjoyed our time but it just wasn’t for us. We might try another island one day but for anyone visiting Waikiki be prepared it kinda feels a lot like the Vegas strip but instead of casinos it’s high end shopping everywhere you look. Be sure to rent a car so you can go explore other parts of the island some really good little places to eat towards the North Shore.

We normally stay at the Modern however decided on the Moana Surfrider for a change. What a huge disappointment this hotel stay was. The location and a pretty tree is the only thing going for this hotel. The rudeness of the staff and the complete lack of service as disgusting. There is no consistency in the service - that's when you actually get it - and generally the staff are just rude. They are just hanging around and are complacent. Around the pool, which was full of screaming kids so I highly don't recommend you stay at this hotel if you want to relax. In addition there is absolutely no service around the pool whatsoever. Guests generally go down to the pool at 6am and leave their towels on a chair all day to reserve it - most of the time not being on the chair themselves. It's really badly managed - actually it's not managed at all. If we needed staff to assist with a spilt drink from someone elses doing we had to go looking for one. The staff manning the beach hut just stood around all day chatting to themselves. They could be way more useful. I feel they have been there way to long and it's time for a change of guard. The menus are ordinary, and too heavy for outdoor dining in the sun. Time to modernise and lighten things up. The arrogance of the concierge is mind blowing. The fact the staff are wearing badges to stop the outsourcing is hilarious. I'd get rid of them all straight away. We provided a $10 tip for bringing our bags down and watch the porter roll his eyes at the other porter as if to say this is all I got.

I have stayed at the Royal Hawaiian (Pink Palace), Sheraton Waikiki, and the Halekalani, but the Moana Surfrider is dearest to my heart!At Christmas it turns into a winter wonderland of displays of trains, gingerbread houses, all covered in glittering sugar. Towering spruces decorated in silver and gold ribbons and crystal ornaments. Oldest hotel in Waikiki its renovation is magical. The back courtyard facing the ocean (Moana means Ocean--kai means sea) surrounds an ancient spreading Banyan tree 70 feet tall with a spreading canopy 150 feet across. Perfect to sit in shade on one of the curved wooden and iron benches.It was renovated in 1989 at $50 million. The front of the hotel is a sweeping veranda with large maple and oak wood rocking chairs. They are wonderful for relaxing and watching the SLOW traffic on Kalakaua Avenue and seeing the guests pull up in private taxis (stretch limousines are everyday taxis in Waikiki) or rented Lamborghinis to be valet parked all under an arch.The lobby as with most large Waikiki hotels is an open lobby filled with incredible floral arrangements of Birds of Paradise, orchids, hibiscus, ginger, and ti leaves. The latter are glossy green leaves that make up the “grass skirts” of the hula dancers. You can learn to make a braided ti leaf lei.The back surround around veranda offers a sweeping view of the Pacific Ocean and white beaches. There are three freshwater swimming pools but I love the salt water of the Pacific. Just Diamond head (direction) of the hotel is the Waikiki Aquarium. The HIGH ceilings, beautiful sand beige and sky blue tasteful paint and art deco is relaxing--you are as one with the beach and ocean. Here on this back veranda is 4 pm high tea each day with delicate tea cakes and finger sandwiches. Sunday champagne brunch is a must with the ballroom off the veranda open with food. Sashimi, sushi rolls, bagels, cream cheese, lox (smoked salmon) capers, onions, and bagels...along with traditional breakfast fare of made to order omelets, fresh squeezed orange or grapefruit juice. Papaya, mango, starfruit. Dinner can be right on the beach under strings of light bulbs. The chef came out personally to see if we had enjoyed his lobster bisque made with real whipping cream.The service is impeccable and ALWAYS friendly with aloha spirit. Some might complain that the rooms are smaller than on the mainland. Space is a problem on a limited island (275,000 people LIVE as residents in Waikiki not counting the tourists.) But who stays in a room when Hawai’i is outside. Enjoy the most wonderful vacation of your life here among all the oak, maple, and teak panels, staircases, steps, and banisters. Remember that all has been transported by boat 2,000 miles for renovation.

So I started looking at SPG properties and found the Moana Surfrider. I was reluctant to book a non-Marriott property, but my status transferred over during the merger, so I had nothing to lose. Plus, the hotel sits right on the beach and when in Hawaii - that’s what you expect!We arrived via a private car and once we got out, there were no bellman or valets to assist us with our luggage. Our driver had to remove the bags and call for someone. At that point, two gentlemen came over, one for bags and the other with leis. Even our driver seemed shocked at the lackadaisical staff. And this wasn’t the only negative thing we encountered with the guys at the valet stand, but I’ll get into all of the negative things we noticed during our stay towards the end.Upon check-in, the gentlemen who greeted us was very welcoming. He informed us about the hotel and the items our status afforded us, to include a room upgrade. He offered us to rooms, which we decided upon a smaller room in the historic wing because of the ocean view. Overall, check-in was quick and easy!Our room was small, but like mentioned above, had an amazing view. It was a very cozy room and we overlooked both the beach and the courtyard, so every night we had the pleasure of listening to the live music wafting throughout the property as well as the waves crashing against the shore! The bathroom was also on the small side, but that wasn’t an issue for my wife or I. Housekeeping was great and prompt every day, as well super-friendly!The beach and pool areas were very nice and well maintained. For the most part, the staff in those areas were helpful and friendly. I’d recommend renting the beach chairs instead of the cabanas! Because when at the beach, your toes must be buried in the sand!We ate at the Veranda at the Beach House and the Beach Bar during our stay and both were good in both service and food. The buffet breakfast option was underwhelming for the price, but their açaí bowl was amazing. Try the poke nachos at the bar. My wife had a few treatments at the spa, and we also spent a few days just enjoying the spa facilities. Although on the small side, the spa facility was nice, as were the staff. The men’s side had two lounges, one with leather chairs and a TV, which is rare for spas, but cool nonetheless. The rear lounge had a great balcony to hang out on and watch the people and sunset. My wife said the women’s side was similar, but without a TV lounge. Each side also had showers, steam rooms (wet and dry), as well as jacuzzis.The Beach Club Lounge, which is for SPG members and those who pay - which is something I wouldn’t recommend doing - was horribly underwhelming. The options for breakfast are sparse and not really that good. The same goes for the evening snacks/food. It seems the only good thing about the Lounge is the outdoor seating areas- beach facing. If you don’t receive this benefit as part of your SPG status, don’t waste your money. There are better breakfast options at the numerous coffee shops within walking distance. We only used the Lounge for the cold bottles of water.OK, so the negatives...The staff, save for a few, didn’t welcome or greet us daily. They were all lost in their own worlds. At first, we thought maybe this was just how things are on the Island, but after visiting a few other hotels for dinner and drinks, we soon discovered this seemed to be a Westin Moana problem. The valet guys were always laughing and joking and were indifferent to the people coming and going. I watched many people come and go with bags - us included - and never once did the gentlemen in the front offer to assist. I’ve mentioned the underwhelming Club Lounge, and I can’t stress enough that if you’re paying, it’s not worth it unless is like $10 or something similar. Any more than that is a rip-off.On the morning of checkout, we called down for a bellman. After 20 minutes we gave up and lugged our luggage down to the front desk. At that point, I was asked if we needed assistance with our bags. Of course, I told them no and explained that I had requested assistance but no one ever showed up. I received an apology, but it didn’t seem sincere. At the very least, he should have called the bellman over immediately to take our items out for us. But alas, that didn’t occur. That’s all of the bad things! And in the long run, nothing too horrendous. But we were expecting a better welcoming atmosphere. Or at least friendlier staff! And I know I used the word, “underwhelming” a lot, but honesty, that’s exactly what this property was - a little underwhelming. But honestly, the room, location and views were hard to beat!So if you’re a Marriott or SPG member, this hotel offers a lot for your loyalty. And even if you’re not, this property is really nice and has tons of history. As long as you don’t expect friendly or helpful staff, or are least indifferent to that type of service, you won’t be disappointed at the Westin Moana Surfrider.","Riverside, California","BSStiefer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Riverside, California</strong>",23,4.0

The bottom line for me is that I genuinely loved the the hotel. I was captured by its architecture, its beachfront setting and the soft breezes that flowed through the lobby every day. Our room in the tower was absolutely wonderful and spacious and we spent virtually all our time on the balcony. The bathrooms were small but adequate and the shower had good pressure and was a great temperature. I also appreciated the electric toilet apparatus. Ate at the Beachhouse Restaurant every day of our stay. The staff there was very, very friendly and had excellent name recognition with us, though I found them to be overwhelmed and a bit unfocused. ""We'd like a table for two - room 1374...' Staff response, 'Did you say 1810?' This lack of genuine listening was a common problem in many areas of the resort - valet, concierge, front desk, laundry and housekeeping. We had small hiccups with all six areas of the resort. But overall, they did not dampen our pleasure at being at this wonderful location and enjoying our beautiful setting and guestroom. And I will say that the food at the Beachhouse was excellent. And when ever we were struggling with the staff, they were ALL very kind and though it took a LOT of extra communication, we were able to get all of our needs met. It is not the Four Seasons Ko Olina in terms of polished service (where I last stayed on Oahu), but we truly enjoyed the property and would not hesitate to return. We just won't expect a genuinely polished level of service, because the hotel has trouble delivering this in any department. I will say that I believe they very much mean well. Location on the luxury strip cannot be surpassed and the views of Diamond Head from many hotel rooms are well worth the additional money to achieve. I plan to return here the same time next year, as I believe this is the kind of place that warrants an annual tradition and Thanksgiving is a wonderful holiday on property.","Salt Lake City, Utah","sfdann</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Salt Lake City, Utah</strong>",293,4.0

Things we are enjoying - Buffet Breakfast on the verandah with beautiful views of the magnificent Banyan Tree and Waikiki Beach and sitting in the rocking chairs reading or watching the world go by. Things we are not enjoying - We are really disappointed in our room which has such a small bathroom and vanity that we could barely fit anything on the vanity. To be honest the room is so small we have barely unpacked. This is our second trip to Waikiki and the Moana Surfrider and last time we loved our room which had ocean views and felt very special staying here however, this time our views are of the main street which we is so noisy of an evening with loud music, cars revving etc... Sadly, we are not feeling special staying where we are staying this time as apart from our room being very small and unimpressive which we could tolerate we are not feeling very special staying on the 6th Floor as the last 2 evenings there have been private functions on this floor and we feel as though we shouldn’t even be there! When we come out of the lift to go back to our room we step into into the middle of the function with everyone dressed in their finery and looking at us like “what are you do here” and then we don’t even have a clear path to our room having to go around the “private function” signs and tall plants blocking the middle of the corridors which make you feel like you are trespassing even though this is the only way back to your room!My Recommendations - I would still recommend staying at the Moana Surfrider Resort just for the experience of staying in one of the oldest hotels in Waikiki but only stay in a King Room, request an ocean or partial ocean views & do not stay on the 6th Floor.Jan & Steve Chapple","Denarau Island, Fiji","janchapple</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denarau Island, Fiji</strong>",13,3.0

We have stayed at this venue on three occasions now. The staff are very polite, very efficient and the facilities are first class. The one issue that spoilt our most recent stay was the noise made by housekeeping staff. Every morning of our stay we were woken by the housekeeping staff preparing to start their work. They talked loudly to each other, thumped and banged as they loaded up their trolleys, and despite their friendliness, were a real nuisance. I reported this to the front desk a couple of days into our stay, but the problem persisted for the duration of our holiday. I do not know the full extent of the extra taxes and fees levied by Hawaiian hotels, but it seems excessive. Their ""resort fee"" of $33 USD per room per day on top of other statutory taxes seems a bit rich. Yes, you get free phone calls, free bottled water and a few other minor concessions, but it sure adds to your room cost. I believe it is at the discretion of each hotel as to whether the charge is applied or not.

I have wanted to stay there for a long time and I am glad I did, I did not have a bad stay but it was a mixed bag. I doubt I will stay there again. The good:The accommodations were great, the room was nice and clean, the bed was comfortable and my room was quiet. The property is located in the heart of Waikiki. Although service in the restaurants and at the desk was extremely slow, the staff was extremely friendly. The Bad:I arrived, I was asked if I needed help with luggage, I said we didn’t. I noticed that the people before me and after me (who asked for luggage assistance) were given a lei, I guess no luggage assistance and tip, no lei. We approached the lobby and saw that there were over 25 people in line. I found the gold check-in line and noticed when we got in it, people in the other line started rolling their eyes giving us looks. About 15 minutes later, I realized the reason for those looks, neither of the lines moving and there were only two people at the desk. Employee after employee kept coming out to the desk to get something but none of them waited on customers. I finally got to the desk and while checking in was told about resort fees. I knew that there was a resort fee, and I know a lot of hotels in Hawaii charge a resort fee – that doesn’t mean that I have to like it or agree with it. Like any hidden fee, it is a bad business practice and it meant to deceive customers while limiting the amount of commissions the resorts paid to travel agents. Most countries have outlawed this deceptive practice but it is alive and well in Hawaii. Personally, I love it when the front desk clerk with a straight hands me a piece of paper trying to justify the resort fee. It includes two bottles of water per day, a shopping bad, a surfing lesson on the sand (not making this up), a sunrise ceremony that involves the blowing of a conch shell and towels at the pool. I can do without all of that, is the $33 optional? No, it is not and if you wanted a beach umbrella or chair, that was not included in the resort fee. In fact, when I got to the room and read what was included in the resort fee, it mentioned the shopping bag and when I went back down to the desk to say I hadn’t received my bag, I was told that I should have when I checked in and they didn’t want to give me one. As a Marriott Gold member, I was told that I don’t get free breakfast as I do in other Marriott hotels but they would give me 10 percent discount in the restaurants. I later found out that it is not automatic, I had to ask for it. I was also told that the 10 percent off was only on the food, it didn’t include water, sodas and drinks. The service at the beach bar was extremely slow. It didn’t matter if we went down for drinks at the end of the night or went there for lunch – we typically waited 15 minutes before someone approached the table and there were at least two occasions where I had to ask if there was a waiter/waitress for that table. Although the hours of operation posted indicated the bar was open until midnight, we were told at 9:30 on a Friday evening (after waiting 15 minutes to be approached) that it was last call.","Los Angeles, California","LAGuy90019</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",142,3.0

The new shopping mall is directly across from the hotel.Room:We stayed in the tower (5th floor) and had a great view of the beach, ocean and Diamond head from our room. The cleaning staff was also very nice and provided us with extra bottles of lotion/soap. The room was big but it seemed empty. We had a bare wall that was awkward - needed decor. The bathroom was on the smaller side with only one sink. We could hear faint music from the pool/restaurant area but nothing that was disturbing. I actually enjoyed hearing it.Concierge:They were very helpful in recommending places to eat and gave us a magazine to read through to help us decide.Pool:The pool is VERY small considering the number of guests in the hotel. Seats are first come first serve and people occupy them by 7 am. We like to work out in the morning first so by the time we get downstairs, there are people lurking and waiting for people to leave their chairs. Guests have the option to book chairs and cabanas for a fee, but it should not be stressful trying to find a place to relax by the pool. Perhaps a time limit and online booking would help with the flow.Afternoon tea:My husband and I signed up for afternoon tea, which was a fun experience. The desserts were okay and we really enjoyed the tea options. The waiter seemed to be in a hurry because the kitchen was closing and did not take the time to explain the process (we had never had afternoon tea before). We ended up ordering another dish, but would have opted not to had the waiter explained how much food was already involved in afternoon tea. It also took a while to get our check.Breakfast:We had breakfast there a few times during our stay and really enjoyed the acai bowl with granola and fresh fruit. We were seated by the ocean one time and were able to get some good pictures. It was a relaxing experience.Gym:They have a spacious gym and yoga in the mornings. We used the gym almost every morning and it had all the equipment we needed. There were a few people there in the mornings, but never crowded.Spa:We booked a couples massage one of the nights. We had had a massage there a few years ago and wanted to go back. The treatment was not how I remembered it. It was more relaxing and laid back last time, where as I felt that the masseuse was rushing during our most recent treatment. It was still a good experience and we felt relaxed afterwards.Hotel overall:One of the elevators was down for a few days. There was a line of guests waiting to get up and down the tower, where our room was located, which sometimes took up to 10 minutes. In general, there were groups of people going in and out of the hotel, which was a little overwhelming at times. If you enjoy the action and being in a great location, then this is the hotel for you!","Rochester, New York","BucketListExpl0rer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rochester, New York</strong>",81,4.0

We've loved it for years and decided to stay there for my husband's big birthday. What we didn't know was that the hotel has transformed itself into a wedding factory, having sublet part of its first floor to a Japanese wedding company that has 3 chapels just off the lobby and has cordoned off part of the main level and outside gardens exclusively for its Japanese wedding guests. It was charming for the first few bridal parties. But practically speaking, waiting to board elevators while 3 brides and their entourages are in line became a pain. If you want to eat dinner in the hotel, (if you can get a reservation!) you'll likely be sitting among large wedding tables where photographers trip over you for cake cutting, etc. A photographer told me that the hotel is promoted in Japan as the destination for weddings and the company runs dozens of weddings through the hotel every single day. After awhile, we felt like wedding crashers. Otherwise, the staff of the hotel was great and we were very glad we upgraded to a room overlooking the beach so we could sit on our balcony. Unfortunately, we hadn't been warned that about the workers next to and dangling over our balcony for 3 days. When we called to ask how long they would be working no one seemed to know. The guest services person promised to call back but never did. I called again and was assured they would be done that day but they showed up again. We just gave up and put in earphones to keep the noise down. For the entire week we had workers dropping ropes onto us, popping their heads over our balcony, etc. We just did our best to ignore them. There was also an elevator out of service for 4 days which created a tremendous backup at times. Once again, we called and no one seemed to know how long it would be out or they promised it would be fixed the next day but wasn't. There seems to be a huge communication gap between the workers and the guest services folks. Note to management: You need to do a better job communicating with guest about all the repairs that seem to be going on.A few tips: If you need room for a crib or rollaway, only Tower rooms and some other rooms are large enough. Good to know this before you book a room that is too small. If you want one of the free pool lounge chairs, the line for towels & chairs forms at 6:45am. By 8 you won't find any chairs left unless you want to pay for a cabana or a beach umbrella/lounge combo. The pool is small and often dominated by loud, unruly children. There are simply not enough lounge chairs. Not the best hotel feature. The beach is great but gets pretty hot by midday.Room service: To me, the point of room service is to be available when you don't want to go out. But strangely, the room service at this hotel has very restricted hours. Lunch ends at 2:30; dinner runs 5:30-9:30 and then you're on your own. No all day dining. We arrived early afternoon and were told the only dining option was the pool bar. We sat at a table for half an hour and were told they had decided to close because it had started to rain. So we went back to the room and learned there was no room service until 5:30. True, you're in the middle of Waikiki but we ended up giving up on eating at the hotel after that except for one evening meal I'd booked ahead (you'll need to do that to get a table) and then discovered we were wedged between two wedding parties.One nice advantage of this hotel is that you can eat & charge your room at 3 other properties. We loved breakfast at the Royal Hawaiian (2 doors down). We also loved eating at the restaurants across the street at the International Marketplace (3rd floor). Be sure to make reservations wherever you want to go. Nice restaurants book up quickly even mid-week.One other tip: If you are ordering one of the hotel cakes for a special occasion, save your money. For $35 (with taxes & fees) you get a 3x3"" cake. (Like a brownie.) We laughed when we saw it. Cut it in quarters and had 4 bites.... Yes they throw some berries on it and write ""Happy Birthday"" in frosting on the plate, but it is truly ridiculous for the price. The cheese selection was nice, though. (Apparently once again, the company providing the cakes is a subcontract so the hotel promotes them but doesn't take any responsibility.)All in all, I'm not sure we'll stay there again. It's a lovely hotel and I'm sure it makes a ton of money catering to Japanese weddings, but it has really lost its appeal to those of us who want a quiet, hassle free vacation.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","dhbourke</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",14,4.0

We would always walk by this hotel and said one day we would stay there. This time we did and it was absolutely amazing! From the moment we drove up, we experienced impeccable customer service. Check-in was smooth and easy. We stayed in the Diamond Wing which I believe is one of the newer sections. When we got to our room, I was greeted with a plate containing dessert and ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate. I was slightly disappointed with the view outside our room as it was literally the rooftop. I went back downstairs to see if we could change. I was told she couldn't do anything that night but she had another room I could switch to the next day. I have had other hotels tell me that and they didn't deliver. I was pleasantly surprised when we were given a new room key after returning from Diamond Head! We packed up everything the night before like the told us to and our items were already in the new room. We had a late departure so we kept our stuff at the concierge while we strolled for the day. When we came back, they gave us a key to the hospitality room to freshen up before the flight.The location of this hotel is the best! Right on the main strip and walking distance to a lot of shops and restaurants. The beach is right outside the hotel or you can walk a block or two to where some of the locals swim. We also walked to the malls but you need a good walking shoe. Oh, and if you like to workout, you can borrow exercise clothes/shoes for $5.00/day. I thought that was a nice feature.If I had some negatives, it would be the cost of parking ($35 per day). You can't really find cheaper anywhere else. I was also disappointed by the $30 resort fee. I think for what you get it should be included in the price.

A beautiful classic beachfront property with oodles of history and amazing outside space. The stunning Banyan tree in a gorgeous courtyard with rocking chairs to take in the view and just steps away from the beach is all you could wish for. We had access to the Beach Club where at 5pm we would retreat to the private Verandah for a few glasses of chilled white wine and wait for the sun to set.

Every employee went out of their way to make me comfortable and see to my needs. Loved the rocking chairs on the front and back verandas! In the evening there were many places to sit and listen to music. The hotel is located in the heart of the best shopping and dining! I opted for a small room in the historic section of the hotel. My room was small but well appointed and comfortable and always clean. I thought about upgrading to a room with a view but decided to spend the extra money instead on a private cabana on the beach. I rented a cabana on two of my five days and it was well worth the money. Besides having some shade and privacy and a comfortable place to spend the day, it came with lots of towels, a small tote that was perfect for a wet swim suit when I got ready to pack for home, bottles of cold water, and fresh cold pineapple later in the day. During the day waitresses came by for drink and food orders. If there was anything that needed improvement, it was the sparseness of the cabana waitresses. The cabana/pool staff was fabulous, but the waitresses were few and far between, even non-existent my first day, and only showed up on the second day after the cabana staff requested one for me. I hate chasing down waitresses for a cocktail! That, however, was not the case anywhere else on the property.Note: This is not a good property for families looking for things for their kids to do, or for groups of young adults looking to party. This is an excellent property for couples of any age as it's quite romantic, or for older singles.

Maybe it's different expectations, or maybe we were unlucky, but we paid a lot of money to stay at this hotel and this is a very accurate description of our experience.Hawaii is a long way from the UK and we arrived at 11pm. We had booked one twin and one double, next to each other. Check-in took over 20 minutes. We were given 2 twin rooms, on the same floor, but not next to each other. When we questioned this we were told there was nothing they could do as they were overbooked. We were then hit with this ""resort charge"" which is an extra $37 per room for internet access and bottled water. In my experience, these things normally come included with the high prices you pay to stay in a 4 star hotel, and surely, that's part of the facilities they say they offer in order to get their 4 star rating?We went to our rooms and were immediately hit by the strong smell of smoke. Clearly these were smoking rooms - although Westin has a ""breathe well"" policy which states that you will be fined over $300 if there is evidence you have smoked in your room (this was on display on the in-room iPad used for promoting the hotel). We went back to reception and asked to speak to a manager. Nobody was available to speak to us. We were told that all they could do was spray the rooms. Nobody ever turned up to spray the rooms.Being jet lagged and fed up, and not having received the advertised friendly welcome and welcome elixir, we went to the bar to get a drink. The bar closed at 11, so they would not serve us. I know of no other hotel which would not serve a guest a drink. When we asked where we might get a drink, we were directed to the hotel next-door.We were in Deluxe Ocean Diamond rooms which were functional, cramped and clean, except for those difficult to get to places like air vents and door vents. These were thick with dust, hairs and what can only be described as toilet waste. I would liken the room and the tiny bathroom to a Premier Inn, but without their level of cleanliness.In the morning, we waited for 20 minutes in the breakfast queue. We again tried to speak to a manager about our rooms, but again nobody was available. Our travel agent also tried to contact management, and we resorted to emailing them, but we still have received no response. We received a standard ""we are experiencing high volumes of emails and will reply to yours in the order in which it was received"". That was a week and a half ago and we are now home. That must have been some level of emails they were receiving.The pool is tiny and you can't get anywhere near it. We stayed in a Villaplus villa in Corfu last year and the pool with that villa for 12 people was bigger than this hotel's pool.The gym was well equipped and spacious. The downside was that entry was by room key, so although the rules stated that children under the age of 16 couldn't use it, there were often kids, around 9/10 years of age in there. Their parents were also there, but ignoring them as they were too busy working out, so kids would be hogging the workout machines and running around trying out all the free standing equipment and leaving it all over the place.In our part of the hotel, there were about 80-100 room all being served by one lift, so there was lots of waiting around for lifts. We did try using the stairs (the ones we found seemed to be a fire escape route) but couldn't find how to get to lobby level using the stairs. One day the lift was out of service so we had to use the service lift, along with all the luggage and laundry, so that took even longer.Other reviews have mentioned the weddings. They do impact on your stay. On two of our five days there, we saw the first bride arrive at 7am (don't know about the other days as we were still in bed at that time!) our peak count was 13 in one day - and we weren't spending all our time at the hotel. Part of the hotel is permanently out of bounds to guests as it is reserved for weddings. The entry hall, from dawn to dusk, has brides and grooms and their families either posing for photos or waiting for the previous party to finish photos so they can begin their photos. Most of all, in an hotel already bursting to the seams, they add significantly to the number of people in the public areas. Not all couples get married in the chapel there, or take up the bookings in the restaurant for their ""wedding breakfast"", but loads come to have their photos taken.We were so disgruntled with the hotel we didn't eat there, apart from breakfast. We found some fabulous restaurants in the town. Roy's stands out as one of the best restaurants we have ever eaten at.The two best things about the hotel were that it was situated directly opposite the Haagen Dazs shop and that it was in a brilliant place to watch the amazing Honolulu Pride March go by.Maybe the guest services team will take the time to reply to this review and say how sorry they are and they will try to make other guests' experiences better. We tried very hard to get our issues sorted while we were there so we could have a better holiday, but nobody was interested. Far better to pretend on TripAdvisor that you care about your guests' experiences than actually try to improve their holiday while they are there?!","Northamptonshire, United Kingdom","nic0lah2017</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northamptonshire, United Kingdom</strong>",4,2.0

Some points to note:Tower rooms are decent size, super comfy bed and view straight onto another huge tower block making early morning coffee on the balcony an interesting neighborly event. Look to the left at sunset and our room was perfectly lined up to watch the sun disappear. No slippers so I was glad to have taken my own. The pool is small and I went looking for the real one. That’s it... but with the ocean on its doorstep that’s not too serious. Be prepared to reserve your pool seats well before breakfast, and to pay a fairly hefty umbrella and deck chair fee if you prefer to lounge on the beach. Also be prepared for a very child friendly pool with loads of splashes as parents happily dunk their kids in the water all morning.Be prepared to line up waiting for your turn for breakfast, tho it is managed well and runs efficiently. Despite the crowds we were mentioned by name on several occasions, and a very tasty breakfast.Evening entertainment in the lounge was very nice, especially the musician on Monday eve and super helpful Ryan K happy to suggest excellent snack and cocktail choices off the menu. Try the cheese and mushroom toasties and Brussels sprouts.Hotel is perfectly located for the Pink Line bus that will take you to further away shopping malls or the Hilton Hawaiian village if you are taking a boat activity from there. Two dollars each (no change given) and just a few steps away at Dukes statue.Lovely charming hotel, with an incredible tree in the courtyard that I’m sure could tell many stories.

We checked in & got a room that smelled like mildew/mold. (Reason #1 for only 4 stars) We tried to ignore it, but it was pretty bad, so after an hour & a shower (which leaked on the floor) we all had a headache from the smell so we called the front desk. We spoke with Michael who was AWESOME! He told us he’d call us back and got us a new room with no smell and no leaky shower. We hated to complain, but after walking in the new room, we all said how MUCH BETTER it was!!!!! Michael gave us a drink coupon for having to wait for his call back and move rooms (way to go Michael!) so we enjoyed late night wine at the Beach Bar.....where the bartenders were obviously tired and had a long day. Whatever, the wine was free and we were on vacation (kind of). ❤️The next morning after a night out at Duke’s, we decided to take a pool aqua aerobics class with instructor Crystal. Crystal was GREAT! We loved that class! I wish I could come from my house every time she teaches. I’d pay money to come join her & hear her laugh. That class was FUN! ‍♀️Before class started at 9am, the three of us tried to score chairs at the pool. Well, we didn’t realize you had to be up at 3a.m. to get a lounge chair! Literally....it was like 8:30 and NO seats were open because people threw towels on them (reason #2 for only 4 stars). I went to get towels from the pool and beach desk. There was a cabana rental sign with prices. I was a “little” hungover so I couldn’t understand the $55/$110 price differences on the sign and I asked Gloria. Gloria is definitely not a fan of hungover blondes asking questions at 8:30 in the morning. She was annoyed and avoided me with an eye roll. She TOTALLY redeemed herself the next few days so I’ll get to that later. After the aqua aerobics class, I decided I was GOING TO throw someone’s towels off a chair being it had been 90 minutes ....but I went to the desk again and praise God I met Isaac who completely made our entire weekend!!!! He was awesome too! You should def keep this guy around. He may need to be promoted. Isaac explained the cabana and umbrella situation at the pool and on the beach. One includes alcohol orders and one does not. Duh....obviously we reserved the cabana with alcohol options for the next day. Isaac had it all set up and ready for us at 9am when we arrived at the pool. What a treat! He was so nice to us! He must’ve teamed up with Gloria since yesterday because she brought us water, pineapple, a cooler, some dinner suggestions, AND sent the waitress over ASAP for us! Gloria was our new best friend with Isaac. My favorite waitresses at our cabana were Hays & Chantal. Those girls are on it! Cocktails, food, and water or ice - they are always smiling and FAST! We spent three days at the pool and the cabanas thanks to Isaac. The only other person worth mentioning in my review of this beautiful hotel on the beach is Pascual (like rascal) that works breakfast at the buffet. He’s super cute and friendly. I just wished I could’ve had a Bloody Mary with breakfast but he said that was not allowed in the rules at breakfast.

One wonderful waitress pointed us to some wonderful local fare...Side Street, but another one just went through the motions, barely. One night the kids were loud and security came up and told us to quiet down or "" things would get ugly."" I was stunned. Reported to management and she apologized and comped us two days at the Beach Club which gave us complementary breakfast and a nice room to chill. The last day my daughter cut her foot on broken glass when packing to leave. The thing is...we didn't break any glass during our stay. I assume housekeeping did but it was weird since we were in the room for 5 days. Management got her a band-aid and neosporin but still. You are a housekeeper and broke something, clean it up thoroughly.We travelled with a family of five, kids 17,15,11.I would not return again.

This is my 2nd time here - 1st 6 years ago with my now husband and this week for a work trip. I selected this hotel because the Sheraton was booked. This hotel does have good qualities but it is old, overrun by weddings, and the interior service (room service, concierge, etc) is awful. The staff at the restaurants and Beach Club lounge, however, have been very pleasant and capable.The pool is also the size of a typical plain rectangular shaped pool found in the backyards of any suburban home in the US. The Sheraton definitely has the better pool areas and the Royal Hawaiian next door gets access - stay there. No hot tub.I am here for work. There are worse places to be but this happens to be my anniversary weekend. My husband attempted to surprise me with bubbly, flowers, and cheese and arranged this thru the hotel. Note that I am staying in a suite (paid for, not upgraded) and with a platinum member. This treat was supposed to arrive while I was at work. Total fail. The Westin did not deliver until after a few angry phone calls from my husband and some follow up calls by me. Since they didn't deliver as scheduled, my day was completely screwed because I had to cancel business events so make time for the 'surprise'. For a hotel that hosts hundreds of weddings weekly, one would think that the simple exercise of delivering wine and cheese to a room would be a no brainer; yet, sadly not the case. The $300 surcharge and late delivery prove that this hotel is incompetent and overpriced. The same cheese tray was available FOR FREE in the lounge, by the way. And no overnight room service. Stay somewhere else and visit during the day like most people. This hotel is overrun by people staying at neighboring hotels without beach access. The breakfast buffet is completely not worth the expense even if comes with room or status. Takes forever to get a table and the food is underwhelming - too many places nearby to settle for this hot mess of a buffet.","Houston, Texas","EBell22</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",8,2.0

They accommodated our request so we ended up in a higher room more toward the beach which made a signififcant difference to our holiday.Room was spacious and had all we needed in terms of amenities, wifi and daily bottled water (SPG members). Well serviced every day and unlike other places the room attendants did leave the air con on for us after servicing which was very much appreciated.Beach bar is in a nice location and surroundings - plenty of people. Service was good as was the food (note it was bar food not restauarant food). We did not try the restaurants at the hotel as we ate out due to good central location.We liked the fact we could enjoy the bars at adjacent SPG properties and still charge to our room at this property.People and service were all good and easy to deal with which always makes a difference. Things to consider:Key I think is to ensure you understand what room you have and what your room type may mean for your stay. The rooms nearer the street (hotel is between beach and street) and on lower levels are not great and changing when you arrive may not be easy due to other bookings.In hindsight as first time visitors to Hawaii we arrived at 8am and should have booked our room for the night before so as to enable access - Hawaii is hot and we were tired from the flight so while it involves a cost, it would have been nicer to head straight to a room for the early flight arrival time.We will ask for a ""grill"" balcony next time around - looks like 50% have a grill at the front you can see through and 50% have a concrete panel you look over to see the view - we are not that tall so harder to see when sitting on the balcony.The pool was pretty small but our firends 10 year old enjoyed it.

The architecture is beautiful and you can feel the history of place as soon as you walk in the grand entrance.The check in process was quick and easy but we did arrive early on a Sunday morning so I wouldnt expect anything less. Due to it being so early (approx 7:30am) our room was not ready so they offered us the use of a room to shower and freshen up. They then took our details so they could advise us (by text to our mobile) when our room would be ready. We enjoyed a breakfast buffet at Dukes (next door) and then killed sometime in the pool.Once in our room I was a little underwelmed. It does feel a little dated but we did have a decent partical view of the beach. We had 2 queen beds as we are a family of 3. The beds were comfortable and the quality of sleep was good.The hotel facilities were very good, we only tried the Beach Bar and the food was decent and atmosphere was great. The service was OK but a little inconsistent.I think the biggest issue I have is the value for money. The room price and resort fee combined meant that we were spending approx $400 USD per nigth on accommocation. While I realise that Waikiki is expensive I simply dont believe that we got decent value for money.The pool was decent and being there with my 5 year old we spent a lot of time there. The other reason for spending time in the pool rather than the beech was due to the $50 per day that the hotel wanted for an umbrella! This was a particularly frustrating policy when most of the umbrellas sat there unused as people had them for an entire day but never came back after an hour or 2 of use. I believe it would be in managements best interest to offer half day or even less hire as I believe they would end up with more people utilising them and most imprtantly more happy guests.In summary I would recommend Moana Surfrider as from what I could see this is the best on the beach (with guest private access to the beach) but it comes at a price.","Melbourne, Australia","email_iandsmith</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",20,4.0

It's not modern and flashy so don't expect that. The Moana was the first hotel to be built in Waikiki and the decor reflects this. It has a relaxing opulent feel to it and we will always stay here as it always delivers on our expectaions. Yes they do have a lot of weddings here as it is so beautiful but I never found these encroaching on our holiday at all. The beach bar under the stunning banyan tree is fantastic, it's very busy so there is lots to see. Don't expect the drinks to be cheap...this is a prime spot...i did not how ever find them extortionate. The beds and bedding are devine, so good infact that I am going to go online and buy there pillows...they are awesome. We did not find the city view room to be too noisy, nothing really happens along the main street until after 10am any way. Staff are great and nothing is a problem. As an added bonus the best coffee in town is right on the premises at Honolulu Coffee. Over all the price of staying at the beautiful Moana is well worth it.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","angiej499</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",5,5.0

I've stayed here because someone else chose it and someone else was paying the bill. If was up to me, we would have stayed somewhere else, quite a bit cheaper and probably less busy and definitely quieter. The hotel is beautiful. There is no doubt that it is a lovely looking place to stay. But unfortunately, beauty is not everything.Check in is quite slow, our rooms both times were quite small and quite noisy. We had to turn the air con off at night as it was too loud, then after an hour, we had to turn the fan off too, as it was making a clicking noise which made it impossible to sleep. The good thing about having the air con on, is that it partically drowned out the noise from the people in the room next door. The walls where we were seem to be paper thin and we could hear a lot of noise from the room next door. We were woken up the first morning at 5 am, when the young children in the room next door woke up. I don't know why people take young kids into expensive hotels, but, if they do, you would think they would make a bit of an effort to keep them quiet??? Luckily the parents took the kids out at 6 am, but by then, I couldn't get back to sleep anyway. I also found the bed a little hard and really missed the classic Marriott-type mattress and bedding. I was expecting something more luxurious for the price. The lift is also very slow, and on one day, broken! (There is only one lift that serviced the area where we were staying so we chose to use the service elevator instead, ignoring the sign that said it was only for staff use). I think that a lot of the clientele that stay in this hotel are a bit more interested in status than comfort. It is also a very popular place to get married. You see bridal couples everywhere, all the time, which is sort of cute, but it can get annoying when you have to get around them (like physically walk around the huge gowns) a lot. The beach bar and pool area are fantastic and it is indeed a beautiful hotel. It is a pity that the rooms don't match up to the standard of the public areas. I would have been very disappointed if it were me paying the bill to be honest.","Auckland, New Zealand","Mickey-lovingKiwi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",30,3.0

For Hawaii I would say this hotel was ""Average"", nothing spectacular that made it stand out. We booked a room in the historic part with a city view, but received an ocean view; which was a nice surprise. The room was old style, which we expected. It was larger than we figured it would be but with a very small bathroom. Beds were very comfortable, no complaints there. Rooms had large windows, that did not lock, but only opened approx. 8"". We did enjoy the large windows to let the sun light in. The doors to the room do not seal very well and lets in plenty of light and noise. House keeping did a good job of keeping everything nice and neat, no complaints there.The water pressure was nice, but a very...I mean very small bathroom. Two people cannot fit in it at the same time.This is a very crowded hotel with, I'd say, 5-6 weddings every day. Beach was good size for Hawaii, but it is directly next to the public beach, being that this is the last hotel. Which isn't a problem, because all the beaches are public. The beach side bar was extremely expensive. $13 for a small tropical drink and it was so strong you couldn't drink it. Service was poor. I only went their once, but had to wait while the bartenders finished their conversation before they took the time to take my order. Service over all was ""OK"" at best. The staff pretty much just went through the motions. Everything was pretty expensive, which is expected in Hawaii, but we found other hotels with better drink deals and a friendlier atmosphere worth the money. We basically slept here and went elsewhere for fun and activities.Self parking is across the street behind another hotel. Not difficult to get to get in and out of, but I believe that is mainly because of the friendly Hawaiian drivers. Even though there is a lot of traffic, the Hawaiian drivers never feel rushed or pushy. Use your turn signals and they will let you in without any problems. So do not hesitate renting a car. Expect to add about $450 to your stay for hotel parking (self) and resort fees for a 6 night stay.","Danville, Illinois","twpiatt</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Danville, Illinois</strong>",9,3.0

Luckily it's a beachfront property (why we chose it in the first place) and we were up early each day to enjoy the amenities. Service is standard, staff aren't proactive in enhancing your stay unlike a lot of other resort properties we've stayed at. We came back to our room also unlocked after it was serviced by housekeeping. Unless you're with a travel group, you don't get much of welcome when you arrive. We were waiting in line to be checked in for about fifteen minutes while travel groups got lei'd and had seats while they were serviced. We stayed at the Surfjack after three nights at the Moana Surfrider and had an amazing experience with superior room quality and customer service for almost half the price; at the Surfjack you're welcomed with refreshments and an agent comes to you at a seating area when there's a wait but it's not beachfront.

For context, we are mother and daughter, and we required an accessible room as my mother is in a wheelchair. We had booked an ocean view accessible room.We knew this was the oldest hotel in Waikiki, and the main area of the hotel itself is lovely. Unfortunately, the area they had put us in was not the nice section of the hotel. If you are booking a room in the Diamond section, be warned. This is an outdated, hot and stuffy, rundown part of the hotel. We had requested a room with two beds and were given a room with one double bed. For our expensive stay in this ""four star resort"" I had to sleep on a rollaway bed. The room was incredibly tiny. The furniture in the room blocks the path from the door to the very small balcony so a wheelchair cannot fit past. The furniture is old and outdated, the air conditioning in the room is loud, the decorating needs updating and the beds were uncomfortable. The bathroom was only okay. The only good thing about the room was the view.We stayed in this shoebox for one night and they then transferred us into an accessible room in the same section with two double beds, but due to the fact that it was hot, the room smelled and it was in the same rundown ancient section of the hotel, we decided not to stay. We booked a room at the Hilton Garden Inn and moved across.I found the staff rude, the wait times long and everything ridiculously overpriced. Breakfast for two people was nearly $100. The resort fees are over $40.00. Yes, the hotel is in a prime location, but it is a total rip-off. If you are staying in the Diamond section of the hotel you can see right into the windows of the older original section as well.No two people have ever hated a hotel as much as we hated the Moana Surfrider, and I would never recommend it to anyone. There are better hotels in Waikiki that don't cost a small fortune. Just wander in and look at the building - you don't need to stay there. I would give it zero stars but I've given it two due to the fact that they tried to help us, and that the room itself was clean and tidy. It was just really old, and they charge a fortune for it, and it's just not worth it.","Townsville, Australia","Felicity D</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Townsville, Australia</strong>",8,2.0

When I told the pool attendant, he gave me goggles and told me to verify for sure. I told him that it looked like poop, and my daughter said that she's pretty sure it's poop, and I was not interested in going back in the pool. So he shrugged it off and did nothing. No pool evacuation, no chlorination, no announcement to hotel guests, no interest in doing anything, didn't care. Aside from the poop, the pool was not well maintained.

There was the distinct smell of smoke in the room - the staff that came up to check verified the smell was in fact cigarette smoke. A complaint to the front desk resulted in us being moved the next day; my 5 yr old, 6 month old baby, wife and I were stuck smelling stale smoke until then. All we got for our inconvenience was an apology - no compensation or complimentary breakfast (by the way the hotel breakfast is $42 / adult daily).

The beach is a few steps away from the lobby. The hotel grounds are gorgeous and impeccably maintained.I would suggest that if you planning on booking this hotel either pay for a suite, wait for their standard room price to be heavily discounted or book elsewhere - its simply not worth paying the regular rate for one of their standard rooms plus their resort fee ($34/day) plus the fee for breakfast ($42/ adult per day - kids eat free)",Canada,"ron g</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",0,3.0

We had to wait for the third bed to the brought to our room, despite it being late at night, the pillow and cover were smeared with blood. We had been travelling for nearly 30 hours, so we just made the best of it and turned in for the night. We were very conscious the following day that the insulation between the rooms was poor and a door connecting the next room had a large gap underneath, so we could clearly hear our neighbours. On the third night we were kept awake by a young baby in the next room, which cried a great deal. The following morning I spoke to reception, who apologised but told me they were checking out that day. Unfortunately they were followed by another family also with a very young baby. After 2 nights of no sleep and really suffering, I approached reception again. The family were staying for a further 3 nights, so the solution suggested by the receptionist, to our noise problem was get ear plugs. I was flabbergasted.

The rooms are spacious although not luxe, really comfortable beds and good bed linen. We're about half way along the side of the tower and the views of the Ocean are OK, although any further back and the view would be very partial indeed!!The staff here are great, welcoming and professional, took the time to remember our names which was a nice touch, the concierge seems a bit hit and miss, but may be just a reflection of Island life. The resort fee entitled us to ""free"" International calls, water in the room, a buffet breakfast and a mobile wifi dongle per room which were all good ( especially the wifi with teenagers and when we were out and about) The hotel itself is sandwiched between a thin strip (10m) of Waikiki beach and the main Waikiki strip on Kalakaua avenue. The original Victorian era hotel is a beautiful building with open verandas and Lanais front and back, the additions, including the bit we were staying in ( like most of Waikiki) are uninspiring concrete hi rise. The elevators were fine although the asian sense of personal body space is obviously different leading to us playing the ""how many Japanese tourists can we cram in this lift"" game a few times!!Where the hotel really lets itself down is the under-provision of common area facilities, especially for such a large hotel. There are about 50 free sun beds available - although there is generally a queue at 7am for them when the pool area opens, there are also a 3 or 4 cabanas for hire ($150 usd/ day, not sure what facilities ) or a limited number of sun beds on the beach itself ($55 usd/day... more for a parasol). The hotel isn't short of space, but they dont open it up to their guests it in an attempt to monetise it. There is a large lawn area ( largely unused) reserved for wedding parties, there's a ""beach club"" that again seemed largely unpopulated which you could join for a fee ( although it kind of looked like an airport departure lounge so we didn't ) and in the evening a big part of the terrace was reserved for Jalpak ( an Asian tour company) customers for a buffet. In the morning most seemed to have the buffet breakfast included but any time after 8.30 am resulted in a long (20 minute) queue to be seated, once there the breakfast was fineThe pool is really small and largely used by folks with toddlers, as the surf on the beach tends to be too rough to allow smaller children to play safely at the waters edge. The beach itself is great, white sand, but fairly narrow and due to the famous Waikiki surf, wear beach shoes as the seabed has a fair amount of sharp rock exposed - also you need to keep your wits about you as there are a fair few novice surfers who are concentrating more on staying on the board than where it is heading!!To compound the crowding the hotel is very open to both the beach and the strip with lots of non residents wandering in to use the facilities. In the evening I was glad we had inter- connecting rooms as there was no access control on the tower lifts and a separate entrance in to it off the strip so anyone could have been wandering in. The result was that we didn't really stay in an around the hotel during the day ( no real hardship as the beaches down the road are great, but you need a car) or in the evening ( again no hardship as the strip has a great selection of both international and local bars, eateries and shops literally in your door step) In my opinion if you want to enjoy the Moana Surfrider, save some money and book a hotel non beachside, then wander in with everyone else!!","Oxfordshire, United Kingdom","925williamsfam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oxfordshire, United Kingdom</strong>",6,3.0

As the room wasn't ready, we had lunch and our first taste of Waikiki beach, the banyan tree and the colourful view. Ate at the The Beach Bar food is fairly standard with a small but good selection of both food and drinks. Our room was in the original part of the hotel which is full of character, the room was fairly small with a very small bathroom but had everything you might need, coffee making facilities, water regularly replenished and a good selection of toiletries. As our room faced the city there was some traffic noise especially when on the balcony but this is to be expected. If the hotel has a negative its that the addition of the tower and all of the subsequent rooms have overpowered the available facilities. There is often a long queue at reception, no chance whatsoever of getting near the small pool or on the beach beds and even finding a table at busy times is a challenge. One positive of this is that it ensures that you leave the hotel and see all of the highlights of Waikiki, Honolulu and Oahu.","Manchester, United Kingdom","AndasC</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",38,4.0

Our room was clean and we had a partial beach view, which is exactly what we got. There was one incident where a couple on our floor had an argument with the female being locked out of the room and us being woken up by her banging and yelling like a drunken lunatic. Security did arrive eventually and diffuse the situation but there was no apology from management which would have been appreciated. Sometimes it's not about getting a discount or something for free, but just management acknowledging a situation and apologising for it.The pool area does get overly crowded with people placing towels on chairs to save spots. The Management has signs up saying people's towels will be removed if they are in use for 60 minutes, however we did not see this to be the case. Being so close to the beach however, we did not use the pool at all due to the crowding so much preferred the beach. We did hire a beach umbrella and chairs for the day costing $55USD + gratuity - I didn't really understand the gratuity since no one actually done anything for me or provided me with a service.The Beach Bar - The drinks were amazing, especially the strawberry daiquiri with vodka, moana cooler and the blue Hawaii, highly recommend! The food is standard, but I would not recommend the Caesar Salad as it smelt funny and was practically inedible. The breakfast is decent, they are huge portion sizes but the costs match the sizing, it was also around 32 or so USD for a buffet breakfast. I found the wait staff did monitor their tips with one staff member not letting us leave without her full tip.. The bill with gratitude came to a total of something like $50.47 and we gave her $50, but she pushed the issue for the 47 cents.

The property itself is beautiful as it has preserved its history and is full of the wonderful original details. It opens on the stunning courtyard which features a majestic Banyan tree with the backdrop of the azure waters of Waikiki. That's what is going to keep me in this hotel... the rest, I could leave it behind right away. When we checked in last night we weren't greeted with any particular Hawaiian touch... might as well have checked in a hotel in Chicago! We were assigned a room which size wise was perfectly fine however the size of the bathroom is so small that not more than one person can fit in at the same time! I also noticed that the room had two very small windows which whilst adding to the charm of this old building when we woke up this morning Immediately showed that the room has virtually no natural light. Is a little bit like being in the loft of an old house with a bathroom the size of an airplane toilet. I complained and I was offered to move to a different room, same category on a different floor.... would need to pack up again.... then wait 3pm to get to the new room... not ideal. So I said ""no, thank you"".... and when I expressed my disappointment I was told ""thanks for letting us know""!!! By the way, I did not ask or expected an upgrade.The next experience was the students canteen queue to get to breakfast! Never seen anything like this. We gave up after ten minutes and went somewhere else outside the property. When we asked what time is a good time to go for breakfast without having to stand there for ages we were told ""6am""... hum.... seriously???? Is that what they expect guests to do? We are on holiday. Finally, the cherry on the cake. Despite getting to the pool at 7.30 am all sun beds (but two) were ""occupied""... apparently the hotel is busy, so what do they expect guests to do? Sit on the floor? Usual story with the few, emphasis on few, sun beds at the beach. All booked and for a charge and squashed together in 10sqm! I thought I had booked a hotel on one of the most beautiful and famous stretch of beach in the world and we were left we having to make the most of our first day of relaxation by looking for a decent place to relax without using any of the amenities supposedly on offer in this kind of property.","Zurich, Switzerland","EvaCJ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Zurich, Switzerland</strong>",58,3.0

Haley sorted it wthout any problem. The room we were allocated was in the historic part of the hotel and was excellent. Haley did inform us that there may be some noise as it is on the city side. This did not prepare us however for the amount of noise generated by traffic, pedestrians and street musicians performing till after 0100. I'm sure that secondary double glazing would work wonders and not spoil the aesthetic exterion appearance of the hotel. A special mention too for the room cleaners who were superb. Our room was always immaculate after their visit. Breakfast buffet was in my opinion quite expensive at $85 including tax but I suppose eating it 2 yards from the beach and 20 yards fromthe surf offset it a little bit.The resort tax of $30 per day was a little hard to stomach when Haley informed me but part of it gives you free phone calls anytime to anywhere was a godsend as I have sick parents back home inthe UK.Overall i would reccomend this hotel but would rate it even higher if the noise issue could be sorted out.

We are a family of five, so we booked two rooms. The Moana is a Westin property, so I had originally booked it because Westin's are always pretty good. But some of the 1-star reviews made me really concerned and added stress before our trip. This review will, hopefully, go a long way towards reducing stress for other travelers. Room Size: The rooms are not super spacious but they are not small. Same with bathrooms. Beds: Very comfortable; we all slept very well.Food: There are two main restaurants - the beach bar and the Veranda. As you would expect, the food is not inexpensive. But it was good. There is a ""beach club"" which is really what frequent travelers like me think of as the lounge. The club is gorgeous, with expansive ocean views and steps from the beach. So you can keep going to the beach, come in for refreshments, go back .. just perfect. If you have SPG Platinum status, lounge access is free, otherwise it is $62.5/day for four people, $30 for every additional person. We had to pay $30/day for the fifth person. For us, the lounge was good value but each group will have to make its own decision. They have a good breakfast (scrambled eggs, breads and croissants, fresh cut fruit, miso soup, oatmeal, and sides - on weekend days they have either pancakes or waffles or french toast also added); snacks during the day are salted nuts and fresh popped corn. Evenings they offer one dish (either dumplings, fried rice, pasta, etc.), a good salad bar, steamed edamames. It is good enough for a quick dinner if you've had a long day and don't want to spend time waiting for service in the restaurants (which is slow, not very slow, but slow).Service: In recent years, I have become very pessimistic about service from US businesses - hotels, airlines, etc. Training is poor, staff are inexperienced - all likely a function of the focus on cost, cost, and cost. Against those declining expectations, service at the Moana was very good except for a couple of minor exceptions. For example, we had a minor maintenance issue. I called, waited 30 minutes, then had to call again to tell them we had some urgency. Once I explained the urgency, the guy was there in minutes. But the first round of communication was less than satisfactory. Check-in: Our check-in experience was very pleasant both in terms of the time it took and the interaction at the counter. Small nit: I have SPG Platinum status but I did not get an upgrade. The representative (a woman) said that they did not have an upgrade to offer until three days into the trip. I said fine, please put us on for the upgrade starting on the fourth day. She promised she would and that they would call us on the third day. No call. This is typical of US service business in recent years and probably a reflection of both evolving culture and corporate practice - no follow through, no training. Again, though, we had excellent rooms with partial but gorgeous ocean views. So I am not complaining about the rooms, only about the lack of follow through. I also suspect that they only offer upgrades to folks who stay 2-3 nights; they don't want to lock up the pricier rooms even for Platinums for longer. Perhaps consistent with mercenary corporate culture at today's ""service"" businesses. But be aware that almost every other time I walked by the check-in desk, the lines were at least 20-30 minutes long. Even at the elite check-in. One day I had to go get replacement keys because one of our keys was not working. There were two people ahead of me in the elite lane. It took over half an hour. I also experienced an uncomfortable event - one of the hotel personnel came out to with glasses of water to offer to the folks in the Platinum line. She offered the water to the couple in front of me and then to the folks behind me, and then offered it to me after the folks behind me declined. I did not need the water but the fact that the folks ahead of and behind me were white, and I was not white gave me a fleetingly uncomfortable sense. Having mentioned that, I feel compelled to say that every other interaction was extremely pleasant and we did not feel discriminated in any way at all. Location: Perfect; short drives to Diamond Head (you could even hike all the way to the top from the hotel), Manoa Falls, and Hanauma Bay. Busy shopping district. If you don't have beach/water ready shoes, go to the Crocs across and buy a pair on your first day. You won't regret spending the money - whether it is $20 or $80.Aloha Beach Service: One of our daughters took a surfing lesson. It was great and we bought the CD with the photos/videos. Not cheap, but the service was good. Don't rent beach floaties at $5/day. Like my enterprise spouse did, go across the street to the ABC store and buy the floaties for $4 + $1 for pumping air in them. Days 2 and beyond are free :-D. Plus you can pack them and bring them back home for use in your own pool or local aqua recreation area.Local restaurant tip: Waiting time can be hours (literally) at every place within walking distance, so call ahead and book a table well in advance. Other tips: Free group hula lessons (hour long) in the Royal Hawaiian area (excellent garden, by the way) every day. Check the schedule. For snorkeling, we did both Hanauma and Pupukea (75 minute drive to the North Shore). If you don't have time, you can safely skip Pupukea. As far as I could tell, the main advantage is the opportunity to see sea turtles. Other than that it is a much less enjoyable experience because it is rock, the rocks are slippery, access is harder, etc. etc.Moana has its own small strip of the Waikiki beach front. Enjoy it. It's great. What can the Moana do to improve its service: The resort fee feels like a complete scam, at least for elites. As a platinum guest, I already get free premium internet. The fee gets us nothing else. So why isn't it waived for Platinum elites? I have been a loyal elite for years and years. We also paid for two rooms for five people (including three children) without even trying to ask for a fifth person to be accommodated in our room. Still, the check-in representative did not offer to waive the $30 beach club fee for the fifth person. Granted, I did not ask. Many of us do not like asking, but we do notice when it is not offered. You are in the hospitality business. There is very little you can do to make us feel special. The fact that the hotel is in a great location is something we pay for, so that is not part of the ""extra mile."" $30/day is not a big deal but a small gesture like that would have left me feeling like posting a glowing review for the Moana. As it stands my summary is it is an excellent hotel, in a great location, with good service - definitely not exceptional service (I mean the hotel service staff actually ask you to hold the lift, come in with a huge cart while asking if it is OK, and request you to press the floor button for them :-D ... that is probably the one star between a four star and a five star).","Los Angeles, California","992pn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",16,5.0

I absolutely loved our room in the new tower section and the awesome view of the beach. I would not hesitate to return here as the location cannot be beat and the hotel is kept immaculate. They provide an iron, ironing board, shampoo, conditioner, body wash, body lotion and soap so no need to carry those items. The best thing in the room was the electric dual purpose toilet/bidet with remote. Beds were very comfortable. They only clean the rooms once a day. There is ho turn down service.Waikiki is quite expensive but we pre-booked meals and tour packages in advance so we were extremely happy we did so.I highly recommend this resort.",NJ,"Ereggae</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>NJ</strong>",96,5.0
