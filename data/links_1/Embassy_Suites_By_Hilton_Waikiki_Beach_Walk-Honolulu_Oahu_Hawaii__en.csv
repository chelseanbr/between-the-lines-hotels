The staff are friendly and will treat you like family. Right off the bat, Matthew at the front desk made sure I had all I need and followed up daily to ensure that I am comfortable. I am not a picky with where I stay but I can securely say that out of all the hotels I’ve stayed at in Waikiki, Embassy Suites gave me the best experience and the only place I feel I would be willing to stay indoors at for 14days straight. It’s like living in a furnished apartment where you have everything you need and if you don’t the staff are kind/friendly enough to expeditiously deliver whatever your needs are.Definitely 10/10 for awesome staff, great comfy suites, and outstanding overall experience.",,Rizzz85,0,5.0

I stayed in two bedroom suite...and upon arrival, room was very worn and in need of updating. Our room was also dirty. So much so, I immediately went to front desk and voiced concern. I provided photos and front desk sent someone up to clean!. Was terribly dust ridden, for $500 a night I expected far better. Once cleaned, things went much better... but room condition not on par with other Embassy Suites. The two best features were the breakfast/pool area and overall location. Breakfast a wonderful experience for family of 5. Pretty much same thing every day but well worth it and good variety. Staff at breakfast wonderful! Every evening also had drinks and snacks...all this included as part of staying with Embassy. Location of hotel adjacent to and connected to Beach Walk on one side, however opposing side of hotel nearly abandoned and run down. Location to Beach just short walk away... maybe one block or so straight ahead on path. Car rental available next door and could return after hours at Embassy for small fee.I would stay again, but not my first choice and currently does not warrant as high a rating as is shown. With remodel...no hesitation... would highly recommend! For comparison, I checked out Trump hotel next door... night and day (Trump elegant and absolutely beautiful), however Trump similar room $1500 per night and no breakfast included, plus very small pool.When I return, I wy check out Embassy again, but if not remodeled... would pass.",Mt Zion IL,"T C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Mt Zion IL</strong>",26,3.0

Really had a lot of difficulties with the overall appearance of the hotel being worn and dated and a little less than clean. Yes, we understand it is a high volume hotel and location and yes, we understand that is clearly caters to families, but, with that being said, that isn't an excuse for less than stellar front desk personnel and the overall feel of the property.It is in desperate need of an update, some cheerier paint and a wee bit of attitude adjustment in some of the front desk staffing.As a loyal Diamond, we did receive a lovely room upgrade, no complaints there, however with the quick turnaround, the room was just not satisfactorily clean. At all. Grimy would fit the bill and so would dusty.The location is great, a very short walk to so many things and that is an absolute plus.Would we stay here again? For the price...maybe??? If you're traveling w/ family, then I think you'll find this place acceptable and will met your needs.","Bradenton, Florida","Ellesor826</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bradenton, Florida</strong>",259,3.0

First, they had a welcome drink for us when we checked in. Second, we were upgraded to an ocean view room...I think because we have gold status. (I booked the room through Costco Travel.)Third, happy hour was amazing! They had an entire menu of drinks that they served for free every night. Nice Hawaiian drinks too.Fourth, the full breakfast! This not only saved us money, but it’s was a legit full and fresh breakfast. They had two lines, so there’s was never a wait. Fifth, the location! I don’t think I’ll stay anywhere else after staying here and seeing just how central it is to the beach, restaurants, and shopping. Overall, between the amazing customer service, the kind house keepers, and everything listed above, I will return. I will recommend this hotel to there too.

The hotel staff were friendly, and made sure that we were taken care of. The hotel room was always clean, and housekeeping always made sure we had enough towels. We were often in the room at different times during the days so our boys could nap, but housekeeping was extremely considerate and would ask us for the best time to clean our room. Our room was a king room in the Aloha Tower. It was perfect for two adults and two young children. You can hear the elevator throughout the night, but it did not bother me. Some days the elevators were busy and it was difficult to get up or down depending on the time of day. Breakfast was unreal! I was so impressed, never bored of the options. The omelettes were great! Evening reception was good, some people enjoyed the free drinks more than others! The entertainment was amazing!The pool was never crowded even though the hotel was full most of the nights we stayed. Our 3 year old loved the kiddy pool and always found a friend or two to play with!We were unable to use our balcony during our entire stay due to construction. We spoke to the hotel staff and they gave us a choice of late checkout or a free night. We were very thankful and chose to have a free night. Overall, this hotel is amazing for families!

They are the most talented family, GREAT singers, who can pretty much sing everything from Neil Diamond to Guns & Roses to The Righteous Brothers to Bruno Mars...and more.

We walked the block to the beach twice, but the water was too cold for us...nothing ES could do about that. Neither could ES do anything about the crying babies at all hours of the night. My wife never eats breakfast, but we ate breakfast here every morning. Waiters in the dining room like Aldrin worked very hard to keep the area clean and welcoming. With 2 chefs and 6 omelettes going at once, it was a very short wait for yours and well worth it. Wide variety of food at the buffet. The evening manager’s party was lots of fun. Drinks were free and very good. Shane behind the bar made excellent margaritas. With 2 bartenders the line went fast...very little waiting. The band on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday was excellent (see picture). The manager of this event kept the room and tables clean and atmosphere inviting. For us the dance floor was a bit small, but we love to dance, and not everyone does. Relying on the reviews, we gave up our king room when we checked in due to the close proximity to the elevators. When waiting for an elevator, they did not seem that noisy, but perhaps in a room immediately adjoining them it may have been noisy especially if you are a light sleeper. Our queen bed was perfect for us...no lumps, no sagging just a great comfortable bed. Would have preferred a king away from the elevators, but I understand there were none. We had a city view room, and we were happy with it Loved having two rooms with each room having its own television. So we would definitely stay here again and hope to make that happen next year.

The complimentary breakfast buffet, evening reception with complimentary drinks and snacks are great value which is not found anywhere else in Waikiki. Four nights a week the Hawaiian family band, Kanilau, plays at the evening reception and is one of the main reasons we keep coming back. We are always greeted warmly by everyone from the bellman, Mr. Dean, to the front desk personnel, to the housekeeping, breakfast and evening reception staff. While all staff are always very friendly and helpful, certain staff stand out each time we stay here. Aldrin, Resty and Jay on the breakfast staff always greet us with a warm handshake or hug and say “welcome home” and ask us what they can do to help us. Cary came by our table at breakfast each day to check on us and to offer suggestions for things to do, places to eat or places to buy souvenirs or clothing for the best price. Justyn, at breakfast and also in the pool area was also very helpful. Our housekeeper, Crisfel, was so nice and made our room very comfortable during our stay.

My experience is as follows:1. When checking in there is no clear queue, so although I was standing around at the desks for 5 minutes, someone else that just walked straight up pretending they didn't see me was served first. I asked staff if I was waiting in the wrong spot but they said there is no queue and would be next. Then someone else tried to push in front of me, the staff member told them I was next. Given this happened to me twice in the 5-10 minutes I was waiting I am guessing it would be an ongoing issue - I think clear signage is needed for people to queue up. I didn't wait long and not a big deal but annoying for people that wait their turn.2. I booked and paid in full through a third party around 4 days before I was staying at this hotel. When I was checking in I was asked for ID and a credit card. I assumed, (as all hotels do) they were holding a token amount on my card. The lady checking us in whipped it out of my hand and swiped it through the machine in .5 of a second. I asked what amount she was holding and she advised the entire accommodation cost. I asked why given I have paid already and she stated she did not know I had paid and asked for my evidence, which I showed. Then when I said she has now used up the entire credit left on my credit card, she stated I should have told her I had paid already and this would not have happened. So apparently it was my fault that she wrongly charged my card leaving me with no credit, which took over one week to reverse. While I had cash and another card (that I didn't want to use), many people would have been caught short by her doing this. Staff should be clarifying with customers what they are charging the card for before swiping it though taking incorrect amounts. Also don't blame customers, why would I think you were charging my card for a room I had paid for.The staff member said she will get the manager to look at it and stop the payment. No-one followed up with me to tell me what had happened. I had to follow up at the desk the next day to see if had been stopped.3. The rooms were big enough for 2 adults and 1 kid, clean and tidy and I like having the separate lounge area.4. The breakfast was pretty good, some of the food (bacon) was rock hard and gross but the omelettes were nice and there was plenty of choices. Yogurts, fruit, pastries etc. The coffee was not nice. Overall I thought the breakfast was really good. 5. The nightly drinks and food: (the food consisted of carrot sticks or broccoli and dip, chips and goldfish biscuits and some pretzel mix) The beer was fine, the mai tais were fine, the blue cocktail was way to sweet and the scotch and coke (very crap scotch, I could not drink). The first night there was one staff member serving (who was super quick) but massive queues. There was one other person in the bar with him pretty much doing nothing, not sure why he was there. The second night and third night there were two staff actually working and the queues moved quicker. The band on one of the nights was great and it made the night much more fun. 6. The pool area was good, not many seats but there always seem to be some available and the whole area was really nice.7. There was a sign left in our room to say there were going to be renovations during the stay. This was obvious when we were in our room and could hear a very loud buzzing noise. No mention of this prior to booking of course.Overall I felt this place was fine, would I come back if I got a great deal, yep, but it would have to be super cheap, I would not pick it over other places I have stayed, just because of the little things.","Melbourne, Australia","WonderWilma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",57,3.0

Our party consisted of my parents, my brothers family and mine all caught up for 10 days, flying in from various parts of Australia, ten of us in total with kids ranging from 3 - 11.The hotel is situated across the road from the Beach. The hotel itself is a little 'dated' in comparison with other hotels. This is in regards to the furnishings in the rooms etc... Although some would see this as a negative, this worked out to be a blessing in disguise. The rooms are bigger and gave a little more space when the kids wanted to finish up for the day and just 'relax on the bed'. The pool area was a huge hit for the entire family. It was the right depth for the 'littler kids. Which put at ease the parents (myself included). This really came alive in the happy hour sessions from 5:30 - 7:30.

Another big reason for our booking was the bed configurations. We were in a 2/Queen + sofa bed city view room. The sofa bed was terrible, saggy old foam mattress. Thankfully my 12yr old weighs next-to-nothing so didn't complain. No way would my 14yr old or adult been able to sleep on it. The beds in the bedroom. One was OK (just ok), the other was terrible and we kept rolling into the middle. I do have back issues, so this really impacted my stay here and in hindsight, I wish I'd said something whilst I was there.I've given my review a 4-star rating due to the poor beds and subsequent poor sleep quality.","Sydney, Australia","iluv2travelSydney</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",24,4.0

So we decided to stay here again. The breakfast was fantastic like last year. However, the lines are a lot longer and because of the rain which left the outdoor tables and chairs wet, we couldn't find a place to sit. I managed to find a towel and whipped down the tables and chairs. Not sure why the servers weren't doing that! This year, the hotel was at 97% occupancy when we arrived - pool was so crowded, I didn't even make it to the jacuzzi (we were there for 7 days). We had a pool-side, partial ocean view room on the 10th floor and it was noisy! We've been going to Hawaii for the past 10+ years, and this is the only hotel where I felt the staff was less than welcoming. The cleaning lady didn't even say good morning/aloha to us but asked bluntly ""do you want your room cleaned?"" The staff at breakfast was also less than friendly (aside from one ). The other annoying change that happened this year is they added more ""cabanas"" in the swimming area but they decided to charge for them. That just makes me mad. The hotel is not cheap. We paid $350+ a night and you're going to nickel and dime us? That just felt cheap and left a bad taste in my mouth.

The location of the hotel is perfect (I used to stay there when it was the Coral Seas YEARS ago), close to the beach and lots of shops and restaurants.

You can't beat sitting out at night, sipping on your free drink, munching on free snacks and meeting travelers from all over the world. Great atmosphere. The ONLY con I would have is that, though the band is AMAZING, the music is SO loud that it made it very hard to talk to these other travelers. You'd have to wait until they were in between songs to talk. If they could keep the volume down just a touch, it would make the evenings absolutely perfect.

Had many take photos of me & probably on lots of Instagrams but that’s ok. So long as I had fun and quite a few joined me in dancing once I opened the floor! =) .

The suites are large and you don’t feel you are in a box with beds, they have two balconies all with a stunning view of city and ocean. The breakfast is well organized and with a large variety of things to make sure to keep you full for most of the day and the afternoon snack is a nice treat. If you are renting a car you can go through enterprise and pickup is just across the street at Outrigger, you can drop off at the embassy for an additional $5, we rented a car for two days and instead of doing one rental paying $40 for overnight parking we did two separate rentals which turned out cheaper. The pool area was rarely busy and when it was it was never crowded.Jay at the front desk is a big asset to the company, he understand customer service and how to make customers feel special, this goes for the rest of the staff at the pool area and our room attendant, they were all so nice. Susanna at the front desk on the other hand could use a bit of training on how the hospitality industry works and how to treat people.

They took our bags, which was still available to us to get changed into more comfortable/appropriate clothing.The Hotel has a buffet breakfast with a reasonable variety of food and some made to order omelettes, a couple of varieties of coffee, juices etc which a lot of other hotels don’t have.During the evening the Hotel has the ‘Managers Reception’, which is a couple of hours of free poolside drinks, where there is a variety of beers, cocktails and spirits which are all free. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday you also get free entertainment during these drinks from an awesome local Hawaiian band (Kanilau) doing a variety of cover songs.

It’s well located, in the heart of everything good in Waikiki…… Restaurants, shopping, beaches.The rooms are well catered, spacious, clean and comfortable. The beds are adequately comfortable, with a couple of different pillows to choose from.

We love the location, the breakfast buffet and happy hour, the pool and the staff is always friendly and kind. We heard this year that management of the hotel has recently changed and we can notice a difference this trip. The most visual difference: the pool area has new furniture and cabanas for rent. And there are renovations being done to the towers. The rooms also have changed. Little things like no more pool towels in the bathroom, less bath towels available in the room, overall cleanliness of the rooms isn’t the same - it doesn’t seem to be as clean as it used to be. We don’t blamed the staff as we see them working hard and trying their best to accommodate our requests. The staff also has a lovely attitude and are super friendly. To us, it is obvious that the management is trying to save costs. As we have stayed at the hotel many times, we have noticed the little changes. And the little things sometimes make a huge difference.I hope that during the renovations and transition with the changes, the hotel works out where to cut costs and how to still provide a great place to stay.We would still come back for our family trips and stay at this hotel.

We have stayed in numerous hotels on Waikiki over the last twenty plus years we have lived on Oahu; in doing so we have seen most levels of accomodation available. This property is well priced and central to the attractions found in the Waikiki Beach area. It is situated in the Beachwalk shops shops, less than five minute walk from the Royal Hawaiian Arcade shops/restaurants and roughly a ten minute walk from the International market place. Unlike most Embassy Suites there is no central enclosed atrium where the evening reception and morning breakfast are offered. On this property the reception and breakfast is on the 4th floor between the two hotel towers in close proximity to the outdoor pool. On Saturday evening the hotel has live entertainment for your listening pleasure while attending the manger's reception. The breakfast offerings are suitable for both an American and multi-national clientel. There is more than adequate seating for both events. The front area (bell hops, valets and front desk) personnel are polite and efficient. The check in process is well rehearsed and quick. The rooms are slighly smaller than mainland Embassy Suites yet comfortable. Our suite offered us two balconies with two seats and a small table overrlooking the pool. The room was quiet.","Honolulu, Hawaii","Susan N Bill S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",73,4.0

Other positives included the breakfast & location. The housekeeping staff were also excellent, with great knowledge & care.However, do not get a room near the elevator. Staff pretend there is no issue with elevator noise at night and in the morning, but it is widely spoken about among guests at the bar and pool. Soundproofing is clearly not something the hotel cares to invest in. After a sleepless night due to the elevator, I was thankfully moved to another room, for which I am thankful. It beggars belief that these rooms are made available.I also found that some staff (not all) were curt and a little rude. This does not apply to the housekeeping staff. It seems front of house and bell desk staff did not want to be there.Bar staff were lovely, but it should be noted that there are no poolside attendants to enforce rules, especially as children dangerously jump into the pool.","Melbourne, Australia","Ben_Parks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",23,3.0

These three gracious ladies are always extremely pleasantly accommodating, and willing to go to the proverbial ""extra mile"" for you. The rooms are all suites, and have the luxury of a separate living room. Wake up in the morning, and enjoy the included full breakfast with made to order omelets, and local staples of rice and miso soup. The complimentary evening cocktail reception with live music is a great way to end your day. A few years ago, I hosted 17 suites for a birthday overnighter, with a private reception in the Beach Walk banquet room. The reception was a great success, thanks to Shantel, who followed through with every detail. I just checked out yesterday after two nights from the Embassy Suites Waikiki, and was happy to see that Shantel is in charge of F&B. She's a wonderful asset to the property - I can see why the breakfast buffet and evening reception have maintained their consistent level of service and quality over the years.

Great family feel around the hotel, note that this place is full of kids so if you're looking for a quiet romantic break away then this isn't the place for you.We were lucky enough to get into our room having arrived at 8am, check in isn't until 3pm and we had a small toddler with us. We appreciated this gesture and pass on our thanks. The Not So Good:No plates or cutlery within the rooms which seems very strange when there's a small kitchenette. It became a pain having to call down to have plastic plates/cutlery delivered to the room.Charging for shade umbrellas at the pool, absolutely ridiculous to cash in on the safety of families staying at the resort by charging $30 for shade from the blistering sun - Hilton take note and do the right thing. Lifts and proximity to the rooms. We stayed in room 1811 and our relatives stayed 1901 and both rooms are next to the lifts which run all night and are noisy.

Not at all!To our great surprise, Victor, a Reception Associate, checked us in, gave us our key and check-in package, and we were good to go! We had asked for a nice location, and despite it being so early in the morning, Victor was able to give us a room on the 7th floor with a lovely view. So many high-rise hotels in the area can make having a view problematic, but Victor found us a great room.Minutes after we had checked in, Victor texted us, asking about the room, etc, and indicating that we should get in touch with him should we need anything else. A first for us when it comes to checking in at hotels! He also texted the next day, asking after our enjoyment of Honolulu. Again, a first with any hotel stay we have had. We have stayed at many, many Embassy Suites in our frequent travels because of the value for your dollar, the free breakfasts, and the evening Manager Specials. However, I have to say that this particular location is the BEST of the Embassy Suites that we have experienced. The breakfast offerings are exceptional, with many varied items on the menu to better accommodate the many varied guests of the hotel.

Place is packed with kids!Especially watch out for Australian school holidays, which we weren't aware of while booking. Kids will take over the pool that is already too small for the size of the hotel.But overall we really enjoyed staying there.Pros:Great location, handy to beach, shops, buses.FREE breakfast that includes cooked eggs any style (omelettes too), bacon, sausage, fruits, grains, etc.FREE cocktails, beers, and soft drinks from 5:30pm to 7:30pm EVERY NIGHT, along with snack food.Great sized suites, with separate lounge/living room with plenty seating and a table.Comfy bedsFriendly staff ConsToo many kids.Small pool (and deepest point is 4ft).Breakfast, bar, and pool are on the 4th floor making it a bit of a hassle to get to and from shops and beach, and elevators can be pretty busy around popular times of day.No poolside service as far as we could tell. (which can be a blessing for some)Not enough lounge chairs/umbrellas by the pool. This is partly because they have these Cabanas and bigger beds that you can pay for the day that take 3 times the space of regular beds (we didn't see anyone rent these, and I think it's appalling to have that many of them occupying all the space while guests are scrambling to find a spot). To sum it up. Don't go there for a ""Romantic getaway"" or a sophisticated experience.

First, the upper management was very responsive and kind to a request that we had regarding a late check out. Mr. Miranda, Mr. Otsuka, and Mr. Robinson, all responded to our email which blew me and my husband away. I know these men have busy schedules so it was even more astounding that they answered us within minutes to a few hours. Customer service seems to be a thing of the past but these gentlemen are bringing back high standards. Mr. Otsuka even arranged for us to have a key to hang out at the hotel while we waited for transportation to the airport. Our flight did not leave until 9:00 p.m. and he saved us from hanging out at the airport for a long period. While Hawaii is beautiful, the airport harks back to 1960. Check in at the hotel was very easy and reception was actually aware of our late check out so that went smooth. The same with check out. No issues with giving us a key to hang out until we left for the airport. As someone who travels quite a bit, when everything goes smooth, it is always a delight. The management at the Hampton in Seattle (see my review for that) may need to see the blueprint this administration has in their handbook. The breakfast buffet had an amazing selection. I know some people thought the food was bland but when you are serving that many people it is easier for the guest to add salt/spices than to make something that may not appeal to those who have issues with certain additives. Also, you can have an omelet made to your specifications. The hotel has nice amenities. There is a manager’s reception with free beer and soda, as well as some snacks, a laundry room if you need to freshen up your clothes, a very nice swimming pool, valet service, and you can even drop off your rental care from Enterprise at the hotel. The rental car company closes early so this was a welcome feature. I know I am missing some things but I encourage anyone to stay here. It will start and end your holiday/vacation in all the right ways.Words cannot do our housekeeper Yuat (hope I spelled this right) justice. Our room was very clean and she fulfilled a few requests for us. Also, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention this woman has skills and speed!

The AC worked very well; it was really nice to come back to a very cold room after being in the sun on the beach. The complimentary breakfast was excellent, but I thought the evening reception food and snacks was just okay. Our rooms were on the fourth floor, which is where the pool is located and where the complimentary breakfast and evening reception are also located.

Shower caps, cutlery, mugs, wine glasses and crockery of any sort isn’t provided (why have a microwave if you don’t provide any of the basics to go with it?). When we checked in, there were only 2 towels even though there were 4 of us (annoying after a long flight when you just want to have a shower right away).The managers nightly reception with the free drinks was appreciated and sets this hotel apart in terms of value for money.The pool was extremely crowded and there weren’t enough pool chairs.Breakfast was a nightmare. There were long queues (didn’t even bother with the omelette station after the first day) and not enough tables. The food was the same almost every day and not enjoyable.Location is fantastic - walking distance to everything.We love Hilton hotels but probably wouldn’t stay at this one again.

The two-room suite was perfect for this, as we could close the door when the kids were sleeping and still chat and relax in the living room area. Having a microwave in addition to the mini fridge was great as well, for heating up left overs. Even the coffee makers was good. The staff was super friendly for the most part, especially housekeeping and at breakfast.The breakfast was pretty good, a kicked-up hotel breakfast with both cold and hot items. I had rice and miso soup every morning we ate there, along with salad. Nice and light. There are tons of birds bothering people at the tables outside, but they open up the meeting rooms so we were able to eat sans birds. We didn't really do the happy hour, just a few snacks but we didn't want to drink so that part was a wash.The location is fantastic. A block away from the beach and crossing Kalia was much easier than the larger block most hotels are across from. The beach right there is rocky but pretty, but if you walk down to the Hilton Hawaiian Village past the dock, the beach there is without rocks and calm. Oh, and definitely do that walk at sunset. Simply stunning and absolutely free. The pool got super crowded later in the day. It's small (although large for Waikiki apparently) but it has a little kid area and a hot tub. The area around the pool was very nice and had a tropical feel although it was on the fourth floor.The only negatives were:Wi-fi was awful. Not a big deal for us but if you need to do work on business you will need your own hotspot. No business center to speak of (they closed it) just some computers in the hot lobby area. Fine for us to print our boarding passes but again if you need to do business, you will need another option.Also they assign rooms before check-in. We had to wait until 3, which fine that is the check-in time but even then the room wasn't ready. After all those calls we made to check on the room, at past 3 when we went back they said, Oh housekeeping still has to clean your room. What? On the phone they said it was guaranteed for three at the latest. We had pants from the flight and large electronics bag that we didn't want to check. My 7 year old was hot and sweaty and in tears, and I got upset as well, so they magically found us another room that was ready. There is no airconditioned space to wait. No lockers for valuables so you can change and swim, etc. while you are waiting. Apparently they assign you a room, and that's your room, and even if there are tons of rooms available in the class you booked, you wait for your specific assigned room. If they gave the previous guests in that room late check-out, you have to wait. Again, overall not a huge deal and I do highly recommend this hotel, but this is one area that can be improved upon.",New York,"Cancun_curious</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York</strong>",99,5.0

However, this is my go to place that provides that AND the staff! Where do I begin? The happy hour staff is great- making it happier whether it's pineapple juice being dispensed by a ""pineapple"" or a mai tai. During the first evening there, the bartenders, Keola (he's going to be mad if I spelled his name wrong?) and Shan, made sure we were remembered as they poured all 9 of us our usual drinks. Also, our breakfast omelets and egg preferences were remembered and served with a lot fun by John and Dominic. Servers Cary and Aldrin always made our large party of 9 feel accommodated. Their newest add is Keala, one of the runners during happy hour. She is such a character and striked the right balance of professionalism and humor! The only downside to this trip was expecting our usual valet staff that always provided recommendations for our next adventure. Most of their staff looked new, but life does go on and it's certainly understandable to support career growth and aspirations- We miss Gilbert!

It was nice to be able to head out to the Beachwalk from the lobby area.From the minute we arrived, Cindy at Reception welcomed us with a smile and complimentary juice which was a yummy treat in the afternoon heat. She was very helpful and let us know when we could head up to our room. The room was perfect for our family. We had plenty of space to put away our kids' clothing and have the suitcases out of the way. We had 2 Queen beds in a bedroom and a sofa bed in the main area. The small kitchenette area was a bonus, with a large countertop area, small sink, microwave and mini fridge. The view out of our 14th floor windows was beautiful. We looked out over the pool area and could see the ocean in between the Halekulani and Outrigger hotels directly in front. The amenities offered at the Embassy Suites are superb! The morning breakfast had something for everyone. Definitely better than your typical continental breakfast. In addition to fruit, yogurts, breads, and an oatmeal and cereal bar, they offered a lovely green salad and made to order omelettes and eggs. This was our family favorite. The lines tended to be a little long, but worth the wait. Dominic was always so friendly to our family, smiling, joking, even getting our teenager to smile in the morning! And his omelettes were the best. He also made the best over medium eggs that I had during our stay. Thank you Dominic! Another awesome amenity is their evening Happy Hour down by the pool. They always had a fresh veggie option as well as crackers, chips, and occasionally nachos. The bartender happily made our family Virgin Mai Tais and Shirley Temples. This was the best way to wind down after a day of sightseeing, or visiting the beach, the kids would swim, grab a snack and be ready to rest. The pool area was small, but very enjoyable. Our kids loved swimming and would spend hours playing together. If I had to find a con I would say the elevators could be a little tricky at certain times. There were many times we would have to pass up 3 or 4 elevators that were full before we could get into one. We were never in a hurry so this didn't dampen our stay at all. I cannot say enough positive things about our stay at the Embassy Suites. The staff was helpful and friendly at every turn. They even gave our daughter a coloring book that she enjoyed throughout our stay. If you have a large family, or just want a little extra space on your Hawaii vacation, look no further.

This was made special by the employees, like Michael and Dominic preparing omelettes or Rose distributing kids books with crayons .Ending the day with the Manager’s Hosted Reception (5:30pm-7:30pm) with FREE DRINKS and snacks, from beer to delicious Mai-Tais or Blue Hawaii ... While the children play in a shallow pool (4 ft on the deeper side) Mommy and Daddy get their drinks and chips and talk whatever they want, just watching the kids swimming. AWESOME DESIGN! You could tell so by the parents walking around with their BIG SMILES in the morning and in the afternoon. Worth the rate of $329 per night!  TIPS:- Bathroom got clogged about 3 times, I think it’s because everyone brings sand from the beach . TIP: Wash as much as you can in the public beach. - Wi-Fi is bad. Internet is much slower in Hawai’i as well. TIP: Pre-load what you need in your device or print if needed.- ️ Public Parking around Waikiki is EXPENSIVE. TIP: You’re better off with the Valet service ($40 per day), you’ll notice when you leave your car in the capable hands of Calvin or Abre.- TIP: Refill your water bottles in the only filtered water machine there is, in the Aloha tower, right behind the reception.- TIP: Somehow Tuesday seemed very slow and Friday very busy.- The pool and breakfast area are on the 4th floor and you’ll want to get to them quickly. TIP: Register with Hilton Honors (their loyalty program) and download their App to choose your room as close as possible to the 4th floor and if possible in the Hula Tower (Close access to Big Wave Dave Surf & Coffee, Poké Bar, Ruth Chris and many more stores!)The only issue we had is that the A/C unit ❄️ thermostat didn’t work in one of the rooms but the temperature was SO COMFORTABLE that we didn’t bother to report it.#ruizmedina⭐️ ","Portland, Oregon","baltaruiz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",19,5.0

The one bedroom suite on the 16th floor was nice but seemed a little smaller than Embassy Suites on the mainland. Although we had a street view room, the rooms were very quiet except for during the drum performances during a festival in the plaza and the fireworks. We were not able to hear any of our neighbors or the elevator which we were near. The hotel was close to many restaurants, shopping and the beach. It was also nice that you had to use your room key to use the elevator so they were a bit quicker.The breakfasts were good and they had a good variety of foods such as made to order omelettes, pancakes, breakfast meats, fruit, oatmeal, cold cereal, rice, miso soup with fixings, and pastries. There was also a variety of juices, flavored 0 calorie water, coffees and teas. Although the breakfast was good, it did get a little boring by about the sixth day and I was disappointed waffles were not offered. They did offer french toast one day which was good and biscuits and gravy on another day that I don't eat. I hadn't been to Oahu since the 1980's so a lot has changed.

It is not that far from the airport but with traffic, it probably takes 20-25 minutes depending on the time of day. As with all Embassy suites, it has a fantastic breakfast which is served outside and makes it taste even better! The happy hour was the best I have been to. On one night, they had a band playing which was very nice. There is a wide variety of tropical drinks. They have 7 a.m. yoga by the pool which was awesome. This hotel is close to many shops and restaurants. The only complaint, if I had to find something, is that they only have valet parking and it is $40 but I think this is pretty typical for the area.

The price was well over $300 per night, but I decided it would be worth it. IT WAS NOT!The reception area is big, but not really welcoming. The front desk, while they offer a welcome fruit juice, don’t help you get a good layout of what the hotel has and where those things are. The room was clean, but absolutely a standard basic room that you can find at the cheapest motels.I did have a view of the pool and the ocean, which was nice. However it also looks out to the adjacent hotel and their rooms and balconies.Do not be lured by the free breakfast and free happy hour unless you are with young children and/ or on a serious budget. First these both take place in an area next to the pool. It’s feels like a cafeteria from elementary school, not only because of the trays and the lines, but the amount of screaming children. It was incredibly loud and the opposite of the intent of my relaxing vacation. There is a omelet station, but it took forever and there was no flavor to any of it. The rest is just industrial food from a convenience store. Oh and don’t forget all of the birds that are looking to eat off the floor and your table!The happy hour is free and includes well drinks that I think they are watering down with below well alcohol. My drink was both very strong and terrible. The booze was disgusting. If you just want t get drunk, this is the place. If you want a good drink, go elsewhere.The pool is small and overrun with screaming children.The gym is very small with a handful of treadmill items, a pulley weight set, a few benches, a few dumbbells, a couple of medicine balls and a couple of mats. There is no view. I would not recommend this hotel at all. It’s far to expensive for a basic hotel. If you have kids and you all can handle the noise, the birds, the bad food and bad drinks in order to save you from finding food elsewhere...maybe.","Portland, Oregon","austria313</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",60,2.0

There were a couple things that they could improve on.We have been to Maui many times and this vacation decided to stay in Oahu. This hotel was great for our time there. The pool is nice not to big but decent for our pool days. It would be nice if there were more seats with umbrellas to get some shade.The room was nice we had a separate seating area. We stayed in room 532 and it had a great view of the pool and the Friday night fireworks. The a/c in the sitting area was really good and kept the room cool. The one in the bedroom stopped working so maintenance came up and fixed it.Check in was good. It was nice they brought out juice for us. And we got there early so they were very kind to find us a room. but we feel like they could pump some Hawaiian fragrance into their lobby and hallways because of the area you can smell food all the time. We really enjoyed the beach walk area. It was so convenient to go out for food and shopping. The ABC store at the back of the hotel is one of the biggest we have ever seen.

On several nights of the week there is also a fabulous band with a chap who I am quite sure could be the best ukulele player in the world! The crowd stood up and cheered each time he played!6.There is a huge choice at the complimentary breakfast with something to satisfy even the fussiest members of the family. The omelettes are cooked to order and are really delicious. Breakfast can be busy though and I could see that at peak times some families struggled to find an empty table.7.Every single member of staff we encountered was polite, helpful, welcoming and smiling!The Bad Points...1. Do not bother with a corner suite. We paid extra for one but soon discovered by looking at the hotel floor plan on the back of the room door that three out of the four corner suites on the floor are smaller than normal suites as they have a big chunk taken out of the room to accommodate the hotel fire escape. Am pretty sure that this would be the case on all floors. As a result, our family of 4 felt a little squashed, as once the sofa was made into a bed for the children there was very little space left. We had to ask for some of the other furniture in the room (coffee tables and chairs) to be removed and even then it was impossible to walk all the way around the sofa bed. This was such a shame and did spoil our enjoyment of the room. It was however, very nice to have different views from different balconies but definitely not worth the extra cost.2. The kitchen in the suite was really useless. There was no cutlery or plates provided, just a corkscrew. The fridge was good for cooling drinks but we never used the microwave and there was not enough worktop space to even prepare a sandwich. We had planned to prepare food and eat in the room some nights but this was impossible.3. We made the mistake of booking the 'premium' option which I had assumed was for a larger or better suite but it turned out was just for a daily supply of fizzy drinks and snacks. I paid well over the odds for this and really regret it.4. Most nights we slept well but on a couple of the nights we could hear traffic noise from the street below, even though we were on the 17th floor.

As a result though, the good and bad is that this hotel caters particularly to groups of friends and to families with small children. I enjoyed the pool area that had enough lounge-chairs for everybody. The all-inclusive breakfast and happy-hour drinks were good additions to start and end the day, respectively, not requiring us to go out. However, the breakfast food and happy-hour drinks were practically the same every day. That aside, as one of six travelers, I was pleased to eat breakfast inside the hotel and have drinks right next to the pool area in the late afternoon. The only downside to the happy hour was the music that was TOO loud, so loud that we had difficulty talking together at our table. I suggest the music be turned town to make the happy hour more enjoyable. We sat the furthest away from the band but the music still overpowered our conversations. I highly recommend the Embassy Suites to travelers in groups of 4, 5 or 6 who want to share one room and be together.

The complimentary breakfast was a bonus, with a variety of things to eat. In the evenings we enjoyed the band - what energy and talent! the free drinks and nibbles during the two hour happy hour were really great as well.The hotel is only a short walk from the beach at Fort de Russy park - much quieter and more sand than central Waikiki.The only thing we would have liked would have been basic items in the kitchen like cutlery and crockery.

My favourite interactions were with the extremely friendly housekeeping and breakfast buffet staff. Thank you! The only downside to this hotel is that it is dated for the price. Although the rooms are a good size they could benefit from updates and some areas have a musky odour. If you have children with allergies, consider asking for a room without musky odour or find another hotel. There was also some construction in the area (not in the hotel specifically). If still ongoing, I recommend a room on a higher floor and away from the main street, if possible. The location is excellent and within walking distance to shopping, restaurants and beach.

I can recommend it and would stay here again. I thought I would provide a review of the evening reception as I did not find very clear information on it when I checked earlier reviews.The evening reception is from 5:30-7:30 and is free for everyone staying in the hotel. During the reception certain drinks are free. These include 8 specific cocktails, several spirits and simple mix drinks such as gin and tonic, and beer and wine. There are also free drinks for kids such as cola and sprite, as well as snacks. The snack rotate each night. Chips and pretzels, and a veggie one night and nuts, corn chips, and veggies the other. In terms of what is provided, it is very nice and in a great location near the pool.The highlight of the evening reception though is the band, which is excellent. They play four days a week, Mon, Wed, Fri, and Saturday, and always put on a good show. They play classic pop songs but with unique arrangements and with ukelele as the lead instrument. They have really strong vocals and play tight sets. They are very professional, very engaging, and I found were perhaps the best reason to come to the reception. I have seen them play 6 times now, and my family still wants to come and see them play, as do I. Having stayed in Hawaii five times now, I can say that they are by far the best band that I have seen play. This is reflected by the audience appreciation. The embassy is lucky to have them.Overall the evening reception is a nice time and a great way to start the evening.

The location cannot be beat. Theres a starbucks downstairs, the beach is just a mere short walk in one direction and the touristy shops of waikiki is a short walk in the other direction. The first time we stayed here was with a hiltons honors member so they upgraded us to a room on one of the top floors. the view was absolutely amazing!! Could not get enough of those ocean views. The room was large and spacious, very clean and although not brand new was new and clean enough for me. Housekeeping did a great job getting rid of all the sand in the room at the end of the day and we always came back to a nice tidy room. The complimentary breakfast is a really good solid meal! Not your avg cheap free meal. The fruit is abundant and fresh, the make your own omelette station is very filling. The pool is kind of small, but then with the beach such a short walk away I could see why they didnt waste money on the pool area (although its still a very nice and well maintained area). The workers are very nice, especially the valet people. valet only is a pain in the butt at times but the workers are fast, efficient and very nice so its hard to complain. I loved my stay so much the following year when I came back to hawaii for another vacation I had to choose the same hotel again! We didnt get the complimentary upgrade this time since we were not travelling with any honors member (too bad) but the room was still nice, although i must admit the rooms on the higher levels boast a better view and are much more quiet. Our room this time was a little loud due to higher traffic from other people. Its more pricey than other hotels but its certainly my favorite and I wouldnt hesitate to book another stay!",,dexx07,1,5.0

So we sucked it up and stayed in our room. I ended up playing some white noise on my phone all night to drown out the elevator noise.

There is a Starbucks across the way at the Outrigger Reef and also Cafe Glace on Lewers Street has breakfast items - but limited table space.

This might be a good choice if you want to stay by the pool.We were able to go to the beach and rent beach loungers in front of the Outrigger Reef Hotel. The beach front at that section is somewhat tricky for swimming as it has more coral and several cut downs.

I have probably experienced about 20 stays here since this property opened. Rooms: Spacious, clean and well maintained. Nearly all the rooms offer a nice view - most of the rooms offer some glimpse of the ocean. This property has held up really well over the years. They stock the rooms with beach towels, which is great.Service: Outstanding - everyone from the Bellman, to the desk staff, to the cleaning people are full of aloha and tremendously friendly and helpful.Food: Best Embassy suites breakfast offering both standard American Embassy Suites breakfast, but always with local/Japanese options as well. They also regularly have terrific local fruit offerings like pinapple and on occassion, papaya. Breakfast is really crowded so pay attention to the literature in your room on peak periods for breakfast. Even during peak times though, the staff do a decent job of keeping things moving. The service staff are tremendously efficient and courteous in constantly clearing plates and making space. Beverage station has a great selection of tropical juices. Location: This property is 1 block from the beach, and away from the craziness of Kalakaua St. It is fairly serene by Waikiki standards. Lots of really great dining options nearby on both the Waikiki Beachwalk and Royal Hawaii Shopping Center, both of which are a block away. There is an extra large ABC store across the street that has great hot food service and a deli, along with the usual ABC store souvenirs and sundry items. Amenities: Average fitness center with a dumbell rack and lots of cardio machines. Extra large outdoor pool which has a lot of kids. Getting poolside lounge chairs can be a challenge during peak periods. I generally do not partake in Embassy Suites cocktail hours but it is really popular and they seemed to have a good snack selection.","San Francisco, California","LawrenceJ828</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",11,5.0

The location is great, very central, and since we didn't rent a car, uber was very accessible. Breakfast was included, and was tasty once you could access it (I understand Christmas is a busy time). The pool was nice, just a lot of children who splashed water in our drinks as we tried to enjoy the afternoon reception. Not blaming the hotel, more lack of parental supervision (again, busy Christmas week). Biggest issue with this hotel is lack of elevators. Only 2 elevators in main building for 22 floors of guest rooms, several times we had to wait after the elevator reached our floor but was too full to use.

I may be spoiled, but I give this property a C-. I list our pros and cons below:Pros: They did have a suite available that fit our family of 6 (albeit tightly). We didn't want to split up into separate rooms, and suites are not easy to find in the heart of Waikiki.We could see the ocean from our room, but our view was partially obstructed by buildings (in spite of paying for a full ocean view room)Location - this property is in the heart of the action, walking distance to the beach, Starbucks, and the Waikiki Beach Walk Shops and Restaurants. This is the hotel's best feature.Generous breakfast buffet (with cooked to order omelets) and happy hour reception nightly at the pool at 5:30-7:30 is included and offers good value for filling up your family without additional expense. Cons:Check in was chaotic and staff seemed frazzled but they did their best. We were offered fresh juice at check in, but the staff was less warm than we expected for our first taste of Waikiki. The best staff members were the bell captain and valet guys. This place was is LOUD - it was packed with families with little kids (maybe not so much if you don't come during Christmas like we did). If you like the hustle and bustle of Times Square or Disney Cruises, you will probably love it but I found the pool and common areas less than peaceful. I escaped to the Outrigger's Starbucks each morning at 5am for some peace and quiet. People are everywhere.Someone pulled an alarm in the middle of the night! That's not the management's fault, necessarily, but they made loud announcements in multiple languages to let guests know there was no fire. Each room received an apology letter the next day. I know they did their best, but I couldn't wait to leave that place.Small pool and fitness center for the number of guests using it. Maybe that's the norm in Waikiki?Maybe it's me, but this place just did not wow me - especially at more than $900 a night! It was a rough start to our Hawaiian vacation.

The free breakfast buffet exceeded our expectations. It was a huge selection with hot and cold items, made to order omelets, pancakes/waffles, bacon/sausage, etc. The location at the heart of Waikiki is a short 3 min walk from the beach and tons of restaurants are nearby. We thought being off-beach might be a hassle but quite the contrary! The value was outstanding for what we got here--big room, free hot breakfast, free evening cocktail reception, great pool/hot tub, nice gym, etc. The hotel charges a high (but normal for the area) $40/night for parking (valet only, no self parking available). However, that is easily offset by the fact that they don't charge the typical $25-50/night ""resort fees"" like all the other full-service properties around Waikiki, We would definitely stay here again in the future.","Dallas, Texas","GrantWalsh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",53,5.0

And again, their free, all you can drink happy hour with snacks is unbelievable and much appreciated at the end of a long day in the sun. The service is amazing. A special shout out to Resty, Rodrigo and Aldrin who always welcomed us with a smile and, even though it's a self-serve buffet, always came around to see if we needed anything and if there was anything they could bring us. They made the stay all that much more enjoyable. This time we lucked out with a room overlooking the pool and we also had a view of the ocean, the beach and Fort DeRussey park. The room was great, we went with my parents and the four of us so they had the room with the king bed, one of our sons slept on the hide-a-bed in the living room and my husband and I and our other son shared the 2 queen bed room. Two bathrooms were very welcome. This time round our cleaning staff wasn't quite as thorough as the ones we had last time as sand was still left in the bathroom and other small things like that, nothing that ruined our trip. We rented a vehicle this time and kept it at the hotel and the valet service was great. The ONLY big complaint we had was that the wifi is horrible. I was trying to check our email and send pictures which proved to be quite a chore but again, nothing that would ruin our trip. All in all another great stay. Would definitely come back.

The free buffet breakfast and the managers reception saved me upwards of $1000 over the duration of our 10 night stay.

Decided to switch from Hilton Hawaiian Village as we had 3 kids and were able to secure a 1 bedroom here. Emailed hotel beforehand and they upgraded us to a 2 bedroom, which was amazing as 2 of our kids are under 3 years old. The rooms weren't that big, but more than adequate. Free breakfast was a huge plus, and the pool has a small little kid's section where my 2 year olds could stand, which was great for them. Loved the free happy hour each night as well. It was a lot of Hilton Points at 70K a night (I believe it's even higher now at 75K), but in the end we definitely got our moneys worth. No resort fee either which was nice. 1 block from the beach, so very close walk. Also close to shops, pharmacy, etc. Would definitely return. Be warned, parking is expensive here (as is everywhere in Waikiki) - I think it was $38 or $40/night, and I'm sure it's only gone up since then.","Teaneck, New Jersey","yoshapman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Teaneck, New Jersey</strong>",124,5.0

It’s a very nice hotel, especially for families. We booked the two queen bed suite, which actually comes with an additional sofa bed in the hall. This allows for some privacy and space for a larger group of people. Most hotels in Honolulu do not include breakfast when you book the rooms. This hotel does. It’s said to be a “made to order” breakfast. What is actually made here is your eggs, whether it’s the sunny side up or omelette. The rest (yogurt, fruits, soup, coffee and juices) are available buffet style. The crowd in the breakfast area can be overwhelming, and guests are notified about this in the room. A rough “traffic” guide is mentioned based on the time of the day.There is an additional meal with the room, which is the daily manager’s reception between 6.30 to 8.30 pm. This is a poolside reception with cocktails and light bites. On certain days, there is a band that plays good music. This is a good way to wind down after an outing and then have dinner later, if needed. The reception counter is good, and check-in smooth. However, as in most 5-star hotels, it’s a bit impersonal. Nobody really notes your movements in and out. Laundry service is available at the 3rd floor with dryer services as well, all at a good rate. The beach is about a 5 minute walk from the hotel. Guests are allowed to borrow towels from the pool area and return it later. The pool is not very big, but adequate. It has a wading pool and a jacuzzi. There is a “travel” counter at the entrance. I would like to mention that this “travel” counter isn’t very good. Sorry guys, but I have to say this. When I asked for shuttle services to Waikele, they were not very helpful. This when actually, there is a shuttle service at the Royal Hawaiian Avenue, which I noted a few days later. When I asked about car rental, the person in-charge was trying to sell me a whole day tour.

I was very disappointed to find our room was the one behind the lifts (632) but don't like complaining so stuck it out.The first night was fine as we were very tired but after that most nights were a constant rumble of lift noise - kind of like a distant thunder storm. Maybe I should have requested a move?The room was very clean and we had a great view over the pool deck. It was a little disappointing to find no kitchen utensils except 2 glasses and 2 cups. With the small kitchen in the room it would have been nice to have some cutlery and plates. I may have missed information that said we could request these. The breakfast provided was fine although very busy and difficult to get a table some mornings so after a couple of days we didn't go back. The omelet station is a great idea but the lengthy queues were discouraging. The drinks and music at night were enjoyable the night we went and the band was great.

In the evening there are less kids, and you can enjoy the pool since it stays open pretty late.

For the first time of my many stays at this ES I found the room assigned to us upon check in was sub par in terms of the air conditioning problem (was88 degrees in the room) tv problem and location and size of the room. Called front desk and advised Garrick of air conditioning problem. He immediately sent mechanic to fix the problem. Told Garrick we would go to lunch to see if air conditioning improved. Lo and behold when we returned from lunch Garrick had already made arrangements to change us to a much more suitable room that reflected the quality I had been accustomed to at ES. This is the kind of personal service that sets this Waikiki hotel apart from its surrounding competitors when you include their breakfasts and happy hours. Thank you Garrick.

It was nice seeing everyone enjoying their time together at the Embassy Suites.The breakfast was so delicious every morning. Plenty of choices! We always enjoyed our cooked to order omelette, miso soup, white rice and fresh fruits. We ate so much pineapple during our stay ( very sweet) and miss it so much already.When possible, we also returned for the evening Reception for drinks, snacks and nice entertainment ( 3-4 person ensemble). They played familiar songs and sometimes a few Hawaiian selections.We really felt comfortable doing our entire stay.It's true that the hotel is a little outdated but everything is clean and well maintained.

This hotel is located in a great spot, really close to the beach, trolley stop, and all major attractions. Also only a 3 minute walk to watch the Friday night fireworks. We had an ocean view room and the sunsets from our lanai were spectacular.The breakfast buffet is a bonus - it saves you from walking around trying to find somewhere to eat. The omelette stations were also a nice touch if you wanted something cooked fresh.The rooms itself are quite good - I wouldn't go so far as to say they are 'massive' but it's certainly handy to have the separation between the adults and the children. The cleaners did a great job of daily servicing. Afternoon drinks at the pool are also a good family bonus, particularly if you are on the way home from the beach. The pool does get very crowded, particularly with unsupervised kids - I'm surprised there are not more injuries! The 'all inclusive' price by the hotel is great, no extra costs for towels etc. if you want to go to the beach. I probably wouldn't bother with the tour desk, it's just an agency booking station (same as anywhere else in Waikiki). You will find better (and less expensive) tours with a 5 minute Google search from your hotel room. Same applies for car hire.All up, we really enjoyed this place as a family location, but if I was staying in Waikiki as a couple I'd probably look at other options.","Brisbane, Australia","Craig0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",83,4.0

Friendly staff and spacious suites, which is great when you have kids and appreciate the extra room a suite provides. Not so great is access to the balconies. I was a bit worried about the kids (4 and 6) opening the door and going out there, in my opinion, the child safety latches are good but not high enough, the kids could reach them, no problem. Also, we had a balcony, but you couldn’t really sit out there, they were so tiny you could not comfortably sit out there without contorting your body on a weird angle!The pool/pool area is nice but it gets full on crazy busy with the kids everywhere, especially in the afternoon. This is fine if you have kids (and even then it can be annoying having kids squirting you in the face with various pool toys), but some kid free adults might find this annoying, especially trying to relax in the spa, which is right next to the pool. Not sure if it’s possible for an adults only pool/spa area?Buffet breakfast was nice, although some variety would have been good. You can order eggs cooked to your liking (not just omelettes), which I didn’t realise until the second last day of our stay, much better than eating those disgusting scrambled, over cooked eggs provided.Managers special happy hour was great, they sure don’t scrimp on the alcohol! The queues can get quite long, although we didn’t seem to have a problem as we went to the other bar, in the corner, which not many people realised, was a lot quieter, with hardly anyone there. The band was just awesome and got the crowd fired up most nights.We stayed here during Hurricane Lane and were always kept informed of the situation by hotel management, which was reassuring.A couple of things to note, which did not impress me, overcharging on some basic services. I realise you are a business and need to make a profit but overcharging on international calls is just ridiculous and left me a bit annoyed. Over $30 US for an international call (which cost me less than $10 US in Maui the previous week) and $38 US for one night’s parking ($14 US in Maui) is just a little too steep and difficult to stomach. When questioning staff member upon checkout, shrugs her shoulders and replies “I don’t know” and in the same sentence proceeds to ask me “charge it to the credit card on file?”. Yeah, thanks, but no thanks.","Melbourne, Australia","bootiepie1</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

The beds were delightful, so comfortable.We were located on the 2nd floor just outside of the elevators (hey we didn't pay for a view so we didn't get one :) ) There was no noise issues whatsoever! I was surprised and pleased. Of course if you open the doors to the lanai you're going to get street noise.The hotel is located close to the beach with beautiful turtles off the breakwater. I would recommend the Hale Kona snack shack. For us it was great, we sat in a comfy chair having cocktails (both virgin and alcoholic) watching the kids in the beach. If you're a patron of the shack the chairs and shade are free! There was a hire place next door to the snack shack that you could rent floating islands (like a big thick yoga mat that floats) for $10 an hour or water bikes $25 for 1/2 an our (trust me after peddling one of these things 1/2 an hour is enough!). If you don't want to rent, go to the ABC store and buy a floating ring for $2.50 they have just as much fun with that too!When travelling around the island I would recommend taking the bus, we've been there heaps of times and have never hired a car. Our only luxury for this trip was to get a limo from the airport to the hotel. We went to Top Limousine Services, the price for a limo was comparable to a shuttle and or taxi for the 5 of us. We figured it was a nice touch, our kids were impressed as it was a surprise for them! There are plenty of restaurants nearby and you don't have to walk far to get good food or to access Ross Dress for Less (a must for families on a budget with teenagers that like name brands like Nike, Adidas and Under Armour). I would recommend that when you arrive, go to Longs Drugs and the other end of the block and get your snacks and drinks for the kids. It's cheaper there and you have more variety. The ABC store is fine too, I just preferred Longs.We didn't interact with the staff very much but ensured that we did tip, especially in the free events like breakfast and the evening reception, always take a few dollars down with you - it doesn't hurt. We never had any issues with housekeeping either. We ensured we tipped $5 every day. That ensured we had LOTS of shampoo, towels and coffee. We even got a lovely note from the housekeeper thanking us which was a nice touch.If you are considering staying at this hotel do it! We found it exception value for money with our family of 5, good rooms, good service and great location.","Bendigo, Australia","933jackiep</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bendigo, Australia</strong>",4,5.0

We love that the all rooms have a sleeping area and living area which give us space to stretch out. We loved that the kitchen had a microwave enabling us to heat up left over food from the previous nights dining for the kids when they were ‘starving’. Clean and comfortable, the room service is top notch and the amenities are of a good quality. Staff are friendly and eager to please across the board.The complimentary breakfast was a bonus. Buffet food, is buffet food and you can choose to eat the whole mass cooked variety or eat toast/bagel and fruit. I never complain about buffet breakfasts as no one ever said you had to load your plate with bacon, hash browns, scrambled ‘eggs’ and little sausages. They do have an omelette station which is a good option for fresh cooked.The evening managers reception was also a bonus. It lacks the atmosphere of a beach front bar but you’re not paying $15 a cocktail....it’s on the house. Snacks are provided. Again, nothing hugely special but you’re not paying for it. You have choices. It’s a bonus, you don’t have to partake.We ordered room service and ate in one night (pizza) which was really nice and the price was on par with going down the road to get a take away pizza.I would recommend this place to families. I don’t think it would be a place that a couple wanting romance would go. It’s a family place.We would certainly return to Embassy Waikiki.

Most of the staff are lovely (with the exception of the guy looking for wrist bands at the reception). The rooms are spacious and our view from the Hula Tower was fantastic. Comfortable beds. The rooms are getting a little tired though. This is our second stay at this hotel and it is showing its age.The breakfast was good. It got a bit repetitive though as there was not a huge variety. Omelettes were great. Just get there early to avoid the big crowds.The pool is way too small for a resort this big. It was full of kids and not what I would call super relaxing. There were kids all over the place (and I have no issue with kids... I was travelling with my kids... it was just super crowded). It is a very family oriented hotel so if you are looking for a quiet romantic adult type place to stay this is not it. Great for families though. But it’s busy. Housekeeping was ok. Not stellar. I paid extra for a “premium suite” (don’t bother, it is not worth it). I was constantly having to call to get things like our coffee refreshed because it was not done. So this was an irritant. One day our room did not get serviced at all. So we had to call and have I done while we were out for dinner. Again, not the end of the world but when you are staying somewhere this expensive you do not want to have to ask for things you paid for multiple times.Check out and check in was great. Fast and no issues.I don’t know that I will be rushing back though (unless I got a crazy good deal).

The rooms are quiet, the beds are soft, and bathroom is spacious. I would recommend a room on a higher level. We stayed on the 19th floor. If you can get an ocean view, this would also be good.

This is Waikiki so primarily a tourist hotel but had no problems with business needs. They welcomed me with a small glass of ice cold pineapple/fruit juice. A nice local touch. Loved the Grand Lanai with live music and appetizers and drinks in the evening on the 4th floor. Free breakfast was also at the Grand Lanai each morning (make sure you get there between 6:30 and 7:15 to beat the masses). It's Hawaii so taking advantage of relaxing outside in the beautiful weather was perfect, even taking my laptop to do some work on the Grand Lanai. This is a very solid, nice hotel but not necessarily luxurious if that's your thing. I personally have no desire to pay a few couple extra hundred $$ for luxury. It is clean and has everything you would need. Rate was pretty good compared to other hotels - a little less than $300 per night before tax. Typical Embassy Suite setup with living area and separate bedroom. If you've never stayed at an Embassy Suites, this is a great hotel for families since alll rooms are set up this way where kids and parents have their own space however small. Staff was all friendly and helpful. I used the workout room once and it was above average size (not a ""closet"" workout room like some smaller hotels) and had most equipment including several treadmills, elliptical, basic weights, etc.Tip: Ask for a room on 4th floor. This is same floor as Grand Lanai so only took me about 60 seconds from my room to breakfast or evening reception plus it was easy to take the stairs down to the street as there can be longer waits for the elevators at peak times. Location was good with easy walk to all the main shopping and restaurants in Waikiki Beach. I never had to leave in the evening to eat a nice dinner or check out the activity in Waikiki. If you do need to go some where, Uber cars are plentiful and you'll have no trouble getting one here.","Springfield, Missouri","whydidwegohere</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Springfield, Missouri</strong>",85,5.0

We loved each of our stays and love to call this hotel our second home. Breakfast: From families to couples to solo travel, this hotel is for everyone. It's especially great for families looking for a more budget-friendly option in Waikiki Beach in the way that the hotel provides a complimentary breakfast buffet where you can order eggs in any style you'd prefer. This occurs daily and it's the best amenity the hotel provides. For families, Hawaii can be an expensive destination if one eats out every single day, but due to the free breakfast included in your room rate, you do not have to worry about spending $100 USD on breakfast, which can easily be spent in the tourist hub of Waikiki. The breakfast is fantastic, and is the best breakfast we have had in all of the Embassy Suites hotels we have been to (we have visited many). The breakfast staff is also very friendly, and I would like to say a big thank you to Rose, who is so friendly and made both of our stays extra special. There are so many choices of breakfast foods that will leave you full for the majority of the day until dinnertime.The hotel also has a nightly Manager's Reception, which is basically a happy hour with free drinks and snacks by the pool on the fourth floor (the pool area is also gorgeous with many lounge chairs to relax on). Make use of this and try a Mai Tai.Check-In: The check-in process at this hotel has always been so fast and friendly. The hotel's lobby is located right beside where you can park your vehicle via valet (costs $36 nightly but is so worth it; the staff is so friendly and brings out your car so quickly). When you check-in, you and your family receive a nice glass of guava juice which shows that you're starting your stay right.Rooms: The rooms at the Embassy Suites are lovely, and perfect for a longer stay on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. The rooms are decorated Hawaiian style, and the two-room one bedroom suite with two queen beds is where we have stayed in our last two visits. The best part of the room are the two lanais (balconies), which allow you to relax after a nice day at the beach or out exploring. City views are the best as you're able to see what is going on below you on Waikiki's Beachwalk, the nicest area of Waikiki Beach. Each room provides you with bath towels, of course, in addition to beach towels which you can use throughout your stay (new ones are added daily). The rooms are large and perfect for a Hawaiian stay.The cleaning services are amazing at this hotel; our room was always perfectly clean. I would like to mention Nu Yang, who cleaned our room for the duration of our stay. She was awesome and went above and beyond to make our stay more enjoyable.Location: This hotel is located in THE BEST PART OF OAHU: Waikiki Beach. It is less than a five-minute walk to bustling Kalakaua Ave, which is a street full of shops, restaurants and entertainment such as the Royal Hawaiian Center's frequent concerts. My family always enjoyed strolling along the street in the evening and nighttime after a lovely day at the beach or hiking. Waikiki Beach is about a ten-minute walk from the hotel, and it is such a gorgeous beach. However, I do not recommend spending your entire trip in Waikiki Beach or else you cannot say you experienced Hawaii or even the island of Oahu. The hotel's prime location, being only 20 minutes from Honolulu's International Airport and less than an hour's drive to anywhere on the island allows you to explore all that the island has to offer. Eat a hearty breakfast in the morning and head off and see the entire island. It's paradise.Without a doubt, you must visit this hotel if you are planning a trip to Oahu and the Waikiki Beach area. After an excellent two stays in the past, we know we will be back to this amazing hotel in the near future. It is one of the best hotels we've stayed at.",,TravellerWanderlust,12,5.0

Kalakaua to me IS Waikiki Beach. The shops, restaurants and beach on that stretch is what I know and love. But then I discovered that I was just a short 10 min walk to the center of Kalakaua ave where the Market is (more on the market later, so much has changed) and was relieved. BUT THEN (yes, again) I discovered the beach access point directly across the street from this hotel and was VERY happy with the view of MY Diamond Head from the beach! You can see more of it than you can from the other part of the beach which is accessed via Kalakaua! AND it felt private!! The hotel is GREAT. Rooms are cozy (if you care for views, I'd spring for a room with a nice view). We had a 1 bedroom king suite and it was very nice! The showers are gooood. Daily breakfast buffet was delish, some of the options changed daily and was a nice surprise! And who doesn't love an omelette station? 2 stations and the lines moved fast (I would go between 8 and 9 am). Also the FREE happy hour nightly reception with the live band is a very nice touch. This hotel definitely makes you feel like you are appreciated, welcome and provides that vacation feel. Here, you'll be close to everything and the grounds are beautiful! They did take a while one day to get to our room to clean it. But we didn't care about that. We ran into one of the housekeepers in the hall, she was super apologetic about not getting to our room yet, but we just grabbed some fresh towels and toiletries and told her not to worry! The rest of our days, they were on point and we had a clean room every time we came back to it.","Bronx, New York","Nicole J</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bronx, New York</strong>",17,5.0

You’ll usually get that kind of service in hotels if you are a high roller our platinum club member. Not at Embassy Suites Beachwalk in Waikiki; everyone is greeted that way. After a few days there they remember you by name and it’s like passing by friends on your way out. Our maid Nena was awesome! Anything we requested on our notepad she fulfilled; extra towels, shampoos, lotions. Even the cooks and busboys at our free full breakfast and waitresses are pleasantly friendly and hospitable. The bell and especially the valet guys and gals were all awesome! I cannot find any flaws at this hotel other than our stay was too short. And my family all know me to be very picky! Because of this we are planning on coming back again and again! Maybe even holding our family reunion there. Thank You Embassy Suites for a wonderful Hawaiian experience for me and my family! Keep up that great work! And just a side note: please people, tip your waiters, waitresses, valets, etc. Hawaii is expensive to live in, These wonderful people don’t get paid enough for their hard work to make you happy.

We had been traveling around Canada and looking forward to the last leg of the trip, that changed on arrival. I had requested a floor higher up well they directed us to a room on the bottom floor that looked out to the back lane with all the food trucks on top of that the room smelt mouldy had a small window I couldn't even believe it was a guest room and we where staying nine nights. Within minutes I contacted reception asking to be changed which they did to another room that was on the other side looking out to the abc store. This was a huge improvement although not great. The catch was we could stay in here for a night then they would change us to a better room again on the third night. Apparently this room the abc room was booked out the next night. So we moved twice in two nights couldn't unpack moved our own suit cases it could only get better and thank god the third room was what we wanted. The rooms are now dated and need an upgrade they haven't really changed in years. The breakfast was so so the chef is the only thing that saves it. The place was packed I am sure people come in that are not guests, eg guests friends nobody checks this at breakfast and free cocktail time at night. They always used to check guests passes on previous stays. The cleaning staff are great as are the wait staff at breakfast. Reception staff are average at best.

There were snacks (so-so) but also fancy fruity cocktails included at no extra charge.

I did not get a warm, island-welcome feeling that you expect from a trip to Hawaii, but rather felt more like I was staying in downtown Manhattan. It felt more like we entered a big assembly line. On checkout day, we truly needed a late checkout time due to our flight schedule, but after repeated requests - and even as a Hilton Honors member - they repeatedly said no and made no effort to accommodate the requests. I recommend that they increase their staff and show a bit more flexibility. One exception is with the housekeeping and breakfast-buffet staff, who were extremely friendly and accommodating.

Our booking included four buffet breakfast and four evening reception. First of all I must interpolate here to say that the receptionist was really friendly and helpful. She was Lorena. We went very early in order to leave our luggage with the bell boy before we could check in at 3 pm. It was then just at about 8 am. Lorena checked us in and informed me she would try to give us the rooms as soon as possible. She also allowed us to have free buffet breakfast. At about 11.12 am,Oren’s texted to inform me our suite was ready for us. The suite consisted of one two queen sized beds bedroom, one super king size bed bedroom, one lounge, one kitchenette and two toilets and two entrance doors. The rooms were spacious, clean and cosy. There were three balconies with ocean view. The house keepers were very good. We never ran short of amenities like toilets paper hand tissues and tooth paste as there was abundant reserve. Honestly I never experienced this albeit I’m a frequent picky traveler. The location of the hotel was very good. It is almost in the central Waikiki. However the quality and variety of food for breakfast were not acceptable to me. It was very basic consisting of steamed rice, bacons, sausages, chips, salads, two egg stations for omelettes and fried eggs, basic cereals, basic local fruits and basic toast and muffins. There was no cappuccino or flat white but just normal coffee and tea. The food for breakfast were exactly same during our four nights’ stay. The plates were not dry with water still in them. We had to wipe them on dry tissues. The two egg stations were too busy all the time. The wait was at least 15 minutes. The eating area was fairly big but very congested as there were too many people. There were lots of birds there. They would eat your breakfast before you if you left it unattended on the table. You should fully cover it up with a piece of tissue paper. I personally was very disgusted by the birds as they might spread disease if we ate the food contaminated by them. The evening complimentary reception was crap, just chips, raw red carrots and cauliflowers and cheap drink. They served alcoholic drink on plastic cups. I would prefer not to have a glass of complimentary beer or wine than to give a dollar tip! The swimming pool was small, only good for children.

What is wrong with me?There are several people at the pool who are extremely friendly. They appreciate and recognize customers who frequent the hotel. Dennis, Keolu, Shane, Daniel, and PeLani (I’m sorry- I know I spelled some names wrong) and a couple others that I don’t know their names, are amazing and great examples of customer service. The hotel management needs to focus on hiring more employees like them. Now they have arm bands they make you wear to happy hour and breakfast. I have two issues with this. 1) they advertise where you are staying - I’m not interested in giving free advertising to them - but really it is a safety issue. I’m female. Anyone sees it on my arm outside the hotel and they know where I am staying. Yes I know I can take it off. But that leads to issue two. 2). They do not have multiple sizes and it was tight on my husbands arm. He took it off and forgot it in the car. The front desk wouldn’t give him another one and made him get it out of the car which was valet parked! This was hugely inconvenient. There is a woman who stands at the pool and she questions everyone. She is super rude about it and acts like everyone is trying to sneak in to the pool. The first night I was already at the pool with my arm band and I had my husbands in my purse waiting for him. She escorted him over to me to make sure he had an armband. She makes me uncomfortable and she is the main reason I probably won’t stay there again. I appreciate not allowing non guests to use the facility but it is a problem when the person doing that makes guests feel unwelcome. ",,keyw808,18,1.0

The hotel is very close to everything, walking distance to beach, shops, dining and also to access the little buses that take you everywhere. As breakfast is included it really makes for a great way to save money. On a couple of mornings we decided to eat out and the minimum cost for a sit down, cooked breakfast for two at venues nearby was around $100 - so it really pays to eat your breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast if buffet style with plenty of options to choose from. The Happy Hour (which is actually 2 hours) is very generous. And when they say happy hour, they mean you don't pay anything. Having said that, I felt it was only right to tip the bartender. They also mix the drinks pretty strong!

We come from Melbourne, where there is an abundance of really fresh, healthy foods, and this was not that. Soy or almond milk was a non starter.3. Very noisy- the band play a few times a week and if you want to put little ones down and have a pool facing room it's just not possible. Granted they were done by 8pm the couple of nights they played when we were there, but speaking to other guests it didnt stop until 10pm the night before we arrived (perhaps ask for a room facing away from the pool to avoid this, but then you'll miss the view and seeing the Friday night fireworks).4. The lack of kitchen facilities- there is a microwave, bar fridge and kettle. No way to cook your own meals, which is hard when you're struggling to find fresh healthy food in the area.5. The sofa bed, which my partner and I slept on was horribly hard and squeaked every time we moved, waking us). So a one bedder does sleep 4 as advertised but only 2 comfortably.We'll be back to the area but looking at alternative accommodation.",,Leeeleee3,6,3.0

Nice all suite hotel but does has have some down points. Upon arrival, the check-in staff member that helped us could have been more welcoming, maybe he was having a bad day. Our room wasn't ready yet but the couple that we were travelling with who was attended by another staff member was allocated their suite so we left our luggage in their room until ours was ready, a few hours later. Suite was nice, fairly spacious. Beds were comfortable, shower lacked water pressure but adequate. We had a 1 bedroom suite with 2 double beds. Balcony was small but ok. It's not on the beach but it's only a 5 minute walk and Starbucks is on the way which is great. Pool is quite small and not very deep, more suited to children. It can get very busy in the afternoons so we didn't use very much, maybe a couple of times. Afternoon cocktails were a nice bonus and there is even entertainment. Breakfast for my liking was average and need to get there before 9:30 as they start to clear everything by about 9:45 or so as they close at 10:00. It is very close to all the shopping and some great restaurants. Lifts can be slow.

We made use of the gym and the pool area daily and all services are well serviced and provided.The only feedback I could provide would be an earlier check in than 3pm, our flight arrived at 6am and although the hotel offered us breakfast and use of the sevices, by 11am we were all out on the pool deck chairs asleep waiting for our room, even if the check in was at 1pm it would save bleary eyed travellers hanging in the lobby and the pool, of which we saw daily - to be honest there is not a hotel in Hawaii that would not experience this and we were greateful at least to be able to use the hotel pool and restrooms while we waited- I have had friends fall asleep on Waikiki waiting to get into there room! We did run into a family who the day before had been offered a room on arrival early - so I guess it’s a luck of the drawer and how fulll the hotel is.This hotel is fantastic and we will be back !

The next day I received a call saying they found my ring in the safe & mailed it back to me. Who would do this? Thankfully there are still honest people around. I thought I would never see my ring again. This made me a fan for life until recently. I had issues with my booking for our 10 yr anniversary trip in September.

I was expecting a more tropical vibe with beautiful flowers and brightly colored homes I guess Maui would have been a better choice for that. As for our hotel choice Embassy Suites rocks. We arrived around 1pm and checked in with Cindy who was very friendly and helpful, she gave my daughter who was celebrating her bday the following day a box of chocolates and cookies and upgraded our room (thank you again). The first room we had (prior to the upgrade) was in the aloha tower on the 18th floor, the suite was comfortable but a little small. The upgraded room was a nice large suite in the hula tower with an ocean view from the Living area and a street view from the bedroom. I didn't notice much of a difference between the two towers just different views depending on the suite you get. The only negative was the bed pillows they were too soft for my taste, a pillow menu would have been nice or at least have firmer pillows available. The fact that there are no resort fees, free daily breakfast buffet and nightly managers reception with free drinks(awesome) this in my opinion gives you the best bang for the buck of the other hotels I considered. Even though I will probably not be returning to Hawaii I would definitely recommend this property to anyone who is planning a visit.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","ladyj17</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</strong>",19,5.0

It is tastefully decorated, clean has 2 balconies to relax on.In the room it has a small kitchen with a coffee machine, kettle, sink and a microwave- no utensils or cups. The small fridge lacks a freezer compartment, so we had to eat a whole tub of ice cream in one fell swoop!There are not many hotels in Hawaii that offer free breakfast, so this was a bonus. The breakfast lasts for about 3 hours and caters for most tastes- Asian, western, yoghurt, fruit, eggs, pancakes, donuts, pastries cereals and you can have as much as you want.The pool - which includes a spa- is quite large which rarely gets crowded and is also the area where they have happy hour (5:30-7:30) where it gets very busy. Happy hour provides free drinks - beer, wine spirits , soft drinks and some snacks.Local buses are 100m away to take you to the ala Moana shopping centre or wiekele outlet stores - $5.50 for adults $2.50 children - all day or it’s a$10 Uber drive both ways.All in all great value for money - we paid $256usd per night and would highly recommend if you’re not looking for a self catering holiday in Waikiki.Off to Maui now!

Location is good, it’s a short 5min walk to the beach, DeRussy Park, Beachwalk is right in front with lots of shops, and dining options, Kalakaua Rd, International Market Place 10-15min walk. Roys and Denny’s is right downstairs. ABC Store across the road. It is however a very busy family hotel. At 6am, the excited kids are already up and screaming.The room options on the online check-in app was very average and all located at noisy busy areas, all by the elevator, by the ice and vending machines and on the corridor to the pool and breakfast area. Having no idea what our Lanai would be looking at, only choice was a room in the Hula tower (many reviewers recommended over the Aloha tower).The first room (4th floor) was dismal, view was to a neighboring hotel (their lanais looked into our lanais and room!), way too close to the street, no privacy. I took this up with the Registration desk (which is oddly located at the driveway of the hotel and did not feel welcoming), front desk staff were also not welcoming at all. Smiles were few and far between, nor was there any warmth nor friendliness. No acknowledgement of HH member. She did change the room for me to the 5th floor (this room did not come up as an option on the HH app). This room had a pool view but it also looked into the breakfast area, it was next to the elevator, vending and ice machine. I felt like we got given one of the worst rooms in the hotel. Pool being on the 4th floor, the 5th floor room was not much better. I just gave up. There was no offer for an upgrade (as HH Gold member) or even option to pay extra for a better room. She gave us our free bottles of water. Note: 2 x bottled water once only at check-in at this hotel. Many others like Hampton and Hilton we have stayed at give you free water every day.The first room on the 4th floor felt cramped and dark. The 5th floor room itself was clean but it is very dated and noisy but comfortable. Good size for 3 of us. Sofa bed was already made up with sheets, blankets and extra pillows in the cupboard. Beach towels and beach bag provided in the room. Neutrogena toiletries. Room was noisy next to the ice machine whirring and rumbling away, or maybe it was the AC or perhaps the elevator??. For a hotel where beach and pool are the main activities, puzzles me why these hotels do not provide drying racks to dry your swim gear, more so, when this hotel has lanais. I pre-requested extra towels and bathmat but none were provided. Only Valet parking available. I must say they were quick in getting your vehicle. Valet, Bell and breakfast staff were nice and friendly, not so much Front Desk. Disappointing as it is one of the first things a guest has to experience when checking in to a hotel, puzzling why hotels do not make the effort to make it a good experience for the guest.Buffet breakfast was included in the room rate. Selections were the usual fare, omelet station, bacon, sausages, etc. cereals (+gluten free), pancakes, toast, juices, coffee, no waffles. Busy hotel, breakfast is very busy, even at 7am! Breakfast staff were friendly and very helpful. One morning I was by myself, and it was busy, they helped reserve me a table.Pool is quite small, mainly for the kids. There is a spa also. There were some quieter lounge chairs. There is a bar by the pool. There is also happy hour with band music.  Having read so many good reviews about this hotel, I’m disappointed and unlikely to stay again. I’m also wondering if this rates highly, then are the other hotels in Waikiki worse??

Although it's not quite ""beachfront""--nor a ""resort""--we had a terrific partial ocean view from our very spacious King Suite in the Hula Tower, just minutes from the beach. I've always loved the room sizes and free breakfast at Embassy Suites, and would rate this hotel 4 stars. Here are my pros and cons:PROS:- BREAKFAST! The spread here is impressive indeed, with made-to-order omelettes, potatoes, tropical fruits, salad, miso soup, and a wide variety of beverages. There is something for everyone, and the lines were never too long.- Room size: Our King Suite was extremely spacious, with a large lanai (balcony) that went around the entire room.- Location: Although it's not technically ""beachfront"" property, it's about as close as one can get without abutting Waikiki. Great access to restaurants and other resorts, and a Roy's on site!CONS:- Parking is somewhat expensive and slow--and a bit of a hassle. We used the valet service, which cost almost $40/day. I'm not sure there were other options.- Housekeeping threw away a bag of groceries we had bought one night, which included some over-the-counter medicine. Although the front desk was apologetic, all they offered in return was one day's worth of parking fees. This mishap is what's stopping me from giving the hotel 5 stars, as I didn't feel like the front desk agent was particularly sympathetic.- Afternoon pupus were disappointing: We were expecting real, home-cooked finger foods--perhaps even some local grinds--but to our chagrin were greeted with nacho chips and goldfish. That said, they did have a live band one night during the Happy Hour.Overall, I would definitely stay here again. It's a family friendly hotel that's a bit smaller than some of the larger resorts nearby (Outrigger, Hilton Hawaiian Village, etc.), but it's newer--and the rooms more spacious--as well. Five stars for the room and location; four for the service (which was friendly but slow).","San Francisco, California","j_b_l802304</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",17,4.0

Check-in was a breeze and the suite was immaculate. Generally, hotel rooms in Waikiki are small and that can take some adjustment for multi-generational families traveling together. Embassy Suites was a great solution that still fit the budget. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms, living room and a small double deck with partial beach views - pretty tough to complain about. The location on BeachWalk was absolutely ideal. Steps from the beach, great restaurants and shopping. The 4th floor pool and activities area pushed this hotel over the top. There is a daily breakfast buffet - fruit, cereal, omelettes, bacon etc. Start your day with this and you don’t feel hungry until 4. Every evening the manager’s reception takes place by the pool. Light snacks and complimentary drinks. Think about that. Free breakfast and free drinks - yep, that keeps a few dollars in your pocket for souvenirs. Like most trips, however, the stay is boom or bust as a result of the staff. Embassy Suites wins here. All of the staff are friendly and willing to help.

The morning breakfast is one of the best anywhere, standard omelette prep like all Embassy Suites but the fresh pineapple and the miso soup and taro english muffins made it better. The atmosphere doesn’t hurt sitting outside on the 4 th floor lanai. They have a two hour social every night with free well drinks and of course they make all the Hawaiian favorites. The snacks are ok with a mix of veggies and chips and chex mix. Some hot pupu’s would be nice. This place is a block off the beach but perfect for families who want a nice pool, good breakfast and a location near shopping in downtown Waikiki.

I re-booked at this property because it was so much better than the Hilton Hawaiian Village stay we had previously, and I was again not disappointed.We were arriving very early in the morning (8AM) and had emailed the hotel in advance to request early check in if available. Imagine my surprise to be granted an upgraded room (partial ocean larger than usual; am an Hhonors Gold) which was totally unexpected and really made this second stay even more remarkable than the first; the room was ready on arrival. We were greeted with some complimentary beverages and provided breakfast coupons for that day and the remainder of our stay. The breakfasts have everything you could ever want, and the managers reception at night offers complimentary beverages (both adult and regular) . Everything is in walking distance. We were going to call an uber but the hotel had a limo parked in the reception area which took us for the same price as a cab - such a great perk!The pool is an excellent size with a spa/hot tub area - it's kept at a good temperature in both cases. The kids really enjoyed themselves here.This property is one of the few that does not have a resort fee as well; I never mind paying for a good hotel and this one was a little more than most, but I hate resort fees. Ancillary fees are ridiculous money grabs.The maintenance and room cleaning staff were always courteous and said hello when passing in the hall. A nice service touch.I can not say enough good things about this property. It is without a doubt one of my top two or maybe three hotels and resorts I've ever stayed in.

The only room we could book (using points) was an accessible room. We were on the 4th floor at the end by the pool (room 420 I believe), which is the end facing the ocean/beach (not the other pool end).Check-in was excellent and quick, we received our free Hilton gift (2 bottles of water--LOL). Staff was very friendly and courteous and our room was ready. Nice and clean. The bed was good (not too soft, although everyone is different) and the AC unit kept things nice and cool. We originally thought we might be in for some noise with the patio doors being right on the 4th floor to the pool, but did not have any issues with noise from that area. (Between rooms was a different story but mostly due to yelling/screaming children late at night and in the morning). Oh well, we should be up by 8:00 a.m. anyway I guess. hahaThe free breakfast was very good, I thought. They posted a little sign in the room telling you when ""prime"" hours were, although we didn't seem to notice an issue regardless of when we went (sometimes as late as 9:30). There was always a place to sit at. The only crowd was around the omelette station, but only when you had one person getting like 4 omelletes, othewise the lime moved pretty quickly. No mimosas, unfortunately (haha). But you could get juice and take it back to your room and have some (not sure if you could bring your bottle to the table or not).The pool was warm and the chairs comfortable. Lots of kids though (when we were there--your mileage may vary) so it was a little busy.The evening reception had a nice variety of snacks, usually a vegetable of some sort (broccoli, carrots, sliced zuchinni and dip) and then chips and pretzels and things. The one bartender (sorry I don't recall his name) is excellent. Strong pours/drinks and he was so fast it was like watching the Matrix. The pupu's/appetizer menu was decently priced and pretty decent as well.The location is quite nice as Roy's is on the 1st floor (had dinner and lunch there, it was so good). And the beach walk is right there as well.Walk across the street, turn right and walk a block or so and turn left and there's the start/end of Waikiki beach.I would definitely stay here again if I'm ever in Honolulu again (even though I own at Hilton Grand Vacation's Club). The free breakfast and drinks help defray costs, and we did use the little fridge and microwave to reheat some leftovers for lunches.Wi-Fi was fast (and I used my Hilton Honors ""regular"" WiFi, not the premium). TV selection was excellent also.","Albany, New York","mjonis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Albany, New York</strong>",27,4.0

We had a good experience with initial check in / valet and the ocean view 1 bedroom suite was good as expected. The problem is the bedroom of the suite (1721) is directly behind or adjoining the 3 elevators and the noise and vibrations from them made it very difficult to sleep, they were in full swing by 6am and in use till late. Sort of like a subway noise. I assume this problem exists in the same room on every floor. I went down to reception the next morning to explain our problem and ask for a room change. I was asked no questions about the issue nor offered any apology, which makes me think it's a common complaint. I was told we couldn't be moved till the following day and then would have to pack up and store our luggage by 11am then come back at 3pm to check into our new room. No offer of an early check in on the new room which is disappointing that it couldn't be a priority clean for an existing guest. This is quite inconvenient given we have a 2 year old that usually has a sleep at 1pm.

I used to stay at this location when it used to be the Coral Seas (many, many years ago!) so location-wise it is perfect. It's right on Lewers Street so there are a lot of stores and restaurants right across the street and it's a half block walk to the beach. We were lucky and were on the 20th floor so we had a partial ocean view one way and a city view the other way. Awesome!We chose this hotel primarily for it's free breakfast as we have 2 very hungry boys and it did not disappoint. No, it wasn't a spectacular selection but there was good food and they switched it up every day and really, the convenience of it was worth every penny. It was so nice not to have to gather everyone up and head out to a restaurant every morning. The free manager's reception every night was just mind-boggling. All that free alcohol and snacks every night!! How can you beat that?!The room itself was amazing! So clean and had all the amenities you could ask for. It even comes with beach towels that were replaced every day! We had the 2-bedroom suite as my parents joined us and there was plenty of room for all 6 of us.We would stay here again, if for no other reason, than the service. Everyone working at the Embassy Suites was friendly, helpful and willing to bend over backwards to make our stay a good one (which they succeeded in doing). A big shout out to the bartenders, Keola, Dennis and Lewis who always made our boys laugh and to Pi'ilani who was just the nicest person I've ever met. To stay that happy and friendly while taking all the tourists' orders every night takes a very special person. The pool was rather large for a pool in Waikiki and we made good use of its hot tub. There was even poolside service if you wanted to eat or drink which was an added bonus. The food was a few dollars more than at a restaurant but the portions were huge and it was VERY good.The only two minor cons that we have was that we found the live music to be a bit too loud (only 3 nights a week though) and the wifi really is awful.

Surrounded by plenty of other hotels and an almost infinite number of shops and restaurants. There is a lot to like about the embassy suites and the near by area. I can’t recall the offical check in time but our room was available when we check ed in at around 13:00. The check in process was efficient and welcome drinks were provided which was very refreshing. In just a few minutes we were issued identification slips for every guest as well as a room key which is required for the elevator. This I’m afraid was probably the biggest problem of the entire hotel. Two elevators for 20+ floors is simply not enough and the wait times were a bit of a nuisance. While the speed of the elevator ride wasn’t slow it was the waiting time that frustrated myself and other guests I interacted with when waiting for an elevator. There was a positive side to the elevator however.I always like the idea of needing your room card for the elevator as it gives you an extra sense of security and I wish more places would implement this system.For people like me who like to walk the emergency exit stairs was definitely a better option but we were on the eighth floor so I’m not sure I’d say the same thing if we were on the twentieth floor. Once we got out of the lift I noticed an ice dispenser. Ice dispensers can be found on every floor with soda machines on alternate floors. This is useful as the tap water in the room wasn’t that cold. Once we got in the room my initial impression was that it’s quite small. This impression never changed which is strange as the name of the hotel suggested the rooms were all supposedly suites. Travelling all over the world I know what to expect from a standard room and a suite and this was barely the size of a standard room in a city hotel. I must say we were unfortunate to be at the end of the hallway by the emergency stairs which cut off some of the size of the room. Immediately on the right was your usual tea and coffee making facilities with a fridge underneath the bench.The room consisted of a lounge with a separate bedroom and bathroom. The lounge had a sofa bed which a five footer would have hardly fit into so being a six footer I slept diagonally across the bed and just managed to fit. There was a television that appeared to be about 30 inches which was identical to the television in the bedroom. There was plenty of seating in the lounge area but there was almost no room once the sofa bed is folded down. There was an air conditioning unit in both the lounge and bedroom which was convenient. Our room had a balcony that was of reasonable size but the view was nothing notable. In the bedroom there were two queen beds with plenty of pillows and a wardrobe. The bathroom consisted of a shower over the bath which was surprisingly small and appeared only to be about a foot high. I didn’t use it but could see that it probably wouldn’t be great due to its size. There were adequate amenities, shower and beach towels for each guest and a standard toilet of course. There was only one sink and plenty of hand soap and flannels provided.There was a desk which would be useful if you need to work along with complimentary unlimited Wi-Fi which is almost becoming standard worldwide but I’m still grateful for it. Small features such as a safe and luggage rack could also be found.While the room had everything you’d want it was quite small so we preferred to spend more time out of it and luckily embassy suites has the facilities to cater for this. On the fourth floor there is a dining area beside the pool and the bar. This of course was a very desirable place to spend time. The buffet breakfast is served here every morning and a decent spread but definitely fell short of European and Asian buffet breakfasts in my opinion. While it had your usual pastries, cooked food and cereal. The variety wasn’t great and the quality wasn’t that satisfying either. However there was still enough to choose from and the highlight was probably the made to order eggs which were of high quality. The breakfast was included in the room rate so I’d say it’s still worth it but I most certainly have had better buffet breakfast many times. The pool wasn’t that big and we didn’t use it due to the fact the beach is nearby. The pool was often over crowded and the deck chairs were often fully occupied especially around complimentary food and drink time. This occurred on a daily basis between 1730 and 1930 and included a whole range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Alcoholic drinks were available at the bar but there was usually a long queue while there were self serve soft drinks.The food included snacks such as pretzels and nachos so perfectly adequate for a pre-dinner snack.Obviously this is an opportunity not to be missed as could be seen by the crowd in the dining area at this time. Every alternate night there was also live music at this time. Other features of the embassy suites worth noting is the facilities on the third floor. This included a laundry room and a gym. The gym had a decent amount of equipment in a small area. This along with low ceilings made it the most claustrophobic gym I’ve ever been in. Once on the treadmill a six footer like me is barely a foot from the ceiling. The flow of air wasn’t that great either making it the hardest experience I’ve ever had in a gym. So definitely not the normal gym environment. Luckily the gym was never that busy when I used it otherwise it would have felt very squished . The equipment was all good quality and none of if it looked very old. There was no major gym equipment missing so most people would be satisfied with what’s on offer. The laundry was next to the gym and had several washing machines and dryers and only cost a few dollars to complete your laundry. On the ground floor there was a concierge which was very useful for booking tours all over the island. From pearl harbour to boat trips there was plenty of choice. Overall this was a very cool place to stay for a weeks vacation. The surrounding area and all the facilities at the embassy suites meant you could always be easily occupied. Even though the rooms were small it didn’t really matter as we didn’t come on vacation to stay in our hotel room. I would recommend to all those on vacation in this area as it has an excellent location. I will definitely consider embassy suites next time I’m in Waikiki but would opt for a larger room.","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Edwin V</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",25,4.0

We arrived in Honolulu on an early morning flight & got to the hotel around 7:30 am. The hotel check-in is not until 3:00 pm & the hotel was happy to securely store our luggage until our room was ready. Although the hotel rates include complimentary buffet breakfast, our free breakfast does not really commence until the next morning but they gave us extra breakfast that morning. After breakfast, we strolled down Fort DeRussy beach & park which is across the road. A beautiful beach & park! We also walked around Kalakaua Road & downtown Waikiki while waiting for our room to be ready. Kalakaua Road is the main shopping road in the heart of waikiki is around the corner from the hotel, around 3-5 minutes walk from Waikiki Beach Walk which is where the hotel is. We stayed at the Aloha tower so our hotel room view was the Waikiki Beach Walk side and our balconies are directly over the Beach walk shows & performance area.They called me on my mobile phone & had our room ready at 2 pm. I requested the hotel to provide us with two queen beds after I booked a room with a king bed. They didn’t disappoint & gave us what we requested.The complimentary buffet breakfast is a great plus with the hotel. There is an omelette station where the chef will cook it on the spot. There’s a good assortment of bread, streaky bacon & alternates of french toast, pancakes, sausages & chorizo patties. For a family with two grown big boys, the buffet breakfast most definitely saved us money & the boys had satisfied full tummy before we go on our daily hawaiian adventures. The daily managers reception happy hour is a wonderful touch, with good complimentary cocktails & snacks. There is a band performing at happy hour monday, wednesday & friday. The complimentary Wi-fi is fantastic & there is no resort fees.There are a lot of restaurants to choose within a minute going downstairs or a few more minutes walking downtown. There were some nights we stayed in after a full tiring day so we bought poke’ bowls, chicken soup & hotdogs from the big ABC store across the road at Waikiki beachwalk. This ABC store actually have a good range of food/dishes they cook on site.Our room/suite was spacious, the beds are comfortable. Bathroom is clean & housekeeping are done daily & well. Housekeeping provided us with generous toiletries. Any requests were done immediately. I could not really fault this hotel at all and is very satisfied & happy with both the location & services! The hotel staff are always happy to help. Even the tours I booked separately have their pick up location at the Outrigger Hotel across the road which was really convenient! Oh, the guava juice they serve at check in to welcome us was a nice touch!There is a trolley stop we go to to get to Ala Moana Centre at Trump hotel & the Post Office at Saratoga road which is a street away from the Reception side street of the Embassy Suites. I’m happy to recommend this hotel to anyone who wants be in the heart of downtown Waikiki where the beach, shopping & restaurants are conveniently handy within minutes!

Overall, we would rate it as excellent. We booked a 1 bedroom suite and upon check-in they ""upgraded"" us to a corner suite on a high floor which was great. The room had really good views of the city and also looked out towards the ocean from some windows. The room was well equipped with a mini fridge, living room area, multiple TVs and a dining table. We especially liked that it had 2 full bathrooms. As well, it was quite spacious compared to other placed we've stayed at in Waikiki. We thought the included daily breakfast was quite good, with a decent assortment of choices as well as the made-to-order omelette stations. The location of the hotel is also very good as it is close to basically everything in Waikiki and located on a nice and safe street (Beachwalk).What really stood out at this hotel was the quality of the staff. Everyone from the valet parking staff, to the front desk, breakfast staff and housekeeping were excellent and friendly. In just over a week at the hotel, we literally did not come across a single employee who was not friendly and wanting to help.The only suggestion we have for improvement would be the cleanliness of the outside of the windows in the hotel room. As noted, we had an excellent view but the outside of the windows were really in need of cleaning which distracted from the view somewhat (mainly during the day). To be clear, the cleanliness of our room itself was great and there was no issue whatsoever with even the inside of the windows - it was purely the sides of the windows which face outside.We would 100% stay here again on future visits to Hawaii.","Calgary, Canada","jdalbert</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",42,5.0

Upon arrival we were given an upgade from a single room to a two room suite, we were a family of four. Although perhaps a little dated, the suite was perfect and a good size.We were offered a room in the tower closest to the beach too but opted instead for the Aloha tower as it was ready immediately..The hotel facitlites were of a high standard and the loacation is probably one of the best in Waikiki IMO. The only let down was the relatively slow lifts , there never seems to be enough..The breakfast was extravagant and the free manager's reception was pretty good too... We had to wait for a late night flight but couldn't get a late check out. The place was busy so totally understand, they did offer us a complimentary room for half an hour or so before our transfer arrived...It was great to freshen up and everybody seemed to go out of their way to make our stay comofrtable and fun.

As we were going to be doing a lot of errands we did rent a car, and finding the property the first time was an experience. There are a lot of one-way roads around the hotel, and the entrance isn't that well marked off the street. Parking was valet-only and $38 a night, which seemed a little steep. However, the valet staff was wonderful and we never spent more than a couple minutes waiting for the car.Our room was on the 10th floor of the Hula wing, and offered a partial ocean view from both lanais. The location was a little noisy in the mornings with garbage trucks and other industrial vehicles down on the road, but we had no issue with evening noise and never heard our neighbors. Could hear kids down at the pool during the day, but usually quieted down by 8pm. Everything in the room worked well, and enjoyed having the refrigerator in the room to provide cold beverages after long days out of the room. The bathroom felt a little dated, but no issues with cleanliness or mold. Plenty of towels provided for both the shower and the pool / beach.Breakfast offered a good selection of hot and cold offerings, including cooked to order eggs and omelettes. There were also a few Asian offerings to cater to different tastes, including rice and miso soup. The only thing we found disappointing was the fresh fruit offerings - other than pineapple there were no local products, and much of it looked like it had been out for several hours. Drinks and snacks at the managers evening reception were pretty tasty, and a much better selection than I have seen at other Embassy Suites. Both breakfast and the reception were well attended, but seating was never a problem.As this was a working trip we did not get any use of the pool, but it looked pretty nice and well maintained. There were not a lot of seats around the pool, and they were all taken whenever we would look down from our room. Guessing the area is relatively small as Waikiki is just a 5-minute walk away, but given the size of the hotel a little bit more pool seating might be called for.Overall our stay was fine, and we will consider the hotel again if we return to Oahu.","Kalaheo, Hawaii","Jenz99</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kalaheo, Hawaii</strong>",89,4.0

The two bedroom suites are expensive but very spacious, we selected a King bed in one room and two Queen beds in the other. The suite had 2 bathrooms, a kitchenette, a living room and 2 lanai with ocean views. We were in a high floor, the glazing cuts out all street noise.The complimentary breakfasts are excellent with something to suit everyone. Take note of the recommended less busy times if you are in a hurry.The complimentary evening reception is also good with a wide range of free beverages and some snacks. The first night we had a great Hawaiian band (father and 3 sons) who had many people singing along to well known songs and later up and dancing. Great fun.The hotel has an excellent pool and large sun deck but it is only minutes to the beach. Turn right to DeRussy Beach for less crowds. There is a huge range of shops and restaurants within a 1-10 minute walk.One Small complaint - the WiFi was slow and you had to log back on frequently. The daily room rate is high but there are no resort fees like many other hotels and you get all the benefits of an apartment with daily room service and the breakfast and reception. Cheaper advance purchase non refundable rates are available.","Melbourne, Australia","Virginiaatf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",68,5.0

We are glad we went back. With an older family, we took a two bedroom suite, which is two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living area and kitchenette and balconies off each room. We did not pay for a view but had a pretty good one, being able to see the ocean from the balconies. Evidently the rooms have been refreshed/renewed fairly recently as everything was in very good condition, with an absence of the scrapes, scratches and marks common in family oriented hotels. The rooms are very good sizes and we never felt cramped for space.Our flight from Australia meant we arrived over three hours before checkin was due but we were still immediately given our room. The checkin process was friendly and efficient.Location wise, the Embassy is conveniently located. The Derussy Park beach is a couple of minutes away, Kalakaua Avenue at the end of the street and an enormous number of shops, restaurants and bars in the surrounding areas. Its about 10 minutes by Uber from Ala Moana and 35 minutes from the airport, subject to traffic.The Embassy has a Grand Lanai on the 4th level which is a large pool, bar and eating area. The included buffet breakfast is served here each morning. It is justly popular and it is wise to avoid the peak times if you're inclined to get up a little earlier. Made to order omelets are popular but there is plenty else to choose. Managers drinks are also served here for 2 hours each evening from 5:30, with free drinks from a limited menu but including cocktails. This is also popular and features live music three nights a week. On the Friday night, the band playing was fantastic and by the end of their session had people up dancing and singing along. A great night - and free!Staff are consistently friendly and helpful and maid service was good.My only criticism is the quality of the wifi. Apparently there was a repairman there on the last day we stayed and it did improve after that but before that, it was a weak signal, required constant re logging in and was basically unreliable. Hopefully it was only a temporary problem but should have been fixed earlier.Overall, if you are visiting Waikiki with a family, either young or old, then this is a very good option in Waikiki","Melbourne, Australia","andrewcK1965JL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",151,5.0

We had a one-bedroomed unit which had two double beds and a sofa bed in the lounge. The unit was fairly spacious with a good-size bathroom. The property is very well-run and efficient, with friendly staff, especially housekeeping staff. The room comes with a free breakfast which is adequate, with a fair amount of choice, although usually pretty busy. A tip - sit outside because the ventilation isn't great and if you sit indoors you smell of frying oil when you leave. The best thing about Embassy Suites is the location - it is a short walking distance to beaches, shops, restaurants and bus stops. You feel like you are in the centre of the buzz, which is great. The public bus system is excellent (download 'Da Bus' app), cheap and easy to use. One tip - we thought we would be clever and take a public bus to the airport - $7.50 for 3 people as opposed to at least $40 for a cab, and there are loads of buses that go to the airport. After dragging our luggage up the street to the bus stop we were told by the first bus driver that you cannot take suitcases on the buses. So we dragged them back to the hotel and caught a cab instead - it turned out that the next cab in line was a limo, which cost exactly the same as a regular cab but was way more fun. But it's useful to know this about the buses and I never noticed that anywhere online when I was doing my research.","Sydney, Australia","Belinda G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",31,4.0

Location was great, two minute walk to the beach, near many restaurants and ABC stores. The rooms are big which is perfect for families or large groups. Nice to have a separate living room with a fridge and sink. Decor was nice and rooms were clean. My first room faced the alley way and I was woken up the first 2 nights early by the garbage trucks as the glass doors were not very sound proof as well as the elevator was basically in my room. I asked the front desk if they could change this and they did! I was moved to an ocean front room with no noise in the mornings! Very happy with them. The breakfasts each morning were perfect, wonderful omelet station and lots of other hot and cold foods to choose from. The evening happy hour I didn't feel was really worth it. Yes free drinks but the food was zucchini and dip or chips and salty nuts/mix. I think stepping up a notch with the evening snacks would make this place an absolute #1 in my books! Pool area is OK, lots of chairs, good sized hot tub but a fairly small pool, not a big deal though. I did leave my battery bank when I left and returned a week later and they had it in lost & found! Very happy about that, however an email would have been a nice courtesy. The one thing that was frustrating was that the TV channel guide did not match up with what was on TV. Normally on a vacation this shouldn't matter, but I was a bit sick and the weather wasn't good, so I did spend time watching TV and correct channel info would have been nice.","Vancouver, Canada","eryn f</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",9,4.0

Our priorities were: a central location, close to, but not necessarily directly on the beach, and a reasonable (for Hawaii) value. The Embassy Suites Beach Walk hit the mark! We loved the extra space, microwave and small fridge, and the fact that both the bedroom and the living room each had balconies. Every staff member (save one) was extremely helpful, friendly and accommodating. Special kudos to Kenny, our valet/bellman and the front desk/registration woman (we forgot her name, but she was originally from Okinawa, Japan) who helped make our visit so pleasant. We booked a city view room and requested an upper floor to avoid the noise of traffic. We were assigned a wonderful suite, in the Aloha Tower, on the sixteenth floor with a glorious view of Diamond Head. We underestimated the value and quality of the breakfasts and thoroughly enjoyed the evening cocktail receptions. A block from the beach (the widest stretch fronting Fort DeRussy) and smack dab in what we consider to be the best part of Waikiki. The pool and spa are located on the fourth floor where we found plenty of loungers. If you're looking for a hotel with a grand lobby, this is probably not the place for you (reception was located on the ground floor and oddly open to where the cars and taxis arrive.)

Nightly cocktails was also excellent Cons: only complaint- we had to ask for our room to be serviced twice during our stay( they had apparently forgot) We also asked to be moved to away from the exhaust grill from the outrigger hotel next door. The smell was pretty bad (meat/deep fryer smell 24/7). So they moved us from 929 to 1429. Small improvement but nothing noticeable.

Wifi is fast, gym is good but a little small and the valet ($38/day) is quick in getting your car. Hotel does sit in a busy area but we had a 4th floor room and never heard the crowds around the hotel -- breakfast choices are typical Embassy Suites but area is open-air which is a nice touch. No resort fee which is hard to find (Hilton Waikiki has no resort fee also) so added value when staying here. As a Diamond member there were no benefits awarded us and no concierge lounge -- as evening social and free buffet breakfast included as part of hotel. We enjoyed stay and will be back for sure.Tip: Uber is available so no need for a car if you are to spend majority of time in Waikiki which saves you the daily parking fee of $38. Some come and only rent a car for the day they decide to drive around the island.Tip: Only a few rooms (high facing beach) offer a view as the hotel sits back away from the water and is surrounded by many other buildings -- so if you want the beach view and are willing to pay for it, make sure you reserve the room as busy and complementary upgrades are few.","San Antonio, Texas","Dean F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",397,5.0

I'll start with the good parts of this review. My husband and I spent 4 nights here before joining a small boat cruise on the Big Island. We thought it would be a good place to recover from jet lag after an 11 hour trip. We also wanted to see the sights in Honolulu as it's highly unlikely that we will return to Hawaii. The positives: The staff is very helpful and friendly. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. The cooked to order breakfast buffet has lots of delicious offerings. There is a great cover band at the nightly cocktail hour and cocktails flow freely. We've been to other Embassy Suite properties that impose a 1 drink limit. Now for the reasons for the point reductions: This is a tropical destination that was quite hot and humid when we were here. The halls and elevators are not air conditioned and there were no tropical breezes to make those areas comfortable. Sweating profusely while waiting for and riding in an elevator is definitely a negative. Additionally, this property is located a long block from the nearest beach. There is, however, a lovely pool area that would have been very nice to use had there been shaded areas. There were no umbrellas, except at a few tables, and no other shelters from the sun. We've been to many tropical resorts in many places. In all of them, we could sit at the pools or beach areas and be shaded from the sun.","Yardley, Pennsylvania","jerrilynr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Yardley, Pennsylvania</strong>",24,4.0

The room was clean and comfortable, the bedroom a bit on the small side but the living area complete with dining table and chairs was spacious. The housekeepers were efficient and very friendly, I thought all the staff were good that way. Part of the reason we booked this hotel was the included breakfast and happy hour. I thought the breakfast was pretty good, the chef cooked omlettes were great and poplular and while the range of food wasn't huge it was different every day. The happy hour by the pool was a great deal with a wide range of drinks, the snacks were pretty basic (nuts, veggies & dip and chips), and they have live entertainment a couple of nights per week. Hard to complain when the alternative is being back home at work! Location wise it is not quite in the center of Waikiki but pretty close and everything is in walking distance. Plenty of restaurants nearby (the hotel coupons have a discount for Cheeseburger Beachwalk which was a great spot for delicious messy burgers), and we enjoyed dining by the beach at the Outrigger Reef (where we met in 1989) accross the road. I would say this hotel is a great spot for families, there were a lot of kids there, particularly around the pool which some might not like but we enjoyed the atmosphere it created.

The only thing that needs improvement is dealing with the unsanitary conditions caused by the many birds going after your food in the outside 4th floor eating area during breakfast. We observed a large bird dive bomb a lady's food tray while she was eating. Another lady left her food tray on the table to go get something which allowed several birds to have a tasty breakfast of their own in her absence.

We chose the Embassy Suites Waikiki because of the Hilton quality, the location, the free breakfast and managers reception. The location is perfect for Waikiki Beach, restaurants or shopping.The only minor complaint was that the hotel was very busy and at times the elevator wait was long.I planned this trip in February. After booking the hotel, I called the Embassy Suites directly to ask questions about planning sightseeing activities. They transferred me to the Concierge Desk with an Expedia Local expert within the hotel for information. I spoke with Ross Asato and he was just great! Over the few months before we arrived, I emailed Mr. Asato many many times for information. He quickly responded and would add valuable information that made activity planning a breeze! So much so that I booked all of our activities on Oahu, The Big Island, and Maui with him. The evening that we arrived he had an activities packet completed and waiting for us, no waiting in lines!

We were in a two bedroom suite which was really convenient for the whole family. The two separate bedrooms are joined by a common area in the middle. There was also a working mini fridge (not lukewarm), coffee maker and a microwave. I think there was also a complimentary microwave popcorn but I'm not sure since it disappeared so quickly. Check-in was excellent as was check-out. The hotel was packed an always busy but we never really had to wait for anything. Unlike other hotels we have stayed at (I'm talking to you Royal Hawaiian). The rooms aren't luxurious, but they were clean, well maintained, quiet and had everything anyone could want. If you still need anything, there is an ABC store selling everything you might need right across the street next to the Denny's. We were fortunate to be there for the 4th of July and although we couldn't quite see the fireworks from our room, we figured out that by standing on the beachside terrace at the end of the hallway, we had a great view of the fireworks. The only thing we didn't like was the breakfast buffet. We were traveling with our kids who have food allergies. So our negative experience is only intended to provide information for other travelers with food allergies. At breakfast, we asked if there were any items that would be safe for them to eat given their allergies. Perhaps we asked the wrong person, but the waitress we spoke to wasn't sure and didn't inspire confidence with her response which was kind of a shrug and a general warning that pretty much everything was off limits. I assumed it was because of the potential for cross-contamination. We asked to speak to the chef or anyone else about it to get more specifics. The waitress then went and spoke to what I presume was one of the chefs and then came back and reiterated what she had said earlier. Not wanting to take a chance, we didn't really eat anything and skipped it entirely on the following days. That was the only negative I can think of for this hotel. Other than that, everything was very nice. The location is close to everything, the beach is a short walk away and the main shopping areas even closer.

The breakfast, which received mixed reviews here, really was quite decent, with plenty to choose from and a pleasant place to sit and eat, although it did become a mob scene by 9am. So, if you want to partake of the breakfast, plan to get a fairly early start. The rooms were standard hotel, but clean and comfortable and the hotel is nearly attached on one side to a long arcade of shops and restaurants which runs along Kalakaua Ave. Getting to Honolulu proper and its museums and other sights will cost you a fortune in cab rides, so take the city bus which is both reasonable and convenient from here. The concierge desk can arrange transportation to Pearl Harbor on a common van service which stops at all the area hotels.

Free drinks and snacks are served by the pool so kids can keep swimming which was a big plus.Location is great for shopping, beach etc (one street back from the beach, worth walking up further to where the Royal Hawaiian (pink hotel) is as there are no rocks or coral.

This location is within walking distance from the beach, shopping and food. However, if you want to go other places, catch the bus. It’s only $5 for 2 people, there and back. If you want to go other places the bus doesn’t travel, get an Uber. It is much less expensive than a taxi. We caught the bus to go to Wal-Mart, Walgreens and Ross (they are all beside each other) and the mall just to experience it. The prices in Hawaii and very expensive so don’t be alarmed. A gallon of milk is $8. The cost of living is extremely high. A 1,500 sq ft house, 3 bd, 2 ba is about $700,000.00 (learned this from Aldrin.) The post office is right up the street.

There were 3 adults so the apartment style room was perfect for us. And while it was a little dated a lot of places are in Hawaii! The room was perfectly clean. The bedroom was average size and while the living area was a little smaller than I expected it was still great having the separate bedroom where you could close a door when someone else was sleeping. The bathroom was really big!Having the mini fridge was really helpful. There was no cutlery though which was fine for us because we didn't use the microwave at all. The breakfast was nice. Nothing fancy but heaps of options and always plenty of food. Most hotels I looked at didn't include breakfast so it as great that it was included. The breakfast area was nice to sit in each morning and night at the manager drink. The managers drinks were amazing!!! I'm not a big drinker but even so it was a great way to get a little entertainment. Seriously such a point of difference and a super nice touch. Especially with the band on a few of the nights and they were great! All the staff were lovely. Saying aloha ever time we saw them. The young girl who checked us in was particularly lovely. Location! It was right in the heart of everything. Big ABC store out the front for everything you need. Only a few blocks to all the major restaurants like Cheese Cake Factory and California Pizza Kitchen (this was my favourite meal!) and shopping like Ross Outlet! About a 5 min or so walk down to the beach which seemed a little bit quieter than the heart of Waikiki beach which I really liked. All in all I would recommend this to anyone. Especially anyone looking for a separate room style hotel which is hard to find in Hawaii.Oh and free wifi is always good!

We've stayed at other hotels, but the Embassy Suites by far was the best due to the set up and location. We've previously stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and Marriott Waikiki Beach. Since we were traveling with our 16 month old baby, we needed the option of having the bedroom and living area be separated since we had already sleep trained her. Plus my husband is a snorer, and would've woken her up multiple times. Our room was beautiful and overlooked the pool, and you could see glimpses of the ocean. We loved the amount of space we had which is very rare for a hotel in the center of Waikiki. The free breakfast buffet was a huge plus since we had our baby with us. The food was always the same, but the buffet saved us some extra dollars to spend elsewhere. All of the staff (front desk, cleaning, valet) were really friendly, except for a few that would bus the buffet tables. You could tell that they definitely did not want to be there.The pool was nice too, and had a separate area for smaller babies and toddlers that was probably only 1 foot deep. I would definitely give this place 5 stars, if it weren't for the elevators. This hotel only had two elevators located by the front desk. There was one that was constantly breaking down, so that would only leave one for the mass numbers of people getting on and off. There would be swarms of people lining up for that one elevator. They were always super packed mostly with the morning rush, so we'd have to wait for a few of them to pass before we could actually get into one. There were times the staff would be nice enough to open up the service elevator for us though. Other than that one annoyance, we loved everything else about it from the service to the location and to the family-friendly nature of the place. We will be staying here again this November for our wedding! Excited to go back!!","San Francisco, California","Chanel K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",0,4.0

The have two bedroom suites you can get and have a wonder pool and other amenities for families. This is usually our go-to hotel whenever my family travels to Oahu. One of the best features of this hotel is that it is located near The Beachwalk Shopping area which is attached to the hotel via a tunnel. There are great restaurants and shopping options nearby. Our kids love the gelato shop and my wife is a big fan of the Starbucks which is also nearby for you coffee lovers. Access to the rest of Waikiki is also a breeze since the hotel is pretty centrally located. I'd recommend trying some of the local eateries that are within walking distance such as Arancino (italian food) or Giovanni Pastrami's (for sandwiches and breakfast). Rooms are spacious and clean. The only tip I would tell travelers is to stay in the Aloha tower on a high floor so you avoid some of the noise from the streets below. Also beware of the Trump hotel next door.

Usually we prefer to stay near the canal to avoid the busyness of Kalakahua Ave and surrounding area. However, the hotel was perfect in that we could not hear any outside noise once we were in our room. The air conditioning is loud and if you are a light sleeper you may want to consider ear plugs.The beds are comfortable though I would say the pillows could use an upgrade. I can sleep well regardless of pillows but the 8 pillows supplied in the room were getting old and felt lumpy. Location is very close to the beach and close to the shops and stores in Waikiki. My mother in law traveled with us and she does not wander far. However, because we were so close to restaurants and stores she was able to get out on her own and access the shops and stores she was interested in.Housekeeping was very good (Jin Un was the best) and with the exception of one day with a different individual cleaning our room we were very satisfied. A clean room is my number one priority when booking accommodation.We booked a one bedroom suite which suited us perfectly as either my husband or I had work to do some evenings. One of us would work in the sitting area while the other could relax or go to sleep in the separate bedroom. We chose Embassy Suites for two reasons: no resort fee and the complimentary breakfast. Breakfast was great! There was a very wide assortment of breakfast items which means that anyone from small children to adults can find something to eat. The only suggestion I would make is that there were no gluten free options for those who are celiac, though there was plenty of fruit, omelets made to order, and hard/soft boiled eggs could be requested. I would also love to see hotels offering whole grain breads, english muffins, etc., rather than the while breads that are always offered. The fitness centre had a good assortment of equipment (cardio and free weights). If there were more than 2 or 3 people working out at one time it became a bit crowded and hot! Despite a request to turn down the temperature, it was ignored and stayed at 72 degrees F. Whoever is in charge of the fitness centre should know that a cooler temperature is a must for a fitness room - especially with the small size and number of people who may be using it at one time. Each night free drinks and snacks were offered from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm on the grand lanai. On M W F there was live entertainment which we thoroughly enjoyed. The snacks were basic but were much appreciated by everyone from the looks of all those guests who were present each evening.I would definitely recommend this hotel. It's not cheap but we felt that we definitely got our money's worth.","Calgary, Canada","perryro</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",2,4.0

My original reservation was made six months ago via cashing in Airmiles points before they expired. That reservation was for a basic unit, but after I checked things out, including Trip Advisor, I realized I wanted a corner suite with an ocean view. Regretfully however, Air miles could not change that, and Hilton could not amend it either, as I did not book with them. A few days in advance I contacted the hotel directly and asked to pay for the upgrade and try to get the room I wanted, if one was available. On Check-in, they upgraded me for free, which was greatly appreciated. Stayed in Aloha Tower, Room #2008. The Aloha tower goes up to floor 21. Rooms that end with xx08 and xx09, are what you want. 10th floor and above for perfect ocean views from your living room, or your Lanai. Room service was prompt, reasonably priced and very good quality. Check in was a breeze, with sit down service and welcome juice. All sorts of shopping and dining out any of the exits.

Needless to say I don't travel very well and am always anxious when vacationing. I notice everything - every stain on the sheets, every smudge on the walls - that sort of thing. I was extremely happy to stay at the Embassy Suites Waikiki for our April 25 - May 2 vacation. We stayed in a room by the elevators on the 15th floor. We booked a city view room but we could see the ocean to the left of our balcony, so I think we were upgraded to a partial ocean-view. I was worried it would be noisy when trying to sleep, but because each room is a suite, you can close a second door to the bedroom to block out any noise from the hallway. Not that there was much noise in the hallway - this hotel seems to be a somewhat sleepy refuge for families in the middle of bustling Waikiki. You could hear the elevator itself going up and down through the wall - this was a bit annoying but we were able to muffle the sound out with the AC fan and earplugs (plus it wasn't running much at night). You could sometimes hear faint music/singing once the live entertainment got going around 5:30pm because they keep the door at the end of each hallway open to the outdoors/pool area, but it was quite pleasant and just added to the feeling that you're in Hawaii :) I actually felt comfortable in the bed - the white sheets were very crisp and clean, towels were clean, shower was fairly clean (very slight mildew in the grout in some places, but better than many other places we've stayed). Also housekeeping kept missing the full length mirror behind the bedroom door, so it was super smudgy and kind of gross. Also there was a bit of sand and some hairs in the corners of the bathroom floor when we arrived that never went away, so I don't think they did a very thorough job sweeping. That was really the only ""dirt"" I noticed!Staff were very friendly and helpful. Allowed us to check in a bit early, schedule a late check out, and use a courtesy room after we checked out and went out for the day (our flight wasn't until 10pm that night). I think our favourite part about staying here was the breakfast. Even when it was ""busy"" we only had to wait in line for a minute at the buffet, and another couple minutes to find a table. Most days we were able to grab food and a seat immediately. And it was good food too! Hot eggs, pancakes, made-to-order omelettes, bagels, oatmeal, cereal, some japanese-fare like miso soup and rice. It changed a bit every day, and there was a lot to choose from so we never got bored - we ate all 7 breakfasts here and saved a ton of money! More fresh fruit would be nice though, we only saw pineapple and honeydew offered. Unfortunately we never made it to the Manager's reception for the complimentary drinks and entertainment. Hopefully we will be back, and will be able to take advantage of that great opportunity as well!","Calgary, Canada","emilialis</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",4,5.0

I have to say that I was extremely relieved this hotel was as good as its reviews. With three kids we booked a 2bed/bath suite and it was perfect. Kids each had a bed and the second bathroom made everything easier. The added value with the full breakfast and happy hour were money savers for sure. Kids all enjoyed their breakfasts as did my husband and I. Staff are so helpful and friendly. Kids enjoyed the pool even though it's a pretty simple pool. The pool deck was never too busy and there was always a chair to sit on. If you're picky about shampoo/conditioner/shower gel, bring your own. Very comfy beds and pillows. Wifi was not so good, a bit spotty - kids did complain but hey, you're on vacation. My son could get free wifi courtesy of the Trump Hotel next door on the pool deck. The location is very good. Felt safe letting kids go downstairs and across street to ABC Store. Good restaurant choices all within close walking range. Can rent a car at hotel 1/2 block away and return it right to Embassy (extra $5 when returning to hotel, but so convenient). We booked a tour and again, went outside hotel 1/2 block for pick up. We were in the Hula tower and did not have an ocean view but we were rarely in the room or looking to sit on our deck. Honolulu hotels are expensive but the added value at this hotel with the room size, free breakfast and happy hour, it makes a family vacation more economical and less stressful.

At one point the housekeeping staff tried to push a large laundry cart onto the elevator which led to protests. The pool area is only ok with a number of broken chairs that should be removed. The included breakfast is a bonus for families. The extra room is convenient for a family. The proximity to the beach is about 200 metres.

Thank you so much, without those very accurate reviews I never would have found this wonderful Hotel for my family to enjoy.Check in very quick and easy (a cold tropical drink was a lovely start)Rooms clean and quiet, beds comfy.(We were near elevators and heard nothing).No resort fees (my friends got a nasty surprise when they checked into Hawaiian Village and had to pay over $200 for things that are complimentary here, and I paid less than them)Complimentary Buffet breakfast daily was awesome. Special mention for Aldrin (I think that's his name), he was always smiling as he cleared away and cleaned tables, folks please tip these guys as it's not as obvious to tip them as waiters in a restaurant but they do appreciate tips.Nightly Manager's Cocktail evening was a fav with our family. Just loved it and found it a great time to mingle and meet other guests from around the world.Lovely pool areaGood WiFiVery short walk to beach - walk another 5 mins past all the beachfront resorts to get to the main part of Waikiki Beach (Highly recommend DUKES, great service, food, prices and views - Try the Hula Pie).I highly recommend this property if you don't need to be beachfront. I will definitely stay here again when I come back to Waikiki and will recommend it to my friend's and family. Polynesian Cultural Center is awesome and worth every cent (pay extra for the Ambassador Package and take the bbq lunch that's offered on the shuttle ride there).We also enjoyed Yard House and Cheesecake Factory for lunch.Enjoy Hawaii...we can't wait to go again in a few years.",Gold Coast,"lolzgc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast</strong>",3,5.0

All the staff we met were very friendly and helpful, especially the reception staff who helped with phone calls when we realised we had left something in the seat pocket on the flight into Honolulu which we did manage to get back. As a family of 4 with kids aged 12 and 17 a suite was better than paying for 2 rooms in other hotels. We had a city room view, although it did have a great view of the ocean from the balcony!, with 2 queen beds in the bedroom and a sofa bed in the lounge area. My eldest had the sofa bed and he found it comfortable (and he is just under 6ft tall). having the extra living space along with a small kitchen area with fridge, microwave, tea/coffee facilities was great. The only drawback was that although there was loads of storage space with a wardrobe and many drawers once the suitcases had been emptied there wasn't really anywhere to put them.The free breakfast and managers reception in the evening were very good and definitely an added bonus. Another attraction of this hotel is that there are no resort charges. As a Hilton Honours member I looked at all their hotels in the area and this can out the best.Although not on the beach it is very close. We found that the nearest beach was a bit rocky once you were in the water but if you walk around 15 mins along the beach in either direction you'll find areas without rocks. I recommend the Ala Moana beach which is great for younger children. If you don't want to walk there take the pink line shopping trolley to the Ala Moana Centre for $2 per person which is close to the beach.It is also very close to the main shopping area and the zoo (around 20 Min walk) the aquarium is also around 30 min walk and gives a great view of Diamond Head.The hotel does not have a shuttle that runs to the airport but a taxi from the airport cost us $45 and slightly more going back as we went during rush hour so it took longer. Alaine on the bell desk was great at helping out work out the best time to leave and storing out luggage.Internet is free but does require re-logging on occasionally. There are plenty of sockets in the room for charging phones and the alarm clock also has an iPhone dock.Thoroughly recommend this hotel and if I am ever lucky enough to be able to go back to Hawaii this will be my first choice","Bristol, United Kingdom","carol b</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bristol, United Kingdom</strong>",18,5.0

Embassy Suites in Waikiki? Look no further for an incredible vacation package. We bought a week vacation package at Costco and the property, service, amenities and location couldn't be better. Way to go Costco and Embassy Suites. The hotel is ideally located across from the ocean front Outrigger Reef hotel (the beach sucks in front of their hotel so don't worry). Our lovely 2 bedroom suite (2 bedrooms and one central room) was quiet, on a high ocean view floor. Honestly, it was perfect. The room(s) were large, small compact kitchenette, excellent maid service, high powered aircon in each of the three rooms. I cannot think of any better accommodation for the $ in this area. Free breakfast, which included omelet bar and also free afternoon cocktails and chips, etc., at the pool. The pièce de résistance to all of this was ROSS at the concierge desk.

And this hotel was a fantastic part of that vacation experience. We had originally booked a king suite (city view) for our family of 4, along with arranging for use of one of their pack-and-plays for our 1 year old. That meant we would have the nearly 4 year old sharing our bed. So when we arrived at the hotel reception desk, we asked if it would be possible to switch to a 2-bed suite so that the oldest kiddo could have her own room. Cindy, a fantastic lady at the front desk, arranged for our new room with 2 beds. In fact, Cindy had given us a much better room, which turned out to be a corner room (extra windows) with an ocean view (room 1208). This was a fantastic surprise that really made our stay extra special.The room had a great view of the ocean, it was large, it was packed with extra towels for us as well as towels for the beach. There was a nice eating area (table and chairs) by the kitchenette. It was easy to close the door to the bedroom for the tired kids to sleep while we enjoyed the evening views.The hotel is quite near the beach (just across the street and down a short path). We had no trouble going back and forth. The hotel has a great pool (with a separated kids pool at 18 inches deep that both our kids loved even more than the ocean). The food was excellent. Part of our choice to stay at the Embassy Suites was due to their fantastic breakfasts. But we also got a very reasonable amount of food at the evening receptions as well (significantly cutting down on food expenses while there). Our only complaint is that the evening entertainment (live music) was often quite loud, which required sitting as far away from the music as possible for the sake of the kids.I would absolutely recommend this hotel and would use this hotel again on a future trip to the Waikiki area.","Olympia, Washington","civil23</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Olympia, Washington</strong>",68,5.0

The mayor and the city council must do more.3) Walls are paper thin - very unusual for an Embassy Suites4) MAIDS are extremely loud - at 7:30 am, they're shouting, ""Good Morning, Sir!"" ""Do you need anything sir?"" The GM must take these maids into a hotel room and shout outside the door to explain to them not to shout - why can't these simple things be done?

It's like having a FLASHLIGHT in your face all night. 6) No fitted sheets - so if you're over 6 feet and like to pull the sheets out, you're out of luck - everything unravels.

He even went so far as to lend us his own drink cooler for our many day trips and outings. The warmth continued when we met Pi'ilani at the ""all you can drink"" manager's reception. She ensured we were comfortable, treated us like long lost friends, and talked to us about everything under the sun. At breakfast time we were met by more friendly faces and one in particular stood out, Gerald. On our first morning there he was kind enough to give us leis made of dried kukui seeds. As with Dean and Pi'ilani, he made us feel at home. The hotel itself is very clean, beds are comfortable, and there are too many amenities to mention. The food is delicious and the drinks are strong. The pool area is a fantastic place to rest one's weary head after a day out and about.

Illegal narcotics is a felony and could have cost me my job and for the hotel staff to be so relaxed about the entire situation blew my mind. Upon check, I had to request to speak with the manager on Duty and all he did was deny responsibility and quiz me on how the narcotics ended up on my balcony. I did not appreciate that at all and he made no attempt to make any sort of amends or good faith gesture for the inconvenience. It was not my responsibility as a paying patron and a member of the Armed Forces to figure out how marijuana was smuggled into the hotel. That was/is his job and that would have been the appropriate time to take action. Take ownership of any situation. It is easy to pass responsibility on to the next party. The right answer is always “how can I correct this or make it better!” All I heard was it was another guest or other conspiracy theories on how this bag of marijuana magically appeared on my balcony. The details aren’t important but the experience is. The situation was handled poorly and unfortunately I will not be returning to this hotel. The ramifications of that situation could have cost me so much had it been found by someone other than myself and I don’t think the employees at your hotel understood that, which leads me to believe that illegal drugs being found in this location are common practice and that is unacceptable.

It is right in the heart of Waikiki, smack in the middle of all kinds of shopping -- from upscale, to touristy shops, to restaurants. Like a mini-, much more relaxed, Aloha-infused NYC. Asian fusion ABOUNDS at the little food truck plaza directly across the street. This was a lifesaver when we were tired after a long day sightseeing and didn't want to trek out in the car again for food. Ramen, Korean BBQ, sushi, delicious fresh fish... but, I digress. The free breakfast was the best I've ever experienced. Free breakfast is one of my favorite things about staying at hotels, so this says a lot! There were scrambled eggs and white rice daily, rotating tater tots and diced potatoes, several rotating meats from 2 types of sausage (links and round), to bacon, melon and pineapple, a made-to-order(!) omelette station, oatmeal with more toppings than I've seen offered anywhere, and of course. Steal and breads -- even salad and a miso dispenser. Love the Asian flair. Best of all, a real taste of island paradise was the Manager's Reception 5:30-7:30pm, nightly. There is live entertainment with a great ukulele band 3x/week, plus FREE drinks to put you in a tropical mood, while you watch the sunset from the rooftop pool area. Ugh, can you tell I want to go back? Complimentary newspaper is also delivered daily to your door. The only downsides: 1) $38/night valet parking, which was worth it to us to stay right in Waikiki and walk rather than struggling to find parking, at which we've failed at other vacations in the past. 2) We were in the Aloha Tower and the CONSTANTLY dinging elevators were really noisy, along with the banging from 6am deliveries on the street below (blessing/curse of ""downtown""), but they accommodated us and we switched rooms to a higher floor (20th), further from the elevator. PS- Roy's restaurant is next door and REALLY good -- not your typical ""screw it, let's just eat in the hotel"" place. Pro tip: Roy's has a Yelp deal to get a free SINFUL chocolate lava dessert if you check in! Pro tip #2: Ocean view is sooo worth it -- our 2nd room was a free upgrade and it was just bomb. (Pics made all our snowed-in friends jealous.) Thanks, Embassy Suites, for the memories, free music CD, cute fruity drinks at check-in.... All in all, I'll be trying to find a place to top this one for a long time to come.

Extremely talented musicians. The hotel suite was very comfortable with a little kitchenette and microwave oven which came in handy.The hotel is very conveniently located near all the main shopping centres and eateries - all within walking distance.There is also a convenient store across the road - ABC - which sells everything that you would need including some pharmacy stuff. They can even make up a fresh hamburger of your choice if you so wish.The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The hotel has a Business Centre (Room) with a number of computers which I had the benefit to utilise. There was a waiter in the dining area - so friendly & greets you all the time - and would always come up and asked whether he can help us with coffee or tea, etc., and with a big smile and always happy and jolly - pity that I didn't get his name.Overall, a marvelous hotel and lovely stay.

The reason we returned was because of the amazing included breakfast buffet and the nightly manager's reception (read: free booze (wine, beer, spirits, cocktails!) and plenty of it over a 2 hour period every night - with snacks!). A cold juice on arrival is a nice touch and all the staff are exceptionally friendly. A very special mention to Aldrin who works around the dining area at breakfast. I remember him specifically from our first visit and was so happy to see him and be served by him again. He is a credit to the company but also just a damn good person, heart of gold, keen to help and even once walked my wife and baby to the bathroom holding an umbrella because it was raining - and it was probably less than 10 steps in the rain! Champion human, hopefully his boss reads this and lets him know! For the keen gym goers the gym is actually pretty good for a hotel gym. Bikes, eliptical machines and 3 treadmills, swiss balls and ab machines, a cable station with 2 weights stacks which includes a pullup bar, 3 adjustable benches and dumbbells from baby weights to 55lb - not that heavy but good enough for a quick workout. The hotel is also in a great location - on the beachwalk with all of the shops and restaurants, adjacent to the Yardhouse, has an ABC (all purpose food/drink/supplies store) store directly opposite and is a tiny walk across the road to the beach. I would recommend staying here to anyone wanting to stay in Waikiki, and I'd stay here again next time we end up in this part of the world.","Sydney, Australia","Trips_with_the_Fam</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",44,5.0

We could not have made a better choice! It exemplifies the Aloha spirit.The staff (reception, Bell Desk, room, breakfast and pool) were always courteous, friendly and helpful. They regularly asked if we needed anything if they could do anything for us and as we left, all the various staff thanked us for staying with them. Their caring and attentiveness seemed genuine.The complimentary breakfast has many choices, including an omelette station where they will also prepare eggs any way you would like. The food is plentiful and we found that we could have a big breakfast and not need to eat again until dinner.The pool is very nice with an attached hot tub and wading area for small children. There are steps into the pool as well which makes entry easy for children and the elderly.The complimentary Happy Hour is nice. There is music, the drinks are free but the snacks are as advertised; ""light"". The light snacks consist of goldfish, chips, vegetables and dip, taco chips and salsa and similar items. Do not expect to have this be your light dinner. This is not a complaint but a clarification.Our room was plenty big enough. We had a bedroom with 2 queen size beds and a sitting area and bathroom. There was a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker and kettle. The room was very clean and we lacked for nothing.We had a partial ocean view room and it was great. We did not wish we had opted for the full ocean view. We could sit on our couch and look at the ocean; perfect! There was also a small balcony with a table and 2 chairs. We were on the 20th floor and didn't want to sit out there but it was nice to open the door and get a breeze.The hotel location was also very good. There are no resort fees because the hotel is not on the ocean, which is great, yet it is within easy walking distance to the beach. It is also very close to many restaurants and the Waikiki main shopping strip.There is an ABC store across the street which we frequented regularly for snacks, drinks, fruit, wine, etc. You could probably get almost anything that you might have forgotten at home here (sunblock, socks, ibuprofen....). It has lots of souvenirs too.On the day we checked out, our flight was at 10:00pm. We were able to get late checkout (1:00pm). They stored our bags for us and provided us with a courtesy room to shower and change in before we left for the airport. This allowed us to enjoy the afternoon at the pool and have a meal before leaving. We spoke to others who were doing the same thing. Another bonus for staying here.Overall, our experience at this hotel was excellent and we would definitely stay here again. I highly recommend it for all the reasons stated above.

We immediately requested a change, identifying ourselves as return clients and Hilton Honors members. I expected to pay for any change, given we had paid a package price, presumably, at a discounted rate. However, we were graciously offered an upgrade to a partial sea-view room on the 6th floor.

My most important requisites for a hotel are 1) a comfortable bed; 2) a powerful shower and 3) minimal outside noise. This hotel gets an A+ on 1 and 2 and our room location across from the Trump gives them a B because of the chirping noise made any time someone drove out of the garage ... probably an aid for the vision impaired. We were on the northern half of the north tower and still had a decent look at the ocean from our lanai/balcony. Housekeeping was discreet, excellent and efficient. We were always supplied with both bath and beach towels while additional towels were available from the pool. The breakfast was pure Embassy Suites with two of the best omelet makers around. With a large Japanese clientele there was a wide variety of choices, but always fresh fruit and healthy greens to go along with more traditional American and Japanese choices. Pastries were a little weak.The location could not have been better except that we were not on the beach. The walk to the beach was short however. Restaurants galore were out our front and back doors and all along the beachfront, both chains and local specialties. We were only a short walk from the arcade that allows you to stay out the rain and away from the vehicle traffic while walking a good portion of WaikikiActivities/Concierge desk was handled by Expedia. Ross and the team are top notch and well-versed on the activities on Oahu.

We did not use the pool but it looked very decent. We went to the Manager's Reception and alcohol was flowing - although not a big drinker, it was enjoyable. To me there was 2 minus: 1 - The price, but it is Honolulu and if I looked at comparables it was cheaper at some other hotels but smaller rooms and resort fees and no free breakfast. So I guess it is ok for Honolulu. 2 - The noise from the other rooms. We heard a baby crying many times, people screaming at each other, heavy walking...

A word for European tourists, you probably will not find another hotel with complementary breakfast in Hawaii in this price and star range. As others have already mentioned, complementary breakfast + evening reception make this hotel stand out among all Waikiki hotels. We stayed at 16th floor ocean view suite, which was big enough, although needs some refreshing as its resembled the 90's style. There were two balconies at the suite, quite small though. Our bedroom was literally next to the elevator, but we didn't hear any noise neither from elevators nor from the neighboring rooms, which was a positive surpise. The only minor issue was a shower gel and a tea spoon. I know, it is silly! But I couldnt understand why the housekeeping was providing soap bars (so 90's...again), but seemed to be missing shower gels; this was; however, fixed after 2 days of asking. I didnt get the tea spoon for my entire stay though; I had to bring it from the breakfast to stir a coffee. Dear Management, please fix this. You provide a coffee maker and hot water kettle in the room along with different flavored teas and cofees with sugar and milk, but nothing to stir it with. Additionally, I liked that I was not bother by anyone; my privacy was sacred and i didn't feel I was nickled and dimed.The hotel is very well located with many restaurants just a step away and the beach not far away.There is a small gym, laundry room.

I have been to Hawaii before in 2009 before but my family had not and I would highly recommend this hotel for families, couples, location and service. We had a two bedroom two bathroom apartment on the 12th floor with a balcony overlooking Beach Walk Rd and a view towards Fort Derussy Beach park and the water. Whilst we were not directly on the beach it was in easy walking distance to Grays Beach and Waikiki Beach and the main Waikiki area. Our apartment was fantastic and quiet with amazing beds. The breakfast every morning from 630am to 10am by the pool on level 4 was just beautiful with spectacular custom made omelettes and Buffett. A big shout out to the staff as well who really made my family and I feel so welcome every morning at breakfast - Dominic who made my omelettes just about every day, Rose who kept making sure my mum and dad were looked after and a big big thank you to Aldrin who was always checking we had plenty of tea coffee and water! The hotel was also in a great location for a great variety of restaurants with special mention to Shore Bird Restaurant across the road in the Outrigger Hotel on the beach, Bills for great coffee on Beach Walk Rd, Arancino Italian on beach walk Rd, Ocean House again on the beach in the Outrigger, Cheeseburger Beachwalk under the hotel and Denny's on Lewers street which is open late and does great comfort food. The hotel also does a fabulous free happy hour every night from 530pm to 730pm with complimentary nibbles by the pool. There is also a fantastic band which plays Friday, Saturday, Monday and Wednesday. This was definitely a memorable highlight of the hotel as you met so many different people staying at the hotel and a great way to unwind at the end of the day. Again a big shout out to Piilani who looked after us every night!Also another fantastic service was having an Expedia concierge in the foyer. I would highly recommend using Ross Asato who was in constant contact with me from Hong Kong and whilst I was staying at the hotel and was very patient and responsive to my millions of questions! Ross went above and beyond in helping me organise fantastic tours to Pearl Harbour, The Big Island, sunset cruise and Rockahula Dinner Show.All up I would highly recommend staying here and can't wait to go back!","Hong Kong, China","shimcahill</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",1,5.0

Expedia staffs the concierge desk and their job is to sell tours not to help guests with travel information.

Ala Moana Center is close too.Breakfast is the thing you cannot miss here. They have a made to order omlet station, fresh fruit, miso soup, eggs, sausage, coffee, juice, soda, and lots of other stuff. Make sure someone guards your food or the birds will come get it. I heard the birds are endangered so they cannot get rid of them. The staff is also pretty good at clearing away used plates. Make sure to come early as it can get busy.

The bad was the onion smell from nearby restaurants which was noticeable in the evenings ( I know not the hotel's fault but just so you know - it's not the ocean breezes I was hoping for) and the sofa bed which was truly awful to sleep on. It gave me lower back pain which persisted for several days and made my 9 hour flight home agony. The ugly was the tour desk's invitation to attend Hilton's timeshare presentation for 90 minutes in return for $150 off our parasailing trip. I know, I know, I shouldn't have fallen for it, but it was a waste of a couple of hours of our precious holiday time.

We were upgraded to an ocean view suite and had an amazing experience. Perfect location for beach, shopping or dining and a seamless check-in process.

The suite was large, clean and perfectly located to see the Hilton's Friday night fireworks. The ocean view was also amazing. Breakfast, as always, was filling, tasty and offered some of the best coffee I've had and the lomi omlette was a nice island touch. The bottom line is that you generally can't go wrong with Embassy Suites, and this hotel is no exception. It actually stands out above the rest, with nice touches like dining room coffee service and seating help and an excellent bell staff. When I needed to return to the airport to retrieve a bag, they actually called me a limo, which got me there in no time, for the same price as a cab. Can't beat that for service.

This property is my favorite Hilton branded hotel in Waikiki. I've stayed there about a dozen times over the past 14 years. Best Feature: No Resort Fee!! (A major reason why I started staying here. I hope this policy never changes)Location: Heart of Waikiki. Literally across the street from Waikiki Beach. Walking distance to world class shopping and restaurants. Service: This is THE REASON why I keep coming back. Front desk is always friendly and accommodating if I have a special request. Because of flight schedules I often arrive at 10AM-11AM but they always find me a room if my original one isn't ready.Check-in: always very easy. Front desk staff is fast, efficient and friendly. My pre-arrival requests were honored without any problems. I always look forward to the complementary welcome beverage at check-in, puts me in an Island state-of-mind!Hotel: I would classify this hotel as upscale business travel or high turnover vacationer so expect crowds and wait lines, especially at breakfast time. It has a modern feel with a contemporary Hawaiian design. The Grand Lanai area, pool and bar are very nice with a relaxed atmosphere and the staff is always friendly.The hotel and facilities are well maintained. Some minor issues associated with normal wear/tear you would expect but nothing I found worth giving a negative review. Room: all rooms are two or three-room suites, very spacious. I got upgraded to a corner suite with ocean view so had about 200 degree arc of view. Rooms facing poolside can be a little noisy but quiet down after 10pm. Not many rooms face the Blvd so not much traffic noise. The bed was very comfortable and linens were clean and crisp. Four pillows on each bed is nice. No problems with cleanliness. Plenty of extra power outlets conveniently placed about rooms; two on desk, each side of bed, table lamps, wet bar, etc. Only one USB outlet available which was on the clock radio by bed. Free WiFi available. Wet bar, coffee/tea maker, small safe, microwave oven and small refrigerator in room. Bathroom: slightly larger than the average hotel size. Two people could use it simultaneously and move around with ease. No issues with cleanliness. Nice selection of complementary toiletries. Three complete sets of towels. Good restaurant and bar on property. Prices were typical Waikiki hotel prices but not outrageous. At night the Grand Lanai area hosts the Evening Poolside Reception with complimentary drinks, appetizers, and live entertainment.Nice gym facility with good cardio equipment (treadmills, elliptical etc.) and free weights, open 24hrs.Valet parking only, $38 per day.

The rooms had everything we needed but it all felt like it needed modernising. Beds were comfortable and bathrooms well equipped. The balcony was miniature, the living room really wasn't large enough for a room that accommodates between 4 to 6 adults and it could have benefited from more wardrobe space. These things aren't major issues though given it is Waikiki and you don't spend a great deal of time in your room anyway.The wifi was very average as it didn't seem to like us all logging in at the same time. Breakfast is included in the room rate here but, to be honest, if it weren't for a couple of girls watching their money, I would have preferred to go somewhere else. There's something about buffets where different people of different cultures with different hygiene standards congregating around the open food, touching, coughing, sneezing, poking and prodding that puts me off eating. I also hate lining up for half an hour for an omelette. The service here is good and the location is great. Last time I stayed in Waikiki I stayed on the beachfront whereas this place is one street back but significantly cheaper and it really doesn't matter. When you go to the beach, I would recommend swimming out the front of the military base to the right, it's very calm, not many rocks, fewer people and heaps of turtles.

So, since there were going to be so many of us, we really wanted to stay as close to each other as possible....I contacted reservations weeks before and they were so friendly and helpful on the phone, and promised to try their best to accommodate our request, but due to the extremely busy holiday season they couldn't make any promises.I arrived at the hotel after about a 20 minute cab ride from the airport.....the cab fare was pretty hefty and I'd suggest taking Uber if you can....the fare is almost half. As we drove into the hotel driveway I was immediately greeted by the hotel staff who welcomed me and offered to help with my bags, but I didn't have much and could handle it myself. The hotel lobby is totally open....no windows separating the driveway from the lobby, and no AC.....just nice fresh Hawaiian air.Check in was a breeze.....Victor was really nice and friendly and took care of me, and apparently he also attended to my father earlier, but his room wasn't ready yet. Unfortunately, only my room was ready and my father's would have to wait till 3pm. I went up to my room and ohoh.....this is not what the room looked like on the website! I got a room facing the back...not a bad view....but the room had small windows, no balcony, and just dark and dingy like a dated motel room.....at first I thought no big deal, but then after a few minutes I started to feel really claustrophobic....I had to change rooms. I went all the way back down to the reception and spoke to Victor about this....he was really understanding and fixed me up with another room, but it wouldn't be ready till after 3pm.....no problem, I said.3pm passed and we had been sitting in the lobby for an hour or so...finally we were called that our rooms were finally ready! Yay! OMG! This room was so much better!!! The bedroom and living room both had sliding doors to balconies, and there was actually a very nice partial view of the beach and ocean! My father got the same room, but on a much lower floor and his view was even more awesome!....with a view of the pool too. The room still looked a bit dated, but it was much brighter so the dated look wasn't so obvious.....it was still very comfortable, clean, and well kept. I liked that they had flat screen TVs in both rooms, a low light bedside digital clock,, iron and ironing board in the cupboard, hot water kettle, coffee maker, a couple of glasses, a mini fridge, and some basic bathroom amenities. The bedroom and living room have separate AC controls, which is nice if you have someone sleeping on the sofa bed in the living room and prefers a different room temperature or fresh air by keeping the sliding door open. There is plenty of lighting in the room and what I found neat was that the lamps had 2 prong electrical outlets at their bases. And yes, there is a room safe for your valuables.About the location of the hotel, it just doesn't get much better. There is a mini market located just at the lifts at the Hula Tower (closer to the beach)....there's also an ABC mini mart across the road, and pretty much every corner of every block. But other than that, there are tons of all kinds of shops right at the hotel's doorsteps and within walking distance to the main happening street of Kalakaua Ave where you have tons of shopping, street entertainment, great restaurants, etc..... there seemed to be a at least a dozen Japanese restaurant at every block in Waikiki!Buffet breakfast was included and the quality and selection was quite good...I particularly enjoyed the fresh local pineapple and melons.....there's an egg station for omelets, but the line was always too long so I never got to try it. I stuck with the regular hot breakfast which included scrambled egg, breakfast potatoes, and the mix up offerings of French toast or waffles, or pancakes and sausages or bacon, etc....I liked the chicken sausages, but they aren't offered every day. The drinks station is located separately, and this was a good idea to relieve the crowding at the food area. The dining next to the pool, but it can get really packed depending on the time you come down for breakfast....a card is is provided in the rooms to tell you at what times are peak and what times are less crowded.There's also a small gym in the Aloha Tower which I used as much as I could....it had a bike, a few steppers/elliptical trainers, treadmills, a cable rack, dumbbells and benches, etc. There are a couple of wall mounted TVs in case you get bored on the machines.....the machines look quite new and are well maintained, but the personal screens are not hooked up to cable tv. There is a water dispenser and towels also provided.Wonderful experience, but I think this hotel is better geared to toward families with kids. My brother's family had a great time!Oh, consider the room you get as anything facing the pool you'll here the live band playing at happy hour.....with free alcoholic drinks and snacks.....nice touch.",California,"TravellingBanana628</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",68,4.0

Pool looked nice but we didn't try it.Was really close to everything - immediately downstairs are plenty of shops including a large grocery/convenience store (not part of the hotel) that carries drinks, snacks, souvenirs, etc. We used that for bottled water and soda for our room along with sundries.

The rooms/suites are very nice. The pool is very nice (begins receiving sun around 10am). We love the complimentary breakfast buffet with made to order omlettes. The cofee is disappointing (Duwe Egberts). It truly is a fabulous buffet but the problem is that dining is in a large open air room with birds flying around scarfing up food. I don't know how the Board of Health allows this to happen. For a solution we ate on the terrace outside. We also enjoyed the Managers reception with free beer and cocktails, and very good entertainment on certain nights. It is a wonderful time. Caution; if you rent a car the full day parking is $38. The Conciege (local expert) was very helpful in lining up our tours. Public transportation is near by and we will use it today to visit Diamond Head. The bus cost is $2.50.

Suggest not to go below Level 9 (which was our level) which has quite pleasant views through the buildings ahead (there are 21 levels in the Hula Tower), but any lower and I would think you would be missing out on some higher view aspects. The biggest down-side for me, was after you opened one of the two sliding balcony doors and stepped outside, you experienced that dreadful oil/fat cooking smell from the variety of restaurants located below. Complete gag material.The apartment itself was quite reasonable but not outstanding in any specific way. Smallish TVs, basic amenities in the bathroom with a tiny bathtub, and no cutlery or crockery in the kitchen. The bathroom could do with the addition of a magnifying mirror and fog-proof glass. Towels and linen were fine.Relaxed/coastal style furniture which looked somewhat aged in style, but in clean condition. Beds were pretty comfy and housekeeping came daily with no complaints - I accidentally left the safe open one morning and they left a kind message and nothing was amiss, which was very good of housekeeping and management.The breakfasts were o-k-a-y but not amazing as I found the eggs completely tasteless no matter which way they were cooked (fresh-egg omelettes or two fried eggs) but the setup was lean and orderly despite being relatively busy at most times of the service, except first thing in the morning. The hot buffet food is barely luke warm (never hot) so dont expect the food to taste great when it's sitting around for a while.Cant fault the location and this gets a 5 out of 5 - barely 2 mins walk across to the beach (go early to reserve your spot of sand unless you want to pay $20/hr for a sunbed (take your turkish towel as some of these looked a bit worn). Take your reef shoes if your feet are sensitive to shells/small rocks of any type.Hotel is right on the Beach Walk which was very handy and you can go through almost completely undercover walking through to Cheesecake Factory in the event of rainy weather.We spent some time at the Level 4 pool and I only wish there was a completely separate area for adults as the Kiddy-times which start promptly from 9am and finish well after the Managers drinks in the evenings, got rather tedious, as I would've liked some quieter times by the pool/spa without being splashed and the constant squealing. The other annoying pool-side quirk was the three oversize round lounge beds are alwasy taken - please make them have have a 2-hour limit that you can pre-reserve, as every day we arrived early and other pool-goers just stay on the beds continually all day long, without letting anyone else enjoy these great lounges. Half the time, the other guets we witnessed hogging these beds were sleeping completely covered up with towels all over the bodies, so not much sun-bathing going on in any case. All in all, a great stay and I would recommend families and others than dont mind kiddies all day long in the pool.","Sydney, Australia","meredithw787</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",26,5.0

Excellent price and no resort fees, just remember there is a charge for valet parking, nothing you can do about the high prices all over Waikiki. There is also room taxes and other taxes, approx. $30 extra to the room rate. I think this is the best deal compared to other hotels that charge a hefty resort fee. With this hotel you get a bedroom and living room, not just a basic room. I am not sure if it is a luxury type hotel, possibly mid-range but worth every penny. Eriko was pleasant and checked us in, we were given the refreshing tropical drinks. Yummy, what a nice touch, great first impression of things to come. I like how you can sit down when you check in instead of stand in a queue.There's also complimentary infused fruit and herb water in the lobby every day. We stayed in room 1101, Aloha tower. Our room overlooked the food trucks area below, Ft. DeRussy park and all the high rises. We were next to the elevator and it is a one bedroom suite. Spacious, comfortable, sofa bed and TVs in the bedroom and living room. I usually bring my power strip because other hotels lacked outlets to plug in all my electronics. This hotel had outlets on every lamp and the alarm clock was easy to use. The room was very clean and had a mini fridge to put in refreshments and snacks. Room also comes with a microwave. We put the AC on during our stay because even though it was super windy, it was a bit humid. I also sleep with ear plugs so I really didn't notice the noise of the elevator. I rarely heard the elevator come up to the 11th floor after 11pm. There was a local newspaper outside my room every day, a nice touch to read about what's going on in the islands. The best part of staying here is the breakfast buffet every day (included with room rate). Every morning the servers and bussers were very friendly and helpful in asking if everything was ok, did we need our water or juice refilled, etc... The omelette guy was very talented, flipping the omelettes and cooking them really good. Nice touch to have some sriracha on the side. I was also wowed every day when there were different breakfast items to choose from. Again, refreshing tropical drinks, hot tea, coffee you can make and take to go, flavored sparkling water. Everyone was helpful. Since we are 2 hours ahead of Hawaii, we were at the buffet at 7am every day and there was never a big line for the omelette station or the other breakfast selections. Lots of seating as well. Yes, the earlier you go to the buffet, the faster you can eat and get on with sightseeing or whatever. The manager's reception for drinks and entertainment on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 5:30pm to 7:30pm. Keola the bartender was hustling, making few drinks at a time, very good drinks, kept everyone entertained. When his line got a bit too long, we walked past the pool to the other bar. No line at that one to get drinks, shhh! Maybe other guests didn't want to walk all the way to the other side but I didn't want to wait in line. I liked how the entertainment changed as well and kids were allowed, making it a fun family atmosphere. The buffet and reception are located on the 4th floor in Aloha tower, so I am glad we stayed in this one as it was a quick walk down the hallway. Pack light because there is a laundry room on the 3rd floor, at the end of the hallway past the gym. The wash is $3.25 and the dryers cost $3.50? Bring quarters or pay with debit or credit card. No change machine inside this laundry room. I packed some Tide pods in my suitcase (I always do my laundry on vacation, lol) anyways, there are signs saying no powder detergent. Mini liquid detergent is also for sale in a vending machine (bring quarters) I think these cost $1.25? There's also a table and chairs to lounge while waiting for your clothes and also snacks and soda machine. I appreciate how this property ensures safety for guests. The room key is needed to access the laundry room, room to your floor and even the lobby bathroom. The women's last bathroom stall had a bidet! OMG! I never tried it before, TMI but wow, warm toilet seats and all, they have thought of everything. I felt safe during my stay even though the lobby area is wide open. I can't wait to book another stay here at Embassy suites Beachwalk!

The rooms are bigger and your much closer to the pool, bar and breakfast lanai. This is a really great deal if you are military, retired or a GOV civilian. Government / Military rates are sporadic and really blind luck if your able to get the rate.

I cannot believe that management did not pass on the excellent reviews to Ray and I know that the guests leaving the reviews would be appalled to know this! I read some of the many reviews out to Ray who had tears of gratitude and I believe a sense of relief that his hard work and beautiful demeanor wasn't going unnoticed. Higher management, please pass on the reviews to staff when mentioned on here and especially to Ray! Isn't obvious that when staff are acknowledged for their hard work and rewarded they continue to be happy and productive employees.

These included the Outriggers (both of them). But this was clearly the best hotel have stayed at on the island. We always arrive on the early flight from Melbourne and I know that some hotels will hold your bags until check in (2-3pm) and not sway from this. However, despite the hotel being full the staff provided a nice refreshing drink on arrival, provided us with vouchers to the buffet breakfast upstairs and towels to lounge beside the pool. At 11.00am we were then told that they had cleaned our rooms and we could check in.We had thee bedroom suite with city views. I was amazed at the size of the suites and knew we'd made the right decision as soon as we entered the room. 2 queen beds were in one spacious room and then there was a living area with a sofa bed, table, mini fridge, coffee making equipment, TV, safe etc. The rooms were spotless, bathroom immaculate and 2 balconies.The beds & pillows were so comfortable and enabled us all the have a great sleep after long days tours, swimming, shopping etc.There are a few things which made this hotel very different. There are a lot of hotels that have a 'resort fee' hidden away until you check out. These vary from between 15USD to 30 USD per room per night. You get very little for them.Embassy Suites had no resort fee but even still you get certain extras that other hotels don't provide.1. Free breakfast. Cooked omelettes, fresh fruit, bacon, sausages, hash browns, cereals, breads/bagels etc. This can save a family $30USD a day.2. Manager's reception beside the pool. Free complimentary drinks (including beer / cocktails) between 5.30-7.30 every night. And boy weren't the cocktails potent! No watering down on these drinks. 3. Wi-Fi was fast and reliable.All in all, we had a brilliant trip staying here. I would find the extra dollars and look no where else.

We had a similar problem at the embassy suites in saint Petersburg Florida apparently the Hilton doesn't value maintaining all elevators so that guests do not have long waits whenever they need to go someplace. Overall I would recommend this hotel for a very nice stay in Hawaii. ","Columbus, Ohio","TravelLightDot</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Columbus, Ohio</strong>",20,4.0

The location is good with multiple restaurants in very close walking distance, but unfortunately the hotel really only has city views. If you keep in mind that you receive free breakfast and 2 hours of free drinks every night, the price isn't too bad. When booking, definitely watch the pricing. I was ready to book, and the price went up during that process from $279 a night (for 2) to $578 a night. I kept looking and was ready to book elsewhere, when the price dropped back down. The only other issue was that we were thinking about bringing our daughter, but the price rose over $100 a night.","Roseville, California","Dion W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Roseville, California</strong>",1,4.0

We stayed at the Embassy Suites for one week and paid for a Partial Ocean View Room. We received a lovely drink on arrival. Check in was quick. We got a top floor suite in the Aloha Tower which we were stoked about!! We had a lovely view of Diamond Head as well as part of the ocean through some buildings. I knew this building was located one block back from the beach so I still got the view i expect us more.. I thought it was a treat to have a view of Diamond Head! Note: you can also go onto the balconies at either side of the building on your level. For us this meant we could take a look overlooking the pool and the at the other side of the building overlooking the city buildings.The suites are awesome.. I booked this hotel because i wanted the decor to feel Hawaiian. I wasn't interested in a modern hotel room. The rooms were very clean and in my opinion well decorated! Loved the palm tree sheer curtains! Breakfast. FREE. What's to complain about? They alternated the pancakes and french toast each day otherwise it looked the same to me. Fresh pineapple everyday, yum. As a suggestion only; It might have been nice to have some plain low fat greek yogurt as a healthy alternative to the strawberry/berry/banana yogurts. Plus more of a variety of cut up fruits each day. As I said though, I'm not complaining.Evening drinks. Also Free! 5:30 -7:30pm. Great variety of drinks. We just had Mai Tais...delicious. A variety of snacks you can nibble on. Room service although great, came at a different time each day. Once at around 9am (bit early if you are having a sleep in?) And another time after lunch. Didn't bother me, just commenting as Ive read reviews that have commented the same. Consistency would be nice for some people I am sure.Pool. It was closed when we checked in. I won't lie, I was disappointed as we weren't told about the maintenance upon booking or prior to our arrival. They gave us access to the pool at the Outrigger across the road. Luckily for us though the pool reopened sooner than expected and perfect timing for us as a pool day was planned that following day. Beach access. Easy. Across the road down the pathway. Or walk down to the main beach area of Waikiki.Free wifi in room. No resort fees. Close to shops and restaurants. ABC store across the road from hotel is apparently the only one that has the Dole Whip (pineapple ice cream) according to one of my tour guides..another win! In conclusion; Definitely staying here again in the future. I had been to Waikiki before and stayed at the Hilton Hawaiian Village and the Royal Hawaiian. Obviously the Royal Hawaiian is a prestigious hotel. The Hilton Hawaiian Village is great also but Embassy Suites offers a wonderful location, no resort fees, free wifi, free breakfast, free evening drinks... Awesome stay!

The view from our room at night was spectacular with the lights of the city as a back drop. As we were out most of the time an ocean view was not important to us. The bed was super comfortable and we both slept well. There is a mini kitchen with a microwave, fridge and sink. We loved the breakfast that is included and we were spoilt for choice with food ranging from cereal to a hot breakfast and everything in between. The wait staff were super friendly and helpful. There is also a gym and a laundry at this hotel which came in very handy on a couple of ocassions. This hotel is a family friendly hotel and there were families with children ranging from almost birth upwards. There is a beautiful pool area with shade umbrellas available and a children's pool, although halfway through our stay they closed the pool for maintenance. But it was more than made up for by the fact that the hotel had made arrangements for their guests to use the Outrigger hotel pool. Happy hour at 5.30 pm was our favourite time of the day. Free drinks and cocktails until 7.30 pm along with nibbles. The hotel is very central to everything - beaches, shopping, restaurants and transport. You could also book buses at the bell desk if you needed to go places such as the Waikele Outlets for shopping or Pearl Harbour. We even walked one street over and caught a trolley bus to the Ala Moana shopping centre. The trolley buses are very convenient and very cheap. The recreation booking desk in the hotel was also very good and helped us to book a day tour around the island with Huka Tours. We had a fabulous day and visited the Dole Pineapple Plantation, had lunch at the Polynesian Cultural Centre and stopped off at many points of interest on our way around the island.

Close to places to eat and shopping.Price - A little spendy but expected staying in Hawaii. Room - Very clean and updated. Had no issues with noise in the room. Kids loved walking on the balcony and looking at the ocean. Not an amazing view but you could see it from the balcony. Food - The breakfast area was always clean and plenty of seating. There was a lot of people during breakfast but the food was always stocked. Never had an issue. Tables were cleaned quickly as guests left. The evening drinks and snacks was a great way to end the day. The live entertainment was great and the kids loved listening to the band. The snacks usually included pretzels and goldfish. Nothing too exciting but it was standard snack items kids would enjoy. The drink options were limited but was okay. Staff - Nothing over the top for front desk. Those working the breakfast were always friendly and helpful. The bartenders next to the pool were also friendly and made for a welcoming area. Overall - Open area from lobby to the elevator leaving outside traffic to walk around. In order to take the elevator to your room you had to have a key. That became an issue when one of us was waiting on the other. You were stuck standing by the elevator waiting for the other person. While outside walkers were with you basically just checking out what the area was. Downfall - There was a lot of homeless people sleeping around the property in walk ways.

We also saw a lot of couples and I personally don’t think you can come to Waikiki and not expect families at your hotel – especially since this one has free breakfast, 1 and 2 bedroom suites, and a free happy hour – what’s not to love! The hotel itself is more up to date than I thought it would be. The room was very nice and had a Hawaiian feel to it. The mini kitchenette was more than adequate with a fridge, microwave, and sink. The room also had a desk and chair, a sofa and side chair plus coffee table. We had 2 decks off our suite. The bedroom had plenty of space for our pack-n-play that my toddler son slept in. It also had more than adequate storage including an armoir and dresser plus another TV! Our room must have been upgraded – Hula Tower 2032- ask for it! It had a great ocean view and was quiet even though we were next to the elevator. Avoid floor 4 through – that’s the floor for the pool and breakfast area – I imaging that floor would get loud. The hotel has an amazing happy hour that is essential a 2 hour open bar!! Every night we went at 5:30 on the nose, to grab a drink before dinner. It was a little hard with the time change and a toddler – he was super tired at dinner at night and he woke up for 2 days before 5am, finally on the last day he slept still 6:30. It’s fine though since then you can get breakfast before the crowds and be ready to hit the beach early! The pool was closed while we were there but we made do since the beach was super close and the pool next door was literally a 1 min walk away (don’t listen to the complainers below). They opened the pool a few days earlier than expected and it was open on our last day but we didn’t even use it. The location is ideal – walking distance to everything! Lots of cheap restaurants too – we found a bunch that we liked – there’s spam musubi shop nearby, several amazing ramen spots too. We liked AGU ramen, Ramen Nakamura and Aloha Table. The food court in the plaza next door had great burgers (Mahaloha burger) and yummy desserts. The main Waikiki beach is really nice despite being busy. We rented a standup paddleboard for an hour ($25) and took turns on it – we both got to see sea turtles swimming! My son enjoyed playing in the sand for hours at a time! If you walk down the beach to the sea wall, there is some structure near the wall that you can snorkel around and see a few fish. We love snorkeling but with a toddler we don’t get many opportunities to see fish!We also rented a car and parking was expensive ($38/day) but it allowed us to check out a bunch of other amazing beaches. Lanikai was our favorite. We also went to Kailua next door. And we did a bunch of beaches on the north shore which were less ideal for toddlers. We did see more turtles there though! Overall I would definitely recommend this hotel for families or really anyone wanting a convenient location with plenty of included amenities. We stayed at the Hale Koa (military hotel) with my parents before and it was also nice, but this was even better! Just check for when the rates are decent and be aware that parking is expensive.

Our arrival was met with a box of chocolates to help us celebrate our 20th anniversary, we are upgraded to a 2 bedroom partial ocean (I'd booked a one bedroom ocean view). the rooms were spotless, and spacious for all our luggage. I cant fault anything with the room and all it's amenities. The staff were so friendly and willing to provide you with an exceptional holiday .. and they did.There is only one thing that I think would be nice to see... Vegemite for us Aussies at breakfast!!there's a huge Japanese influence for breakfast and considering us Aussies are flooding Hawaii continuously throughout the year, I think it would be great to see the only item I can think of that I did miss whilst overseas.. Vegemite. Special mention to Lewis, thank you for my Chi Chi's around the pool. Also the lady that looks after room service, again exceptional service and brilliant people.we'll be back ..

We stay at Embassy suites across the globe (GOLD Honors member) so we know what to expect. In fact, I've stayed at this particular hotel 4 times previously with no problems. This time, EXTREMELY disappointed. So here's my view of the ""Goods"" and the ""Bads"" for this past week.Goods:(1) Easy access and close to the beach(2) Breakfast and nightly happy hour included (I'm not stating ""FREE"" because I'm sure we pay for it in the cost of the stay).Bads:(1) Booked in May, arrived Saturday afternoon 10/15 and was told the pool was CLOSED. We should have been advised prior to arrival and given options to cancel or relocate. When asked, many of the employees themselves did not know until a day or two prior to it closing. How can one go to Hawaii and the pool be closed for the entire week? Although they offered a pool at a different hotel across the street, it would have been very inconvenient to transit back and forth, especially if we needed something from our room. We decided to forego the offer to use a different hotel's pool and did the beach instead.(2) Every time we retrieved the car from the valet, it arrived with more dents and scratches than when it was turned over. Significant scratches.(3) Visitors with LARGE inflatables crowded the small elevators night and day making it difficult to comfortably and conveniently reach the room. When we approached the manager, we were rudely informed that Hawaii did not have laws against bringing inflatables on elevators. Ok, we get that....but shouldn't the hotel think about applying a local ""Hotel Policy"". Either take the steps, or deflate the toys prior to getting into an elevator for the convenience of other guests.(4) The hotel was crowded with kids running and screaming all over the place, in the dining area, on the patio, in the hallways, etc. I know this is not the responsibility of the hotel, but it certainly made the stay less enjoyable.(5) Upon returning to our room one evening, we exited the elevator and were met with someone's dirty, sandy shoes, and laundry laying in the hallway. Again, not the hotel's fault, but really? That's just gross.(6) We asked to speak to a manager about all of the above, and were met with a ho-hum yawning attitude. We were informed we needed to speak with the manager the next morning.(7) Next morning, asked for the manager. Advised him of our concerns and informed him we had decided to depart 2 days early (hence, this is why I regretted pre-paying because we lost 2 day's stay at $239 a night....nearly $500 down the drain). His response to us....""Ok. You're all checked out. Bye."" Now that's Customer Service (not). Additionally, we had to pay 3 nights at another hotel because of our disappointment in this Embassy Suites. Another 3 nights is not cheap on top of what we lost by moving early from Embassy.So, would I recommend this hotel again? Maybe or maybe not. If the hotel values its customers and customer service, they should review their policies and make a few changes.","Chesapeake, United States","Dana L</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chesapeake, United States</strong>",5,2.0

The free breakfast daily was good - reasonable freshness and variety, and very convenient. Bills Sydney is just down the street (about 200m walk) if you need a 'real' coffee. The accessibility to Waikiki shops and the beach was good. A short, easy walk. Our kids are 6 and 8. And they are happy with just the beach, so we only need to carry a room key and a towel each. There's a free Managers Reception each night. This involves 2 hours (5.30-7.30pm) of a basically open bar (free cocktails, beers, juices, etc) and snacks (nachos, breadsticks, carrot sticks, dips). Some nights there were big lines. Some nights were quiet. They also have the kitchen open, which made an easy dinner option after a big day. The hotdog and cheese pizza were winners. So was the grilled chicken and veg. The spring roll appetizer was extreme (see photo).Only frustration with the dining was some mornings at breakfast they were really slow at clearing and cleaning. And some nights it was near impossible to find a server to place a menu order with. The room itself was good. It had a lounge/dining space with a sink and bar fridge. The bedroom had 2 queen beds.

We enjoyed our last 9 night stay here so did not even look at alternative locations for our recent 9 night stay in Waikiki. I must say that we were extremely disappointed this visit and found that standards have slipped significantly.I'll start with the positives.. Breakfast and evening drinks are included in the room rate. Housekeeping service was excellent and our Housekeeper quickly learnt our routine and cleaned around it. She was great! The location is as good as you can get in Waikiki - close to everything without being over-crowded. The rooms are an ok size. Valet and Bell Service were very positive and helpful and the team who worked the breakfast were happy and friendly. Pool area is nice but shade is limited.Unfortunately, the negatives outweighed the positives for us. We arrived a 2:55pm from another island and were told our room was not ready but would be ready in 5 minutes. We were then left waiting for 35 minutes with little care factor from the front desk. In fact, every dealing we had with the team at the front desk ended with us feeling disappointed and upset. We never received our welcome bag. The bag would have come in handy. The quality of the breakfast has declined and we found one of the omelette cooks did not know how to cook an omelette. Being Australian, we learnt from our last visit and brought Vegemite with us so that we could have toast each morning. Pool side service was slow (if any was provided). Advertising states a kitchenette. This is little more than a teeny fridge with a basin and microwave that doesn't work. No crockery or cutlery provided. Probably deceptive to call that a kitchenette... WiFi was simply awful. If you need this to work or it is important to you, stay elsewhere. It was frustrating having to log back into the system with passwords every time you wanted to access WiFi and then wait 30 minutes for a couple of emails to download.I also hate to say it, but many of my fellow guests would leave their children at the pool for hours at a time unsupervised and as there are no hotel staff present, nothing was done and the kids running wild impacted the safety of other children in the pool and the comfort of other guests. On check out, they stuffed up our room charge and then charged us twice. The girl on the desk clearly did not know what she was doing. Whilst we managed to get this resolved about a week later, the entire incident ended up costing us an additional $300 in currency conversion fees and lost currency rates. This was not about holds on funds (which is standard hotel practice). They do take random holds on your funds throughout your stay of amounts that do not make any sense - we never queried this. I was left feeling extremely unhappy with the way the situation was handled and could not trust them to conduct any more transactions. Please ensure you check all transactions they conduct against your cards.Do ask for a higher floor. We had no major issues from noise on the street. Sadly, it is unlikely we will ever return to this hotel and whilst we are planning a return to Waikiki, I have begun researching alternatives.","Melbourne, Australia","Katabout</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",95,3.0

We were able to check in about an hour early if we went for a lower floor. We opted to do so it was the 12th floor. We did still get woken around 6:30am by the rubbish trucks as we were city facing but it wasn't too bothersome. Probably the higher you go the better this might be. This was the end of our stay after been to Maui & other end of Waikiki, so great to have breakfast included for convenience. We didn't find it too busy at breakfast. Kids loved the pool. And spa was great too. Strong smell of chlorine on our togs after but better that than germs! Elevators are slooooow. Don't expect to get anywhere in a hurry. LOVED location after staying right down other end of Waikiki much preferred this end by all the great restaurants/shops. Roy's is practically in the lobby. And beach isn't too far. Check in was easy, we didn't have big cues like other hotels. Options for families can be more limited in Hawaii i.e. Getting 2 bedrooms etc can be hard/expensive. And did lots of research. Embassy isn't cheap, we were able to cover some with air miles which helped but there's no doubt having 3 rooms i.e. 2 bedrooms, a lounge & 2 bathrooms was great for our family. We booked about 4 months out but lots of the more family type hotels were already booked out so my advice is to get in early. We were more than happy with embassy though, despite the price (we're paying in NZ $ so everything's a bit more expensive for us anyway)","Auckland, New Zealand","Hapholidays</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland, New Zealand</strong>",25,4.0

With the whirlwind of graduation, getting him ready for college and everything in between, this review is long overdue (since we stayed earlier in June), but the service at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk was by far the BEST all around service we have ever experienced and they deserve an EXCELLENT review.When I began looking for a hotel in Waikiki, I soon realized there are very few that offered the amenities we were looking for. This Embassy Suites seemed to have everything we wanted: two queen size beds (difficult to find in Waikiki) in a separate room; a sofa bed in the living room; an ocean view (this means we were able to sit on our sofa and see the ocean through our window); not one, but two lanais; a pool; a complimentary full breakfast buffet with a wonderful omelet station; an evening reception with snacks and drinks (including alcohol); centrally located to everything; and no resort fees. The Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk is well-appointed and an outstanding value for your money.The amenities are wonderful, but the hospitality is even more superior. From the first time I called to make the reservation (with Malia Espinda, Guest Experience Manager) to the moment we were departing the property, we were treated with the essence of the Aloha spirit and felt like family the entire stay. Malia did not announce herself on our call as a manager (I only learned that later when we arrived), she simply took great care to answer all of my questions in a friendly way and did not make me feel like I was bothering her at all. Based on that call alone, I was even more excited about our upcoming trip. In addition to Malia, all the staff persons we encountered were fantastic. However, there are some I would like to recognize by name because, like Malia, they took extra good care of us. A special thank you to Jay and Cindy at the front desk for the regular aloha greetings and laughs; to our housekeeper Angela who made sure our room was tidy and well stocked; to Aldrin and Cary for welcoming us to breakfast and offering island tips for ways to spend our days; to Bryan for happily making great omelets and eggs to order; and to Keoni at the Bell Desk for sharing great tips for Pearl Harbor, including transportation. In fact, Keoni went the extra mile to have breakfast-to-go meals ready for our family one morning because we had to leave extra early for an excursion and did not have time to enjoy the breakfast buffet.It’s the exceptional service at the Embassy Suites Waikiki Beach Walk that made this family vacation exceed our expectations; it’s not very often that you arrive not knowing anyone and leave feeling special like you’re family. The next time we return to Waikiki, we will only stay here.

Checkin is actually an enjoyable experience, staff are attentive and friendly and actually care about their job. One nice feature about the checkin in the tropical feel of the checkin area and the complimentary tropical drink that is served to all guests. (Non alcoholic - sorry booze hounds :P) The bell boy doesn't ask for a tip, even with a family of massive and heavy bags. (you still should give him a few $ anyway though)The rooms are nice with a balcony (Which is the first thing to be barricaded off from my infant and 6 year old. The rooms include a decent bathroom with an empty vanity, hairdryer, and a shaver? The shower/bath has a nice little system to alternate between the systems which can be a bit finicky (the water can come from the bath tap instead of the shower head.) but overall, it was pretty nice, temperature can be adjusted precisely, (I like very, very hot showers and occasionally freezing showers and both can be achieved.) the water pressure however, isn't really anything to rave about. Pressure can drop a massive amount if all the taps are on in the double room (two rooms join to make one massive one.) but it is usually manageable. The room layout we had is called the ""Grand Lanai"" (with balcony and double rooms) which includes a living room/kitchenette and balcony, flanked by a bedroom on either side. I HIGHLY recommend that you dead-lock the bedroom doors if you like to sleep late (until 10 or 11 or so) as the maids can come in accidentally and that isn't a fun way to spend your holiday. I don't sleep in so I really don't have anything to worry about, just a heads up. One gripe I had about this hotel is the elevators, there is two of them for everyone in the hotel. (theres a staff one, but you cannot get into that too easily ;) Wait times at the elevators can be a few minutes as they aren't rockets. Just plan your elevator trip carefully! ;PThe dining area offers a full buffet breakfast with a two chef's manning the omelette stations. The food includes breakfast staples - all of them, fresh fruit, spreads, (please have Vegemite, I'm Aussie and NEED Vegemite - it's also fun to see people who aren't used to the taste, go and try a big dollop of the black Aussie delicacy and spit it out in disgust - you would know how funny it is if you're an Aussie) and a variety of juices, water, ice, soft drinks and tea/coffee in a separate booth. The hall where you eat has a MAJOR PROBLEM, though, if you take your eye off the food for even a second, it gets commandeered and eaten by the birds instantly. There is a area for families the is separated by a door but that is small and I don't really like it! This area as well as the pool area mentioned below has a live band playing there every night.The pool/spa area is usually quite empty (why would you like to go to a pool when you are at the Surfing and beach capital of the world?) and has a bar/cafe right next to it. Food is nice overall. If you go to reception and go down the corridor out of the building, you will be on the main drag, with shops, food courts and everything else around you.Overall, it is a great hotel and has many nice features, a few area that need improvement but I would recommend it to anyone without thinking twice!","Sydney, Australia","zdj777</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",4,4.0

On a Friday night, a live band played during happy hour and you could see glimpse of the fireworks show from the other hotel. Near to restaurants, clubs, stores and beach that your really didn't need a car if you're just hanging in Waikiki. Watched football at Giovanni Pastrami and they had free pizza during happy hour.

Our room faced the city and its okay. Balcony kind of small but really spent our time outside our suite exploring Waikiki. Our room had a mini fridge, sink, microwave and coffee pot. Enough to store our drinks and leftovers. Pool is okay, but rather be on the beach anyways. Slept like a baby even if our room was next to the elevator.

Room was comfortable and had good views after a little bump at the start as my hhonors preferences were not loaded on reservation it was all sorted and the vacation could start. Breakfast was hectic in the mornings (summer peak to be expected) look out for the hungry birds in the outside deck areas they will take their chances to grab a bite off your plate if they are not tended well. Pool was great got our two young boys but pool side deck chairs were in hot demand early on. The staff were great to reset deck chairs when they are not being used. Makes it easy to get to a good spot to keep an eye on the kids. Valet and concierge was excellent proactive and eager to help with all rhe shopping and give advice for excursions.

The 0.5 point off is b/c at the breakfast, their fresh cut fruit, either melon or cantaloupe, went sour every morning, and their peach tasted blend. I can understand this, as most of the fruit was ""imported"". Their local pineapple tasted great!And that's all my complaints. Great location. In the middle of everything. Very short walk to the beach. Hotel gift shop, a large ABC store, and a food truck yard right down stairs. Royal Hawaiian Center and Aloha Landing , a tour bus pick up center, and the post office were within 3 minutes walk. Farmer's Market is held outside hotel on Thursday afternoon/evenings. Like I said, in the middle of everything.We stayed on 14th floor in Hula tower, facing Imperial Hotel. Although it is a City View room, you will see the ocean from the balcony. Separate climate control in the living room and the bedroom. Very quiet and spacious. If you happened to be awake at 6 am, you would hear the truck backing in, but it was not loud enough to wake you up. With the water sink in the kitchen I got to do dishes without interrupting my son's nap, and while have swimming suites soak in the facial sink in the bathroom at the same time. Unlike other Embassy Suites, there was a electric kettle in the kitchen! I liked it very much. If you do the on-line check-in, the map shown during the process is misleading. It shows as if the elevators were next to room **26, but they are actually located next to room **21 and **32. Don't pick those rooms. Every hotel asks you to save the Earth by reusing the towel, but this Embassy Suites had more than that. It has a simple robe hook next to the bath tub! That's all it takes! I reused my towel for the entire week. No, I don't use fresh towel very day at home, I put them in the washer every one or two weeks. But I got to hang them dry properly at home. Most hotels expect you to do the same at their property, but don't offer you the hooks! In fact, the more hooks you put in the bathroom, the less towel you will see on the floor. I like the effort ES made. Although I do hope there were places to hang the wet swimming suites, especially you know people will get in the ocean or the pool every single day. My son loved the salt water pool. There was a area just for babies. The water was only 1 and 1/2 feet. Anyone can sit up properly should be safe in there. The free breakfast was great other than the fruit, the evening snack was good. Bell and valet services were fast.

There are 3 elevators in the hula tower so you were never waiting very long for a ride. Their breakfast staff did an amazing job keeping the food well stocked and tables cleaned. Their selection of food was great and they tried to switch up their selection from day to day. Look for Aldrin. This guy makes working look fun.

Tons of kids in the pool which is not ideal for me to swim in but the kids always had someone to play with. The pool also has a soft bottom which does feel odd. It could use an update.About Waikiki:The best beach area we found was in front of Dukes. No rocks and had huge sandbar. Nice waves to body surf but also great for little kids too. It is like a wave pool. We had our 5 year old wear life jacket which have us piece of mind. You can rent rafts, body boards and umbrellas. There are plenty of places on the beach so take a look around for the best price. If your going to eat out anywhere do so early. By 8p it was over an hour wait anywhere we went.

Spa nice as well and staff regularly walk round to provide drinks and food. We were on top floor level 21 and enjoyed a wee view of sea/mountain, and handy as we could always get in the lift down! I did a tour to Shangri-La (Doris Dukes museum which I'd recommend as change from sun/sea) and when I asked for taxi they provide the hotel taxi- a stretch limo which was a bit of fun.The staff are very friendly and have just provided a CD of Hawaiian music as a goodbye gift.If I could request one thing it would be a few mugs, plates in the wee kitchen.

The Embassy Suites was one of the only 'hits' that came up, and I am really glad we ended up choosing it.One thing to realize is that food is very expensive in Hawaii, as so much (75%?) is imported from elsewhere. Thus having a complimentary breakfast for 5 daily is worth at least $75 on every room's price. We knew this and were glad we factored that into the decision.We were amazed by the friendliness and outgoing helpfulness of everyone on the staff. The manager at registration (Ray) was great and made us feel very welcome. The breakfast staff was also very friendly - even offering to get us drinks when they were 10 feet away from us. Resty stands out as one of these great staff.We also had a very nice extended conversation with a female manager on staff (Selema?) when we were just relaxing. All in all we found the staff extremely friendly.The location is nice - its a block away from the beach, and above the beachwalk, which is an urban strip-mall and entertainment space. Lots of things going on and tons of restaurant options nearby. Also a great nest of 5 ethnic food trucks that we went to twice.The only staff complaint we have is that it was very difficult to communicate and coordinate with our housekeeper on when she would be able to clean our room. We would leave at 7am or so each day, return around 1pm for our 4-year old to nap, and somehow she wouldnt try to clean our room until 1pm. After the second day, we started making a point of explicitly telling her when we were leaving and expecting to return in the hopes it could be done by then, but it wasn't helping. One day our room wasn't cleaned at all, and another we had to leave at 2pm while she cleaned. This is a relatively minor issue, but it was frustrating (likely just a communication issue - she was very nice).The other small suggestion we had was that there were only 2 hooks in the bathroom to hang towels and clothes for 5 people! This might be something to consider given that its a beach hotel (with a big pool).Overall, we had a great stay and would come back tomorrow if it were possible.

I'm just submitting this review a little later. Also see me review of Maui Coast Hotel with information of my stay on maui.The room (had a balcony), breakfast and the location was excellent. Our room looked over the main lanai and the pool. The room is clean. We went running every other morning. There were parks nearby to run to. I'm never psyched with a forced valet service ($30/day). But in this area, it's worth it if you rented a car. I couldn't imagine finding parking everyday and worrying about parking rules and meters.It was nice to have breakfast within the hotel. It's a hot breakfast (omlette station, eggs, waffle maker, pancakes, home fries, toast station, bagels) with cold breakfast options (fruit, yogurt, salad). There is an acai berry juice that is soooo good. Breakfast is great to say the least.The hotel is not on the beach but it's a short walk to the beach. Waikiki beach is rocky. It's ideal to get a car rental and drive to the north shore. It's also less hustle and bustle on the Noth shore.The pool was peaceful-not too many people and not too many kids.We went to Pearl Harbor and hiked at Olomana trail. Pearl Harbor is entirely free but you do have to go to the window to get a ticket for the boat ride to the Arizona Memorial. The ticket is free but you need the ticket to reserve a seat. Check the website for peak times and peak seasons where they run out of tickets. When you get on the boat, sit on the right side of the boat brcause you can get a nice photo as you're approaching the memorial. When you get off the boat, linger behind everyone because when everyone gets off, they all rush to the wall of names in the back of the memorial. You can get a nice picture of the wall of names when a boat is arriving to take people back. When you're leaving, sit at the back of the boat because you can get a nice photo of the memorial with the wake of the boat in the foreground. The hike at Olomana was difficult for me (I have short legs). I'm also not an experienced hiker. Just remember you have to decend wherever you ascend. The views were gorgeous and worth the effort.We rented a car and drove all around the island. Once you get away from the main Honolulu area, the views are beautiful. I'm not a big picture taker but everywhere you turn, you just have to take one because it's so breathtaking.","Jersey City, New Jersey","Caity52854</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jersey City, New Jersey</strong>",20,4.0

The hotel itself is good, the pool and gym facilities are adequate and the short walk to the beach is a plus. Our room (2101, One Bedroom Suite One King Bed City View) was a little small but very clean. Whilst I am a light sleeper, the room was right next to the lifts and I found the noise unsettling. Also, we found the air-conditioning to be highly unusual - sounded like there was a storm happening!Pro's:- Excellent staff (all extremely friendly and helpful).- Buffet breakfast included (make your own omelette, basic fruit and hot breakfast, cereal and drip coffee).- Swimming pool is great for little ones (not too deep), though very busy with the many families staying at the hotel.- Rooms are very clean and well stocked.- Gym is adequate (i.e. 3 treadmills, 2 bikes, elliptical, free weights, cable and pulley machine and other small weight machines).- On-site washing/drying machines (look at cons below).- No resort fees.- Good internet coverage.Cons:- Washing machines are only credit card operated. Can be costly as our fee per card transaction was $8.00. - Our room was very noisy (between the lift operation and air conditioning sounds, I had to buy ear plugs).- LOTS of families with young children. This makes the buffet breakfast and pool outings an ""adventure"".Overall, our experience with the hotel was good.

Am I am so pleased about that. My previous stay made me want to go back this time with my husband.This time we booked through the airline and our stay with the Aussie dollar was $500 AU per night actually about the same it was back in 2012. I did not book through the hotel itself as I said but next time as a Hilton Honor member I would see what the price was and check with hotel first.Our Jetstar arrive 6am and we knew very well check in time was 3pm. Because of hitch in another matter I sat in the foyer as I was completely spent till around midday. During that time others were being place in their rooms. In fairness we were given voucher for breakfast and lift to 4th floor only, a very nice move by the manager. I think we arrived in our room around 1pm on 21st floor. We looked over the street below front entrance. Quite and very nice. A few rooms up from lifts.Breakfast for us was I would say, catering for Asian and US patrons. As well travelled Europe travellers we do enjoy the healthier options more that are offered there. But saying that we did not go hungry. There were great self-serving drink stations, juice, water. Coffee, soft drink and water. And the staff a few face I recall form 2012 were still there offering to get your coffee saying hello to everyone and clearing continually. Don’t leave your food unattended as birds are frequently steal it. One in particular staff there was outstanding. 50/10Pancakes, sweet cakes, toast that you can make, omelettes that they make and varied food offered daily. Fruit was there also.Every second night music from band was absolutely fantastic, they got the joint rockin.. every single time. 100/10 for them. The Happy 2 hours nightly offered with an assortment of drinks and coffee and soft drink if you wanted was available 30/10. If you did not want the nibbles that are available, you could have ordered reasonably priced food too. I thought the food that was free was average. But hey the drinks made it all quite a good. Serving staff during the night were very nice both at the bar and the food. Drinks were strong and generous. 2 faces that there in 2012. Worth their weight in gold.Our room staff were so nice and very friendly.So if you are looking for fun entertainment each 2nd night, happy 2 hours big breakfasts, lovely pool area and friendly staff then this is your place to be.I would go again if I could get a better deal for sure.",Sydney,"Carol S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney</strong>",27,5.0

Our room was ready when we arrived from the airport around 2pm so no waiting. Everything went smoothly and we loved the punch that was presented during checkin. We had an Oceanview room 1908 in the Aloha tower (further from the beach) that had a great view of the pool area. While the view of the ocean was OK, we all preferred the pool view so we could see what was going on there. The room was a classic Embassy Suites room. 2 Queens in the bedroom and the living area with a kitchenette with microwave and mini fridge. Our room was clean and we had no issues with daily housekeeping.We were so tired from traveling the first day but could not pass up the managers reception. We truly enjoyed our complimentary cocktails everyday from 5:30-7:30p. The drinks were strong, sometimes too strong, but were easily fixed by adding a little more of the chaser. Also, don't be put off by the drink lines. They go really fast!Breakfast buffet was also really good. Made to order omelettes, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, pancakes, French toast, yogurt, fruit, beads, danishes, cereal and a bunch of stuff that I didn't eat. I believe they were Japanese options. All of it was delicious. We always found ourselves up at 6am so would always be waiting for breakfast to open at 6:30a. The time change really messed us up. Haha. But it helps to get our day started off right.We used the Expedia travel desk to book our Luau. Ended up at Chiefs and it was amazing from start to finish. Pickup was at Trump Resort next door with entrance on Saratoga. We splurged on the Royal package because I wanted to be in the front and didn't want my kids to have to look over too many heads. It was perfect!Little tips :--Check out the Long's drug store on the corner of Beachwalk and Kalakaua for all your needs. It's in the CVS family. --There's also an ABC store directly across the street on Lewers. --There's an entrance to the hotel right beside Yardbird on Lewers (found this out after two days). Don't miss the Lobster Garlic Noodles there. Yum. --Don't miss the Steak Shack. Cheap delicious eats just 3 minutes away right on the beach. --Cute little place called Beachwalk Cafe had the best macarons. It's two minutes away on Beachwalk and Kalia. --The beach is a two minute walk away but we much preferred the beach in front of the Outrigger Beach Resort (not Outrigger Reef Resort). The vendor there rented beach chairs and umbrellas which was important to us. It was about $10 per hour for the 2-chair and umbrella set. And we didn't have to worry about the rocks. --You can easily catch the bus (routes 42 or 20) to Pearl Harbor with no transferring. Ride is about one hour. It's $2.50 one way per adult and $1.25 per child over 6 (exact change). Sure beats the high cost of tours and you can go and leave when you want. Just one tip. If you MUST go to the USS Arizona memorial, you need to reserve tickets online in advance for about $1 per ticket. Otherwise the ticket is free on site but there may be a wait. For example, we arrived around 11a but the tour to the memorial wasnt available until 2pm. There is a lot to see without the memorial and we found that with my kids, the museum was enough. We stayed about 2 hours. We would have stayed another 2-3 hours to ferry over to the memorial and back.Last but not least, our flight home on the last day was not until 7:30pm. After we checked out, we were able to store our luggage with the bell desk. After that we had a pool day until around 3. Then asked for the hospitality suite to freshen up. This one last thing really made the Embassy Suites stand out to us. We are able to shower, repack our things and get ready to head out for our flight. It really made a world of difference for our family. Great service overall!","Houston, Texas","tanishaoh</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Houston, Texas</strong>",24,5.0

Everyone went above and beyond if we had a request, even called the bus company to check on routes and times for our return trip from surfing because of the memorial day parade. Lleuellyn had a bright smile every morning when we headed for breakfast and a cheery ""how are you, what are you doing today?"" followed by a short conversation.

It has two tall buildings with pool and restaurant (for morning breakfast buffet and afternoon happy hour) in between two buildings on the fourth floor. There are many restaurants, shops, convenience stores, and one drug store within walking distance.  Our family of four stayed there for 4 nights last month. We had a pleasant time. However, we felt we did not get good advice from the concierge service. I talked to the staff at the concierge desk a couple of time. I told her we were going to drive to North Shore one day and she recommended Polynesian Cultural Center. I followed her advice and bought 4 tickets at $453 total for luau and show (Breath of Life) on a weekday night. She said very specifically that the earliest check-in time was 4pm as luau seating would start at 4:30pm. The time was also printed clearly on the receipt. When asked if the park entrance was included, she said NO. We thought the price was high but accepted it as we did not know any better. After tasting the garlic shrimp (from the famous shrimp truck) and shaved ice in Haleiwa, we drove around North Shore aimlessly because we did not want to arrive too early. Once we got there at 4pm, we were told that park entrance was included in the tickets we bought. In other words, we could have seen shows and taken canoe rides in various parts of the Cultural Center if we had arrived earlier. I was very upset when I heard what we had missed. The customer service person regretted that he could not give us any credit but we could go back within the next three days which was no help because we were leaving the next day.  After expressing our displeasure to Embassy Suites, the assistant general manager responded as follows: I’ve forwarded your comments to Expedia as it appears that you were given some misinformation. Their area manager will recommunicate with his staff about providing the correct information to all Expedia agents about all tours, especially the popular ones like Pearl Harbor and Polynesian Cultural Center. We felt that the staff wearing Embassy Suites uniform sitting behind Embassy Suites counter represents Embassy Suites not Expedia.

We had honeymooned in Waikiki in 1975 at the Outrigger Reef and have returned to Oahu numerous times. This was our third stay at Embassy Suites and it could not have been more perfect.Months ago we requested one of the corner rooms in the Aloha Tower on the 21st floor. Kay Lee, Revenue Coordinator at the hotel told me she would do her best to satisfy our request – and she came through! Our suite was at the northwest corner of the building with a wrap around balcony. The views were amazing! We could see the ocean from our couch in the living room and downtown Honolulu. What a treat! The suite had a dining room with table and chairs, living room with enormous flat screen TV, a spacious bedroom with a king bed and a roomy bathroom. We couldn’t have been happier!Since our last stay, the furniture has been replaced with a new comfortable couch, chairs and Hawaiian art on the wall. Tasteful, warm colors were used for everything.The nightly managers’ reception was fun with live music on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. The house band really rocks and people were blissfully dancing to the tunes.We used the pool several times and found it quite pleasant and not crowded with ample beach lounges.Our housekeepers couldn’t have been more professional, polite and thorough. Leave them a tip – they deserve it! The location of the hotel is outstanding and it’s a quick walk to the beach. Hanging out at the beachfront of Fort DeRussy park is my personal favorite.Now that I’m back home, I’ve got the post-Waikiki vacation blues.

The location is very central to Waikiki - there are several top restaurants nearby as well as food truck. We literally could go downstairs to Henry's place to buy sliced papaya or mango and come right back upstairs to eat. The breakfast was included and bountiful - egg station, miso soup, salad, fruit, and many more. Valet is $35 and there is no self parking.

We were provided with a suite on the southeast corner of the hotel on the 11th floor, so we had balconies on both the south and east side of the room. Now the ESH Waikiki Beach Walk is not directly on the beach, but back about a block - however our south-facing balcony had a nice view of the ocean, though flanked by the Halekulani and Outrigger Reef hotels on either side.If you like to shop - particularly in high-end stores, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better location than the ESH Waikiki Beach Walk. You are literally in the middle of a newly-renovated shopping district with Beverly-Hills-esque shops and galleries in every direction. Chanel, Gucci, Tiffany's, and many more, all within a block - and of course, a Starbuck's on just about every corner. Lots of well-reviewed restaurants within minutes as well, though, to be honest, the best meal we had during our 7-day stay was at the Denny's just across the street!Our room was open and airy, comfortably appointed in a tropical style, and included a little kitchenette containing a mini-fridge, microwave and sink. The fridge didn't have a freezer section in it, so stocking up on Haagen-Dazs ice-cream bars for a late-night snack was not an option (I think that was the only negative criticism I could come up with!). The beds were firm but comfortable, and everything was scrupulously clean and in good repair. And the SHOWER - let me expound a bit on hotel showers...Most hotels - even the really nice expensive ones - use these ""water miser"" shower heads, where you have to stand under them for a five full minutes before you can even properly call yourself wet. I think that if you're spending hundreds of dollars every night to stay at a four-star hotel, management should spring FOR MORE THAN A NICKEL'S WORTH OF WATER!!! (You can tell that I feel strongly about this.) Okay, that said, the Embassy Suites by Hilton Waikiki Beach Walk hotel's shower, at least in my room, was quite possibly the best hotel shower I've ever experienced. I'm talking awesome-water-pressure, full-on, high-volume 'water-waster', get-wet-in-five-seconds, best-ever shower! And even though we were on the 11th floor, the water was hot in under 15 seconds. Now, the ESH Waikiki Beach Walk is not a new hotel, but it IS well-run, well-maintained, and all other aspects of our stay were just as pleasant as were our showers.From concierge to housekeeping, the entire hotel staff was extremely attentive, efficient and friendly, and we had the feeling that they were actually happy to be working there. Just good energy all around. Next time we stay in Waikiki, this hotel is where you'll find us!","Waikiki, Hawaii","dpeters30</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Waikiki, Hawaii</strong>",4,5.0

This hotel is great, especially the location it is in the centre of everything. No you are not directly on the beach but just in a minute walk your on the beach, just across the street! There is ABC store on every corner, there is two next to the hotel it just takes 30 sec to walk to both. Also there is two Starbucks in a 30 sec walk, for all the coffee lovers. All the activity was right next the hotel, you walk a couple of minutes and you in the heart of the shopping area. For the Aloa Moana mall and the Outlets you will have to get a taxi but its a short ride(we never went there). The staff were great, especially the concierge(the Expedia expert) who helped us book The Pearl Harbour Tour (highly recommend). It was around 40 mins from the airport, when we arrived we got a taxi from the airport which cost $50 (bags and tip included), on the way back from the hotel to the airport we ordered a Limo (recommend, so much better) it was $60 which included our bags and plus tip which was $70. The buffet breakfast was delicious, every morning I had a fresh omelet with fresh fruit, especially pineapple so good! The only negative comment I would have to make about the breakfast was the coffee was not good (personal opinion, so I went to Starbucks to get it :)). Also, just a heads up, in the morning getting breakfast, seeing how its beautiful everyday you get to enjoy breakfast outside, there are a few birds flying around, the staff do their best to shoo them away but your outdoors with food! The rooms are beautiful, we stayed in room 2106, the top floor with an amazing view of Diamond head, the beach, a partial view of the ocean, and the city with a nice size patio and the sun hits it in the morning. Just use caution when out on the balcony with kids, to me the railing is on the low side for being so high up. The room had two comfy queen beds and in the sitting area a pull out sofa (which we didn't use). The bathroom was nice and big. Also there was a wet bar with a mini fridge(we bought water, some fruit, and sandwich meat). The pool area was amazing the sun is on it the whole day, and just a tip when we were there was not that many people there so it was nice to get a break from the busy beach area for a day. In the evening time the recepetion time had the bar opened (which the bartender was great, knew how to mix drinks which is always a plus) plus it had a few snack to munch on and on certain days they had a live band playing music from different eras (they were very good, they also played todays music but with their own twist, which I loved). Overall I would definitely come back to this hotel and highly recommend this to anyone going.

Fruit punch upon check in very nice. Kona coffee would be nice in rooms since this is a trademark of Hawaiian Coffee. The resort has more asian guests then previous years but therefore a more subdued and quiet atmosphere. The managers reception every evening 5-7 with free alcohol and non/alcohol drinks fantastic. Pool side service has slipped a bit so you need to go to the pakini bar to order. Food very good! The Pool is small but adequate. Sun does not hit the pool till around 11:30am. Go to the beach for the am then hit the pool and order food for lunch. Always chases available. Staff has been there forever saying it is a great place to work and they love their jobs. Dennis is awesome. Only annoying thing is the alarm sound across the street from the trump hotel when vehicles exit the parkade. This goes on till around 2am.

This trip our timeshare was undergoing maintenance work which put us off and we decided to try our luck again at the Embassy Suites. All in all this stay was so impressive that we have decided that we're done with the timeshare and the Embassy Suites will be our regular hotel for future stays. Upon check in we were allocated our partial ocean view room on a very high floor with a small view of Diamond Head and a distant slice of Waikiki Beach. We spoke to reception and asked if there might be a room with a view of 'closer' beach and were promptly directed to a lovely corner room on the 11th floor with beautiful views across the Outrigger reef with the beach beyond...very happy. Our first morning in paradise, we wandered down to breakfast expecting a frantic free for all (it is of course included in the room charge) and were pleasantly surprised by minimal crowds, plenty of tables and a great selection of food choices to keep all 5 or us happy. After a long day at the beach, the complementary Managers reception with drinks, nibbles and a live band (?!!!) was a beautiful and fun way to end the day, meet some new friends whilst the kids frolicked in the pool and head out to dinner relaxed (thanks to the complementary mai tais!).

What started as a nightmare stay from booking the reservation at the get go, turned out to be very accommodating thanks to the front desk manager Garret O. Who helped us to acquire the 2-bedroom with roll in shower as we had requested. The breakfast buffet is always a delight, and since grandma was in a rented wheelchair, it was easy for us to enjoy having breakfast with her. I suggest eating at 6:30am as the buffet is open then, it is not busy, and the staff are nice (probably because it's not crowded). There's a business center, but only in one tower, so if you are in the second tower you may have a little walk but it's easy to get to. On Mondays, Wednesday, Friday's, and Saturdays there is live music during the managers reception (complementary non-alcoholic/alcoholic drinks and snacks). It's fun, you could have a quick show for 2 hours and just relax with some drinks from draft, blue hawaii's, white, and wells liquor. The bartenders are very nice and courteous - I tipped a $1 per drink - but it's not necessary...as I'm sure the price for the complementary drinks are factored into your bill. The cleaning staff are really nice, and very helpful if you need more towels, pillows, or toiletries. The room gets pretty cold if you have it on high, so be prepared to stay cool and enjoy it after being outside at the beach or walking around waikiki. This hotel is close to many stores, main malls, and eateries. If you want to dine in, I suggest Ruth's Chris steakhouse - it's connected to the hotel, just have to take the elevator from the pool deck down one floor or you can take the escalator - very convenient. Also, there's yard house - good beer, good burgers, good fish and chips (make sure it's not too oily before you bite into it- that sucker burns).

Internet speed is enough to do some basic surfing but certain times of days (evenings) it does slow significantly.I opted for room service on my first day after a long trip, my lunch (burger and fries) was nice and very fulfilling for one person however my evening meal was a let down (Mahi fish with rice), everything was very bland and boring which was a surprise to me in Hawaiian.

The shower head sprayed all over but everything else seemed to work. Small frig and microwave provided. The breakfast was well run and offered a fair number of choices and the hot dishes rotated every other day. The staff in the hospitality area was excellent: the omelette lines were run better than any Embassy Suites I have visited and there were helpful attendants to clear tables and even offered refills on juice and coffee! The same area is used for a lovely happy hour each day--it has an open covered area next to the pool and also seating inside. HH features basic bar snacks but a large variety of drinks. The bartenders are really great. 3 days a week there is live music during happy hour. It was an impressive perk of staying at this hotel. The hotel is not on the beach, but only a block away from a beach access path. While not my favorite part of Waikiki beach, it's only 5 minutes by foot to the ocean. The main reason that I gave only 4 stars is that the lobby area is lacking any feeling of cohesion. The two towers are connected by long corridors and a walk through the entrance to the parking lot/valet area and a rather unimpressive lobby. When compared with the nearby Sheraton, Outrigger or Moana, the lobby and public areas of the Embassy Suites don't measure up. For me, it didn't matter at all. The pool and hospitality areas made up for the lack of a nice lobby but I've been to Waikiki many times. Also, in a fairly tough area to drive around in, the Embassy Suites is easy to navigate. Valet parking is efficient, though expensive, and there is room to unload luggage and passengers. Also, there are many shops and restaurants in the same block as the hotel, including a deluxe ABC just across Lewers which seemed to be open all hours.

Evening snacks are just a few veggies and chips plus drinks but nice nevertheless. Valet service was very efficient but a bit pricey at $35. per day. Don't get a room by the elevator. We had to request a fan to be run at night to drown out the dinging of the elevator. Business center was great. We were able to check in for our flight home and print our boarding passes. Aldrin at the breakfast service was wonderful and much deserving of an extra tip. Housekeeping was less than optimal as we had to request clean glasses, cups, tea, sugar every day.

It did get hectic at times but it was always well-managed. There were two chefs preparing eggs-to-order and there were two buffet lines for other hot items (i.e., scrambled eggs, meats, potatoes, etc.). In the dining area itself, there was a large station for beverages (coffee/tea and soft drinks) and there was a cold buffet in a separate area which had cereals. The chefs did a great job and we enjoyed great omelets each morning. From 5:30P – 7:30P there was a manager’s reception. On several nights there was live music. In addition to complimentary cocktails, beer and wine, there were appetizers which changed nightly. They included veggies & dip, chips & salsa, peanuts, potato chips, etc. The appetizers were replenished throughout the evening. All staff at the property were warm & friendly.

My wife & 2 kids (16 & 12) & I found this 2 room suite to be perfect amount of space & very clean & comfortable which is most important to us! We had a fabulous ocean view in 1831 Hula tower on the 18th floor to enjoy incredible sunsets & all the warm Hawaii nights!! The hotel is in a perfect location on beach walk with tonnes of restaurants, shopping nightlife & a super fast < 5 min walk to beach! Great place if you do t have a vehicle. The room was always kept very clean & spacious enough that we weren't't tripping over each other in the minimal time spent in the room. The only 2 things that keeps this from a 5 star rating in my view is that the pool area was swarmed by very young kids from early morning until at least 9-9:30 at night everyday which even my 12 & 16 year old found annoying & exhausting. It was very loud & I can only imagine how hard the chlorine had to work!! But it is a family hotel so if you are looking for a quiet space I suggest the Trump or Halekulani but those will be in a different price category as well. The other disappointing part of the stay was the managers reception every night at the pool area from 5:30-7. We were looking forward to having a nice place to relax at the end of the day, have a couple free drinks & some nice appetizers before going out for a later dinner. When we checked it out on the first evening we were disappointed at the quality of the drinks & especially the appetizers....nothing more than some tortilla chips with melted cheese & some broccoli florets, ranch dressing & goldfish crackers......really!! And it was basically the same every night, a little more upscale & some variety would have been nice. Even though it was free, it wasn't worth it to us.Overall, a great family hotel in a perfect location on Waikiki with some potentially terrific views. If you are looking for good quality at a reasonable price (for Hawaii LOL) this is your spot. If you want a little more quiet or upscale, it will be too loud & hectic with families!

Our last week in Embassy Suites has convinced us that it is difficult for the other hotels to match the price value of ES in terms of location (we prefer Beachwalk area to central Kalakaua because it is quieter, cleaner, and close to our preferred less congested beach area around Hilton, Fort DeRussy area). ES is surrounded by its own area of shops and restaurants right outside its door. The room size and cleanliness and up to date decor of ES was right on with a living room area with a pull out sofa, dining area and microwave/sink/and mini fridge and two full size TVs. Nice size pool and lounging area and a small fitness center. In terms of service, top drawer from Garrick taking our request for early check in and higher floor room assignment, to Ray with his wonderful Jamaican accent who greeted us royally when we checked in. Great first impression. Housekeeping was great and did I mention the room rate includes full breakfast in addition to a daily cocktail reception with wine/beer/ and specialty drinks with local live entertainment. Traffic entering and exiting hotel is efficient although there is a daily parking fee. Example of excellent service is Lacy, catering manager who graciously allowed us to see the last minutes of the San Antonio Spurs game at the cocktail area. Note their General Manager personally responds to all social media reviews. This general manager's attentiveness to service and details is reflective on the management of this specific ES hotel. The Tom family no longer needs to check out hotels for Honolulu vacations.

I had stayed at the Hilton Waikiki beach several times before, but likely never again. Our stay at the Embassy Suites was simply amazing. I had some interactions with the Hotel manager, Malia Espinda, and she was incredible. Very polite and attentive and everything I would want if I were hiring a manager. She was everything a Guest services manager should be and more. We also had a couple of instances to talk to Dean at the bell desk and he went out of his way to help us and set up transportation as needed. When we checked into the hotel, the wrong tower, but correct room number was written on our check in ticket. Dean noticed it and insisted on going up with us to make 100% sure we were in the right place. He actually said, ""i don't want you to have to come down get another key if its wrong so I'll make sure. If a different key is needed I'll let you into the room and personally go get two new keys for you"". Who does that anymore? Service from top to bottom at this hotel was no less than some of the best we have ever had.Family friendly for sure, but very quiet overall. The only noise we noted was kids having a blast at the busy area around the pool as they should. There were quieter parts of the pool area is you wanted them, but we had fun watching the crazy kids. The food and happy hour (or two hours) at the pool every day was great. We met many people and had a great time mingling. The full breakfast buffet was also amazing with cooked to order eggs or omelets. 100% a very good breakfast with no room for complaints. Breakfast is also served from 6:30-10:30 which is great. Many hotel limit these hours, i'm assuming in an attempt to limit the number of breakfasts served. The Location is truly the best part. Very central to Waikiki, the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center and the beach. Its really about the best of all worlds when you are looking for vacation. We looked out our balcony at the Prada store and all the shopping up and down the area. Extremely central. The Royal Hawaiian Village is also a very nice hotel, but just a bit far from everything. This hotel gets a 10 for location without question.The rooms are very clean and very nice. Not extravagant, but very nice and very quiet. Linens are top notch and the mattresses are very comfortable. Tons of pillows as well! Great selection of TV channels for everyone and incredible views of Diamond head from the one side of the hotel. The only thing we really didn't like was leaving! Not a complaint anywhere and we thank the whole staff that offered any help as either of us needed. I can assure you that we will be back.","Longmont, Colorado","jmoar</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Longmont, Colorado</strong>",35,5.0

I have been trying since yesterday to get some chairs reserved on Waikiki, to no avail. The Royal Hawaiian has some public chairs and umbrellas available to rent, but they sell out quickly. I wish I had known this. So, if you are coming here and want to spend the day on the beach, in a chair and not on a towel, reserve your chairs early. Also, the pool here is small, but it looks like all the hotels have small pools from what I have noticed. All in all, this is a great place.

The main reason is that it provides suites and free breakfast. But, the so called suites are kind of small and not very comfortable. The breakfast, other than omelets, is rather poor and selection of food is really unsatisfactory. Did they see the selection at Hilton Frankfurt for example. Orange juice does not taste like real orange juice and there is only one kind of milk. I had to get eggs in addition to the omelet since I did not know what else to eat. Overall the hotel seems much better in photos and on paper than in reality. In order to get to the beach you have to walk quite a bit through a narrow alley between other buildings and, at least in the afternoon, this is the smallest beach I've ever seen. The pool is not big enough for such a big hotel. It's overcrowded during the managers reception where you have to wait in line to get a lot of ice and a bit of orange juice in your glass. There are some carrots and other snacks...it seems like they spent a minimal amount of money. Small fridges, no utensils in room. The location is nice but it's much better to stay at hotels right across the beach like Hyatt Regency which are also cheaper and closer to everything. The Beach Walk stores and restaurants seem overpriced. For example the Cheesecake Factory has the same prices as Chesee Burger on Beach Walk, but Cheesecake Factory is so much more superior in every way. Perhaps this would not be so bad if Embassy Suites was not charging more than others because of things like breakfast but then they warn you to better come at 6:30 hour... or later you may have to wait in long lines. The view from the room is onto several concrete buildings. It does have flat screen TV but the kind that's outdated at this point. No smart TVs.The Internet works but it's not strong enough for streaming TV for example.","Chicago, Illinois","worldtraveller872</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",19,3.0

The suites are very nice and clean although the furnishings are a little dated. The bed was good. The view fron the room was good. The free breakfast is the best free breakfast I have ever had. The short order cooks making omelets are the best. It's amazing to watch them while they cook your omelet. The staff in the breakfast area couldn't be more accommodating. The breakfast area is outdoors adjacent to the pool deck. This was my second stay at this hotel, and there isn't any place that I'd rather have breakfast. The hotel is probably over priced, but so is everything else in Hawaii. I highly recommend this hotel.

This is my fourth stay at this hotel and each stay seems to get better than the previous stays. The buffet breakfast is an amenity that is not included in the rate at most other Waikiki hotels and the food and service are excellent. The breakfast service staff are all very friendly but one in particular, named Aldrin, has always greeted us personally and goes out of his way to see if there is anything we need. The evening reception with snacks, free drinks and entertainment four nights a week is also very nice. The local band which plays at the reception is very good and is one of the reasons we continue to stay here when we go to Honolulu. The bell staff are also very friendly and courteous. One in particular, named Dean, has always been very helpful to us and always says to us, ""let me know if there is anything you need"". During this stay, Ray Rodney who is a customer service manager greeted us personally at almost every evening reception with an offer to let him know if there is anything we needed to make our stay more comfortable. During this latest visit, Mr. Rodney and one of the servers (Christina) delivered a complimentary large fruit, cheese and crackers tray to our room, which came totally unexpected to us. The tray was excellent. Our housekeeper, Josie, was very friendly and helpful our entire stay. Also, the check-in process went very smoothly and when I asked if there were any complimentary upgrades available we were put into an ocean view room. We couldn't have been more pleased with the room and I only wish I would have gone back to get the name of the lady who checked us in. In summary, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, as always, and can't wait until we can return here again.","Marietta, Georgia","jeromesadler</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Marietta, Georgia</strong>",2,5.0

In fact, we were able to have the rooms across from each other. We received a lovely welcome at Reception where we were greeted with a smile and a cold glass of juice. Since my last visit, the hotel has undergone a “refresh” with new carpeting, curtains, lounges and bedding. The linens were beautiful and bedding was very comfortable. Housekeeping staff were very friendly and interested in our daily activities. They were very prompt with servicing our rooms each day. A daily buffet breakfast and nightly cocktail reception are provided to all guests at the Embassy Suites. Breakfast provided a range of choices for everyone – you could choose from a fully cooked breakfast or continental options each day. The cocktail reception provided a choice of beverages, snacks and entertainment – a relaxing way to end the day. Breakfast and cocktails are located on the 4th floor Lanai near the pool – a lovely partly open space. The hotel only offers Valet Parking, no Self-Parking – it seemed quite expensive at $35 per day but it proved to be a great service. Our car was retrieved very quickly each day and the Valets were very courteous. The Embassy is not located on the beachfront but is only a short walk away – however, is located is a great part of Waikiki with all the amenities close by.

The room was great, very clean and spacious. We had a ocean view corner room (SE side of hotel, Aloha tower which is closer to the beach side) so had two lanais. We were on a lower floor (< 10) so the smell of the grills from the restaurant below (Roy's) could be a little overwhelming if the lanai doors were open - not a problem if closed. The two queen beds were comfortable but on the soft side. The sofa bed was actually very comfortable since it had a memory foam-type mattress vs. those old spring mattresses.The free breakfast was a good bonus but got less appealing after the 2nd day as the selection was mediocre and the pastries were horrible. The best part were the omelette and cereal stations. We're not much into to drinking alcohol but the evening reception seemed popular.The location was both good and bad. The good - close to shopping and restaurants and a 5 minute walk to the beach. The bad - it is surrounded on all sides by other hotels so street noise at night is a problem. Starting at about 3am, you can hear semi-trucks, delivery trucks, trash trucks, etc. backing into to bays in the various hotels and they make that loud beeping noise as they reverse in. This happened just about every night except maybe Sunday. If you wear ear plugs, you should be OK. If it wasn't for the noise, I would give this hotel a solid 4 instead of the 3.","Plano, Texas","John K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Plano, Texas</strong>",8,3.0

The rooms were really nice and clean; daily housekeeping was great too. The breakfasts were amazing! Lots of food, plenty of variety with slight changes each day; also an egg chef was available who cooked the most amazing omelettes or you could order fried, poached or boiled if you preferred. You most definitely would not be leaving this breakfast hungry! Everyday, from 5:30 to 7:30pm, was 'Happy Hour' with free drinks like. Blue Hawaii, Mai Tai, wine and beer and snacks. There was no limit on the drinks and the snacks could certainly fill you e.g. nachos, crisp veges with dips like broccoli and carrot; edamame beans; nuts and other snack mixes. The swimming pool was a great size and had a large spa pool attached; there were plenty of poolside chairs, tables, loungers and canopy day beds. If you're lucky you will get a room with a view out to sea; however, the surrounding views are also pleasant. We did ask for a room change (which was no trouble to them at all) and that was because our first room was right beside the lift i.e. the lift walls were in our bedroom so we could hear it going up and down all night; that would be our only recommendation: ensure you're not beside it! Also, the word apartment (which was used to describe our accommodation at booking) in this case means your room does not come with crockery, cutlery, glasses or tea towels etc. You can request them if needed. The room has a microwave and kettle/jug, tea, coffee etc but no other cooking facilities. Overall, a great place, located in a really handy position with relaxed staff who make you feel at home.

I’ve only recently been reminded that I did not post this (second) review, so it my now be “out-of date”, but still relevant. If I was aware of this prior to posting my first review of this venue, I would have included it in my first review of 24th July 2015.My review on that date applies in all respects to this visit as well.HOWEVER:Firstly, our advice is ENSURE THERE ARE NO USA SCHOOL HOLIDAYS during the period you wish to stay. The local Hawaii paper publishes weekly snapshots of how many visitors the State receives. I think (from memory) the average is 70,000. 50,000 come from mainland USA and 20,000 from other countries. So accommodation venues are pretty well booked out over holiday periods (which is also reflected in their room rates).Also,VERIFY CHECK-IN TIMES. If, like us, you have arrived at your accommodation after a long, sleep-disrupted overnight flight you may find that you have to wait several hours for a room to become available, even longer if you are in a group and want suites close to each other. Reception staff do the best they can, but it’s just the timing – they are waiting for other guests to book out so rooms can be prepared for the next “wave”. They are happy to hold your luggage. BEWARE of rooms ADJACENT TO LIFTS– we had room 1901 in Aloha Towers for over a week and were awoken every night by the noise of the lifts. Perhaps Management might consider staying in this room for a few nights when the premises are “fully loaded” to assess the problem? SAFETY ISSUE – in support of other reviews already posted by others - Management appears to have no reasonable procedure or communications in place to deal with evacuation in case of emergency e.g. fire alarm. To hear a loudspeaker blast out in the early hours of the morning and having to cope with stairs for 15 floors without sighting or receiving instructions or assistance from anyone in authority was not a good experience. A printed apology delivered to rooms did not mention the cause of the event. That was left to word of mouth and a statement by the General Manager in response to another review days later.

I do try to stick to the Hilton brand and would hope they (Hilton) would just be glad I am staying at their chain and recognize my loyalty even if I booked through someone else.","Austin, Texas","lashcroft</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",45,5.0

It is close to shopping, restaurants and the beach. As Hilton Hhonors members, we were able to select our room a day ahead of arrival. We were in room 2002 for 4 nights. It is a 1 BR King, 2 BA. It was a roomy corner suite, with a city view, but had some water view as well. It was quiet, but we did hear the garbage trucks early one morning, in spite of our windows being closed. This suite does not have a balcony, which we did not miss at all. The suite was very clean and housekeeping service was great. The buffet breakfast was very good and we enjoyed attending the reception in the evening where there were snacks including veggies, dips, chips, etc. I did have difficulty connecting to the Wi-Fi, even with a relatively new device. The staff was friendly and helpful. We would love to stay here again.","Victoria, Canada","Jean P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Canada</strong>",8,4.0

Though we had stayed @ the Waikiki Beach Marriott numerous times, we found our room @ this hotel quieter (with the lanai door closed, of course) than at the Marriott even though we were only on the 17th floor @ the ES vs. the 30th floor or higher @ the Marriott. Just not as much street noise @ the ES. We had a 2BR/2BA in the Aloha tower, which is the tower furthest from the beach, but looked out onto Diamond Head & a slice of the ocean if one leaned far enough out. The breakfast buffet is not the usual ES buffet, likely due to the high number of Japanese tourists who stay, but that is fine-made for a very nice change of pace. Beach/pool towels provided in the room along w/the usual ES room amenities including fridge & microwave. Unfortunately also the same annoying Hilton internet that has to be renewed every 24 hrs on the nose-this is one area where Marriott wins hands down! Did spend one afternoon @ the pool, which is on the 4th floor & shaded, somewhat, by the taller towers around it. Very short, not even 5 minute walk to the beach for anyone who wants full sun instead. Like most of Waikiki, plenty of shops & restaurants w/in an easy walk.","Phoenix, Arizona","txrus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, Arizona</strong>",118,4.0

The rooms are great - it's nice to have a separate bedroom. Very clean and they did have a free breakfast (eggs cooked to order) and an afternoon happy hour. We did have a few minor issues. Valet Parking is $35.00 per day and twice they brought me the wrong car. I could have easily driven away with someone else's car. They need to check closer. My biggest complaint was that you need to swipe your room key in the elevator. More than once I had my hands full and could not select my floor because my room key was in my pocket. This is an easy fix - the reader needs to be a proximity reader. It should be able to read my key from my pocket and let me select my floor.

We stayed there in February. For 7 nights. From the first night all we heard from 10pm to 2am was sounds from upstairs. From balcony furniture being moved to stomping etc. We figured it was a fluke. Same thing the next night. We called and spoke with MYLES. The WORST ""manager"" ever. Without getting into details, Myles must be fired or reduced to cleaning service. After calling him several times and being insulted, they finally sent security to our room. Security admitted that the room over us had kids in it and the parents told the security guard that HE had to speak to their kids!! WOW!Finally we were able to sleep. The next day I spoke with RAY the day manager. Now Ray was AMAZING! He offered us another room I did not want that. But he insisted. The other room ended up having the same sounds from upstairs on our final two nights. I believe after traveling and staying in 5 start to 2 star hotels that this one has building issues. Overall the staff are decent and the hotel is clean...but not a place to sleep or rest.

Check in was a breeze, they gave us a nice refreshing juice drink and also a box of chocolates since it was our anniversary. The buffet is quite good considering it's mass production. A nice variety too. Evening drink is nice--the pupus could be a little better. Pool and hot tub are wonderful! Never was crowded. All of the workers were super friendly and helpful. Room was super spacious and lots of storage. Everything was in good shape and not worn at all. This is the PERFECT location too. Super close walk to beach. Cheeseburger Beachwalk was good. The Denny's across the street is NOT. Subway is super handy for a light meal. We also enjoyed the steak house over at the Outrigger--you grill your own meat and it's like a $20 meal. includes a huge salad bar that also has rice and vegetables. Probably the best value for a really great steak! Embassy Suites has done a beautiful job. We loved our view of Diamond Head from Room 1806--really stunning.
