From the moment I arrived to the time I departed, the entire staff provided a seamless experience that left me impressed over and over again. The hotel’s butler, Wesley, was more thoughtful than I could have imagined, arranging an incredible in-room breakfast that delivered on even the smallest of my preferences. Then there are the rooms – expansive suites that cover an entire floor complete with a roomy private balcony and outdoor Jacuzzi. I woke up to the most incredible view of Waikiki Beach. It’s amazing how you can feel so relaxed and at peace while situated in the middle an incredible, cosmopolitan city. Don’t miss the rooftop infinity pool (there is a spa on the same level) and onsite dining at Mugen – all very worthy of a visit. , I’ve never been to a hotel with more thoughtful, personalized service and amenities. Considering there are only 9 rooms, I feel very lucky to have secured a reservation and can’t wait to come back.",,megandG2842GF,0,5.0

The rooms are amazing...from the ocean view to the detail of the pillows, everything is exquisite. The ohana at the espacio is above and beyond.

Really odd set up. Basic apartment building entrance. Lots of people downstairs but nobody could show lobby. Then lobby not open. Pretty sure all the positive reviews are PR bluff. Definitely not high end service so flagged and back to Halekulani, which is ok but not amazing rooms. Note Espacio also has one of those Israeli? moisturiser brand salesmen hawking outside. All together seems a bit low rent. ","Auckland Central, New Zealand","James_Kellow</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",57,3.0

From the moment we arrived it was nothing but exceptional. The valet and bell staff greeted us at the front and just whisked is away only to only give us a glass of much needed champagne. From there is was basically sitting down relaxing while they got our key cards ready and within minutes showed us to our own private floor. Walked in to just the most beautiful array of design and furniture. From that point we were in heaven. Jumped into our private hot tub on our lanai and just melted! The 4 days went by without a hiccup. Top notch chefs made us a Thanksgiving dinner and served it to our room. Almost can’t have Thanksgiving dinner anywhere else now, ruined in a great way. Lol Rooftop heated pool was the cream on the top. 260 degree view of Waikiki with a infinity edge to make you feel like your in the ocean. We barbecued with a awesome outdoor kitchen . If you haven’t seen the views in the room then you must definitely do it now. All bathrooms are to die for. Beautiful full kitchen to do any kind of cooking that would probably be sub par to the Mugen chefs (Espacio’s restaurant downstairs). Lol. Anyways I had a wonderful time there and highly highly recommend this hotel. You will not regret. P.S. If your thirsty and need a drink but not sure what to drink, ask for Lee, he killed it on the recommendation of any type of cocktail or wine. Most Happy Guest,Grant Y.",,37granty,0,5.0

So when planning a vacation with a group of 7 adults (3 couples and a single), we were looking for accommodations that would allow us to have separate rooms, each with their own bathroom, and a common space where we could gather and hang out as a group. The issue was always privacy. The hotels with suites have big lobbies you need to navigate and packed elevators. Luckily I received an email from the Aqua-Aston Group advertising, Espacio The Jewel of Waikiki, and very timely as I was there at the time & was given a tour of the property by none other than the GM! Espacio is brand new, all-suites, ultra luxe & exclusive hotel (opened Sept 15, 2019) on Waikiki’s main strip (Kalakaua Ave) with the beach directly across. Shops, restaurants, cafe’s abound as you leave the hotel doors. Location could not be better. The suite includes an Audi, Mercedes or other high end vehicle that sits five. Suites:Nine floors each floor named after a jewel & opening into a private suite as you exit the elevator doors. They have 2.5 or 3 bedroom suites and all suites have 3 ensuite bathrooms plus a powder room. Note that all suites are the exact same size & layout & decorated beautifully. The details are bar none. They are meticulously designed with Moroccan touches and italian marble throughout. As you walk into the suite you immediately see the end to end balcony (the expanse of each unit) through the floor to ceiling glass sliding doors with your private outdoor hot tub, seating furniture on the balcony & Waikiki Beach beckoning you! There is a large living, dining, kitchen area with an open concept that is decorated in a crisp, light (white,beige, taupe) modern/contemporary design. In the living room there is a big screen TV with a large couch and chaise as well as a full size writing table. The dining room has a large glass/ marble dining table that sits 8 comfortably. The kitchen is fully equipped with glass cabinetry, pantry, Noritake cutlery & crockery, full size stainless steel ref/freezer, stove top, oven, dishwasher, pots & pans, Nespresso coffee maker, electric kettle, Wolf toaster, Wolf bagel toaster, blender, Henckels knife block to name a few. Yes, they thought of everything for you. This place is all about the details. The suite was teched-out. There are various panels throughout to control the music which can be hooked up to your playlist, lighting (with dimmers) and doors. Each bedroom plus the living room has a touch screen tablet (4) to replace booklets/binders/menus you see at other hotels. The suite has USB outlets throughout, Dyson electric fan and centralized A/C. The property has a restaurant which was not yet in full operation during our stay. A full on bar with all the wines (even the very expensive), liquors you crave. One of the bedrooms opens to the balcony and faces the ocean (it is smaller than the other 2 rooms but worth the view), 1 large room was facing the side of the hotel with floor to ceiling windows & partial view of the ocean, 1 room did not have a view but it is a very good size room with an alcove and a pull out bed for a 3rd person. The single pull out had a surprisingly comfortable mattress and same luxe linens as the king bed so it is suitable for an adult. All beds are king size. Also, I have to mention that the view was not an issue in the slightest because the rooms are so beautiful, well appointed and completely stocked with everything you could possibly need. Beddings, towels, pillows (6 per bed) are all organic from Japan. Motorized blinds in bedrooms in place of curtains. Two bedrooms have small mini refrigerators. Each bedroom has a flat screen TV.The bathrooms are spa-like. They have top of the line Toto toilets and the tubs and walk-in showers have rain showers as well as multiple shower heads on the wall. There is a sauna in one of the bathrooms as well as a soaker tub in the other but all have the walk-in rain showers as well as double sinks, except for the smaller room (with a view) just one sink. Two of the 3 bathrooms have an enclosed loo with a Toto, telephone and privacy. Each of the three bathrooms have FHI curling and straightening irons, Dyson hair dryer, Bulgari amenities, ample walk-in closets, safe in each room, wooden & silk lined clothes hangers, 2 organic bathrobes. A one piece ensuite washer/dryer with detergent is located ensuite.. There is a separate service elevator for the cleaning crew that leads right into the suite which you are able to lock from the tablet or control panels located throughout.The only drawback is that the suite was so comfortable we were happy staying in!Service:Outstanding service from the valets, doorman, security, cleaning staff & front desk ....... 24 hrs top notch service via ensuite tablet, picking up the suite phone or calling from my mobile when we were away. We were given their utmost service & personalized attention. This is the beauty about this small property, you don’t get lost in the melee. In the lobby reception lounge you will find a wine vending machine that allows you sample some of their wines. THANK YOU, to all the staff at ESPACIO for showing us the true meaning of OHANA!",,frommima,3,5.0

As someone who travels frequently and has experienced many ultra-luxury properties around the world, ESPACIO exceeds expectations, especially compared to other luxury accommodations in Hawaii. There is truly nothing like this in Waikiki right now, perhaps in Hawaii itself. From five-star service/amenities to high-end design touches to incredible views - especially the rooftop pool area - ESPACIO is made for travelers looking to have every whim catered to. I had the best night's sleep in a bed that felt like a cloud. And the in-room wine amenity was a superb touch. Can't wait to go back, especially to experience the onsite restaurant Mugen.",,kristied12188,2,5.0

I was fortunate to enjoy a two-night stay and feel words alone can barely begin to describe it. For the cosmopolitan traveler who seeks solace and privacy, yet thrives at being at the center of it all, ESPACIO is the ideal retreat. An incredible concept in luxury hospitality unrivaled in Waikiki and perhaps the world.",,ejkelley,0,5.0

With my job, I get incredible opportunities to experience some of the best five star hotels and resorts around the world and this was up there with the very best. I have no doubt that they will soon be named one of the top hotel openings of 2019 and the best new hotel in Hawaii.First of all, this is not a standard hotel or resort so you should set your expectations. This feels and looks more like a private serviced group of luxury residences than a hotel. You are treated like family from the second you arrive (actually weeks before you arrive when the concierge contacts you to pre-arrange anything you may want). There are only 9 suites and each takes the entire floor they are on. They are configured as 2 bedroom plus an office or 3 bedroom residences with full kitchens. There is a spa onsite but they were still working through the opening so I didn't experience it. There is also a restaurant named onsite that will provide one of the most upscale dining experiences in Waikiki and will also provide room service. Upon check in, your refrigerator has some basic sodas/juices and they start you with a couple bottles of wine in your wine refrigerator. They will restock the water and juices as you use them. Another nice feature was an electronic wine delivery system in the lobby. They start you with $50 so you can try a few different types and then you can reload your card at the front desk. The location is so much better than the Ritz (6-7 blocks from the beach and in a sketchy neighborhood) and the Trump (2 blocks from the beach and way West of the heart of Waikiki). You are literally across the street from the beach and less than 2 blocks from the heart of shopping in Waikiki. The service was extremely anticipatory and non-intrusive. I don't think they ever told me ""no"" and I was intentionally trying to push the envelope to see how they would respond. We had the opportunity to book a private chef (Jason Yamaguchi who helps the onsite restaurant as well) on the rooftop. What an experience!! The food was out of this world and the wine pairings/knowledge of the food and beverage director was spot on. We had some of the best and most complex wines/beer that I have ever tried. This is really the only place I would recommend staying if you are looking for the most luxurious experience in Waikiki. The value, experience and location blows away the Ritz and Trump unless you are looking for that standard ""Ritz Resort Experience"".","Las Vegas, Nevada","337jimr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Las Vegas, Nevada</strong>",132,5.0
