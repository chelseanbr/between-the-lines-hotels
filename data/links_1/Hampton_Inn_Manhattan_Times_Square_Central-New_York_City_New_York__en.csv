The lobby looks new and beautiful, while the rooms are old and tired-- The toilet paper holders hang down broken, the bedside phone was DISGUSTING and looked like someone spilt coffee on it and never cleaned it up.When I walked into the room, the TV was broken so I called down to the desk. I ultimately got the TV to work, went to call down to tell the front desk and the phone wouldn't work. About half of the time, the phone worked, which from a safety perspective, is very worrisome. The night before departure, I confirmed a 1 PM check out with the front desk. The morning of check out, I was woken up at 8:30 AM by housekeeping knocking on my door. This shows me that either the departments at the hotel do not communicate, or they don't care. In a half-asleep rush to get up to tell the housekeeper about my late check out, I stubbed my toe.

It’s an amazing place to stay at with its own breakfast, viewing gallery, business center and shop. We went for breakfast on Tuesday and Thursday and loved it. A highlight was definitely the fresh smoothies and fresh waffles (different flavour choices). However, there are many other things available like cereals, muffins, pastries, omelettes, bacon, fruit and yogurts. The breakfast at Hampton inn is also one of the only in New York you get free. There was a lot more to offer then I was expecting! Throughout the day, the hotel has tea, coffee and ice water machines. There is also “chocolate milk” sachets with something that looks, and tastes, like hot chocolate. At mid-afternoon cookies are put on the reception desk warm and free to take. I would definitely recommend them! Finally, the hotel actually has its own viewing gallery on the roof/ top floor of the building. Unfortunately it was quite foggy when we went up but I’m sure it would look much better on a clearer night. Our room was perfectly sized and had a bath/shower in the bathroom included.

The staff were lovely especially Geraldine who helps with the breakfasts.The hotel provides free lovely cookies in the reception around 5-7pm.If you’re visiting NYC for the first time I would recommend the Staten Island ferry - at night or daytime, the top of the rock, walk through Central Park from west side and start around 92 street, the museum of natural history is also great and take a stroll around Grenwich or the east village.We enjoy food at Ellen’s diner and tick tock diner.

We were given a room on the 26th floor (think the hotel has 30/31 floors) room big enough, big comfy bed, the view was ok, could see Empire state building from the room (south side), very clean hotel and really friendly staff. Only downsides were breakfast, it could get really busy. Plenty of options to choose from but you need to get down before 7 am / 7.30 am to enjoy as it gets way to busy after 8 am/8.30 am and you'd be lucky to find a table. There was often nowhere to sit and people would overspill to the lobby, the other thing that spoilt it a little was that plastic cutlery, paper plates and cups were supplied.....I think the hotel is better than this. The second downside was in our room - the toilet door (not sure if this was just our room though as we were based by the fire exit and it could have been to save space), it was a sliding door and didn't offer much privacy as there was a gap of about an inch around the door. No one mentioned where to find ice (which can be found on the 11th floor). This would have been useful information during check-in or when purchasing drinks from the lobby shop (which is only small but good enough). Deposit of a $100 was requested but there are no resort fees. Free wifi which is always great. Hairdryer supplied which was excellent for a hotel one, there's no need to bring your own. Neutrogena products supplied daily i.e. shampoo/conditioner/soap etc. Room cleaned daily. Free cakes/cookies, tea/coffee and water at the reception area.

The property is clean and updated. The rooms are small, but we expected that in the city. There was a bit of a wait to check in. I observed many people ahead of me while waiting. I noticed that, unlike other couples, we did not receive two bottles of water though we are Hilton Honors members for years. The staff was not particularly friendly. They explained nothing, did not invite questions, etc. I had to ask about the key cards and breakfast. We did not realize that the room card was required for the elevator but quickly figured it out. Fortunately, we knew where we were going in the city. The breakfast area, though large, was packed with people. There was a good variety of items. I was looking for an empty table. When I found one, I had to wipe it off myself. There was coffee and tea in the lobby as well as the breakfast room. Generally, this is a nice, modern property and a good location. I think a little more effort on the part of desk staff would go a long way in making this an even better location.","Jenkintown, Pennsylvania","cityshoregirl</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Jenkintown, Pennsylvania</strong>",9,4.0

They have an observation deck on the roof which offers great views of the city, and it’s in a great location, close enough to walk to the tourist locations and shopping. Free WiFi was included with our room. You also get a complimentary breakfast everyday. The breakfast is a very good value, with either scrambled eggs or omelettes, sausage or bacon as hot food, plus make your own waffles. Also oatmeal and cereal, smoothies, juice, fruit, toast. The coffee is also quite good. I am going to nitpick and say that breakfast is REALLY crowded, and sometimes a wait for a table, plus it’s all paper plates, cups, plastic cutlery, so I’m really hoping the hotel is actively recycling this because the bins were full each and every day. Also every day they have a coffee bar in the lobby which you can help yourself to. My only other complaint is the elevators, which were incredibly busy, always full, and we ended up taking the stairs quite regularly, which is fine on the 6th floor but I’m certain someone on the 31rst floor might disagree.

We found this to be very close for 3 adults (although we are all family!) and it did impair our stay at this hotel. I asked if we could move but was told all rooms are the same sleeping area size (some entrance halls a little larger when placed next to a lift). Anyway, just so you are aware if you are regular sized adults, it's tight for sharing!!! We booked a Hampton as the breakfast is included - and it was breakfast and the breakfast service that we all enjoyed! Geraldine, the Irish breakfast manager, was amazing. And as much as she ran a tight ship in the restaurant (ie all foods were available, plentiful and the serving areas and tables were very clean and swiftly cleared), her natural warmth and enthusiasm for New York really helped us get the most from our stay.

Right across from the subway and so many places within walking distance. Walked to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th Ave, Bryant Park, Central Park, Macy's, and so many restaurants. Room Location - Since I was bringing my family of 4 there for 5 day over Christmas, I did a lot of research on room location. I had called and asked several questions as well. So I was ready to pick my room the day before through online checkin. I picked a room and called to make sure it met my needs. After being told by 2 different workers that the layout of the ""03"" rooms is the best I felt great about my choice. I got a confirmation that we were checked in to this room. However, when we physically arrived, they had us in a different room. When I questioned the lady, she made up a lie and said that since we requested a refrigerator, we can't have that room because a refrigerator cannot go in that room. This seemed crazy since the lady that helped me pick that room said that it would be great for a refrigerator. After pressing this a bit she got a manager and he said that the person never checked out of that room, so we couldn't have it. Strange since it usually only lets you do online checkin after there person had checked out. I assume they just gave it to someone else and were making up excuses. This started our stay off on a bad note.We ended up in 2212 (which of course they assured was a superb room. It was facing 41st street, which is not what I wanted for street noise. The good news is that the street noise was not as bad as I expected. We are night-owls so the noise seemed to calm down when we were asleep. You could hear things, but we ran the fan on constant and used a white noise machine. Elevators - As noted on many reviews, you can wait 10-15 minutes at times. I would say either stay super low so you can use stairs, or super high. For getting a down elevator, the elevator always goes to the highest floor first and then stops at every floor requested on the way down. So the poor folks on floors lower than 20 got passed up all of the time because the elevator was always full. I felt really bad for those with full luggage carts who could not take the stairs. We only had issues a few times since we were usually leaving the building after busy checkout time. Breakfast - As noted on many reviews it is a zoo. It is a great perk that they offer this, but you need to have an incredible amount of patience to get your food. People are going in all directions and cut in front of you and bump you. The should re-design this room to have one long buffet bar going down he middle with access from both sides. The pinch points in the corners is awful. The last few days I just grabbed a ""To-Go"" bag and ate in my room. These bags are a great perk as well (small water bottle, apple, Nutri-grain bar, muffin). The staff that works this are great though. Always there to help. They will get you a banana if you ask for one!Lobby - Busiest lobby I have ever seen. It is small and so many people getting the free water/tea/coffee and waiting for rides or to check in.Front Desk - As mentioned above, we did not have a good checkin experience. Also, they assured us at check in that the refrigerator we requested for medical reasons was already in the room. It was not and never came. We had to call concierge to get it delivered. A few other times during our stay we asked the front desk for extra towels. They never came either, so we had to call concierge. Activities Planner/Helper - They have someone to answer questions and help with planning for a part of the day. They were very helpful! A nice perk!Rooms - Very clean and look to be recently updated. They are NYC small, but clean is so important and I have no complaints with that.","Overland Park, Kansas","texansinoz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Overland Park, Kansas</strong>",9,4.0

It was a pretty hectic schedule with my wife wanting to look at the Christmas displays in all of the store windows but the one constant was the hotel. The room was clean and the staff was very nice throughout our stay. The front desk stored our bags until our room was ready and then stored them after we checked out (they gave us late checkout, too, so ask if you need it) until our shuttle arrived to go to the airport. The free breakfast was very popular and I have included photos of when it was busy and when I caught it during a lull on Thursday after many people had left for the parade (Served from 6:00 to 10:00 a..m.). I generally do not sleep well on my first night in a hotel but the bed was very comfortable and I got a great night's sleep both nights. Many hotels have pillows that are too thick but the Hampton Inn had 4 pillows on our bed - two were thicker than I prefer but the other two were just right! Kudos to them for providing two different sizes instead of taking the easy way out and just have one size fits all. In the shower, there was a nice touch for the ladies -- in the corner there is a bar about 10""-12"" off of the floor for you to rest your foot on while you shave your legs. I must also add that the ladies in the breakfast area were also very nice, working continuously to keep everything replenished. One also offered to take a photo of my wife and I when she saw us trying to get a good selfie! Eggs and meat are present every morning but may be different each day -- we had scrambled eggs one morning with sausage patties and the next it was cheese omelets and sliced link sausage. There are also juices, milk, cereal, various breads and rolls, two (2) toasters, smoothies, coffee, boiled eggs, and waffles! There is sure to be something for everyone. It is also convenient, only a short walk to the subway and several restaurants. The hotel also provides coffee and water in the lobby 24 hours a day, as well as 3 computers for your use and a fitness room. If you want a different view than you have from your room, one of the elevators goes to a viewing area on the roof, which I believe is the 32nd floor.

Convenient and safe. However their customer service is the worst we’ve experienced in NY. Checked in and our room was boiling hot. Turned on the air and left for 5 hours. Came back and it was even hotter. Called the desk and they sent a maintenance guy. He tinkered around and said “it should work now” but it was still blowing warm air (not hot now). Called back down to ask about a new room. Very rude. Had to basically threaten to call the cc company to cancel the payment to get a new room. Breakfast was good but so over crowded you couldn’t get to much of anything and the dining room has so many tables packed in you can barely walk thru. We had originally planned to stay wed-sun but there is a winter storm coming in so we decided to check out on Saturday. We go down to the desk to tell them that on Friday and are being told we will be charged $150 anyway. I would NEVER recommend this hotel just because of crappy customer service. We have found most service oriented people’s we have dealt with in the city to be exceptionally mice but not here.

What an impressive way to start the day and to make us feel that our business is valuable to them.We arrived in the early afternoon and were greeted warmly by none other than Lilly herself. She immediately got us in checked in, made suggestions for where we would like our room (we chose the 25th floor), and got a young man to Valet park our car. She could not have been more gracious and sets the standard by which you would like to be treated upon arriving at a hotel. Well done Lilly!Our room was spacious, very, very clean, and overall very comfortable. Our room had a city view which in itself was amazing. Breakfast in the morning was excellent and had a number of offerings including omelets, waffles,sausage, Danish, cereals, fruit and other assorted breakfast items. It was well stocked and plentiful. The breakfast room is larger than it looks when first entering and it too was ultra clean.Service staff and maintenance people were abundant and every single one of them greeted you in a friendly manner and always with a nice smile and kind words.I have seen other reviews where some people complained about the elevator service. I found the complaints to be completely unfounded as we never, not even once, had any issue with elevator service. We never waited more than a couple of minutes and once in, the elevator was fast. An added feature is that, elevators are not accessible unless you have your room key and swipe it. Once you swipe it, you can then select the floor that your room is located on.The hotel is convenient to everything in Times Square. We walked to Radio City Music Hall, about a 15 minute walk that seemed shorter and to Rock Center which is across the street from RCMH. Those were the longest walks we had. Great restaurants, theatres, and numerous bars for a cocktail are abundant within a 5 or 10 minute stroll, or shorter, from the hotel.Check out was smooth and efficient. The valet service does take a little bit of time as cars are parked at an off-site location.Overall, this was truly an exceptional experience. The front desk service from Lilly, the housekeeping staff, breakfast room attendants, and the valet service combined with a clean, comfortable, and quiet room made for a very, very pleasant experience.

The rooms and bathrooms were very clean and nicely updated, and there were no stains or signs of wear on the furniture and bedding. The employees stood out for their friendliness; every time a member of the maintenance department was on the elevator, they greeted the other passengers, and several times I witnessed the breakfast staff cheerfully helping fulfill an individual request in the midst of very crowded dining room. While I did not use the services of the concierge, it was good to know that this was an option.

It is just a block or two off the craziness of Times Square with a subway stop right across the street from the hotel. It's a close walk to the Theaters and many restaurants. One of the best parts was having a breakfast included before starting our busy day. Yes the breakfast room does get busy as mentioned but we always found a seat and there is additional seating in the lobby if you make a plate and take it out there. Great variety at breakfast - if you don't like the hot options there was always much more - smoothies, bagels, fruit, muffins etc. One day we had to be at Good Morning America at 6:00 am and they had grab and go breakfast ready in a bag at the front desk and we grabbed a coffee and ate breakfast in line for GMA. Not buying breakfast or coffee saved us a lot in NYC! It was also nice that the hotel had water, coffee, tea etc available in the lobby 24/7 and cookies often as well. Everyone we encountered at Hampton was friendly and eager to help in any way needed. Good value for the money - we paid ~$350 per night but remember you are in the heart of Manhattan and breakfast included. We ended up getting Sunday night half price through a Hilton Honors promotion.

The entire hotel was very clean and housekeeping did a good job.The staff we came across was helpful and efficient. We organized our car to Newark airport through the hotel and the price was ok and service timely.We could not check out the rooftop view but view from the room was fine.There is a small shop at the lobby for soft drinks and similar items which was helpful for us. The hotel also provides free tea and coffee at the lobby.Considering what I have written so far it should have been five stars but I cannot give that due to problem with elevators and breakfast.As mentioned by others, there are only three elevators and it is not enough for a hotel of this size during the morning rush hours which starts around 8 am. We had to wait for nearly twenty minutes to get into the elevator one day. If you are going to the airport in the morning then make sue you have sufficient time in hand.The hotel provides breakfast which in included in the room rate. The food was ok but the size of the breakfast room is too small with insufficient seating arrangements. Unless you start your breakfast before 7 am getting a table is doubtful. In fact we had to skip the hotel breakfast one day as there were no place to sit and it was way beyond over crowded. Please note there is no other restaurant at the hotel.As a conclusion if you are looking for central location, decent price and a clean hotel and will not mind avoiding the morning rush and skip hotel breakfast then this is highly recommended.",Dubai,"Teertha G</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dubai</strong>",89,4.0

But this Hampton Inn on 41st between 7-8th Ave was perfect! Much better area right in the theatre area. My wife felt very safe in this area during the day and evening. I liked the fact that the subway is a half block away as well as the Port Authority bus terminal where the convenient affordable airport buses are coming and going. The theatre district is full of fine restaurants and Hells Kitchen area is only a few blocks away. The Hampton is moderately priced and I like that they have complimentary breakfast each morning. Our two queen room was large and had a refrigerator. One convenience we missed though was a room safe.

It wasn’t huge, but our family of 4 (two in their teens) did just fine. AC and bathroom were flawless.The price might seem high for a Hampton Inn, but keep in mind that you’re in NYC. We have a friend who got us a room rate nearby for more than twice the price. We’ve stayed at that place before and know it’s in nowhere near as nicely kept.A couple of things you have to know, and this is probably a big city issue more than a problem with the hotel—you have to anticipate the crowd/time. Go to breakfast early. Our first morning, we had an early tour so we had the place pretty much to ourselves at 7. The next day at 10 was a different story! (They do have food that you can just grab and go) The hotel has four elevators and maybe 26 floors of about a dozen rooms each. At peak times, you WILL be waiting for the elevator.

So close to all of the times square attractions, the subway, and the bus terminal if you are arriving in on the Newark Airport Express bus from the EWR airport (just a half of a block walk from the bus terminal to the hotel). We arrived before check in, and the hotel desk stored our bags in a locked room so that we could explore the city until our room was ready. We chose a room on the second floor due to reading reviews about the hassle with the elevators. We are glad we made this choice. The convenience of taking the stairs (4 flights of stairs from the lobby to the second floor) during the breakfast rush made us very happy with our decision. We did not see any problems with elevator wait times at any other point during the day throughout our one week stay in June though. It is really just a concern at breakfast time. On the first day, we lucked out and found one dining table open to eat at during breakfast. The other days, it was so busy, that we just took our food back up to our room and ate there due to lack of seating. Take note of the sign that the hotel posts about breakfast busy times - we found it to be pretty accurate, so to avoid a wait, go early! The room was nice and clean. The beds were okay - not the most comfy, but not the worst. We were worried about street noise being on the second floor, but it was not a problem at all. There is the occasional siren that you hear, but other than that, noise was not that bad because 41st street was not a particularly noisy street. The only problem we had with the room was actually a pretty annoying problem. Mosquitoes! We kept finding mosquitoes in our room and I am highly allergic to mosquito bites - where the bites turn into welts, then bruises, then blisters - not fun. Well, we would kill the ones we would see, but I still would get bit. Then we would leave for the day and come back in the evening and find that the room had more mosquitoes! I don't know how they were getting in. We did notice that the windows to the outside opened slightly, so my guess is that housekeeping either opened the windows while they were cleaning each day which let in the mosquitoes, or they were traveling through the vents. Either way, I have never had a mosquito problem in a hotel room like I did here. No matter how many we would kill, there were more, and they kept biting me so that I would wake up with fresh bites each morning. I did mention the problem upon checkout, so hopefully they can address where the mosquito problem is coming from and treat it. However, even with the mosquitoes, this really was a lovely hotel and a very friendly staff - we really enjoyed our stay.","Dayton, Ohio","lisalovestraveling</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dayton, Ohio</strong>",3,4.0

At first wasn't happy with room size, it was small, (city view king) and lack of some amenities - no mini fridge or microwave. Don't know if that's a code thing for NYC or not, unlike other Hamptons that offer them. Made our reservation directly, the woman on the phone was wonderful and so helpful. Upon arrival in late afternoon, valet didn't take long and helpful while we were putting things on cart to bring in. Yes it's a bit pricey per day for valet but much rather have my car to get there and go home. You don't take it out other than that. Had city view king size room with great view, especially first day, only day we actually saw any sun, can't blame hotel for weather. When I first saw room, wasn't thrilled. Far smaller than any Hampton Inn room I'd had, felt a bit old, purple carpet needs to go, purple black out drapes don't exactly black out, they'reabout 2 inches too short so the light comes streaming in morning time, night time not too bad but the city lights definitely act like a big night light thru the drapes.Hotel pics show a king size room as having a comfortable looking sitting chair but when we got up there, it was only a work desk and chair. Coming to NYC there's a lot of walking and I wanted a comfortable chair to relax in and was shown as part of the room. Went down to the front desk to ask where said chair was, young woman said she didn't know what rooms had those chairs (?) but a manager was right there and immediately said they would bring a chair up to our room. To their credit, chair arrived in 5 minutes delivered by a nice gentleman from housekeeping. We smooshed it in next to the end corner of the bed as the room wasn't that big. Like to see less workspace size and rigid work chair and more of a nice true comfortable sitting chair to relax and enjoy that view with at the end of the day, especially for the cost of the rooms...yes I know it's NYC, rooms are pricey but for pricey I want it comfy. Not much room to put clothes away, 3 small drawers attached to work space desk and a closet. Kept our things in our suitcases for 4 days, used closet to hang up a couple of things. Bathroom, was spacious enough, housekeeping would just give us more towels when we asked. Was disappointed to start putting things out on the counter and realized there was someone's hair right by the hotel soaps and it wasn't mine. Countertop didn't seem clean rest of bathroom did. Broke out some hand sanitizer and wiped down counter and got rid of hair. The duvet didn't have the usual card on it as other Hamptons that say it's basically fresh and clean, always a nice touch to see but not this go around so far as a note but appeared clean. Elevators, in our 4 days we never waited anytime I would even consider close to being long and we were in and out of the building frequently and close to a top floor. Elevator was quick once we got in and selected our floor. Roof top observation deck bit of a let down, expecting more like a patio type but guess that's not possible up on a 32nd floor and there wasn't really a lot of room up there, but it's worth taking a quick look around. Bed, comfortable, shower, always hot water, room, much smaller than I expected a king city view would be. Quiet except for heavy slam sound of neighboring doors. For so many people being there, we had quiet nights. Breakfast was busy but we got in, got our food and we did find seating each day. Waffles are always available and cereals, fruit, muffins, yogurt, juice, coffee, teas, bacon, sausage, etc. It would be nice to offer scrambled eggs every day and then an extra option like the western omelet or plain cheese omelet but that's just personal choice. But still a little hint to the Hampton Inn for breakfast offering. Geraldine works in the breakfast area, she is sweet, happy and hard working. Tea, coffee, cocoa, cold water, etc available all day by registration desk. All in all for a first time stay, we enjoyed it. Hotel staff polite and helpful.With volume of people coming to front desk it can get hectic, but it's a customer service job, for the most part all the staff seemed customer service oriented. Not sure of other Hamptons in area, may check them out but overall this was a good experience, wish room was a bit more comfortable in size but location was fantastic.","Boston, Massachusetts","Naples72</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",8,4.0

Also the noise coming from outside is terrrible, some soundproofing would be much appreciated. I couldn’t sleep well because of this.Issue #2, the elevators take a lot of time and are most of the times full. I think 3 elevators for all the floors and rooms is not enough? All 5 days of my stay it took me between 5 to 15 minutes (the worst day) to go down to first level from 19th floor.Issue #3, on the last day of my stay I left 8 am my room and came back 4Pm, to see my room wasn’t cleaned up. This is unacceptable for so many hours they could have taken care of my room. An apology is not enough, I had to leave my room for a couple of hours to let the hotel to take care of this.Would probably stay back again, but only if the management takes care of these issues, if not I would not come back again.","Lima, Peru","WilliamDyer</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lima, Peru</strong>",36,3.0

I am a fairly faithful Hilton Honors Guest, so I most often make reservations on line. Shortly before we traveled, I wanted to ensure our rooms were in close proximity, and even, perhaps, adjoining. Although it is possible to do this “in a little box” online, I opted to call the hotel directly. I spoke to Olivia, who was at the Front Desk. I explained the situation and she explained the configurations and possibilities. At that time there was no availability, but Olivia assured me she would note the request and that they would make the appropriate accommodations should there be cancellations and changes. When we arrived, I merely gave my name and confirmation number. The clerk replied with a genuine smile, oh yes, Miss *** your rooms are ready, we were able to make the appropriate changes and you have adjoining rooms. I looked at her name tag, and it was Olivia. She took care of the situation, remembered our conversation, and greeted me in a warm and friendly manner. Throughout our stay she was most helpful, almost thinking one step ahead of our needs. Every hotel should have at least one Olivia. Although the hotel is fairly good size, it is set up in a way as to not be overwhelming. There is a comfortable well-lit lobby area, suited for gathering and snacks. Beverages are always available. I particularly liked that one must use a room key in order to access the buttons in the elevator. This is a good security feature.  The Hampton breakfast buffet was busy, but the staff kept right on top of things. The food was always fresh, and the associates were efficient at clearing tables keeping the area clean; and they did it all with smiles.  The rooms were very clean, and the housekeeping staff very friendly and helpful. They were discreet in not disturbing, yet efficient in offering supplies and doing daily cleaning. One in our party became ill. Olivia and the rest of the front desk team were most helpful in providing things we needed, telling us where the closet urgent care was located, and so forth. The manager allowed us to keep one room through the afternoon until we had to leave for the airport so the patient could rest comfortable. I put this in the category of going above and beyond. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone searching for a place to stay in the Times Square area. The property is wonderful, but the staff totally outstanding.","Myrtle Beach, South Carolina","retiredtraveller04</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Myrtle Beach, South Carolina</strong>",24,5.0

We had reservations for dinner at Tony's in between the shows and were able to come back to the hotel to relax before we had to go back to the second part of our show. There is free coffee, hot chocolate and tea in the lobby which is great. The front desk helped us reserve a private car to JFK (so easy - $75) and we ate the free breakfast buffet around 7 am. There were people there at that time but it was not crowded at all. The breakfast opens at 6 am. Rooms are fine, pretty standard but clean. Bed was comfy and it was quiet on our floor. We did see alot of teens in the hotel so I think large groups do come to stay and could get rowdy but we didn't see that. The elevators were readily available to us and we did not have to wait long. There is so much food nearby and the subway is just down the block. I was against staying in Times Square for our entire trip and stayed on E. 40th street for the rest of our stay but I do regret that now.

These things happen, but the reason I stayed overnight (rather than commute) was so I could shower and change between a conference and a work dinner. Instead I went directly to the dinner and was in the same outfit for 16 hours. They did check our bags at the front desk, so at least I wasn’t carrying that around.I checked in around 11 PM by a super-friendly staffer (Jeremy N). There were snacks in the lobby (I didn’t get a good look), the room was clean, the bed was comfortable (it seems like a newer location).

A couple of blocks away from the middle of Times Square and a block from the subway station. TIP: skip the taxi and Uber if flying into JFK. You can take the AirTrain to Sutphin Station and jump on the E train to 42nd Port Authority station which is a 3 min walk to the hotel. $8 per person vs $80 on Uber! We were greeted promptly upon entering and were checked-in in minutes! The hotel itself is nice, clean, and comfortable. We'd definitely stay here again if we're in the area. The only con is the walls are thin. We stayed on the 9th floor (room 910) facing 41st and we could hear the garbage trucks every night/morning as well as people yelling in the street. When the guy next door got on a work call, we heard most of what he said too. That said, we are not light sleepers so we only heard these things because we were already awake. However, if you are a light sleeper, you might want to keep looking.","San Jose, California","wanderingfattie</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",4,4.0

All the staff are amazing, very helpful and do all they can to make your stay perfect. I’d emailed beforehand to ask for a room with a shower rather than a bath on a higher floor and got exactly what I requested, the room was fantastic, spotlessly clean with the most comfortable beds that we did not want to get out of! Breakfast has a great choice of cereals, waffles, yoghurts, pastries, omelettes, sausages, fresh fruit, tea/coffee/juice plus there are little bags you can take out from reception with water, a cereal bar & a muffin, hot drinks available 24/7 with a little area where you can purchase other snacks. I really cannot fault this Hotel and have just booked to go back next January with my daughter, cannot wait and I totally recommend this Hotel, you will not be disappointed, I just wish I could remember names of the wonderful staff, next time I will be sure to write them down as they all deserve a mention as nothing was too much trouble for any of them and always had a chat & a smile with us each day.

We stayed for 7 nights - the rooms must be soundproof because did not hear a thing from what felt like a full hotel! Slept really well despite the time differences from the UK and the fact we were right on times square - was a bit concerned at first it would be too loud but it wasn't. Being near times square also had it's advantages - we were very close to a Walgreen's for any essentials. The room has a good sized bed, spacious shower with a good sized sink and mirror. Very very clean. There is also a safety deposit box, tea/coffee, iron and a hairdryer, and a decent sized television. The lobby was great to see, the staff on the desk were pleasant and very helpful. There is a small shop next to reception desk, it's reasonably priced, it's mainly snacky things like ice creams, crisps, chocolate etc, there are small microwaveable pizzas but the microwave is for everyone, guess it's a good emergency option to have.The best bit by far was breakfast - especially seeing Geraldine every morning, she was very accommodating, lovely to chat to, always full of tips, always looked forward to telling her the next morning what we had done through the day before. I know my auntie is now booking to come back to this hotel, not only for the great experience we had but because she wants to see Geraldine again! Breakfast is very varied, my favourite and morning ritual being a waffle (with everything on top - whipped cream, chocolate sauce, raspberry sauce), fruit loop cereal - sometimes I'd throw a yoghurt, bananas, muffins within the mix - but there was a lot more - sausages, eggs, bagels etc. The area was kept very clean, heavily recommend going as close to 6am as possible as it does get quite hectic. Geraldine also gave us some lunch bags (which are also available form the desk) which included water, a muffin and a cereal bar, i'd also grab some bananas from the breakfast mix to take too. These were a life saver. We always have a good big breakfast so these snacks lasted us well until the evening for our next big meal. My only criticism of the hotel would be 3 elevators is a bit of a nightmare, they do get quite full and sometimes you have to wait a while - but as I was on holiday, was hardly in a rush and quite happy to stand around. Would definitely recommend, would go back tomorrow.

So I can certainly say, hands down this is the best Hampton Inn in Manhattan. Pros:- Rooms: very clean, modern, nice sized TV with a lot of channels. Modern and spotless bathrooms. -Location: in the heart and middle of everything exciting in Manhattan. Transportation galore (cabs, uber, subway, bikes, etc). You can walk to anything. Too many restaurants to count. Lots of stores. I mean it's perfect for a tourist or a business person. Great also if you are a family with kids. Super safe neighborhood.-Breakfast: that is where they shine. Great service (that guy attending the breakfast room is very polite, helpful, attentive and kind). Great and diverse choice. It tastes really good. Honestly, they rock! Option offered if you are on the go (bag with fruit, water and bars). Enough said!- Free hot chocolate, tea, coffee etc all day long- Great and functional amenities (laundry room). - Front desk: most friendly people. So helpful and try to go above and beyond. Its been consistently my experience with them the many times I went there. You really feel welcome.Cons:- the rooms are small. But expected for a newer hotel in Manhattan.- the cleaning staff should be more careful with making sure the towels are spotless (hair and stains will always be gross, sorry). During several visits, I had to request other towels.I have been to a lot of other Hampton Inns in the city. Despite its minor flaws, this one surpasses them all by far.

My kids would eat between the 9-10am hour which was crowded and seats scarce. If you intend to eat breakfast on-site, plan to eat early. We loved the free hot tea and coffee in the lobby. It was really popular because the hot water was always out but quickly refilled by staff. The hot cookies were easy to miss partly because certain families don’t teach their kids to share. One time, a dad told his son not to take the last THREE cookies and to instead leave one for my daughter who was waiting to grab one. OR, you could tell your entitled son to only grab one cookie because he’s not the only kid in the hotel who wants one; regardless of whether another kid is waiting for a cookie or not.

A special shout out to Benson (friendly and always smiling and working hard), Johnny (from MN) who gave us tips and helped with our luggage and John the concierge (awesome reservations for dinner). The beds here are comfortable and we found it to be very quiet. Make sure to go to the roof top to take in a great view. The location can not be beat; we were so close to everything.

Check in was great, we were given a room on the 30th floor out of 31.. this was great as I actually requested a city view, and what an amazing view of the Empire State lit up at night. The whole view was spectacular. Obviously being high up has its drawbacks, mainly being breakfast and waiting for the elevator. I had read time and time again regarding the queue which is why we went down around 7am each morning. If you go between 6 and 7.30 it will probably come straight up to you. One morning we went early, back to the room to collect stuff and went out to explore the city around 9am. It took nearly 10 minutes from waiting for the lift, to then stopping at floor after floor to the bottom. We were like sardines by the ground floor. On the first night I thought I would attempt the stairs to the bottom. It was ok going down but back up was exhausting.. 417 steps each way!! Staff really helpful and nothing was too much trouble. I was told by another guest at breakfast you can go up to the roof top after the 31st floor and we done that on the last day. A lovely balcony with great views. This was a great hotel and offered everything you need.. A safe in room, lovely big bed, great views.. My critisms were the shower was poor, hardly any pressure. The sliding bathroom door was so impersonal. Not a great design which don’t give much privacy when going toilet. And lastly we had the most annoying extractor fan in the bathroom which didn’t seem to turn off, so if you woke at night you struggled to go back to sleep.

Just a minutes walk to the subway and Times Square. 5th Avenue 5 minute walk and very well placed to get around. Our room was on the 7th floor with 2 comfy beds, clean bathroom with lovely white fluffy towels, and plenty of room to get around. The breakfast was plentiful with fresh fruit/yogurts/porridge/cereals/Boiled eggs/scrambled eggs/ bacon or sausages on alternate days/ bread/bagels/muffins/ and Waffle maker (for you to make your own!!) with all different sauces and syrups. We never had a problem finding a table. BUT the highlight of breakfast was definitely Geraldine the restaurant supervisor what an ASSET to the hotel she is, always friendly, informative and so helpful ( one morning I lost my voice, she was soon at my side with a lemon cut up in a bowl, so I could have a Hot lemon drink) Also John on the concierge desk was very helpful. The only downside to the Hotel is the elevators one was out of action while we were there, and being in the 7th floor was very difficult to get it to stop, always going past, and if did stop was usually packed. Had to use the stairs quite a lot. Saying that I wouldn’t let that stop me from using the hotel again or from recommending it to others.

The room is of pretty good size by NYC standards and had everything required for a good night's stay including a very nice shower. The bed is comfy and the heating/cooling is very easy to control. The breakfast is excellent but would advise go early. The only downside was that all the ""crockery"" and cutlery was plastic/cardboard. It was all clearly marked recyclable, but if you wash up there's nothing to recycle. I realise this is part of keeping costs down but at what price to the planet? The lobby area is very pleasant with 24 hour free tea and coffee, a shop for confectionery, crisps, beer, forgotten items etc and an internet access area. Excellent. If you want show tickets, go see the lovely John. He is amazingly helpful and very friendly. The location just off Times Square is perfect and you are no more than a 2 minute walk to the Subway.

We got checked in and when the elevator door opened we saw the door to our room just opposite in a narrow hall. Tired and cranky, our reaction to the room was ""why did we book this hotel?"" After a night's sleep we saw that the room was actually nice and very spacious for Manhattan and we realized that we heard no noise from the elevator, hall or nearby rooms. The location is fantastic. The subway is virtually across the street. There are plenty of restaurants nearby, shopping, theaters. The room was very clean with lots of towels, storage, comfortable beds. Breakfast got crowded at times, but the food variety was decent and there was a lot of staff. They offered carry out boxes when they saw that I was trying to carry food up to the room. There is coffee round the clock in the lobby along with hot water and tea and cocoa packets. In the evening they bake cookies as well. The best thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone was helpful and cheerful. Several staff members really went out of their way to ask if we needed anything. For Hilton Gold members, they offered daily water and had a selection of snacks to choose from. We found it was more than we needed, but they always asked if we wanted something more.

Our room was on the 21st floor, big enough for us and our cases (and later bags and bags of shopping!) and there are 3 elevators that service all the floors (only really really busy in the morning but longest wait was about 5 mins). We took the buffet breakfast option and have to say we were really glad we did, there are all the breakfast foods anyone could wish for, we mastered the art of the waffle maker by the second day (became such old hands at it we were demonstrating how it worked to the newbies), but there are fruits, hot items, yogurts, cerial etc....something for everyone. Also the breakfast supervisor Geraldine was a joy to talk to first thing in the morning, always humerous, pleasant, positive and full of useful info about the best way to get somewhere, the best places to shop, basically a mine of information happy to answer all our questions, which we really appreciated. Geraldine also kept the dining room ticking over with no problem, she would clean and clear your table without you noticing she'd even been there! The housekeping staff were great, the room was cleaned daily and to a high standard. Also need to mention Louis (concierge), what a asset to the hotel! Louis is one of those guys that knows all the inside/local knowledge and can furnish you with directions to anywhere, get you a taxi, and ensure you have a wee bag of supplies for the airport (water, sweets, nuts...). We were able to store our luggage at the hotel until we left later in the day, were able to access bathroom for quick freshen up and change before leaving for the airport.

My brother and his wife met us at our hotel as we were checking in. When we were offered water and cookies, they were as well even though they weren't ""guests."" This was a very hospitable gesture in a place where everything is pricy. The room was bigger than most and the hotel itself was as close to ""pristine"" as I have encountered. We had room service each day. The breakfast was very good and lasted us until dinnertime. We were fortunate to find ""normally priced"" restaurant a block away. (Ruby Tuesdays) The proximity of the hotel to both the several Metro stops as well as to our ""Hop on Hop off"" Gray line tour stops. Because we were first timers, we didn't realize we needed to book a shuttle to return to the airport 24 hours in advance, but John, the Consierge, was able to find just what we needed in a couple of hours on a very busy day. A real advantage to staying here is that when you check out, they will let you check your bags with the bell boy to be kept in their secured storage area for up to 24 hours without charge. (That deserved a big tip!) Doing so made it possible for us to spend several more hours in the city. This is a great place to stay in a convenient location a minute's walk off TImes Square. It was quiet on our 6th floor. I loved how secure I felt when I realized no one could access the elevator without a room key.

The things deserve two starts are the location and that it's clean.I'll start with value for money we paid $307 per night booked a month ago on the hotel's site. When we arrived at the hotel we found out we paid 80% more than current rates (also directly to the hotel's site). With a cold laconic correspondence with Hilton that got us very annoyed at the very beginning of our stay.When we arrived at the hotel the receptionist was very kind and on a by the way suggested we will have breakfast early because the lifts might be busy between 6am and 10am... Little did we know...For a hotel with 25 floors and so many rooms you would expect the horel to provide suitable dining area and lifts. Hampton Inn forgot to do that. Or simply doesn't care.There are 3 lifts for the whole building. Stopping at every floor. We found ourselves cramped well beyond maximum weigh for the lift with people saying they have been waiting for the lift for 30 minutes. Worse than the subway!When we arrived at the fameus breakfast finally, it is nothing special or interesting it just not enough. Not enough food to feed the number of people at the dining area and not not enough room to sit. It was so crowded and loud and as result dirty as well.The cherry on the top is the use of paper plates and plastic tableware. Bad for the environment and basically disrespectful. I would expect a hotel proud of its Hilton heritage to have higher standards in service and operation. ",,AyeletAK,22,2.0

It was very convenient and saved me some money on breakfast. There are some very good tee/coffee options 24/7 in the lobby too. The The building is 31 fl high, so even though I had the top floor, I couldn't see much of Manhattan, but at least it wasn't looking at a wall or someone's window.I loved the room - the bed and pillows were very comfortable. Plenty of power sockets next to the bed and desk. Because of the high floor, I couldn't hear the traffic.

We reserved our room online using the Hilton HHonors website, and we remitted Hilton points for a complimentary stay. Although we were offered the option to check in online the day prior to our stay, we declined.The Hampton Inn Times Square Central opened in June 2015 on West 41st Street (between 7th and 8th Avenues) in Midtown, just one block from the Port Authority bus terminal (which also offers vehicle parking and subway stops). This property is centrally located to many tourist areas such as Times Square, Broadway theaters, shops and restaurants, and Bryant Park. It is a few blocks walk to Penn Station, Madison Square Garden, the Empire State Building, and Macy’s Herald Square.The hotel offers a 32nd floor rooftop observation deck, complimentary buffet breakfast (or alternately, a grab-and-go weekday breakfast bag), fitness center, private meeting space for 12 people, and a pantry shop (where you can purchase drinks, snacks, forgotten items, and souvenirs). Local artwork and photographs decorate the public spaces. This newer hotel features what Hampton Inn calls its “Perfect Mix Lobby”, which has seating and lighting options for both business and vacation travelers. The Hampton Inn Times Square Central offers 300 rooms in several categories: King, Two Doubles, King City View, or Two Doubles City View. Room amenities include complimentary Wi-Fi, flat-screen TVs, coffee makers, safes (that fit a laptop), irons/ironing boards, and clock radios. Bathrooms include oversize walk-in showers (most do not have a traditional bathtub/shower combination), hairdryers, and toiletries (soap, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion). Although we booked a king room, when we checked in early, only double-bedded rooms were available, so we accepted one. Our room was cozy, with a closed/desk/TV unit located opposite the beds, and a bathroom with a sliding door next to one of them. The bathroom itself was a good size, larger than some we have seen in the city. Although our room was located directly across from the elevator bank (with three elevators), it was quiet and we did not hear any hallway noise. But it was on the smaller size, the beds were doubles instead of queens, and the odd location of the bathroom door was bothersome and did not provide maximum privacy. (Positioned at the middle of the floor near the elevators, we think that our room was a bit smaller than some others and also that our bathroom door was in an alternate location than in other rooms, but we cannot say for sure.)Our stay at the Hampton Inn Time Square Central was acceptable, but we prefer alternate Hilton-branded locations in the same area for similar cost.",Pennsylvania,"fluffnfold</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Pennsylvania</strong>",920,3.0

The hotel has posted a list of times when the breakfast area is the busiest. Clearly more needs to be done.-The hotel advertises a rooftop deck, however it is small, there is no place to sit down there and the view is not that good. -Even though its near Times square, you will not get a Times Square view from the rooms.-The rooms need a refrigerator. There wasn't one in our room.-The lobby is small and seemed crowded.If you are not that concerned about the view, or getting an elbow in your ribcage at the breakfast, this may the hotel for you.

First let me say the rooms are very nice as is the lobby. Service was great and very friendly. Breakfast offering was pretty good. Location is great if you want Times Square/Central. Now for the downsides and reason for only 3 stars, some of which the hotel cannot change. #1: there are only 3 elevators servicing 30 floors so average elevator transport time was 7 minutes each way. During ""off times"" (ie middle of the day) you might only wait 3-5. The elevator waits are EXTREMELY annoying. I suggest you request a lower floor and use the stairs. #2 construction noise: We were awakened 3 of the 4 mornings by VERY loud construction adjacent to the hotel. We had ""white noise"" makers on to help with sleep, but it made no difference. It was a heavy pounding and it looks like construction just started. #3:. Breakfast chaos: while the food offering and area is nice (and staff very helpful), when you have ~ 300 rooms trying to eat around the same time in that small an area, it is very chaotic and hectic. You either get lucky and get a spot to sit, or need to take it back to the room (see #1 above). Breakfast was a stressful, unpleasant experience. The two closest ice machines to us on 22nd and 27th floors were both broken....I expect more from a $350/night hotel. Due to all this, I could not recommend this hotel as nice as the staff was.","Austin, Texas","Centex68</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",49,3.0

Cold water and coffee were available in the lobby. The room was a city view with two double beds and was very clean and comfortable. Enough outlets and chargers for phones. We were on the 30th floor and had good water pressure. We did not go to breakfast, my husband went down and said it was very crowded (10 a.m.)so grabbed some coffee in the elevator. They did let us know that it would be crowded around that time, so we weren't surprised. On our way out, we picked up a to-go bag at the front desk - a muffin and granola bar was just enough to get us started. We didn't have trouble waiting for the elevator as some have mentioned. The only thing was housekeeping knocked on the door at 9 a.m... This hotel is near Times Square but just far away so not to feel so crazy. It was nice to come back to after a long day of sightseeing. Felt like it was an excellent value-Would stay again.","Holly Springs, North Carolina","caryjerr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Holly Springs, North Carolina</strong>",8,4.0

The staff is nice and helpful, especially Jeremy at the the check-in desk. My room had two queen beds, a small desk, chest of drawers, small closet, in-room safe, coffee maker, iron and hair drier. It was nice that there were plenty of electrical outlets and USB chargers: 3 plugs and 2 USB chargers on the desk, and on the nightstand each bed had 2 plugs and one 1 USB charger. The breakfast is probably below average by Hampton Inn standards, with only two hot items: one egg (either scrambled or omelette) and one meat (rotates between bacon, Canadian bacon, sausage links and a polish Kielbasa-type sausage). That doesn't include the pot of oatmeal and three make-your-own waffle irons. Hotel had a lot of nice small touches: ice water, hot water, coffee and tea available throughout the day in the reception; fresh baked cookies available early evening; free bottled water at check-in; etc. The three elevators were slow and overwhelmed by hotel guests at peak times. At those times, one could wait a long time for an elevator.On the main hotel page they boast ""32nd floor rooftop observation deck"" and ""Venture to our rooftop observation deck on the 32nd floor for panoramic views of Times Square."" This is marketing baloney and the views are mediocre at best. 32 floors is not tall by Times Square standards, and the majority of the view is blocked by the nearby taller buildings.

Customer service & hospitality were the best I’ve ever experienced - at any hotel! We received a text before check in welcoming us and offering help if we needed it. We replied asking if we could bring our bags before check in and they were happy to help! (We did so at checkout too!) We also tried purchasing from their kiosk and instead they recommended the store around the corner to save us money - you could tell the customer and not the bottom line came first! Ever staff member was welcoming, hospitable and wore a smile. You can tell they are true professionals! I love that Hampton Inn includes hot breakfast - the selection is wonderful, even if the buffet line and dining room are rather crowded at this location. The elevators, likewise, can be crowded and run slow during peak times. We received a pro tip from the front desk to take a lower level room and were glad we did! It wouldn’t work for everyone, but we loved taking the stairs to save time. A picky person might have complained that the room was small and had a big dip in the floor, but honestly it was super clean, comfortable, and in the heart of NYC! We didn’t mind. The location was a huge plus - it was central to most of our plans and we frequently chose to walk instead of taking the subway or a car just because everything felt so close! It was easy to pop in and out of the hotel between events (think changing for dinner, or dropping off souvenirs) because of the location.

After each fire alarm, there began a LOUD vacuum-type noise outside of our room for a long time - must have been some kind of ventilation system, so again we had another disruption. Also on our last night, our AC unit started rattling like crazy during the night, so between that and the alarm, it was not restful. Additionally, I would NOT recommend staying here if you are staying with someone you aren't 100% comfortable with. The bathroom doors were barn-door style, with HUGE gaps on either side of the door. You could hear EVERYTHING - honestly the door could have just not been there and it wouldn't have made a difference. Furthermore, there were 30 floors and only 3 elevators. It was such a long wait time in the lobby to go up, and also on your floor to come down. Thank God we were on the 3rd floor - we just started taking the stairs up and down. Overall disappointed. At least it was a clean hotel with a good location, but we are staying somewhere else on our next visit.","Chicago, Illinois","Amanda H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Chicago, Illinois</strong>",3,3.0

It is so easy to get around everywhere. The hotel has a very welcoming lobby and every person that worked there that I spoke with was nothing but nice and helpful. I thought the rooms were really nice too. The breakfast in the morning was plentiful and although it could be a little crowded, there was never that long of a wait to get to what you wanted to. That being said we had three issues with the housekeeping. It was our only area of concern. The first one - my husband left about 3 spoonfuls of yogurt in a container in the room to be thrown away. He didn't want to place it in the garbage can because there was no liner. When we got back to the room after a long day of visiting NYC I sat on the bed and saw a strange sight on the wall next to the bed. There were splatters of the yogurt all over the wall and the picture on the wall too. We went down to tell the front desk - and we were on the way out again - and they sent someone up to clean it. Well, we come back at night - starting to get ready for bed and I find yogurt on my nightshirt! And of course, it was the only one I brought and it was late at night - well you get the picture. I wasn't too happy and was wondering where else the yogurt could have gone. The second occurrence was when my husband came to the room in the afternoon to do some work the next day and the room wasn't made up. He requested that they make up the room and went downstairs to work. An hour and a half later it still wasn't done. The third thing was on our last night. When we got back to the room, the room was cleaned but the cleaning person left their black vinyl cleaning gloves on the dresser. Soooo - if it wasn't for these blunders I would have given this hotel a much higher rating. Also, the elevators are slow so if you are an impatient person you should get a room on a lower floor.","Long Grove, Illinois","973sheryls</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Long Grove, Illinois</strong>",2,4.0

But if it's morning and you're on the top floor, it takes a good 10 minutes to get down because you're stopping on every floor. Then the people on the lower floors can't get in because they are packed. I advise the hotel to have one elevator devoted to the top half, one to the bottom half and one serving all floors.

When selecting the hotel, I initially chose it because of it proximity to Times Square, It is literally 2 blocks away. When researching I read reviews and most were very positive. We drove into the city from Boston and while this was my first experience driving in New York City, the hotel was pretty easy to navigate to. Upon check in, we were met by Luis, one of the Hotel's staff. He took care of our car and gave us a lot of helpful information on where to go and how to get around. We mentioned it was our 30th anniversary and to our surprise after returning from a days adventure, there was a bottle of wine, some goodies and a card signed by the staff members. This really made our day. The hotel was very clean and the lobby was always alive with people. The concierge helped us with show information. We were able to walk from the hotel to Times Square, the Empire State Building, Central Park. The only time we needed transportation was to Battery Park and One World and again the hotel was located a block from the Port Authority Bus Terminal where we could catch the train to One World. Our room on the 29th floor while small was very well laid out which can't be said of other hotels we stayed at during this trip. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Breakfast was provided and we enjoyed it everyday. Each day the hot items were a little different but they always had the waffles.

First, the staff. They were wonderful--friendly and helpful--including at the desk, in the breakfast room and the room attendants. The breakfast included in the room rate was very good and served until 10:00 am, which was nice for late night lifers. Every morning there were different offerings and the selection was quite wide. My only complaint was that sometimes there were not enough tables to seat all who were queued up, but with patience, even this problem resolved fairly quickly. That's the good, and nothing really bad, BUT be prepared for very small rooms. Ours just contained a king bed, a console with a desk and bureau, a desk chair and a padded stool. We were there with our family, and my daughter's room was somewhat larger with a small fridge and second seating bench. Still nothing to write home about regarding space. Like most hotels there was only one luggage rack. I will never understand why hotels don't provide two racks for a ""double"" room. Finally, the hotel is quite close to Times Square, but far enough away to avoid the dreadful press of humanity, and close to many of the theaters which for us was great because we were doing a theater orgy! We used points to get the room and I note on the TripAdvisor website the rate is $359 without tax. One might do better away from Times Square and using Uber or Lyft to get around.","Richmond, Virginia","William S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond, Virginia</strong>",5,3.0

The all-day free coffee, tea & water provides a nice touch to the overall experience & the hotel staff diligently refills the supply. Our party of 3 stayed in a relatively comfortable room which was spacious & well-equipped. The only complaint was that housekeeping forgot to clean our room on the 1st night, I suspect that they may have been overwhelmed. This was mentioned to the front desk & minutes later, housekeeping turned up to clean the room. Fast response. The best thing about the hotel is the location, 2 blocks from centre of Times Square yet located on quiet W 41st. Food choices are plentiful with Hell's Kitchen a few blocks away, entrance to the subway is less than 100m away too. We took about 20 minutes to walk to the southwest entrance of Central Park.

Our room was clean and comfortable and had plenty towels in the bathroom; however, because this IS New York, the room wasn't very big. What I loved most about my room was the PILLOWS!! I have stayed in quite a few Hampton Inns and have always complained that the pillows were too soft. Well these were on point. They were firm enough to support my neck while I slept, but not so hard that I felt like I was on a brick. Thank You SOOOO MUCH for that. The area where the free breakfast was served was crowded when I went down on Friday, but the food was hot and very tasty, which was the most important thing. I LOVED the fresh-out-the-oven chocolate chip cookies located at the front desk each evening, and the fact that the front desk staff gave me a bottle of water whenever I asked .

Not amazing -but comfortable.Bath - it was probably renovated not so long ago - but water pressure is low and it takes to much time for the hot water to come - at least in the upper floors. And last but not least- the breakfast- absolutely awful. Very little healthy options, no greens, very little fruits. The dining room is packed so people actually take their breakfast (paper plates..) to the hotel lobby. I decided to step outside to a cafe and by myself a descent breakfast. I also want to mention the elevator issue: there are 3 elevators in the hotel - and the algorithm for those is terrible so as a resident in the high floors you would be stopped in at least 6-7 floors before getting to the lobby. People are waiting so much time for the elevator they wouldn't miss the one that came for the world- so they get in. No meter what. By the time you get to the lobby - the elevator is packed that badly that you need a breath of fresh air before thinking about anything else. There's also a road work in the street currently (may 2018) so ask for a room in the higher floors and to the opposite direction from the 41st. street.One advantage to finish nicely: location is great if you are into the whole times square vibe. A 2 minute walk to the subway and Broadway.and also- front desk service is good - I got an awful room at the 4th floor and asked to move to a different room.

She's been asking for years for a trip to NYC. Since it was going to be just mom/daughter trip I was a little apprehensive about being in the ""big city"" on our own (we are from small town MS). From the minute we walked in the door we felt welcome and safe. Front desk offered us water, told us when and where breakfast was served, told us about the rooftop observation area. There was an unexpected snow while there, staff told me several places I could go to get boots. This hotel is in a safe area close to Times Square and lots and lots of places to eat. We were greeted warmly every time we returned. Breakfast was good and plentiful, but seating was limited. We made plates and took them back to our room to eat. There is a microwave by the desk in the lobby along with a little area that offers sundries, drinks. Snacks, ice cream, beer, frozen pizzas, popcorn etc for any late night cravings and you can just charge it to your room. The room was very very small. 2 beds. We got the city view and could see the top of the Empire State Building. Our room was also not cleaned one day. We ended up going down and getting towels. We were not in the room very much so I'm not sure why we didn't get the service that one day. On the day of check out, a young man took our bags and even hauled a taxi for us to get back to Penn station. Overall, we had an amazing trip. In a great, friendly hotel.

For this reason, I requested a lower floor so that I could use the stairs to go to and from the room. I'm glad that I did. What I was disappointed with this visit was the housekeeping. We were there for four nights, and left the room very early each morning, and were out and about for the majority of the day. Despite this, we had to request housekeeping service late in the afternoon (3-4 ish) the first couple of days so that we could take showers and clean up before going out in the evening.

For ease, I have divided my review into sections.LocationThe location for NYC could not be better. It is a two minute walk from the hotel to Times Square, Broadway and a subway station. The hotel itself is on a 'quieter' (for NYC!) street but minutes in either direction offer a host of restaurants and places to buy snacks, as well as the key attractions such as theatres. I found that I could walk to many of the key sites from the hotel without any problems.Hotel facilitiesCheck in was quick, easy and friendly and staff were always on hand to help with questions or concerns. The lobby area is spacious with seating which is useful if waiting for taxis etc. There is also water and hot drinks available here which is a nice touch.The hotel is large with 31 floors and is serviced by three elevators. These were honestly the most irritating part of the stay - they seemed to have a mind of their own when it came to stopping for you when called, they were constantly packed at busy times and the keycard swipe system to select your floor was irritating. My advice would be to ask for a low floor and take the stairs at peak times!The roomMy room was large enough for me and easily big enough for two people. The bed was huge, very comfortable and the pillows were some of the most comfortable I have ever encountered in a hotel. A spacious wardrobe and drawers meant plenty of room for all my stuff. The bathroom was also large with a shower. The room had all the basics - toiletries, air conditioning and a coffee machine. My only complaint was while the coffee machine was great, powdered creamer was provided which wasn't to my taste.BreakfastBreakfast was provided during my stay. I chose this option because while I knew NYC offered hundreds of breakfast options I knew it would be good for me to be able to grab something before heading out for the day. The breakfast options were varied, offering cereal, pastries, yogurt and fruit as well as a few limited hot options including mini omelettes and 'make your own' waffles. I had breakfast several times during my stay and found the food options varied and of a good quality. I would recommend every Brit try Fruit Loops if you have never done so before! However... The area for breakfast was relatively small compared to the size of the hotel and it was often incredibly busy so there was nowhere to sit. This was frustrating at times. Also, all of the plates and cutlery was disposable paper and plastic which I felt was a complete waste and not very eco-friendly, as well as being irritating when on one occasion my plastic cup leaked everywhere!Value for moneyWhen looking at hotels for NYC, I noticed some included the city tax whereas some charged this as an additional extra on arrival. I chose Hampton Inn because it was an all included price. I think for the standard of the room and the superb location it was definitely good value for money.","Norwich, United Kingdom","Elsie2110</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Norwich, United Kingdom</strong>",49,4.0

Bathroom has 1 small sink and a shower The rooms only had 2 double beds which I was aware of, but no sitting area for tv and barely any clothes storage space. When we were tired of going sight seeing and walking Times Square the only place we could sit and relax was up in our room on our beds to watch Tv. . Most of the rooms were right next to the elevators. They had a decent free breakfast. Sometimes it got very crowded but that is to be expected. Again the staff was very helpful. Put us in a bigger room than we started out with but it was still really too small for 4 people.The staff did what they could with what they had. I think it is a good hotel to stay in for a quick stop for a couple of days but next time I think I will book a hotel that is more resort like, that has a restaurant and a lobby to kick back in . I picked the Hampton for a better price which included breakfast but we could've stayed in a more comfortable place without breakfast included for just a little more money.

I was very nervous and honestly a little (okay, a LOT) intimidated by New Yorkers. I was expecting rude people and judgement. I couldn't have been more wrong!! Our first contact was with a very nice man, Luis, that helped us out of our cab and even took our bags in for us. Then we went to the check in desk and the man checking us in was probably the NICEST person I have ever met! His name was Kris, and he was absolutely wonderful. We told him we were seeing Aladdin, and he gave us a tip that if you walk straight through the McDonald's across the street, the theater is right next door. That's another thing, this hotel is in the PERFECT location. It's right in the heart of Times Square without being on a main street, and it's about a 2 minute (if that) walk from the hotel to the New Amsterdam theater and Madame Tussaud's. And believe me, I am not a fast walker. When we checked out, we tentatively asked if they could hold our bags after we did so we could go to Madame Tussaud's, and they were more than happy to do it! When we left, Luis carried our bags out and even waved down a cab for us while dancing in the street to Michael Bublé (He's a great dancer). I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The elevators can get crowded quickly during busy times, but if you're patient enough you'll get one that isn't. The breakfast was a little disappointing, but all in all this hotel was great. I would absolutely stay here again!!!","Boston, Massachusetts","SallyJenkins1989</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",4,5.0

As I looked to book at a previous hotel I saw the reviews for Hampton Inn to match that of other very popular hotels. After looking at the reviews and looking at pictures we decided to book. And I have to say WOW!!! I loved it.. everything from the hotel texting me about my check in to the front desk being sooo friendly and approachable. The gentlemen Jeremy check us in with a beautiful smile. Explained everything!

Bed was comftable (didn’t wake up one)Breakfast was great, love how you can make your own Waffles which led me to discover how great I am at making them :-)But the one of the main reasons I like the hotel is he fact that they can watch your bags while you explore the city even AFTER you check out!!! We took full advantage. After eating breakfast at 9am we went shopping and came back at 11am, checked out and told valet to get our car since you should request it 30-45 min before leaving. And we went to grab a quick bite and some gifts for the kids.We came back 45 min later and our car was ready to go and once we came back to the hotel found out that our bags were already in the car!! I will write that again... OUR bags were already on the car.. ready to go!!! Seriously how convenient... I didn’t get the gentleman’s name. He had amazing long hair do :-)We really enjoyed our stay and I am currently looking into booking to come back with the kids in June.

I usually stay at a Hilton family property but also have a few boutique hotels I love. This was my first stay at this Hampton Inn and it is by far my best and most pleasant stay in the city ever. I arrived at 7:30am prepared to leave my bags with the bellman but Kris at registration was able to get me in to a room right away. He was so friendly and welcoming so after my 3am wake up call for the flight in to NYC, I was grateful for the smiles and the room being ready. Besides the great welcome, what I noticed immediately was the feel in the lobby. It is bright, open, and arranged in such a way that it did not have that crowded NYC lobby feel. The breakfast room did get crowded but it was easy enough to move out in to the lobby where I always saw empty seats. The second thing I was over joyed with was the speed of the elevators. I was on the 23rd floor and I never had to wait long. By the way, on my first entry to the elevator, a very helpful employee, Tobo, was quick to hold the door open and explain the process of using the card. (I think it was Tobo, may have been Jonny, either way - at various times they were BOTH incredibly helpful.) Okay, on to the room. The hallway from elevator to room was wide, bright, and clean. The room was big by NY standards and the view of the city amazing. The bathroom likewise was big and laid out in a very user friendly way. The shower was the largest I have ever had in the city and the water pressure amazing. (I was a little sad when I returned home missing that strong spray.) There was always plenty of hot water too, which can sometimes be an issue in a large hotel. I read other reviews about the outlet not being near the desk... in my room it was true that the outlet was on the wall to the left and not right under the desk but my power cord reached it with room to spare. No problem there at all. The bed was comfy of course, it's a Hilton. Plenty of hangers in the closet, all the other amenities I need in a room were there. The location for me was perfect; a five block walk to my work and just a little farther to my favorite restaurants. It was heavenly to leave and return to this hotel each day without being jostled by hoards of tourists and be so warmly received. As long as the price stays within my budget, this will be my go to hotel for all of my stays.

Prices were very high (mid $300s, as I recall) for the night we needed, so I traded in a bunch of credit card points for a free night here. The location was just about perfect. It was a quick walk up from Penn Station, just 8 short blocks, and the hotel signage was easy to spot from all the way down at 8th Avenue (the hotel is about 200 ft off 7th Ave.).We were warmly welcomed and expertly checked in by the thoroughly professional Rachelle. That check-in experience is so important in establishing trust in the hospitality experience, and she aced it! Even though it's a big-city hotel, the lobby space felt reachable and knowable: there was a business center behind and to the left of the front desk, a 24-hr coffee/tea station just in front and to the left of the front desk, a sitting area with comfortable couches and a big TV screen opposite the front desk, a booking agent just to the left of that (for tours and Broadway tickets), and to the right, a large table with plenty of seats and power ports for laptop and tablet users. The breakfast area was set off just to the left beyond the elevators. I mean, it was all right there, making even a one-night stay easily navigable and very comfortable.The hotel was filled with all kinds of folks: families, both domestic and international; business travelers, both solo and in groups; lots of 20- and 30-somethings on city breaks; and retirees like us just doing their thing. And language galore! People everywhere seemed to be in a good mood, which I think says a lot about the hotel.The room was comfortable. It was one of the recent remodels among Hampton Inns, with the large, sliding door to the bathroom, with entry directly from the bedroom rather than the entry hallway. Everything was fresh and clean, with bathroom and coffee station supplies fully stocked and everything in perfect working order. Beds and bedding comfortable.Breakfast was equally well run, and fully stocked with just about every option in the Hampton Inn ""menu."" There is a sign in the lobby alerting guests to the typical quiet and busy hours in the breakfast room, which is great for setting expectations and allowing guests to plan accordingly--much better than the surprise about crowds when you're in a rush, and another sign that management is keyed in to customer satisfaction.That's enough. Don't want to give them big heads! Oh, soundproofing in the room was excellent!","Clifton Park, New York","Joel F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Clifton Park, New York</strong>",43,5.0

Most cabs were full nearby so couldn't catch one. Alternatives are Uber - they are all around but very high priced or take subway/bus if you dare.Ugly- Construction on streets happen AT NIGHT with no curfew and stops right before rush hour in morning so if you can sleep through that, then go for it. Times Square area is loud in general but if construction nearby (like when I stayed), you will hear it loud and all night long.","Dallas, Texas","0beachbum0</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dallas, Texas</strong>",64,4.0

We went to the breakfast buffet at 6:00 every morning so we could start exploring the city early. It was getting busy even at that time, but I love the fact that they provide trays for you to take the food back to your room. It's a typical Hampton Inn buffet breakfast - no better and no worse than others. If you want a sit-down breakfast with real plates and silver ware, than you should probably stay somewhere else.

The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of offerings and staff who worked in the dining room were quite pleasant.The bedroom and bathroom were good sizes (not tiny like a lot of hotels in the mid town area)My only quip about this hotel was the wait time for the elevators, which other guests had also mentioned. There are 3 elevators but they don’t seem adequate to handle the amount of guests that the facility caters, to particularly at busy times (e.g. towards the end of the time allocated for the breakfast buffet). The elevators would fill up at the higher floors leaving the people on the lower floors stuck waiting and waiting for an empty car to arrive.

We wanted a hotel that would be close to the theater district for the three days that we were in town for a girls trip. But would make this even more attractive was the subway stop which is just down the block and the port Authority bus terminal. By far the easiest way to get from your hotel to JFK is to walk maybe a quarter of a mile to the port Authority bus terminal you can actually see it from the hotel. Hop on an NYC AirPorter it’ll take you direct to either LaGuardia or JFK airport. And it will drop you off your specific terminals. Wish I had known this on the way in.I’ve stayed at more luxurious hotels but this hotel was clean safe friendly and everything you could possibly need. Including comfy beds.

No question, the location was wonderful...one block from the heart of Times Square. Now, one thing to keep in mind, NYC hotels are notoriously small, which we were expecting. The Hampton Inn room was clean but small. The double beds were only full sized, so with two adults and two teenagers, it was a tight squeeze. No refrigerator. The elevator system was an exercise in patience. Because a lot of people were traveling on these very small elevators, and if you had a room on one of the mid to lower floors and wanted to go to the ground floor...good luck. The elevators filled up quickly. Likewise, going up was difficult as well. In order to go up, you have to swipe your room key on the interior panel, then push a button. Imagine 20 people having to crowd one side of the elevator in order to go up to their rooms. On to valet service. Our car was parked across the street. It took AN HOUR for valet service to get our car when we checked out. Even the desk clerks were getting annoyed with the delay by valet staff. First time we did not tip valet service...ever. We were given a discount on our bill because of the delay.","Rockville, Maryland","ShawnM299</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rockville, Maryland</strong>",19,3.0

I was a bit hesitant as I can be difficult to please when it comes to cleanliness (yes, I've been known to change hotels or purchase Clorox wipes and Lysol upon arrival and use them). We had a late flight and did not arrive at the hotel until after midnight. No problem. The front desk clerk was very welcoming and efficient. We were in our room within 15 minutes of arriving. Not only was our room ready, the location was perfect for us. Our window faced another building on a quiet street. Remember this is NYC- the city that never sleeps! We heard the occasional siren but nothing extreme. Considering its proximity to TS, I expected more noise. Thankfully, that was not the case. We opted for a room with a king bed and were not disappointed. Our 16th floor room was efficient, but nicely appointed considering that we were not in a 5 star hotel. If you are looking for luxury be prepared to pay for it and look along the Upper East Side/Central Park area. If you prefer a clean, nicely appointed, efficient space, serviced by hospitable, helpful employees, then this hotel should fit the bill perfectly. There are only 2 of us, so we did not have the same considerations as those traveling with children. We maneuvered the space with no problems. I suspect those that travel internationally or spend a lot of time in NYC will be more familiar with hotel room sq footage. It worked fine for us. As others have mentioned, during our stay the elevators were at capacity during the normal meal/arrival/departure hours. We did make the 15 flight trek downstairs a time or two in order to get to breakfast because we did not want to spend time waiting for the elevator. The breakfast options were standard for Hampton Inn and were replenished often. The breakfast crew was hard at work on the mornings we chose to eat breakfast at the hotel. They were also very kind when approached by guests making requests for specific items. We enjoyed hearing various languages (mostly European) at breakfast. The concierge was quite helpful when asked about area restaurants and made some ""off the beaten path"" suggestions that were appreciated. We thought the location was perfect for accessing the subway or walking to area attractions. The front desk also took care of hiring a car for our red eye departure on the last morning of our trip. The driver arrived a bit early and dropped us off at the airport without incident. If you are flying in/out of LGA, be aware of construction.

Very close to Times Square, Macy's, Madison Square Gardens and a lot of the main attractions. We used the Hop On Hop Off buses to get out bearings and then walked from the hotel to the Rockfeller Center, Empire State, Grand Central Station. Public Library and 5th Avenue shops. We also walked to see Anastasia at the Broadhurst Theatre three blocks away.The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable. They weren't large rooms with only a single wardrobe, one bedside cabinet between the two double beds and one three drawer chest of drawers but there was enough room to put two large suitcases down on the floor. There was a large keypad operated safe in the wardrobe that would have been big enough to get a laptop in plus additional items. All the usual things in the room - hairdryer, coffee making facilities, shampoo, shower gel, tv with lots of channels, iron and board. Free WiFi which we found served all four of us well. Three lifts serving the 31 floors so at times there was a wait but never particularly long I felt. You needed your key to get it to go up which was reassuring. Credit card was asked for on check in but nothing untoward appeared on it and local phone calls were free. Reception staff were helpful and looked after our cases as we had to check out earlier than our pick up from the airport. Coffee, tea and water were available in the lobby as were warm cookies on occasion. There was also a range of groceries and medicines that you could pay for at reception but you should note there is no bar here although there are plenty of places to eat and drink in the area e.g. turn left out of the front door to find Schnippers a good burger place only a couple of minutes away. There was a good choice of items for breakfast all served with disposable tableware which we had expected and were fine with. Cereals, oatmeal, muffins, toast, bagels, fruit, yogurts, fruit juice, coffee and tea plus make-your-own-waffles were supplemented each day with a different variety of eggs and sausage or bacon. We never had a problem finding a table for the four of us but the hotel has a poster advertising the busiest breakfast times in the lobby which I have added to this review.

We were on our honey moon. However, the failed to register the name of my wife at check-in, which caused that, in our SIXTH night at the hotel, when I was visiting a friend without my wife and had no cell phone signal or internet available because I live in another and my carrier doesn’t cover the U.S, they DID NOT LET MY WIFE IN!! She had her key but it stopped working, and she presented it at the front desk to a lady and a man that treated her VERY badly. My wife had been walking all day, she was tired and needed a bathroom. The people at the front desk had seen us all week, we had talked to them many times, we laghed together and they even helped us with pictures and cookies and other stuff the previous nights, and they pretended they had never seen her and told her that I had to call them to tell them she is my wife to let her in, because it is not costumary in our country that women take the husband’s last name, so our last names are different. For me this is unacceptable behavior. They had her stay at the lobby for about an hour, when luckily I was able to get in a wifi connection and saw all the messages she had sent me. I had to ask my friend for a phone and call the hotel just to literally say “she is my wife”. It is supposed to be a security measure but they didn’t ask me for personal data or any data that could tell them it was me calling... do you see the irony? It could’ve been anyone that she asked to call and say “she is my wife”. The man on duty, an almost bald guy, was the SAME guy the checked us in!! I could’ve understand if this happened the first nights, but we had many interactions with these people before this event occurred. A black spot on what was a fantastic trip courtesy of the people at the front desk.","San Jose, Costa Rica","Jose Pablo M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, Costa Rica</strong>",1,3.0

We also loved the sunset as we faced west, and could even see the Hudson in the distance.

Our room was very clean and service at all levels excellent, from the cleaning staff to the breakfast room to the front desk. They bend over backwards to help make your stay comfortable.

In fact, if not for the amazing staff, we probably would have switched hotels. The location is good for most people - very near to the 42nd street metro station, though it felt quite a ways ""off"" Times Square if you are looking for a central to Times Square location- it is nowhere near the DoubleTree or Marriott Marquis or the TKTS booth, for example. But it was just a short walk to the theaters we needed to go to and Bryant Park is just three blocks away, and the Port Authority hub is quite close. It's also close to a bunch of restaurants as well as Starbucks, CVS, Joe's Pizza and Whole Foods, so we found it convenient overall location-wise. And it's a ten minute walk or so (13 blocks) to Rockefeller Center, so not too bad. The rooms are small (as are the rooms in many NY hotels, but these felt smaller) and the hallways are super small/narrow. There are three elevators, so you don't have to wait too long if it's not a busy time of day. ice is on every other floor, so you have to walk up and down stairs to get ice. there was no refrigerator in the room (or microwave) so that really cut down on convenience (there's a microwave downstairs though). The beds are quite comfy but the shower is basically useless -so little water comes out that it takes quite awhile to actually shower! The heater and A/C worked well and the view from the upper floors was very good. Security is also quite good at this hotel and the area is nice, so you don't feel unsafe. There's plenty of homeless people you have to walk by to get to the hotel, but that's also quite normal for the area.... We tried the breakfast and found it pretty basic and not at all really appetizing, so we just walked outside and got food elsewhere each day. There is coffee/tea/water and hot chocolate in the lobby all the time and cookies in the afternoon - so that was really great. And the lobby is quite nice - easy to sit in and read or do work. I would recommend it to those who don't mind staying just a tad ""off"" the main drag and who are like the Hilton brand (there's another Hilton literally across the street!) and who don't mind small rooms with minimal amenities in them.",,867jacquil,0,4.0

The motel requires that the room key be used on a key reader while selecting the floor in the lift. No employee told me this. I found out from another guest when I asked him to press ""7"". Using the key reader is not easy when one has the key in one hand, a cane in the other, and a bag hanging off the shoulder. Kudos for making the premises safer with this feature, but aren't you supposed to tell guests about it and help people with it if they are using a cane and a knee brace and have two bags.

The location can't be beat. It's in the Times Square and Broadway area, but just a couple blocks away so the lights and noise were not an issue. What made this hotel stand out was the front desk customer service. My sister in law dropped us off around 1:30. I had gone in with my kids to ask if we could store our luggage before check in at 3:00. Gentleman at the front desk said they could, but to cross my fingers and he might be able to do better than that. Sure enough, he checked and our room was ready. What a relief after getting up at 3:45 AM and flying half way across the country, to be able to check in and lie down for a few minutes before starting to explore the area. Everyone at the front desk had a smile and was very helpful. The room was bigger than expected. It was actually larger than the Hampton Inn in Joplin, MO where we have also stayed. In Missouri my girls and I could barely move around, in NYC we had space. I'd seen comment on Trip Advisor about the rooms being small, so I was pleasantly surprised. I heard much less noise than I expected from NYC so that was also awesome. Morning of checkout, I asked if I could store my luggage since our train didn't leave until 2:40 PM. I thought since we were done, they might want to flip the room for the next customer. The gentleman at the front desk said to stay until checkout, then Luis would be able to store the luggage. After returning and checking out, we stored the luggage then went back out. Luis offered to get us a cab when we collected our luggage, and when the cab drivers refused to take us on a short ride, he personally took us to the cab line at 8th Ave, telling us they could not refuse us a ride there. What a great help! With a heavy suitcase, the fact he took the extra time, was over and beyond. I just wish I could remember to the names of the two people that worked with me at the front desk. So, if a manager reads this, the front desk on November 9th and 10th were awesome.

Due to the central location, even when we cabbed it somewhere it was inexpensive. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. The last day we were there it was raining and the front desk staff loaned me an umbrella for the evening. Price was a bit higher than I’m used to for a Hampton Inn but it was reasonable for the location. Will definitely stay here again.

I asked the front desk about availability and the only room available was a double bed room for 400+dollars. I asked about the hilton weekend offer online for buy 2 nights get 1 half off, and the lady at the front desk simply told me i could call the hilton main number to ask them.

From there we walked the approx 2 blocks to the hotel. From the hotel to Times Square is about 3 blocks. Wolfgang's restaurant is 200 feet from the hotel with great food & service but a bit pricey. The second night we ate at Jack's at 140 West 40th Street which is 1 1/2 blocks from the hotel. The food & service were equal to Wolfgang's but price was more economical. On a future trip wed eat only at Jack's. The included breakfast at the hotel was excellent. The staff were flying, keeping the buffet topped up, tables cleaned and garbage pails emptied.

We had the best time and the hotel was the PERFECT location. We arrived at about 12:30 in the afternoon, I had contacted the hotel beforehand to see if we could check in early due to having a long day of travelling, they stated that they could not guarantee it, however we were able to check in as soon as we arrived. We had booked a room with two double beds and we were not expecting much due to previous reviews. We staying in room 612 and there wasn’t much of a view but you go out for that anyway. The room was more than adequate, the beds were super comfortable. They were plenty of places to charge devices, including USB ports only which were ideal if you forget your plugs. There was a TV with a wide array of channels. A writing desk and chair. A separate chair and a full length mirror. There was also a closet which contained a safe which was free of charge to use and an iron and ironing board. The only downside would be that it was difficult to store cases in the room but we put them down the side of the bed and didn’t have a problem.The bathroom was great. It contained a bath with an overhead shower, a toilet, a sink with lots of storage space and a mirror with a light behind it which was great to get your make up done. House keeping were great as well, very friendly and attentive to the room. It was like stepping into a new hotel room every time you came back to your room. The beds were always made, the bins were emptied, toiletries were restocked and a general tidy was completed every day. The breakfast was great as well. Yes, it is somewhat basic but it’s included in the price. It stops you having to go out into the city and eat before you start the day. What more can you ask for. There were always two hot breakfast items on everyday which varied in contents. Some days there would be omelettes and maple sausages, other days there would be sausage patties. There was always waffles, toast, bagels, cereals, fruits, hard boiled eggs and yogurt available. There was also an endless supply of tea, coffee, water and fruit juices. There was something there for even the fussiest of eaters. It was a great way to start the day. There was also the option of a grab and go breakfast which contained a cereal bar, a bottle of water and a piece of fruit. We never used it but we thought it was a nice touch. At times the breakfast room can be busy but it’s to be expected when breakfast is complimentary for each and every guest staying in the hotel. We didn’t ever have an issue finding somewhere to sit down and eat. We would arrive between 8am - 9am. The lifts I have seen are a draw back for some guests, yes at times you have to wait a while because there are only 3 lifts. But again if you are finding criticism in hotel of this size because you have to wait a while for a lift then you’ve obviously got no patience whatsoever. The lobby was light, bright and colourful. It was a very welcoming and comfortable place to be. There was always complimentary tea, coffee and water available so you can just grab and go. At around 5pm they would put cookies out for the guests. Some guests would be really greedy and take way more than they needed, so get in there fast if you want a free cookie. The staff we’re very friendly and accommodating. There is also a food pantry within the lobby containing toiletries, drinks and snacks which is open 24 hours.The WiFi worked great, we didn’t upgrade and stuck to the free one. It worked well, I was able to upload, download and stream films without any issues. One downside would be having to log in every 24 hours to gain the WiFi but it took a matter of seconds to do. The location was literally perfect - you are down the road from Times Square and I mean that literally. You are close enough that you are a stones throw away without all the noise and hustle bustle constantly. You can walk to most major attractions as well which can help to save money and the hop on hop off bus is based around the corner as well and to the right. There are numerous subway stops close by as well. There are plenty of places to eat, drink, party, shop, buy snacks and there are endless photo opportunities. Would I return to this hotel? Yes, in a heartbeat!!! ","Staffordshire, United Kingdom","rachelanne12345</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Staffordshire, United Kingdom</strong>",262,5.0

If you happen to forget anything such as toiletries, comb, toothbrush, shaving foam etc the hotel will provide it complimentary for you, really, they cant do enough for you. We felt totally confident leaving our personal items in our room. The room was cleaned to a high spec every day, you can choose if you would like fresh towels or to re-use them. The hotel provides free tea, coffee & chilled water 24hrs a day, which is most appreciated when you've been out walking all day. My only slight criticism would be that at peak times for breakfast you probably wont get a table, we found 6.30-7.30 you could get a table but any later is a struggle, although on the plus side they provide a grab bag if you're not planning to stay for breakfast.Our flight home wasn't until 9.30pm, check out was 12pm. The hotel happily stowed our luggage (securely in a separate room where they where tagged & we were given a receipt) Lewis at reception couldnt have been more helpful, he ordered us a Lincoln town car to take us to the airport which arrived on time, he also provided us with bottles of water & brownies to take away with us, which came in very handy!!I would highly recommend a stay at this very comfortable & clean hotel if you are planning a visit to Times square.

The hotel is a few blocks from central Times Square, less than a block to the subway station with access to most trains and within walking distance to most Broadway Theaters and a variety of restaurants and shopping. When we checked in as Elite members of Hilton, we were given complimentary bottled water and a snack. The key card is needed to go up to your floor but not to come down. However in the morning from about 8:30 am until about 10:00 am the ""UP"" elevator buttons do not function and it can be very busy trying to get an elevator going down especially if you are on a lower floor. It took us several tries to finally get a down elevator at 9:00 am in the morning.They serve a complimentary breakfast every morning from 6:30 am - 10:00 am (suggested timing 6-7 no waiting; 7:30-8:30 short lines and some delays; 8:30-10:00 heavier traffic with delays and waits for tables). The breakfast consists of some type of egg each morning and sausage or bacon, self serve waffles, oatmeal, fresh fruit, hard boiled eggs, toast, bagels, muffins, dry cereal, yogurt, milk, coffee, tea, juices. If you don't have time for breakfast, during the week, they provide a breakfast bag at the from desk that has a piece of fresh fruit, a muffin or breakfast bar and water that you can pick up on your way out of the hotel. There are 3 computer terminals and 1 printer that are in the ""business center"" of to the left of the front desk. You can get the password at the front desk. There is coffee, tea and water 24 hours a day just to the left of the front desk. There is a fitness center in the lower level (you need your key to get to the basement as well as to get in the fitness center. There are 4 treadmills, 2 Ellipticals, 2 bikes (1 upright, 1 recumbent), a weight bench, free weights, a weight machine, water, towels and headsets for the televisions. Bathrooms are outside the fitness room. There is also a guest laundry in the basement with washers and dryers ($2.00 per machine) but no change machines. The washers and dryers use quarters only, no credit cards. You can buy detergent from the pantry next to the front desk. The pantry also has sundries, snacks, beverages and frozen meals. There is a microwave in the pantry to heat up your meals.The rooms are average size with either a king or two queens. Our room was updated and had a walk-in shower, no bath tub. They only leave two sets of towels so if you need more be sure to ask the night before. There are plenty of outlets around the room and by the bedside as well as dedicated USB outlets. There is an iron and ironing board in the closet. In the evening they put out warm cookies for a snack at the front desk. The wi-fi is free but you have to log-in every 24 hours.The front desk staff are very friendly and helpful and the concierge service is very good. We used the services of both ""Cool Maureen"" and John and found both to be very knowledgable, helpful and patient. We took a cab in from the airport (La Guardia) but found out the hotel has a private car service for a flat $55.00 plus tip (up to 4 passengers) or a commuter bus for $21.00 per person with pick-ups at several area hotels. They will also flag a taxi for you in front of the hotel.We were very happy with this hotel and if coming to the Times Square area again, will definite think about staying here again.

They have the usual complimentary breakfast that we've had at every Hampton Inn we've ever stayed at. It is within walking distance of all of the theatre district and subways are close by. The only problem was the elevator situation. They are very small elevators and when we got there, only two of the three were operating. I would recommend staying on an upper floor because the elevator fills up fast, and those on lower floors (10 and under) sometimes had to wait until an elevator would show up with enough space left to get on.

On first arrival, we were greeted by friendly and funny staff. The guy checking us in was really friendly and helpful. We had booked a room with a city view and was given a room on the 29th floor. The room had a great view - you could even see some of the big lit up signs that were near the end of Times Square. The room itself was a decent size, especially for it being NYC. We had two queen size beds that were comfy and clean. The room also had a small desk with a chair and a big screen tv. The television got a lot of tv channels; a lot more than you normally get in a hotel room. The bathroom was a good size with a bathtub type shower. The room had it's own heating and cooling system separate from the hallway. However, we found it hard to regulate the temperature of the room. 68 degrees Fahrenheit was too cold; whereas, 70 degrees was almost too warm. But it wasn't a huge deal. The only real complaint we had about the room was that there wasn't really anywhere to put the suitcases. The way the room was set up it was hard to put your suitcase down without blocking a door. So maybe if there was a way you could put the suitcase under the bed, that would solve that problem. For the hotel itself, we liked that it offered a complimentary breakfast every morning. However, some mornings it was really hard to find a seat. Therefore, come early to beat the rush! Another important thing to note is that they only had three elevators servicing all 31 floors. At times, it took a while to get down or up - stopping at multiple floors.When it comes to the location of the hotel, it was amazing - one of the main reasons we chose this hotel. It was within walking distance to all of the Broadway theatres. We could easily walk to and from all of the shows in a matter of 15 minutes, and that was to the farthest theatre on 51st Street. Times Square was about a two minute walk. The hotel was also located right next to the subway station, so we could take that when going to other points of interest. We only had to take a taxi to and from the airport - it was nice to be able to walk everywhere! Lastly, the hotel had free wifi but you had to keep reconnecting after 24 hours which was kind of annoying. But the wifi was fast for the size of the hotel. With all that said, my dad and I already said that we would stay here again when we come back to the city!",Illinois,"mandanic0le12</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Illinois</strong>",6,4.0

On the positive side, it’s very close to Times Square and the subway. The property has a good appearance and the staff was friendly. The breakfasts were standard Hampton Inn food - not great but not bad. The room size was okay but there isn’t much closet space or bathroom counter space. When we arrived we had four VERY small and flat pillows and asked for additional pillows. We also only had two bath towels. These towels were THE smallest and most worn out towels I have ever seen in a hotel; they should have been tossed a long time ago. We called and asked for more towels as well. It took another call but we eventually got the pillows and towels. I didn’t think it possible, but these towels were even worse than the two we had; the were frayed and literally had holes in them! The handle to the shower/faucet came off in my hand and water was spraying onto the floor. We eventually got it stopped - the handle never was fixed but we learned how to use it. Overall, not a bad place but not great either. It’s clear that this Hampton Inn was not using brand standard towels or bath mats.

Do not, I repeat, do not rent car. The wear and tear on your nerves not to mention the cost to park in down town New York City is ridiculous. Transit is excellent and if you are staying near Times Square you can walk to the majority of the attractions. Taxis are a standard mode of transportation but, be prepared for a bumper to bumper experience and most important of all, be patient! We found everyone to be very courteous and if you have questions, strangers were there to help without hesitation. A word to the wise, befriend the concierge at your hotel. They are an invaluable resource and well worth the tips you give them! Take the Gray Line 'Hop On Hop Off' tours and use the coupons that are an integral part of the package you purchase. Worth every penny. If you like your food and a great atmosphere try Carbone on West 38th St. for Italian and Benjamin Steakhouse Prime on 40th St. for steaks and no trip to NYC would be complete unless you eat at Kats'z Deli. This is where 'Harry Met Sally'. Take the table service option vs. self serve and ask for David to be your waiter. He can insult you and make you laugh at the same time. Most important, the food (Reuben and Pastrami sandwiches) is nothing short of awesome. For a quick lunch on the go, the street vendors offer a great cross section of culinary delights. Quite honestly we were a little nervous about trying this type of eating experience but, when in New York do what the new Yorkers do. Go for the Halal and any vendor that sells the famous New York hot dog. Grays Papaya sells the best hot dogs and don't ask how papaya and hot dogs are related! Stay away from Dallas BBQ on 42nd St. Enough said. A trip to NYC wouldn't be complete without seeing a Broadway show or two and buy your tickets before you go to get the best seats and prices. We saw Come From Away the story of the flights that were forced to land at the town of Gander, Newfoundland on 9/11 and how the 7000+ stranded passengers were hosted by the towns residents. If you are Canadian you will leave the theatre feeling very proud. We also saw School of Rock. Words cannot describe the awesome talent of the young people that perform in this musical. You will be on your feet more than you are in your seat, I can guarantee it. No trip to New York would be complete without visiting the 9/11 ground zero memorial. It is emotional and I will leave it at that. Do not miss Central Park and a horse drawn carriage or pedi-cab ride/tour. The Empire State building and Top of the Rock (Rockefeller Center) are also must see attractions as is the harbor tour where you get up close to the Statue of Liberty. Anything short of a week in the Big Apple in my opinion does not give you enough time to see the major attractions. We stayed at the Hampton Inn on W 41st and our decision to do was based in part on breakfast being included with our room rate and the excellent location of the hotel to Times Square. The concierges (John and Maureen) at the hotel were an invaluable resource and made our stay that much more enjoyable.

From the moment we arrived we were looked after so well. We were quickly booked in and were given all the necessary info from Kevin. Our room was huge and was spotlessly clean. Plenty of towels and toiletries and you could have a bath or shower. The beds were SO comfy. Breakfast was great with plenty choice for all and they do advise of peak times so you cannot complain. Geraldine and Teddy do a fantastic job making sure everybody is well fed and they do cater for any particular needs. The hotel is in an ideal location for any area that you are going to with Times Square only minutes away. The housekeeping staff are so friendly and nothing is a problem. There is an endless supply of tea and coffee in the lobby and the cookies are delicious. When you come back in at night there are plenty bottles of water available. Nothing is a bother for the staff and the concierge staff are so knowledgable. When we checked out the staff arranged transportation to the airport and it was a fabulous, comfortable car. In summary hotel is fabulous and would absolutely recommend to all. As I said to Kevin this morning ""we will be back"". Thanks again. Maria, Stephen and Gillian.

We asked for a larger room and got one slightly bigger but not much on the 25th floor. Housekeeping was not the best as I found hair stuck to the drain in the shower the first night and the room had a stale odor. The curtains didn't do a very good job of keeping the neon lights of Times Square out during the night. The bed was comfortable enough but the pillows flattened too easily. The bathe towels we ent very thick either and some of the towels we got were frayed. Breakfast was the typical Hampton Inn fare that you get at most other Hamptons. The front desk staff were friendly enough and there was a concierge there during the day. There were three computers for guests to use and one printer. The elevators were quick and didn't have to wait too long for one to arrive. You needed your key card for the room to access the elevator to get to your floor.

Especially Teddy, Mia, Olivia, Keda, and Gisela who work in the kitchen and dining area during breakfast time! I was shocked to find out these women were not regularly tipped. The dining area is pretty accessible if it were not busy and a stool was there but those were only provided in my room. (Two stools were set up in my room when I arrived! So cool.) The dining area is crowded every day with lots of people and if you need to take the elevator just make sure you leave 10-20 min early (especially if you're in a wheelchair because no one is giving up their spot on the elevator trying to get downstairs in the morning.

At one point they knew what I wanted to eat, how they could help me on a day when I needed to take my food and run to an early call... they were so nurturing and not just to me but to others as well. The people at the front desk are hardworking and were always ready to help and the guy who sells the tickets is a riot!!! There are 3 elevators inside the lobby which is not far at all from the entrance. I would say though that they do get very busy during certain times of the day when everyone is trying to leave at once.

Good luck finding a hotel in manhattan with a desk or closet without some scuffs This isn't a luxury hotel. You won't feel like a high roller or an aspiring millionaire here. It isn't ""special""- I got over that really fast when I realized those ""special"" hotels often have worse service, no free breakfast, and are in smaller buildings with tiny windows and often views of a brick wall. I obsessed like an OCD crazy person and spent a dozen hours looking for a hotel for this trip because it was fashion week and prices were at a premium. I thought I would be missing out if I didn't stay at a more premium hotel like the hyatt centric (been there- it's great- but not worth the extra cost), the Westin, the W Times Square, or the much more expensive Hilton time square across the street. Or the boutique hotels all over midtown east. Well guess what? This hotel is absolutely all anyone could reasonably hope for. If you aren't going to stay at a $500+ per night 5 star luxury hotel, then just stay here. It's basically as good as anywhere else- all you are missing is the ""I am so rich!"" feeling.

Hot selection changes daily plus fresh fruit, yogurts, pastries but best is make your own waffles fresh you may have to wait for waffle machine but they are worth it especially with breakfast syrup maybe cream yum yum.The hotel is right round the corner from Times Square so you are right in the thick of it all.Didn't find a decent pub for a drink and a dance in the evening but lots of places to eat and lots to see.We don't mind walking and you see so much more, so central park is easy to get to and well worth a visit we even got to go there at night and watch Saturday night fever for free so check to see whats going on in the park as they have lots going on even a free concert by Paramore on Good Morning america but it was at 8-8:30am so also listen to whats said in the morning (Jason Darulo following week).Book a bus tour maybe 48 hour pass just to see the sights plus if you like an area you can hop off then hop back on later, also gets a boat tour thrown in with ours and can have a night tour as well.If your there for a while get a subway week ticket (approx $24) then you can travel all over the place some people we met went to Coney Island which has a beach (something different) or go to a shopping outlet as its much cheaper than a bus trip which costs maybe $40 each.Go to the Harbor and take the Staten Island ferry its FREE so its a free boat trip not much the other side but we sat over looking NYC having a beer in the sun (also cheaper beer as its out of the city).Very hot in August upper 80s but lovely air con that really works in the hotel bedroom.Empire state is about $55 each to go to the very top or about $20 cheaper if you only go to the 86th floor the views are spectacular we had a hot sunny day so great.we had a partial (70%) solar eclipse which you cant just order up as the last one was over 100 years before so watching it under the Brooklyn bridge just amazing, If like us you want to walk the Brooklyn bridge do it as its free but take a drink as you cant get one on the bridge but you can get fresh melon fruit etc but at a price.its only a mile but it is very busy watch out for cyclists as they just go for it.As city breaks go New York lives up to the city that never sleeps it was amazing.Also if you get hungry in the night right opposite the hotel is a huge McDonald's.The hotel location is right in the heart of the action so if you want an action filled break go for it.

We finally came back a tourist! Staying in the heart of Manhattans tourist area 41st. Street. The hotel is small but renovated. All the renovations gave lobby and rooms a more modern look. Rooms are small but manageable. Bathrooms aren't as small as people have stated. HaHa, I've stayed in hotels that you couldn't even open the door if you were on the toilet. The rooms and bathrooms were clean. House keeping was daily. We stayed on the 24th floor with a semi view. Advantage to this Hotel is location location location, not to mention Breakfast is included. The staff were very nice. Maria even texted us to check that everything was OK.My only comment and it's NOT the hotel's fault: the lobby and elevators seem to be hard to be kept clean especially after all the breakfast hoarders spill their containers of food and drinks on the lobby carpet and elevator floors. Unfortunately for all of you and you know who you are that have to take 4 plastic containers FILLED with food along with Yogurts and fruit shoved in your pockets, YOU ALL will ruin it for the rest of the customers because the hotel will soon start charging for breakfast.

I asked them about a refrigerator because the person travelling with me needed to keep their medication cold, and they put one in the room free of charge. The breakfast was quite sufficient, though we did walk to Grand Central Station to enjoy Zara's bagels once we realized they had a location there. :)The location was perfect! Easy walk to Times Square, the theaters, and multiple mass transit locations - Metro, Port Authority, etc. No problems at all taking the F Train out to Citi Field to see ""The Classic East"" concert. We put lots of steps in enjoying the sights.One little tip: The TKTS booths are great, but if you go to the remote location down at Seaport, you'll find a lot less traffic than Times Square, better hours, and great ticket availability. We walked right up to the window at about 1:30 to purchase tickets for a show on Friday evening.I would happily return to this hotel on a future visit to NYC.

Access to metro abounds and there never is an issue getting a cab from the hotel.Stayed in a standard room on the fifth floor for four nights. The rooms are functional of a fairly decent size as per New York hotel room standards , bathrooms again compact but well designed . The room was fairly well insulated though the room didn't have much of a view. The bed was large and quite comfortable . The TV had all the mainstream popular channels including a couple of movie channels as well.Given we were going to be out through most of the day and evenings and merely returning for a nights rest we found the room and the hotel facilities fairly acceptable . However if you wish to spend more time within the hotel property then maybe this is not the place .The hotel organizes breakfast for those who opt for it and while one lauds their effort unfortunately the venue is way too crowded and the self service buffet table hard to access . The fare on offer is not fancy but wholesome such as cereals milk, fruits some form of bacon and eggs. Also there is free flow of tea and coffee through the day in the hotel lobby and a specially nice gesture was for them to organize freshly baked cookies every day in the lobby .The biggest improvement area I felt was the wait time for the elevators during peak hours in the morning. On a couple of occasions I had to trudge down from the fifth floor as there would be no lift access at all possible .To sum up if you are a first time visitor on a budget looking to spend around $130 to $170 per night for a clean centrally located hotel then this place is for you.

It is not private nor does the door fully close so every sound echos into the room. Please have these doors changed Hampton Inn!! Also, the towels that are placed in the rooms are extremely thin.

First of all, there are only 3 elevators for 31 flights, and none of them are service elevators. This means, the room service & housekeeping staff uses their key cards to bypass the elevators to meet their needs. The outcome? Paying customers have to WAIT. Advice: When checking in, ask for a LOWER level room so that you can take the stairs!! 2nd beef: The continental breakfast HOARDERS!!! A word of advice to Hampton....if you want all of your customers to be able to grab a bite for breakfast, PLEASE make it a rule that NOBODY leaves the room with more than a plate of food (not a take-away container). I realize some people bring food up for kids/family who are sleeping a bit later (acceptable), but people will take FULL advantage of the word ""FREE"". I witnessed families taking 3-4 plastic take-away containers, filled with ALL of the muffins, banana bread and pastries -- to the point where the other guests were left with NONE, then proceeded to fill their pockets with bananas and oranges. One lady zoomed to grab the last 4 omelets, knowing there were others behind her in line. Don't allow the selfishness of some to ruin it for your other paying customers.

He was was dismissive and Arrogant when we tried to query a one too many withdrawal on our credit card prior to our arrival and cut my husband off when he tried to explain what had happened, in fact turning to another customer mid check-in to serve someone else when he hadn't even finished ours. We thought if this is the face of this hotel what were we in for! He refused to explain and help us with our inquiry and even listen to what we were trying to say. When he finally finished the check in and gave us our keys it was the bell boy that stepped in and help us with our question to our room and where to go, at least he was lovely. Our parents checked in straight after us and the desk clerk was just as rude to them. I would of rated this hotel a 1 based on this and other frontdesk experiences but to be fair to the hotel itself I included the full experience.The hotel itself was nice enough, we've stayed at many Hampton inn's around America and have always like them for value and service. Our room was clean and amenities comfortable. I loved the beds here, we found them so comfortable. The breakfast is included when you stay and it gets extremely busy, the sitting area is small for the amount of guests that stay here so once we couldn't even have our breakfast because there were no seats left. I suggest you go down early for best selection and a seat to sit in. The range is good, both hot and cold, and freshly cooked waffles are always my favourite. The location of the hotel was right in the thick of things so if you want that, it's great. The theatres right there at the doorstep, restaurants by the dozens, people everywhere, bus terminal only a couple of minutes walk away and the lights of Times Square a short walk away. If you want a less ""full on"" experience, because the people are so many here, then stay further away from this area.

However, be aware there are several issues that keep this hotel getting an Excellent rating. First, the three elevators are inadequate during the breakfast/check out rushes in the morning. So be prepared for a wait. Second, the breakfast room gets crowded around 9am so you may have a short wait for a table. Finally, while we heard no noise from the adjoining rooms, the street noise (even on the 16th floor) is noticeable at night. So request a back room if this will be an issue for you.

The location is great. The hotel is very modern. Probably the best Hampton Inn I've ever stayed at and in the heart of Times Square. The service was also great. The rooms were very modern. I liked the stand up shower instead of the tub. The lobby was clean. They had tea and coffee as all Hampton Inns do. However, they also had cold water which was great. They had heavy doors which blocked the hallway noise. Now for the areas that need improvement.... the elevator traffic in the morning was pretty bad. My suggestion to the hotel is to dedicate one of the elevators to the hotel cleaning crew and staff. You had to wait a long time for the elevators in the morning due to the breakfast traffic, people checking out as well as the hotel cleaning staff. The breakfast area was also over crowded. They were consistently good up of food and could not keep up with it. Perhaps they need to allocate more staff to the breakfast area in the morning.","Austin, Texas","travelerINaustin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin, Texas</strong>",21,5.0

After reading reviews we decided to try the Hampton instead of going where we usually stay...mainly for free breakfast. The staff was rude on a couple of occasions and not helpful at all as far as subway directions (gave incorrect stop once) or suggestions for shuttle to airport when concierge wasn't on duty. A little extra effort and a smile would go a long way with some of these employees. We asked for different pillows and it took 2 days to get them. We received no coffee several days and no new shampoo, lotion on some others. We were there 7 days. Next time we'll be going back to our usual NYC hotel. Some reviews had mentioned a rooftop which they had, but there wasn't so much as a plant up there nor chairs to make it a cool place to spend a moment or two to relax. Can't imagine why it was even mentioned or why it is there!

I used the app to select a room and check-in was fast and easy. The room was a good size for Manhattan. I requested a mini-fridge in advance and it was in the room upon arrival ($20 fee). Great sleep quality - Hampton beds are always good. Given the hotel is in noisiest part of the city, the room was really quiet. You can still hear sirens on this floor, but no other street noise. The A/C system has a constant fan option that's a good source of white noise. Enjoyed and appreciated free coffee/tea/water 24/7 in the lobby. Especially given I was there during a heat wave. Nice to get back to home base when it's 1,000 degrees out and grab some refreshment right away. I did not try the free breakfast - I was up too late or running out too early. I usually love my Hampton Inn stays, but this stay had several issues. I should note that I hate midtown, which is not the hotel's fault. I stayed here because I got a good deal, I'm a Hampton fan, and the reviews were good. The elevators are awful. On my last day, a group of us actually got stuck in a car that would not stop at the lobby and kept going up and down. I had luggage so could not take stairs. A nice man working on the problem rescued me from the 21st floor. It took 20 minutes to get from room to lobby. One evening, after a long day, I came back and all the hallways were dark, except for emergency lights. There was no hot water, internet or TV for a few hours. Not sure if the heat wave affected systems. The shower water pressure is very weak. The TV remote requires an engineering degree to figure out. I thought I'd seen every hotel remote on several continents, but this one stumped me. The towels are prison-issue scratchy. Wi-fi was OK and I was able to watch Netflix with a few hiccups. Plugs on the nightstands would be helpful. I reached out to Maria with my issues and she was lovely.

Breakfast offered varied selections, including cereals, oatmeal, eggs, sausage or bacon, yogurts, fresh fruit, bakery items...the list is long. Of course, juices, soda, coffee, and tea were available. Coffee cups for take-out were available. The lobby is not large, but well-planned. The lobby has different areas for relaxing, reading, watching TV, internet/computer access for guests, who may be waiting for a taxi, an event, a delayed plane or those needing a break..I loved the rooftop terrace. Open to guests, a different perspective of NYC is so cool from the top! You'll want to go up to the terrace and at least take some photos. The view to the north toward Central Park is great and a block away...a little bit of Times Square can be seen! When we were ready to leave, an SUV was made available (at a cost) for our trip to the airport. We have stayed at many other very nice and pricey NYC hotels. For first-time NYC/Manhattan visitors or those wanting a central NYC location, this Hampton would be my choice. We had a bad experience two weeks earlier before our trip overseas, so we cancelled a second reservation there and came here. (See review.)

Cons: You could tell that like most hotels, they don't change the outer bed sheets (the comforter had minor makeup on it) but the inner sheets were clean (I checked all the way to the mattress). I didn't like that the bathroom door is a sliding door that leaves a small crack. I was sharing the room with my sister and we had to make sure not to stand where we could look into the crack to ensure privacy.

We decided to stay in the city to take advantage of the great access to all the sights and sounds of this great city. This Hampton Inn had a great rate for Hilton Honors members so we took advantage of it. We were not disappointed.The hotel location was excellent since it is blocks from Times Square. The hotel is new. (built two years ago) Kris was very helpful on the phone in answering all our questions about the accommodations prior to our trip. He also greeted us at the front desk. He was very friendly and courteous. He made sure that we knew everything about our room and where all the hotel major service areas were located. (breakfast area, fitness room, business area, etc.) He told us to contact him if we had any questions. The room was great. It had a good view of the east side of the city. It was moderate in size. The bed was very comfortable. We did have to get used to the slider door to the bathroom due to privacy concerns but it did save on space. The room overall was very comfortable. The breakfast area was large and very busy. We chose to go during the less busy times. The food selection and variety were very good. There were plenty of healthy foods to choose from. Geraldine and Teddy were very friendly and helpful in assisting us in locating a table and in making sure we were happy with the breakfast. Raymar and Ninoska were also helpful when we decided to stay any additional night. They made sure we got a really good room on the 31st floor – western view of the city. It was a beautiful view. As we checked out, Johnny helped us in getting our Uber driver. We appreciated his help. We thought this was a great additional service of the hotel. This is a great hotel whose management and staff are committed to outstanding customer service. They lived up to the Hampton Brand.

Throughout our stay breakfast room was ok for first few days and we were able to get a seat, however after that we was often waiting up to 10 minutes to get a seat.

In the event you want to get out of the hotel in a timely manner when the hotel is full you are in bad luck. The staff is aware of the situation and there is nothing they can do to make it better. The cleaning crew due to the weight of the cleaning carts causes the elevators to bypass floors when the cleaning equipment is on the elevators. When an elevator finally came after twenty minutes it stopped at nearly every floor on the way down so it took about 25 minutes for me to get down.

The decor was modern and nice, and the entire hotel felt clean and well-kept. One weird thing was the bathroom door was closed with a barn-door style closure. So at times the privacy was awkward as you could hear everything in the bathroom. Also at night it did get loud (as I'm sure any hotel in the city would), but we just ran the fan and it was fine.The location was amazing, as we were in the hard of times square. We walked or took the subway everywhere as there were 2 subway stations within a block or 2. I felt this was a perfect location to do activities both uptown and downtown. The breakfast was great - made our stay so much easier, as food in NYC can get expensive. We started out each day with waffles, oatmeal, toast, eggs - they really had a great selection of food. The seating area did get crowded, but if we were patient a table would tend to open within a few minutes. The front desk folks were really nice and even offered us a room on a higher floor.

We were appropriately recognized as Hilton Honors members and were provided with complimentary water bottles and snacks. The lobby also had free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate. We had a king room on the 26th floor. The room was on the small side but very typical for a NYC hotel. It was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The only slight negatives were that the bath towels were worn and on the thin side and there was no refrigerator in the room. Having breakfast included is also a nice perk. It was a typical Hampton Inn breakfast with the staff working really hard to keep up with the demand. Getting down to breakfast took a while because the elevators were crowded and stopped on almost every floor.

Also, guest services have no idea about telephone standards, they need training. They are not efficient either: we asked an extra towel the first day and it was never delivered.

We had a wonderful stay, though brief. Our family of 2 adults & 1 teen took advantage of the park and stay package for a weekend stay. The parking rates in the area were high, even with discounts, when staying overnight -- this deal beat those prices PLUS it was convenient. The rate covers 24 hours from the time you arrive (x number of days), which worked out perfect for us. We we arrived later in the day & on our departure date, left our bags with the desk when we checked out bust continued to explore the city. As will all NYC hotels, you need to call for the car 30 minutes before you need it since it is in a nearby garage. From curbside to front desk -- breakfast room to cleaning staff navigating the hotel, each and every person was happy AND happy to help. A mix up checking in... same last name as another guest-- had us land in the wrong room. The staff could not work quick enough to get us settled and wanted to make sure we were happy. The hotel is new and well kept. One of the cleanest hotels I have stayed at in NYC. New does not always mean well-kept -- this place was sparkling! We had a double on the 24th floor. Small rooms in the city, but I have seen smaller (and pricier). There were plenty of towels, extra blanket, fully stocked toiletries, and water bottles from the front desk (a Hilton Honors thing - recommend signing up). The bathroom had a sliding frosted door with wood frame which was not a great sound barrier. Attractive design but not the best for soundproofing. We were high up and had no issues with road noise. Nice view. We were across from the elevators and had absolutely NO issues with noise from the hallway. Breakfast was delicious and well stocked. Everything was clean and plentiful. The room was spacious and comfortable--TVs around but not overbearing. Tables mostly, but a little bar type seating area as well. The feature of breakfast being included in the price is only worthwhile if the food is good - and it was! Checkout was fast and everyone was eager to help. We checked our bags behind the desk so we could spend some extra time in the city. There were several staff members on hand, taking the bags, closing out the bill, etc. They seemed to enjoy working together -- that positive energy gave the entire place a ""good vibe"". There was never just one person helping-- staff members were always stepping forward and reaching out. Even coming back for the car, they were asking about us, our stay and making sure we were comfortable until the vehicle arrived. We are already looking forward to our next stay at this hotel.

This hotel is the perfect hotel for the New Amsterdam Theater, as it is right across the street from the back of the theater. The front desk staff was very friendly and efficient, got us checked in and on our way very quickly. Our room was on the 5th floor, facing 41st. The room had two double beds and although on the smaller side was fine for two. The hotel is newer and the room was clean and well maintained. The HVAC worked great, and kept the room the perfect temperature. There was occasional traffic noise, but that's hard to avoid in NYC. Breakfast was Hampton average,. The only real knock on the place is, at 25 floors and 3 elevators, there can sometimes be a wait for an elevator. Being on the 5th floor, sometimes we found it easier to take the stairs. The breakfast area was about the size of a breakfast area at a 4 or 5 story Hampton, so, with 25 floors of people, you can imagine it was packed. That being said, they do try and give you fair warning about the hotel breakfast being busy. Also, allow extra time if you valet parked your car. Sometimes they get a crush of people all wanting their cars at the same time, which can lead to delays. Took almost an hour wait for ours, so leave extra time if check out is busy. All in all a nice stay, and we would certainly come back here if staying in the area for a show!","Palatine, Illinois","Z9433AImikew</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Palatine, Illinois</strong>",63,4.0

Arriving at 8pm on NYE it was a struggle getting to the hotel as Times Square was closed off, we finally made it :)Arriving all excited and ready to kick off our NYE experience in NY we were unfortunately greeted by a rude young lady at reception. We asked if there were any nice local bars where we could go for a drink and was told “everything’s closed, it’s new years eve”. We then asked if the hotel had a bar and was told “no!”. Ok, so we are in New York and everything is closed, great. Fortunately one of our party had emailed Jessica, the assistant manager ahead of time. Jessica had informed us she’d leave a few notes at reception for us upon arrival with a few tips on what to do and where to go. So we asked the young lady at reception if anything had been left to which she replied “No! Nothing!”. Not what you expect when paying $700 for a single night on NYE.The lady then proceeded to take a huge £500 security deposit from my card during check in, why I’ll never know, the basic breakfast is included and there’s no bar, so not sure what they thought I’d be spending £500 on?Anyway my friend who had been in contact with Jessica emailed her immediately, Jessica instantly called us and apologised for the awful service during check in, she also suggest a few nice bar which were in fact open. We proceeded to head out to a bar Jessica recommended and had a fantastic night. Thanks Jess :)The selection at breakfast was basic, to put it politely it was like a mass free for all. People could walk in off the streets for breakfast if they wanted to, no check in in, no being seated, just stroll in and help yourself. Seating is limited so every morning people were spilling out into reception munching on their food, one family was even slumped over the iMac computer in reception eating their breakfast.Anyway all of the negatives aside, the hotel is in a fantastic location, close to everything you’d need. Rooms were cleaned every day, of a high standard and there’s unlimited coffee and water on offer in reception. We paid $1,450 for 6 nights, over new years this wasn’t too bad, but we wouldn’t pay anywhere near this during a normal time of the year.","Monmouthshire, United Kingdom","B25WBthomasp</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Monmouthshire, United Kingdom</strong>",4,3.0

I stay at a lot of Hilton family hotels, and have stayed at several in Manhattan with family over the years. The gentleman who checked us in (Togo) was delightful. Helpful, kind, playful and handsome to boot! I liked the security the hotel had in the elevators, requiring guests to touch their room keys to a pad in order to select their floor. (I've had this on ""select"" floors before, but never for everyone. It was a comfort, knowing the elevators are right off the street and anyone could walk on.) We stayed in room 2409, which had a nice view south, and met all our simple needs, but was rather tiny. I reminded myself that it is Manhattan, and I wasn't paying top dollar for this room.... for what I paid, and where it was, it was perfect. The room was well maintained, and the bathroom renovated in a decor similar to the other Hilton family brands. My only gripe about Manhattan hotels (this being the 3rd in the Times Square area I've stayed at in the last 3 weeks), is the food service hours. This hotel doesn't have room service (which ended by 10pm in other hotels), but it does serve breakfast. Unfortunately the breakfast ends at 10am, and we missed it when we slept in late. Other than that, the hotel is clean, well maintained, pleasantly staffed, and only 1 block off of Times Square (41st between 7-8 Avenues), so is perfectly located near it all!","Floral Park, New York","KDeegs423</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Floral Park, New York</strong>",39,4.0

Now while I check the reservation on the app, the reservation was doubled and we only need one room and are checked in. I went to front desk again and told the person the situation. He then told me to call the HH 1800 number. As I called the lady at HH line was very nice like the true spirit of the hospitality as the true meaning of a hotel. She called this hotel itself and it made my call to them 50 mins. We have to cut our call since it's super extra ordinary for this type of issue for a A corporate office calling the branch or franchisee to have this Loooong wait. Ending issue unresolved but sending me an email for this. Then come the Manager of the particular hotel whom I felt being discriminated (pardon the wrong use of word - if it comes that way-I'm a tourist guess to this hotel). She just as the same case with Maria whom I believe is white like the Manager, I even asked my partner to introduce me to her but just kept on ignoring me. Finally, my partner just acknowledged the error even he don't understand technical issues with the HH app on our phones. Ms Manager said as a courtesy. She is waiving the cancellation fee for being HH member. Seriously? Then I really interjected for me to step in and my partner then told the manager to speak to me. The she looked at me. I finally started my piece and just said ""my issue is not ended since I was the one on the phone that have your beach made me and the corporate on the phone for 50 mins just because of that"". and she just said that's why she had taken care of that. It just made me think again, if she did paid attention to what I just said and I realized that no she did not, when I'm already at the elevator going to my room. "" for me issue was only partially resolved. Because the detail becomes more because of her very intelligent reply to my issue which is not fully understood and have paid attention. I will just communicate with the HH corporate because for me, this was just another not so good example of what customer service business they are in. New York hotel rates are expensive among the cities that I have been to any of the states that I have been to as well. New York, NY it's fabulous that's why they named it twice. Like the song New York, NY, when you survived it you'll make it anywhere. This quality of customer service for me is not among that will pass my standards as a tourist coming from the other part of the world. We pay high price to stay in a not so luxorious hotel from our hard end money that somewhat contributed to the salary of the hotel employee as well being a Diamond tier (which is the highest and last tier) membership for this hotel chain. I'm sorry, if my standards for the quality of customer service satisfaction become so low if what I felt it is not met. Anyways, this is just a review and it's readers decision still remains valid or not if their ways are good enough to survive particularly to the business Hampton Inn is in. For now, it's only this branch that I noticed and had this issue had made me call my attention. ",California,"Ryan B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>California</strong>",0,2.0

The rooms were a comfortable size and the bathroom was nice with a decent shower. The room had the usual amenities, hair dryer, iron & ironing board, safe and coffee facilities. The bed was nice and comfy but the duvet cover did look a little tired and the pillows were extremely soft. They felt like feather but when we changed them for foam ones there was only a little bit of improvement. Other than that, we slept well, after exploring New York City theres not too much that keeps you awake (other than loud patrons who slam their doors rather than allowing them to close gently). There are 3 lifts which operate on all floors so they do get a little busy from time to time. Particularly around breakfast time, after 8:20 roughly. The breakfast was nice, not many hotels have breakfast included so this helped with our selection. It can get busy so again you want to get down for breakfast before 8:30 to get a table. The usual food offerings were available, make your own waffles, fruit, toast, pastries and some cooked items. It's not a massive selection but it certainly fits the bill for a few days. The location for this hotel was perfect for us, just off Time Square made it very easy for us to walk to many attractions; Empire State Building, the High line in Chelsea, Madison Square Garden, Bryant park and Rockefellar centre were all within reasonable walking distance. It is also close to several subway stops which helps when you want to head to the very bottom of Manhattan. Most of the staff that we spoke to were very friendly and helpful and offered advice when we asked about the return journey to the airport. They confirmed that have a car service back to JFK for a set fee of $70 plus tip. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and would consider the hotel on a return visit.

I've never stayed in such a small place in all of my travels and I am mostly loyal to Hilton brands. Check in was great. Couldn't have asked for better. It was a busy weekend so I didn't expect much. The elevators were small although there were three. With that being said I spent a lot of time waiting on elevators and even had to take the stairs up to the 12th floor a few times. Thank God I didn't get the 20th floor room I had originally requested. We did take advantage of the coffee and tea bar. That area stayed crowded but it worked. Two people can't walk down the hallways at the same time. The room was sooooo tight that we had to stay packed at all times. Any thing outside of your luggage made the room look junky and cluttered. We couldn't even store the luggage in the closet because it was small too. It was the size of a small coat closet with a safe and tray on the floor. We parked the luggage against the space by the window to move it out of the way. I will say the room was very clean and housekeeping was on top of keeping it that way. The bathrooms on the concourse were very clean with the amount of traffic. They get an A+ for cleanliness and service We did get back to the room one might just in time for cookies. Don't understand how cookies can make you feel so thankful but they do. The price we paid was astronomical but we expected that for New Years Eve on Times Square. You could literally walk out of the door to the corner and see the ball drop and you are inside of the police barricade so that's goes along with the price. My husband is f firefighter so his badge allows us to go a little further, down to the center, by the stage. This hotel is a perfect location for your TSQ visit. It is out of the way of the 42nd street traffic but just steps away from everything. We only ate breakfast there once but was so crowded that we decided to forego breakfast and just do lunch outside of the hotel.

Which leads to the next constraint, table seating for breakfast. The staff in the kitchen actually did a great job of keeping the food stocked, I have seen much worse but this group stayed ahead of the crowd. What was lacking was a place to sit once we had food. With the poor elevator situation, going back to your room with an arm full of food was out, so we saw a lot of people just go grab a seat in the lobby and balance a plate on their lap. I'm sure management already knows this is an issue because they put out ""to go"" breakfast bags as an option. Nice try but it doesn't resolve the space limitations. The room itself was small, but clean. Room for two double beds and and a desk, that was it however its NYC, we were not in the room very much anyway except to sleep. Mattress was hard, not my style but it was fine for a few nights. Overall for NYC, with breakfast included and one block from 42nd street, I would stay again. Just bring your patience.P.S.

We even did that a few times despite the fact we were on a floor above 20. Our room had no mini-fridge or ice bucket and nor was there ice available anywhere near our floor. There is no room service, so we had to go out for everything - hard given the challenge of getting to and from our room using the lifts!!! Add to this the fact that breakfast is a badly disorganised scrum - with very ordinary food served to an overpacked room where we were often unable to find a seat - so we just gave up and ate elsewhere. To be fair, the rooms are comfortable and staff generally positive and friendly - but a free chocolate chip cookie doesn't make up for such an overall terrible experience.

So the grading range is pretty narrow. Have stayed at most of the Hiltons, Hamptons, Garden Inns in midtown, but first time here -- and probably last time. On the plus side, I think the location is great. A relatively quiet location one short block from the craziness of 42nd and 7th/Broadway. The rooms are a decent size (at least my room was), the A/C and heat work well, good TV and channel selection, very friendly staff. On the down side, the hotel is under-elevatored, so on a lower floor in the mornings, can easily have several elevators full of upper floor guests stop before you get one with space. On upper floors, can be a good wait while elevators work their way up. The breakfast area is undersized and a madhouse during much of the morning (we just ate at the Gleason a few steps down the street - well worth the extra expense). And our room and floor whistled. By that I mean that the heat/air system was sufficiently strong, and the door in our room hung in a particular way, such that there was a constant wind-like whistling in our room (also in the30th floor hallway). Solved by stuffing a towel under or room door. But the worst was the pillows and bedding. OK, you may think that's crazy, but the room is ultimately a place to sleep, and that was a bit of a challenge for me. The pillows were about the limpest I have ever had in a hotel (was at a dude ranch a few years ago that was worse, but never at a big hotel). Not sure if they were just lousy pillows or were well passed their replacement time, but virtually no support. And the hotel uses a very heavy duvet on the bed (I recall Hampton went this direction once, but do not know if this is still a system wide Hampton thing). In any event, unless you like to be VERY warm in bed, finding a comfortable sleep temperature can be iffy. So why stay here? Again, location and fir my stay, price for the location. Doubt I will stay here again. The Garden Inn on 42nd is a better hotel for me. A bit noisier location, and pay for breakfast, but better sleep quality for what is often about the same price.","Berlin, Germany","gamevod</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Berlin, Germany</strong>",62,3.0

Very convenient location right off Times Square. Beautiful lobby. Very nice front desk staff.You have to swipe your room-key before you can push the button for any floor of this thirty floor hotel. It's so annoying sitting there while everyone swipes their cards and pushes their room numbers. Try having two cups of coffee and swiping your card and pushing a button. It cannot be done. I appreciate security but this is not the answer. I had several issues with the room. For NYC the room was a decent size. I did not like the sliding door on the bathroom as you really have no privacy due to large gaps in-between the door and the wall on both sides. It looks cool but it does not function well. The curtains are totally inadequate to cover the windows. I could not get the room dark and when you have a room right off of Times Square there is so much flashing light coming through the windows it made it difficult to sleep. This is a very noisy hotel. We were put next door to a room with multiple children. Interesting thing about that is that this family had two rooms and the hotel put their other room across the hall instead of next door so there was lots of kid noise early in the morning between those two rooms. It sounded like the kids were sitting in our room that's how not sound-proofed the walls were. There was no notepad nor pen in the room. I almost exclusively stay in Hampton Inns and have never not had a notepad and a pen. Usually I would travel with those items anyway but this time I didn't have any paper and needed some. Went down to the front desk to ask for a notepad and the clerk tells me that the whole hotel is out of them and she hands me a few post-it notes. That is either very poor management or a stupid way to save money at a $400/night hotel -- not providing a pen and a pad of paper. Also for $400.00 a night why was there rarely ever a doorman to help with bags and flagging down taxis? That's a NYC hotel standard. But I rarely saw one out there at this hotel. Bottom line...this is a really nice hotel. It is. You should try it out. I just want them to address some of these issues with the room and the other things that made this stay less than excellent.,Atlanta,"Jill P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Atlanta</strong>",70,3.0

I am a former New Yorker who has lived away for many years. Over the years we have visited many times and we have always stayed in five star east side hotels. This time we decided to make things easy on ourselves and stay in the theater district. We chose the HI Times Square Central for location and reviews. What a great decision. This is a terrific hotel. The facilities are excellent, the location is perfect and the staff are extraordinarily kind and helpful. We checked into our 28th floor room away from the elevator as we requested on the app and when we arrived close to 11:00 PM our process was swift and correct. Front desk personnel were charming and a small snack bag was provided. The extra pillows we requested were in our room. The room was small but beautifully furnished. Great bed, desk and chair, a real closet with a safe, ironing board and iron and nice hangers. Well lit bathroom and nice shower. Plenty of towels. Multiple USB charging ports at desk and near the bed. Good lighting in bedroom. Surprisingly quiet with no street noise. The hotel says the rooms are soundproof and ours seemed to be. The only noise we heard were a few voices in the hall for a few moments. Housekeeping was done early in the day and was very nicely completed. Breakfast in the dining area was well done. Hampton Inns have a nice breakfast selection and this was up to the standard. Hot and cold food, eggs cereals, pastries fruit coffee etc. very very nice staff in the breakfast room kept food refreshed and tables bussed cleaned and ready. Considering how busy the hotel was the breakfast experience was really great in large part due to the diligence and friendliness of the crew. Elevator service was fast and generally not overcrowded. We never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for the lift. There is a small convenience market in the lobby and 24 hr coffee and tea. Because of the excellent location we were able to walk to and from the theater performances. For other things we used Uber. Since the hotel is so centrally located waits were never more than five minutes for car to arrive. Maria and Letitia at the front desk were particularly gracious. Maria emailed us the day of arrival to see if we needed anything special and saw to it everything we asked for was in place. Letitia was always smiling and warm. Overall one could not chose a better hotel for a theater visit. Frankly the service put many five star hotels we have stayed at to shame.

There are three elevators, and you may wait some time before getting one, but steps are available. Breakfast area was clean and well stocked. At busy times you may have to wait for a table.

The size of the room was small but adequate and probably the norm in the city. The room safe came in handy as did the coffee maker and ironing board and iron.The housekeeping staff did a great job with the cleaning everyday and was very responsive to anything that we needed.That being said the entire staff was very professional as well as helpful. The morning breakfast bar was crowded and busy and the food was standard Hampton Inn fare with everything clean and the food fresh. Again the staff there was very professional as well. Even with the crowd we easily found a clean table to sit at each morning.We were happy to have a concierge in the lobby that was very helpful with advice as well as making reservations for us at a fantastic restaurant, Arno, on 38th St. for us.The three elevators served us well after a few minute waits from time to time and two trips that were rather crowded. Not bad for a busy NY hotel.The location of the hotel is perfect as it is just off of Seventh Ave. which is busy but you can walk West over to Eighth and Ninth where there are a number of restaurants and a wine shop at 594 Eighth Ave that seemed to have reasonable prices even for NY.All in all a very pleasant stay and if and when we return to NYC we will stay there again.","Williamsburg, Virginia","jpete</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Williamsburg, Virginia</strong>",191,4.0

I guess the higher floors do have rooms with a view.The room was not enormous but quite sufficient. It was cleaned every day and the towels changed too, even when we didn't ask for this. There are facilities for making drinks in the room but this was rarely necessary as there are free hot drinks (tea/coffee/hot choc) available in the lobby all the time - and there are also often fresh cookies!Breakfast was served over several hours to suit everyone. There was always plenty of fresh fruit, hot food and also batter to make your own waffles! It was quite crowded at 'peak times' but it was always possible to find a table. The kitchen staff were very friendly and helpful.The hotel has a small shop (and a microwave in the lobby) and an area for printing plane tickets etc... and every morning there's a desk where one can book trips and shows.On the last day we were able to leave our luggage in reception as we had a late evening flight. The reception staff were always very polite.The one issue we had was the lifts: too slow and not enough of them so you could end up waiting for a long time at 'peak times'!

The cons are mainly minor issues. The cons for this hotel are as follows:- The rooms are on the small side but I think most NYC hotel rooms are like this. - The flat sheet on the bed doesn't overlap off the sides of the bed far enough, maybe 3-4 inches. I don't like this because when you turn over or your partner pulls on the sheets a little on their side of the bed, there's not enough of the sheet left on your side of the bed to fully cover you. I've seen this same situation at other hotels so I don't know what the deal is with the sheets. At home my flat king sheet overlaps about 12 inches on each side.- It was a little too dark in the bathroom for putting on make-up.

Elevators were always quick and available. The room was small but clean, and in NY, I will take that any day. The rooms are also modern and functional, and the bathroom is great with a good shower. The sheets are silky and nicer than what is in most Hampton Inns. I also found the room to be surprisingly quite; you can also set the AC fan to always on - a huge feature to me!Breakfast was very typical Hampton; it's fine for what it is, but you could definitely find other way better options nearby. With that said, if you have lunch and dinner plans, it is fine for grabbing a quick, light bite before heading out. You can also grab a to-go breakfast. Finally, enjoy warm cookies in the evening.The location is good for several train stops and for Times Square.The only real disappointment for me is that the rooftop was locked. There is a deck up there with elevator access, but you can't walk outside. I would have liked to have enjoyed the view.All told, I would stay here again in a heartbeat.

I hope her manager recognizes that she is wonderful with the customers. The breakfast area was swamped and it was difficult to find a seat, but the staff did what they could with what they had.

(I've included a pic here of the view from my room - judge for yourself if it's worth the extra money...) The view from the ""viewing deck"", two floors up, is no better. Lastly, the morning I left I needed to get to Brooklyn pier: the bellhop told me it was just as cheap to use the limo service he recommended as it would be to call a cab; $70 - so I took his advice. But it turned out, on the way back, the cab fare was only $30 - so another ripoff! This was my first stay at a Hilton, after joining their Honours programme.

I paid over £700 for 2 nights. I had a less-than welcoming check-in - no smiles, a mumbling receptionist, and was sent to the second floor. The elevators took forever (there are only 3 to service 20+ floors - I started just taking the stairs). From my room there was no view. Other than a building and bit of roof. I called down and asked on the off chance if there was a chance of moving to a higher room - no. Everything was fully booked. The room is basic. Big bed but: a stained welcome book, no hotel notepad, no glasses, only paper cups which weren't replaced as I used them. I didn't even have a bathmat the first night. The air con smelled funky and all in all just the basic of basic amenities. Huge TV sure but I wasn't really there to watch tv.  After heading out to meet a friend I returned and called down to ask if they had a corkscrew. After much mumbling I was told to come down to reception as they might have one there. I went down and there were multiple parties checking in. All assigned double rooms higher up than the 2nd floor - I know that it depends on length of stay but the overall service was of 'can't be bothered' so wouldn't be surprised if there were rooms I could have moved to. After being made to wait 5 minutes without acknowledgement - not even a 'I'll be with you in a minute' the guy behind reception just looked up and said: ""it was you who wanted a cork screw? We don't have one.""Next morning for breakfast - paper plates. All in the name of the 'environment'. I don't believe it. Paper plates and plastic forks and a poor selection of food. I ate out the second morning. Every single request of mine was met with disdain. I don't know if it's because I'm a woman travelling alone, or if it's just total complacency of 'hey, we have a hotel in Times Square, we'll fill it and we don't even have to try!'I love travelling, I love trying new hotels. I have a lot of great experiences and it makes me sad that somewhere like this can charge so much and treat customers with such arrogance and indifference. I would absolutely NOT recommend this place. The location is not worth the treatment you get. What’s best is that I know by posting this, the complacency of the hotel will only show itself to shine. There will be a stock response that will say something like this: “ I hope that in the future should your travel plans include New York City that you would reach out to me directly and consider giving us another try. Thank you again for sharing your recent experience.”I did reach out and contact the hotel directly a week ago in the hope that I would get some response. I got nothing.","Brighton, United Kingdom","littleunred</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brighton, United Kingdom</strong>",22,1.0

I'm a Hilton diamond member so get a free room voucher each year and chose this hotel because it fit the bill for the room type we needed to fulfill the voucher. Due to its high price tag, I also chose to use points to pay for another night because it was hard to justify at almost $400 per night. We had a basic 2 double bed room on the 24th floor. No rooms were available for upgrade but they did put us on a high floor for viewing.The good: Ridiculously comfortable bedsTons of outlets available near the tables to plug devices intoVery quiet hotel given the hustle and bustle of Times SquareLocation to subway is perfectVery friendly and helpful concierge (John)Decent free breakfastLightning fast elevatorsFree snack bag at front desk for breakfast on the runCustomer service check in via text to be sure your stay is good.Housekeeping done in the room mid afternoon.Great car service booking available at front deskAir conditioning works great!The bad:Mildew smell in bathroom - fan doesn't work wellSome front desk help weren't very friendly.No bar/restaurantNo rooms available for upgrade - very basic hotelTiny roomsNo fridge/microwave in roomMinimal vanity space for toiletry itemsHard to block out light in bedroom and light on ceiling flickers all nightNo outlet near bedroom mirror to get ready outside of bathroom (no way 2 people can share the tiny bathroom)To be honest, we just really weren't in the hotel very much each day of our 3-day stay. Personally, I wouldn't stay in Times Square again because I felt it was much too touristy for my liking. That being said, it was an excellent location for subway use and walking to many local attractions. The street its located on is quiet with much less noise than others. John at the concierge desk helped us find a great show to see (Paramour) which was right across the street, though we found out later that we paid about $100 more per ticket than we should have...so beware of the mark up and fees associated with using the concierge and look for a good show app or discount tickets instead. Some of the front desk staff were nice but others refused to smile and seemed annoyed by our questions. They did have a great black car service for $60 to the airport that proved to be much better than a taxi or Uber. We felt very safe and secure in this hotel. If you like small hotels in the middle of a big city, this hotel would be great for you. I would never, however, pay the $400 price tag for Friday/Saturday nights for this hotel - its just too basic to pay that much.","Lander, Wyoming","BeckyC981</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lander, Wyoming</strong>",27,4.0

It's central Midtown location just round the corner from Times Square and 42nd Street is excellent. You are within very easy walking distance of The Empire State Building, Grand Central, Penn Station, Madison Square Gardens and Macy's to name just a fraction.The Staff in this hotel are very helpful, friendly and very keen to please - no request was too much trouble. The rooms are not spacious but fine, comfortable and very clean and that's all we needed.Our only slight criticism is the Breakfast area on the ground floor can be very busy especially after 7.30 am onwards and is not big enough for the amount of rooms. (Special mention to Geraldine at this point - a lovely warm Irish American welcome awaits all from her at breakfast). The hotel offers a flat rate private car service to JFK for not much more than the flat rate Yellow cab fare you pay coming from JFK, which we thought was good value in the circumstances.One tip is eating out. The further away from Midtown/ Times Square the better value you get. After the local taxes and obligatory tip/ service charge ( which is included most of the time but believe is still optional), a basic lunch can be quite expensive even without alcohol. Just to put in context we found like for like restaurants in somewhere like East Village half or less in price than around Midtown.If you are in New York for a few days or more the get the weekly Metro card for the subways - Currently $32 dollars and you can go anywhere on the system.Finally if you want a relaxing time out from the hustle and bustle, a walk in Central Park is a marvellous experience.","London, United Kingdom","CCR_GR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",30,4.0

However, this was the easiest and most pleasant stay we could have imagined, especially practically in busy Times Square.The staff went beyond the service we normally expect in many ways.First, we requested valet parking and the front desk clerk noticed my son left his ipad in the car. He personally walked it to our room and explained he didn't want to risk it being taken by the valet service.Then, a dining area associate overheard me worrying that we wouldn't have enough time to sight see and check out in time. She personally made arrangements for a late check out. We were still late getting back, called ahead to apologize and were told not to worry, they would call valet and our car would arrive by the time we gathered our items and checked out.The rooms/beds were clean and comfy with decent city views. The ample complimentary breakfast was a great way to start an active day.Bonus, there was plenty of metered parking on the street in front of the hotel.you could easily leave your car free 12-7 am...but we were staying in the city most of the day.The valet parking price (55 SUV) was the same as what we found for self parking on our own.",ROANOKE,"Beth B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>ROANOKE</strong>",3,5.0

Not adverse to walking I happily walked up to Central Park approx 20mins at a steady pace. Times Square is right around the corner, getting in and around here is pretty chaotic, on an early visit I stayed further up above Times Square and would probably chose this in the future simply to avoid having to walk through this busy area. Hotel offers breakfast decent basic spread to get you going in the morning however due to the size of the hotel the breakfast room was often overflowing. The room was pretty basic just two beds tv and bathroom, there was no fridge in the room - pretty standard hotel expectation this was a little annoying as we stayed 7 nights and would have been convenient, you can hire a fridge for $20/n... There's 3 lifts to service the 30 something floors often one being used for cleaning service makes the mornings a tricky time to get up and down found ourselves using the stairs from the 11th floor quite a few times!

This was the second time I stayed at this property and my last. The first time was awful but gave it another chance. Mistake! This time was much worse. Let's start with the fact that this hotel looks modern but it's in an old building with paper thin walls and no sound proofing. You can literally here everything in the next room. In my case I was woken by the woman in the next to my room screaming and laughing in Turkish after they returned from a night out. What makes this worse was they sounded so close I thought they were in the hall in front of my door. I called to the front desk several times to ask them to send someone up to quiet the people down so I could sleep. I had a client meeting the next morning and needed sleep. However the young lady that answered the front desk phone (named Nene) seemed to care less but sounding annoyed said she would send the night supervisor up to find out what was going on. 30 minutes went by and the loud laughing and yelling people next door kept it up. Finally had to re-pack all my things and move to another room near the elevator which also kept me up that night when people were getting on and off at my floor. The hotel just doesn't seem to have any sound proofing. As if that wasn't enough, the next morning I was trying to get to my client meeting and was stopped dead in my tracks trying to get one of the tiny elevators to stop on my 6th floor. After 15 solid minutes of watching elevators not stop in my flooring decided to walk down the 6 fights of stairs instead with all my luggage in tow so I wouldn't miss my meeting. Checking out was also a joke as they didn't seem to know how to print a simple receipt and after standing there again forever I finally left to get to my appointment.

Granted, I was on the 29th floor, but I had to wait about 8 minutes for an elevator. Once on the elevator, it stopped at EVERY SINGLE FLOOR. It was extremely frustrating.

It was perfectly located, new, clean, provided all our necessities (except for one, which I will mention below) and we were allowed an early check-in and check-out. The free breakfast was also a bonus and so was the 24 hour coffee, tea and water in the front entrance of the hotel. I would have to say two reasons were the reason I couldn't give this hotel a five star rating. First was that there was no fridge in our hotel room. This was our first time without a fridge in our hotel room in ages. I couldn't believe how much I missed not having one. It might not seem like a big deal, but after a whole day of sight seeing or shopping it would've been nice to chill before getting ready for dinner with a nice cold beer or glass of white wine, especially in the summer months. The second reason was a couple hours after checking-out my husband remembered he forgot his pillow in the hotel room. I went to the front desk and asked if he could locate the pillow. He called house keeping and was told by two housekeepers that managed our floor that they could not locate nor did they find a pillow in our room. The front desk personnel was great and thought to call lost and found, but we were not successful in finding the pillow. This was as we were leaving the hotel, after a great time in NYC and it left a bad taste in our mouth. I recommend anyone staying here to please remember to bring all their belongings because there is high chance you won't see them again. I'm just glad it was not our passports or money we left behind.","Toronto, Canada","JTd0t</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",29,4.0

This was in early August... YMMV.2) Room got cleaned every day. One day, someone even came by to confirm as much.3) Room size was not an issue for us.

Considering that I've paid close to $200 for a Holiday Inn Express out in the Plains states, I guess it's not so bad. I really don't even know how much the more upscale hotels in NYC are getting these days... We just wanted a reasonably-priced place, with a reputable brand, at which our family could crash for the night. It was only one night, and we didn't plan to do more than sleep here. And that's about all you can do, as there is minimal space beyond that occupied by the two queen-size beds and desk. The room was reasonably clean. The bathroom looked relatively up-to-date, which is more than I can say for the carpeting. There was an initially musty smell upon first walking into the room, but I have experienced that in many places and it seems to be something you get used to after a while; it is probably at least partially due to the cleaning materials used. The beds were OK, not especially comfortable, but the bedding seemed clean and fresh. The lobby carpet is a bit dirty and doesn't give a great first impression, but the large room in back where the continental breakfast is served is nice. The front desk staff was very friendly and helpful.

Very cool that they wrapped the apples in cellophane hygienically. Rooms pretty dark with black-out curtains--very important to us. We taped them to the walls and blocked the hems for even better darkness. Kevin at the desk was nice and personable and insisted on getting us our extra linens during our 3:30 a.m. check in, which was nice of him. He said it was no problem because he had a full maid staff on duty during the night--cool! Fast towel service has not been my experience at other hotels and resorts. A maid insisted on running up to the next floor to get a towel that was out of stock on my floor and was back in a flash, which was sweet of her. Another polite young man brought us a fresh bedcover very quickly our first night at 4 a.m.--ours had hair on it. Another young desk gentleman was trying to procure a map of the city at the concierge station after hours but couldn't gain access to one, so he turned on the big screen in the lobby with the map for me in trying to assist, which I appreciated. Hampton seems to have well-mannered people who are well trained in customer service and are people pleasers! :) Rooms not too small to be able to function in as a family, especially in NYC. Pretty roomy closet, big windows, decent storage in bathroom and along window shelf, better shower pressure would be appreciated, bright hallways, clean elevators and lobby. Appreciated the small quiet floors. Loved the bed and pillows! I would just lay and feel what it was like to have such a comfortable mattress. Gave my joints and muscles a break and healing time to change beds from my own.","Phoenix, United States","Kurt P</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Phoenix, United States</strong>",1,5.0

It is located within an easy walk of both MSG and the theatre district, with many restaurants to enjoy as well. It was incredibly easy to grab a cab for museum hopping across town. The staff was quite helpful and were happy to hold our bags after check out so that we could continue to walk around. Our room was impressive; clean enough to satisfy this neat freak and ridiculously large by NYC standards. It easily fit our family of 5 on two queen beds and a very comfortable pull out sofa (I thought that was an oxymoron!). The furniture and decor of the room were quite modern and not all at tired. We also particularly enjoyed the roof top deck with fabulous views of the city at night.The complimentary breakfast in the lobby kept my teenagers satisfied!We will definitely stay again on future weekends in town.Tip- Join Hilton Honors for free in room Wifi",Northern NJ,"happymomx3</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northern NJ</strong>",172,5.0
