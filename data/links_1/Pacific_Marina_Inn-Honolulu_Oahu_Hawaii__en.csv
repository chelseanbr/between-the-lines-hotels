I could have saved the $117 rate plus the $10 resort (?) fee due at check in. It did not bother me that it is in a district of warehouses. What did bother me was the run down condition, the poor house keeping (evidenced by an obvious long black hair hanging off the ""fresh"" hand towel) and the level of some of the other guests staying here. I suspect a number of these people may have been staying on a subsity voucher from their appearance and a number of cars that were certainly owned by locals and were not from a rental company. The Chinese restaurant it front was the same caliber as the motel. Every 15 minutes I was subjected to the stench of a smoker as if wiffed into my room.Baffled by the good reviews.

For this last trip, our bed was extremely uncomfortable. Just hard like every spring is just done. My husband and I had sore backs every morning. Time to throw out these mattresses. (Oh, and pretty much every “Queen” size bed we’ve had there was not a Queen, they were Full-size mattresses.) I don’t know if this hotel is going to be affected by the rail system coming through—like if they have to close down because they are in the path—and that’s why the rooms aren’t being changed out, upgraded, or given on super good cleaning/painting head to toe. If that’s what is happening, then I understand and will keep staying there while it’s still around. But if they are staying, I hope they do some major cleanup and upgrades soon.

(Our AirBnb couldn’t accommodate our entire stay.) Although the room was clean and fairly decent, we needed to stay on a Saturday night. The place was Party Central. Dive bar downstairs serves until 2am, and apparently they’ll serve you way beyond the point of no return. Drunks were stumbling all over the place. One got on the elevator with me and when I got off on the third floor, so did he. I purposefully went a direction other than my own room so that he didn’t know where my room was. He stumbled back on to the elevator and returned to the bar, I’m guessing. Pool was just below us and other guests made use of it well into the night. I must say that the staff was nice.

We had no hot water. Paint was flaking off on the door frame. Not enough pillows for two people. Hubby used bathroom towels to plump up his pillow and I used my airplane pillow under my pillow.

There is also a small convenience store with basic groceries and sundries in the back of the lobby. towards the patio and pool area. The hotel is two mid-rise room blocks, with a pool between them. At night the pool is nicely lighted up. There were plenty of chairs and loungers poolside.The room: Ours was a small room, on the ground floor, facing the pool, close to the lobby. The room had a queen-size bed, with basic bedding. There was a small TV, a desk with a chair and a loud air conditioning unit. There was no safe in the room or a closet. The bathroom was also small and basic. Make sure to bring your own toiletries. The shower water pressure was decent. The WiFi was free but sluggish at times.All in all, this is a good option if you just need a room to sleep after you land in HNL, before departing the next morning. The rooms are small and need much updating, but the value is solid and the free shuttle is a great perk.","New York City, New York","Brooklynite_Abroad</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",834,4.0

I spent 5-nights during a business trip and found the property very convenient and comfortable and as a solo-female traveler I felt safe. I found the guests to be a mix of business and vacation travelers. While small and local-style, it is apparent that the owners take pride in their small slice of Oahu hospitality. The rooms are very compact and sparsely furnished but have all the necessities and are very clean and tidy. The beds are comfortable. The linens are clean & white. The water is hot and has great pressure. I saw no evidence of Hawaii's state bug - roaches! Free parking but rent a compact car as stalls are typical Hawaii-Narrow.The on-site bar (dive) and separate Chinese restaurant (excellent takeout!) are very handy. The State Park out back is very convenient for the evening leg-stretch session and appears to be popular with the local soft-ball leagues and canoe racing clubs. Note that this is a classic Hawaii old-school hotel -- stress on the 'OLD'. There is evidence of several decades of use in the tropical climate that is Hawaii - warped wood doors and cracked paint resulting from humidity battles - but for the price and location, this hotel is a very good value. My only complaints; The individual wall-mounted AC units are loud and lack a low-level setting to provide quieter ventilation which is needed because there are no windows that can be opened and leaving a door open to the main walkway isn't an option. The rooms do have ceiling fans which help.

I’ve stayed there several times when in town on business trips. If you’re looking for the exotic tourist resort experience though, this is not your destination. Complimentary morning tea and coffee are available in the lobby. Frequent shuttle vans run back and forth to the airport. Housekeeping staff is friendly and helpful. If you have a car, parking is free. The new elevator will be operational in the near future. Basic rooms are comfortable and mostly quiet. The lobby is decorated in a retro tiki theme with island-style chairs and a desk with tourist brochures. The hotel is located near a lagoon park, which might explain the increase in apparently homeless individuals wandering the property during my most recent stay. While I have sympathy for their situation, I expect not to have to deal with noise, smoke (both cigarette and pakalolo) and scary characters during business trips.

I am in the military and I booked this about four days ago because I needed to get out of my current house quickly so I booked Airbnb. Upon arrival the receptionist was very nice very professional the lobby was cleaning I got my room it was on the first floor thank goodness because I don’t like stairs. They provide coffee complementary 24 hours a day. They do offer shuttle which I strongly encourage you to use because parking is very very limited when it fills up.

So if your jet lag left you absolutely ravenous at 3:00 a.m., these folks had you covered. The rooms were clean, neat and pleasant. The pool looked lovely and was also very clean. I didn't swim in it as I was only there a short time. We checked out at 10:00 a.m. after our second night, and had a flight to Maui at 3:40 p.m. The inn was kind enough to store our suitcases for us while we went sightseeing and they also shuttled us back to the airport for our flight, even though we were no longer guests. A couple of notes about businesses near the motel but not actually part of it: do NOT, repeat DO NOT eat at the Chinese ""restaurant"" next to the motel. If you have happy memories of Chun King Chow Mein, you'll love the place. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and buy a sandwich from the 24 hour shop at the motel. There is a small ""saloon"" near the motel as well. It's a ""local"" in the most highly-colored sense of the word. I am glad I went, just to have the story.

They have a free airport shuttle and the driver was very friendly and helpful, providing all sorts of tips for the stay in Honolulu. The location itself would appear to be a bit sketchy at first, as hotel is located in a industrial area, not an unsafe area just industrial with not much in the ways of restaurants, stores ect. The property contains a onsite Chinese restaurant with limited hours, and a hotel bar staffed by a friendly bar tender, with cheap drinks and offered free roasted turkey with white rice as a snack. There was karaoke going on with the same singers over and over. Not bad free entertainment. The room I had was recently updated with paint, flat screen tv and new flooring. There was an opening under the door which allowed quite a bit of light through but after 10 hrs of flying, it didn't matter much. The bathroom was also updated with new shower tile. The room and bathroom were overall smaller than usual for motel's but was comfy. The window unit AC allowed for the temp to be set so it turned on and off instead of running constantly. There is an onsite store for soda/snacks/ect which is decently priced. Fairly large selection also. A true advantage of this location is the proximity to Pearl Harbor and the Norwegian Cruise Line Pride of America cruise ship. Pearl Harbor is approx. a $12-14 Uber ride and within 15 minutes of the property. The Pride of America is about a $15-20 Uber and for Hawaii this is a deal!!!

At that hotel you could see the black mold in the carpet and on the walls. You can`t see the mold in the Pacific Marina Inn,but with the smell of bleach as we opened the door. They must be trying to hide something. The smell of old hotel was even stronger than the smell of the bleach. They are supposedly in process of renovation of rooms. We were not lucky enough to get a remodeled room. We were only there for two nights or we would have checked into another place.The room is very small. A bathroom so small only fits one person. Paint and plaster cracking and falling off the walls.They have been building a elevator for months and still not even close to completion. They allowed a group of guests to scream and make a lot of commotion for hours. Right up until the pool was closed for the night. These were grown adults and were certainly not act as they were. For the price we paid for two nights it was very disappointing,over three bills! The Chinese restaurant was also a big waste of cash. I do not remember having this bad American /Chinese food for 3 decades. Do not waste your money eating there. This is a very industrial area . No food no stores close by. The only positive we can say is the proximity to the airport. It is close walking distance to the bus routes,only $2.50 for a day pass each person. Take bus 20 or 42 into Waikiki.

Everything else indicates it doesn't care a whit about its guests. Our arrival was greeted with indifference by a front desk clerk who seemed unhappy and distracted, and our room seemed to scream: ""Let's put in a bed and a couple of desks and they'll be content"". No colour or warmth, no bedside table or lamp, no coffee machine. In fact, nothing but a small, spartan room that is perfectly suited to the industrial area in which it is located. But there's wifi and a television, we observed. Ah, but the wifi doesn't work. Surprise, neither does the telly. Morning coffee/breakfast consists of a coffee pot and Cremora in the lobby. Breakfast? Oh, it's not served till the restaurant opens at 9am. Excuse me? An airport hotel that doesn't offer its guests any morsel of food till 9am?? Better pack a muffin or bring something from the airport if you're hoping for anything to eat here. We did try exploring the area for alternatives. Unfortunately the industrial area we explored for more than an hour yielded little more than a fast food joint and a Chinese cafe --hardly the stuff breakfast is made of. And it's certainly not the most scenic area for an early morning jaunt unless you enjoy strolling alongside busy highways. All this may be tolerable when you're paying dirt-cheap, budget pricing. But when you're paying almost $150 dollars for accommodation, I have to say it's pretty pitiful.

As much as I love a game of hide and seek after and 11 hour flight it wasn’t a game I wanted to be playing. Hotel called driver to be told her had gone to the wrong terminal. 1 hr later we arrived at the hotel. Got booked in and asked if they had food this was around 2 in afternoon. No but tonight you can get food in the pub great. So we go to our room get sorted and decide to do some washing, washed clothes and popped them in the dryer after 3 cycles clothes were still wet. When I asked staff, they laughed and said oh no you used the bottom one it plays up!!! They did not offer a complimentary dryer just laughed. So now it’s closer to 6 and we get dressed and head to the ‘pub’ use your imagination with this one! The pub is a room with no aircon so everyone was ridiculously hot and sweating. When we asked for the food menu we were given a dominos pizza menu!!!No food just dominos, in fairness the best part of this hotel was the female bar staff she was great and ended up closing the ‘pub’ as it was too hot!

And, yes, you sometimes can hear planes of various types coming and going. And, also, it is an older property, probably from the 60s or so.But, let's consider the rates: depending on through whom you do your booking and when, it is an inexpensive overnight. And, as it is 10-15 mins - at the most - from the lobby to the terminal, of course there is going to be aircraft noise as well as the light industrial location.I found the staff very pleasant, both front desk and service. I did not experience any rudeness.The room was clean and basic, but had the usual big (for me) screen TV, air con (with a welcome fan option) and a fridge. The ""Shaka Net"" worked pretty well, but did drop out from time to time. There is no charge for it.Because it is so distant from the town, there is a Chinese restaurant serving all day just off the lobby. That restaurant runs also a typical American bar/lounge, dark and air con with the usual booze available. The food is fine and not remarkable. But, so are the prices. It is not fast food.In spite of the photograph at the top of this review, no one mentioned the pool that is available for guests. As well, there is a nook with vending machines, serving up the sort of revolting snacks that the USA people think are so neat. There is an ice machine that works with your room card, just near the vending machines.As I did not want to run to the expense of hiring a car, it was handy to have a ""TheBus"" stop nearby for going to the Ala Moana Mall and Waikiki, the latter to rummage around at Bailey's antiques and vintage ""aloha"" shirts.Remember, though, with TheBus, that you must have the exact change for your travel; they give you a ""transfer"" for changing buses. The Marina desk clerk informed me of those requirements and offered change from his till.I stayed for two nights in early Feb 2017 and, again, for 2 nights just before coming home in late Feb.Finally, in the morning for a couple of hours, there is American style coffee and tea bags (and hot water) available in the lobby if you have to wait for the shuttle that operates 24 hours.I would stay at the Pacific Marina again and recommend it to anyone as a good airport hotel. There seemed to be a number of cars outside the rooms of various makes and vintages, so I suspect locals use it as a motel.Of course, there are better properties, but they are costlier and further away, so the ""Marina"" really is an airport hotel, with a pool thrown in.","Sydney, Australia","grantmD1243GL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",83,4.0

We had just had a 22 hour day due to time zone changes and had flown from London Heathrow to Los Angeles with a 6 hour stop over then our flight to Oahu. When we arrived we were ready to drop. FIrst problem was the telephone number on our receipt was not the correct number for the motel so we had to spend over an hour trying to locate the correct number which meant we wasted time at the airport doing this. Then when we had been given the right number by a help desk at the airport we had to wait about 20 minutes for the bus to arrive. The best way to describe this motel is that its in the middle of an instrustial estate and at the end of the runway. The noise of the planes taking off was really loud. We booked in okay but oh my god when we saw our room. I thought I was in the film bird on a wire with goldie hawn and mel gibson. It was straight from that film. Dated Yes!! dark yes!! then it was a case of what the hell was the noise we could hear, it turned out to be the noise of the water flushing down the pipes each time someone on the block flushed their loo. This continued throught out the night. What next we thought but hey its a tropical island so we needed to switch on the air conditioning again the noise was absolutely horrendous. It was such an old fashioned type of conditioning that it was to loud for you to be able to sleep. Its only one night we told ourselves but try as we may sleep was not be. But we travelled to Kauai the following day thinking oh no we have to stay there again on our way home.The return visit was worse we arrived midday only to be told the resturant isnt open on a monday so we have no where to eat. As we are in the middle of no way we ask where the nearest place to eat is. We were duly given a map and was told its about a 10 minute walk. While the walk is through the industrial estate and the only way I can describe the resturants is to say they were more like transport cafes not good wouldn't go there again.We thought to go to the bar and have a couple of drinks before going to bed this turned out the be the best thing we could have done it was Karoke night and it was very good fun and the bar lady made us some wonderful mia tis.

We weren't expecting too much after reading the Trip Advisor reviews. The lovely photo of the pool and surroundings on Trip Advisor paints a very different image to the over all reality. We intended to stay for 2 nights, but only stayed 1 night. In fact, after arriving, we would have cancelled our reservation had it not meant loosing 1 night's accommodation fee. The surrounding area is appalling! Located in an abandoned (for railway construction the manager informed us) industrial estate there is absolutely nothing appealing at all.The only nearby food was in in a Chinese restaurant attached to the premises. When were walked in to book for dinner we were taken aback by the appearance of the place. It was quite dingy inside and there were boxes for take away stacked around the walls. The tables were covered by stained plastic sheets and it smelt of cooking oil. We went elsewhere by taxi for dinner..Our room had a sitting area with TV and kitchenette and a separate bed room. The appointments were very dated. In spite of No Smoking rules, our room smelt of stale tobacco and was musty. There was a ceiling fan and wall/box type air-conditioner in the bedroom. The air-conditioner was so noisy that we turned it off, but the ceiling fan was fortunately adequate. Sleep quality was poor as we were direcly over the pool and kids were having a wonderful time, late into the night. There was also a continuous hum of background noise - probably from all of the other air-conditioners running all night. Our bed was reasonably comfortable. The bathroom was clean and OK, but clearly old. Apparently, our rooms were upgraded to the second floor instead of the 3rd, as we commented on the lack of an elevator to get our very heavy luggage (SCUBA gear) to our room. We were grateful for thatThe following morning our wives mutinied and refused to stay the second night. The manager was very understanding and helpful when I requested to cancel the second night. He assisted by providing the phone number for the on-line booking agent we used and also spoke to the agent . We received a full credit for the second night. Thanks for your help! Let me make it clear - we aren't snobs and have stayed in some pretty dodgy accommodation in our diving travels, but for our final night in Hawai'i, we wanted something better.

During my first stay the shower dripped loudly and they gave me another room. However, on my return stay the Night Manager said they didn't have my reservation even though I presented a copy showing that I had booked directly with them (Castle Resorts & Hotels). So he said he would give me someone else's room which made me worry about those guests. I was given twin beds rather than the double bed that I had booked. He said my room was on the second floor but even though my room number was only 217 I had to discover for myself that it was in the second building. He said I would have to wait a while for someone to haul my luggage up the stairs so I took it because it was late and I had traveled all the way from London. I was thankful that another guest assisted me with my bag. The Manager's nose kept running and he used his hand several times instead of a tissue without any hand sanitizer gel. Of course, three days later my nose is now running. In the morning the coffee was cold because the pot had not been properly plugged in. I mentioned it to the Morning Manager and I was ignored. I asked her to warm it up in her microwave which she then did. At the same time a local man had cold coffee as well but she apologized to him and said she would get him fresh hot coffee. The rooms were just adequate for a few hours sleep and a shower and the shuttle was great but next time I will pay to have a better experience and not worry that my reservation might get lost.","Hilo, Hawaii","ldaRussello</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hilo, Hawaii</strong>",7,2.0

We had just traveled the Island and were looking for somewhere close to the airport so we didn't have to get up too early to beat the peak hour traffic in the morning. The staff were very friendly and informative of what was available. There is an Asian restaurant on site but not much variety to choose from on the menu. Just a basic meal so if you desire something other than asian food you need to travel elsewhere if you have transport otherwise catch a taxi/Uber. The PMI is located in an industrial area so not much going on at night or during the day, however we still found it excellent accommodation. They have a washing machine and dryer on site as well. The rooms are not too big, with the bathroom consisting of a bar fridge and closet. Keep in mind you are only there overnight so do not expect the world. The free wifi is unsafe so be careful when using it. They have a swimming pool available which is quite nice as well. Overall the Pacific Mariner Inn is highly recommended for travelers ready to fly home and is very close to the airport i.e 10min away.

The free shuttle came promptly, after we called for a pickup from the airport and also took us back to the airport, as soon as we said we were ready to leave, in the evening. With tax, we paid $139.

It is located in an industrial area, with absolutely nothing of interest nearby.There were taxis in the parking lot. We took one to Pearl Harbor, in the interest of saving time and this cost around $19.00, plus tip. However, buses run along a main thoroughfare, just a few blocks away and cost only $2.50 per person. We were told that, because it was a Sunday, the buses only come every 45 minutes, which is why we took a taxi. On the other hand, from Pearl Harbor, we took a bus directly to Waikiki and returned later in the afternoon to the hotel the same way. The bus ride to Waikiki from the hotel takes about a half hour. There is a Chinese restaurant in the hotel, but it did not look inviting and we waited to eat dinner in the airport terminal.For a daytime stopover and a place to leave your bags, take a nap, and freshen up, this place is okay.

They have made some slight in room upgrades from my last visit making the room feel luxurious. The bed was very comfortable with clean sheets and pillow. I Think there is a layer of memory foam or something because every morning I woke up, I felt like I had a good nights rest even after a night out . complimentary coffee or tea and muffins is provided in the lobby.The location of this place is central to places where every visitor goes to. The Ala Moana shopping center ,Ala Moana beach and Waikiki is about 15-20 minutes away, downtown Honolulu where Chinatown and open marketplace is also located is about 10 minutes away. If you like again hunting , the Aloha stadium flea market is 15 minutes.The Northshore is about 30 minutes and the world Famous Kailua Beach and Lanikai Beach is 20-25 minutes away via the H3 freeway that provides a gorgeous view of the Winward ( as locals refer to) side of the island as you exit to what feels like a mile and half of tunnel through the mountains.The hotel has restaurant on site and a cocktail bar that has karaoke nights and seems to be a place to go on the weekends. The property has a well manicured garden and landscape with a pool in the middle of the hotel complex giving the courtyard feel making it feel like a hidden paradise. There is FREE wi-fi and to my surprise I did not have any connection problems with high speed connectivity. The room has a microwave, mini refrigerator, hairdryer and Air conditioning.

No breakfast, but coffee was available in the lobby the morning of departure. The restaurant is Chinese and seems to be popular with locals. My boneless chicken was a bit tough, but my wife's stir-fried veggies were delicious: fresh and crisp in a nice broth. With 4 spring rolls the bill was $21. They don't serve alcohol, so we took our food to the adjacent bar, which on our visit was tended by the very friendly Ross. The ""lounge"" was by no means fancy but served our purpose of having a glass of wine with our meal. A good pour of house white cost $4.

Using Hotwire to book the location for me near the airport, Pacific Marina was the chosen hotel. Luckily, there was a Chinese restaurant on site that was still open when I checked in & had decent food. Loved the mac salad! The hotel is older but the room was fine with 1 queen bed and the bathroom was clean with white towels. There is a hair dryer & fridge in the bathroom. There are 3 floors to the building but my room location was ground floor next to the pool area and being it was the July 4th weekend, I thought it would be noisy but it was quiet. No jet noise either considering how close the hotel is to the airport. The staff was very nice at providing information and the free shuttle to & from the airport is very convenient.

It is located near the airport in a run down industrial estate. We had a person follow us all the way to Waikiki in the middle of the day after checking in. There are no shops nearby. The staff were ordinary. The rooms very old and run down. Bright lights from outside shone through the venation blinds at night. We had to put some towels over the window do darken the room. The air conditioner was very noisy. Full review: Please try to avoid this property. It is in a dangerous area.Shortly after checking in mid afternoon we had a person follow us to a bus stop about 10 min walk from the hotel. We knew where we were going and had a plan. Each time the bus stopped and the door opened this person watched us. Eventually , one time when he wasn't watching we got off and ran. This hotel is about 40min away from Waikiki on TheBus which is the name of the local public bus transport company. Catching TheBus from downtown to the airport hotel you go through many suburbs which look extremely dangerous to wonder in especially at night.. Some of the people who got on our bus were drugged out, homeless, stunk and gazed at you. It was a very uncomfortable felling, also for our lady bus driver. I have never been so scared in my life asa going to this place. You see strange people lurking in the parks while passing through these suburbs.The hotel offers a free shuttle transfer which only takes 10 min. This service is not 24 hr. It was noisy at night with the occasional plane taking off.. The rooms were 70's style, very old with basic facilities. air con very noisy, bright lights from outside shone through our window - we had to put towels over the windows to sleep.. The water pipes were noisy, they waked me up a couple of times during the night when another room is showering in the middle of the night. The staff did not seem all that friendly. There is a Chinese restaurant on site but very dirty looking and uninviting.. We could not get a room for 1 night in the city so this was our only option with a 10am departure the next day.

I initially was on the first floor (room 154) but something was biting me, showed the desk staff the two different small bugs that were on me & he laughed, stated they were from the plants and were harmless. Was moved to an upstairs room (#256). A/C window unit with remote control & TV worked well. The bed was ok. Only used the sink not the shower (all the faucets were corroded) The refrigerator had previous guest hair in it. The ""one"" bottle of shampoo had been opened & used. During check-in wasn't sure how many nights to stay so the front desk staff told me to confirm before 11a.m. the following morning. Went to the front desk @ 7:30a.m. (the following morning) to confirm 2nd night stay and ""Geno"" (who wasn't there during initial check-in told me they had booked that room ""months in advance"" without any eye contact and kicked me out of the Inn. I explained what his co-worker told me the previous day to no avail. Had NO other place to go and Geno could have cared less. (Stressful situation). I was told some Hawaii hotels do not like complaints. The front desk staff wasn't friendly. This was the first time I have ever put a chair to the door for security.

It was dark, and we drove through an airport industrial area to get there, but our first impression was that we were parking in a garden. There were tropical flowers everywhere! A wall of flowers screened our room from the pool area. We had chosen the hotel because it was relatively inexpensive and close to the airport, so our expectations were not high.

Guess what? IT'S NOT WORTH IT!! Pay the little bit extra, stay in Waikiki, and just get up a little earlier the next day to make your flight. The motel is located in an industrial area that feels extremely unsafe, particularly at night. There were a lot of dodgy characters floating around, and we hardly slept because of the noise that people made running around the motel grounds all night. The rooms are uncomfortable, musty and claustrophobic. The motel's claim to fame is that an episode of 'Hawaii 5.0' was filmed there. I haven't seen the episode but I'll bet that it was the location for some scene involving a seedy drug bust. Honestly, the only thing missing from this place was a chalk outline and yellow police tape. The only redeeming feature of this place was Luis, the front desk clerk who entertained us with stories about the film crews who had worked there, and gave us great information on the area to try and make our stay as convenient as possible. Apart from him, everything else about the place was awful.

And to make it worse, when I told a local business associate who works in the area, he told me that the hotel is known for hookers turning tricks in the rooms. And you know, it didn't take me long to spot a few of them outside their rooms between tricks smoking.If this room cost $30/night, I would feel that it was still too high, but at least I'd have an idea of what I was getting into. But through Expedia, this ""2-star"" (omg, who does the ratings...I see Priceline has them as a 1-star) cost me $135/night. Unfortunately, I was making last minute plans on Expedia and with not a lot available in Waikiki, I expanded my search and put an order in for their supersaver discounted room (still at $135/night), and this was the hotel that came up, and at that point it was confirmed and non-refundable.Still, the hotel was SO bad, that with 2 nights remaining which I had prepaid for, I left the hotel and stayed in Waikiki at around $200/night.

This is not a great hotel for overnight or longer stay, however, if you are looking for day room, for few hours, it is still good choice compare to other hotels around the aiprport area...mainly due to cost which is around 70$ for day room and over 100$ for overnight stay. I also checked other hotels in that area for day room only, and their cost was over 100$ and not sure how good those hotels are. You can book this upon arrival from the dedicated telephone kiosk once you come outside the terminal and easily find out the availability and cost. Mind that their transfer may kill your time as it took over 45 minutes for me to find their transfer car which was bit bad experinece as when you are looking for few hours rest, killing almost an hour for waiting transfer...not a good idea. Also be careful, if you have heavy bags and you want to take them in your rooms which was given to you at 1st or 2nd floor...no lift there and you have to sweat yourself.

We had originally booked a package for a hotel in the heart of Waikiki, which was AMAZING!!! We were culture shocked when our trip had to end here, but there were nearly no other vacant hotels unless you wanted to spend over $500 per night. I can agree with the other reviews that if you are on vacation you will want to stay someplace else. Rooms are small and old. The a/c works and you do have a mini fridge. There is a bulky older tv. The lights and faucets are old. There is no in room safe and you dont feel safe sleeping here. The walk to the bus stop is very long and poorly lit at night. There is gang graffitti all around the overpass where the bus stop is located. The nearby gas stations are old and dont carry much. The phone in the room did not make outgoing calls. Some of the staff (mostly the guy with the Asian accent, sorry I dont remember his name) are not welcoming and make you feel like you are burdening them when you ask for stuff, like: getting your room key reset because it looses its code if you get it near your cell phone!! The pool area is kinda pretty, but it looked like the pool was harboring its own life so we never got in. The restaurant was under renovations and there are no decent looking places to eat anywhere close, even fast food (we were told there was a Wendy's about 6 blocks away but after walking 4 or 5 blocks to the bus stop we were usually spent and didnt care to venture into anymore industrial unknown areas). The hotel has some vending machines on site but they were about as pricey as ones you'd find in the Ala Moana Shopping Center, so we just went to Walmart and got lunch meat for dinner and tried to eat while we were out and about during the day. It is in an industrial area so the views are pitiful. However, if your alternative is sleeping on the beach with the vagrants then I would recomend this place, as was the case with us. They did hold our bags for us the day we had to leave so we could go shopping. Also, the housekeeping staff did their job very well. They did their best with what they had to work with. I suppose, overall it was better than sleeping on the beach but IDK, I kinda think the streets in Waikiki seemed safer than being locked in a room at this place.

The Pacific Marina is close to the general aviation side of the airport, and it's inexpensive, so we thought, why not? The rooms are basic and fairly clean, and comfortable enough for one night's rest, we thought. We had a little room right alongside the lovely pool area. There are two long three-story buildings with the pool area right in the middle, and it looks like a lush little tropical jungle. There is the occasional arriving guest or traffic noise, we expected that. My husband usually wears earplugs when we travel but I don't like my ears plugged, so I don't. We turned on the air conditioner and it was noisy enough to drown out the sounds. We had been sleeping peacefully when a group of very loud people (who might have been drinking in the hotel bar) went into the pool area and began laughing and talking loudly. They were swearing, screaming, and moving the furniture around. It was 2:30 am!!!! And they were literally right outside my window!!!! I was so tired, I hoped perhaps they would go to their rooms or maybe security would ask them to quiet down. No WAY!!! They kept going for over an hour. It got so bad that I got up in the dark to push a chair against the (flimsy) door, because they were so intoxicated I thought they might break into my room. It was not a restful night.The next day when we checked out, I asked the desk clerk if there had been any complaints about people at the pool and he said he didn't know, he just started work. No apology. It's a great value if you can sleep through disturbances and don't worry too much about safety.","Kaunakakai, Hawaii","molokaigirl808</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kaunakakai, Hawaii</strong>",87,2.0

Easy check-in with the friendly chap I'd spoken to on the phone. Room (ground floor- off parking lot) not the largest but clean and cool with air con on, although unfortunately we had a constant hum from the aircon vent in the bathroom, even when our aircon was not switched on, which was quite irritating at night, to say the least. On site restaurant/cafe/take away very basic, but good, tasty food (we went with the Korean options, as opposed to burgers, etc) and friendly staff. On site bar also friendly (far from busy) and a pleasant enough way to spend an hour. As noted in other reviews, you really wouldn't want to go wandering about at night, but this is as the hotel is amidst warehouses/industrial buildings giving you nothing to see or do, rather than because it's a scary place to be.On the downside, it is not the quietest place to be at night- between the white noise hum of the aircon (as mentioned), the planes in and out of the nearby airport (not all that frequent overnight, but planes nonetheless) and late night arrivals in the parking lot (cars and voices) I'd recommend ear plugs if you can't request a room away from the car park.The next day staff were happy to keep our bags in the office while we headed into Honolulu (bus stop 5 min walk away) to kill time before our evening flight.

I then asked to move to the outside area by the car parking area, that too was heavily noisy due to people coming out from the bar area located downstairs and loud people and honking of cars. Forget getting a good night's sleep here. Do not bring a family, not recommended. I brought my laptop to use and I could not get it to hit the internet during the full time I was there. Their computer in the lobby was down the entire stay there, but to amazement it was working the last day I was there..but, forget that....they have a charge of .25 cents per minute with a minimum charge of $5.00, that is totally ridiculous. What's up with that??? The best experience that I had was the greeting I received from Bryan Chang and his partner at night. There were very friendly, the others, especially the day shift, NO SMILES. Can't believe that the people that greet you and take your money can't be nice and issue some smiles upon your arrival. They don't appear to want to help with anything and I became afraid to even ask for assistance, I didn't want to ruin my whole day. The final straw was when I came back to my room on a Saturday night. I attempted to park and guess what, all the parking was taken and I finally found a spot about 1/4 mile down the darkened road and left it there all night, now that's pretty scarey to think your card is somewhere parked, and you're thinking is it going to be there in one piece the next day. I stopped into the lobby and asked what was going on and the clerk told me that there was a big party in the bar and all parking was taken up by them. Geez, I'm paying for a room there, shouldn't I have a parking space? They should have informed those people that those spaces were for paying guests, not partying guests.","Denver, Colorado","ColoradoJimmy</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Denver, Colorado</strong>",3,1.0

As it turned out, my visit unintentionally coincided with the timing of the Honolulu Marathon. Therefore, I could not book any of the budget-priced hotels in Waikiki. My choices pretty much came down to something really expensive or... the Pacific Marina Inn. The website makes it look like a decent little property so I figured why not. The stay started out promisingly enough with the complimentary pick-up from the airport (great driver) but went downhill rapidly as we approached the hotel. Looking at the neighborhood, one could be forgiven for thinking that they had been somehow teleported to an industrial park in Oakland, California. The hotel itself is dingy, the pool which looked inviting on the hotel website, looked like something that you wouldn't want to expose your skin to. The room was smallish and barely adequate. A real negative at this hotel is noise from the airport. I have stayed in plenty of airport hotels. They're usually located in such a manner as to avoid as much noise from the runway as possible. Not so with the Pacific Marina Inn. I am an early riser so was in the lobby for complementary coffee before 06:30 in the morning. The thermal pot ran out after I had taken a cup and I informed the desk staff that they were out of coffee. They told me that they only made one pot per morning and that was it! Apart from the coffee incident though, I would have to say the only positive about this hotel is the staff. Everybody I encountered was actually really nice and made you feel welcome.

After thirty minutes waiting, the 'Free Shuttle' collected us from the Airport. Our room was on the ground floor alongside the pool. The first problem we encountered in our small but adequate double bedded room was that after pushing the plug (plunger) into the handbasin to fill it with water, there was no way to release it to drain the remaining water away. The plug (plunger) didn't fit the basin adequately in the first place, which meant that water was constantly emptying. (We informed Management who said they'd have someone check it out!) Our main frustration that we had at this hotel was the refusal to let us put through a necessary 'Reverse Charge' telephone call to New Zealand from either our room or from Reception. We had to use a telephone out in the open area alongside a snack machine, with people walking past talking and laughing loudly - hardly the place to hold a private conversation. I went into the pool for a swim in the evening but found the water positively freezing after such a hot day. After our one night stay, the 'Free Shuttle' meant just that but it wouldn't leave the Hotel until there was a ful complement of passengers! Other than those gripes, the positives are: overall, the Staff were friendly, the bed was clean and comfortable and the inexpensive public transport bus was close by which we caught to Waikiki Beach.

You can spend your savings at the Aloha Stadium flea market.","Wolcottville, Indiana","tjhalsey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wolcottville, Indiana</strong>",8,4.0

However, the hotel/shuttle staff were very friendly and we had a nice quiet stay. The rooms, although smaller than the average hotel room were clean and quiet. And the courtyard's flora was well groomed. We also enjoyed breakfast at the attached restaurant. The P.M.I. is not a place you would want to stay if you are a tourist and planning a multiple night stay. The hotel is situated in a more commercial neighborhood with warehouses and highway as the main attraction. However, the close proximity to the airport and the free shuttle service was the deciding factor for our family. For anyone considering staying at the Best Western near the airport, I might advise against it. That hotel is located at the end of HNL's runway and directly against Nimitz Highway. The noise there is unbeleivable.","Boonville, Missouri","The_Milkmanchris</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boonville, Missouri</strong>",22,4.0

The hotel description made it sound basic but nice, which is all we needed for that night. We stayed there last Saturday evening (10/9) and were horrified at the rooms, the unsavory and unsafe location (this is based on our observations that night and the next morning AND the warnings of the desk clerk when we checked in). Our room (down a few rooms from the office on the main floor) was very small and rundown. It was so moldy smelling that it was disgusting and unhealthy, and the pillows, bed linens and mattress all had the same strong moldy smell. The wallpaper was stained and ripped, and in the bathroom it was stapled onto the wall! The bathroom vent was filthy and rusty, tiles and woodwork old and stained, and the room was loud all night long with truck doors slamming right outside and a decrepit air conditioner in the wall. The unit was incredibly poorly maintained. The restaurant was not open when we arrived (8:30 p.m.) and didn't open in the morning until 8:00 a.m. We had to be picked up by a tour van to the Pearl Harbor memorial at 7:45 a.m., so breakfast had to be a roll and a bad cup of coffee from a gas station a block away. We were not able to change hotels at that late time because the Pearl Harbor tour van had instructions to pick us up at the Pacific Marina Inn so early the next morning, and we did not have a rental car because we had airport shuttle transportation from the hotel. Even if we had been able to change hotels, this hotel has a 72 hour cancellation policy, so we would have had to pay for that room and another for the night. Some day we may laugh about this, but it truly was a nasty place. The website for the hotel was really misleading, and if it had been a woman traveling alone it would have been even a worse situation than we had with two couples. Don't even consider this place!","Minneapolis, Minnesota","SusanA</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Minneapolis, Minnesota</strong>",26,1.0

He got this hotel from the web-site. Even though I live in Hawaii, I did not know where this hotel was. When we got there the lobby itself was appauling. I didn't want to sit on the chairs because they looked dirty. I actually tried to talk him out of getting the hotel. He took it for a couple of nights. When we got to the room, it just didn't even look clean and it was EXTREMELY small. I stood the entire time. The bed spread looked dirty as with the chair that was in the room.  My husband is in Afganistan and will be coming home in a few months and we were looking for a hotel to stay in for a few days to get away from ""military"" living. We also are on a budget, but I can definitely say that this would not be the hotel that we would go to. I'd rather pay more and go somewhere else.","Honolulu, HI","Inspiration35042</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, HI</strong>",2,1.0

All with a smile and great service. Yes, the rooms are small, but they were clean with new linens, bathroom amenities and a hot shower. It was exactly as advertised, and for a great price. I would definitely recommend it for a layover or an inexpensive couple of days in Oahu. And while it is not a resort location, it has a pool with comfortable lounge chairs.
