Soon after,we were in our 21st floor junior suite,absolutely worth the extra money we spent on it. Large and inviting, lots of windows (we could spot Diamond Head and the ocean!!),and enormous walk-in shower and walk-in closet,armchair and a looong sofa … RELAX , here we come!!We also found a pleasant surprise:the WELCOME wishes from the staff (as we were celebrating our 45 wedding anniversary) : towel swans and chocolates made our evening!!It was so convenient to start the day with Vive exceptional buffet breakfast,all you can see in the pictures is true … and you get some more, like those yummy croissants with pineapple and hot dog inside or the soft cheese omelettes. One of the attendant,Kathleen (maybe Kaileen) , was always smiling,while making sure that guests had all they needed,she even helped me with my toasted bread!The lounge had plenty of room for everyone to enjoy breakfast, or, during the day, to relax in an comfy armchair with refreshing flavoured water ...or a cup of complimentary coffee or tea or chamomile. Everything at Vive hotel is well maintained and sparkling clean,all the staff is very committed and myself and husband really want to extend a big THANK YOU to each and everyone.The only (small) flaw is that a couple of days our room was not cleaned. I suspect that this was due to a malfunctioning of the very sophisticated in-room tablet, where you were able to “program” the requested time for your room cleaning. As a matter of fact ,if you were programming the room cleaning at (e.g.) 11:00 AM, at 11:05 a message was automatically generated by the system, informing us that the room was cleaned … but actually it wasn’t. I assume that this message was “marking” the room as “cleaned” in the housekeeping database, so actually they didn’t come to the room anymore. This happened twice, so it’s more than a suspect … no need to say that we avoided to use the tablet the following days and the room was perfectly cleaned per our request. It’s worth to note that, the day after the missed cleaning, we found a nice “Forgive us” card and gift in the room. Agatha ,from housekeeping,always left us fresh towels, all necessary toillet items and a sparkling clean bathroom; bedroom linens were changed every day, all in our room was immaculate!The hotel is just steps away from Waikiki Beach,but at the same time so far from the hustle and bustle of Kalakaua Avenue,it was our little Hawai’ian paradise in the middle of Waikiki.Can I say more ? YES, we are planning to be back asap!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",United States,"LauraDiItaly</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>United States</strong>",325,5.0

Place was well stocked with soap, shampoo, body wash. Check-in was super easy with the room being avail a little earlier than anticipated. They provided cold hand towels and yummy pineapple juice upon check in which was nice after a day of traveling. Our guest services manager, Trey Kelley was very friendly and informative - super helpful and always provided service with a smile! I loved that the hotel had free breakfast with tons of fruit, tea, coffee, pastries. VIVE also provided FREE beach towels, beach mats and beach umbrellas. These factors really made the resort fee worth it even without a pool. The lobby is always stocked with coffee and fruit water as well. We didn't pay for parking but the hotel isn't too far from Ala Wai blvd where where there is free street parking on most days. Also the hotel is in a GREAT location - across the st from a yummy poke bowl spot (Maguro Spot) and delicious Musubi cafe (Musubi Cafe Iyasume). Would 100% stay here again.

Yes, the room is small, but I was only there for shower and sleep, it didn’t bother me at all . All employees are extremely polite and pleasant, no exception.

However, the window sills had holes in them, and didn’t seem quited sealed off. The room came with a small window-mounted a/c unit that was very noisy and left the room damp for the duration of our stay.

Short walk to all the restaurants and malls in Waikiki, as well as to the zoo if you’re heading that way. Very close to bus stops as well, useful when you don’t have a car. On-site parking is available, and the hotel was fine with us parking the car there even after we checked out - we just needed to take the car before 10pm. The hotel offered a complimentary hospitality room for one hour, and that allowed us to re-pack our luggage as well as shower off (we hiked and went to the beach on our last day).

The morning breakfast was impressive, the rooms are tiny but ours did come with a bathtub, which I prefer and was thankful for. The location is in the heart of Waikiki on Kuhio Street, so only a few blocks from the ocean. Our room came with a Queen bed, which seemed really small but cozy. I felt like the hotel was pricey compared to other small hotels close by, but chose it for it's ambiance.

Beds were too soft, rooms are really tiny, bud clean and furnished by modern standards (hotel tablet).

There is an in room fridge but it has a warning inside “ this fridge may not keep food at safe temperatures” they were right, it didn’t. So what’s the purpose of the fridge if it doesn’t refrigerate? Weird. Air conditioning was nice and cold, and easy to operate. Staff brought me an extra blanket because hubby likes the room extra cold. And when he burned himself on a beach day, they brought us extra lotions to soothe his burn. Very nice staff. The pool in the photo does not exist, it belongs to another property but you can see it from upper floors of hotel. This hotel felt like the renovation was rushed and done cheaply, atleast in the rooms. The lobby was very nice and the breakfast everyday was BOMB!

It was honestly the best pineapple juice I ever had and mixed nicely with the bottle of rum I picked up from the ABC store down the block. Be careful when booking from other sites such as trevelocity. Even though you book and pay in full, they still charge a daily fee.

It's definitely showing its age. The lobby seemed newly redone but the corridors and our room were in desperate need of a coat of paint as there were scratches all over the walls. However, everything else was great. The staff are extremely friendly and accommodating. Our room had some spilled popcorn and items left by the previous guest when we arrived. The staff immediately took care of this for us and then left us a bottle of wine with a box of chocolates! The continental breakfast is good value for what you get, and you can borrow as many beach items as you wish. The beach is less than a five minute walk away. And KC the concierge was super friendly and helped us book the Paradise Cove Luau which was a great experience.

However, deluxe continental breakfast is not so deluxe and indeed quite disappointing. Not so much of hot items either. Stayed for 6 days and only had papaya once. Suite size does not appear to be 440 sq ft as suggested and bathrooms are small with no elbow room, and fan. Hotel is surrounded by other buildings so not much of a view either.

If you need to leave before they serve breakfast, like to go to Hanauma bay, you can order a take away breakfast the day before.The only issues I would say is that the downstairs lounge, as beautiful as it is, is not functional as a breakfast space. Additionally, the property know in advance the occupancy so they could provide an overflow for breakfast when the hotel is full, since going up to your tiny room and eating you breakfast on your bed isn't a good option.

It's a pretty basic room, but clean, most important to me. The morning breakfast is great, all you need to get started. The staff are super friendly and helpful, and on our last day, after we checked out at 11am, they offered a complimentary hospitality room where we could return to shower and change before our evening flight. This was excellent. They also offered plenty of beach towels, chairs, mats and boogie boards to take with you to the beach, this was fantastic.One downfall, there isn't alot of storage. We were there for 11 nights, so unpacked, but there are only 2 drawers to store clothes and a few shelves. We hung what we could, and they provided more hangers without a problem, but I would have liked more drawers.Being in downtown Honolulu, we also found it very noisy. I know this is on par with a city, but lots of sirens through the night to be aware of and garbage night is Thursday! Trucks come during th night to collect the big bins..woke me up both Thursdays I was there. The bed was comfy, the pillows, not so much.Overall a good stay for a reasonable price in Honolulu.","Ottawa, Ontario","Vallejos</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ottawa, Ontario</strong>",17,4.0

We stayed 7 days. Let me start by saying this is not a luxury hotel. There are plenty of those along the beach. That being said, it fits the bill in every way possible. My wife and I have traveled all over the world, generally staying in boutique hotels that are highly rated on Tripadvisoir. We believe it is better to spend our money enjoying the country we are in rather then the place we sleep for a few hours. This hotel checked all the boxes and was exactly as reviewed by others. The room is on par with a Holiday Inn or Hilton Garden. Comfortable and clean,. The bed was very comfortable with great pillows. The bathroom was big with a huge shower and real nice towels. That is one of the things that make a hotel for me, The only thing that surprised me was that there was no dresser. There was plenty of room for one. They did have pull out drawers under the bed and a huge walk-in closet. Other than that, I loved everything. about the room. Laying on the bed, I had a good view of Diamond Head and out another window a view to the beach. The Junior suites are very bright and sunny! I highly recommend the upgrade. One thing I did see commented on by other reviewers was the street noise. Yes, you can hear it but it was always quite by 10-11pm. There was zero noise from other guests in the hallways, something that always annoys me.The staff is outstanding in every way, friendly and always willing to help with any request. The free breakfast was OK. Not a lot of hot options. I am a little spoiled having experienced the breakfast spreads in Asia and many places in Europe. But, it really wasn't an issue since we wanted to be hungry for lunch at the incredible number of outstanding restaurants in easy walking distance. Try the Korean BBQ right across the street, it was great! Speaking of walking distance, that is the number one asset of The Vive. It sits smack in the middle of all the action but just far enough away to get away from the throngs and steps from the bus system which we took everywhere around the city. You really don't need a car although we rented one for a day to circle the island. You can get cars thru the hotel or an Enterprise location a couple blocks away at the Hilton.I stayed here on a recommendation from my brother who stayed last year. I would not hesitate to recommend it to others. It's an outstanding value in every way! ",,U8552CWdavec,2,5.0

We chose the Vive for the combination of proximity to Waikiki, the cost and the value. We stayed 4 nights during Thanksgiving and really liked it here. We upgraded a little and got an ocean facing room (though our view was a little limited by the taller buildings between us and the Pacific). Our room was spacious, had a safe, fridge, large bed, 2 chairs and a table in front of the TV, a desk and desk chair, iron and board. Our bathroom had shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, small bars of soap, hairdryer and lotion. Breakfast was included - including fresh fruit, breads and pastries. Hard boiled eggs/bacon and steamed eggs/sausage were served on alternating days. Coffee, teas, OJ and water was in abundance. Not many hotels include breakfast in the rate but Vive does. In fact, I walked into the Sheraton Princess Kaiulani and saw their breakfast buffet was going for 30 per person. The Vive also gives you beach towels, bamboo mats, chairs and umbrellas for the beach with no charge. Check in was easy (front desk person with the tattoos, sorry I didn't get your name). Check out was, as well (thanks Daisy). Breakfast guy hooked me up with a take out box with fruit, croissants and mini cinnamon buns to take to the airport (guy with the moustache and glasses - sorry didn't get your name either). Breakfast lady was nice too - think her name was Atne? Complementary fruit infused water and coffee all day in the dining area. Live music from local musicians a few times a week. Also, no downsides to think of - parking was for a fee but we didnt have a car and no gym but they do offer a day pass for 15 bucks at a partner place. Lastly, no dumb ripoff resort fees that other folks charge nowadays if you book direct with their site. We would definitely choose the Vive again.","New York City, New York","StephenN1694</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",96,5.0

All the staff are great, from front desk, room service to valet. They left us a little treat for our 10 years anniversary, and I just received an email wishing us happy anniversary after our stay.

Amenities:120% happy for what they've offered. Breakfast was great!! We had breakfast there every morning, and my kids love the fresh fruits. We had breakfast there for 7 days straight and still enjoy every single day of it. They are not short of stuff you can use on the beach, from beach towels, mats, umbrellas and chairs. Extra bonus for the kids to have the beach toys and child size boogie boards. On site parking is another bonus, very convenience and don't have to worry about finding parking far from the hotel and walk back with two tired kids. I also enjoy having water/fruit water and coffee all day long. We used the dining area a few times for dinner, as we got some take out and enjoyed having dinner at a comfortable area while it was raining outside. The room we stayed in was excellent too.

There are 2 small drawers under the bed and a clothes closet. What the hotel needs to do is remove the desk and desk chair and put in a dresser with drawers, this would make the room much more functional. - The front desk staff were all very helpful at all times. - The hotel provides a free breakfast each morning which is great, however, they often run out of food items probably because guests over consume. There are so many guests, it is often hard to even find a seat to eat your breakfast at. Also, my big complaint with the breakfast is the staff must put the peanut butter in the fridge? Not sure what else it could be, but someone needs to tell them that peanut butter is not meant to be hard. - Cleaning staff are probably over worked / overwhelmed because my room did not get cleaned for at least 3 days in a row and about 4-5 days of my total two week stay. That alone will earn a bad rating in my book. - The concierge was not overly helpful or knowledgeable. Not sure she is the right fit for the role. Overall, love Waikiki.

The entire customer service aspect was fantastic in general. The lobby was super hip and modern and they had great offerings like towels and beach mats etc. The breakfast was not a complete hot breakfast but certainly wasn't lackluster.The room had so much potential but the overlooked attention to detail really destroyed it and made it feel like a cheap motel that was slapped together. I think we expected a lot more because we opted to pay more to get the junior suite instead of the basic room and it ended up being the same as a basic room in every other hotel. The furniture had scratches and even corners that looked like an angry puppy was gnawing on it for hours. There was dust behind furniture (not just dust but actual thick coats of it). There was a mounted wall lamp above one nightstand but not the other which made it look really bad (clearly intended to have a matching lamp on the other side - which was conveniently randomly located on a different wall in the room completely out of place) and the multi-piece art work hanging directly above the bed was crooked and off-centered. The bathroom was beautiful and high-end but the toilet was beat up with a lot of imperfections making it feel gross. Overall the room had so much potential (and the bed was very comfy) but they dropped the ball with decor and maintenance. If the room quality matched the quality of the bathroom or the hotel's lobby then this place would have been amazing. But when you enter the room the veil is lifted and the reality is revealed.We felt the room was bad enough for us to spend our first night in Waikiki going hotel to hotel to find something better. The Hilton Village was only $15/night more than Vive and Vive isn't on the beach and has no pool/hot tub while Hilton Village is literally the beach and has multiple pools/hot tubs, beachside bars, and is ultimately in its own world. It has everything the Vive has and then some. If Vive was $120 for a basic room and $160 for the suite I wouldn't have been upset. But it was priced as much as some of the best hotels in Waikiki (not counting four seasons/disney/ritz etc) but didn't even come close. I have NEVER checked out of a hotel early in my life until Vive. Their pictures tell a much different story than what you actual get. Don't be fooled by camera tricks that are used to make mediocre places look stunning!

All staff members we interacted with were great - breakfast staff, front desk, valet, housekeeping. While breakfast was good, it quickly felt monotonous and lacked variety. The fruit and croissants were tasty, but the hard boiled eggs and occasional sausage were only okay. Adding some sautéed veggies and scrambled eggs would have been great. However, we always enjoyed having something quick at the hotel for breakfast. If you're looking for a hotel in Waikiki, I'd highly recommend Vive.

It's a great value, and only two blocks to the beach. It's not perfect, but the staff always makes a concerted effort to correct problems and make you happy. This time, when I checked in, I noticed that the carpet to the side of the bed was wet, apparently due to a leak in the wall and floor between the shower and bed area. The staff was quick to change my room. I appreciated the quick response and customer service. Another plus is that the hotel provides you with beach towels, chairs, mats and umbrellas, all at no extra charge. That's a great bonus.Generally, the hotel is very nice, in both guest rooms and in the lobby and breakfast area. However, this is not a new building, and portions of the hallways where the guest rooms are located are open to the outdoors. As a result, weather has effected the carpets, walls, and hallway decor more than you would see in a more traditional hotel where all the hallwyas are internal. It's just harder to maintain, and some of it looks a little shabby.The only other complaint I have is about their breakfast. There's a nice display of fruits and melons, and attempts to provide a nice selection of breads and pastries. However, there are no signs telling you what type of bread and pastries are being served that morning. For example, some pastries have meat inside (surprise!), some have fruit, and you never know what you're getting until you bite into them. Similarly, they often serve bread that looks like it has raisins, but turns out to be dotted with blueberries. Simple signs labeling the food items would be helpful. Also, there is a distinct shortage of hot items providing protein. And, the kitchen is often understaffed in key morning hours..In spite of those shortcomings, I enjoy the hotel, and consider it to be of great value and excellent location. I will stay there again.

My sister and I wanted to do staycation but staying closer to Waikiki for Halloween. Room was decent size for just a party of 2, just city view but our room was facing the streets and other buildings. Can see a glimpse of the beach but mostly just buildings and busy streets. It gets VERY noisy at night, even not on Halloween night with the partying and people hollering. We stayed on 5th floor, think highest is 6th? Got woken up by large trucks cleaning the streets between 4-5am, sirens and car roaring down the streets with their engines and then occasional drinkards screaming. Not very ideal if you have kids or want true peace and quiet, maybe opt for room that isn’t city viewing or beach viewing because to be honest unless you’re stuck indoor all day, beach or city or none wouldn’t matter. It’s the quality of sleep that matters the most when you’re on vacation to rejuvenate for the next day. Pillows and beds were definitely lacking, I meant in terms of pillows x 2 stacked were still laid flat against neck and it just stumps down instead of providing support. Bed was a bit too soft too, also sinks down on lower back. If you’re someone with lower back issue, this may not be the place for you. We’re both in our late 20s weighing mostly close to mid 150s so If we experienced back problems and we didn’t trip or fall or went on excessive hiking trips that predispose our backs for back pain. Bathroom is too small! Enough space for only one person to sit on toilet and get up, cannot have one on toilet and one showering or getting in and out to grab stuff/use mirror. There is also no FAN inside bathroom, so be prepared for your own sake and others because other than A/C, that is a lack of ventilation to air out room/toilet. Only thing plus is breakfast bar with hot food and pastries and fresh fruits! 24 hour access to coffee and tea but they do have juice bar and hardbroiled eggs daily not including hot food with egg omelette and sausages and bacon. They do have board games and card games in the main sitting area so that is also nice If you ended the night early and didn’t want to see just yet while enjoying a cup of tea. Free beach towels and beach chairs etc are nice also. If you’re a Hawaii’s resident you also can use kamaaina discount to waive parking, so free parking daily which is the #1 reason why we chose Vive. It’s my second time returning to this hotel.

We were given a room on the 21st floor with a beautiful view of the mountains. All the staff were amazing. Every single time we arrived back at the hotel we were greeted warmly by the desk staff. We left at 4:30am to make our flight home and check out was so quick, ensuring we had plenty of time to make our flight. Breakfast choices were limited l compared to some other buffet breakfasts we had on our trip but it was plentiful and the food was great. There is no dining area as such so you grab a spot on whatever chair or couch you can find and quite often you may find yourself sharing with other guests, which is a great way to meet people. The hotel does not have lanais, a pool or an actual restaurant on site. I don't think this is a bad thing, it is just something to be aware of.

The location is excellent (apart from there are some apartments across the road the road that appeared to have quite a criminal element - our first night here we saw 8 police cars do a raid which arrested several people - I digress). It is too blocks from the beach and close to the centre of Waikiki so you are never too far from a good restaurant. You should know that street noise is quite audible, although you will get that everywhere in Waikiki. The rooms are a little cramped. They could also have done with a little bit of forethought on the design - I.e. putting the bathroom door by the entrance rather than by the bed, so you don't have to share your private bathroom moments together! However apart from the size it was very clean, comfortable and modern. Breakfast is included and was also fresh and appreciated although not overly varied. The lobby / restaurant is very pretty although not quite enough seating so breakfast is always shared with other people on a table. All things being considered I would have probably given this a 3 start review if it weren't for the nice touches. All day you can help yourself to coffee, tea and fruit water as well as their being a water fountain to fill up your water bottles. The lobby is a great place to sit and they have games, library etc. The staff are very helpful and provide beach equipment which really makes a difference.

We arrived later in the evening after a long flight to a smiling face, welcoming common area, a cool cloth and fresh pineapple juice to help refresh ourselves. We had asked for a ocean view room, which didn't disappoint with a lovely view from the 21st floor. Our room was small, but it doesn't matter, your never in it! The room was clean and a very comfortable bed. It was very quiet, we never heard another guest door, or voice in the halls or from other rooms. Very peaceful! The breakfast was lovely with a variety of pasty items, fresh ripe fruit, protein items, fresh juice, coffee and water, Which is available 24x7. My tip for breakfast, go early and find a nice sitting area, it's not a dining room, and it doesn't need to be, your eating and leaving. This was our first trip to Hawaii, and we were not sure what to expect, I can tell you we could not have asked for a more centrally located, lovely boutique hotel. It met our needs and then some, but to be in walking distance to the beach the way it was ( two small blocks away), and walking the strips in the area were so enjoyable and safe. TiP; Hoku tours ( ask for Cousin Kev as your tour guide), picks up just a block and a half from The Vive at the Hilton, I would suggest this tour company. Pink Line Trolly, is a great a great way to tour some of the area and do some shopping at the local Mall. Check out the Yard House for great service and food (make a reservation). Later evening meals at the Hilton just a few blocks away they have a diner, called M.A.C 24/7. Very good food, and again great service.

From the initial booking to our check out the staff were helpful and friendly, and attended to our every request. We are a couple around our 30's and found the hotel perfect for our needs - we don't often use resort style facilities (pool, spa/massage, etc) so not having those amenities wasn't a problem. We do like having gym access which the hotel doesn't have, but they offer a reduced rate at a fully equipped gym a short walk away). The room is comfortable and enough space for a couple. Valet parking is offered by the hotel if you have a car, but I would suggest looking for cheaper parking close by which is what we did. It's worth checking out the hotel's website and booking directly to avoid paying resort fees, and also for good deals (we took up the book in advance deal). The breakfast is yummy and for us (who were trying to budget a little where we could) was perfect! Fruit and pastries every day, with sausages and eggs added every alternate day. The beach is a super close walk (less than 5 mins) and the first part of the beach that you arrive at is perfect (sandy and not much coral or rocks once in the ocean). The hotel offers free use of beach towels, umbrellas and mats which we used every day. There are also multiple bus stops close to the hotel that connect you with various parts of the island that you may want to be travelling to. All in all a hotel that is perfect if you want a cost effective, well run place to stay, with breakfast and basic hotel services provided - awesome work to all the team at Vive!

There is a message that said something basically confirming the fridge wasn't too cold and to not expect your food to be kept cold. We weren't happy with that. On check in we were offered a kettle which we gladly accepted, surprised that tea and coffee making facilities were not standard. We used the ceramic mugs and tea/coffee from the dining room.As for the dining room, we felt the small coffee tables were not good to eat at. Not enough dining tables. Not sure why they used mostly plastic cutlery, with only a very small amount of metal cutlery available. Its horrible using plastic cutlery and also terribly bad for the environment. They did however provide a great filtered water unit which we used every day and saved buying bottled water. Top points for that.Breakfast was very ordinary. Every second day there was rubbery omelette and hot mini sausages. Otherwise it was cold over boiled hard eggs. There was fresh fruit, bread, muffins and buns. No cereal or yoghurt. The menu repeated every 2 days with only some changes to the type of muffins/buns. Again from an environmental point of view, the little milk containers (about 10grams/0.38oz) should be replaced by fresh milk in jugs.The use of beach mats, boogie boards, umbrellas and towels, again top points for that.Overall a great hotel with top customer service, would definitely consider staying there again, but if there was a comparable hotel that provided a better room fridge, and breakfast experience I would probably switch.","Sydney, Australia","tezmac65</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",0,4.0

Really. It's sad because they start out with two major disadvantages, being the only hotel in sight that has NO balconies, and again for having no in-hotel restaurant. The room was HUGE, roughly the size of a modest studio apartment in floor space and very comfortable. The mattress was new and utterly lovely to sleep on. However, here again, the Vive suffers. I've stayed at better looking Motel 6s. It was utterly lacking in any attempt at decor--and what modern hotel still uses window a/c units? Our 20th storey room had two and yes, they do put out some really cold air, but they aren't equipped for the size of the room they serve, thereby having the guest freeze when in the direct flow of air, but grow sweaty and sticky in the isolated hot spots.We weren't uncomfortable at all, and if you don't care what the room looks like then I can recommend the Vive quite highly due to the superb staff they employ. Any inconvenience you encounter will be swiftly attended to and they are quick with whatever compensation they can think of to make amends for even the slightest impingement on your stay.

The staff were all very friendly and helpful and the facility met my expectations. The only thing that was a major downer was the mattress. It had lost ALL its support as there was a huge dip in the bed from what I can assume is years of usage. My feet were literally higher than the rest of my body and I woke up each morning with an aching back from sleeping so awkwardly. I told this to the lady at the front desk and she was kind enough to take off one of the amenity fees, while also notifying me that they had just received a shipment of new mattresses for this very reason. Other than that, my stay was great! Breakfast included lots of fresh fruit (love), and a variety of breads (no bagels though), hard boiled or scrambled(?) eggs, and sometimes sausage or lunch meat. That said, it would have been nice to have some yogurt, breakfast cereals and oatmeal w/ milk and various toppings as well. Oh, we loved having access to beach towels, chairs, umbrellas and boogie boards too. That really came in handy for time spent at the beach, which was just a short little walk away.

Being two single girls that live on their own we wanted our own space so we booked the Cosmopolitan Family Suite which was fantastic. It was two rooms in one with their own bathrooms so you felt like you had privacy even though you were in the same room. The only suggestion I would make is that there was a sliding door between the rooms so that you could have complete privacy at night while sleeping or when coming out of the bathroom. Otherwise it was perfect.The hotel is a few blocks back from the beach but it was an easy walk and the hotel and they provide towels and umbrellas to take with you which was great.The location was really good and very easy to get around. We walked everywhere from the hotel along the main street and the Pink Line trolley (to get to Ala Moana shopping centre) was really close by if you wanted to get some shopping in. The staff were so lovely and greeted you every time you walked in and out of the hotel and were very helpful if you needed anything. The concierge is only available between 8.00am - 2.00pm which made it hard if you wanted to book something later in the afternoon but when they were there, they were very helpful.A basic/light breakfast is provided in the morning every day until 9.30am which was nice. Lots of delicious fresh fruit and bread. They also have water in the lobby every day filled with flavour (I had a lot of this). There is no pool at this hotel so if this is your thing, I wouldn't stay here. It didn't bother my friend and I though as we wanted to be at the beach. I would recommend this hotel and would definitely stay there again if I was going to Waikiki. It was clean, in a great location, with friendly staff and very reasonably priced.

No children (that I saw). No noisy families. Not a million people. Ahhhh just what I was after. Location was perfect for us. One street back from the hustle and bustle but close enough to be in the hustle and bustle when we wanted to be. Literally a 2 minute walk to the Duke statue and Waikiki Beach. 5 minute walk to the centre of the main street. Victoria (Concierge) provided AMAZING service and nothing was a problem for her to organise. Two lifts. Breakfast is a little different but good enough for us. Fruit/pastries every day and basic hot food every second day. Go elsewhere if you are expecting bacon, pancakes, every type of egg etc. Tea/Coffee/Water available 24 hours. We had the Cosmopolitan Suite (4 people). Two rooms but only divided by a wall. TV and air con in each room. No door to close to separate the rooms but that worked fine for us. Bed was comfy. I had read that air con was noisy and I was really concerned as I am a light sleeper but I didn't think it was noisy at all. Individual bathroom for each room. I had read on here about how friendly the front desk staff were. I found this a bit hit and miss. Either super friendly or little acknowledgement. I would have liked to have heard a ""welcome back"" or ""how was your day?"" upon return. Perhaps it is just different in Hawaii. I'm not saying they were never nice but I felt like I wanted more from them. We loved all the different furniture in the dining area and made it our mission to make sure we sat in a different spot during our stay and we did. Tour vans pick you up at the hotel or outside another hotel close by. Board games and books available. Little beach chairs, boogie boards, umbrellas and towels included but it is part of an 'Amenity fee' that we don't see in Australia. Umbrellas are pretty flimsy and don't hold up well in the breeze. Beach towels aren't like our big beach towels but good enough. I brought my own. As soon as you get organised do yourself a favour and go see Victoria or KC and organise your tours. It is truly the best way to see the island unless you have a car. My best piece of advice, get out of Waikiki. Use it as a base but the true beauty of Hawaii is outside of that concrete jungle.

The staff were very nice and professional. Quick check in and the process was smooth. the entrance lobby was tastefully decorated and welcoming.The negatives:The room was extremely small and cramped with a tiny bathroom in which only literally 1 person could enter the actual bathroom at a time. it resembled more of a small walk-in closet that was converted to fit a sink, tub, and small vanity with a sliding door. There was a loud window a/c unit in the room that was struggling to maintain the room at 70degrees, the bed was ok. However because of the window A/c unit and poor insulation around the windows, i could hear EVERY single sound outside including the countless sirens, and traffic clearly and distinctly. I am not a new to ""city noises"" as i live in Atlanta but this was very loud, sounded as though the window was wide open. Had to call maintenance to fix slow draining tub and sinkIf you plan on driving around Oahu, it will cost you $35/day to park (plus tax) - avg around waikiki i noticed was $30.my biggest issue with this hotel was the $25 ""resort fee"" or ""amenity fee"". its just a cash grab that does not offer value at ALL!!The hotel doe NOT have a :POOLGYMSPARestauarantBarNOTHING most hotels that charge an amenity fee contain.instead of these amenities that people actually will gladly pay for, they offer you:a basic breakfast - fruit, bread and coffee each morning ( after the first day we left the hotel for a real breakfast each morning). and a cheap beach mat and umbrella if you need it. (wifi is included...but is also free at most hotels at this price point)all in all i was extremely disappointed at the size of the room, bathroom, and the lack of ""amenities"" they actually provide.It seems they only added the amenity fee spring of last year. Im guessing because most hotels in Waikiki charge amenity or resort fees..... but those hotels also have ACTUAL AMENITIES.I will be returning back to waikiki next summer for business and i will Definitely NOT be staying at the VIVE. i would much rather find a hotel with actual amenities and central a/c. spent almost $300 in fees/parking.put that into a better hotel",,Cosmopolitan421158,1,3.0

The hotel was clean and modern. The super friendly staff made this place an even better stay. The room was nice and clean and had a modern feel to it. When we checked-in, the hallway solid walls felt a little bland and old due to the the textured walls but they were undergoing some art renos on the walls with some simple tropical art and canvas paintings. The art isn't too busy and definitely gave the place an even more modern feel and for sure made a difference. While the view from our room wasn't an ocean view or a mountain view, it was still breathtaking. There's no ice machine on each level but it was a matter of requesting it on the tablet or going down to front desk and asking for it. Not a biggie. There is always fruit infused ice water by the kitchen area in the lobby and having that water there made us enjoy the stay that much more. Valet was great. Every valet staff was super friendly and helpful. The location is super close to the beach. It's basically a 2 min walk to the beach and right beside a bus stop. The buffet breakfast is great. Yes, while it's mostly just fruit, bread, and some cold cuts, I realized I definitely needed some servings of that for breakfast when my other meals mostly consisted of pretty much just spam, loco moco, shrimps, or malasadas. The croissants they have are also delish.Definitely would come back again and would recommend to friends/family.",,Beefsmoke,1,5.0

Some improvements include the addition of eggs and sausage to the complimentary breakfast and the papaya was impressively ripe every day.Overall the Vive is still a good value but we realized how important genuine customer service is to us and will likely stay somewhere else for our next trip.

We opted for the Vive because it was more within our budget and the reviews are generally good. We knew before we arrived that this hotel would be quite basic compared to the higher end ones.The positives:The hotel is in an excellent location, just a couple of minutes walk to the beach and 10 min walk from the shopping mall/lots of restaurants.The staff at the hotel are welcoming, friendly and very helpful. The hotel lobby is very nice. Air conditioning is great in there, and the 24hr tea, coffee and water is much appreciated. The breakfast seemed good, although we can't really comment as we aren't big breakfast people so just grabbed a few pastries each morning with our coffees.The negatives:Although we have no issue with the room size (we are used to staying in small rooms having stayed in places like NYC where rooms are also tiny there!) I personally found the rooms not very well thought out. For example, we had a chair and an office chair for the desk/table - I don't think 2 chairs in such a small room are necessary when there's such little space to begin with. Just remove the office style chair and there would be more space. The mattresses slide on the bed base so if you move then the mattress moves away from the headboard creating a huge gap.The cleanliness in this hotel isn't to the standard I expected. I just felt like the items in the room and bathroom needed a good clean - e.g dust on lamps, marks on bathroom floor. Additionally there was also an old blood stain on the duvet we had - now this could easily be missed as it was so small but its the attention to detail that is lacking.We personally would not return to Waikiki as we didn't love it, however if you are on a budget then this hotel is okay and has potential to be a lot better if the rooms had a refurb or some redecoration.

Be aware of what this awesome hotel is, and is not so you aren’t surprised. What it is:- One of the least expensive hotels in Waikiki Beach area- The service here is absolutely amazing. Daisy at the front desk is a gem who did everything in her power to make our stay great. Very knowledgeable and super friendly. Every person we encountered - front desk, concierge, bellboy, cleaning staff, breakfast helpers - were all so friendly. We appreciate that and it added to our trip in a very positive way. I am 100% certain that customer satisfaction is extremely high on their priority list. Alex has a great front end staff!- Very chic decor- The free breakfast is definitely as tasty and bountiful as it looks in the pictures! Hot eggs and sausage served every second day, with boiled eggs + cold cut meats served every other day. Great fruit, pastries, bread (including the delish blueberry bread) served every day. Good coffee every day all day and 2 types of fruit-infused water in the afternoon and evening. - We loved the stylish seating/eating area in the lobby!- Great location to the beach - a short 5-7 min saunter!- Lovely beach chairs. I didn’t think I’d like them because they aren’t Tommy Bahama but I actually liked them better because they were lighter to carry and still comfy. Beach towels also included and beach umbrellas are flimsy but better than nothing.- Not only was the room rate extremely inexpensive compared to most, if you book directly with the hotel you save the $25-$40USD ‘resort fee’ per day! Wow!- Our flight home is late tonight, and rather than pay an extra half-day rate for keeping a room which some other resorts do, they have a ‘Courtesy Suite’ which you can book for one hour on the day of your departure at no extra cost! Wow!So this is what Vive Hotel is. Be aware of what this hotel is not. I won’t call these negatives, just the reality of what it doesn’t offer so you aren’t surprised and can make your best decision on where to stay:- No pool or balcony- The rooms (aside from suites) are very small compared to other hotels I’ve stayed in. For example, Hyatt Centric room I’ve stayed in was 330 sq ft compared to the 220 sq ft Cosmopolitan Queen here. Very little room to move around in the room and the bathroom is also small. Although modernized a lot, this building must have been built a long time ago when room sizes were smaller.- No restaurant or bar on site- No ironing board in the cosmo queen rooms- No ice machines on the floors - just call front desk and they bring you a bag of ice (some might see this as a positive)For us, we knew there was no pool or balcony, and traveling on a budget the main thing for us was a clean, comfortable, modern-looking hotel with the free breakfast and close to the amazing Waikiki beach! Because of all the money we saved on the inexpensive room, no resort fee (booking direct), and courtesy suite the final day, we decided to upgrade for our final 4 nights out of 9 to the double-size Lifestyle Junior Suite at a whopping 440 sq ft for only $50USD plus tax more per night. Totally worth it! For a pool, we went to resortpass.com and booked a small cabana for one day at the Hyatt Regency a block away and had a great pool day!Zero regrets for us in booking Vive and we really appreciate the personalized service and all the positives that this hotel offered. Look on their website for discount codes for the best possible rates! Thanks again Vive!","Spruce Grove, Canada","DanfromCan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Spruce Grove, Canada</strong>",91,5.0

Always say hi when you arrive, hold a smile and help out when asked. Now, let’s start with the cons and get them out of the way. 1-Rooms are tiny. Yes, I know the hotel notes the sizes on the website, but they really are small. You’ll be walking over suitcases as there is literally no where to put them. 2-The bed is just ok. The mattress is comfy enough but it just continually slides across the timber bed frame. If you try and sit up, the mattress will move about 4-5inches meaning there is a huge gap between the mattress and bed head. A simple non slip mat under the mattress I assume would help here. 3-Bathroom. Tiny as tiny can be. 4-Cleanliness. The entrance to the hotel is lovely, with a nice clean library/seating area. The rest of the place, not so good. Plenty of dust on our bedside table lamps, and shelves. It’s not bad, it’s just not great. In short, the front of the hotel is great, the rooms are desperate for a refurbishment. Pros. 1-Location. Close to everything you need, the probably best thing about the hotel. 2-Staff. Have been great whenever asked of anything. Always greeted with a smile and a hello. And that’s about it. I feel like the hotel could be so so much better, but I also appreciate this hotel is priced lower than others. Still, it’s not cheap (nothing in Waikiki is) and I probably expected a little more.

I like comfort and usually go for big hotels like Marriott or Sheraton, Hilton, etc, but didn’t want to pay thousands of dollars for a worn down hotel so I found this one that looked decent but it was so much more than that.

It is about a 25 minute walk from the convention center where I had an international meeting but the exercise was good for me. Much love to the people in Hawaii. You have a beautiful spirit and way of relating to people and a great culture. Aloha.",,SynCann,1,5.0

They all go about and beyond to make the guest feel extremely welcomed. Victoria was type notch. She worked extremely hard to get us all of the tours we wanted for a very reasonable price. She was very knowledgeable. She didn’t rush us through the process she took her time and got to know us as individuals. Which really made us feel special. When one of the tours short changed us by not making all the stops they were supposed to she took the time to listen and tried to do everything in her power to make it right for us. We could tell that Customer service was her number one priority. Once Kara’s knew we weren’t happy about one of our tours she stepped right in and did what she needed to do in order to make sure we were happy. It was great to encounter a manager that was hands on with everything. Once KC in Concierge knew we were Veterans she went above and beyond to get us discounts on our tours for being Veterans. Which really meant a lot to us. We also got the privilege of meeting Beverly who switched us out of our 1st room into a bigger more beautiful room and then had the room put together so beautifully for or anniversary. All of the employees just wanted us extremely happy. I was very impressed that all the staff knew us by our name, and went out of there way to greet us and speak to us every single time they saw us. I would take the Vive hotel over the Hilton, Hyatt, Sheraton or any of those other big hotel companies because to them you are just a guest in their large reservation book. But to all the VIVE staff they wanted you to feel comfortable and right at home I felt like I was dealing with my family which was really nice. Victoria and KC should be considered for management as far as I am concerned. Their knowledge and care for the guest are unremarkable. Keep it up Ladies.

We had originally booked it for 7 nights but decided to cancel 2 of the nights and stay at a different hotel. With that being said, you can probably figure out that we didn’t love our overall stay here. We can’t say it was horrible but it certainly didn’t meet our expectations. We booked here having read some good reviews and they certainly had some high points. So let me tell you some of the positives of this hotel. Pros:- Great breakfast served every morning. A very good selection of items such as fruits, eggs and sausages, boiled eggs, bread, and pastries. - Very central to Waikiki - walking distance to the beach, restaurants and shopping.- You can borrow beach towels, mats, boogie boards, and chairs to bring to the beach - We booked through the hotel’s website directly and did not have to pay the resort fee.Now let’s talk about some of the negatives.- Bed/mattress was NOT comfortable. You can tell the minute you lay on the bed that it was a pretty worn out bed ... you pretty much sink in when you lay on it. Pillows were also not comfortable. - Room was a bit run down and was pretty small. It felt like the size of a hotel room in New York City. - The area outside our room was super stuffy. - Rooms weren’t that clean. We noticed that certain areas were very dusty. - Air condition inside the room was very loud and didn’t cool the room down sufficiently.Overall, we think this hotel needs some work. The rooms need some further renovation. We decided to only give this hotel a 2 star because they lacked cleanliness and the comfort factor was missing. We valued a good night’s sleep and this hotel couldn’t deliver that. I guess it all depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re on a budget, we think this hotel may work for you but don’t expect to sleep well.",Canada,"travelfun_111</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canada</strong>",28,2.0

No Gym or Pool yet when you have the Pacific - who needs a Pool - They do give you a 50% Discount at a local Spa / Gym which again is only a short walk to.

Prefer Walk-In Showers which would also eliminate falling down from wet floors stepping up and over to get out of bath tubs. No Complimentary Water - had 2 Bottles in the room at US$1.50 each.

Booked a 10 nights stay and it was wonderful! Upon arrival, we were greeted with warm smile and 2 glasses of fresh pineapple juices! We booked our hotel stay directly with the hotel because the resort fees are waived that way, and you get 50% off valet parking since we rented a car during our stay. One other good thing when booking directly is that you get complimentary room upgrade (if available) automatically. Since this was for our wedding anniversary celebration, the hotel upgraded us to 18 floor corner room with partial ocean view! It was a much bigger room than when we stayed 4 years ago. And when we reached our room, we saw these beautiful towel swans, a box of chocolate, and a card sitting on our bed! That sure was a nice surprise and did make our stay here extra special!!Continental breakfast are served every morning. They alternate each day with limited hot breakfast (sausage and eggs), and than cold deli meat the other day. Fresh fruits such as pineapples, watermelon, cantaloupe, melon are served everyday. Some days you get strawberries and papaya (i love!) too. There are many baked goods such as muffin, breads, etc. Juice, coffee and tea are also available!The location of Vive hotel is excellent. It is literally just steps away from shops, restaurants, and the famous Waikiki Beach. One best thing the hotel offers to guests is the beach gear items you can take with you when you go to the beach such as beach towels, beach mats, beach chairs.Customer service is excellent, all staff are always friendly and ready to help.All in all, a wonderful stay and will come back again for sure the next time we visit Oahu!","Vancouver, Canada","EmilyO647</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

ALSO, they have mats available but they don't have a designated return area so it's constantly being used and not cleaned! GROSS. Imagine baking in the sun and someones sweat is all over the mat and then it just gets used and used with out it being cleaned! How disgusting. We took a sunset yoga session and we both used a mat and placed a beach towel on top. The smell came through the towel. It smelled SO BAD that I didn't want to put my face on the towel.3) there was a mishap with the cleaning but they tried to rectified the situation after I addressed a solution should be made! 4) the daily cleaning is mediocre. We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights. After what seemed to be 3 days into the stay they did not vacuum the carpet! It should be included considering your hotel is at the beach and sand gets everywhere. Also, they didn't have an extra toilet paper roll available after one of the cleanings. The A/C cover fell off and they didn't even try and fix it... after the cleaning it was still on the floor and the floor was dirty as can be. Also, after one of the cleanings they left the dirty towels on the floor so let's just say they are not the most thorough when it comes to the cleaning routine.Improve: 1) designate a return area for mats and ensure its sanitized and cleaned before another guest uses it! 2) if you will promote leave beach umbrellas etc at home because you offer the items at the hotel please make sure it's not broken and so cheap! Also, when being returned it should also be cleaned and ensure it's in working condition to prevent what happened to us. 3) cleaning should include vacuuming the floors daily!4) train your employees to rectify a mistake vs. being told by the guest to come up with a reasonable solution.5) The fruit available during breakfast was not sweet (which was about 1/3 of the spread). My friend had the cantaloupe and it tasted it had gone bad and she mentioned it to an employee. Scones or egg whites would also have been nice option.Overall, if you are on a budget and don't mind a small space and minimal amenities but would like to stay walking distance to the Waikiki beach area then this is a good option. Luckily, for us we were out most of the trip so it wasn't so bad. If you plan on staying in a lot then I'd suggest going elsewhere.I have stayed at the Ashton Waikiki right across the street from the beach. It is slightly more expensive but the rooms are bigger, they have nice restaurants in the same building and the hotel is literally across the street from the beach. I have also stayed at about 3 other hotels in Waikiki and I must say this was the smallest room by far. If Vive improved the areas mentioned above then maybe it would be a bit more worth it.","Los Angeles, California","GretchenTorres10</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",1,3.0

We find most other hotels in Waikiki are kind of old, and this is actually newer than many others. This is more like a business style hotel than a resort, so don’t expect a pool, gym, restaurants, etc. This is not a luxurious hotel but has great value given its location and style.

But we have travelled to Asia often and feel it is not as bad in comparison. Pros: - centrally located in Waikiki, 1 block from Waikiki beach, less than 2-3 minutes walk to the Main Street - Ala Moana/ Beach.- offers complimentary 1 hour room after you check out in case you have a late flight, this is a great feature as a lot people may still go to the beach on their last day, and this allows guests to freshen up before the flight. - In room IPad that allows you to call for room service, get your car, request for services, etc. - 24 hour complimentary coffee, tea, water station and hot water in the lobby. We love the fruit infused water, they often load up with fruits and the water is really refreshing! - there is also an activity/car concierge which we did not use. - if you want to try to Hawaii specialty food - spam w/rice, there is a great one across the street “Musubi Cafe Iyasume” Others: - $30 valet parking per day - $12 resort amenities includes morning continental breakfast (7-9am), beach mat, umbrella, business Center access, wifi and other amenities.

We stayed for about 8 days and was comfortable. The beds were comfortable, and the room nice and clean. This hotel provides a complimentary breakfast that included melon, strawberries, hard boiled eggs, pineapple, and a small assortment of bread rolls. Juice and water also available. Must say the coffee is one of the best I have had anywhere. The water, juice and coffee were available 24/7 which was nice. Another nice perk was the availability of beach towels, umbrellas and mats for the beach. No need to bring your own towels.  The common living room area on the first floor was a nice way to chill, and read a book provided or a board game.  We stayed on the 14th floor on the mountain side of the building. I included a couple of views we had as we were on a corner room.  Details on the room included a nice queen size bed, a nice TV and other amenities such as bath robes, bottled water (which you had to pay for - not sure what that was all about as there was free water access on the first floor) a small fridge, and a personal use computer pad.  Couple of items that were annoying though was the air conditioner and the lack of an ironing board. For a fairly nice hotel, they have used cheap window air conditioners which were very noisy and the wind blowing around this made the room extremely noisy. I had to shut off the air conditioner at night due to the noise, but nothing I could do about the wind. Just had to live with it. Maybe lower profile air conditioners could be used.  Due to the direction of the trade winds, maybe staying in rooms on the other side would help. The staff was great to deal with, and the housekeeping staff made up the room quite nice daily. We rented a car for several days and used the valet service. For $25.00 a day was a bit high but convenient.  All in all, was a great stay.

The lobby was very clean and sleek and most of the interactions for service can be done with a tablet that every room gets. The tablet also had a nice personalized message to whoever is in the room. The staff was very helpful and gives you a cold towel and pineapple juice when you enter. They also provide beach towels, mats, chairs. and umbrellas to all guests. Other nice things about the hotel, they had water, fruit infused water, and coffee available around the clock, which was nice. The deluxe continental breakfast was pretty good, lots of fruits, some cinnamon rolls, and eggs. It could use a little more protein, especially if you have a big day of adventure ahead. Special shout out to Roger/Peter (I thought I heard Peter at first but his name tag said Roger) for being very helpful during check in and check out. One neutral point: The elevator is used for all guests as well as employees. The employees will wait for the next empty elevator to not bother you, but it does cause a little congestion with the elevators and these elevators were a bit slow already as there are only 2 of them for 20ish floors. Nothing horrible or anything, and it does give you a chance to get some water.The only negative point: In the morning, I was usually woken up by honking of cars or the backing up of trucks. Unfortunately the street across from the hotel was being worked on during my stay, and it was rather annoying. Luckily the pillows were thick enough to block the sound, and its not the hotel's fault that road needed to be worked on. I do think this was more of a problem for rooms that face the ocean. I was 19 floors up however, so I imagine the problem is exacerbated on the lower floors.Despite that, this stay was still a 5/5 for me.",,Global07079541423,0,5.0

The lobby and room was very clean, service was attentive and friendly, the breakfast was a nice touch as well as the all day coffee. The only reason I couldn't give 5 stars is because the room was a little small, air conditioner was noisy and there was a window at the end of the hall next to our room with a layer of dust so think, someone wrote their name in it and it was there when we checked in and again when we checked out (#1403). I would think that if there was maid service before we checked in, someone would have noticed it as it's at eye level when you walk down the hall.We were there to celebrate my husbands birthday and we had dinner at Hy's next door.

They are WAY TOO LOUD!! We had a rough time sleeping the first night and just turned them off the second night. Thankfully it wasn't hot to make sleeping uncomfortable but it did get warm.#2 The beds. Hard to say what exactly was wrong with them but they weren't comfortable. They seemed to have hills and valleys or slanting to them.Upon arrival we were greeted warmly/friendly. The Check-in process was quick. The Valet Service person was very friendly and helpful. The only thing was it took a long time to show up so we finally called the Front Desk then he arrived with our luggage. He was very helpful recommending a place for late night ice cream and places to visit. We had a problem with one of the phones in the room and the Maintenance person responded quickly and fixed the issue. The person at the Continental Breakfast was not particularly friendly but we were there for a short time and didn't interact much with her although the question we asked about nuts was answered quickly. All but one of the persons at the Valet Service were super friendly and helpful. The other one.....not so much. When we went to check-out we were asked how our stay was and we informed them of the beds and the air-conditioner and they said they were sorry and would have a Maintenance person look at it and I told them I had seen another review of the air-conditioner being loud and they were told they were going to be fixed but it appears they weren't. What would have been a better solution was to discount our room since our sleep was not good due to the beds and mostly the air-conditioners.

I felt like the front desk person was skeptical of us even though we were perfectly normal guests.Perhaps they’ve had bad experiences with other guests . For longer stays it’s nice they include beach equipment and towels. The only reason for the 4 stars is due to “ not the warmest” reception and only an adequate breakfast buffet.

I've seen some reviews on here complaining about the amenity fees but let me tell you, the $12 daily charge at Vive is incredibly affordable compared to most hotels in Honolulu and they were certainly up front with me about them. Also, if you really hate the amenity fees that much, book your room on their site directly and they'll waive the fees. Problem solved. Pro tip: I recommend doing your research on the place you plan to stay so that various fees won't catch you off guard.My room was satisfactory in size. I had the Cosmopolitan Queen and I found the bed to be quite comfortable. While it is true that the A/C unit could be a lot quieter, I didn't have an issue falling asleep. However, more sensitive/light sleepers might have a problem with this. There is also a lot of street noise when staying at the Vive but I have a newsflash for you all; you're staying in Waikiki! It is essentially the party town of Hawaii and yeah, it's an up-all-night area so you can expect to hear people having a good time outside, buses coming and going, and the occasional homeless person screaming for no reason. It comes with the territory. Again, however, I didn't have a problem sleeping with the window shut but the more sensitive sleepers may have an issue. If you're sensitive to noise, then get a hotel on the outskirts of Waikiki. The only problem I had with my room was in the bathroom. They really need a vent/fan system in the bathroom and the shower head in my room would spray everywhere, including over the curtain, when in use. I had to use a towel to mop up the water on the floor. The rooms have an info card in them that state the room will only be cleaned if you request it as an economical measure. Again, I like this style. The room comes with a tablet that you can use for various things such as ordering room-service (the Vive apparently has a system where restaurants in the area can delivery to the hotel for you), as well as request more towels, toiletries, etc. The tablet is where you also schedule your room to be cleaned. I love this because I hate coming back from exploring and finding my room in use by the the cleaning staff. The tablet let me set the time I knew I'd be away and by the time I got back, the room was in order. The location is more than ideal. You can walk to the beach in less than five minutes! Part of that $12 amenity fee goes towards the breakfast provided every morning, as well as free use of beach towels, body boards, beach chairs, etc. I found that service to be incredibly useful and it really made it so that my girlfriend and I didn't have to worry about packing those items thus taking up more space. Now about that breakfast, it's not a five-star hotel people so stop expecting as much. The Vive does provide a fine selection of fruits and breads, as well as ham, turkey and hard boiled eggs. You can get water, coffee and pineapple juice to drink. For me, it worked out just fine because I prefer lighter breakfasts. I would definitely recommend the Vive, except for some of your more high-maintenance types, and I would most certainly stay at the Vive again in the future if I'm looking to stay in Waikiki.","Aurora, Colorado","TravelConfidential</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Aurora, Colorado</strong>",11,4.0

The front desk staff are great, offering a welcome drink and cool towel on arrival. They were able to arrange an early check in to our room we appreciated! Knowing it was our wedding trip, they had a cute arrangement of towels folded into heart shaped swans, with a box of chocolates on our bed. There was a really nice view to the ocean and diamond head from the lanai outside our door. We were given a high level 17 room, which had nice views to the mountains and diamond head. The only negative as other guests have mentioned is that the room is tiny. Not a huge amount of space around your bed, but we still managed to find space to lay out our big suitcases. We only stayed a couple nights and mostly out all day to return to sleep, so it was sufficient for us. And it was clean and neat. They have 24 hour tea/coffee in the lobby with included breakfasts each day. There is fresh fruit available for the gluten-free eaters. The hotel is a few minutes easy walk straight down to the Dukes statue on the beach. If you are catching buses, there is a bus stop not far from the hotel door which is handy. Trolley stop just the next block down. All in all, the only negative was the size of the room, with no in-room facilities such as tea/coffee maker. But with all the cafes/restaurants at your door step, it’s not a huge deal if you are happy to eat out. If you would prefer to be able to cook some of your own meals in, (with Food Panty a minutes walk away to buy groceries) then I would recommend you stay elsewhere.

You will not be charged the daily amenity fee and parking will be half price. That's about $25 a day saved there! They only offer valet parking and the height of the garage is only 6 feet so if you have a high SUV or van, be warned. We found this out with our rental van, thankfully the rental company had a lower van we could use.The hotel is in a great location, just 3 blocks from Waikiki Beach. Everything you need is close by.The hotel offers free wi-fi, a free continental breakfast with pineapple juice, filtered water, tea, coffee, assorted fruits, cold cuts, boiled eggs, and assorted breads & buns. The lobby/eating area is large but with few tables and chairs that are suited to eating - most are couches with side tables so you have to eat hunched over.The lobby had a cute library and lots of board games you could borrow, there was a small gift shop too.The hotel is wheelchair accessible but has steps to the lobby - to enter you need to walk around the side of the building where there is a ramp into the back of the lobby. Not far to go.We had a wheelchair accessible room which is a corner room with a seating area, king sized bed, desk, safe, robes (slippers on request), 2 air conditioning units and a wheelchair accessible bathroom with wheel in shower. There are few wall shelves in the bathroom but there was a standing basket type shelf so there was plenty of space to store your toiletries.The closet in the room was big and the bed had 2 huge drawers under it, lots of room for your stuff.The bed was very comfortable with feather pillows which I like.We were on the 9th floor and there was a lot of noise from the street. I don't believe the windows have any sound proofing at all, since we could hear all the traffic noise and even a child crying at one point! Being from a cold climate I am used to double paned windows that keep out the noise, but there were just single paned windows. At night the noise of the air conditioning acted as white noise and kept most of the street noise from bothering us (except at 5:20 am when I could hear trucks beeping as they backed up, and there was some construction on our street which started very early).There's no pool, no spa, no courtyard, no gym, so I guess that's why this hotel is priced cheaper than other hotels in the area. But we weren't looking for any of these amenities so the hotel suited us just fine.The hotel will lend you beach chairs, umbrellas, beach mats and towels free of charge. Wonderful! We took advantage of that for an afternoon at the beach.I wasn't quite sure of the function of the tablets, most anything we wanted to know we looked up on our phones or computer, maybe not everyone travels with that but I would think this day and age they do. Sometimes it would be off and since that is the only clock in the room, it was a hassle to try and get it to come back on.Employees were very friendly and helpful and I would definitely stay here again.","St. John's, Canada","Karen C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>St. John's, Canada</strong>",106,4.0

Upon entry the lobby is clean and inviting with comfortable chairs and couches throughout. I was presented with a cold towel to wipe my face and a cold glass of pineapple juice - refreshing and delish. Staff was pleasant and accommodating. I was surprised at the size of the room - small but for a traveler of 1 just enuff. Continental breakfast daily but needs more variety. Lots of things to do is in walking distance.

The breakfast room was the lobby with a variety of seating arrangements, and though it sometime got full, you can usually find a comfortable seat to suit your preferences (being a retired spy, I usually took the seat in the corner with my back to the wall). The coffee was very good and there was a variety of breads, buns, cold meats and fruits that changed a little bit every day -- nothing too exciting, but then we never got tired of it either.

Shout out to him!So the second time we came back, when we actually had the right reservation dates, we were welcomed equally friendly and attentively, checked-in by Beverly I believe. She was fantastic, informative and kind. The room was as we requested on a higher floor i.e. 20th, looved the view! The hotel even attended to our honeymoon trip by treating us some complementary chocolates upon arrival in the room. Functional space, bathroom was slightly small but worked very well, clean. Bed was very comfy. In the evening there was an ukulele up-and-coming artist who played for the guests in the lobby - beautiful touch! He was amazing! Breakfast in the morning was good (as American continental breakfast goes ;) ). During the day we could borrow beach towels and umbrella which was lovely.

The bed was really comfortable once we rotated the mattress so that the head that everyone sits on was at our feet, leaving a cushiony firm mattress under our bodies. On first try it seems very squishy but still supports in all the right places. There were a few hairs in the drawers under the beds and bathtub and a couple of small stains on two towels and a robe, hence the lower cleanliness score. Otherwise, very clean and nice. The worst bit was the allergic reaction to the towels. We inquired specifically before booking and were told that scent free detergent was used for all the linens. I used a washcloth to put some ice on my forehead for a headache and used a towel when getting out of the bath the first night. My chest and neck (where I used the towel before I realized it smelled) turned red and irritated. And my eye swelled up till I could hardly see out of it. Other than that we had a lovely stay and thoroughly enjoyed it. Just be cautious if you have severe allergies.If you're there on a Tues or Thurs evening visit Karissa of Henna Happens at the Hyatt farmers market - fabulous!Thanks to all the wonderful staff!","Honolulu, Hawaii","Adventure64726893929</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",1,4.0

Our room was very quiet, spacious, a good-sized TV with plenty of channels, WiFi running at about 9 Mbps for downloads and the complimentary breakfast buffet is a nice touch. It is a very short stroll from the hotel to either the beach or the main Strip in Waikiki. There are no verandas (Lanai or Porch) with the rooms but that just means you need to find a bar overlooking the beach to enjoy the sunset instead. My only suggestion to management is to consider putting a small electric kettle/jug in the room as having to attend the lounge on the ground floor for hot water is a little bit of an inconvenience. Finally, plenty of people complain about the air-conditioners being noisy however for us they were just white noise that helped mask any external noise from the outside. We would certainly stay at the Vive Hotel again.","Brisbane, Australia","BrisbaneSmiley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",39,5.0

You either have to squeeze in next to service personnel carrying cleaning products or you are forced to endure multiple stops until you make it to the lobby. Also, on the upper floors there is no indicator stating the level the elevator is currently located at, therefore making the (up to 10 minute) wait for an elevator seem endless.The cleaning staff refrains from doing an sufficient job (or any job at all) unless you leave a few dollars lying around in your room for them - and even then their work is hardly worth a single penny.The extremly small bathroom (which cannot be locked) has not been noticeable cleaned once during our 7 day stay.The biggest issue we had with the hotel was the breakfast. It mostly consisted of a bunch of cheap and tasteless items supposed to resemble toast and different kinds of buns. To add some taste, one could only choose between strawberry jam and peanut butter. The coffe tasted awful and had such a high temperature that it could not properly be filled into the provided paper cups. The only thing off the breakfast buffet which could be considered edible was a variety of fruits.Also, if you enjoy a good night's sleep in a temperature regulated room this hotel is not for you. The air conditioning is loud and if you happen to stand directly in front of it you can kind of smell that the last time it has been cleaned was probably back when it was set up.All in all we would not recommend this hotel.

(I hope he finally got to cook his turkey for his family) I really like the convenience of the in-room tablet to arrange room cleaning or valet. Breakfast each morning wasn’t too special and it does get quite busy but it was very convenient to start the day with. On my previous trip to Hawaii I had stayed at the Hilton village and to be honest I would prefer to come back to Vive Hotel as the staff are far more personable and friendly. Also the location for Vive is fantastic as it’s near the main shopping strips and beach. I’ll definitely come back to stay at Vive Hotel!,"Melbourne, Australia","Pheng-uin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",1,5.0

The staff were always friendly and helpful, arranging everything we needed, and nothing was too much trouble. The room is slightly small, but it's comfortable for two people, and very well maintained.The only downside was the bed being super soft (but that's a personal preference - I like firmer beds) and the wind rushing past the window makes a reasonable amount of noise. (But the wind is just the weather in Honolulu at that time of the year, and being so high up that's to be expected!)Overall, a great value place to stay, with super friendly staff and convenient to everything you need to do in Waikiki.","Sydney, Australia","KatieA978</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",13,4.0

There is also a supermarket about 2mins away to buy water etc.Breakfast was basic by European standards (1 type of jam, no cheese/meats etc.) although the fresh fruit was nice. The breakfast area is small and more of a lounge area with small and low tables which makes eating difficult. We usually went out for breakfast.

If you're looking for a no-frills place to stay then you'll be happy here. Bottom line: no pool, workout room, or restaurant; small basic rooms, good service. Staff was friendly and helpful. They asked at check-in if we were celebrating anything so I told them it was my birthday during our stay. The next day they sent up some snacks with a happy birthday greeting. The room is small, almost Manhattan small. There was no dresser for clothes, just a couple small shelves of the nightstands. Eventually we discovered two drawers in the bed frame. A little awkward but we just kept our clothes in our suitcases. The bathroom is also small with a sliding door. The water pressure is great and hot water was quick to arrive, even on the 18th floor. The bed was pretty comfortable which is good since we both caught colds and ended up spending a lot more time in the room than we anticipated. The AC is a window unit which is typically loud but did the job. There are only two elevators which meant we often had to wait a few minutes. The continental breakfast is nice with several pastry and bread selections, fresh fruit, and hard boiled eggs. Seating in the lobby was sometimes scarce but we managed to find seats all but one day. The location is good, only three blocks to Waikiki/Kuhio Beach. There are many dining options nearby including Hula Dog and Marukame Udon. We didn't plan on renting a car but ended up getting one for almost a full week. Valet parking is cheaper than other hotels in the area and we never waited more than a few minutes for the car.

I was there for a good while and interacted with many staff and each and every one of them was gracious, friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet is more than decent (though no eggs cooked to oder, etc.) and is continually restocked, worth $15 per person, I'd say. Breakfast area is the lobby and it's perfect for that with miscellaneous tables and chairs such that you can be left alone or you can chat will other guests, which I did on several occasions. And it's available for 2 1/2 hours. A nice mix of American, European and Asian tourists. At $25 for guests parking is a bargain for this part of Waikiki. No pool (I saw hardly anyone in a pool at any hotel and lots of people in the ocean), no restaurant but there are lots within blocks including the fine Japanese Jin Roku across the street), and the only central air is in the lobby; that's the main drawback as the rooms are cooled by window units which sound like window units.

I'm young, but I had some trouble falling asleep and had a back-ache each time I woke up. Definitely recommend to management to upgrade them as soon as possible. The rooms are otherwise very nice. Plenty of space for two. A couple other notes to be aware of:- the hairdryers aren't great, so bring your own- the iron is very bad; would be nice to see Vive upgrade those too- the air conditioning is provided by two window box units; they do an ok job, but cannot be set below 76 degrees F; it's hard for us to sleep in a room that warm, so be aware of that if you're the same; they also don't do much for humidity, which meant bathing suits and towels take a couple days to dryI'd overall recommend Vive very much on general quality and price, as long as you're willing to bend in a few smaller items.

For American standards, this was pretty surprising. We had two big suitcases and there was no where to put them other than on the floor. There was not enough cupboard space / hanging space to unpack so we had to keep stepping over and around the suitcases. The room was clean and nicely furnished. The queen bed was comfortable. We had an air conditioning unit which was great, although it made noises at intermittent times. No big deal though.The hotel provides a continental breakfast. They describe it as deluxe but it was pretty standard, nice to have fresh fruit. The hotel is NOT set up for this though. There are a few seats around the breakfast bar but not enough to accommodate the morning rush. A lot of guests apparently take their food up to their rooms because of this. It is a nice gesture to offer breakfast, but if you can't actually seat your residents then I personally would rather not get breakfast, pay less on the daily rate and go elsewhere.The hotel does provide towels and mats for the beach which is a nice add-on.On our welcome sheet, it was noted that we could stream music through the in-room tablet. We like to listen to music instead of watch TV, so I thought it would be nice to listen to spotify (which is one of the music services they outline on the sheet). I searched everywhere on the tablet for the app but it was not there, neither were any of the other music apps that were mentioned. I rang down to housekeeping, and they sent up tech support. He was stumped! He didn't know how to get the apps onto the tablet and wasn't sure why they weren't pre-installed. He said in the time he's been working there that he's never been asked to do this for anyone. I found this very odd as it seemed to be one of the main perks to having the tablet, certainly from the info sheet that they provided, this was a big deal for them. It felt like this hotel was over-promising and under-delivering a lot. Again, I would rather pay less daily rate with less gimmicks (that clearly they are struggling to deliver on). He said he would ring the service provider to find out, and I stupidly assumed that he might get back to me with a workaround. I never heard from him again.Everything was adequate and clean (which earns it extra points) but I don't think it was good value for money for what you were getting. I would most likely not stay here again.","New York City, New York","therealmckay</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>New York City, New York</strong>",14,3.0

Kalakaua is the 1st main strip which goes along the edge of the beach and has all the shops is only 1-2 blocks away. You can get to the beach within minutes. The other great things about this hotel including WATER at all times. We never had to buy any water, as we brought our own water bottles. They also provide coffee and tea all day. There is a pretty decent breakfast with some pastries, toast, an assortment of fruit, and boiled eggs. You can also borrow body boards, beach chairs, mats, umbrellas and towels. There is free strong wifi in the rooms and a tablet is included in each room. These are all great services that are included in your $12 per night resort fee per room. Yes, you do have to pay it per night, but you get quite a bit of tangible things. We never rented a car, so didn't have to deal with the expensive parking which I believe is $35 self-park. Parking is very limited in Waikiki and having to pay for it is very expensive, so avoid it at all costs. Rent a car for the day and then drop-it with keydrop when you're done after-hours. We did this at Enterprise and it was awesome. Back to the hotel. They don't have a pool, but why would you want to hang out at the pool, if you can just go over to the beach?! We loved this hotel and how convenient and close it was to everything. All of the staff were wonderful to us. It made our stay in Hawaii so pleasant. The only thing I suppose is that I wish the rooms were slightly larger, but I guess there isn't much room in Waikiki. Being used to staying in larger rooms in California, I was a bit taken back by how small our room was, especially with a toddler. It reminded me more of our hotel room on a cruise ship or in Japan, where everything is crazy small. No matter though, we spent the majority of our time out on the streets and beaches of Waikiki.

While the rooms are a little on the smaller side I couldn’t complain with the complimentary breakfast, the free valet service, and all the additional beach ammenities like towels, chairs, umbrellas, etc; and for the price you’re paying it’s a good deal! Halfway through my trip there was an issue with my AC unit, I talked with Preston at the front desk and he moved me into a suite until that room was reserved again. Preston and the rest of staff were always so kind and making sure I was being taken care of and enjoying my stay. Every morning I was greeted by Romeo to pick up my car, he always had a big smile on his face and suggestions and tips about life on the island. I was so thankful for him and all his help and advice! Overall the location is pretty great too, you’re about two blocks from the main strip of beaches in Waikiki and a few blocks east of some of the bigger shopping areas. If you’re looking to stay at a more affordable hotel with great quality service in Waikiki this is a great choice.",,Brittney G,1,5.0

Every year my husband and I get away to Honolulu just to have a few days to ourselves. Well this year we were also preparing for me to retire in the next four months. Instead of canceling or trip we decided to cut back on expenses. I knew when I booked the hotel I wasn't reserving a 5 star posh hotel. I just wanted clean and comfortable. I started off okay everything was as promised from the fresh juice at check in to friendly customer service with front desk staff. We were assigned to room 1208 with a decent view of the ocean. Cleanliness isn't one of this hotel's strengths. The shower was large but the drain looks as though it hasn't been cleaned in years. There was hair everywhere, television (yes the t.v.) was filthy and I am not sure what we were breathing in because the vents were disgusting. Breakfast was as promised and neatly arranged but no meats. The second day we went out on our island adventure and returned at 4:30 and found that our room had not been cleaned. Strange, I've never experienced this before and after consulting with the front desk this was standard. It was not a lie our room was poorly cleaned around 5 p.m. the entire week. It was inconvenient. There are window unit air conditioners which are loud but we could still sleep. On the fourth night we were woken up to a fire alarm around 4 am. After running down the 12 flight of stairs many guests appeared angry because they were told to return to their rooms while hotel staff were investigating. We were told they believed someone was smoking on the 9th floor after waiting for 35 minutes. No fire truck showed up but we were told to return to our rooms. Of course the elevators were locked so up the stairs we climbed. The following day we were greeted with another alarm early in the afternoon. No explanation. I was frustrated. The hotel promised juice, coffee and water were available daily free of charge but water was not available after the 3rd day throughout the day. It's hot in Hawaii, hydration is important. One night I drank one of the $1.50 bottles in our room until we could purchase water. At check out I was charged for 3 bottles instead of 1. By this time I just wanted to check out of there. The valet staff were extremely nice (Romero was very cool and always greeted me by my name). I don't recommend this hotel if you are looking to relax but if you just need a place to sleep it is an affordable option.","San Diego, California","KStarks2018</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Diego, California</strong>",0,2.0

The room was simply for sleeping with two rooms with double beds and two bathrooms. For the good value we did trade not having a balcony nor amenities such as a pool (with a pool at home not such a big deal for us) and gym. The daily breakfast was simple - bread, pastries and lovely fresh fruit plus juice and tea/coffee. I noted that some people supplemented it a little with stuff they bought but for us it hit the spot every morning. All day tea/coffee was available as well as refreshing water.

It was by far the best value on Waikiki, and I would happily return in the future. The location and amenities here are outstanding! Vive is not a resort or a chain hotel. As long as you read the information on their website carefully, you will not be disappointed. The rooms are clean and neutral with no frills. After reading reviews on Trip Advisor, I decided to book the Jr. Suite. It was marginally more expensive than the regular room and felt like a normal sized room. I wasn’t expecting a view at all, but wow— we could see everything from the 20th floor including Diamondhead and the ocean. We were able to book the Jr. Suite + convertible rental for $228/night with no amenity fee by booking direct. Parking is valet only and $25/day. Vive is so conveniently located in Honolulu that we didn’t NEED the car at all, but I’m so glad we had it to explore the entire island. My favorite part about Vive is that everything we needed was included with no additional fees. We had a light breakfast at the hotel every morning (fruit, carbs, juice, coffee) that was perfect before hitting the beach. Speaking of which, it’s an easy 5 minute walk to the ocean. Vive has beach mats, chairs, umbrellas, boogie boards, and towels that you can borrow for free! This hotel is definitely worth your consideration. Mahalo, Vive, for a great stay in Waikiki!

The cleaning staff was not cleaning the bathrooms. When a friendly note was left including the on-going tips we were leaving, to ask them to clean the bathroom please, we came back to find instead they had soiled the toilet including the toilet lid which they left up, so to put the lid down you were forced to touch the soiled area. The shower had not been scrubbed, and there was new evidence that the counter had not only not been cleaned, it was in worse shape. Pictures were taken which document all of this. I personally spent 2 hours cleaning the entire bathroom with soft scrub on my vacation, and then we left the “guest at rest” sign up, so we could clean the room ourselves the rest of the week. They also would turn the air conditioners down so low and leave them there, that when we'd enter the room after they ""cleaned"" it was like entering a freezer unit. The organization and communication of desk staff could be challenging. Examples:• We asked about a shuttle service to the Aloha Stadium Flea Market, they advised us one was on the way. The shuttle they actually meant was the airporter shuttle that was making numerous stops around Waikiki prior to going to the airport, and we were to be dropped of on the way back at the stadium. This wasn’t the 20 minute shuttle we had thought it was going to be• We upgraded our room the first night, because the original room we booked was too small to be comfortable in (barely larger than the bed itself) We paid the upgrade fees, but they shorted us a day when they updated the reservation, so we returned from an outing to a locked door, and our key cards wouldn’t work.

The rooms look small at first, but are very comfortable with well functioning air conditioning. Based on my experience, having good air conditioning in an affordable hotel in Waikiki is an absolute luxury. The staff is friendly and helpful. The hotel even has a dedicated concierge, Kacy. She is a mohawk sporting, absolute expert of the island. The valets like Ryan and Romeo are friendly and fast. The free breakfast is better than anything you will get in any other affordable hotel. Sick of the powdered eggs, sausage discs, waffle makers and crumby coffee?

I highly recommend this hotel for couples, families with children who are preteen or older, and young adults looking for a cheap but nice stay. Location: The hotel is located about 5 minutes from Waikiki Beach. There is an ABC store 1 block away. There are several places to eat within a 10 minute walking distance from the hotel. My group and I ate at a taco truck next to the hotel, I highly recommend it! In addition to the variety of restaurants there are several shopping locations within a 15 - 20 minute walk. Also if you are using public transportation (the bus) there is a stop that goes to all the tourist attractions within 1-2 minute walking distance of the hotel. Hotel Room/lobby:The hotel itself is very up to date. Our room had a tablet and Television and was very clean. The housekeeping did a very good job at changing the towels, taking the trash and even went as far as making a towel animal on our bed!! The lobby has several seating areas a few tables to lounge around in. They also have an amazing book collection where you can borrow a book read it and return it back to the book shelf when you finish. They have several family friend board games in the lobby that were lots of fun and a good way to relax in the evening. Not only do they provide these free activities you can also use their beach towels, mats, beach umbrellas, and boogie boards!!! ( which saves money buying any and space in your luggage) Staff: The entire environment of this hotel is friendly relaxing and happy. When you check in they provide you with cool towels and a glass of fresh pineapple juice. (YUM!) They constantly are asking how your day is, if you need any beach towels, simply saying “Hello” ir asking how your day was. On numerous occasions I saw staff members at the computer helping couples/ families/ individuas plan attractions for the day. They seem to genuinely want to help and make this a relaxing fun vacation. **on our final day we checked out of the hotel and hiked “the stairway to heaven” (HIGHLY RECOMENDED) when we returned to our hotel we were full of mud and we’re planning on changing and flying home the way we were. (I know gross right?) well the manager kindly offer us to use a vacant room free of charge for 2 hours to shower and clean up before heading home. We were so grateful at the generosity and kindness of the offer.**Breakfast:The breakfast bar I believe started at 7:00 am and ended at 9:30am (I could be wrong). They had a verity if fresh cut fruit (watermelon, pineapple, strawberry, oranges, cantaloupe, melon). They also had hard boiled eggs. Their were several pastries (sweet breads, muffins, bread with berries) they also had regular bread you could toast and put butter, Jelly, and peanut butter. They have fresh pineapple juice, hot tea, coffee (decaf as well) and fresh water that is infused with fresh fruit. Also if you do not make early because you want to relax and sleep in no worries on missing out because there was constantly staff members taking dishes and bringing out more platters of food so the breakfast bar was full. Cons: There was no pool so if you like to lay by the pool or have young children that don’t do well at the beach because of currents and prefer to swim at a pool i would consider this. Also their parking garage is Valet only and I believe is $25 a day. Other than they there was no problems! And I highly recommend staying here! This picture is our hotel view:)",,ally y,1,5.0

The towel swan and chocolates on the bed upon arrival were a nice welcome. We had a minor issue with the shower which was resolved very quickly.

It’s a nice continental breakfast spread (don’t expect any hot options!). Definitely try the blueberry bread! It was delicious. The only downfall was the concierge left fairly early and we were never able to ask for advice because we were gone before he/she arrived and when we got back it was after 5 and they were already gone. The beds were very comfortable and provided a good nights sleep. We got a larger room which had a nice big closet.

The hotel was quiet and comfortable, but still in the middle of the action - only a few blocks from the beach. This is the perfect place to stay if you want a small, cozy room to unwind after a day of exploring. It's not a resort, it doesn't have a pool and the rooms are on the small side, but it is a great place to lay your head before your next night of adventure.The staff at the Vive were helpful from the beginning. When we first arrived before check in they let us stash our luggage so we could wander around Waikiki until the room was ready. At check in they give you a cold, damp towel and a fresh glass of pineapple juice - what a great aloha! The breakfasts were relatively simple: hard boiled eggs, fresh fruit, toast and pastries - but they were all delicious and always well stocked. The lobby is trendy and comfortable and was a great place to relax and eat breakfast. The stay was delightful and the room was just what we needed between days of snorkeling and catamaran rides. The concierge was a big help as we planned our days. We did the escape to paradise package and it was great. The package fully covered our catamaran trip - what a deal! The trip was through Holokai Catamaran - which I have also reviewed. We snorkeled with green sea turtles and had a beautiful sail to diamond head. It was by far our favorite part of our trip and we only did it because Vive offered the package. Finally, when we went to check out the staff at the front desk noticed that we had a evening flight and offered us a courtesy room. We were able to leave our luggage again, have a full day on the beach and then come back and use the courtesy room to take a quick shower and nap (you get the room for an hour) before we called a Lyft to the airport. All this for no extra charge!Vive is perfect for a couple looking to leave the traditional resort behind for a more international experience - our fellow guests were from all over the world!

But there is tea and coffee and cold water available in the lobby all day and bight which I loved. Both times I got a room upgrade which was amazing. Rooms with water views can see the beach even though you are not on the main strip. It’s walking distance to the beach and all the great shops and restaurants. Many airport shuttles go to this hotel. There is valet parking available at the hotel. You can also borrow towels, umbrellas and beach toys from the lobby. There is also a local information desk that can help you with local info and tours.

It was the best hotel I could find at that price range during the time we were there. It is by no means a luxury hotel but it is very good. Very close to the beach 2-3 minutes walk, close to surf board rental, very close to a lot of resraurants, shopping... and also a bus stop right in front if you are going farther on the island. Check in was fast, we were greeted with pineapple juice and wet towels. The room was not very big but if you go to Hawaii to spend time in your room you're wasting your time and money. The shower drain was very slow to drain on the first night, but they fixed it right away when we called the next day. Breakfast could improve a lot, the items are what you would expect from a small cheap motel, so we chose to go elsewhere for a couple of mornings.They have towels, umbrellas and chairs for the beach which is nice.

Overall, we had a great experience in this hotel and were glad we chose to stay at VIVE. Pros: 1) Parking: At the time of our booking, there was a special going that offered 50% off the daily parking/valet rate. It was especially helpful that you could schedule to have your car brought down at a certain time by way of an in-room tablet app. This made travel around the island easy (which we did nearly every day)2) Breakfast is included. This was one of the deciding factors that led us to chose this hotel over others because of the money we could save not eating out for breakfast. Each morning, they serve an assortment of pastries and fresh cut fruits, along with pineapple juice, water, and coffee. 3) The beach. This hotel is walking distance to Waikiki Beach. It was very easy to get from our room to the ocean in less than 5 minutes. The hotel also offers beach chairs, towels, mats, and other essentials. 4) The service. The staff were always helpful and kind. We never had an issue with any request. This is a reason why we would return to this hotel again if we were to visit Hawaii again. 5) Lobby Interior. It is always nice to arrive back to an elegant, fun-looking place. Cons: 1) Room details. We selected the smaller queen ocean view room. While we could see the ocean from our window every morning, the window was small, and we also got a direct view into other windows of an adjacent high-rise building. I found myself wishing I had booked a room at another hotel with an ocean view and balcony, or at least one that had a window large enough for me to see the ocean while sitting in a chair. I had to stand to see the view. Not a huge deal, as we did not spend a whole lot of time in the room, but this would keep us from returning. 2) Room details part 2. We originally booked a studio apartment for our trip, but upon learning that it did not have AC and knowing that I would be 6 months pregnant, we decided to look for a place with AC The small unit in the room did not cool the room well, and the air was muggy and uncirculated. One window did open, but that did not offer circulation needed to freshen the air. Overall, we were glad to stay here on our first trip to Hawaii. Next time, we will opt to rent a home or studio in a more remote location with at least a kitchenette",,torr347,0,4.0

We traveled in a group of three adults, and were given an extra room key so we wouldn't have to share. During our stay, one key did malfunction, but the staff were very helpful in giving us a new one. Also, when we initially checked in, we were given complimentary moist towels and glasses of fresh pineapple juice to rejuvenate after our flight. Overall, service was excellent during our stay.Cleanliness: The hotel was clean in general. Our room, which was the Cosmopolitan Family Suite, was also clean. Value/Location: This is where the Vive Hotel Waikiki's greatest strength lies. The location isn't directly by the beach, but is a very short walking distance away. This means you get the benefit of being able to go to the beach whenever you like, but without all the noise and hustle that the hotels directly by the beach have. There are also plenty of food options in the area that are good eats when you get hungry. Breakfast is served daily and is satisfactory. The hotel provides free rentals of beach towels, chairs, and mats so you don't have to worry about purchasing those. Room/Sleep Quality: As much as I enjoyed my stay, I do have to be critical. The room was fine and accommodated my party of three adults. What I did not particularly enjoy was that the shower heads in the bathrooms were quite outdated. Also, the air conditioner was loud and noisy. As a light sleeper, this made it hard to fall asleep. I believe these are easy fixes and if hotel management reads this review, please consider addressing these areas.Overall: The Vive Hotel Waikiki is an excellent value hotel in a fantastic location. If you are the type who demands 4/5-star amenities (fitness room, swimming pools, balconies with clear beach/mountain views), then you may be better off looking elsewhere. However, if you don't care about those things, you'll have a great stay at this hotel and save some of that cash in your wallet for something else on the beautiful island of Oahu.",,HoneyBunchaOats,1,4.0

The breakfast is provided in the lobby area, which has comfortable chairs and looks out to a tiny garden area. (My only criticism would be that there are disposable cups for the drinks and some of the cutlery is also disposable.

I am definitely happy I tried Vive. Beyond it being located 2 short blocks from the beach (where a hula show occurs 3x/week) and at the end of Waikiki (rather than smack dab in the middle of it,) the service offered by folks like Preston, Romeo, Ryan, Erwin, KC and the continental breakfast lady who's name I did not get exceeded my expectations. I am a business traveler (though I was here for vacation) so I really appreciated the friendliness and the degree of care w/which my requests were tended to. I was interested in a junior oceanview suite but was told upon arrival that one wasn't available for the duration of my stay. I mentioned this again the next day to Preston who went forth and not only found one but on a high floor. He phoned several times as he worked to see what he could find for me. He really went above and beyond, and he didn't have to. Thank you, Preston.I enjoyed the continental breakfast, especially the pineapple. The woman who managed it did a fantastic job and was always so positive and pleasant. The area was consistently clean and food quickly replenished, even with the high volume. I also enjoyed the water, coffee and tea service available throughout the day and evening as well as the daily newspaper. The common areas were mostly clean (except when people left crumbs behind on the table,) brightly lit, well appointed and comfortable. No soiled pillows and such that I've seen in other hotels. The valet service was fab! I never had to wait more than a few minutes for my car and the gentlemen (Romeo, Ryan and Erwin) were especially friendly. I enjoyed speaking with them.Even though my room was small (I had a queen oceanview,) it was comfortable, clean and mostly updated. Little things like wearing on the chairs, chips in the wood on the bureau where the fridge is, glass table top not glued to based (which I noticed in a Jr. Suite) could be improved but I was pleased with my room. The aforementioned are actually reasons why I didn't ultimately go with the Jr. Suite. When I had requests for maintenance, they came quickly and resolved the issues. I appreciated that beach towels and mats were available for use each day. I didn't use housekeeping much but from my limited interactions with them, they were always friendly and on their job as evidenced by the cleanliness of the common areas. I was really pleased with my stay, and mostly due to the quality of service I experienced from several staff members.

The room, service, value, and experience was phenomenal. We booked the vacation about six months ago directly on their website. You can register with them and they discount the parking and will give you a complimentary room upgrade if available. We received both the upgrade and the parking discount.We truly have no complaints about our stay there. There is daily free continental breakfast...juice, coffee, pastries, and fruit. It was fresh daily and there was plenty to go around. Our room was quite spacious, we had the junior suite and we had a corner room with views of Diamond Head on one side and of Waikiki Beach on the other. The room was well appointed with a desk, sitting area with two chairs and a table. There was also a large walk-in closet to store our belongings which kept our room neat. The bathroom was also very large with an extra large shower. Housekeeping was very good and the toiletries were a nice quality as well. The valet service was prompt and courteous also. The hotel was extremely neat and clean and the location could not be beat. We parked our car after being out for the day and then walked everywhere we wanted to go in Waikiki. The proximity to bars and restaurants was so close and convenient. We felt safe walking everywhere. No concerns about the area whatsoever. I must say, we travel frequently and often pay more than twice what we paid at the Vive. In Waikiki, the hotels can be very expensive and the parking and resort fees really drive the prices up. Vive only charges a reasonable parking fee and no resort fees. We are used to high quality hotels and the Vive really knocked it out of the park for us. If you are looking for quality and value and solid service and comfort then the Vive will check all of those boxes for you.Thanks Vive for making my birthday trip extra special!","San Antonio, Texas","ryanley</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Antonio, Texas</strong>",27,5.0

Still it’s a decent value with a good away from the beach location. The service from the concierge (in particular) and the front desk was wonderful, but the concierge only works 8 AM to 2 PM. Huh? That was annoying on our arrival date at 3:00. Actually I’d call this is a nice quality budget hotel. Our room was comfortable enough. The relatively recent renovation is lacking and won’t wear well. Rubber baseboards are great in a Motel 6 but surprising here. The windows are old, single paned, unimaginatively placed and sized, and had failing mechanics. The carpet was still serviceable but will soon be more tired and worn. The furniture was beaten and and randomly selected. The provided (yay!) beach chairs were really cheap, old, and uncomfortable (boo!)There are no coffee machines in the room, but coffee is available in the lobby. The water bottle in your room costs $1.50.Still, as I said, there’s easy access to Waikiki and all it’s attraction.

We were surprised at the fact that though lots of people enjoyed the breakfast, we could still always find a seat and table. I already miss the fresh cold pineapple juice provided at breakfast! We very much appreciated the water, coffee, and tea that was available all day. It was so nice to grab a cup of coffee on your way out/in. The provided beach gear (towels, late, chairs, boogie boards, umbrellas) was fantastic to borrow for days on the beach that is just 2 short blocks away.

KC worked the concierge desk the last time I stayed at the hotel and it was a pleasure to see them again. If you have any questions about what to do, where to eat, or if you have to do a little problem solving, KC has got your back. One of the biggest perks for me is the continental breakfast that’s included. After a late night, nothing is more welcoming that hot fresh coffee, muffins, toast, eggs, and a selection of fruit.

The rooms are quiet and sensibly updated with a contemporary feel that gets the job done without quite feeling hip or luxurious--although the huge luxury shower in our junior suite was a notable exception. Our friends' non-suite room was quite small. There is no service elevator, so the guest elevators frequently stop at floors where staff are waiting (and waiting...) to bring carts up or down.

What attracted to this hotel at first was the YouTube videos showing it's beautiful lobby. I usually stay away from boutique hotels because they cost more but not this hotel. I found that this hotel was actually $300 cheaper than where I usually stay which was great. The location is great, it's on Kuhio Avenue which is behind Kalakaua Avenue, the main road down Waikiki Beach, but the walk up from the hotel to Waikiki Beach on Uluniu Avenue (which is directly across the road from the hotel with a crossing right out the front) takes you about five minutes if that. As soon as you walk into the lobby you'll be impressed, it's very bright, clean and beautiful with a lot of seating for guests, interesting things on the walls and shelves, board games and a bookcase with ""Aloha"" on it. The reception staff are very friendly and helpful. I was greeted with a nice cold glass of pineapple juice and an icy cold hand towel. Unfortunately I arrived in Honolulu at 6am, arrived at the hotel at 8am and couldn't check into my room until 3pm (ended up checking in at 1pm) but the hotel were more than happy to mind my bag and gave me access to their guest bathroom in the lobby to freshen up. I was also told to help myself to the free continental breakfast which was much appreciated. The continental breakfast was good, some fresh fruit, pastries, coffee, tea, and a large selection of bread to toast. I'll admit that after a few days I was bored with their breakfast but it was nice to just grab a coffee and a pastry to start your day. Also the coffee and tea is available all day. My room was a Cosmopolitan Queen room, their standard room, on the 19th floor with a city view. You could see Diamond Head and the ocean hiding behind all the other buildings. If you're after an ocean view get a hotel on Kalakaua Avenue not back here on Kuhio Avenue, just saying. My room was small but very clean and comfortable, perfect for just a couple or someone solo. The bed was great, I liked the storage space drawers underneath the front of the bed, good for shoes. There was the usual room safe, small closet, great tv, even robes, cold air con and free wifi. The air con and the wifi are my only cons. The air con unit was old and very noisy to the point where I preferred to turn it off and open the two windows for some fresh air. The wifi started off great, easy and strong connection but after a few days I had to keep logging back in and it was really slow. There is free wifi down in the lobby which is a lot better than what's in your room. The bathroom is very small but has a full bath and an awesome shower, great water pressure and hot water when needed. I loved the long desk with the tv on it and the little Nexus tablet next to your bed with your name on it greeting you as you walk in each day is a nice touch, you can surf the net and watch Netflix on the tablet is you don't have your own device. Housekeeping were very friendly and did a great job cleaning my room each day, usually late in the afternoon. I left them a $2 tip each day, I know it isn't much but every little bit helps huh and it's a small thank you for their service. There is a pc that guests can use in the lobby right next to the guest services person which I thought was handy but it's running an old Internet Explorer browser that kept freezing up due to security issues. Kuhio Avenue is very noisy at night with people yelling, cars beeping, etc most nights but you are in Waikiki which does get very noisy at night and very early morning. All in all the Vive Hotel Waikiki s a very nice hotel, it's clean and comfortable, good location, great price with friendly and helpful staff, free breakfast and wifi. I would recommend this hotel to couples and singles, even families if they get the Cosmopolitan Family Suite though I didn't see many kids there oh and there is no pool. Mahalo to Preston and staff for a wonderful stay.","Canberra, Australia","Mallie44</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",30,5.0

We appreciated their recommendations for restaurants and packing us breakfast for our early morning excursion.KC, the concierge, was so so helpful in recommending and booking tours.

Why pay more in other hotels when here was excellent value for money with no resort fee and a breakfast thrown in too.  Arrived here at 1 in the morning from a 20 hr flight from England and was greeted with a warm welcome and pineapple juice on check-in which was excellent. Was given room 1207 and as it was my partners 50th birthday there was a note and a small box of chocolates on the bed which was a nice touch. The room itself was just perfect for the 2 of us. Sea view, clean, safe deposit box, wifi, tablet for room service, en-suit bathroom, hairdryer, t.v, fridge and a very comfy bed and pillows. Just perfect. The room was serviced everyday by the maid. The air-con was noisy but only put it on in the evening before i went out and on my return to the room it was cool enough and just turned it off. As i was on the main street it was a bit noisy outside but it didnt really bother me.  The breakfast itself was excellent. Im usually a full English breakfast man, but would enjoy relaxing in the lounge for an hour having the selection of fruit, pastries, muffins, toast, juice, tea and coffee. There was a microwave, or combi oven available if needed.  During the day and for 24 hrs, complimentary tea and coffee was available and it was great to come back to after a days sight seeing or being on the beach. The staff were amazing. A big Aloha to Preston and to all the staff who made our stay very enjoyable. I had all my activities booked already, and my shuttle back to the airport. The staff on the front desk made my telephone calls to confirm on pick-up times from the hotel for these activities. Nothing was to much trouble.

They let us park our car in the lot way before check-in (as in 6 am and check-in is at 3). We were only there one night, just to experience Waikiki, and when we checked out, the let us keep our car there until we had to go to the airport later in the evening. The bed was very comfortable.

A forewarning, we used valet for the car which was great, but, the garage is narrow and has a few blind spots, so that's a little scary - but there's no real need to drive if you're hanging local so that's about 30 seconds of your stay.

With a mini fridge, good TV, good free wi-fi, and a very nice continental breakfast with great fresh fruit, and very reasonable prices, this is a really great choice for staying in Waikiki! The price was very reasonable and the staff fantastic. I have traveled the world and Morgan at the concierge desk and Preston and Shane at the front desk were as friendly and helpful as anywhere I have traveled . From recommending restaurants with a map included, to completely setting up our Day at the Polynesian Cultural Center, they were all above and beyond the call.

All of the other reviews will talk about being two blocks from the beach, all of the free gear that they provide with friendly service, and how great Kasi, and Morgan are at being concierges. That's all true. We really appreciate all of the last minute bookings, and tour advice from both Kasi, and Morgan. They are what made our vacation enjoyable. The one thing you won't hear about is the great bedding. The extremely soft cotton sheets are only available from hotel suppliers, so I couldn't order any. The pillows are another story. These were the most comfortable pillows that I have ever slept on. They were so good, I took one apart to find the label.

I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived at Vive Hotel to see it was clean and organized. The room is a little small but my wife and I stayed for 6 days and it was large enough for us. The location is great and the hotel will supply you beach towels, chairs and kid size boogie boards. The breakfast consisted of mostly pastries and fruit and had some hot drinks and pineapple juice. It is right next to a bus stop that could take us pretty much anywhere we wanted to go. It’s about 20 min bus ride to Ala Moana shopping center and 30 min bus to downtown. The only compliant I would have is that even on the 16th floor we were able to hear the traffic down below sometimes, but even as a light sleeper it didn’t affect my sleep at all. The black out shades and comfortable bed and exhaustion that comes with traveling allowed us to both sleep very well. Below is the picture of our room and the ocean view that we had. Although there is a building in front of you, you still can see the ocean. Also, there is not resort fee which does help with the affordability of this hotel.

The fact that you can take beach towels, mats, boogie boards with you for a day at the beach and you dont feel akward for asking as everybody is so polite and welcoming.

I didn't notice milk, but that's because we don't drink it. There were toasters and other warming devices. The lobby and dining area are not separate, but there's plenty of seating. I'm giving ""Sleep Quality"" 3 out of 5 stars for sound, not the bed/bedding. About 22hrs out of the day Waikiki is busy and loud with people, trucks, sirens, traffic, and all that transpires in a metro area. Although you can hear all the sounds from outside, I never once heard anyone else inside the hotel. My daughter had to do homework and said she didn't have a problem focusing.

Not a big deal, but a slight disappointment.The hallways seemed dark and dingy.Housekeeping needs a lot more training. The sheets were not changed once during the 6 night stay. I know because the stains that were on the sheets when we arrived, remained for the entire stay. I did type into the iPad a request for a change of sheets. I even removed most of the bedding from the bed. The stains were still there. The rug was not vacuumed once, even though they seem to be concerned about ants/bugs. Housekeeping was also not very attentive to toiletries and replacements. Overall, the room did not seem to be clean or cleaned each day. If you're paying more than $130-150, you're paying too much.

As I was only going to be in town for a couple of days and out most of the days, I didn't need an expensive resort. This is a boutique hotel located only a couple of blocks up from the ""Duke"" statue. It only took a couple of minutes to get to the water. Staff were super friendly and relaxed. I was upgraded on checkin to an ocean view room, but due to the building across the street, couldn't actually see much of the ocean. The room itself was very clean, and I had a great sleep in the comfortable bed. There is a cool tablet in each room where you can order food, browse the internet, play music etc. Wifi at the hotel worked well and I had no issues. Breakfast is mostly just fruit and pastries, although I thought the fruit was quite good. Overall I had a great experience with this smaller hotel, and would definitely stay here again on my next trip. If you are looking for a property that is a true resort, be prepared to pay way more and also pay resort fees. I thought it was refreshing that this hotel did not charge for resort fees as many other Waikiki hotels do, whether they are actually a resort or not. If you'd rather spend your money on food, activities etc, Vive Hotel is perfect option.","Toronto, Canada","tartanboy27</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,5.0

The location is awesome as it's like a 3-5 minute walk to Waikiki and the main strip where the tourist area and all the shops are (literally two lights away from everything).Service was amazing from the front desk, valet, and cleaning staff. Always friendly and willing to help. Will not try to up-sell you too much for anything and just straight up helpful.Even though there are lots of food options in the area, the Continental breakfast provided every day, which included fresh fruits (pineapple, watermelon, strawberries, cantaloupe, honey dew, and papaya), and toast/croissants, unlimited 24/7 coffee and distilled water -- was a great option and amenity. We never had to go to the ABC convenience store to get water since we just refilled our bottles most times.Don't expect to be blown away by the rooms, the two-twin rooms are quite efficiently small, just enough space for two and no more. Sliding door for the bathroom. A/C is not central and is one of those that hang out the window. Either way we got a floor that was pretty low (8th floor) which was pretty much City view so we didn't care that much. I'm not too sure whether there are Ocean view suites, but the Hotel is kind of far away from the Ocean to really get any kind of Ocean view I would think. There are much larger hotels like the Marriott and Surfrider (that's right on the beach) that I would think would block most of the Ocean view from this building.That said, since I was just going with a friend, I didn't care much for the Ocean view. But if I was going for some thing more ""romantic"" this hotel would not be my first choice. Try Surfrider or Marriott but be expected to pay a hefty premium $$$$. But don't get me wrong, the rooms were clean and nice. Just don't expect anything super fancy or ""Instagramable"" -- I'll leave it at that.Oh, another great amenity is that they provide for free body boards, beach chairs, beach mats, and beach towels for the day. That was a nice touch. Saves you some money and hassle on your beach day.The concierge was amazing and helped us plan most of the excursions that you may want to do -- seemed very knowledgeable.My advice is if you want to book this hotel, call the directly and don't book through Expedia or other sites as they might be able to offer you a better deal.All in all - would recommend this hotel for its location, decent rooms, free continental breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff.","Toronto, Canada","philipn315</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",1,4.0

Having this available allowed for a quick easy start to each day without the need to go looking for breakfast.The location of the hotel is toward the Kuhio Beach end of Waikiki so it is away from the more expensive resort hotels. None-the-less, these are in walking distance.Beach towels, mats and chairs are available without any resort fee, which is very good.The only negative was that the air conditioner was noisy at times.A special thanks to Christopher, Preston and Emily at the front desk for genuine friendliness and professionalism.

It was a decent value for the Waikiki area, but anywhere else it would've been a major disappointment.They seemed to offer many amenities that seem like they would save you money, but they were all so cheaply done that they weren't really worthwhile. Examples:Refrigerator - This one really got me. I got a junior suite so i could have a fridge and keep food in there to make lunches for the beach. When I arrived, the fridge was the same temp as the room and there was a sign inside the unit that said ""this refrigerator is not guaranteed to maintain temperatures to keep perishable items safe."" I got another fridge brought to the room, but they were very clear that it was only meant to slightly chill drinks. This to me is not a refrigerator, folks. Shouldn't be advertised as such.Continental Breakfast - Frozen pastries and fruit slices. Nothing was hot and it was the same ever day. Ended up going out every day for breakfast.Free Beach Gear! - the towels were a definite convenience, but the chairs they had were too painful and cheap to sit in.

He found the best deal for us for a 6 night stay and assured us that we would be well taken care of upon our arrival the next day. Our first clue that we were going to have a great stay was when we drove into the valet parking and Paul helped us (and he recognized he has spoken with us earlier on the phone to answer a question). The great service continued upon our check-in when we were greeted and assisted by Preston. He knew exactly what Shane had planned for us and our check in was smooth and swift. Preston worked to make sure we had a great room and when we asked him about nearby eating options, he recommended the Flour & Barley restaurant! Great suggestion!. The VIVE Hotel Waikiki provided plenty of beach towels, beach chairs, beach mats and boogie boards!

And far out the windows need to be double glazed or something because even on a high level the street noise came straight through.Location is fantastic and the towels and beach mats were a great plus. I enjoyed the water filter downstairs, saved us buying bottles upon bottles of water. The breakfast isn't anything to write home about but it was nice when I couldn't be bothered leaving the hotel one day. Staff were friendly enough. I wish there was an ice machine somewhere in the building that could be accessed by guests, I had to ask the front desk for ice and it felt a little weird. The tablet in the room was cool but a few times when we ""scheduled"" our room cleaning we came back to a notification that it had been done, but it actually hadn't. The TV allows HDMI input, that was excellent. And I did like the drawers under the bed that allowed us to unpack our things.

The first thing we noticed was the professionalism of all the staff and their incredibly service. It started with the valet guy (wish I remembered his name). He helped us with our luggage and told us where we needed to go and had a great attitude. We went down to the service desk and a few moments later, he ran out of the elevator with our phone saying we had forgotten it in the car. We were VERY impressed by the gentleman and really grateful for him. The front desk was just as friendly and helpful and got our room key quickly and were in our rooms in no time. The room was clean and comfortable and everything was in working order. It was perfect for what we needed. As for the location of the hotel, it was walking distance from everything we had on our list to eat, from udon to spam musubi to 88 tees, and tons of other places. The location was PERFECT. Breakfast was included with our stay which was continental, and honestly, I usually skip it because the pastries are typically not very good and stale. We were pleasantly surprised. It was the BEST continental breakfast we have ever had. They had delicious and fresh pastries, modern and working toasters and toaster ovens, tons of fresh fruit, and fresh pineapple juice, and more. We ended up getting thirds - it was THAT good, and I'm not a huge breakfast guy to begin with.

Lobby is nice, and the few amenities they have are just what you need - beach equipment, basic breakfast, good internet, cool-looking lounge and not much more. If you need a pool and a lot of expensive shops in your hotel, this isn't your place. With the money you save over the big hotels, you can rent your umbrella and beach chairs on the beach every day, which is what we did. Staff is friendly and competent, and they do have a concierge to help if you need that sort of thing. Only a couple blocks from the beach, this is a great value, and perfect if you're comfortable finding your own food and arranging your own beach days.

Based on the Tripadvisor reviews, I chose Vive, and we couldn't be happier with the decision. Vive has smart, hip decor: comfy sofas and chairs with colorful throw pillows, beautiful appointments and art, with large picture window facing a serene tropical garden/fountain. This “Living Room” not only is a place to chill out and read (a small library of books to borrow) or catch up on emails, it is where all gather in the AM for continental breakfast. Assorted fruit, breads and pastries, juice, tea, and coffee (also available 24 hours) is served from 7-9:30 AM. We booked the Lifestyle Jr Suite, a slight upgrade from the standard room, and we were very pleased with the comfort, spaciousness, and yes—the view! We had an ocean view straight down the street to the Duke Kahanamoku Statue! There is a large walk in closet, with safe, iron/ironing board, a large desk and chair, 2 accent chairs, coffee table, huge bathroom (the shower was amazing!), 2 air conditioners, TV, small fridge (it’s not the coldest fridge, so keep that in mind when putting perishables in it), and a King sized bed that is incredibly comfortable. Yes, there is no pool or fitness room, and there is also NO resort fee. But beach supplies (towels, mats, boogie boards, small beach chairs) are free and in ample supply. Morgan at the concierge desk was really helpful when we were looking for a tour to take around the island (Circle Island Tour). Kuhio Beach Park and Queen’s Beach are 3 blocks down the street, and there are several places to grab a bite (Ruffage makes great natural food meals/sandwiches, Shorefyre has delicious breakfasts with no wait, Me BBQ is awesome Korean food). If you want to explore the Waikiki area, and not be “locked"" into your hotel/resort with exorbitant prices, but appreciate a clean, smart, and comfortable and affordable accommodations, then Vive is the hotel for you.","Seattle, Washington","Mara F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",23,5.0

There are a number of reasons why:- I have to start off by saying the ENTIRE staff in this hotel are amazing! They answered all questions in such a kind manner, were willing to help with anything, went out of their ways to make sure your stay at this hotel is going well. We have stayed at some huge name hotels but the service at this one tops all other names. INCREDIBLE service! A shoutout to Paul, Beverly, Marilyn, Emily, Chris, Kevin, Ryan, Shane, Roger, Adam, and anyone else we missed for your SUPERB service! I really hope the owner/s of this boutique hotel know how awesome you all are and hopefully give you good raises! ;) lol-The hotel itself is very modern looking and clean.-Every morning there was breakfast consisting of fruits, toast, juice, tea, croissants, and muffins. It's not a full breakfast but it was perfect for us as there are so many places around for breakfast/lunch. As well, tea and water was always available!- The hotel was super close to the beach and strip (maybe a  2 min or less walk).- the hotel allows you to rent out beach chairs, beach umbrellas, rain umbrellas, beach mats, boggie boards, and towels absolutely free of charge. It's pretty expensive to rent outside the hotel. - The bus line runs on this street so it was super convenient when going places. The bus itself stopped practically next to the hotel. - we rented a car and the valet parking was only $25/night which is a great price when comparing to other places - Our flight was later in the evening. The hotel staff were kind enough to keep our things and what we loved the most was, you are allowed to sign out a curtosy room to get freshen up before leaving to the airport (take a shower, nap, chill out, change, get ready). That was awesome!- Before coming, some of the reviews we read mentioned the rooms were small. They are small but not to the point where you can't move. We didn't have a problem with it the rooms. My husband and I are heavy global travellers and would say this is the typical size of a room. We didn't spend our days in our room - we would sleep, get up, shower, leave, come back to freshen up, and were out again. Thank you for an incredible stay! We recommend this hotel to everyone!

Comfortable and well appointed guest rooms with free WiFi and all the basic amenities you need when holidaying in Hawaii.Pros:1. Location, location, location. Close to everything you could possibly want to do at Waikiki. The Bus stops right outside and most tour pick-ups are meters away.2. Breakfast buffet. Much needed before going out doing touristy stuff. Pastries and fruit only but if you want a heavy breakfast there are many options nearby.3. Beach stuff available for free. Don't get fleeced by the beach umbrella/chair/mat rentals on the beach. The hotel provides everything you need, no charge. Just get to the beach early to get a prime spot.4. Courtesy room: In case you have a late flight and want to get in some beach time before you leave, the hotel very kindly provides a guest room for an hour so that you can rest and take a shower before you go even after checking out. Very highly appreciated! 5. Economical. No ""resort fee"" as charged by many of the other hotels.6. Free (and fast) WiFiCons:1. No bar/restaurant in the hotel. Not much of a con, really. There are several amazing options literally steps away for food and drink. Do you really want to stay in your hotel all day? Get out and explore!2. No gym/health club/spa: Again, see above. Many larger hotels nearby have spas that can be booked even if you aren't a guest. The Hyatt is right next door and has a great spa.3. No/limited view: This is not a beachfront hotel. You can see the ocean from the higher floors if your room faces south but there are buildings in the way. If you have the gumption to actually leave the hotel and walk a few steps, you get all the views you like right from the beach.

We did not encounter any bugs in our room or even in the lobby (other than flies, nothing out of the ordinary).

Breakfast consisted of fruit (oranges, pineapple, cantaloupe, melon, among others, depending on the day) and pastries (such as muffins, bread).

I imagine if you're on a lower floor that noise would be annoying. Someone hanging around near the hotel offered to sell us drugs and we did see one man passed out at the bus stop right beside it. We weren't really bothered but I wouldn't stay here again if I had kids. In saying that the actual hotel is lovely and the staff are overall very friendly and accommodating. We arrived at 7am and because I e-mailed them saying we'd be arriving so early, they managed to have the room ready for us to check in. This was a huge life-saver as it took about 15hrs to get there! We had a junior suite so our room was a very good size, clean and comfortable. The bed and shower were huge. The only problem we had with the room was the same thing everyone has a problem with here, the air conditioner. On top of the standard loud noise those box air cons make, ours started making weird loud banging noises all night, about 3 nights before we checked out (this was when it was not turned on). We were moved to the room next door for one night whilst they fixed it. We were told it was fixed but when we came back it was still making the same noise. Not a big deal, but annoying.The free breakfast was good, though basic. Fruit, pastries and toast. The little sitting are was really nice and a good place to meet other guests. The free tea and coffee 24/7 was a life saver, as my husband and I drink about 10 cups of tea a day each haha. They have free beach gear too, which was great! Boogie boards, mats, chairs and umbrellas. Free Wi-Fi was fast and didn't drop out.Unfortunately, we had something small taken from our room. It was an old military glasses case that was filled with proper art pens/pencils. It magically disappeared from the night stand two nights before we checked out. I'd recommend you leave everything you can't carry with you in the safe or locked in your suitcase. Even things that don't seem to be worth stealing. Overall, we would stay here again because it is excellent value for money. It is less than half the price of the hotels on the beach, but only a 5 minute walk away. There is no resort or wi-fi fee, breakfast is included and you can borrow beach gear for free (renting an umbrella is $29 a day at the HHV to put it in perspective). The bus stop right outside was convenient and the trolley stop is 5mins the road at the Hilton.","Gold Coast, Australia","Toofwess</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gold Coast, Australia</strong>",11,4.0

The location is great, just two blocks from Waikiki Beach, and close to tons of great food options - grab something from Musubi Cafe and eat it at the beach! The Vive Hotel has paid great attention to detail in all areas of the property. From the pineapple juice at check in to the waiting area in the parking garage, you really feel like you are welcome and appreciated. The rooms are small, but set up in a way that maximizes the space so well that you don't even notice. The drawers are under the bed to save space! You also have a cool tablet with the hotel info that you can use on the wifi. The hotel offers free continental breakfast, which is delicious, beach towels and beach toys for your use, and a business center. The parking is valet only, but at a rate that's the same as self parking at a lot of other hotels in the area (and anyway, if you aren't planning to leave Waikiki, no car needed - the bus stops right out front).

We arrived earlier than they expected - 9.00am - and we were told that our room wouldn't be ready until 3.00pm. However, the staff member behind the counter noticed that I'd signed up for the 'My Personal Vive' option on the Vive website and this entitled me to a free upgrade if one was available. He did so and we were upgraded to a room twice the size of our original booking (thanks Sato!!). It had a walk in shower, a fridge and a huge bed. Tip 1: sign up for the My Personal Vive option on their website.We soon discovered the hotel was very handily located next to a bus stop (out the front door and turn right) from which you can catch buses to Ala Moana Centre, Pearl Harbor and a variety of other places. Tip 2. download the app 'DaBus'. This will give you real time access to the bus schedules for all bus stops including the one by the Vive. Tip 3. Use the Vive shuttle service to the Waikele Outlet Centre - it's cheaper than Roberts.We were literally 4-5 mins away from the beach (and decent coffee which was best bought in the Hyatt Regency) and the main strip - Kalakaua Ave. Also, we were 10 minutes walk from the 'Food Pantry' - the only decent supermarket in Waikiki (its cheaper than the ABC stores and a better selection).The staff were really helpful and professional and knew the answers to everything and weren't afraid to help you out with any issues. Emily let me use all my pennies towards my bill at the end which was very much appreciated (what else was I going to use them for).The only gripe I had was the breakfast. It wasn't bad - but it needed some more options - particularly around protein. The breads and the muffins and the fruit are good - but some ham, cheese, sausages etc would really help. But it's the only thing I could really recommend they improve.So, overall, a great hotel - well situated, excellent staff, free wifi, comfortable rooms, could do better on the breakfasts, reasonably priced and very clean.

Normally the lower the price the lower the reviews, it ended up being the best decision for my first trip to Hawaii. Right off the bat I will say that this is what you might call a budget hotel, unless you shell out some more money the rooms are small and you won't get a beach view, but for me I don't need all that because I was barely in the room other than to sleep and shower. We had a double bed room and it was perfect. It had a fridge, a safe, comfortable, clean beds and a tv. The thing that puts this hotel over the top for me was considering it is a lower priced hotel it had awesome accommodations. When you check in you get wonderful smelling cool towels for your face along with a cold glass of pineapple juice. The employees are friendly and very helpful. We had so many questions during our stay and they always were able to help with transportation or pointing us the right way to something. They have beach towels, beach mats, boogie boards, umbrellas and chairs available for you to use at the beach which is a straight walk out of the hotel and two blocks away. Awesome breakfast, with all kinds of breads, fruit, sausage rolls, muffins etc That saves so much money on food costs, which is greatly needed with the restaurant prices for food. They hold your luggage till check in and if your flight is late they will hold your luggage after check out and offer you a courtesy room to clean up in if you want to spend time at the beach the day before you go. Also the decor is just very lovely, the breakfast area is not traditional tables, but really trendy chairs/couches and tables. They have a library for you to borrow books for the beach as well as two computers for you to print anything you need. I really just can't say enough about this hotel, I felt like I got so much more than I paid for. They made our stay great, and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants great accommodations for a great price.","Victoria, Texas","47christyd</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Victoria, Texas</strong>",20,5.0

The room, although small, was adequate for the 2 of us for 4 nights and was clean and the bed comfortable. We appreciated the mini-fridge in the room. There was some noise from the street, but the white noise provided by the (rather loud) air conditioner lulled us to sleep each night. Breakfast was perfectly adequate for our needs and free!! -- fruit and pastries were much better than we had anticipated based on some of the reviews. Granted, no big proteins, but qood bread, peanut butter, delicious croissants and a few other pastries to start the day. There could be a few more tables/chairs as the breakfast area tended to get crowded at peak times. The all day tea and coffee in the lobby is a nice touch. We were delighted with the central location. Really, only a 5 minute walk to the Duke statue on the beach, easy access to a bus stop to take you almost anywhere on the island, close to restaurants, shopping.

Even though I was by myself I didn't feel if I had another person in the room it will be too small because trust me I have stayed in smaller rooms in Japan, and compared to that this room is a luxury. The room is exactly as shown on their website, their photos are not photoshopped in any way, it was exactly how it looked.

We were very happy with our decision because it wasn't a huge commercial building with endless hallways and elevators. Instead, it felt like we were checking into our own vacation home. Everything was modern and cozy. Valet was very convenient and the building was easy to access since the hotel is just a block or two away from the busy roads of Waikiki. We got the Jr Suite which had a view of the Waikiki beach and Diamond Head. It was the perfect amount of space to relax for the two of us. The small fridge was convenient to store any drinks, leftovers, or delicious fresh mangoes i bought from the outdoor market nearby. The shower was HUGE. Although we didn't hang out at the Waikiki Beach area, we did notice there were free beach gear available to rent (like body boards, chairs, towels, mats). I typically look for a fitness centre and swimming pool when i'm traveling, but I wasn't too disappointed that Vive didn't have these because you had a beach out front (5 min walk) and so many recreation activities nearby to keep us active (hiking, paddle boarding, swimming, etc). Many hotels don't have breakfast deals, but it was nice that there's a free breakfast time in the morning to get some fruit and pastries.

My wife and I were more comfortable and relaxed at the Vive plus the price is way cheaper and the hotel is right down the street. The valet is half the price at the Vive plus there is complementary breakfast. This makes Vive an excellent value and should be a top-choice for any bargain hunters that don't require a beachfront hotel with shopping and high-end restaurants next door. Rooms: The regular rooms are small yet functional. They do not have a coffee maker or microwave but do have a mini-fridge. Bathrooms are clean and modern. Beds are very comfortable. TV's offer a standard collection of cable channels. Window mount AC get's the job done but is not as nice as the built-in units you typically see a Hilton/Marriott. Lobby: The ""Livingroom"" is well decorated, clean, and contemporary with an ""art hotel"" feel. There is lots of space to hang out, relax, and eat the complementary breakfast. There is a microwave and toaster-ovens if you need to warm up leftovers. There is no bar or restaurant. Valet: The cost is $25 a day. We paid $39 a day down the street at the Marriott. It's a great value and the staff is nice and there is usually no wait. Breakfast: Who else provides complementary breakfast on Waikiki? They offer a variety of fruits (strawberry, pineapple, melon) and numbers breads & baked goods. I typically filled up on fruit and cinnamon rolls. Free coffee and tea are included. This presents a huge value and savings if you don't require bacon/sausage/eggs in the morning. Location: The hotel is two blocks from the beach and provides full-size towels, umbrellas, boogies boards. All for free. Nice restaurants on the other side of Waikiki are a 10 minute walk thru the shopping district.","Cincinnati, Ohio","Logzor</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cincinnati, Ohio</strong>",3,5.0

Coffee/tea/water was available 24/7 and the lobby had some boardgames for you to play if you find yourself with a little spare time.Upon check out, it was very easy - the hotel also has a concierge service which helped you book things like activities, tours, shuttle services etc. The hotel helped me book a shuttle service to the airport which only costed $12 pp including baggage.

I ended up booking this hotel via TripAdvisor website directly due to the price and its overall rating. Although there are few disappointments (keep reading), I am still giving it a 5-Star rating due to the overall performance.The PLUS:- Located in the midst of bustling Waikiki Beach. 2 blocks away from the beach. 1.5 block from the International Market. 2 blocks from a super popular Marukame Udon restaurant.- The lobby and its first floor area are very modern & chic. It is decorated with Thai arts and it has many calm and welcoming colors.- The room is clean and chic as well. It has some minimalist feel to it.- Every room has a tablet for you to select multiple services you need such as getting extra towels, have them bring up your car when you get to 2nd floor (garage floor).- They are very prompt when I asked for the car. Average 3-5 minutes wait max after arriving at the garage level (2nd floor), the valet will show up and retrieve the car quickly.- The staffs are friendly and respond quickly.- You can borrow beach mats, towels, & even boogie boards from the lobby for your use. - It includes FREE breakfast with pineapple juice, coffee, fruits, & several selection of pastries, The raspberry toast is the BEST!!!The ""Disappointment""- The sink was a joke because it is not deep so you do want to be careful when washing hands or brush teeth because water can splash everywhere. I am hoping they can update the sink because it is not useful much.- Room are ""minimalist"" meaning it is fairly small and tight. Upon entering the room, most of my traveling companions asked me to check with front desk to see whether larger rooms are available but the larger ones are Penthouse Suites. We decided not to upgrade later since we will be outdoor more often. However, I did overheard front desk receptionist has the exact same conversation/request from other guests on the phone.- OVERALL - The room is great and acceptable. Most issue people might find is with the bathroom. The design of the bathroom is good but the vanity can use some serious upgrade.","San Jose, California","warrenlee95</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Jose, California</strong>",31,5.0

Although the cosmopolitan queen room was small, I stayed solo and it was no bother. I could even get a glimpse of the ocean by standing in a corner even though it wasn't an ocean view room.

I received a box of Godiva chocolates and an apology note on my bed, which was a lovely gesture, however, I would have preferred a room change (I was too busy with work to suggest this and assume that the staff did not bother as no one asked me if it was all ok during my stay). There was noise every night as the hotel is on a main street; either from pedestrians shouting or police stopping people/vehicles; not really what was expected. Hotel check-in, like all other hotels in Waikiki have late check-in. Not catering for early flight arrivals. The reception team said that I should have bought an extra night if I wanted an early check-in...hmmm..great opportunity missed to cross sell when I made my booking?! The hotel charges for bottles of water which are from Hawaii...a real turn-off as water represents gesture of hospitality.

The hotel lobby and the hotel staff are the true highlight of this hotel. The lobby is well stocked with newspapers, books, local information and coffee. It's always clean and even smells sweet! The staff were extremely polite and helpful - and by adding the little touches of a fresh drink and cold towel on checking in, made us feel welcome and genuinely cared for.We knew the hotel lacked some of the obvious amenities of the bigger hotels - such as a bar and a pool. But when you fly half-way across the world to paradise, a hotel pool is not high on our list! And we ate at a different restaurant every night.

Tablets in the room let you request the car and amenities (like an ironing board and iron). We were on the 17th floor and didn't experience any of the noise issues that I see some others did.

I found a couple of roaches around the TV platform on the desk the second day, and lifted up the TV set, and found several dead bodies of roaches. i reported this issue to the reception, and staff members were responsive to my concerns and asked if they could send people to handle the problem. But I declined cuz I would leave early next morning. A lot of packing we had to do, and my wife and I are not the type of people who bristle at roaches. The reception sent Staff members to clean up the dead bodies of roaches around TV, and delivered their apology cards and a basket of candies to our room in person. As a guy doing research in PR, i have to say Vive Hotel handles the issue in a good manner from the perspective of public relations and customer relationship management. BUT before I went to bed and left the room next morning, I still saw/caught several roaches near desk, carpet, bed (one on the bed) and bathroom, which are the places where roaches commonly can be found. I did decide to book this hotel after seeing the positive reviews on booking site. Seems that almost no one came across such issues. I visited Hawaii many times, and had never saw a single roach in hotel previously. No idea how this happened. Maybe I had bad lucks this time. Hope those roaches do not go home with me.Except the roach issue, this hotel is not bad. Staff members are friendly. Check in and out are good. Location is good.

Vive is very convenient to the Kuhio Beach Park on Waikiki beach. Excellent staff - super friendly and helpful; Chris and Mike at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful to us during our stay. Also Jordan and Ryan in the garage - very helpful and welcoming. It was refreshing when the staff remembered our names and greeted us warmly when we interacted with them. Also quick to get us anything we needed. We arrived after midnight, but were welcomed on arrival with a chilled glass of pineapple juice and chilled damp towels. After a long flight from the east coast, it was very refreshing and appreciated.The hotel is a great size - certainly qualifies as a ""boutique"" hotel - small enough to not feel like a number, but large enough to have all the important amenities. Great free breakfast with fresh pastries and a variety of fresh fruit. Free coffee at all hours (always tasted fresh). They don't have an in-house restaurant, but there are dozens close by and you can order food delivered to your room from many of them.The hotel provides free beach chairs, beach towels, boogie boards, bamboo beach mats, floats, etc. While the hotel is not directly on the beach, it is a very short walk to Kuhio Beach park on Waikiki Beach (less than 2 minutes) and shorter to the glitzy shoreline drive with all the high-end shopping, clubs and restaurants. You can save a lot of money by staying at the Vive and still walk over to the Moana Surfrider beach bar for appetizers, cocktails, live music and enjoying the sunset over the water from the beach.The rooms are smallish, but our junior sweet had a king bed and plenty of room, and the tiled, glass-door walk-in shower was enormous. Towels were large, fresh and fluffy, Bathrobes were as good as any I've seen at the Ritz Carlton. Bed was comfortable and linens were high quality. Be sure to ask for a high room with an ocean view.Only a couple of negatives, and they aren't huge - we opted for an ocean-view junior suite. The view was great. But the two window A/C units were loud. I sleep very soundly, but if you are a light sleeper, they might very well wake you up all night long. Secondly, if you are renting a car, keep in mind that the the hotel has no self-parking - valet only - and charges $25/night. That's not outrageous compared to other hotels in the area, but wasn't included in my budgeting. Here's a suggestion: there are several car rental places convenient to the hotel. Rent as-needed and only for the day. Don't pay by the week for your car and have to add $175 week for parking it at night at the hotel. We drove three times to Diamond Head and were turned away each time because there was no available parking. We ended up using Uber to get there instead. When driving to the North Shore, Chase Rentals (one block from Vive) offers convertible Camaros, Corvettes, and Miatas.

It's eclectic and different. They cater to your needs and treat you like royalty. I had a few issues in my room they were taken care of. I had a few ants and a roach. They called maintenance and he came right up and sprayed. I wish they had real blankets. The duvet covers inside filling was not real effective and kind of sloppy. The refrigerators aren't designed to keep food at a real frig temperature. I've never heard of that before but I had bought milk and it was barely cold. Even with all I have said I would stay there again in a minute. The fruit breakfast was fabulous, the views were beyond fabulous, they had boogie boards, chairs and towels and mats at the front desk that you just bring bag when you are done. They had coffee and tea in the lobby at all times. The room I was in had a shower that was the size of my bathroom at home. I loved it!! Water was hot and the water pressure was great. They do have window units. They seemed new and clean but you might need to help them out by keeping your blinds closed when you are out. My room faced the sun and was high up on the 20th floor so that might have been part of it. By the way they had two sets of blinds in my room.

We could have been upgraded for a small nightly fee for 5 of the 10 days but we chose to stay where we were. Be careful if you book on AARP because I swore I booked 2 queens.

Would be nice to have the option of a king bed in a regular room at just a little more than the queen.The hotel is on one of the main streets, so you will get traffic noise.

The only exception is one gentleman from reception whom we complained to about an issue in our room and every subsequent encounter had been unpleasant he had a very clear air of ""I don't care to him.""The room: claustrophobic, I've stayed in a cruise cabin that used a smaller space better. Really that's where the issues start. We were kindly upgraded to an oceanview closet from our original city view closet upon checkin that was awesome. What wasn't awesome was to find tiny ants in our toothbrushes, in the closet and around our bed the next morning (no, we did not bring anything to the room). The unhelpful gentleman (see above) didn't really care and offered for our room to get sprayed with an insecticide, my wife can be exposed to any harsh chemicals. After much arguing he agreed to move us to another room. The other room was a downgrade from what we had and required us to walk through what I coined the walk of death, essentially an open air corridor with a railing on the 19th floor. It would have been cool to walk past but not when you have heavy suitcases and are carrying things. I spotted an ant in this room as well but not as many. Also the noise from the street was brutal even on the 11th floor. - The fridge is weak - a note is inside it saying that it's not suitable for perishables- the bathroom looked tired, evidence of leaks was present and the bath tub paint was peelingThe plus side is that they had nexus tablets in the rooms which you could use.Location - not bad, 5 minute walk to international marketplace, 8 to the Royal HawaiianValet - staff are amazing, $25 is lower than other places in the area, didn't want to bother looking for street parking Breakfast - A sugary nightmare, a medley of baked goods and fruit, all that will spike your glycemic index. This would have been perfect if I was a teen but in my early thirties I can't afford to eat that for breakfast. We ate breakfast elsewhere on multiple occasions. The coffee was fantastic though - Kona Coffee.Other cool aspects - beach towels, boogie boards and beach mats are available for free.Bottom Line: Would I stay here again? That's a firm no for me. Should you stay here? If you are on a really tight budget and want a descent hotel, and are not claustrophobic or scared of heights (for some rooms) and are not afraid of breakfast foods that are pure sugar or care to eat elsewhere I'd say yes. I've stayed at worse but better rated places with a higher star ranking.","Toronto, Canada","OVyyz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",7,3.0

This hotel is situated about 2 blocks from the famous beach. Staying at a boutique hotel is a very different experience from a larger chain. This hotel does not offer the usual pool/spa etc but does give you something unique. Entering the hotel your welcomed with a cold towel to refresh and a nice cold juice, they know you by name and I even got a belated happy birthday from the reception team (my birthday was the week before) so clearly they take the time to get to know their patrons. Reception enters a funky sitting area with a constant supply of tea/coffee and cold water available for guests. Staying at the hotel included continental breakfast which is great. Your room has a tablet to link you in with hotel amenities and local points of interest. You can access beach gear to borrow and there is a concierge to help you make the most of your stay. There is also a bus stop a few steps from the hotel. However ask the concierge about using the bus system, we took the bus to the outlet stores and it took forever (nearly 2 hours)..... A shuttle bus is the best option for this shopping experience. The only down side for me was the size of our room. I accept we booked the cheapest so I was not expecting a penthouse, but compared to other hotels we stayed at along the strip the room we had was small, there was no balcony which also made it a little claustrophobic, the bathroom was well appointed but also very tiny. For us it was not a huge downer as we were out exploring most of the time but for those of you who like a little rest or downtime opt for a larger room with some more space. Overall this is a modern exciting hotel which will give the bigger chains a run for their money.",,Melba007,5,4.0

Booked a Junior Suite which was a corner location and on the 15th floor. Very comfortable bed (pillows a bit big) and large bathroom that also doubled as a disabled shower. Large screen TV in the living area, a writing desk and a separate closet all added to the feeling of space. Very attentive front desk staff made us welcome each time we arrived back from our activities and Kasi on the Tour Desk was very knowledgeable. Continental breakfast was fine as was the all-day/night coffee station. Would have liked to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room so we didn't have to trek downstairs every time we wanted a coffee.Location was a plus as you walked out the front door, crossed the street and 2 short blocks later you were at The Dukes Statue on Waikiki Beach. Walking distance to the newly opened International Market (take plenty of money) and of course a visit to the Cheesecake Factory is a must. Best way to get around is The Bus and for $2.50 you can travel almost around the Island. A visit to the Outlet Stores at Waikele is also a must and you can go broke saving money on all the bargains you can pick up. Coach Store was an eye opener and my wife managed to spend a very long time in there. (as well as spend a lot of cash..lol)On the whole, a very nice boutique style hotel in the centre of all the action with few detractions (aircon in the window a bit noisy) but would definitely stay here again.","Brisbane, Australia","Ketsuda U</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",3,4.0

Our room 2107 was positioned high on the south side with views towards the mountains and east to the ocean. We even had our very own little entry balcony on approach to the room.It seems the hotel staff enjoy their work. They always acknowledged us when we walked in or out of the lobby.

I have used boutique hotels before and I am usually quite happy with them. In this case I had a significant issue with the size of the room and particularly the bathroom. For one person it is probably OK but for two people it was just not satisfactory. As the old joke goes I felt like I had to step outside to change my mind. Cleanliness was no problem and staff were excellent. The physical space was just too confining for us and our luggage. Small closet space, shallow sink that drained poorly and newspaper would have been a better choice for toilet paper then the gritty stuff that was provided. Once you are in the price range that we were paying it would have been better to pay an extra $40 or $50 a night and get better room and amenities. For a single individual on a limited one or two day stay this is probably a good option. For couples or longer stays, you may want to consider somewhere else.","Vancouver, Canada","drdave007</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",24,3.0

There was enough variety to get through until lunchtime.There are ABC stores within a few minutes walk away and plenty of eating places nearby.KC at the concierge desk was awesome, we had issues with our shuttle cancelling on us for a Pearl Harbour visit.

Overall, I thought that it was an excellent value and I was very satisfied. I will comment on some of the negative and some of the positive aspects. On the negative side, the rooms are not large (but are as advertised), and the window-mounted air conditioning units are noisy. Also, the hotel does not have a swimming pool, nor a bar, nor a restaurant, nor a nightclub, nor a gym, nor stores, etc. But all these amenities are readily available within walking distance. If you plan to spend all your time at in your room, or in the hotel, then this is not the best choice. The positive aspects far outweigh the negatives. The rooms are clean, well-equipped, and fairly quiet especially if your room is on the back side of the hotel (except for the aforementioned air conditioning units). There is almost no noise from other rooms. The high speed wifi works very well. The continental breakfast consists of fresh fruit, a wide assortment of pastries and bread, great-tasting juice, coffee, etc. Coffee is available all day in the lobby. The lobby is large and very-well decorated. The local daily newspaper is provided at no additional charge. The hotel provides towels and chairs for use at the beach (just a couple of short blocks away). All the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. The concierge arranged a rental car for me, and provided excellent advice on how to visit the many attractions on the island to get the most out of the experience. My flight home was in the evening, long after check-out time (noon). The hotel stored my baggage, and provided me with the use of a room, at no charge, for an hour before I left for the airport to shower and change. I should also mention that I had the opportunity to visit friends in some of the other hotels in the vicinity with comparable prices. I will refrain from saying anything except that I was very happy that I chose to stay at the Vive.","Puerto Vallarta, Mexico","Evadvan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Puerto Vallarta, Mexico</strong>",11,5.0

I had really researched what hotel would provide the best value for money and the best location. Thanks to all other Tripadvisor contributions I can definitely confirm that the Vive Hotel Waikiki wins hands down! Brilliant location – 10 out of 10:Extremely convenient location on Kuhio Avenue – just use the walkway directly outside the lobby to cross Kuhio Avenue, walk down Uluniu Avenue for 5 minutes and voila, you have arrived at the corner of Kalakaua Avenue (major, prestigious shopping strip). On the other side of the road is the famous Duke Kahanamoku Statue and the iridescent blue of Waikiki Beach. On that 5 minute walk you will come across two ABC stores a Mexican restaurant and our favourite – Jinroku Pacific (teppanyaki grill). If you walk a few minutes in the other direction, along Kuhio Avenue, within minutes you arrive at the Kuhio Avenue entrance to the newly opened International Marketplace. Exceptional reception staff – 10 out of 10:Without doubt the staff on reception were so exceptional we have to give them a 100% spot on mark! We are very well travelled and it was clear that the reception staff have been selected for their professionalism, warmth and friendliness – they were the best that we have ever encountered. Whether you arrive at 3.30 am or have many questions during the day, nothing is too much trouble. Want some beach gear – no problem. Want a recommendation for dinner – no problem. Repeatedly we overheard “you’re good to go, do you need a transfer to the airport”? They make the check-in and check-out so easy. The reception staff are the ‘face’ of the Vive Hotel Waikiki and what a friendly face that is! The rooms – 9 out of 10:We booked a Junior Suite Mountain View for USD$210 per night. Upon arrival, yes, the first impression is “it’s a bit bland”. The room itself was a good size (lots of room to spread out your luggage) but there is no ‘pizzazz’ as such. In saying this, it really doesn’t matter as you are out and about most of the time anyway. Features of the room are a fantastically comfortable bed, a great shower, a fridge (no minibar but 2 bottles of water are available), a safe and a bedside tablet. (Note no plug in the bathroom sink for shaving).The lobby – 10 out of 10:The lobby is comfortable with leather lounges and a nice area to enjoy the free of charge breakfast which is available from 7.00 am. Breakfast consists of fruit, pastries, muffins, toast and jam and of course the all important coffee to kickstart your day. In fact the coffee is available throughout the day and night.In summary, we would give the Vive Hotel Waikiki a 10 out of 10 mark for the location and the brilliance of the staff and we wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again.",Hobart,"SereneHobart</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hobart</strong>",35,5.0

Some of the most accommodating and friendliest workers I've experienced on the island.From the valet to front desk, everyone was professional and very helpful. The concierge, KC, was awesome!! Just a really great staff all around....but no matter how great the people who work here are unfortunately it can't make up for the rooms themselves.Honesty for the rates we paid the rooms at this location were pretty disappointing. VERY small and the AC in our room made the worst noise.The location is right in the heart of Waikiki so that is a plus and the decor is very fun however the basic necessities could use a big upgrade. The rooms are so small that eating in them is uncomfortable and close to impossible. To make up for that they make the lobby area very welcoming and it can accommodate seating areas for small groups and couples however if you prefer eating in the peace of your room this hotel isn't really set up for you.They also lock the parking garage at night which I understand is a safety measure and cuts down on unwanted outside parking but it definitely made checking in late at night a little difficult. Again the staff was very apologetic and helpful but not the best first impression.If you want a hotel with great location a stellar staff and you don't plan on doing much but sleeping in your room then this place will probably do it for you.

Everything was just so conveniently located. The downside, in my opinion, is the breakfast buffet. It's just pastries and fruits. There's coffee, water and one choice of juice. I was hoping for pineapple juice but every day it was guava juice. Also, there're no real milk for coffee, just creamer packets. The plates are appetizer or dessert portion sizes so you can't fit no more than two items at a time on them. There is no formal dinning area so you have to eat by the lobby on fancy chairs with small accent tables for your small plates and coffee. There are real plates and silverware for the food but all the drinks are served in paper or plastic cups. The decor is also somewhat odd. It has a hindu tribal feel to it with loud music in the lobby to match. Not really the hawaiin feel I was expecting.

We were told it wouldn't be long so went for a walk and returned at 2. That is 2 hours. The same person on reception didn't recognize us and had to ask our name and relook up our details. For a relatively small hotel this doesn't give a good first impression. We then had to wait a further hour in reception for the room to be ready. And the wait wasn't worth it. We had booked a 17th floor sea view room. Yes, there was a sea view but the room amenities were, in our view, poor.

And after the first day we should have expected but room servicing was done as late as after 4pm. You might say you get what you pay for, but this hotel is not exactly cheap. We spent the first two nights of our holiday at the Ilukai - same price and way better. So, disappointing. Won't return to this hotel.

There's beach chairs, mats and towels that are free for guests to use.As mentioned, the rooms are on the small side (but not as small as NY rooms...) and the aircon unit is really loud even on the lowest fan setting (I had to turn it off and open the window to sleep), but quite fine otherwise.

However, it did get very busy in at breakfast time and it was a struggle to get somewhere to sit at times.Room was small but functional with effective, but rather noisy air conditioning. There is a reasonable amount of clothes hanging space but no drawers. There are some small shelves by the side of the bed but I found these quite thick with dust on arrival which was not pleasant and rather disappointing. Maid service for the first half of our trip (we stayed 8 nights) was not brilliant. The bed was made and bins emptied but not much else happened. The bath was not cleaned for about 4 days possibly 5 as we had been at the beach all day and when we stepped into the bath we left footprints from the grime we had collected on our feet. This was not cleaned and the toiletries we had used were not replaced so we were left with nothing. This was also disappointing as the maid had cleared the bins so surely it would be obvious these need to be replenished. After day 5 or 6 the new maid left a card in our room to introduce herself and all of the previous issues were remedied - bath cleaned, toiletries replaced, which is how it should have been in the first place. We did find the hand basin rather useless - we had issues with the water draining away as the plug did not retract properly and also there was a problem with the hot top - when we switched it on it sounded like a very loud pneumatic drill, which I am sure would have been heard in nearby rooms. Overall we had a really good stay and I would recommend this place - pity about the lazy maid as I would have given 5* otherwise, despite the fact it is a small room, it was nicely furnished.","Brisbane, Australia","darwin1905</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",68,4.0

Wiki defines a Boutique Hotel as ""a term used initially in North America and the United Kingdom to describe small hotels which have typically between 10 and 100 rooms[1] in unique settings with upscale accommodations."" Does small mean ""exclusive"" as in small number of rooms or small sized rooms or both? For this hotel it is at least the latter: very small rooms for the price.The Good:-great location, two blocks from the beach, near some of the best little food stops in town.-great, friendly staff.-good common areas.-room is clean and functional.The Bad:-Not really a great value. I paid almost $300.00 per night for the smallest room.-Parking is valet only at $25.00/ day.The Ugly:-Rooms are incredibly small. Mine measured 16""6"" x 12'2"" (yes, I measured it)-Beds are Queen sized only at 80"" x 60""-toilet is 4 ft from the bed.-hallway is 42"" wide.After the initial room size shock I stayed but if I could do it over again I would stay at the Hyatt for a little more money.

Don't expect restaurants, pools, amenities, etc. but that's what we like about it.When you arrive, they give you pineapple juice and a towel to freshen up. Any time you go to the beach, you can get a boogie board, towels, beach mats, and other things to enjoy the beach for free. It's a short walk to Waikiki beach, passing ABC along the way if you want water/snacks, etc.The location is perfect. Short walk to the beach, rental car, awesome restaurants, and bus stop right outside. The concierge will give you a map when you arrive with all bus info too and how to get everywhere.Breakfast is included from 7:00-9:30, and coffee, water, juice all day as well as microwave and toaster. Really nice for a snack before heading out!It was our honeymoon and they gave us a card and a box of chocolate covered macadamia nuts. Staff is awesome, hotel is clean, but small. But you're in Hawai'i, why do you need a big room? Your days will be spent at the beach and exploring so the room doesn't matter. This place is cheaper than most other resorts (no resort fee either), clean, awesome staff, and perfect location. Highly recommend and when I'm back on Oahu I will be back at the Vive. They even had their concierge book a car for me when I emailed them ahead of time since the concierge (KC) would have been gone by the time we arrived and we needed the car early the next day.

The reception area is quite nicely designed for guests to lounge around in. The location is ideal for Waikiki beach and the many shops, restaurants, bars etc.Our only issue would be with the breakfast, it is quite limited, there are no hot options, cereal or milk. It also seems to run out quite quickly, especially in the last 45 minutes so get down early if you want more than just bread and fruit. The breakfast area is not suitable for eating in and space is also quite limited so if you are staying for a few nights this could be a bit of an issue.We had a number of requests such as use of a computer/printer to print off our boarding passes, use of towels/bamboo mats for the beach which staff were able to provide without any issue.But most impressively, our flight was not leaving until 10pm and with checkout at midday were asked if we could leave our bags while we went to the beach one final time, had a wander around and got a bit of lunch. The Vive hotel went one better, they offered us use of a room for 1 hour as well as storing our luggage while we went out.

I was visiting on my own, trying to keep my hotel expenses down and I was incredibly surprised by the superior quality of my stay comparable to a 4 or 5 star resort and Consistent from the first ""Aloha"" to the ""Mahalo”. haha Making reservation:I made my reservation by phone, I let the reservationist know ""Im visiting Solo and looking for the best price available for that reason"".I was given a nicely modern and refined room down to the sink fixtures. $147 a night plus some tax's. I was given special consideration ( rooms were available ) , $200 was the actual room average ( this speaks volumes about their service alone).I almost felt guilty after the fact I probably should've paid more.To start:I was greeted with a welcoming pineapple juice and cool scented towel presented on a plate at registration. I was in room 1404 a single queen room, roomy and comfortable as well modern luxury fixtures in (my opinion). An I-pad/ tablet was set near my bed said welcome Rachel T********** I found the Tablet useful in may ways, I scrolled and felt connected to the Honolulu atmosphere and energy of the area.Using the Tablet I logged onto the internet instead of having to use my cell phone (very convenient).Every morning starting at 7am ending 9am was a complimentary breakfast.4 or 5 Fresh cut fruits Pineapple mellonsstrawberriesorangesectsweet rollspatries Banana BreadBest of all 24-7nicely brewed Kona coffee(smooth and nutty )+sugar and Creamers(always hot and filled )And Tea selectionsThe person in charge of daily operations is doing an excellent job. Pat your self on the back. I travel and have been lucky enough to experience many beautiful 5 star resorts, where nightly stays are upwards of $500 and Vive's operates at the same capacity. I do believe excellence should be acknowledge and they truly made my stay a great memory and stress free.... haha I stress myself out easily (sensitive to ingenuity) but that means I pay attention to detail consistency and Vive hit all the points and did not fall short.

They were friendly, helpful, courteous and very knowledgeable. At check-in on a hot and humid afternoon, they offered cold towels and cold juice and to store our bags until our room was ready. They could give lessons to other hotels on how to make customers feel welcome.So why not a higher rating? The rooms really leave something to be desired. We like to unpack our bags if staying for more than one night (we were there four nights). But the only drawers in the room were in the pedestal of the bed, against the floor. To use them means getting down on your hands and knees to pull things out from under the bed. That can be a problem for older knees and backs. There were three small cubby holes in the TV stand. But they weren’t big enough to hold many clothes. Also, there was only one luggage stand. So our other two suitcases had to stay on the floor.The TV was on a stand with little room for more than the remotes and room key. There was certainly no room to put a laptop if you want to play a DVD or stream videos to the TV. The desk in the room was also small. There was a similar problem in the bathroom. While the walk-in shower was huge – big enough for several people at once – there was very little space to put toiletries, just one very small glass shelf near the sink. Where do they expect guests to put hair dryers, brushes, shavers, creams, etc?The rooms seem to have just single-pane glass windows. So that means lots of street noise in your room, even on the upper floors. Our room had two window air conditioners that had to run constantly to keep things comfortable. That means they also had to run all night. However, that created sort of a white-noise effect that covered some of the street noise.Pros: Great front desk staff. Good location, just two short blocks from Waikiki Beach.Cons: Very little place to put your things if you want to stay for more than one night and unpack. Street noise due to single pane windows. Noisy and inefficient air conditioners.Bottom line: If I were going back to Waikiki, I would stay elsewhere.",,Abe W,19,3.0

They are really small, but if you are on Oahu and spending time in your hotel room something is wrong with you. It's a quick walk to the beach and they give out towels, beach chairs and beach mats for free-you can't beat that. Another plus, it is valet parking $25 a day but there is NO RESORT FEE. Considering the big hotels tack a $30 fee per day on your stay, plus tax, it can get expensive quick. Vive doesn't have any of the frills, but it really does get the job done. Customer service was great also. One final negative, there is no central air and it's window units. I didn't really mind it because it kept the room cold but I can see why some people would hate it.

It's a straight line walk, which conveniently passes two ABC stores where you can pick up water, soda, beer, snacks, beach gear, etc. The reception area is air conditioned and stylish. The desk staff are so lovely and friendly. On arrival, they explain everything simply and clearly, and thereafter they always make the effort to say hello as you pass. Our room in this hotel reminded me very much of the kind of hotel we're used to in Europe. A modestly sized room with a neat bathroom and a really comfy bed. There's a good air conditioning unit which is a God send. There's also a useful fridge in the room too.A continental breakfast is served in the lounge area by reception and it is awesome!! There's fresh hot coffee (and a variety of teas, including English Breakfast for those Brits who just have to have it [like my wife]), juice and water (available at all times). These are actually available at all times, with takeaway cups which is great. To eat, there are pastries and croissants, etc. I particularly recommend the blueberry toast. To go with it, there are lots of fresh fruit (pineapple, melon, oranges). Beach towels, chairs, Boogie boards are all available to borrow for free if you ask at reception. Let's be clear. Some people will criticise the size of the rooms. This isn't fair and it's not a legitimate criticism, from my POV. We're in Waikiki. You should not be spending much time in the room. The rooms are neat, stylish, up-to-date, well-serviced and comfortable. The en suite bathroom is modern and the water pressure in the shower is excellent. If I try to be excessively critical, the views from the windows are mostly of other hotels and apartment blocks (even then, you do get a good look at the mountains behind and the beach in front).The Vive Hotel Waikiki is great value, in a great location. *Highly* recommended!

The positives. It's conveniently located just a few minutes from the very popular Waikiki Beach and walking distance to many popular shops and restaurants. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We rented a car so we were able to use their valet services for $25/day. The hotel uses a tablet in each room for guests to request services, which I found useful for having our car brought up and ready to go. Since we were still on PST time, waking up at 6am to go hike up Diamond Head was easy for us, but it also meant requesting our car very early, but it was no issue! Another very nice amenity was the free use of beach towels, mats, chairs, and boogey boards. The chairs aren't the most comfortable, but the option was nice. The negatives. Even though the lobby is very nicely done, the room we had felt old. The bathroom was very small and there wasn't much counter space to put much of anything. The paint on the tub was also coming off. The AC unit is a window unit and it's extremely loud. It works well enough, but it will be running all night, so those sensitive to noise might be bothered. It's a constant loud noise, so maybe you can get used to it. I'm usually a very light sleeper and I was able to manage. The bed isn't the comfiest, but it was ok.They do have complimentary breakfast, but we never used it because we always woke up way too early, still following a PST sleeping schedule.

It’s such a beautiful place! We chose the VIVE HOTEL by its reviews in Trip Advisor. It was said the VIVE Hotel was well located, that it was nicely decorated with an inviting environment and that its personnel was nice and the friendly. Everything was true! Even the welcome pineapple juice and the warm and perfumed towels the hotel hostess offer you at your arrival…great to see right what you expect from a place. Even in a sumptuous town as Waikiki the VIVE Hotel does not let you down. Its location and decoration are just great, not luxurious but fancy, and not in the middle of the loud streets but just three blocks far, what is quite convenient. The staff was great, eager to help even with directions or advise. We were more than grateful for the courtesy room me enjoyed on our last day. Our plane left at 10 pm at night, so we made the check out around 10 am, we went around the island in our rented car (I strongly recommend you rent one to see the island around! The views of the island are just amazing) and around 6, we used the courtesy room to take a shower and change our clothes. After that, we left to the airport feeling fresh and happy! Just to point out a disadvantage, I’d mention the breakfast service. Actually, they clarify that is not a service but an amenity. I have a gluten-free diet and the hotel couldn’t provide me for any options, since they just offer you regular pastries, fruit, some juice and coffee. Besides that, we loved the place.

Air conditioning was on all the time as we were hot and it worked well. We borrowed towels and mats for the beach which was only a very short walk away. Close to Food Pantry and 3 ABC stores. The Bus also stops out the front. Juice, tea, coffee, fruit and pastries were also complimentary to all guests in the mornings. Couldn't have chosen a better hotel.

One person must back up to the other side of the room when the other person wants to open the door or walk to the bathroom. However, from what I've heard, most hotels on Waikiki have tiny rooms.

It's 2-3 short blocks straight to waikiki beach and in my opinion, the best spot on the beach. When we checked in, they gave us cold, scented towels to refresh ourselves and pineapple juice. It was a nice little perk. The check in was fast and every person who works here are helpful and nice. The internet is free and it's good and fast. The room is small but honestly it's hard to notice - it still has a desk, fridge, etc. They make smart use of space and it feels nice and cozy. The AC kept the room cool and was not loud at all. The rooms were quiet and clean. The fridge had a sticker that said that it may not keep the food cold enough to eat later so that was disappointing. We had lots of leftovers that would've been great but we didn't risk it We only kept drinks in there. The breakfast was very nice. Coffee, tea, pineapple juice, toast, fresh fruit and assorted pastries. They changed it up each day. Some of the pastries even had meat in them. We ended up borrowing boogie boards, chairs, and towels for the first day at the beach. We ended up buying a blow-up raft from the ABC store a block away and they filled it up for us with air ($3.99) so we didn't use the boogie boards. We didn't use the chairs either. I wanted to have a lounge chair and umbrella so we ended up renting 2 beach lounge chairs and an umbrella for $50 for the whole day. The place we rented from (star beachboys) is right on the beach - a straight shot from the hotel. The hotel also let you borrow as many towels as you want for the beach so we borrowed 4 the 2nd day. When you get back from the beach, there's a basket that you drop your towels into right when you get back into the hotel. It's very nice and convenient. We didn't have a car so we didn't use the parking. The hotel room also had a tablet that you can order more towels, a room cleaning, more toiletries, a cab, etc. We ordered our hotel shuttle on it and also ordered room service quite a few times. It's part of the Waikiki Room Service network so you order from a set list of restaurants in the area and they deliver right to your room - so nice! I've stayed in Hawaii and Waikiki specifically many times and in many different places. We opted for a queen bed room without a view. Now that I've been here I think that was a good choice - I don't think it would be worth it to pay more money for a limited view. Especially because it's so close to the beach - just go to the real thing rather than getting a glimpse from your room. This was our first time at Vive and this will be my go-to hotel from now on when I'm in Waikiki. In fact, when we come next, if this place is booked, I might change my travel dates to make sure I get to stay here the next time I come back.","Portland, Oregon","Haley H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Portland, Oregon</strong>",15,5.0

We did not see any kids in the hotel and although we were on the 18th floor, lifts we quick and easy to access. City view was impressive but we spent lots of time in Waikiki.

On the negative side, the rooms are extremely small and while attempts have been made to update them, they felt tired. There is not enough storage and the bathroom was tiny. There are larger junior suites available but all were booked during our stay. The air conditioning unit was noisy and even switching it off and opening the window still meant that you heard a lot of noise from the other air con units. The view from the hotel was rather grim looking onto another grey apartment block but that is to be expected in this location in Waikiki. We had no balcony. Dressing gowns and free wifi are provided.

We had stayed at another hotel last year on Kuhio Ave. and it was also good value, but the A/C and the street noise was at times too much to bear as we are light sleepers and were always tired after a full day of leisure. We requested a room with quiet A/C and not facing Kuhio Ave (i.e., the quietest room we could get for the room type and daily rate we chose) and the Vive fulfilled our request. It was a very nice room, #702. We had a mountain view but we didn't care because we used our room to rest in. The room had a queen sized bed, a chair, some open cubicles in the furniture for our clothes and two adjustable window screens for filtered light or to black out light. The window also opened manually. The in-room safe was free and easy to use.The free WIFI was the fastest and most reliable we've ever encountered and the wide flat screen TV was almost free of defects (there was a narrow vertical line to the side of the screen) but again, it was a non-issue. We notified the customer service staff and they offered to replace the TV but we didn't feel it was necessary for us. The small in-room fridge was not very cold and there was a sign in the fridge stating this. We did ask for the fridge to be replaced in the middle of our stay but the replacement unit was not any colder. We managed to keep most things cold by requesting bags of ice almost daily, which we kept in the fridge. There is no ice machine, it had to be requested from the front desk staff or via the Android pad used as the room clock and service request device. We tried calling the front desk using the wireline phone but it didn't work. Talking directly to the front desk staff was best and the staff was always responsive and quick to fulfill our requests.The amenity we prized almost as much as the quiet room was the daily continental breakfast, consisting of fresh fruit (at least 3 kinds), non-warehouse baked pastries (savories and sweet), small muffins, fresh coffee, hot water for tea, juice and ice water. There is a toaster oven, two microwaves and a regular toaster. The free breakfast started our day on a bright note leaving us more time to enjoy Waikiki. The lobby/dining portion of the hotel was nicely decorated with comfortable sofas, chairs, cushions and small tables with one long communal cable. The A/C in the lobby was just right.Parking is $25 a day and that prevented us from renting a car for more than a day; we did take the public buses, and going home took the #20 bus from the stop just a few yards away from the Vive to the airport.We hope we will be able to stay at the Vive again soon and will highly recommend the Vive to our friends and family.","Piedmont, California","longtimepiedmonter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Piedmont, California</strong>",3,5.0

The hotel was a lot cheaper than a large majority of Resorts/other properties in Waikiki, so I booked and treated myself to the Junior Suite (only £150 more for the stay).Arrived very late after over 24 hours of travel, greeted with an ice cold glass of juice and a cooling towel. The staff were friendly and checked me in no problem. My Junior Suite was on the 20th floor with a view of the mountains to one side and a view of Waikiki/Diamond Head/the sea from the other.The room was large and well appointed. Big comfy bed, a desk, multiple chairs, a separate wardrobe/storage area and a big bathroom with all the toiletries and a large walk in shower. Each room also has its own Tablet computer with lots of helpful info on it from local attractions to hotel info. Free WiFi is throughout and it was of a good standard. The Junior Suite has two Air Con units, one on each side of the building (the room is on a corner) and they worked very well - although I will say, on the first night, we had exceptional winds outside and they were blowing right through the vents which prevented me from getting any decent sleep. Other than the first night, though, I didn't really have any problems with that. Staff throughout were friendly, and answered all my queries efficiently. After the first night, my room hadn't been serviced so I asked at Reception whether I needed to tell them I wanted it serviced (there's a note in the room stating this) but they claimed I didn't and it should be done every day, and that I shouldn't leave my Do Not Disturb sign out - I didn't leave my sign out, so no idea why it wasn't cleaned. After that it was serviced every day. A continental breakfast is included in the price, the small breakfast area can get very crowded in the morning but I generally timed it well and managed to get a seat. The selection is limited unless you really like your fruit - but it's free, and I just stocked up on pastries instead. On my last night I had to use the Valet parking and this was very easy. Simply drive upstairs and leave it with them, and when collecting my car was ready within minutes. Excellent service, price was reasonable at $25 for 24 hours considering what others charge.Overall, I enjoyed my stay at Vive Hotel. The hotel is nicely decorated, the Junior Suites are well appointed and comfortable, and as I say it was much cheaper than the Resorts (because it doesn't have any restaurants or pools - but with so much to do in Waikiki, you don't need those things anyway!). I'd consider coming here again on my next visit to Oahu.","Sheffield, United Kingdom","DMTaylor90</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sheffield, United Kingdom</strong>",38,4.0

It's 3.00am on a Saturday night and there is heavy construction (drilling) going on outside the window. just spoken to Beverly at the desk who say that it is not there fault they are not doing the construction. The windows do not block any sound so you can hear everything from people talking to the bleep of unlocking cars outside. How are you supposed to sleep with that. The air-conditioning is broken (I reported this the day after we checked in 5 nights ago) but does at least cool the room slightly, unfortunately the rooms are very small and it is positioned so it blows directly at your head and shoulders and is a window unit so again is very noisy. There is almost no water pressure so when you turn the sink on it literally dribbles out and makes a screeching noise. The shower is okay but you cannot move the spray head so it only sprays a little part of your body at once. There are 2 lifts which are used by every guest and worker so there are times when housekeeping on floor 6 will lock off a lift for a few minutes so it can take 5 minute wait. There are some good bits. The furnishings Are nice. The rooms are presently decorated. The fruit at the continental breakfast is lovely (however on 3 days this has not had normal white, brown, or seeded bread (small thing I know but I thought continental breakfast included toast).

Room was really cramped, but that doesn't really ever bother me. Even for a 3-star property, these are spartan accommodations. The noise from the window AC wasn't a big deal, but didn't add any charm. Bed was OK. Furnishings are dorm-like. The walls were a bit scuffed, painted dull colors, and there wasn't any art or a single decorative element anywhere, except for a little print hanging inside the door. The bathroom, though, was pretty bad. Shallow sinks with faucets that are barely high enough to fit both hands under. The shower head needs to be replaced--water kind of sprayed out in a mist, getting everywhere. The finish on the bottom of the tub was literally flaking off as I was showering. Pros: The courtesy room is a nice touch if you have to check out but have a later flight. Yes, it's a short walk to the beach. The lobby is spacious and there are plenty of cozy areas set up for relaxing and conversation. Had I been here for more than one night, I would have spent more time here to escape the dreary room.

I originally was trying to book a room at a bigger chain hotel but it was all sold out. I am glad it was. Vive has great personality, and although the rooms are a little small (it is a boutique hotel, after all), they are very comfortable and clean. Besides, who spends most of their time in their room when they're in Waikiki anyway? The location was excellent, and the staff were perhaps some of the friendliest I have ever dealt with at a hotel; always with a smile and very helpful. I would make Vive Hotel my go-to hotel in Waikiki if I were to return. It also has no resort fees, which is important for me because our company does not allow us to book rooms with resort fees.",Oakland,"Q4676ECsusana</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Oakland</strong>",3,5.0

The room is way too small. I have stayed in a lot of hotels before, from brand names to many boutiques, this is by far the smallest. Some of the room types are bigger but you need to pay extras. I would expect a standard room should not be this room. The sink in the washroom is flat! It is ridiculous, I can't even rinse a cup under the faucet! Also, if you leave the room in early morning and come back around 3 in the afternoon, don't expect your room to be cleaned because that's what happened to me 2 days in a row, even after I complained. I have never had this experience in any other hotels before. Definitely a first in a really bad way.The breakfast is also really limited. If you are going to offer breakfast, at least include some milk and eggs....Location is good, that's probably the only good thing about this hotel.","Toronto, Canada","jackiezzzzzzz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Toronto, Canada</strong>",9,2.0

Great, polite staff. Great location, modern art and decor in the rooms and free WiFi. Many cable and international channels to watch on TV. No hidden fees, no resort fees except the transient tax? Not the hotel's fault there. Breakfast was simple but just fine for free. The coffee and tea available 24/7 was great. The towels, chairs, mats, boogie boards etc were all free to use. Valet was polite and prompt, also cheaper than most but paying for parking is never fun right? Many complain the rooms are small and that the AC is weird on the wall. Yes the rooms are small but the space is well utilized and very modern with a tablet in the room to cater to your needs. Have realistic expectations here, if you are a larger person or plan on staying in the room alot, maybe elsewhere or a suite here is a better option. I found the AC more than adequate and I slept fine but everyone is different when it comes to noise tolerance. If you need a clean modern room with great services and amenities at a value stay here, especially if you are out most of the time and don't need to pay for a huge luxurious room you won't spend much time in. The beach, Marukame, Iyasume Musubi, Food Pantry and much more right in the area! Public transit too. 24 Hour Fitness is 1 block away. A fitness room in the future would be great.

We checked in with a nice man by the name of Sato. He was very respectful and very professional. He even offered us glasses of Pineapple Juice and warm towels, which was awesome. We'd just gotten off a long flight and the juice was very refreshing after being in a dry plane cabin for six hours.Later we got some great travel tips from the concierge, KC. I can't say enough great things about KC. She helped us throughout our entire trip, everything from booking a trip to the Polynesian Culture Center, to helping us rent a car so we could explore the island for a day. She also had some awesome food recommendations.For the times when we wanted to go to the beach, Vive provided free towels, beach chairs and even a beach umbrella.The room we stayed in was very clean and the bed was super comfy.The location was also really great, just two blocks from Waikiki beach. It wasn't right on the beach and the view from our room wasn't the best, but that hardly bothered us.The one piece of feedback I would provide is the continental breakfast was a little weak.

As this was a three-day business trip for me I appreciated staying in a hotel that offers great WiFi coverage, breakfast, and coffee 24 x 7. I was working from my room part of each day in between meetings in town and at the convention center. As well it is easy to get in and out of the hotel due to its size. It can take forever to get to and from your room in some of the massive resort hotels in Honolulu, and they are often crowded and noisy. The staff was super helpful and the hotel is clean and well managed. The Jr. Suite was a good choice as I spent part of my day up at 5 am on phone calls for work. It was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. I slept quite well. The hotel is also close enough to the Honolulu Convention center that one could walk if so inclined, or it is a short ride via Uber. Downtown Honolulu is a bit more of a reach though, but still easily doable via Uber. Traffic in Honolulu is bad no matter what. I also appreciated the many different restaurant choices offered in Waikiki. And take out is everywhere too. I especially enjoyed the Korean short order take out restaurant across the street from the hotel. They offer a huge menu of authentic Korean dishes.

We arrived at 6am Hawaii time after a long flight from Australia. Due to this early arrival time we had planned to ask if we could stow our bags somewhere at the hotel and go out exploring until our check in time later in the day. We were warmly welcomed at the reception desk with a cool scented face washer and glass of fresh pineapple juice, refreshing after an overnight flight! We spoke to the friendly gentleman at the front desk and explained the situation...we were pleasantly surprised when he said that he may have a room available for us so that we were able to check in early without needing to wait around. He was able to allocate a room for us and shortly after we made our way up to level 8 in an ocean view queen room. The hallways were nice and quiet, clean and private. Our room was very neat and clean, a tad small with not a lot of hanging room we found out (for things such as swimmers, towels etc). The items in the room seemed to be of high quality with classy fittings and a modern bathroom. Plenty of linen was supplied and the toiletries seemed adequate. In each room there is a nifty little tablet in which you can utilise for things like requesting a taxi, booking your next stay, requesting more toiletries etc. The FREE WiFi within the hotel is also incredibly useful!The mini fridge in the room was quite small and would only fit a couple of small cans or bottles. The fridge also had a sticker on it warning that it may not maintain adequate temperature and perishables may not be suitable to be put in there, however we found that the fridge kept suitable temperature over the time of our stay which was great. The window air conditioner was slightly noisy at times but not a nuisance (if you are used to the noise of a window aircon then this won't be an issue), it cooled the room adequately and was nice to walk into the cold after a big day of sightseeing! The hotel was in a fantastic spot to catch public transport with bus stops on both sides of the road heading in either direction. ([$2.50 USD one way for an adult] Bus number 42 is good to catch if you want to head to Ala Moana centre for great shopping or the Pearl Harbour Memorial). It's also easy enough to catch a taxi from the main road at the front of the hotel ($45 USD from the hotel to the airport). The hotel is also located only a 2 minute walk from the beach (the hotel supplies beach towels on request).The only thing that I could fault is the noise from the main road, I understand that this is something that's difficult to fix but just a heads up for anybody planning on staying here :) on the other hand, another fantastic aspect of the room was the double blinds on the windows, one for privacy and one for block out, this did help to cut out a small amount of the noise.The continental breakfast each morning was nice with a range of different sweet and savoury pastries, two types of bread, a range of fruit and tea and coffee, available as a buffet all you can eat located down in the relaxing modern lounge area. Checkout was seamless and super quick.Overall, we had a great stay at the Vive Hotel Waikiki and would recommend this hotel to anybody. We will be back to stay next time we are in Hawaii.

We enjoyed much about it. The location was great - close to all of Waikiki, the restaurants and shopping, and 3 short blocks to the beach. The bus right outside would take you many other places, so that was convenient. The downside of that location is that it was noisy. We had a noisy air conditioner that fortunately blocked out much of the street noise, but we still heard it anyway. Some other pluses were the wonderful staff and an okay continental breakfast. There was a wonderful offering of fresh fruits and then some breads and pastries. I would have loved some yogurt, but I don't believe they have much dairy on the island so that was not an option. We enjoyed going to the beach and the hotel provided towels, beach mats, and beach chairs for free. Now the downside - our room was the tiniest hotel room we've ever had except for once in New York City. The bathroom was equally the tiniest. The ""closet"" space was not enough for one person's clothing, let alone two. In addition, the rooms and the halls just look a little ""tired"". A fresh coat of paint would have helped and the bathroom could have been cleaned a bit better. There was obvious mold growing in the overflow valve of the sink. Nothing terribly major..

A little over an hours walk to Aloha tower. One thing that really endeared me to the hotel were both the rooms and the staff. The main thing I looked for when reading reviews was a clean hotel, that's what I got. The rooms are small, but nice. They can easily fit four adults, but only one person per bathroom area at a time. Some other reviewers discussed street noise and WiFi signal issues, I didn't experience any of these on the tenth floor, but I travel with a white noise machine, so take that with a grain of salt. I didn't have a view of the ocean, I didn't specify that I wanted that in my room so it's not a complaint, but this property is one street back from the ocean, so if you're dead set on an ocean view, this may not be what you're looking for.Now to the staff, my check-in time was 3pm, my plane landed around noon, so I figured I'd stop at the hotel and check my bags and walk around for a bit. Instead, Sato and Paul took care of me right away. Sato ""upgraded"" me to a new room that allowed me to check in at noon and Paul was johnny on the spot with a damp towel and pineapple juice. Most of my staff interactions were with these two, and they were awesome people. Every time I had some tourist question, they were always friendly and informative.

He informed me that only a junior suite at about $259 was available for the first 2 nights, then a standard room for the remaining nights at about $151. I asked since I've stayed there before and I was staying for a decent amount of time, could he give me the rate of $151 for the junior suite as well. He said no, but I could go to another hotel and come back in 2 days. I was a little insulted by that and said if I go to another hotel I'm staying there and not coming back. He said he wasn't going to lose his job over saving me $100. I said it's almost 7:30 pm what if you don't book it, then you lose $250? He said that's a risk I'm willing to take. I said that's a nice way to treat a returning guest. Now you lost an 11 night booking. Which when you factor in parking and other fees amounts to about $2,200.I'm not complaining about not getting the room at a discount, I'm complaining about his attitude.

Check-in: All parking is valet only and $25 per day with unlimited in/out privileges. This is not uncommon for the area. We arrived a bit earlier than anticipated and by the time we dropped our car and made our way to the lobby, the front desk had cold scented towels and pineapple juice ready on the front desk counter to greet us. The lobby looked a little worn in places but overall very tastefully decorated and funky looking. The staff were awesome and offered tips for the area. There is a concierge desk as well which we did not use, however any staff member we came across seemed willing to direct us however they were able. The hotel and room: As mentioned above about the lobby, overall it is a little worn. However, I have found this to be quite common for the area and how busy it is. We had an ocean view room. The view was somewhat blocked by buildings ahead of it but you could see Waikiki. The window is high and I wouldn't expect to be able to lie in bed and watch the waves by any means but it was nice to see the ocean. It was very small, but clean and had everything you would need. Decorated very modern and utilized the space very well. Location: Very good location. About three blocks away from the beach (5 minute walk) and central on the Waikiki strip. We walked the area lots and never felt too far away from anything on Waikiki. Value: This hotel included many things that other hotels nearby charged for. There was no resort fee, we had free wifi, complimentary breakfast that had many types of bread, rolls and fruit, and you could get beach towels, chairs and boogie boards etc included from the front desk also. Overall: it's not the fanciest hotel but certainly feels like an upgrade from many others for the price. Would definitely stay here again or recommend for the Waikiki area on a more limited budget.

We used it to arrange transport back to the airport and we were given confirmation in minutes that this had been booked for us. Another handy feature was the fact you can sign up for an hour in the courtesy room on the day of your departure, which gave us time to freshen up before our late night flight to the continental USA.The only thing that I would say is that the hotel should make sure it's postal address is written on all email correspondence. When we arrived at Honolulu airport and got in a taxi I took out the confirmation email and there was no address, nor was there one on the calendar reminder that was uploaded on to my phone from my email confirmation. As a non-US resident I was unable to look it up on anything as well, due to usage restrictions on my phone. So it would be a good idea to note it down, as we discovered our pronunciation of the hotel's name (me and my fiancée are both English) was incorrect and our driver didn't know where we meant until we spelt it out for him!If you are planning to stay in Waikiki, don't rule this place out because it's a resort, the beach is a stone's throw away, there are no added resort fees, and you still enjoy the shops and bars of the resorts/Kalakaua Avenue.

I found Vive to be a perfect place to stay, apart from all the staff being on their game I found it very affordable as to other places I checked out in the same area and Vive will not charge you the ""resort"" fee other places will nail you for. Upon checkout I had a few hours to kill before heading back to the airport, the hotel offers courtesy rooms for free, you just need to book it with the front desk the night before, it's great if you wanna head the beach for a few hours and then take a shower before you head off.

The continental breakfast was a nice assortment of breads and fruit, plus beverages. We have certainly seen more choices at other hotels, but this is one of the few hotels that offers this amenity in this price range. The only complaint, and I had read this on TripAdvisor in some of the reviews of this hotel beforehand, was the small air conditioner unit. It never really kept up with cooling the room. Otherwise, there is free wifi, cozy rooms with nice views, access to beach gear, and a very nice decor. We had a great time and would stay here again.

He even helped us on our transportation to Waikele Premium Outlets at no extra cost. And all our wake up calls are personal, not just recordings.Next, my husband was happy about our room so I had no problems with it being small so long as it was clean.We even got an anniversary card and a small box of Godiva Chocolates on our special day. Breakfast was also okay.Lastly, the location. It was just a minute or two away from the beach and the bus stop to Ala Moana Center, Pearl Harbor, etc was just 7 steps away.

When I told them that our sink was almost clogged, the sent a janitor to fix it right away. The way it should be. We also got som good advice (on restaurants and sightseeing) from the concierge and the rest of the staff. Breakfast: LOADS of fresh fruit: Melon, mango, oranges and pineapple. Toast and toasters, only butter, strawberry jam and peanut butter for breadspread/topping. No cereals, no milk, no full grain, bot loads of croissants, muffins and so on. Best thing about the breakfast: They have one. Loads of fresh fruit. Good Hawaiian coffee. Lovely breakfast room with atmosphere (lobby). Worst: Loads of sugar/wheat. Few healthy options, apart from the fruit. Would I stay here again? Yes. No doubt. Should I go back to Hawaii some day, this is where I will stay.","Sunndalsora, Norway","McSwain</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sunndalsora, Norway</strong>",40,5.0

They were very friendly, helpful and patient. The foyer is very nice and spacious with a few too many Pier 1 wooden animals.CON:The rooms are ""cozy"". English translation - small. They did a good job making them look bigger, but at the expense of furniture and storage space. The ""modern"" furniture is so ascetic, it gives a college dorm vibe. There are only two clothing drawers under the bed (I didn't even find them on the first day), and a few uncomfortable shelves pretending to be nightstands. The only large storage was inside the wardrobe, but with only 6 hangers(2 of which were taken by bath robes), it wasn't of any use.We stayed 15 nights (which means 30 sets of clothes), so my wife lived two weeks out of a suitcase (she's a quarter Gypsy). I managed with 2 drawers and 4 hangers.The bed was rather uncomfortable - too soft, so if you need good back support, stay away. I had to sleep on my side to prevent back pain.The bathroom was smaller than we have at home, in a very poorly designed 15-story 1953 NYC building.The complimentary breakfast is extremely continental (not even a piece of cheese) and is complimentary for a good reason - nobody would pay money for that food. Please do yourself a favor and skip half-baked pastries with what they call ""coffee"" and go for papaya and pineapples, which are excellent.Bottom line: if you are young and don't mind a few inconveniences, Vive is a good choice for a short stay.

We booked the same day as check in and got one of their regular rooms which was very clean (i'm picky with bathrooms).

They had delicious blueberry bread, croissants, variety of fruits, pastries, juices, coffee and tea. It doesnt sound like much but it was great ! they also have comp. coffee,tea and water all day long. The next day we inquired for a free upgrade and the front desk did some shuffling of guests to accomodate my request which was very very much appreciated! We got the junior suite which was very spacious! They also give complimentary beach gear (boogie board, mats, chairs, beach towels) which was amazing! This hotel is only 2 blocks from Waikiki beach and the shopping strip.

Front desk staff very friendly and helpful, and the house maids were always pleasant and cheerful. While room was compact, it was clean and neat, with a comfortable bed and block out blinds (much needed early in morning :-D). Lobby area was setup with clusters of lounges, tables and bookcases in an eclectic style that was nice to just chill out in for a bit with cold water or free tea / coffee. In the mornings the area included an American style buffet with some basic offerings - basically consisted of couple of bread offerings, some pastries and fruit along with the tea and coffee. I found it ok to grab something quick before heading out to explore and to find something more substantial for lunch; however if expecting cereal or hot offerings you will be disappointed. The hotel was on a road serviced by regular buses, within a short distance from a couple of convenience stores and a 24 hour laundromat. Also within easy walking distance were a couple of hole in the wall Asian restaurants for those nights didn't want to go to far. Also only a short walk to Waikiki beach as the hotel is only a 2 blocks from the esplanade and the plethora of swanky hotels and shopping. Only downside was no pool - but then again with Waikiki beach being so close not something that I found to be an issue. Oh and the other delight that I found was so useful and a huge bonus was access to the courtesy room - especially helpful if you have an evening flight and want to freshen up after a day out and about. The courtesy room can be reserved 24 hours before; from memory you can use the room for an hour - plenty of time for a freshen up shower and change of clothes.","Canberra, Australia","CazG63</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",20,4.0

However, there are no dinning tables that you would expect to find at other hotels, so half the people dining were holding their plates in the hands while sitting on the sofa.This is because the area used for the breakfast is used to relax and read/ chill out. If a hotel is going to offer breakfast, than there should be a decent area to eat comfortably. Many people were sharing a tiny table with strangers and they did not look comfortable in doing so.

ON ARRIVAL: When we arrived (At 7:30am) we were greeted by the friendly hotel staff who offered to hold our bags for us and told us to help ourselves to the continental breakfast whilst we waited for our room to be ready and also handed us a glass of much welcomed, delicious, pineapple juice. BREAKFAST: The breakfast itself was pretty ""meh"", it served its purpose having bread and muffins and some fruit but there was no cereal or cold milk. The coffee you could get was out of a heated canister but tasted alright and was available all day, complimentary. Sadly the breakfast was only from 7am until 9:30am which means that my partner and I missed it 3/6 days! ROOM: The staff let us know our room was ready at about 11am after we had gone out venturing, 4 hours before the usual check in time which was really great. The room size wasn't large but it was accommodating, there was enough space to walk around and breathe. The bed was fine to sleep one and the pillows were easy to sleep on as well. The bathroom was medium sized with very little storage, but enough room for basic toiletries. There was a hair dryer provided, as well as things like soap, shampoos and shower gels. The shower had very good pressure and was easy to use. The view from our room, a Standard Room; Cosmopolitan Queen, was average, and was of some buildings and the mountains, but we did book last minute and on the cheap as well. If you request it I'm sure you can get a room with a view. There was also a really nice flat-screen tv (my favourite channel had lots of renovation shows!) in the room as well as a tablet that had various apps and allowed you to order room service from approximately 24 different restaurants which was amazing! The delivery fee was a bit much, but as it was pouring with rain for most of our stay we decided to take the plunge and order some delicious waffles from one of the delivering restaurants. Finally a small fridge is provided in the room so you can put your water bottles and various other things in there also. Overall the storage in the room was pretty bad with only two draws and some pigeon holes but there was enough room for two suitcases and a stand provided as well as a safe and two waffle style bathrobes in a beaurau.STAFF: The staff were very friendly and helpful the entire time, telling us when the bus to the Waikele Outlet Shopping Mall was, directing us where to go and booking us a seat. When asking about an airport shuttle they also booked that for us at the most needed time and even called the company to ask where the shuttle was when they were running 5 minutes late. They even brought our bags up to our room on the first day which was very pleasant. When it rained they let us have one umbrella to share between us (free unless for the day where they put a deposit of 25 USD on your credit card), as well as giving us beach towels for the beach when we needed them.HOTEL: The hotel itself inside was very nice was lovely decor, maybe not ideal to have breakfast there... but the lobby was well air conditioned and the hotel was updated. LOCATION: The location was superb. It was maybe 2-3 blocks/200-300m from the beach. Right out the front of the hotel, cross the road and there's several places to eat (notably a cheese and fast Korean BBQ place called Me B-B-Q, huge sizes, cheap and delicious!!!). There is also a large strip of amazing shops on when you walk right and venture down and if you cross the road there is a shopping plaza. There is a Victoria's Secret, Sephora, Coach, various surf shops, as well as a food court in the shopping plaza, various restaurants, a Forever 21, many high end stores and most importantly a Cheesecake Factory!!!! If you walk much further down you'll come across the Galleria which has a variety of expensive shops (e.g Hugo Boss, Armani, ect.). The beach itself is stunning and the water spectacular. TOURS: Around the area there are lots of tourism booths with people with brochures and even if you just walk down the paths people will come at you with tours, but I recommend you check out several different places and get different prices so you can get the cheapest possible. TLDR;Pros: Proximity to beach, shops and restaurants, service, free-wifi, free breakfast, complimentary coffee, ability to borrow umbrellas and beach towels, updated room, rooms cleaned daily, towels changed when desired, safe in room, room serviceCons: No swimming pool, no gym, breakfast wasn't extensive choice and only went from 7-9:30am, no in hotel restaurant, the curtains in the room weren't black outNote: There was no smoking on the balconies and you had be 20 feet from the front door, so depending how you see it if can be either a pro or a conWe stayed from the 20th of November and checked out on the 26th, 4 of our days rained but we went shopping and on some tours to make the most of our time. Would I stay again? Probably not, I like a little more resort to my hotels but if you just need a place to sleep and eat in some kind of luxury than I can recommend this hotel.","Melbourne, Australia","taylorgerada</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",6,3.0

It was very clean, air conditioned and had bathroom amenities provided. Each room had a tablet that you could either do research on, order room service (from surrounding restaurants that would deliver to your hotel room) and also communicate to reception if you needed to request specific services. I am super picky with accommodation to the point I am averse to shower curtains and horribly patterned (and likely never been washed) duvets. Vive had clean doonas that you know get washed and even though we had a shower curtain it was very clean and had little magnets at the bottom that stuck the curtain to the bathtub so you know it wasn't touching the previous occupants body! WiFi was great until halfway though our stay it stopped working on our floor. Despite a few phone calls to reception, it never got fixed for us. Although it still worked in the reception area, it was abit annoying to have to keep going down there. No resort fees are charged which is great. You can still borrow towels, beach mats, umbrellas etc with no extra charge. Local phone calls are also free. Aircondioner was noisy especially when it rained as it is an old school air conditioner that hangs our the window. It works well, but when raining gets pretty noisy. Breakfast was simple but quite delicious. Lots of pastries, bread, coffee, tea, juice and fresh fruit. More than ample to start the day off well. Location is excellent. Only about 300m down the street is Waikiki Beach. Bus stops are also pretty much outside the hotel so it's easy to get to Diamond Head, Ala Moana Shopping Centre and Pearl Harbour. There is also an ABC store not far to pick up snacks, drinks etc.Valet parking is $25 a day but I think if you reserve the room through the vive website you can actually get it half price. We loved our stay at Vive but I guess the biggest let down for us was the WiFi not working in our room. Would definitely stay again however.

We had booked the King suite and it was pricier, but overall it was a very nice room with obstructed beach view. Upon check-in, we were greeted with moistened towels to freshen up with as well as glasses of pineapple juice. The room was spacious and clean, but if you leave the A/C on next to the bed it was too loud. There was an alternate A/C that we left on and it was sufficient. The room was quite loud with the rain/wind during our trip, especially the water drips on the A/C; I am unsure if this was just due to the strength of the storms. The location was superb, just minutes away from almost everything we wanted to do. Self parking is not available. If you are lucky, you can find a spot on the street or there is valet parking for $25 per day or rated charges per hour. Valet service was efficient and you can also message the valet service to ready your car from a wireless pad in the room. Our stay would have been more enjoyable had our wifi service in room functioned properly rather than having stopped working the second day of our five day trip, so we had to always stay in the lobby to use internet. There was also a false fire alarm at around 6 am one morning of our stay. The pillows also required some getting used to for us as we were used to lower pillows, but overall that did not affect our stay too much. We did appreciate that you can request a courtesy room to freshen up in for an hour on the day you are leaving, as that allowed us to shower/rest prior to our red-eye flight. The breakfast was good as well, with an abundance of fresh fruit, and there is always coffee or tea available in the sitting area any time of day.

Not sure how much the hotel would've costed on its own but the package turned out to be a good deal!We picked this hotel mainly for the location and complimentary wifi and breakfast. That alone was a win since most of the other hotels charged extra for wifi and breakfast. In terms of breakfast they offered mostly baked goods and fresh fruits. There was also pineapple juice every morning during breakfast, which was a nice touch.The bus stop was also right by the entrance of the hotel so it was very convenient to get around. There was a storm hitting the week we visited and the hotel lent out umbrellas and beach towels free of charge.The hotel was mostly blocked by other buildings so there wasn't a direct view of Waikiki beach but from our room you still got to see a part of the beach. That didn't bother us at all though because who sits in their room looking out the window when you could be outdoors in the ocean roughly 2 blocks away?All in all we enjoyed our stay here.

The rooms are not very big and it is located 3 blocks away from Waikiki but you visit Hawaii to be on the beach, not hanging out in your room... save a lot of money by staying at the Vive and not right on the beach. The Free Breakfast provided is very basic but is a nice amenity not found at more expensive hotels. The only downside to breakfast is that there are a lot of seats but lacks adequate table space for comfortable eating. Another negative is the $25/day Parking but with space limited the fee is applicable at most hotels so it's hard to avoid. Join their email list and save 50% on parking for the next visit. There is a Bus Stop right next to the hotel and with a great Bus system it is very convenient because you can ride The Bus all the way from the airport and be dropped off door side without having to change busses.

Our room was spacious, had pretty good views and was clean. I stay in a lot of hotels and this one had a nice feeling to it vs. stock big-brand hotel rooms. The staff was very friendly and helpful at every interaction - although that's my experience anywhere in Hawai'i. The breakfast is free and you get what you pay for.

The customer service you get from this place is amazing. They go ABOVE AND BEYOND to make sure you are happy and comfortable during your stay. Now, keep in mind, you are getting a cheap price which means they have to cut costs somehow. The rooms are pretty small but very modern and have everything you need. If you read the other reviews the only thing people really complain about is this. They really aren't that bad and the hotel does a great job with the space! They are super clean and well taken care of. The beds are CLEAN!!! The breakfast is pretty basic but plentiful and tasty. Also, they have 24 hour Kona coffee for free. This is now my favorite coffee. The only sad thing is we cant get it in Minnesota!! When you go to the beach they give you towels, chairs and pretty much anything you need for free. The concierge, Kasey, really knew her stuff and gave us great suggestions. Chris at the front desk was also very helpful and kind. I honestly could write a longer more detailed review but we just got back from an amazing vacation and am a bit tired so I wont. Bottom line is this is a great hotel for a even better price.

Our bags were taken care of, concierge provided us with a map of the island & we were given directions for some nice places to eat. The staff helped us in hailing a taxi too (we later discovered using Uber is much easier and cheaper in Waikiki so do yourself a favour and download the app).The hotel is two blocks away from the main hub of Waikiki Beach. The Hyatt Regency is on the beach front so you're located about 500 metres back from there. Vive Hotel has complimentary continental breakfast but apart from that, there's no other facilities at the hotel so don't expect anything too fancy. You just get the basics, which to be honest is all you need when there's so much to do outdoors anyway. The rooms are small - we had the ocean view room. It's comfortable for two people but it is crammed. The bathroom is tiny too and your shower is via stepping into a bathtub. We made do with what we had and it was still very clean so we can't complain about anything much other than the space was small. Our air conditioning in the room was very loud... I express 'very loud' - I think this was partly because the unit was old. Each room comes with a tablet including wifi for you to use which was very convenient! Also, complimentary wifi was available for guests too. It's an affordable and central hotel so I would definitely recommend it. If you're ok with being a little walk away from the main shopping strip (about 5 minutes) and the beach (less than 2 minutes) then you'll be fine to book at Vive Hotel. Some restaurants we would recommend within walking distance: - Hau Tree Lanai (book at sunset & expect to spend a little more $$$, it's divine seafood! - Duke's (located inside the Outrigger Hotel, great for the family & serves buffet breakfast - also has live music at night) - Il Lupino (Italian trattoria amongst the main shopping strip, across the road from H&M) - Yard House Restaurant (big sports bar, loads of options and big menu. Great atmosphere and the surrounding street had many food options too) - Buho Cantina (must visit rooftop Mexican at 2250 Kalakaua Avenue, this is again along the main shopping strip. Go for lunch or dinner, you won't be disappointed!)Lastly, we walked to all these places from our hotel and the maximum walk was 15 minutes which meant soaking in the atmosphere and walking off our food.So, rather than go with a really expensive hotel just to be closer to 'everything' there really is no such thing. Waikiki is small. Save your money and book affordable! ",,Bigdog1990,8,3.0

There was also a tablet in the room we didn't try but looked to provide requests for room services , transportation and other services which is pretty cool. Breakfast was a nice start to the day, nothing special but was more than enough for us. It consisted of different breads, danishes, tons of fresh fruit ( pineapple was sooo good) , and muffins. Coffee, tea and water looked to be provided 24/7 .We were also surprised with a complimentary room upgrade and a very nice hand written note with chocolate for the occasion ( thank you!!)As far as the room everything was clean and had a nice view of the ocean. Beds were comfortable, I think we fell asleep at 8pm every night, time difference was a bit killer but we're getting more on track. Oh, and for anyone worried about not being close enough to the beach ( we somewhat were) it's seriously about a 3 minute WALK from front door to sand. If you're looking to head to pearl harbor or other sights the hotel also provided an awesome guide sheet with all the major destinations and which buses to take to get there and to get back. Better yet, the bus stop is 10 feet from the front door. This ended up being very useful for us. ( front desk will help you with exact $$ change for using bus)I'm likely forgetting to mention something else, but it for sure was nothing against the hotel, everything was perfect and 0 complaints from us.

The rooms are also equipped with tablets that provide information instead of the usual hotel room binder, which I found very cool.

The wifi works very well, which was an extreme plus for us, a pair of software engineers.Despite all of these upgrades, the facility is a little dated (like most places in Waikiki) and there were a couple little odd things about the room. The electronic room key card reader usually took anywhere from 5 to 15 tries before it would read the card, which was frustrating.

The concierge is available everyday as well and they were great with transport tips and dining recommendations.There have been numerous comments as to the noisy air con and I do have to agree with that.

We were very happy overall with our stay. On arrival we were greeted warmly and provided with a cool face cloth and a glass of juice. Check-in was smooth and efficient and as we had arrived before check in time, and our room not quite ready, there was no trouble leaving bags with them whilst we went and had a walk and drink for an hour.The room is compact, but I knew that, but was perfectly adequate considering we didn't spend much time there. Some more hanging space would be nice and some drawer space too, as most of our things had to just stay in the suitcase. There is a notice in the room stating that to save the environment, only the towels left on the floor would be changed, so I was very conscious of hanging our towels up each morning as didn't feel that they needed changing every day, but each day we would come back and they had been changed regardless. Not really a complaint more a frustration.We only used the free breakfast a couple of days as we had early tour starts a couple of times and also went out for breakfast, but it was adequate enough to get you going for the day with fresh fruit, pastries, bread for toast and tea/coffee/juice.It was a great price, with free wifi, free tea/coffee/water available all day and free use of beach towels/chairs/boogie boards without the resort fees that other hotels charge.As long as you are happy to have no outside space (ie; balcony or pool) then its a great choice and great value for money. The beach is only a couple of minutes walk away so easy enough to relax there instead of a pool.We had an ocean view room, and were happy with the view considering that it is a couple of roads back from the beach front.Definitely worth considering and comparing with other hotels.","Brisbane, Australia","Janeloz</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",8,4.0

We were on the 27th floor on had a great view of the water. Clean rooms, with friendly staff and strong room wifi. Yes the rooms are a tad on the smaller side, but we tended to be out at the beach or driving around the island. The beds were comfortable and it was well serviced. The negative in most reviews was the loud air conditioning: It didn't bother me, slept like a trooper, in fact a find the distant hum quiet therapeutic! There's an individual air conditioning unit to every room and it's there when you walk in. Rather have one than not. Highly recommend. Two minutes from the beach. Towels and mats supplied. You can't go wrong - highly recommended, would definitely go back. When I consider some of the beach fronting resorts are now charging $600-$700 US a night, I'd rather spend the money on fine restaurants etc thanks.

Very unexpected (I have very little hotel or resort-staying experience) and very pleasant because they knew exactly what I needed without even asking me!I booked the Cosmopolitan Queen suite, and although it's definitely not the most spacious or the most well decorated compared to the other suites, at the end of the day I was vacationing on a budget and I really only spent part of my morning and late evening in the room when I needed to crash. The compact size of the room meant it was quicker to air condition and I didn't have to worry as much about packing for my return trip because there were less areas to clean and double-check that I hadn't left anything behind.The hotel was modern enough to include a small android tablet to request room service, browse the web, and other things like check the weather, etc. And there was free wi-fi, and the wi-fi was actually pretty fast for a hotel! They also had free beach towels, mats, and boogie boards to use at the beach (very handy as I didn't have to pack that in my carry-on), and even a bottle opener and HDMI cable available upon request. The TV was a decent size. What would have really added to the experience would be some sort of sound system in the room (i.e. bluetooth speaker) or a music playlist loaded with Hawaiian music. We would have also greatly appreciated some artwork on the walls or some added visual zest/character like the other rooms clearly possess (maybe a fresh flower for the room?). This one was pretty bare in comparison, but very neat and compact.The one downside of the room was that the AC unit could get loud, and every now and then there would be too much condensation and I'd hear rain droplets from the AC unit from the floor above hitting my room's unit/window. Imagine thinking it's pouring outside when it's actually really sunny. The fridge was also very small, and not that cold, and not big enough to save many left-over meals or store-bought drinks in there.What made up for the negatives was the fact free breakfast was offered from 7-9:30am every day, in a lobby that was nicely decorated and enjoyable to lounge in.

He was full of the Aloha spirit at that late hour. Just what you need after the ordeal we encountered at the airport. KC was helpful in recommending and booking activities, transport and tickets to American Football, Hawaii v Colorado. KC has a bright coloured mohawk. Gotta love a hotel that embraces diversity. Everyone we encountered at Vive Hotel was friendly. I would stay here again without hesitation. You meet lots of different people in the lounge area and that was a highlight. The place lends itself to socialising if you choose.The bus stops outside, pick up location for tours varies so check and double check. Most leave from Koa St outside the back of Hyatt Regency, about a 3 minute walk. Do Not J-walk, it's a $140 fine. You must cross at the marked cross walk at the signal. Activities and most tours start early in the morning especially anything to do with the sea as that's when it is calm. If this is your first visit to Hawaii, take a circle island tour as Oahu is large. You will see the different parts of the island so you can return later at your leisure.

It was hard to come in an out because then we have to tip the valet boy everytime we came back to take a break, so we rarely used the car unless we had to go to an activity outside the vacinity.Pros:Lobby is emmaculate.Free continental breakfast=yum ( however we wanted to try out food outside, so we only had one free day)Hotel is close to the strip which is close to restaurants.Bottom line, I would come back here if I was traveling by myself or I need a room to myself.

Upon arrival you are greeted by friendly staff along with a glass of pineapple juice and refreshing coconut towels. The exterior of the building looks a little old (except for the main entrance) however the interior of the hotel is brand new; everything from the lobby to the rooms are modern and fresh. I had a corner room with a queen bed overlooking Kuhio Avenue and the apartments and mountains behind. The corner room was spacious for the main room with two windows and a small bathroom with a combination bath/shower. The small bathroom doesn't worry me much as it is not like I am spending a great deal of time in there and all I need is space for my shaver and toothbrush; bench space is limited for those with a lot of hair and body care products however. The bed was very comfortable, the TV has a large selection of channels to watch and there is a tablet in the room that acts as a means of communication to order extra amenities for your room as well as a clock. Unlike a great number of hotels in the US I have stayed at this hotel does have an in room mini fridge! For those bringing a large number of clothes that need to be hung there is a large wardrobe for hanging items and plenty of space for baggage. A Continental Breakfast was included in the rate however I did not have a chance to eat breakfast whilst I was there. The only thing that lets this room down is the air conditioning. Window mounted units are used and these seem to be a little underpowered; however blinds are installed to stop the room from getting hot during the day. All staff I encountered at the hotel were friendly, courteous and very helpful.Surrounding the hotel there are plenty of shops, restaurants and bars. Everything from sit down to take-away restaurants are found within a 5 min walking radius from the hotel and there are two or more ABC stores within a 3 min walk from the hotel front door. The beach is only a 2 min walk from the hotel and the hotel does have some beach supplies if you wanted to borrow them from the front desk. For those that wish to shop there are plenty of clothing and general merchandise stores along Kalakaua Ave which runs along the beach as well as along Kuhio Ave and streets in between. The ""TheBus"" service runs from just outside the front door of the hotel and will take you to Ala Moana Centre and downtown Honolulu for a $2.50 cash fare. You can walk to Ala Moana (I did) and it will take at least 30 minutes depending on the route you travel (you can take a direct route or a bit more of a longer route but via the beach).All in all this is a great little hotel with a very friendly team and some great facilities; I highly recommend staying here.","Canberra, Australia","ToddM971</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",24,4.0

Check in at the Vive was a breeze and within a couple of minutes of arrival I was in my corner suite, 1208. I had a partial view straight down to the beach which was nice. The room was well appointed, the bed and bedding excellent. The bathroom was fine and the shower pressure great. As some people have written, the air conditioning units are extremely noisy but within a couple of minutes of putting them on, they do a great job of cooling even the hottest room! I found that if I switched them off just before I went to sleep I was fine for the night so no issues there.You have to take into account the location of the hotel - right in the middle of the action. There are busy streets around the hotel and there is considerable traffic noise even if you are higher up the hotel. The sound proofing with the outside world (I.e. windows) is not the best but bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper. I heard no noises from the room next to me which was great. The hotel provide beach towels, beach matts and boogie boards for you and I found there was never a shortage of any during my stay.The beach is 3 minutes walk away and although I was perhaps there at the busiest time of the year (4th July weekend) I still easily found a spot. I found all the staff helpful and friendly with any interaction and they are to be commended.The WiFi was good throughout my stay.I did not have to wait more than a minute at any time for a lift which was good considering there were only two. Rooms are serviced anytime between c. 8am and 4.30pm but if you need your room servicing earlier rather than later, just ask at reception and they will accommodate this. One of the only negatives is something that I have seen mentioned so many times here before on Tripadvisor about the Vive....and therefore I wonder why nothing is done about it? This is breakfast. Not one hint of anything with protein anywhere. The fruit is lovely but all you have then are pastries. It would not hurt to put a big bowl of 0% fat Greek yoghurt or the likes out to go with the fruit to add a bit of variety and nutrition. I did not have breakfast at the Vive and instead frequented the close and many abc stores for bits of food and snacks. Not the cheapest but very close and the range in the larger branches is amazing.In summary I can recommend the Vive for a stay in Waikiki. If I returned to the area I would have not hesitation in staying there again.

The range changed every day, but you had croissants, toast, savoury and sweet pastries/buns/minimuffins and lots of sliced fruit.

Our wifi worked well, staff helped us with taxis and bus information, and Waikiki is a very short walk away. We never utilised the free beach towels etc but good to know the option was there. The bus stop is 20 metres away for Pearl Harbour/Ala Moana/Downtown etc, and being a main road taxis were going past whenever we needed one so didn't bother booking them after the first night, just hailed one down. For those like us who like to get good walks in, we found it was a straight and easy walk from there to Diamond Head, to Ala Moana, and inland to other food options like Ono Hawaiian Foods. And as a runner I really appreciated the nearby paths used by runners and cyclists a block or two inland around the canal and past the golf course. Highly recommended.","Brisbane, Australia","Lissel A</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane, Australia</strong>",270,5.0

The hotels rooms have AC, which is a definite plus as I hear this is not always standard in Waikiki. The location of the hotel was also a plus - lots of places for shopping and eating within walking distance.The Not-So-Good:The beach that is within walking distance of the hotel is small and not that great. We had a rental car and my husband has been to Oahu before, so we drove about 35 minutes to a nicer beach for our beach time. I think the rooms could use a bit of updating. This might just be a personal preference, but I'm not a fan of carpeting in hotels.While I wouldn't have a problem staying here again, if I had a do-over, I would upgrade to a larger room.

You can read all about them on Yelp, Trip Advisor, tons of highly raved customer rating and honestly, excellence values for money!Here are top 10 reason why I love my stay and you should give it a try. Fresh pineapple juices upon entrance and complimentary breakfast every morning! Hotdog buns, croissants, blueburry toast, coffee, fresh fruits and etc. The breakfast was delicious, and a perfect way to start our day. We haven't stopped talking about how much we miss that breakfast selection! Can’t finish your leftover or having a midnight craved? They have microwaves and toaster! Yup, I did enjoyed the microwaves 5-6 times throughout my stay. #leftoverComplimentary beach gears. Google the rates of renting your own beach mats, umbrellas and chairs… Forget it, you can have this free of charge every day, when you come back from the beach 2-3 times with your wet towels, just pick up fresh new ones at the front desk. There is a bus stop right outside the hotel which can take you to Ala Moana, Pearl Harbour and the airport, and the buses are only $2.50 no matter how far you go. The buses came regularly and we believe great value compared to a rental car. And there are parking spot for bicycle. Distance to the beach, just few blocks away. And it is perfectly located in the middle of the strip, closer to Duke statue and Waikiki beach wall. I thought it was perfect as it is less crowded than main street. Hotel room is newly renovated and updated with modern contemporary design. Love it!5 out of 5 stars from front desk to housekeeping service! Very chill, donw to earth and welcoming environment. Jacqueline the concierge made our stay even better with her outstanding service! Service room : If you are taking a red eye flight back and hotel checkout is at 12pm, you can leave your baggage at the front desk, hit the beach and come back during your reserved hour to get freshen up or nap. It does required 24 hours advance reservation. One of my favorite place is Me BBQ, which is right across from the hotel. Easy, cheap and good. Pricing!!!! After writing through all the things I love about this place and still get to feel good for the price you pay.

We were greeted with a cold towel to refresh out face and a cold glass of orange juice. So nice!! Our room was basic, but very nice and the bad was super comfy. The shower was excellent, and the facilities great, the only downside was the air conditioning unit, it was so loud. We had to turn it off on a few nights, as trying to sleep with it on was difficult. We asked for our room to be serviced on the 3rd morning, and thinking they would service it just the once, they came back every morning there after with fresh towels, and the bed beautifully made. The continental breakfast was nice, basic, with fresh fruit, breakfast muffins and toast, tea and coffee but it was enough to start off the day. They also provide towel, mats, boogie board etc to take down to the beach, and you can have this free of charge every day, so you come back from the beach with your wet towels, and you just pick up fresh new ones the following day!

The fresh fruit and ice cold water on offer was fantastic though.

A two-block, five-minute walk to the beach, close to great restaurants, and near the bus stop. Musubi Cafe and Me's Bar-B-Que (Korean food) were two hole-in-the-wall restaurants across the street that we discovered and loved.Decor was modern and clean. Everything felt so posh and comfortable. The lobby and ""living room"" area were lovely and great just to sit in to eat or read. The rooms, while small, were great. It was just my husband and I so we didn't need a lot of room. It had everything we needed and having a mini-fridge in the room was super handy. We also really liked the grapefruit-scented body wash.We really appreciated having the continental breakfast every morning. Even though it was simple, the variety changed slightly from day-to-day, and it was nice to not have to go hunt for food first thing in the morning. We loved the pineapple juice! We also loved having the coffee, tea, and water available throughout the day. The hotel also provided beach towels, chairs, and mats as well, which was very convenient. Finally, the staff were SO great! Everyone we encountered was incredibly friendly and helpful, from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff. Even if we only shared an elevator ride with them, they were so cheerful and friendly. When we couldn't get the microwave in the living room to work, the front desk staff were prompt in getting someone from facilities to check on it. And when the printer attached to the guest computer wouldn't work to print our flight boarding passes, the staff immediately let us use the computer behind the front desk to print. The only cons about the hotel was not having a lanai (balcony), which would have been nice. I understand a lot of hotels don't have balconies, so it's not a big deal. The other cons would be that the air conditioner is a little noisy (but tolerable) and to have more hangers in the closet. Since there isn't a dresser to put our clothes, it would have been nice to hang up more items instead of leaving them in our suitcase.Will definitely stay here again!",Richmond,"dresseswpockets</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Richmond</strong>",0,5.0

This is the hotel for you. Like everyone else said, it's in a great location and easy walking distance of restaurants, shops, bars and the beach. However, if you're debating between saving some cash or spending just a little more to get you some additional amenities, read on. Here are some things I wish I had clearly understood before coming here. This is my review after staying 4 nights and 5 days during May 2015. Every aspect of our stay fell a little short:- Their standard rooms are tiny. Think Europe, NYC and San Francisco tiny. Had they put a little more effort into room design, the space may have been better utilized. We had to keep most of our items in our suitcase because there weren't sufficient hangers and/or hooks to hang up most of our clothes. We spent most of our time exploring and sightseeing but it made spending the little time we had in the room messy and difficult. - Their bathrooms are tiny and the toilet is literally 3-4 feet from the bed (in the standard queen room). Make sure you are traveling with a tight traveling companion as you can hear EVERYTHING. - The room does not have central air. There is an AC unit that it mounted next to the window and is quite noisy. It was warm a few of the nights and sleeping with it on was quite loud. Also, even when it's off, the room is super loud because the vents of the AC unit let the street noise in. We were facing the main street on the 7th floor and could hear every bus and every car that drove by during all hours of the night. - The mini fridge is not cold. They actually had a sign on it that said not to put perishable food items as it would not preserve the food due to temperature. This was disappointing because we couldn't keep any juice or yogurt in there for a quick snack. - The bed is soft and lumpy. I would imagine importing mattresses into Hawaii is quite expensive and would be cost prohibitive to change out as needed. Who knows how old these mattresses are. Loud noises coming through the vents + poor quality mattress does not equal a good night's sleep. - Lack of attention to detail of the cleaning crew. We only had our room cleaned once during our whole trip (per our request). For some reason they did not take out all the trash or replace dirty glasses with clean ones. This was a head scratcher. - No pool or hotel bar. Why does this matter if you're steps from the beach? After 3 days of visiting various beaches, we wanted to have a lazy afternoon and lay out poolside and have some drinks. Unfortunately, neighboring hotels with pools reserve their pools exclusively for guests which is when we officially regretted booking a hotel without a pool. Overall I'd give this place 2.5 stars. If you read through the other reviews, you'll find lots of comments about ""I got a great deal"" or ""great value"" so the overall rating should be tempered with that context. We go on weeklong trips like this only once or twice a year and are fortunate enough to have a little spending capacity for modest upgrades. Our rationale for booking one of the cheapest hotel options was so we could put those savings towards activities. What we failed to realize was that despite spending so much time outside, we still spent about 35-40% of our time in the hotel room (sleeping, resting, changing, etc). So in conclusion, if you only need a hotel for a night or two, stay here. If you're on a tight budget, stay here. If you work hard and this is one of the only vacations you'll take all year and have the option to spend a little more, I would consider doing so. In the grand scheme of things, it'll be worth every penny.","Orange County, California","Catherine S</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Orange County, California</strong>",10,2.0

The staff were always helpful and friendly to us and delivered their service with a smile.

Bathroom is quite small - bumped against the glass shelf which made my things fall into the basin, also poor design placement as towel rack was placed over the toilet and on one occasion the towel almost fell into the toilet. The shower head is fixed (hot hand held) and very high up so when you turn on the water it hits the tub very loudly.Breakfast was okay - about 3-4 types of pastries (plain croissants, apple danishes, etc), two types of sliced bread, fruit (pineapple, honeydew, rock melon & orange), coffee, tea and juice.

Check in was fast and we were greated with fresh pineapple juice and a cold towel which was a nice touch.

The reception staff had no hesitation in doing so and changed our room to the higher floor.The rooms are good- clean, modern and comfortable. They might be a little bit pokey but that was fine with us as we were out for most of the day. Complimentary breakfast was a nice touch. It was a selection of pastries, breads and muffins as well as juice and coffee. My only criticism would be the lack of fresh fruit available. It was pineapple or pineapple! The staff are super friendly and always greeted you on your return to the hotel of an evening. KC in concierge was very helpful. She gave us some great inside tips on places to eat, particularly the italian place a few blocks away- Arancino and activities to do. Our only other criticism would be that of the inconvenience of dragging all our bags down to reception for check out and to book a cab, only to realise we had to drag them back up to level 1 for the cab to pick us up.I would definitely recommend this hotel, particular for couples. The price is great for the location and what it has to offer. The lack of a gym or pool didnt bother us as there was so much to explore.

They mentioned that they provide free beach towels, beach mats, chairs etc. so we don't have to buy them ourselves. The lobby is beautiful (and always smelled amazing... like fresh flowers) and had an amazing selection of books that we could borrow. Our room was small (Hawaii obviously has limited space) but very clean, stylish, and efficient. We had an ocean view room on the 16th floor; there are a couple of buildings in the way but we could still see some ocean. Anytime we needed assistance with something, the staff were so friendly, helpful, and professional. KC, the concierge, was amazing and not only gave us advice on what sights to see and things to do, but printed out all the driving directions for us. Tyler/Taylor (sorry, can't remember the spelling) was also exceptionally helpful throughout our stay. Mahalo!Note though, that if you have a car, valet parking is your only option and it is $25 per day. This is standard for all hotels (in Waikiki at least, not sure about the rest of the island) so I can't really fault Vive for that.

The Vive is a former condo building that transitioned to a hotel a few years ago.The Big Plusses:1. Great bed. Really great bed.2. Nice quality HD flat screen.3. Excellent, extremely helpful staff.4. You can come back after you check out/before you fly back to the mainland and they'll give you a room to take a shower and change in, so you can have a full day playing in Oahu and get clean and refreshed before 12 hours of flying :)5. Strong in-room Wi-FiSpecial kudos to the staff: great help from the concierge, morning breakfast staff (fresh fruit selection, good coffee, and croissants provided free every morning) was lovely, and the housekeeping staff were all top notch. The hotel provides you with beach towels and beach supplies at the front desk, so you can grab and go the two blocks to Waikiki Beach. You just drop off your damp towels and beach board at the front desk on your way back in. With the amount of traffic and sand, this could generate a serious mess, but the lobby and elevators were continually spotless, a testament to quality housekeeping. Were there any issues? Yes, a couple of issues with my room which was a ""Jr. Suite"" on the 17th floor (chair was broken, things like that) but staff responded and fixed IMMEDIATELY. The furniture and hallways could use some freshening (floorboards, scuffmarks) -- things you notice while waiting for the elevator. The issues I list in this review were far outweighed by the plusses and good pricing for a Waikiki stay.

We arrived to friendly reception staff who also provided complimentary pineapple juice which was a lovely gesture. Our room was on level 7 and it was a corner room facing the street so there was a bit of noise during the night but it is only a couple blocks back from the main strip so this is to be expected. It was bearable though and didn't wake us up during the night. Yes the rooms are a little cosy so if you plan on lounging around in your hotel room this is probably not the best choice. It is perfect for those who want clean amenities after a day out exploring the beautiful island. The continental breakfast was enough to kick start the engine in the morning with offerings of bread, assorted pastries and fresh fruit, tea, coffee and juice. The hotel also offers free use of beach towels, beach mats and chairs, body boards etc which is a real added bonus seeing as your just a block away from the main beach.What we found most helpful was the hotel concierge - KC. It was like having your own personal assistant when looking for things to do or places to visit on the island!! We hassled KC almost every day and the level of customer service was second to none. KC even helped us book a rental car for a North Shore road trip and also our tickets to Hanauma Bay. I strongly recommend speaking to KC before you book anything through other operators.

We tried three times to upgrade to a larger room but were told no rooms were available.On the positive side we found the staff to be pleasant, cheerful and helpful. The hotel supplies a complimentary continental style breakfast every morning which is served in the main lobby. The lobby itself is beautifully appointed with plenty of comfortable chairs and occasional tables, although it did get a little crowded during the 'breakfast rush. Coffee and tea were available 24/7 in the lobby. The hotel is centrally located just a short walk from the beach and the main tourist area. Beach towels and chairs are provided free of charge..Unfortunately in our opinion our room did not measure up to our expectations. As someone else has mentioned, this size room is more suited to one person with minimal luggage.There were only two drawers for clothes and they were under the bed. There were some small shelves scattered around but we finished up having to live out of suitcases. There was one 30"" wide closet with no door (due to space constrictions). Likewise the bathroom had a pocket door rather than a normal one due to its proximity to the bed.One of the most disappointing things for us was the lack of a balcony. This seemed to be the only hotel we observed in Waikiki, that didn't have balconies. This combined with the fact that the rooms single window was relatively small added to the claustrophobic feeling.. the window was made even smaller by the ""1950's"" style air conditioner that is installed. I honestly cannot believe that a modern, updated hotel does not have central air ?.There was one small desk chair provided so our pre dinner drink had to be enjoyed by one person either standing or sitting on the bed. Actually after the first night we took our drinks to the lobby for some comfort.The hotel doesn't have a pool, but that was less important to us than the fact that it didn't have anywhere to sit outside for a little fresh air.Overall a disappointing experience......maybe if we had one of the larger rooms this would be an entirely different review.?","Peterborough, Canada","JBH44</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Peterborough, Canada</strong>",68,3.0

If you want to stay in Waikiki, the location is central, a short walk from beach, shops and restaurants. Downside of this is the noise at night. It wasn't hot, but we ran the A/C just to shut out the noise from traffic and people in the street.Staff are exceptionally friendly and helpful. Our contemporary twin room turned out to be very tiny and bathroom was not cleaned for five days although beds were made up and towels changed. Guest room décor is non-existing (the entire budget for interior decoration must have gone to common spaces. These sport a hodge-podge of all kinds of art which is interesting but not always functional, e.g. in breakfast area). Complimentary breakfast buffet is basic but a nice touch, as are the welcome drinks, and coffee / tea made available throughout the day. Valet parking at $25 day seems a lot, yet considering the overall cost of the room does not make that much difference and for us was well worth the hassle free (and safe) parking in the same building. We had an issue with phone calls made to a toll-free number being charged to our bill, but this was rectified on check-out.Value for money compared to what is available in Waikiki / Honolulu overall is good and staff were definitely great.","Alberta,Canada","AlanErnst2010</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Alberta,Canada</strong>",30,4.0

While all the rest of the world tries to emulate the flavour of aloha with their plastic palm trees and cocktails with the cherry on top, Hawaii makes the cliche authentic.Vive Hotel is not that sort of Hawaii.Located literally one block from Waikiki beach, Vive sits on one of Waikiki's main driving strips and is a comfortable walk to restaurants, local shops and mesmerising views. It offers something quite contemporary and comforting, placing it as a modern alternative to the gigantic high rises and resort style hotels you'll find along the shoreline.Something of a boutique hotel, nestled in the heart of Waikiki, Vive has a lot of strong points that would certainly have me staying here again.Upon our arrival from Australia, we headed straight to Vive from the airport. It was a good 6 hours before official check in time, but we went there anyway, hoping we could store our luggage for the day. However, we were treated by the hotel's reception to a complimentary breakfast, an opportunity to wash up in the lobby's bathroom, stored our luggage, used the boogie boards and beach towels and even managed to organise a rental car through the concierge. And we hadn't even officially checked in yet.They made everything so easy that our introduction to Hawaii was off to a brilliant start.When we tried to tip the concierge (a custom that we're not familiar with in Australia) he gave us some advice on how tipping works and reminded us not to 'overdo it'. This was something he didn't have to tell us, but clearly showed that he understood the issues faced by non-US travellers.During our stay in Hawaii, we splurged at some other top resorts, but Vive provided us with everything we needed to make our stay extra special and I certainly would recommend staying here for anyone who wants an alternative to the busy resort style accomodation, but still wants a fabulous Hawaiian experience.","Melbourne, Australia","ChantalTee</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",98,5.0

Compared to the description of others, our room was a decent size, it was fairly small but more than enough space for 2 people on holiday. The bathroom is also small, with not enough space for toiletries but none of it was a deal breaker.- Strange concierge - there was a girl with a Cherokee haircut, young and inexperienced and she really could not offer a lot of insight on things to do. HOWEVER, they seemed to rotate the person who was concierge and the next day was Japanese gentleman who was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. You expect from concierge to go beyond just answering questions with short answers, which is what she did, and you want them to elaborate which is what he did.- There is computer access in the lobby but you cannot transfer files from your camera to your USB storage device which was a let down and concierge did not to much to help us there.- Noise - even though we were pretty high up, there was quite a lot of noise around, not coming from the hotel. However, you are in the middle of a city so I expect other hotels also have similar issues. However, I do believe double glazing would reduce noise greatly. Window can be opened which is nice to get some air.- No restaurant so no room service but they allow you to order from other places and have it delivered to your roomAll in all, the hotel is 2 blocks from the beach, and a couple of blocks from shops, friendly, safe and cozy.

We arrived well before scheduled check in and the staff kindly let us into our room so we could rest our weary, jet-lagged heads for a bit before heading out to explore for the day.The staff, it should be said, were lovely and helpful without exception.The room itself was tiny, however... really, uncomfortably small. So much so that we were glad to be only a couple of days at Vive for this reason. To give a sense, there wasn't enough room to store our 2 large suitcases comfortably, and there was just enough room to get between the foot of the bed and the wall of the room. The room was simply a bed, a single chair and a wall mounted TV. The bathroom was equally tiny - just enough space for a tub/shower with the toilet cramped up next to it and the small sink. There wasn't even enough room to store toiletries anywhere.On the plus side - we were very close to the heart of Waikiki beach and we spent most of our time outside the hotel. Breakfast was spartan (a couple bits of fruit and pastries). We found that eating down by the water was good.The hotel's little library, boardgames and beach gear are lovely touches. Being able to use the computers and printer were really excellent adds as well.All in all, if we were going back, we'd request a larger room and perhaps one facing Diamond Head as it might be a bit quieter.

The hotel itself is decent enough. The staff is wonderful; everyone was very friendly and willing to help in any way they could. Location-wise the hotel is set off a little from the major tourist trap area. For me, that's a plus. I don't much like over touristy destinations, and Honolulu is just that. You'll find that the Vive, while in relatively short walking distance to the busy areas, it's far enough away that you won't get swept up in a wave of tourists as soon as you walk out the door.For me, the major drawback was some of the design features in the room. I'm a solo traveler, so room size is usually not an issue for me. However, this room was really tiny. It was the size of a child's bedroom. Also, there is a door, a heavy 'outdoor grade' door in the room between my room and the room next to mine. Of course the door is locked and all that, but I could hear the gentleman's every move, phone calls, bathroom trips, everything, while he was in the room. He wasn't loud or anything, there's just a little gap at the bottom of the door that makes the close quarters a little more intimate than i would have liked.Lastly, the bathroom sink had a major design flaw. I get that they were going for a modern design, but the sink itself was a wide square, but only about an inch and a half deep! It made things like brushing my teeth and rinsing the sink out a complete chore. So, would I stay here again? I really don't know. I liked the location.

Many restaurants and shopping stores were within walking distance and the beach was only 3 blocks away. Our room was just perfect. You make the best of what is provided to you with a positive attitude. The neighbourhood is a little louder because of traffic and other uncontrolled sounds i.e. ambulances, emergency vehicles. However, you are in a densely populated area of Waikiki. Beach towels and chairs were easily provided by the hotel. The parking valet guys were very professional and friendly. They looked after our used beach towels and chairs when we returned back to the hotel to drop off our car. (Be sure to have $ to tip them, they deserve it!).Overall, we found our stay was very pleasant. We made a lot of new friends during the continental breakfast. The breakfast provided lots of papaya's, pineapples, melon, toasts, pastries, coffee, tea and juices. ….. we really miss the fresh fruits! Especially the ""pineapples""We were able to stay 10 days because of the affordable rate this hotel provides.

The room (1807) was small but was all that we needed. We had beach views, although they were obstructed by other hotels. The air-conditioning is loud as others have mentioned, and the traffic from below was also quite loud. Woke up a few times from ambulances or beeping on the streets in the night. Overall, we were happy with our experience. KC at the concierge desk was also really helpful and when we hired a car for a few days she lent us the hotel GPS for free which was sweet. The hotel is only a 2 minute walk to the beach, and they provide towels, bodyboards, beach mats and chairs if you want them. The breakfast was pretty basic but it was all you need really - toast, muffins, american style coffee, fruit, juice, pastries etc.The hotel was very clean and modern. We spent the majority of our time outside of the hotel too, so it was perfect for us. If you want a hotel that you can spend time in with restaurants, bars, and a pool - then this isn't the place for you.

Every staff member was friendly, professional, and helpful. #2: Location. Only 3 blocks from the beach and easy access to dining and shopping. #3: Modern, updated decor. The lobby is beautifully decorated and the rooms have had some upgrades, although the quality doesn't compare to the lobby. Now for the reasons I won't stay here again:#1. ANTS. I did not bring food into my room when I arrived, but within minutes I started noticing them on the desk and nightstands. I alerted the front desk, who sent up housekeeping within minutes to spray everything down. However, the ants did continue to come back and I even found a few on my bed. I could not keep any food in my room because I knew it would have been worse. Every time I ate, I had to put it in a back and leave it outside. #2. Very small room and tiny bathroom. There was no dresser or drawers available. The bathroom had no area to lie beauty products on other than one very thin glass wall shelf. I had to use the sink when using the dryer and curling iron. I think I had a basic room and you may get more space in a deluxe room, but I have never stayed in such a small space before. #3. Loud window A/C units. I did read about this in another review, but wasn't sure what to really expect as some people are light sleepers. But you do need to be aware that at least once an hour it vibrates the room and makes a very loud noise for at least 5 minutes. So much so it woke me up several times a night, every night. Bottom line: It is a decent hotel in a great location. If you're traveling alone and need only a bed, this could work for you. However, this room would not work for more than one person.

Closer by, there are other eateries, as well as a couple of ABC stores. The hotel is also not far from Marukame Udon, which we highly recommend. Although there is a good variety of restaurants in very close If your situation permits, I would suggest venturing further into central Waikiki to find somewhere to eat. - Staff service and facilities -All staff we interacted with, from the receptionist to the bellboy and valet parking attendants, were all very friendly, helpful and genuinely welcoming. Coming from a non-tipping-service-culture, this is the kind of service that I do not mind tipping for. I also did a bit of online shopping and had it sent to the hotel, who kindly kept this for me until check-in.- Complimentary breakfast -The complimentary breakfast was simple but great for a complimentary breakfast. The spread consisted of pastries, fruit, and Hawaiian coffee and teas. Good enough to get you started before a day of sightseeing.- Room -Our room was on a high floor and had view of the ocean. It's important to note that the hotel is located a two or three blocks back from the beach, so while you can see the ocean, it may be slightly obstructed by other buildings. Nevertheless, this is better than a non-ocean view room. It's up to you to decide how much you value the view and how frequently you will be in the room to justify the extra cost. Should you stay here?Considering the price, location, service, and close proximity to Waikiki beach and action at Waikiki, I can recommend this hotel for people who want a clean and central place to stay and will be out of the room for most of the day.","London, United Kingdom","maarcus</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>London, United Kingdom</strong>",13,5.0

Only downside I really found during my stay was parking. That was if you had a car with you, which I had a rental car with me. Quick solution to that? Park somewhere along Ala Wai Blvd. Its about 2-3 blocks away walking distance from the hotel, but worth not having to pay $25 valet parking at the hotel. I stayed two nights and avoided having to pay that fee for the two nights by scoring free street parking.

It was a great choice for us! We arrived early and just wanted to stow our bags while we grabbed a late lunch and checked out Waikiki. We were immediately greeted by friendly front desk staff with cold pineapple juice and wet towels to freshen us up. Then, we were upgraded to a bigger room with a beach view that was available immediately! I can't say enough good things about this hotel, especially considering the price! Clean rooms, top notch staff, a great continental breakfast and three blocks from the beach and about five blocks to some serious shopping. I was even able to swap out the paperback book I finished with another from their library. Other attractions, like the zoo, aquarium and restaurants are an easy walk.My only critique would be of my first impression when we walked in the lobby. With techno music thumping over the intercom, the decor and all the staff dressed in ultra-trendy clothes, it seemed like it was trying way too hard to be chic and modern. I felt like I was in a SNL skit and that Fred Armitage was going to greet us at the concierge desk with some wickedly funny quips. At that point, I really wondered if I'd steered us wrong booking here. But first impressions aren't everything,stay and the rest of our was excellent. I would highly recommend the Vive!","Boulder, Wyoming, United States","Teresa M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boulder, Wyoming, United States</strong>",8,5.0

The room we stayed in was comfortable, and nicely appointed. It had all the amenities one would want. This hotel is not a resort, so it has a different feel than some other places. I have stayed in several resort hotels in Hawaii and while this hotel does not have those resort features it makes up for this in the nice rooms, great location, and staff that make you feel at home. The staff separated this hotel from others in my opinion. They were accommodating and helpful in every respect. The hotel provided a small oasis from the bustling of Waikiki, which I could access at anytime if desired. It was in close proximity to restaurants, shopping, and two short blocks from the beach. Once you head out of the hotel you can see the ocean. I enjoyed having a quiet retreat and not being over run with lots of other tourists in this hotel. Even though resorts have some different features those hotels can feel impersonal. I enjoyed receiving a warm welcome from staff each and every time I entered the hotel. I would return to this hotel again, and appreciate the attention to small details that made myself and daughter feel welcome. They also were able to arrange a shuttle to get to the hotel for $12 per person to (or from) the airport (which is better then the $45-50 taxi ride).

When you book tours at the Hyatt (just straight up toward the beach from the Vive - 2 blocks) the bus picks you up at the Hyatt which is very convenient (tour desk on Hyatt 2nd floor).Vive has free beach chairs, mats, etc. Which is great. Just ask at the desk.Also on the day you check out - you can reserve a courtesy room for an hour to clean up before you leave to the airport (our flight was a 9pm so that was really helpful).I loved this hotel!

Our bathroom was a total nightmare - the showerhead shot water out the side so the entire bathroom was drenched after each shower; the toilet seat was broken; and it took 3 days to get the plug in our basin fixed after it was stuck shut.

But, it is convenient to a great section of the beach and lots of shopping a few blocks away. Authentic eateries can be found close by too. Buses conveniently pass by in front of the hotel for those who are taking a bus to get around, and if you have a car, plenty of parking in the parkade. One thing that I have to make a special note of, is that the front desk staff were very friendly and helpful without being pretentious. I really liked the fact that everything that we needed for the beach was provided by the hotel: towels, beach chairs, boogie boards... Major points for service to Vive Hotel.Although my room was clean and neat, I found it very small and no view at all - so the blinds were kept closed the whole time. I really missed having a balcony. It would have been nice to relax with a glass of wine and a fresh breeze on my face. My room just felt too claustrophobic to really be enjoyable, and there was a certain amount of noise from outside from time to time, but nothing extreme. In the room there was a fridge, good desk area, the bed was very comfortable, and a good shower.It is nice that they provide breakfast, but it is a typical continental, which is fine for some, with good coffee and juice and lots of fruit. There is plenty of seating too in a variety of arrangements, which makes this breakfast room very pleasant. I felt comfortable in the environment of the Vive hotel, which as a single female traveler, was a major benefit. Again, thanks to the lovely staff.","Calgary, Canada","DIane K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Calgary, Canada</strong>",106,4.0

Reception staff were friendly (especially a young Australian female who was beautiful). Upon entering my ocean view room immediately I got a great glimpse on both sides of the city and ocean!! Room was spacious and bedding was comfortable! Room service would come around twice a day should they miss your room for bedding sheets, fresh towels etc. Would recommend Vive to any individuals/Families who are after value for money!! and a hotel that is central to the main strip!

Thank you Hawaiian Airlines - GREAT advice.The easy taxi ride delivered us directly from the airport to level 2 at the Vive Hotel Waikiki - and we checked in and were in our rooms, in a matter of minutes.I was on level 20 and the room was exactly as I would have liked - especially for business travel as there was plenty of room to meet with colleagues AND enjoy both the great view of the beach (and most of Diamond Head) and the location. The Vive Hotel is a very easy walk from the ""centre"" of Hawaii and of course on the bus routes to Ala Moana etc! It is a very convenient location.Vive Hotel is one block back from the beach - and while there is no pool at present - who would want a pool when Waikiki beach is both that close and so very Hawaiian!The Vive Hotel staff were fantastic - Friendly, helpful and attentive - and nicely ""chatty""...Check-in , concierge services, breakfast service and most importantly the daily servicing of the room by Vive Hotel staff was simply outstanding.Complimentary breakfast each morning, was light, delicious and presented in a manner that allows all the guests to enjoy a relaxed and delicious start to the day. I am a light eater, and found the breakfast each day set me up for most of the day. A nice touch!I do not have the best eyesight - and I would have liked the option of more light in the bathroom, but that is just me! I just left all the blinds up during the day and there was sufficient light most of the time!Importantly, I (sadly) spent quite a lot of time in my room working or meeting business colleagues and customers. the WIFI is fantastic - Fast, Free of Charge and easy to set up. This to me was a key sell point, on top of all the benefits as to great rooms, relaxed but chic surroundings in the public areas, and of course great staff and location. If in Hawaii on vacation I would still want to use the great WiFi at least some of the time - so this is an important offering!I am returning to Hawaii and the USA in the course of business and will be using both Hawaiian Airlines and Vive Hotel Waikiki as the core components of any travel to the USA that involves Hawaii.I recommend the Vive Hotel Waikiki to both leisure and business travellers - It is a great hotel, great location, enjoys wonderful staff and has it all in my view.

First the positive...the hotel is in a great central location; the refurbishment modern and trendy; and facilities great e.g. the complimentary breakfast included, free WiFi (a must these days), complimentary guest computer and concierge. We were on 17th floor so didn't experience any street noise. On the negative side...despite the refurbishment the hotel is still fundamentally an old design building with no balconies that I could see and narrow windows in the rooms which can't be opened. With no natural ventilation and the rooms themselves very small, the confined space becomes a little sweatbox in warm weather. Our room was fitted with air conditioning but it was the old-style ""window rattler"" and quite noisy. Having the air-conditioning running is a must because of the poor air circulation, otherwise the room gets too stuffy. The downside of this is that it is almost impossible to sleep at night because of the noise. The only other significant annoyance I had was with the bathroom vanity basin. Whilst it was trendy and modern, from a practical point it was useless. The basin took up the entire space and had no depth. There was insufficient space on the basin to rest your PC items like razors, hairdryer, deodorants etc. And it wasn't possible to get a decent fill in the basin with water. The in-built plug system would not seal properly so water would continually drain away.","Sydney, Australia","Letherlil</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",12,3.0

It is in a great location just two blocks from Waikiki beach. On arrival we were given glasses of pineapple juice and facecloths to refresh ourselves. We had two rooms, both were modern. They weren't huge but they were fine, each having a double bed, lockers, widescreen tv, wardrobe and desk as well as ensuite bathrooms. The staff on reception were superb, with advice and help on where to go. In the evening, on returning, they would always ask how we got on. If you want to go to the beach, they will give you towels to bring at reception and then you just return them. Breakfast is included, it's nice, croissants, pastries, bread for toasting or just eating, fresh pineapple, melon and other fruit, juice, tea and coffee etc. The hotel is a boutique hotel, the reception is modern as are the rooms. There was a concierge who booked trips if you wanted to take an organised trip. The bus stop is just a few yards away on both sides of the road. The hotel have a map with the numbers of buses and where they go to. We hired a car and parking in the hotel is valet only, at 25 dollars per day. However, we found this quite convenient. There may be on street parking but we didn't bother looking for it. We found this hotel great value for money, excellent customer service, very friendly and in a great location. All the restaurants, shops and beach of Waikiki are literally a few minutes walk which is great. We loved this hotel. I would highly recommend it to anyone going to Waikiki. My husband booked it online but I think the rate compared very well to other hotels in the area. By the way buses charge a flat fee of 2.50 dollars for adults which is very good. Have exact coins or notes with you if using the bus. Oh, rooms also had fridges and we had free wifi also. There is nothing about this hotel that I can fault. It is one of the nicest I have ever stayed in. On our last day, our flight out of Honolulu was late evening. We were able to leave our luggage and our car at the hotel until we had to go to the airport. They told us if we wanted to return during the day and have a shower there would be no problem.",Dublin,"LesleyDublin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dublin</strong>",122,5.0

For 12 nights/13 days, non-stop round trip flights from JFK, and hotel/airport transfer, we paid less than $4,000!!! We couldn't pass up that deal! The hotel was perfect for us. It doesn't have a pool or restaurant, but does offer free breakfast daily which consists of fruit and pastries. The cinnamon rolls were quite good. They also have coffee and water available 24/7, as well as a microwave and toaster. I had some leftovers one night and they gave me a plate and utensils to heat it up. The staff was very accommodating. A lot of people questioned us about the lack of a pool and restaurant when we told them about the hotel. With a short (2 min tops) walk to Waikiki Beach and so many restaurants nearby, you're not missing anything. The only thing I wasn't completely thrilled with was the lack of space to unpack. I like to put all my stuff in drawers and take everything out of my suitcase, and I had to move some stuff around to do that. They have a closet, 2 night stands that have shelves, and some shelving in the closet. My boyfriend and I were both able to completely unpack with no problem, but just know that your clothes will be out in the open. This hotel is the perfect location. You're 2 min from the beach, all the restaurants, and central Waikiki, and there's a bus stop right outside, as well as an Enterprise place down the block, if you want to explore other parts of the island.

It is centrally located and the beach from this literally right out the front door and down the street. You are there in way less than 5 minutes unless you are real slow. I rented a bike for the week so I went to many of the attractions via bike. Diamond head is about a 20 minute bike ride from here. The morning continental breakfast was good and a quick way to get the morning started with fresh pine apple juice and a variety of pastry as well as fresh fruit (water melon, cantaloupe, honeydew, and pine apple). When you first arrive they give you fresh juice and a cold towel which is nice to revive from a full day of travel. The service at this hotel is second to none in my opinion. I have heard some say the rooms are too small. I say they are just right cause I was only there to sleep and eat breakfast and that was it. I did not hear any of the noise that I noticed other reviews had mentioned. There were a couple of days where Hawaii-50 was supposed to have been filming on the street directly in front of the hotel but I did not get a chance to check it out. So every now and again I would hear sounds like guns being fired which I assume was part of their filming during the day but this is not the hotel's fault and was kind of cool. The rooms at the Vive are clean and well maintained and did not have any maintenance issues during my stay. Also the staff was very nice and friendly.The concierge was very helpful in setting up transportation and tours especially to Pearl Harbor. They recommend just taking a tour bus then you can pick your own specific tour when on-site. This is a great way to do this. That way you don't end up with tours and you don't want feel obligated to take since you paid for a “package”. The tour choices on-site were: USS Arizona Memorial (free) and Mighty Mo (25 bucks) and US Bowfin (25 bucks). Took both the Arizona and Mighty Mo tour and they were fascination and each took about 2 hours to complete. The Done Tours that the concierge also recommended is a great way to see the entire island in a day including Hanauma Bay which was spectacular BTW. You can get to the Iolani Palace (the hotel concierge recommended this too) on bike in about 25 minutes. It is a nice tour of inside of the palace and the famous statue of King Kamehameha as seen on TV is right across the street (see photos) I was apprehensive about booking at the Vive since I had never been to Waikiki before but it turned out out to be a great decision and I will definitely be back soon. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to a friend to family member.","Fort Lauderdale, Florida","Lowkey2357</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Fort Lauderdale, Florida</strong>",83,5.0

The street I live on is much louder. With only a short walk to the beach, there are no complaints about location. It is pretty close to many restaurants, fast food and shops. There is also plenty of night life around, if that is your thing. The complimentary breakfast was pastries and juice. If you are on a protein diet, you might want something else, but I found it satisfactory. The breakfast is served in a large room with tables, chairs and couches.

We were able to book with a Military Rate and got an even better deal for booking over the phone (FYI) My husband and I had a great 7 day stay at Vive Hotel Waikiki. For the first 6 nights (our original booking) we stayed in a Cosmopolitan Room. We expected a small room based on the description from the Vive website and from reviews on trip advisor. Therefore were not disappointed when the room was in fact small!(It was actually quite comparable to the size of rooms at European hotels I have stayed at). It was important that our vacation to Waikiki was affordable and the cosmopolitan rooms at Vive allowed us to visit Waikiki without incurring a huge expense for excess space that we didn't need! We are not the type to stay in our hotel room while visiting such a beautiful island - but if you like to relax and lounge in your room, you may want to book the Junior Oceanview Suite. We stayed in one of these suites on the 7th floor for our last night at Vive and it was much more spacious than the Cosmopolitan Room. The shower in the suite was also fantastic! The WIFI and the Air Conditioning worked wonderfully. As other guests have stated, the Air Conditioner is loud - but it cooled the room down significantly once you change it from the ECO setting. Valet service worked wonderfully and our room was always clean. I was shocked to read another TripAdvisors comments stating that Christopher ""lacked people skills"". I had the complete opposite experience at Vive and found Christopher to be the most outgoing and friendly staff member during my stay. He recommended various restaurants, explained bus routes and greeted my husband and I with a smile and a friendly greeting each time we entered or left the hotel. His hospitality made us feel very welcome at Vive. Thank-You Christopher! Things I would tell my friends: 1) Breakfast is very light - think European Continental - fruit, bread, croissants, juice, coffee 2) Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper - the bus that stops in front of the hotel is very loud3) If staying in a cosmopolitan room, ask housekeeping for extra hangers. We found it very hard to organize our clothes, dry our bath towels/swimsuits etc. without them as the room does not have many places to hang clothing4) Eat at Hy's next door (Wonderful steakhouse) 5) Stay at Vive!","Dartmouth, Canada","Jenn H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Dartmouth, Canada</strong>",6,5.0

It was a good experience. The rooms were clean and updated. The furnishings and decor were pleasant and modern. The lobby and ""living room"" were chic, well-appointed and welcoming. The service and amenities were great. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The hotel provides beach towels and all kinds of beach equipment that we checked out at the front desk. There is also a convenience room that we were able to reserve for clean up after a trip to the beach between check out and the time we needed to head to the airport. The continental breakfast was good, but lacked protein. The valet parking was easy. Our car was always ready by the time we got to the parking floor. The surrounding area is classic Waikiki - high rise hotels, shopping (from upscale to flea market) & restaurants. Coconut Cafe is directly across the street and has excellent shave ice. The front desk clerk recommended several restaurants within walking distance. Our favorite by far was Marukane Udon Tempura Musubi - worth the wait. It was an easy walk, also, to Waikiki Beach.

My wife and I rented the suite. The suite is nice and roomy. The shower is huge. Some people will say who cares where you sleep, your not going to spend much time in your room. Well, when I rent a room, I want it to be as comfortable as my house, if not more. I'm a Marriot man by choice, but for the cost of a non-suite at the Marriot, I got a suite at the Vive at my wife's request/demand..lolCons: fridge - keeps my beer lukewarm warm. I advised guest services. I don't know if they came, but my beer is still like warmIce machine: There is no ice machine. You have to call guest services and they will bring up the ice..WHAT?? With 20 floors to this building, they can have at least three ice machines. One on the fifth, tenth, and fifteenth floor. parking - 25.00 a day. I was told this was the norm. Well my question is..do you have to follow the crowd? How about 25.00 for the week. That way, i'll feel more obliged to tip the valet person.Pros: location is about 70 yards from the noisy beach. The employees are great!! The complimentary breakfast is fruit and Danish. Fellas, if someone offers you 3 Vive Hotel pineapples for your wife fiancé, girlfriend , take it. These pineapples are to die for. With 3 pineapples you can save two and trade one for a new woman... lol.The hotel is clean and comfortable. This is not a five star hotel. There is no bar, no pool, and no fridge for that matter.Now how would rate this hotel..... cleanliness... excellent, location..excellent sleep quality... excellent value and service also excellent. Would I stay here again..only if my wife is up as I am making the reservations. I'm spoiled by the amenities of the Marriott. Don't get me wrong, this hotel is good, but lacks the umph of a Marriott, Hilton. The EMPLOYEES make this hotelHere is a great analogy. This hotel is a Days Inn on steroids. Wait a minute.Wrong analogy. The Days Inn have an ice machine, a pool, and a working fridge. Idk....Ok, I've been here almost a week, and I haven't regretted it. I'm comfortable and happy.

From certain other reviews, it seems like some people have the wrong expectations before showing up... so to be clear, this is NOT a 5-star luxury resort. If you want the real high-end stuff, right on the beach, in Waikiki you're gonna have to fork over the big bucks. For those who don't need the most expensive place but still want to be decently comfortable, this is a very good choice. Besides being close to the beach, it is also pretty close to convenience stores, cafes/Starbucks, car rental (at the Hyatt building) and yummy restaurants. There is some great pizza at Lovin' Oven inside the Aqua Bamboo hotel across the street. The friendly front desk handled check-in smoothly, and can provide towels and basic beach gear for free. There is a handy desktop PC on the ground floor. I had a queen bedroom, which had an adequate amount of space for 1 person, and had a decent view out towards the beach. Room cleanliness and housekeeping seemed fine. The bathroom sink area is a bit small, and I didn't like that the storage shelf is pretty high, but the bathtub is fine. Plus, there are some good bathroom products (The Archive). Free Wifi worked well, as did the AC. The small fridge came with 2 free small bottles of water. The TV was decent size and had a surprisingly decent number of channels. The staff responded quickly when I asked for an iron and board. No problems with noise from other guests. I had no issues with checking out. I had a rental car for 1 night, and there is valet parking onsite, which was quite satisfactory and friendly. The price seems like the norm for this area. The included breakfast is pretty basic and just OK, more continental style with some breads and fruit. But the sitting area is pretty comfortable and spacious. There was some construction going on inside, which occasionally had some noise in the daytime, but really wasn't too bad. This was definitely a great stay and I'd seriously consider returning the next time I visit lovely Oahu.","Kirkland, Washington","GMK1954</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kirkland, Washington</strong>",71,4.0

We've been to Waikiki quite a few times in the past and have always stayed at hotels that are closer to the ocean and have more of a resort feel. I knew that Vive Hotel was not a resort, but was I wasn't expecting it to feel so un-Hawaiian. The hotel was clean and modern, but it could have been located anywhere in the country...there was no Hawaiian feel or decor anywhere to be found. There's nothing in the place that says ""You're in Hawaii!"" I'm sure that works for some people, but my wife and I found this to be a big downer. Our room seemed smaller than any other hotel we've stayed at before. That didn't bother us too much though. The bed was very comfortable and everything seemed to be super clean. We did find ourselves longing for a balony/lanai so we could walk outside and enjoy the breeze and fresh air. We also found the sink area in the bathroom to be awkwardly small. I bumped my head on the shelf several times due to the tight layout.The best part of our experience at Vive Hotel was the great service we received. The people there are very friendly and accommodating and always seem to have smiles on their faces. The worst part was that our room was located in an area of the hotel that was under construction. The carpet in our hallway was covered with plastic for the entire week we were there, making it seem like we were staying in a construction zone. Also, there were sounds of drilling and sawing coming from the rooms across the hall from us on a few days we were wanting to sleep in a little. So, in summary, the place was just not for us. It would have gotten a 4 out of 5 if it weren't for the construction zone feel of the room we stayed in. If you're looking for a clean hotel that has a modern feel and is centrally located, then this place is worth a try. If you prefer a more Hawaiian-feeling hotel for your Hawaiian vacation or if you prefer a normal-sized room or lanai, then this place is not for you.",,Kristopher P,3,3.0

Good location to head off on adventures as you don't get stuck in traffic like other hotels, but bus stops are near by too if your not renting a car. I have stayed at a few boutique hotels in Waikiki and this one I feel has the best value for all the amenities included. As other travelers mentioned, the rooms are on the smaller side, but who wants to stay inside while vacationing in Hawaii anyways.

The two rooms were very basic and clearly renovated within an older feeling building, but modern furnishings with all the basic complimentary toiletry needs. The view from the room we had were facing other apartments, but it did not feel too obtrusive and certainly not close enough to block out natural sunlight shining into the room windows, so that was good. Light breakfast consisting of a variety of pastries, fresh fruits and juices including tea/coffee was just right for a quick breakfast.Location is very convenient and walking distance around the area, only two blocks to waikiki beach, one block from the strip of shops and on the same street where major buses run either to Ala Moana shopping mall or towards Diamond Head or beyond. I would consider staying here again.","Taipei, Taiwan","Yvonne K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Taipei, Taiwan</strong>",71,4.0

The hotel itself looks fairly new and is clean and tidy and has tasteful modern décor. The cost was approximately $500 (NZD) for three nights for a standard room on the 20th floor with ocean glimpses. The hotel is situated about two blocks back from the beach and there are a couple of high rises in front of it. The Best thing: - The staff. They were at all times polite, friendly and helpful. The Worst thing: - Street noise was clearly audible and made it a little difficult to sleep (my partner and I are both quite light sleepers). Not really the hotels fault as it's so close to the hustle and bustle of Waikiki and on a main road but if that's a huge issue for you you might want to pay to stay somewhere a bit quieter. General points of note:The rooms are small. We had a king(?)size bed, bedside tables, a long desk with a tv, writing space, minibar, two chairs and a wardrobe with basically just the space you need to move comfortably around. The bathroom was bath/shower, toilet and vanity with standing room only for one person haha. As long as you don't plan on spending your entire holiday in Hawaii in your hotel room and your not trying to fit a family of 5 in there I don't see any problem with the size of the room. There is a safe in the rooms. Valet parking is $25 per day. We didn't have a car so this wasn't an issue for us. Breakfast was just the basics - tea, coffee, cereal, toast, melons/pineapple, mini croissants. Overall I would definitely recommend the Vive Hotel to anyone who wants to be close to Waikiki beach for something in this price range. I've paid more to stay at far worse places. I would definitely stay again. ","Auckland Central, New Zealand","Rochelle K</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Auckland Central, New Zealand</strong>",3,4.0

The good points to note are its location, cleanliness and, most of all, its service. Whilst not being a beach location, it is only a few blocks away from the beach, plenty of ABC stores and food options near it. The place is clean and obviously very new. The lobby and lounge is modern and fresh. Common areas on the floors are a bit sparse, but still clean. Rooms are modern and clean as well, with basic needs catered for in the room. The staff here are super helpful, friendly and efficient. The best feature of this place and really wish I could give a higher rating. Another thing this place does provide is complimentary breakfast, including juices and a continental breakfast buffet with a small selection.On the down side, I do think the prices at this place are quite steep, given the tiny size of the rooms. They have been smart in the layout to maximise space, but at the end of the day, when your friends come around to visit, then you will feel the cramp cosy size of the room. Given the place is designed to be more of a place to crash and dump and store your luggage, then this should be ok, but the pricing should reflect that too. The facilities are very bare bones here, but at least wifi is free and in all areas of the hotel and in the rooms. The housekeeping was a little slow as well here. I had stepped out for the day and came back to my room at 2:30pm to find everything was still as I had left it that morning. I was able to go down and request the room to be cleaned, as I had wanted to quickly rest before heading out again, and my room was ready to go by 3pm. A little disappointing that it took a request to have my room cleaned by mid afternoon. Finally, the walls are quite thin. I could hear the mumblings of a phone conversation next door and every bit of shuffling with drawers and footsteps. Not good for light sleepers.All in all, front desk staff are superb, a bit pricey for the room and basic facilities provided, but still enjoyed my time in Waikiki.","Sydney, Australia","TravellingCarlito</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",216,3.0

It felt like they really cared about your stay and weren't just running through the motions. As for location, the beach was just a pleasant walk away.

I actually had my hair and make-up done in this room. We were greeted at the front desk with smiles, ice cold pineapple juice, and refreshing cold towels. The front desk, concierge, and the valets were all super friendly and accommodating. We needed an iron for our room - brought up in seconds. We needed some forks and plates to eat our leftover wedding cake - they were brought right to us from the kitchen in the middle of the afternoon. The complementary breakfast included coffee, tea, juice, toast, FRESH tropical fruits and a variety of pastries (different every day - at least one including some kind of protein like sausage or chopped pork). The location was perfect - a couple blocks down a shaded street and there you are, right on Waikiki beach and close to all kinds of shopping. We would stay here again in a heart beat. A few things to know when booking: they offer rooms with two twin beds (apparently to serve Japanese vacationers) so be aware of your room description, the rooms are small for the average American couple but have everything you need, and the parking deck (valet only) has a one lane entrance and exit which could lead to some close calls getting out of the deck. Also, we were upgraded to a ""partial ocean view"" room. It was pretty much a tiny sliver of ocean between two buildings, so not much of a view at all.

The hotel is less than two blocks from the beach and the main tourist street. You can walk to everything in Waikiki or if you park a car at the hotel, it is $25 a day, but you can take the car in and out as many times as you want per day. Seems expensive, but after more research in Waikiki, it is actually a decent price. The hotel provides beach towels and beach chairs if you ask for them. Our favorite ""extra"" was the included breakfast. The fresh fruit and pastries each morning were wonderful and the coffee was tasty, not the crap a lot of hotels serve.If you have allergies you will be happy to see how they set out each item so they do not mix. For me this was key when avoiding some fruit. My only suggestion would be if you are diabetic the breakfast doesn't have any protein, so plan accordingly.

We stayed here at the beginning and the end of our holiday and neither time disappointed us. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Especially Jackie the concierge who assisted us to get married in Waikiki beach with only a few days notice. Had it not been for her our marriage would not have come off. We will be eternally grateful to her!!The hotel lobby is modern and welcoming with comfortable lounges and furniture. The continental breakfast is a great way to start the day. We had 2 rooms and both had everything one could need with a comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom. The location is ideal - a block back from the main road along the beach with good bus access just outside the door. This location is convenient to everything in Waikiki. If you are planning an active holiday where you only sleep in your hotel then this is ideal. We cannot recommend it highly enough. ,"Sydney, Australia","Peter R</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Sydney, Australia</strong>",22,5.0

Just a few days after I arrived, they knew me by my name and were always eager to assist with any of my needs.The hotel has a beautiful lobby and sitting area where I was able to meet with clients or enjoy a continental breakfast of fresh fruit, pastries, coffee or tea. The basic rooms were modern, very clean but depending on what you want, could be a little on the small side. However, I do know larger rooms and suites are available if your looking for more space.Another great feature about the Vive is they have a courtesy room that you can reserve if you have a late flight. On the last day, I was able to check out of my room, spend time enjoying the day at the beach and return to shower and change for a late night flight If you looking for a quiet, personal and well located hotel, I would recommend the Vive to anyone.","Naperville, Illinois","R F</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Naperville, Illinois</strong>",0,5.0

We typically rely on TripAdvisor for most of our trips, eating, and excursion choices where ever we vacation and have not been steered wrong until our experience at the Vive Waikiki.First, the hotel assured us of the prices while booking and claimed our deposit would be credited back upon check-out...yet after our week stay they claimed the deposit would Not be credited back as it is a hotel tax. Which is ridiculous because if they are advertising these ""discounted rates"" and assuring customers of them.....then there should be NO HIDDEN FEES upon check-out.Second, there is NO parking at this hotel. All of the street parking in the city of Waikiki is metered and with Waikiki being a very busy city with a blend of locals and tourists....finding parking on the street is extremely difficult. The Vive offers ""Valet Parking""...BUT THERE IS A $25 PER DAY FEE ...you also have to take into consideration the tips for the valet guys.Third, our room DID have a beautiful view of the ocean....but the room was very small, there were NO DRAWERS anywhere to store our clothes....just a few open shelves under the TV-Stand and a very small open closet that had no door or curtain for the privacy of your items. Due to this....my husband and I just decided to live out of our suitcases for the week.The bathroom was SO SMALL, I didn't even have room to store my blow-dryer, flat-iron, hair products, lotions....so they stayed in my suitcase as well and I took them out as needed. And EVERY SINGLE time I showered....The bathroom floor flooded. After a long day of driving to the north shore (WHICH IS AMAZING AND HAS GREAT BEACHES AND REALLLY GOOD SHRIMP TRUCKS) I showered....we went to bed...and around 11pm I had the maintenance guy knocking at the door to ask if ""water is running in the bathroom bc the people under us were complaining of a leak in their ceiling"" First of all...it was WAY TOO late to be knocking at the door, they could have at least called our room so we weren't so startled by the loud knocking. And second...I noticed this issue the first day we arrived when I showered and I notified the front desk who seemed to just disregard it. Anyways....I ended up using ALL of my bathroom mat towel, shower towels ,and hand towels each day to sop up the excess water. NOT FUN.The ""Mini"" Fridge did not keep out food cold.....We purchased deli meat and fruit so we could pack lunch for the beach and not have to rely on buying out for every meal...also saving us from waiting on lines for places to eat near the beach. We contacted the front desk and they sent a maintenance guy up...who told me ""this is not really a refrigerator...its more like a cooler for water...it doesn't really get cold enough for food storage.""Fourth, the daily cleaning service kept turning off our air conditioner. Coming from a long hot day at the beach to a HOT room is NOT what we wanted. We notified the front desk who assured they would take care of it....Yet it happened 5x days in a row...So someone is obviously NOT doing their job here. Another thing, each morning when we left the hotel for the day I made sure I placed ALL dirty towels, any sheets I wanted cleaned, food plates, glasses I wanted replaced....in a neat pile at the front door...So it was OBVIOUS that everything in the pile was to be taken out of the room. But they left our food plates and glasses 3x days in a row....Even after we called the front desk. I ended up taking my own plates and glasses down to the main lobby each morning and leaving them in the dirty dishes spot at the continental breakfast area.Last but not least....upon arrival our ""Key Card"" did not work, we called the front desk who sent up maintenance....whose key card did not work either. They said they had to replace the entire door lock. We figured it would take about 10minutes so we said sure. But it took 45minutes in which there were 2x maintenance men working on it. My husband and I planned each of our days with excursions and dinner reservations far in advance.....And this door malfunction greatly effected our first night in Waikiki. It prevented us from showering, or going anywhere, and resulted in us missing our reservation for dinner which we were not happy about...And the front desk seems to agree with everything and say they will fix it.....yet nothing ever changed. PLEASE don't be fooled by this hotel. My husband and I are super laid back....we barely spend any time in our room when we vacation...and we have NEVER EVER had to complain this much and are both really shocked that this was such a falsely advertised hotel. We usually just let things go....but this hotel was consistently inconveniencing us. And the hotel manager has no regard for customers.....bc after all the ""room problems"" we had, they never apologized nor did anything about it....AND still charged us for an extra night they claimed would be just a ""holding deposit""It would be nice if this hotel realized that customer service is KEY when running a business....And were true to their customers especially when it comes to FEES. I would really like my husband and I to be refunded or discounted for our inconveniences....I feel we truly deserve it.... We are very disappointed and will absolutely share our experience with EVERYONE we know.","Anchorage, Alaska","Carol-Anne8612</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Anchorage, Alaska</strong>",3,2.0

We stayed on the 19th floor and found our room to be clean and well suited. The size was similar to NYC hotels, which I knew in advance. The coffee and water during the day was a great touch! I couldn't find bottled water for a reasonable price so the amenities provided were great. Something that can be improved on is the clicking noise that the air conditioner makes. Also, the bathroom was tiny, but manageable. We rented a car during the last 3 days of our trip. We took the bus ($2.50/person) to the airport to pick up the car so we would avoid a transportation shuttle on the way back. In addition, we parked at Aston Waikiki Banyan which only costed $15 for a 24 hour period (unlimited in and out).

The lobby is quite lovely and modern....and then it started to go downhill from there. We were trying to check-in with the front desk and it ended up being a big hassle because of the Groupon. Although we had everything that was indicated on the Groupon itself, the individual at the front desk insisted that we needed an entirely different document. Eventually it was all sorted out, however it took almost 45 minutes to get checked in and, not to mention, the individual at the front desk that we were dealing with was quite unpleasant and a little snobby (and please note that once we went to the room, we double checked - and confirmed - that we had all of the proper documentation as stipulated on the Groupon.) Anyway, it was our anniversary, so we weren't going to let that ruin it - and perhaps the individual at the front desk was just having a bad day. We finally made it to the room ....and wow.... well, it was very clean and fresh, but it was literally the size of a dorm room!! We have been in many boutique style rooms in this world, but I'm fairly certain that this was the smallest one. It was so small that if you were to get up from the bed to go to the washroom, you would crack your knee on the door frame (which both my husband and I did.) Now, I don't mean to be overly negative, so here are some great positives; the location is great (you're just a short walk to the beach and the Waikiki ""strip""), because it is a brand new hotel, it is very clean and the beds are very comfortable.All in all, we probably wouldn't go back to Vive for another anniversary or staycation, but if you are able to get a good deal and you're not bothered by a small room, then you might want to give it a try.","Kapolei, Hawaii","Happy_Travellers041</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Kapolei, Hawaii</strong>",55,3.0

When I was planning our itinerary, I came across Vive Hotel on a popular Vacation package site. I came here for reviews and thought this would be a nice hotel to stay at. We booked a 5 night stay and could not be any happier with our choice. We booked a standard room with ocean view. The view was not spectacular, but we could see the ocean from the 18th floor. Our room was very small compared to big chain hotels, but felt cozy and clean. The toilet gave this foul smell every time we flushed, but I noticed the same smell at other establishments during our trip around Oahu. The customer service was superb. My cousin called Vive Hotel a week before our trip and spoke to Jacqueline to set up an anniversary surprise for us. The staff made sure the surprise was set up as described when we checked in. I took a picture of the boxes of choc dipped strawberries and candies on the bed and my cousin gave it a thumbs up. Another staff that stood out was Robb. My wife and I went out to dinner and had some left overs. We figured we can save some money by boxing it up and eating it for lunch the next day. We went down to the lobby and asked Robb if they have a microwave we can use. He stated that it was staff use only, but was willing to heat up our food for us. He walked us towards the back where they set up their continental breakfast. He came out with 2 plates and utensils and asked if we wanted to just put our food on a plate since microwaving a to-go Styrofoam tray was not ideal. I offered him food, but he respectively said no thank you. He stayed for a while and we talked about things to do nearby and places to eat. Valet is $25/night and we used this service 4 out of the 5 nights we stayed. I did not get his name, but one guy seemed like he was somewhat waiting for a tip when we dropped off our car. He had a tribal tattoo sleeve. It was unfortunately that he was only there when we dropped our car off. We always tipped every time we picked up our car. If you don't mind staying near a busy Waikiki, this is the place to stay. Clean, cozy rooms. Two blocks from Waikiki beach. Great service.

Staff is friendly, accommodating and helpful. On our return trip they found us a room hours before we expected to move in. Good coffee and fresh fruit and pastries in the morning, in a very comfortable lounge area off the lobby.

Chic and modern style, friendly & helpful staff, compact yet clean & stylish room, yummy pastries & fruits for breakfast, close to many spots in Waikiki.The only downside we experienced was with the shuttle bus service that was recommended by the hotel (Hawaii Super Transit). We waited over an hour for the pickup at the airport, and an additional 30 min for the pickup at the hotel. Yes it is the more economical choice, but if you ever consider using their service, be ready to waste your vacation time waiting. It was quite upsetting to find out that the hotel refers a service to their guests that doesn't meet up to their standards. I would kindly recommend the hotel to reconsider this referral.That being said, we would definitely return to this hotel for our next trip, we'll probably just grab a cab next time!","Montreal, Canada","A M</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Montreal, Canada</strong>",0,4.0

There is also a Farmers Market a few days a week, just a couple, of blocks away. The hotel staff were exceptionally attentive, pleasant and very helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable. We made use of the beach towels and mats but they also offer beach chairs and other beach gear. Breakfast was included and when we went on a tour that left before breakfast started, the staff packed some fruit and pastries for us to take on the bus. A courtesy room was offered for us to freshen up after checking out since our flight left at 8:00 p.m. The hotel manager was very kind and prompt to act when there was a bit of miscommunication.

We were accommodated with a Lifestyle Jr. suite and welcomed with a box of chocolate and a note to congratulate us on our anniversary. What a lovely surprise. We had a small but lovely view of the water. The room was large and nicely airconditioned with two A/C units. The fridge was great as we were able to buy some drinks for our excursions. The shower was HUGE and at first I was worried about the Rain showerhead because water pressure is a big deal for me as I have waist length hair; however, it was fantastic. The king bed and pillows were nice and comfy.My only complaint is that I could hear so much noise outside during the night. Seems like all trucks have beeping sounds when backing up and there were lots of police sirens. I woke up every morning at about 5am due to these two noises. However, this is easily overlooked by everything else that was great.I thought that the continental breakfast was actually quite nice. Pineapple juice instead of Orange but that was a nice surprise. Fruit and some tasty (sweet) pastries, coffee and tea. There was a toaster oven so you can heat up your pastries (which made them taste better). Location was fabulous. Only a few blocks from the Waikiki beach and shopping. While there was no pool they provided us with free towels, boogieboards and beach chairs.

When it rained the water would hit the back of the air conditioning machine causing the thunking sounds to travel into the room. The A/C operates intermittently rather so you can compressor go throughout the night. It was nice since it would drown out the sounds from the street. Overall, our stay at the VIVE Hotel was excellent. Would definitely recommend others to stay.","Nanaimo, Canada","Tomi H</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Nanaimo, Canada</strong>",3,5.0

We were upgraded to the King bedroom suite which was very spacious and very clean. The hotel offers a continental breakfast every morning which consists of pastries, fruit, pineapple juice, coffee and tea (make sure you use the toaster oven for the pastries, it’s a must). We learned this the second day. The hotel also offers free wifi (which you don’t get free at any hotel unless you pay a daily resort fee of $30.00) and they provide you with complimentary beach towels, mats, and even chairs for the beach, which you would typically have to buy elsewhere. The hotel also provides their guests with a complimentary room for one hour on the date you check out in case you want to go to the beach and need a clean room to shower in before your flight. Like which hotel offers that for free???? Although we didn’t take advantage of this the option was definitely appreciated. Furthermore, the hotel is located only minutes from the beach so it was only a short walk each morning. The staff was incredible as well! Kevin was awesome in letting us know about the cool hot spots in Waikiki and basically helped us with anything we needed. He was amazing! My partner also proposed while we were there and George was fabulous in making arrangements to ensure our room was decorated with beautiful flowers upon our return. It was stunning! Overall, we had an amazing stay at the Vive Hotel and when we return for our wedding we will definitely be referring our guests here!","Vancouver, Canada","SK3636</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong>",0,5.0

It is a short walk from the beach where the iconic Duke Kahanamoku statue is located.This is a European boutique style hotel. There are leather couches in the lobby, continental breakfast is served, and there is no pool. Although there is no restaurant or bar, you don't have to wait 15 minutes for a crowded elevator like the resort hotels either.The service was excellent. Robb at the front desk is da kine!!! He's super friendly, helpful, and gave good recs on dinner and nightlife. The remainder of the staff was also friendly and gave an Aloha spirit.Unfortunately, IMHO there are many downsides to the rooms. They are tiny for $179/night (Expedia): Two people would feel very cramped in the room. You basically walk into the room and nearly trip on the bed. In addition, there is no real closet, the air conditioner sticks out the window, and the bathroom is narrow. Additionally, one of my pillows really smelled, as though the pillow case was not changed. It also smelled on the second night. Lastly, there is no ocean view.I would not stay here again.

I booked through Hotwire, so I didn’t know I was going to get this hotel but I’m really glad I did. My first impression was a great one with the front desk staff. Friendly and efficient. The room is small, and the bathrooms are very small. However, my personal “thing” with hotels is cleanliness. I don’t care if the room is big or small, it’s got to be clean. (I worked in the hotel business for 17 years, so I’m a little picky). Vive exceeded all of my expectations. There was nothing wrong with the rooms and their cleanliness. I was very impressed, and thoroughly enjoyed my stay because of the care with the room.Vive is a select service property (No restaurant, no bar, etc). What they do offer, they do well. The continental breakfast in the morning is simple but nice. A couple types of fresh sliced fruit, a couple types of fresh pastries, coffee, tea, and juice.

The free breakfast is basic, but does what it needs to do (rolls/coffee/fruit/juices). My room was small, but nicely equipped/comfortable. I was by myself, so I did the smallest room they offered, for reference. The absolute best part of this hotel is the fact that they well let you come back later in the day after you've already checked out and park for free and use a room for free to change/shower/get arranged before you head to the airport for an overnight flight back to the mainland. This was a life savor as I was able to fully enjoy the island (swimming/getting full of sand) and then change back to my Minnesota winter-wear before heading back to the frozen tundra.

I can not express how grateful we were for that, thank you Beverley! For the first night we stayed in a cosmopolitan room which is a good size for singles and couples.

The décor was beautiful, modern, clean and new, really lovely.The location of the hotel is perfect, not even a 2 minute walk to the beach, main strip and endless ABC stores!

Kevin couldn't do enough for you, you'd ask for something and in a blink of an eye Kevin had it already organised. Beverley did so much to make our stay comfortable and was extremely informative and helpful. Michael assisted us greatly with a special request that we had. The ladies that organised breakfast every morning were so beautiful and friendly, even re-ordering my favourite muffins when they had finished so I could enjoy them the next morning!

One of the best hotels I have ever stayed in for sheer helpfulness (and I've travelled worldwide and stay in a hotel on average once a week). The concierge, Jackie, absolutely stood out for me, as she was unbelievably helpful before I'd even arrived. I had a lot to plan and I'd been emailing her weeks before I'd arrived (my parents were joining me over Christmas for their 40th wedding anniversary), nothing was a problem. She continued to help me throughout my trip recommending great places to eat and drink, as a single girl, as well as fab activities I could take part in. I left feeling like I was leaving a friend behind! The rest of the staff including George (concierge) and Kevin and Beverley (reception) were supremely helpful and friendly too - day and night (the reception is manned 24 hours). I simply can't fault them. The hotel is literally two blocks from the beach and the main streets with all the shops, restaurants, bars, other hotels. I felt very safe walking around at night from the hotel to these locations. Nothing was more than about a 10 minute walk away along very busy streets. The breakfast was simple - fruit and pastries, with a selection of teas and coffee, but that was perfect for me as I'm not a big breakfast eater and was off to learn to surf. Throughout the day and night there was always complimentary teas and coffees. The breakfast area is really cute with a range of breakfast bar, comfy chairs, benches and tables and chairs. The rooms are immaculate, comfy and minimalist in a modern, cool way, with neutral decor. I felt very at home! I would have no hesitation recommending this hotel.

Chose the Vive since it is so new.....and my instinct was absolutely spot-on. This is a great place to stay with reasonable price points for what you are getting. I have zero concerns or complaints. Clean, neat, customer-oriented from the second you walk through the doors. While not overplush....it is very well decorated and all furnishings are chic and fabulous. I travel all around the world and stay at some very nice resorts/hotels....and I can say that this Vive ranks well with anyone. It is what it is.....simply eclectic and remarkable. The lobby area is a great place to relax and chill....great taste in the style. All employees were very engaging with their conversation but not pushy or patronizing. They genuinely care for you and your needs. Kuhio Avenue can be a dog and pony show with all kinds of activities trying to get your attention....but this is truly an oasis in the middle of all the entertainment. The street noise was no big deal in my estimation....especially with the AC turned on. Very comfortable room indeed. Bed was awesome....and good for everything you need or desire! ;-) If you want to avoid the parking costs and don't mind walking....just park up on Monsorrat Avenue across from the Shell at Kapiolani Park. Free on-street parking on the left hand side of the road....safe in my opinion. Only about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel....and will save you $$ if you have to pay either at the Vive or any other local structure. As well, up the street at the Waikiki Banyan parking is $15.00 per 24 hours....only a couple blocks east up on Kuhio Avenue. Parking at the Vive will run you $25.00 per day....which is about what you will pay most places if not more. Save the $$ and just walk a few minutes to Monsorrat Avenue. If you are looking for a fantastic experience.....you cannot go wrong with these folks. Continental breakfast was good....but some people may want something more substantial. Plenty of options from which to choose all around the property....but that always comes with a price, right? So enjoy all the comforts of the Vive.....just do it!","Honolulu, Hawaii","Williambtwo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Honolulu, Hawaii</strong>",0,5.0

The rooms are clean, the staff is super helpful, and the location really isn't too bad...just one block from the beach. The only negatives are the parking prices ($25/day) and the size of the rooms. I have never stayed in a smaller room in my career (and I've stayed at dozens of hotels in NYC), but it really didn't bother me, because I wasn't spending much time in my room.

We chose the Junior Suite from a previous review on TripAdvisor, and we were thrilled. We booked through the hotel directly, as they had a better rate than the one on Expedia. From the moment we arrived, the friendly staffed were ever so helpful with assisting us in whatever we needed, and although it was early in the morning, they had organized a room to be ready for us ahead of check-in time. We were in room 1808 (I think) and we had a corner room on the building, with Diamond Head on the left and facing straight down to Waikiki Beach. The room was impeccable, clean and brand new inside. The huge king bed is so comfortable, and the bathroom is amazing!! So much bench space for all of our toiletries and a HUGE walk in shower. I've never seen anything so mind-blowing in all my life - showering at home is just not the same!! The room includes free WiFi which was super-fast and great, and breakfast downstairs was good. You get a choice of fruits and pastries/croissants. If I could add anything, some hard-boiled eggs and maybe toast would be a great addition however there are so many places to go out for breakfast so this really wasn't a big deal at all. The hotel is literally a 2 min walk to pretty much everything, with bus stops and trolley stops all around, and a quick stroll down the road will take you straight to Waikiki Beach where the Duke statue is. Fantastic!! This was our second trip to Hawaii and I would highly recommend this hotel - in fact I already have told everyone I know about it. If you are wanting a view, do yourself a favour a pay the extra money for the Junior Suites. You may not be right on Waikiki Beach, but you can see it from the window and that was sure as hell good enough for me! I thoroughly enjoyed standing at the bathroom sink every morning, brushing my teeth and having a view of the ocean and horizon in the mirror's reflection!! Also the hotel has no pool or restaurant on site but seriously who cares?! For the price we paid, which was much less than any oceanfront hotel in Honolulu, this is without a doubt the best value for the location, convenience, service and cleanliness.

This is a new boutique hotel that has been completely renovated and refurbished. Vive has an urban chic decor/feel and I loved it. Don't get me wrong, I love the whole Hawaii-ana and tropical feel of Waikiki, but you get that every where you go. At the end of the day I liked coming back to my room at Vive and walking into that feeling of casual sophistication. I had a junior suite and highly recommend this category. It is a bigger room and my room, on the 21st floor, had amazing views. The rooms do not have lanais but when I'm in Hawaii, I want to be on the beach when I'm not in meetings. I loved that the Vive is only a short 2 block walk to Waikiki beach. Because it's not beachfront it has a great price point. It's a smaller property so it definitely feels less crowded and more intimate. AND the best part, a simple continental breakfast is included, there is no resort fee and there is free WIFI. No hidden costs to add to your bill. I honestly don't think you can get that at any other hotel in Waikiki.

Somemore, hotel guests can borrow their beach chairs and towels for free. Just remember to return when you are back! Some suggestions: 1) can have floats for guests too as I realise some hotels do provide that too.2) Beside cold breakfast, some toasts or cereals can be added to the spread. Eating 9 days of cold bread really scare me off.3) an option for King sized bed.",Singapore,"celyeo</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore</strong>",1,4.0

It's very clean and comfortable. Located two blocks from the beach. Only complaint I have is that if you're a light sleeper it's noisy. There's a lot of traffic going by the hotel as Kuhio Ave is a major thoroughfare with buses going by every 5-10minutes. But that's beyond the control of the hotel the other noise that kept me up all night on the first night was the air conditioning which makes a loud humming noise.

(Talk about perfect timing) What got me was ""new hotel"". Well turns out it's just a new name for a building thats been recently renovated. It's located right next to Hy's, a fine dining steakhouse. Across the street there was some kinda little bbq restaurant with outside seating. Didn't bother going there. When you drive into the hotel, valet is on the second floor. Front desk is in the lobby. The room I had was really small. There was a little closet to my right as i entered the carded entry to my room. It contained a luggage rack, hangers, iron, mini digital safe, and ironing board. The mini fridge could barely fit my four water bottles and perrier, but I did get a slightly larger than reg sized bottle for all of them. None could fit on the door and I couldn't understand why it had a bar going across to brace...? It has a flat screen tv (40""?), WIFI, 2 chairs, queen bed and a nightstand on each side with 2 lamps. The ac was a 7800 btu, but it did the job for the small room. They also had blackout curtains. I didn't know where to put my boxers and stuff, but later realized there were drawers under the foot of the bed... duh! The bathroom had a sliding door with no lock. It doesn't have much storage space for the ladies that carry tons of makeup and whatever else they use so if you are looking for counter space, forget it. Even the sink has about a 2 1/2"" rim, but what blew me was the depth of the sink. It was only 2"" deep! Man, I had to watch where my boogers flew because they would bounce right back up! Lol... I used to watch my aunts fill the sink with water to wash their faces so I felt I had to mention that as well. There's a tiny black bag on the bottom of the sink with a blow dryer inside. It has a full size tub and the water runs well with plenty of hot water. They supply shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, and bar soap. They serve free breakfast from 7am to 930am? Coffee, decaf, water, pineapple juice, tea bags, muffins, pastry, crossaint, strawberry and grape jelly, melon, pineapple, and cantelop. To the left as you exit the hotel, there's mac 24/7 that's open 24hrs serving a wide variety with local foods. It's a couple minutes walk on the same side. To the right there's Chili's about a 5 minute walk and a few other restaurants around there. Fattys is a great ""hole in the wall"" place for chinese. No dim sum though. It only has about 10 counter seating so just wait on the chairs outside or make takeout at the other door. Hula dog serves interesting puka (""hole"" in Hawaiian) hot dogs with Hawaiian relishes. If you like udon then marukame udon makes their udon and everything that goes in it from scratch. Expect to stand in a long line! Dukes is nearby which is an open restaurant on the beach. Good place to chill and watch the sunset with some good food. There are several open markets around and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping Center which is the biggest shopping center in waikiki. Great restaurants and name brand department stores. Man, so many things to explain that I need to end it right here. To sum it up, bad for barbie doll and good for ken.

They lost power twice while I was there (though it was quickly restored). ""Ocean view"" blocked by UGLY concrete buildings reminiscent of 1950s soviet-bloc construction.

Which was true, but it's worth noting that all the reviews are correct: the rooms are indeed tiny. There are also two ""extra tiny"" rooms on each floor, and we got one of these, on one of the lowest floors (I suspect because we booked on Living Social - many hotels seem to want to punish you for circumventing the system in order to get a cheaper deal!). The room was barely larger than the queen bed within it, and had almost no flat surfaces to put things down on. Because we had no room to unpack anything, all our stuff remained jumbled and disorganized in and on our bags for the duration of our stay. The bathroom was nice, and modern, but also tiny, and with no counter space at all. The elevators were small and slow, and inevitably by the time it finally reached the lobby, there'd be twelve other people waiting there with you, and you'd all cram on it together.All that being said, the staff were friendly for the most part, the complimentary continental breakfast (coffee, pineapple juice, croissants, danishes, muffins, fresh pineapple, honeydew melon and cantaloupe) was tasty and convenient, and the lobby and breakfast/lounge area was clean, modern and stylish. Most notably, the hotel is located just two blocks north of Waikiki Beach (the Duke statue, to be specific) and this goes a little way toward balancing out some of the negatives mentioned above. In summary, the VIVE Waikiki is trying hard to be an upscale hotel, but even with the great location and modern look, the rooms are just too tiny to justify the regular price being charged.

My stay was pleasant up until I was trapped in their elevator for 1 hour. I am a pretty grounded person so I remained calm and did what I was suppose to do (luckily I had my cell phone with me, and it was 1 other person in the elevator). I didn't become bothered until 15 minutes into being stuck, I finally was able to reach front desk staff by phone. Well, they were very nonchalant about the entire thing! After 30 minutes of no check in or reassurance from them, myself and the other guy decided to call 911. We'd had enough. Once the ambulance gets there, we were out in no time. We had been in there 1 hour total.We realize that this can happen anywhere (things happen), but it was the nonchalant, uninterested, lazy apology that bothered. After all, I was stuck for an hour on Sunday morning. This caused a huge inconvenience as my husband and I were late to worship, not to mention it was terrifying and unsettling! I was sort of scared to get back on the elevators after, but my room was on the 18th floor.Apparently being trapped in their elevators were ""no big deal"" because the staff never approached us after the incident, management did not personally apologize and you'd think they'd have the decency to check on me and the other guy. The apology was a sorry note and a bag of ""Honolulu cookies"" on my bed after my return back that evening. I can't say that I appreciated the gesture because it was very impersonal and little effort. It would have been nice to receive a REAL apology, a reassurance that issues as such do not normally happen at their establishment and the proper way to apologize would have been to offer something a bit more extravagant than cookies! A complimentary night stay, a discounted stay, dinner on Vive, a free excursion, massage gift cert.Am I being ridiculous? I just didn't FEEL the apology. Unfortunately because of this incident, I will not be staying again nor recommending Vive as a hotel.","Milpitas, California","SadeJL</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Milpitas, California</strong>",26,2.0

My wife is always worried when going to a new place because you never know what you'll end up with. Vive was everything you want in a hotel. The rooms are small, but clean and modern. A/C kept the room comfortable the entire time.Clean - Vive was very clean, from the rooms to the lobby, even the elevators. The cleanliness was a remarkable feat because sand is everywhere. Especially because of people like us that are constantly on the go. Location - The hotel is 2 blocks from the Duke statue, which is a meeting place for many activities and a major entrance to Waikiki Beach. Me BBQ across the street is Korean bbq to die for.Staff - The staff was always smiling and happy to help. Especially Kevin at the front desk. This guy was our go-to for everything from tours, activities, food, nightlife and maximizing our fun in the sun. If there was an award for greatest front desk guy ever, it would be Kevin. Also housekeeping deserves a round of applause because the sand is cleaned up as soon as it's tracked in.

I enjoyed their positivity and smiles as i passed through the lobby throughout my 8 day stay.Hotel rooms in Waikiki are notorious for being on the small side, Vive is no exception! However, unlike the rest of the hotels, Vive offers newly renovated and refurbished rooms. The bed was very comfortable and the outside noise was minimal. Vive also offered complimentary WiFi (quite fast), use of beach gear (good condition), and breakfast (fresh fruit and juice was great).If you are looking for holiday where you want to lay next to the pool and relax in bed I wouldn't recommend Vive.

I had heard that this new hotel was opening up, so I took a chance on it. I'm glad I did. First of all, the price was right. Hopefully they will keep the prices at a reasonable level as they start to build a following! When I priced it in July 2013, they were by far the best value for price-location-room. It's really a beautiful hotel. Lots of vibrant colors, but nothing too flashy or cheesy, like some of the ""aloha hotels"" can be. It's not a big resort hotel, but a smaller independent hotel. They have a nice continental breakfast with Hawaiian coffee, juice, rolls and fruit. It was all fresh...not packaged cheap food like some big chains offer up. I ate it every morning I was there - saving time and money. Wi-Fi is free and it was pretty swift. The beach is a straight shot...just two short blocks away from the hotel. The hotel is on Kuhio, the second most street running through Waikiki. It's not on the street that runs right along the beach (Kalakua?), which can be kind of loud, even at night. Kuhio seems to have more restaurants...and affordable ones...than are on Kalakua Street. Bottom line...I will go back there when I revisit Oahu. I'll ask them what ""Vive"" means next time.
