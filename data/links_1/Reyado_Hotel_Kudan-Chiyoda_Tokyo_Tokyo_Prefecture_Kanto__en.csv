It very quickly became my home away from home. A lovely small hotel with a central location but also relatively quiet at night. The hotel was very clean with an extremely comfortable bed and great shower. Staff were helpful and friendly and English is spoken. There is is a wonderful cafe just across the street where I got breakfast most mornings. There is also a restaurant just above the hotel where i had dinner the last night and wished I had known about it sooner as it was very good. I would not hesitate to go back here again and I think the pricing was reasonable for a Tokyo hotel.,,tmarshbrit,0,5.0
