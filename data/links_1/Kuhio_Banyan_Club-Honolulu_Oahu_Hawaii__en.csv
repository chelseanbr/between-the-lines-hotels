The good: great location, Murphy bed was surprisingly comfortable, good to have fridge and dishes. The rest: the room is small, old, and although clean in appearance we didn't trust it and covered the furniture and wore socks/shoes in the unit. Not the kind of resort where you will be able to enjoy time in your room. Up in the morning and back at night. They misrepresent the ""resort fee"" of $200 as a state tax but it is not that and you cannot opt out of paying for it. This allows you to ""borrow"" a barbie size blow drier and a remote for your TV. They offered local parking for a very cheap rate for the week and we recouped the $200 by attending a vacation club presentation. Nothing was a surprise to us and knew what we were getting when we accepted this trade. Best we could get in the location in the heart of Waikiki.

If you are looking for a basic efficiency room with the basics this is your spot. The location is very good. Close to bus stop and international market place as well as Dukes alley and Waikiki beach. The room had a nice kitchen area. The bed was better than I expected as it was a fold down Murphy bed. The check in process was tedious but once you get past that the cost and location are the best. There is an elevator which was nice with lots of luggage. Be aware that there is a resort fee and they place a 250 deposit for security. If you need luxury don’t expect it here.

Got this through Travelocity for a very good price. Got a room with a very moldy air conditioner but that was fixed immediately when we were upgraded to a double room suite. Staff here is great...they will do everything to help. Location is perfect...immediately across the street from the international market and 5 minute walk to beach at Royal Hawaiian Hotel. We got the kitchenette and it was stocked with everything needed to cook. The rooms are fairly old but well maintained. The only downside I see is that there is a night club on the first floor and it gets fairly loud but I think it depends where your room is and what time you are returning.

Stay away!! Even worse, management is rude, terrible and will not refund you for used OR unused nights, even if you bring live bugs to the front desk and show that you were bitten. Talk about a health hazard. The clerk actually tried to insinuate we brought them in, which is so wrong. We’re fastidious people who react badly to the bites, so I can 1000% guarantee we did not bring those bugs in. We never have ANY pest control problems at home.Their only solution was to switch our room, which we declined because bed bugs can travel between walls. How could they guarantee another room was bug free? 1/3 of people don’t react to the bites, so no complaints don’t mean no bugs. And how many guests were unaware and mistook the bites for something else? After how we were treated, the trust was gone.We made the mistake of choosing this hotel instead of a national chain because we wanted a kitchenette and to support a local business. Never again. The rest of our group went to national chains with zero problems.Things other reviewers complained about that we were willing to overlook:1. The nightclub downstairs that pumps the bass with clubgoers screaming from 1-3:30am. We were far enough away, it was just tolerable. But I can’t imagine being in the rooms right above the club.2. Noisy downtown location in front of a busy bus stop (constant traffic)3. Dated decor and run down, slummy apartments right next door4. Can’t open windows & the window AC can just barely keep up with the heat5. Bathroom jalousie windows are stuck open with no other ventilation so the bathroom stays humid and smelly6. Hot water takes forever to come on7. Front desk closes at 10pm so if you need anything you’re SOL until the morning or $45 new key charge. Don’t get locked out!8. No free parking included or anywhere nearbyWe were ok dealing with all of that, but BED BUGS are a dealbreaker! To ensure we didn’t bring them home (they can be a nightmare to get rid of), we had to throw away our luggage and ziplock all our belongings at the airport, then wash & dry everything at the laundromat before taking it home. At least we saw them. Can’t imagine all the people staying here who may be taking bed bugs home unaware.",,KinaHinFL,1,1.0

Therefore, the price paid is a pretty decent value. The property itself is dated and basic, but perfectly fine if you don't plan to spend a lot of time in your room (and in Hawaii, why would you?). There are Murphy beds, freshly vacuumed carpets, full kitchenettes, and comfy couches-- all you could want for a stay where you don't need luxury, but just a place to sleep. Staff are acceptably friendly.However, there are two caveats-- 1.) the Front Desk is not 24/7, so if you lose your key or arrive after 10:00 pm, you are out of luck! They will charge you a fee for letting you into your room. 2.) They charge you a resort fee. It isn't much compared to other hotels in the area, but since this is not even close to a resort-- for instance, there is no pool or hot tub-- I am not sure what these charges are supposed to be for.

Another plus would be the location since it's just how many minutes walk to the beach, and everything else is accessible or walkable from their point.I did not like the AC, the size (and obviously horsepower) was not suitable for the spaciousness of the room.

The Kuhio Banyan features a kitchen and every utensil needed, a good bathroom, safe, flat screen TV and - our first experience with a Murphy bed which pulls down from a closet. This hideaway bed was very comfortable and during the day enabled guests to have a much bigger living area.

I have travelled often to Waikiki from the mainland over the last 40 plus years and noticed prices have gone up consistently even for bare bones locations. The hotel lobby is not open 24 hours but your key will get you in the entrance next to the lobby to a small elevator and stairway. Just check on operating hours if you plan to arrive late. The folks working there seemed friendly. There are many eateries nearby which is convenient. The room I had, was a very dated kitchenette with a fold down murphy bed which was not counter balanced. If you cant lift (lower) much then be very careful. The doors covering the bed were looking like they might come off the hinges. The shower floor had been repainted but was peeling pretty well. There is little ventilation other than some old style slotted vented window above the shower which does not operate. The A.C. was a bit noisy. The safe did not work. The kitchen is functional and equipped. The TV is not a flat screen but the old glass tube type. The stereo has a cassette player. The pillows were very lumpy. The walls are thin so if your neighbors are fighting it can get interesting. (It was) The worst part of my stay was the carpet was not clean, bring flip flops or better, it was dirty to the point I would not walk barefooted. There was a huge brown carpet stain next to the bed. Here comes the really bad part. I got home today and was called about the stain in the carpet. I explained that it was there when I got the room. You could tell it was an old stain and I figured it was the price of staying in a low rent room. It was explained to me that the stain was not previously reported by housekeeping and therefore it was my liability. I again repeated the stain was already there. I was then asked what caused the stain. I could not believe this and then was told my $250 security deposit would be held and kept. Now I need to find an expert to prove this stain was already there which is going to be difficult. I was looking to see on previous posts if this a scam but at this point am asking for a back up from any one who has stayed in room 406 or any cleaner who has seen this stain before.

Nothing beat the location. It is just less than a minute walk to the bus stops and the shops and the restaurants. It is a good 5 minute walk to Waikiki Beach. NO WAY you can make it in two minutes to the beach. 2. The price is moderate even if you add up the resort fee. Comparing to other hotels around I was able to save some dollars.3. The hotel staff were okay..KIRIN was friendly..(not sure if i spelled his name correctly).4. Bed is comfortable. Room was clean with a kitchenette complete with utensils. Shower has good water pressure.5. It is quiet .. I slept well. Not Good;1. Check-out time is 10 am. Requested for an extension for one hour and woman at counter said NO . I stayed there for seven nights and I checked-in like 6:00 pm the first day and this woman didn't even allow me to extend the check out time for an hour.Not sure if you can call this a positive customer service. 2. There is a small lizard in the bathroom. It always appear every time i use the bathroom. See attached pictures.3. TV is placed beside the headboard ..no way you can watch tv while laying on the bed. See attached pictures again. First time in my travelling life that i've stayed in a hotel where a tv is positioned this way. 4. Room has no view front or back. See attached pictures.5. After 10 pm and you misplaced your keys, they will charge you an additional $45 to access your room.6. And lastly, that particular week they were installing boxes for the tv. and it really was a disturbance because the maintenance guy was a bit pushy in letting the technicians install the boxes inside our room.My Verdict: You can stay or not stay in this hotel. Nothing fancy , my room is simple and clean. The price 'though maybe cheaper has many side fees . Just keep this into consideration. Leaving your room untidy when you check out will get you a hefty fine. Even if you left the beach towel in the beach or you accidentally packed the tv remote in your luggage, all of this will garner you additional fees. This is my honest review or experience of this hotel when i stayed here. I stayed there from Feb 17th to the 24th. And my room was at the fourth floor.

Rooms are essentially studio apartments with Murphy bed( decent foam-mattress- slept VERY well!). Microwave, fridge, dishes, coffee pot, tv. No little shampoo bottles- but body wash dispenser is in the shower and hand soap dispenser on the counter. Furniture looks straight out of the 1950's- 60's...but WHO CARES??? Staff was SUPER friendly and pointed us to the great, inexpensive, local food close at hand. Noodle shop right in front, a $4.95 breakfast just a few minutes walk, and a Korean BBQ inside the nearby grocery. $15 resort fee gets you free use of nice BIG beach towels (like real beach towels, not little bath ones), beach chairs with carry strap, beach umbrella, floaties, boogie boards, etc. We stayed a ""THE"" local resort and had to pay extra to use beach chairs even with a $30/ day resort fee!. You will see other reviews that diss the decor... I call it Hawaii kitsch.It was clean, that is all I care about! Who cares if the elevator is small? Really?

We needed a room for half of the day until our late evening flight, so I booked the Kuhio Banyan Club the day before. Our room was ready even though we arrived a little before standard check-in time of 4pm. The third floor room facing Kuhio was larger than I expected, and was very quiet even though there are stores and restaurants on the first floor, and a busy bus stop in front of the hotel. Kitchenette was convenient and bathroom had only a shower, no tub. Furnishings were older, but clean overall. Wifi worked great in the room. The front desk does close at 10pm (there is a number to call in case of emergencies). The main door gets locked after 10pm, so all guests do get keys to the front door. I also saw a security guard walking around, so safety was never a concern. There is an elevator in the lobby.If you are on a budget or just need a place to get some rest, this is a great place to stay. Staff is very nice and they do have bag storage.

The elevator is more like a narrow closet, so you either have to make several trips to get your luggage upstairs, or shove everything in there as best you can. The room itself made us feel like we took a step back a few decades in time. There are mirrors EVERYWHERE. One wall was covered completely with mirror, and then a lattice covered that mirror entirely. The bed is in the living area with the couches, and it was a Murphy bed. It came out of wooden doors with again, mirrors on the outside. Not very comfortable, and the pillows were awful. Sleeping on the couch was more comfy, but I wish the couches had been sofa beds themselves. The bathroom was literally nothing but mirrors. You can see yourself everywhere except for in the shower itself. But as soon as you step out of the shower, there's your reflection on the wall. Same thing when you're sitting on the toilet... You're facing yourself. Also, the shower is raised about a foot and a half off the floor, so it's sort of steep when you're stepping out of it. The whole hotel just seemed to have an outdated and murky feel to it. And I know it's out of their control if it's not on their property, but the alleyway behind the hotel is full of trash and smells very, very strongly of urine. It was offsetting whenever you'd be walking to and from your room. So with all of that being said, the front desk staff is what made our stay there enjoyable. Jesse was particularly helpful as he was able to suggest different places to go, such as restaurants and different sections of the beaches that wouldn't be as packed as the rest of Waikiki. He also helped us find cheaper food on some menus of nearby restaurants. So thank you, Jesse.

However if you are looking for affordability, adequate accommodations and a convenient location than I definitely suggest looking in to the Kuhio Banyan Club. Below I have listed some helpful info and things that we came to find true at the KBC. We stayed in room 319- check in is at 4pm. We arrived early at about 11:00am and they had no rooms available yet however they did let us leave our bags and change so we could wander around Waikiki comfortably. Our room ended up being ready around 2:30pm-there is a $250 security deposit hold that they place on a credit card for incidentals but is released back to you after you check out and they have confirmed there is no damage to the room. - they also charge a $15 resort fee. This fee is non-negotiable. With this fee they have many things you can use such as beach towels, chairs, beach mats, umbrellas and more - the hotel has a washer and dryer you can use for $1.25 each-there is no parking here. They do however suggest places to park that are very nearby. - the rooms are dated and the photos on TripAdvisor are truly what you get. If this vibe is not for you then I do not recommend this hotel. - the kitchenette has a stove top, microwave, refrigerator and many dishes and utensils. It has NO stove. We used it a couple of times a day to save money- there is a grocery store located a block or so away which we found convenient. However if you travel further away from Waikiki you can get slightly better prices on most things -the Murphy bed is pretty firm but my husband and I enjoyed them for the most part. Sheets were clean and fresh. -there is a club practically right underneath the hotel. We found that especially over the weekend you could hear music from about 10pm-4am. It was not unbearable however. It was just a muffled sound. Some ear plugs would probably do the trick for any light sleepers. -bathroom was again dated but was exactly what I expected from pictures. Water pressure was amazing and the water got hot very quickly. - we only asked for housekeeping one day and all they did was take trash out and leave a roll of toilet paper. It would have been nice to come back to a freshly made bed but that didn't happen. - ice cream shop, subway,udon noodle place and many other small establishments are right downstairs. The new international marketplace is literally right across the street. - staff was pleasant. Never rude or hurried with us. - office is only open from 7:00am-10:00pm. If you check in late there is a $45 fee as someone must come from their home to check you in. They give you a key to come in as you would please late at night though. They do a good job on making people aware of this rule. - we had to leave the hotel at 4:00am for our flight we just let them know and they let us leave all of our keys and things in the hotel room. Overall we would stay here again we enjoyed our stay and it made our trip more affordable.

We also had to pay £12 a day for beach towels and rubber rings. This is a compulsory charge even if you DONT USE THE ITEMS. Two ladies stayed for 10 days and had to pay £120 for the use of towels!

We used the items when we went to the beach as we were paying for them, when getting the towels from reception the staff are rude and it feels like you are putting them out if there way.The room it's self is very dated, the pillows are like sleeping on a bag of tennis balls. there is a club outside the hotel which is open till 4am and gets VERY LOUD on a weekend!!!

It is much cheaper than most of the hotels in the area. The location in Waikiki is not bad, walking distance to restaurants and shops. Too far to walk to the beach. Our first issue was parking....there is only first-come-first-serve street parking or nearby parking lots/garages for ~$20+. The first time we tried to find parking to check into the hotel, it took so long that the driver just had to circle until I finished checking in and we ran out of time before our dinner reservation. The other times, we found free parking with about a ~ 3-4 block walk to the hotel. Front desk hours are only from 7am-10pm; they don't take check-ins between 10pm and 7am so keep that in mind. At check-in, they provided me with the remote, hairdryer, iron, two sets of two keys, and a stern warning about the fees incurred if any are lost. All those items in addition to my luggage, I left with very full hands. The first time I went into the room I was very unimpressed, vowed to never stay there again. Everything in the room is outdated, the mini window A/C unit rattles and the bed is a Murphy bed. However by the end of the trip, I was satisfied for the price. Pros: The mattress was very comfortable, the water in the shower gets very hot, A/C works, and there are roll away couches in the room that could sleep 2 additional ppl. The front desk offers lots of free beach equipment, and there is a bus/trolley station ride outside the front door to the lobby.Cons: There are no toiletries in the bathroom, checkout is at 10am, there is a $15/day resort fee, and there is a nightclub basically under the hotel which keeps guests awake.

I was concerned about all the bad reviews but it was the cheapest place in all of Waikiki so I couldn't pass it up. I prefer to spend my money on eating out, doing fun activities, and shopping, rather than on a fancy hotel. We paid CAD$980 for the 10 days which is ridiculously cheap for vacationing in Hawaii. The hotel is on the old side, but then again, so is everything else in Honolulu. I found that it exceeded my travel needs. The reception desk staff are very nice, polite, and helpful. The murphy bed was surprisingly very comfortable (although the pillows we a bit lumpy). While there is a club right below the hotel, I never heard any noise from there (we were on the fourth floor). The hotel room has everything you need including a kitchenette with pots, plates, cutlery, microwave, mini fridge, and lots more. And the location is perfect for getting around Waikiki and going to the beach. The wifi was decent as I was able to download stuff to watch at night :-)The one downside is that the hotel has no parking. We were lucky enough to always find a parking spot in the parking lot on Nohonani Street (across White Sands Hotel) where parking is the cheapest I've seen in Waikiki. It was $12 for 12 hours and $18 for 24 hours. If you are arriving after 10pm, call the hotel in advance and they will provide you a passcode for the safe where you can pick up your keys.

At first, I was really scared because some of the reviews were not that kind. However, I do think that the room is totally fine. It's not the biggest room with the Murphy bed pull down, but it has everything one could want for a solo or couple traveling to Oahu. The room is clean, the sofa is actually very comfortable. The shower could be a little bit cleaner but I've had to shower at 24 Hour Fitness which is a million times worst. And with basic kitchen stove, sink and refrigerator, one can save a ton on money if you decided to cook your own meals in pricey Waikiki. TV is small but I'm not in Hawaii for the TV and neither should you be!

The staff were all equally helpful, and friendly. There were some tiny ants that would hang around the sink in the kitchen area. But not enough to bother your food or items placed on the counter. The bed, and couches were ok not lumpy or falling apart. It is best described as a motel than hotel. It did have nice towels chairs and other beach amenities to use. The wifi worked well in our room also. We chose this room because we were interested in seeing the island not hanging in the room. There is no smoking anywhere other than out front of the building. This is also a non smoking area but must be a unwritten rule because that's where we all smoked. Pain in the butt but tollarable, and keeps the room smelling clean Overall I would stay again due to a budget and location.

Oh, and in the morning, when you arrive to check in on your second day, the reception staff will have absolutely no sympathy, but will be very quick to point out the part of the website that has this hidden clause - suspiciously like this has happened many times before, but nothing has been done to fix it - and why would they - paid room for the night with no need to clean it the next morning because we didn't stay!To make the whole thing worse, the following night, we witnessed a family with two young children sitting exactly where we sat the night before, looking totally bereft because obviously the same thing had happened to them. A recurring money-making racket. A simple fix would be to make this condition very obvious and clear on the website - it's not that difficult! Or train the security guard to check guests in after 10pm, if they don't want to pay extra for a receptionist to stay! Incidentally, if you get locked out after 10pm, they charge $45 for someone to come let you in, and even then, they may not bother to answer the phone, so make sure you get locked out with a credit card or be prepared to sleep on the street!When we checked in on our second day, that evening we were asked to move to another room because they needed to do maintenance on the room they had given us a few hours before - total lack of organisation.

Security was good, I felt safe as everything is locked up after 10pm and only accessible with a key. The night club below the hotel as well as the AC unit are both very noisy so earplugs are a must if you wish to get any sleep. Overall we had a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price.. If you want a luxurious plush hotel to stay in then go and pay thousands elsewhere otherwise if you would just like a basic room to lay your head and are not particularly fussy where you stay then I highly recommend this hotel. *WARNING* if you need to check in after 10pm please email them and inform them as they will charge you an extra $45 call out fee and sometimes as I found with a French couple who tried to check in at 10.30pm, no one will come out at all to let you in meaning you will have to stay elsewhere that evening!!

Is there a negative 5? I booked this hotel at the last minute for my three young adult children to stay for the night in Waikiki as an exciting adventure away from our boring seaside cottage in Kaaawa and their boring parents. The last-minute rate was great at $75. After we arrived and asked for possible early check-in or at the very least a place the kids could stow their backpacks, we were flatly refused. The seemingly haole-hating staff asked how many in our party. I said we booked double occupancy and was there an extra person room fee, and they said I'd have to book another room for my third kid. Has that EVER happened? I didn't ask for an extra bed. I've brought my kids all over the world--they've slept in bathtubs for crying out loud. I wasn't going to rent another room with these rigid, not very friendly people, and I certainly wasn't going to ask my kids to draw straws to see who could stay. THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW THREE PEOPLE IN THE ROOM OR GIVE US A BIGGER ONE, even for a fee. So I attempted to cancel the reservation. HAHAHAHAHAHA! Basically, it was, your screwed, and we're taking your money. Not a chance in hell would they work with us. No budging. I hope the 75 bucks and the satisfaction they derived from being jerks to a normal, middle aged mom trying to do something nice for her kids sustains them when their business falls down around their ears, even as their smug expressions remain etched in their koa wood faces.

The Kuhio Banyan could be a decent one if only they actually had some customer service.The location is fine, in the heart of Waikiki a short walk away from the beach and most places, with buses running nearby the further away destinations. The rooms are dated and worn, but functional and the kitchenette is okay for cooking simple meals. Unlike the previous reviewer I actually found the fold-out bed to be quite okay and a neat idea to save space in the room during the day. The room rate at under $90 per night was okay too for Waikiki in July. There's no wifi, but at least my room got a public wifi signal from the street thru the window so that was fine.That's the good parts. Unfortunately the bad parts completely wreck the experience. First of all the reception closes at 10 PM sharp. My flight got in at 10:30 and I was at the hotel an hour later. There was a security guard who advised me that he can call someone to check me in for an additional $45 fee. Well, it's not like I have a choice.The woman who appeared hardly spoke any English apart from informing me that the $45 would be accepted in cash only. Funnily the room charge and the ""security deposit"" ($250) could be paid with a credit card just fine. So that was another $2.75 charge to withdraw the cash from their on-site ATM (no doubt part of it making it into the hotel's accounts). I know why they do this - to avoid people disputing this dubious charge - but yeah, fair it isn't.Oh and check out time is at 10 AM. Since I had a shuttle pick up scheduled for 11 I asked for them to store my bag until then. ""Sir, our hotel policy is not to store any customer bags."" Yeah right? That's the most ridiculous hotel policy I've ever heard of! Only stay at this place if you are a misanthrope and prefer the company of others like you. They don't care about their customers - all they see you as is a walking roll of dollars.Worst hotel I've stayed in for the last three years or so.","Vantaa, Finland","BugBBQ</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Vantaa, Finland</strong>",22,1.0

There was no pre-warning from either Orbitz or the hotel of this check-in condition (Orbitz have since updated the description on their page of the hotel description, however this was not implied when I booked). Essentially, I have spent well over 4 hours and 6 different phone calls (both on the night of the incident, and after my holiday finished) requesting that I be refunded for the new hotel I had to book. They started with apologising and saying ""we're sorry there's nothing we can do"" and then after requesting a supervisor become involved, a $30 voucher was offered and they said ""it's the most we can do for you."" I kept arguing that I was out of pocket $150 (the cost of the new hotel I had to book at midnight that night) so they need to refund me this. They then upped the voucher to $50, and again ""it's the best we can do."" More arguing, and then they offered a $60 voucher and ""this is the absolute best we can do for you."" Orbitz have washed their hands of this entire situation, provided me no support (both on the night and following up on my holiday with their service) and have just lost a customer. On the night of the incident, after being on the phone to them for ~2 hours, they told me there was ""nothing they could do, you'll have to go check yourself into a new hotel out of your own pocket and we'll sort it out later."" Needless to say, the service from Orbitz was abysmal, and I'll never be using them again. On a separate but similar note, I ended up staying at Aqua Waikiki Wave Hotel which was across the road about 150m away. It was slightly more expensive, but more away from the noisy area, very clean, great service. I would definitely recommend this one.","Melbourne, Australia","Mike B</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Melbourne, Australia</strong>",12,1.0

This is by far one of the most reasonable places to stay in Waikiki and though it is not luxurious, it serves its purpose. The rooms are modest, but has all the essentials. The bonus of the whole thing is that it has a kitchenette which makes it really convenient to cook your own food and not have to eat out all the time. My advice for anyone trying to really go Hawaii on a budget is to bring some of your own food from home and buy the necessities when you get here. I brought: cereal (granola-sturdy to hold up while traveling) elbow macaroni (although it was only about 1.29 for a bag at Foodland) peanut butter (Jif to-go), tuna packs (not cans), tortillas, etc. Pretty much anything that was easy to carry and wouldn't break too much during travel. The extra bonus was at the end of my trip I had all that room in my bag to put all my souvenirs! Foodland is 2 small blocks away from the room so it was easy to get staples: milk, spaghetti sauce, mayo, bagels, etc. The bus stop for most buses is right outside the lobby door and you can go to Costco, Sam's, or Walmart for even more savings.I found the front staff to be not as friendly or as helpful this time which was surprising. They were still friendly enough, but it was more out of just being a job rather than really trying to help the guest. I even noticed it when they were helping other guests in the lobby. That was a bummer because the first time I stayed here, they were extremely friendly and over the top helpful.Overall, I would recommend this place. Again, for the price, it is convenient, clean, and very affordable.","Huntington Beach, California","hbgirl-forever</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Huntington Beach, California</strong>",86,5.0

My husband had everyone wait in the car till he found the hotel security guard who helped us with the late checkin. The guard was the best thing about this place, because it went downhill even further. The units were side by side, and neither one had a redeeming feature. The smell of mould and mildew was very strong, the carpet and seating area were stained, the bathroom looked clean, but was in rough shape. At this point we were very tired, the girls went to bed reluctantly. The noise throughout the night continued and the noise of the air con was also very loud.

Unfortunately we were told that check-in is 4pm, there is no available room for me to check in early and there is no luggage storage. I was shocked in disbelief. In my many travels I had never ever been told that there was so storage of luggage at reception. Tired and annoyed, I put all my luggage’s down in front of the reception desk and sat on the chairs in the waiting area.After 5 minutes the receptionist printed some paperwork for me to sign and gave me a tv remote, door swipe and key. The room fan did not work and the air con was loud. Interestingly, the bed was a hidden fold away in a wardrobe (there was only one queen bed, even though the booking request was 2 single beds. I was told that all the suites in this hotel only had one queen bed configurations). The pillows were abominable and flat as a pancake. The room was however, clean and location of the hotel was prime walking distance to everything. Wifi was super slow and even non-existent over 2 days of our stay. We were told that the handyman was fixing the wifi and told to call the telecom company to see why it wasn’t working – this instruction was an even more of a shock to me than the no storage of luggage.A full kitchenette is provided and even a couple hot plates to cook. There is an extra charge for cleaning if you don’t wash everything after use. There is no hair dryer in the bathroom, we had to call reception for one. For some strange reason there wasn’t daily housekeeping in our room. The housekeeper seems to come once over the course of our 4 day stay.The street noise from this room was terrible. There is plenty of noise day and night, especially when the night club below is open late on Saturday nights. Street noise was also considerably loud from this room due to its location and due to the convenience of a bus stop at the front.All in all, this hotel is bare minimal budget – a step above backpacker’s hostels to be honest. If you only need a private room with a lock and don’t want any service, pick this place – having said that there are a lot of better hotels in this price range with much more to offer.

The location is perfect, literally 5 minutes away from central Waikiki. The rooms were nice sized. I really enjoyed having the kitchen (fully stocked with coffee maker, toaster, pots and pans, cups, plates etc.. so you can make breakfast or snacks whenever you want, which was very convenient!). I also enjoyed having the 2 couches... when you come home from a long day at the beach and just want to relax, it was great to just sit on them and chill out for a bit (versus some hotel rooms that only have a bed to sit on.. not nearly as comfortable). My friend and i were able to come home some nights and just drink a bottle of wine and chat on the couch, very cozy.The bed is a pull down, which at first was slightly hilarious (have never seen that before!) but honestly it was comfortable enough and you get 4 pillows, which was nice. Some people complain that the place wasn't clean - i found it to be perfectly clean. The cleaning service only comes twice a week, which for some travelers may be off putting, but really if you're just using the room as a place to sleep, it doesn't matter much. They give you plenty of towels to last you that long.I stayed at the Maile Sky Court before (a better rated hotel) but I actually prefer the Kuhio Banyan club more. The Maile sky court room was more expensive and was much smaller (no couches), so the room wasnt as comfortable to come home to. Yes, it's more of your average hotel, so it was cleaner and more modern, but if you don't care as much about cleaning service or front desk manners, then stay at the Kuhio banyan hotel - a great budget friendly hotel.Downside: No parking, and parking in Waikiki is an extreme pain.

He is a very ""beach-front-resort"" kind of man while I could camp outside and be fine. As such, I had few complaints about this place as compared to him! The bed was a little uncomfortable, the TV was old school and not visible when the bed was down, but the benefit of having a kitchenette was invaluable! On top of that, the club provides you with the chance to check out boogie boards, floats, coolers, and beach chairs for your whole stay! The reviews are definitely true that the night clubs outside are LOUD. Play Bar is right downstairs and they go until 4:00am. We were both able to sleep just fine but I can see this being a downside, especially for families. There is no pool and there is pretty much no parking to be found so keep that in mind! Overall, I would say that as long as you are okay with a bit of an old school style hotel, the location and price is definitely right at the Kuhio Banyan! The staff there were very friendly and helpful and we loved having a Food Pantry, ABC, and key bus stops so close.

Kuhio banyan said that if we wanted to check in after 10pm, we would have to pay them $250USD for someone to come and do it - we passed and stayed with a friend. The next morning we went in to check in. It was well before check in time but we figured, since we had had the room booked since the previous day, the room would be available for us - it wasn't. We were told there wasn't a room for us and that they had probably given it away. How can they give it away when we had paid for it? We ended up having to go back after 3pm to check in. We were tempted not to stay but because we had already booked and paid for the accommodation through booking.com, we were unable to get a refund.

Perfect if you don't have a car and a few minute's walk to everything including beach, bus stops, and Food Pantry (very importantly if you plan to cook your own meals). Got a queen room w/ kitchenette (I think they all have kitchenettes) for about $95/night w/ tax. This place is not worth more than that. We also loved that it's right next to the best udon place in Waikiki - Marukame Udon (great, fast, cheap eat).- KITCHENETTE W/ SUPPLIES: Room comes w/ mini fridge, microwave, 2-burner stove, dishes, pots, pans, utensils, and roll of paper towel. - FRIENDLY & HELPFUL STAFF: There's someone at the front desk from 7am-10pm. Beach towels, beach umbrellas, coolers available to check out for free. I think other things like boogie board and snorkel equipment costs money. Staff also allowed us to check in early (check in time was listed as after 4pm but we got our room at 1pm), held our luggage, checked us in for our flight and printed our boarding passes. There's also a night security guard. Yes there is a club downstairs but we never saw any shady people hanging around during our 7 night stay but it was nice to know there's a security guard.OK:- BED: not luxurious but had a foam top and was comfortable enough.CONS:- OLD & RUNDOWN FEEL: old worn out carpet (I never went barefoot) and furniture, water stains on the ceiling, but the linens, kitchen area, and bathroom were clean which is what I really cared about.- WINDOWS DON'T OPEN, ROOM VERY DARK: windows are tinted purple and don't open which means there's no natural ventilation and even during the day w/ the shades open, the room felt very dark and dingy. Because the windows didn't open we avoided cooking anything that could make our stuff smell. There is an AC unit and at least there's a ceiling fan for some air movement. W/o the fan on, the room could smell a little stale due to lack of fresh air but we didn't notice any odors.- SMALL ROOMS: with the murphy bed down there's hardly any space to walk around. Not comfortable for more than 2 people and especially not for children or older people. - NOISY: it's in an busy area w/ a club so was only bad on Friday & Saturday nights. I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't bother me much.- NO PARKING: don't plan on having a car here.- NO WIFI: didn't really matter since we used our phone for internet but bad if you plan to have a laptop.OVERALL: This was a last minute trip and I didn't spend much time looking for lodging. Since we stayed 7 nights and wanted to cook for ourselves (some of the meals), I would look instead for a nicer more comfortable condo with parking (there seems to be lots of those for rent near the canal- look on Tripadvisor). We didn't plan on spending much time in our room which is why we got a cheap older centrally located place but the time we did spend in there cooking and eating wasn't all that great because the room felt cramped and dingy.","Seattle, Washington","alkikat</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seattle, Washington</strong>",29,3.0

It is pretty much your most basic of accommodations, but when you're in Hawaii what more do you need than a clean place to sleep and shower? I was barely in the room the whole time I was there and it was perfect. My room even had a small kitchenette which really saved me from having to eat out all the time. I brought some small food things with me from home and went to Walmart or Food Pantry (which is two blocks away) for other basic food items. Eating out can get expensive in Hawaii, not to mention not always healthy, so it was nice to have a small fridge, two burner stove, and a microwave. They also supplied all the utensils, pots, pans, etc. Even a can opener! The staff is really friendly and were patient with all my questions I had about the bus. (which is conveniently located right outside the front door) The only thing I had trouble with was locating it when I first arrived. You must enter from the courtyard next to the Nail Salon.

We had made a reservation through Priceline and received a confirmation from Priceline. We never received any confirmation from the Kuhio Banyan Club but were not concerned assuming there would be someone on site to check us in. Upon arrival at about 11:30 PM we noted a locked door with office hours that closed at 10:00 PM. There was a security guard onsite who tried his best to help us. He made several phone calls to Kuhio Banyan managers and staff but none were willing to come to the ""hotel"" and let us in. At about 1:30 AM we finally gave up and returned to the airport where we thought we would just wait in the terminal for our flight at 12:30 PM with a hope that maybe we could get on an earlier flight as standby. Unfortunately the terminal was closed and we ended up staying at an airport hotel. I complained to the Kuhio Banyan Club and asked for a refund. They offered a free stay at a later date. Bottom line was Kuhio Banyan accepted no responsibility to have someone on site and said it was my responsibility to let them know we were going to arrive late. However they sent me no confirmation stating this policy and indicated either my wife and I or Priceline was at fault. My guess is they were full and had no rooms available and that is why no Kuhio Banyan staff was willing to come and help us.

The location could not get better (aside from the luxurious hotels on the waterfront). You are right in heart of Waikiki within short walking distance to all major attractions. The bus stop is right in front of the hotel, which was important to me as I have used it. For instance, I have went by bus to Pearl Harbor, which was a very memorable experience. I did not want to take an organized tour as I wanted to set my own steady pace to explore that place.  Now, the price is high, but it is probably cheapest one in the area. Now, one of my airport shuttle bus drivers has mentioned that one can find even cheaper accommodations, but Kuhio was clearly the cheapest in the list of hotels offered by most hotel search engines that I have looked at prior to my trip. Now, their reception closing at 10 p.m. is obviously a bizarre feature, and that is mentioned in lost of review. I suppose that many flights get into Honolulu airport late in the evening, so this creates a difficulty for people checking in Kuhio. I have made it there by 9:50 p.m., so I was lucky. Two ladies at the reception were ready to run out of this place. I wonder what is behind this policy... Trying to earn more money for the hotel (calling security guard and paying him 45 bucks just to get to your room after many hours of flying)? Possibly.If you believe that you will be not making to this hotel for the check-in before 10 p.m. do call them in advance. I did and they were quite nice to me and provided me with a phone number of a security guard, so that I would not have to wait for him to show up next to a closed hotel door for too long. They have also provided me with a pin code to a safe where my room was to be. They only do it when you call them and not via e-mail. Anyway, they had time to make me go through a lot of paperwork before letting me off and going home themselves. I have never ever seen so many receipts and signed so many receipts before while checking in a hotel, and I am a frequent traveler. Yes, they charge 50 dollars a night as a security deposit for the incidentals right away. I worried about it a little, but to their credit, they have released the charged amount to my account rather quickly upon my checking-out. Now, the room was all right. TV, air conditioner, coffee-maker, fridge were functioning fine. Well, A/C was little noisy, but one does need it on all night long in Waikiki. Bathroom was all right, but I had to fix the toilet flash occasionally as water just kept on running otherwise. The room is quite spacious, of a studio type. The bed was comfortable, pillows were too. Bedclothes were clean. So, I wonder what other reviewers have referred to, or, maybe, they have got worse rooms than I did.  There is a noisy disco downstairs. I was fortunate to have a room at the very end of that wing of the hotel, which is opposite to where the disco is. So, it did not bother me, but I can guess that it is much more disturbing in some other rooms. The cleaning of the room was not done even once through my 4 days and 5 nights of stay there. So, this could be seen as a problem by some people. The area around the hotel is all right. Yes, you see lots of beggars and street walkers as well, but so what. They are harmless and you just walk by them and mind your business. So, in short, Kuhio Banyan has made it for me.","Odessa, Ukraine","vladimir70</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Odessa, Ukraine</strong>",98,3.0

We booked several nights at this hotel in Waikiki because it was cheap, and we assumed some of the bad reviews were written by snobs so we made the mistake of ignoring them. We arrived from the the airport at 12 am. Our flight had been delayed, but my confirmation from Orbitz stated that check-in time was between 4pm and 10am....so I assumed it was a 24 hour hotel and didn't bother calling from the airport. Not the case. We ran into a nice security guard that explained it would be a $45.00 fee for the hotel manager to drive over with our room key. We said that was fine and waited for over an hour for the manager to answer his or her phone, but ultimately the three employees that were contacted all refused to bring us a key. So we were left stranded in Waikiki with our hiking packs in the middle of the night. Awesome. We never got a refund from the hotel or from Orbitz, who really made the mistake here. So a week later for our next reservation at Kuhio Banyan, we expected the worse....which we determined would be if there were no beds in the room. We go up to the room, and don't see a bed.....because it pulled out of a closet. A cardboard box would have been much better. After we settled in we made our way out for dinner, and while passing through the front lobby we heard a Japanese girl yelling from inside a utility closet. Somehow she got locked in there? The lady at the front desk was on the phone and wasn't phased by us letting her know what was going on, but she did get up to unlock the door at least....and out comes running this girl who looked like she was about to cry. But then it gets worse. When we get back from dinner I take the elevator up and get locked in there. At this point things were so ridiculous all I could do was laugh, and I was able to pry the door open so I didn't completely freak out. If you stay here, you should expect to cry at some point during your visit.

It was a studio like room, torn dirty gross carpet, the couch was dirty, faded Miami Vice color decorated. The bed came from the wall (like the 70s where you pull it down). It was a bad mattress like you feel the springs. It had a small refrigerator, a mini kitchen, bar area. The bathroom was old like just like an old run down beach place. No glam at all. Parking was bad, we had to pay $14 a night I believe in 2009. We did give the front desk cash for the parking for the attendant. We got taxed $163 for 8 days in a crummy place. It was on the main road strip, in front of a bus stop where a lot of bums lurk & bum money from us. Jack in the Box & Subway was also next to us so foot traffic was busy.

The cons to this property are as follows:The rooms are small. The 3 of us just barely fit and I would not try to fit a fourth. The Murphy bed is not what the average person is used to. Personally I sleep on a king sized pillow top foam mattress at home. The furnishings are dated. Think Starsky and Hutch or Hawaii Five-O. No pool. No activities to speak of. The neighborhood is a little sketchy.That being said the rooms are OK for two people and they are clean. If you request an egg crate foam mattress topper the bed is quite tolerable. This is not a luxury resort where you would loll around and soak up the ambiance. As far as the neighborhood goes one must remember that Waikīkī is the tourist district of Honolulu, located between the Ala Wai Canal and the Pacific Ocean next to Diamond Head. Numerous hotels, shops, and nightlife opportunities are located along Kalakaua and Kuhio Avenues. It is a popular location for visitors and locals alike and attracts millions of visitors every year. The attraction here is Oahu and Waikiki Beach. Like any large city (2011 census estimate over 936,000) you find the homeless, prostitution and crime. You also find this in Small Town USA. Due vigilance is required. Being central to all of the activities is the biggest assest this property has. The second biggest is the staff who embody the true Aloha spirit and bend over backwards to accommodate you. They have beach chairs, umbrellas, coolers and coolers available to rent which was very handy. I would not recommend this property to everyone. For the young party crowd it works extremely well. Even a couple if you truly are there to see Oahu and only sleep in the room. Overall I would give it a 2 ½ star rating and that high because of the location and the staff.

At the last minute the other couple had to cancel. I was so glad they did because when I saw the place I was absolutely horrified and would have been very embarrassed for them to see this place. They were going to join us as our guest. I felt very uncomfortable staying there and if it wasn't for my husband who was able to tolerate the place, I would have packed up and left the next day. The shower was horrible and I felt very unclean even after having taken a shower. I could hardly stand to sleep in the bed and did not sleep well during the entire time. Also, there was a drunk hanging around outside and some lady on the phone talking very loudly at 2:00 am. The first morning that I got up to go for my run, there were police and a fire truck parked outside as someone from the bar got into a fight and had to go to the hospital. I don't want to go into what the rest of the week was like. Suffice it to say that every morning there was a new adventure awaiting me when I got up to go for my run. I have stayed in some pretty bad places and for the most part, am able to stand it.

I had decided to go ahead and give the place a try.When my party and I, 3 total, first checked in, we were warmly greeted. They gave us two sets of keys, a tv remote, and a card key for the room safe. I was a little surprised to see each set of keys had two keys attached to the ring. I was told one was for the room, and the other was for the main door after it was locked at night. That's right; there is no 24/7 service here. Staff is there from 7am to 10pm each day. If you're out past 10pm, you need a key to get back into the place. Don't have it? You're probably going to have to call someone from staff to drive all the way out to this place and let you back in, which can be up to a 2 hour wait and a $45 charge. I made sure to have my key on my person at all times so I wouldn't end up in this predicament.The single elevator here is the smallest I've ever seen. It didn't smell when I got on it, but the carpet certainly looked old. Me and my group were squeezed tightly into the small space of the elevator as we made our way up to our room, which was on the top-most floor.Now the balcony leading to the room, there was a neighboring building right in front of us which looked like a residential building. I couldn't tell exactly if this really was Section 8 housing as another reviewer brought up. The entire time I was here, I didn't really see any residents out. However, there were two nights I heard a young woman arguing on a phone about some troubled relationship of hers. It sounded like it was coming straight from this residential building. This was around 4am in the morning. But this is nothing. There are a couple of bars nearby the Banyan, blaring music early in the night with people loudly talking and laughing up a storm. The first few nights I stayed here, I had trouble sleeping, but got quickly adjusted to it and it didn't bother me.Moving on to the room, when I first entered it, it was clean. The furniture and carpet seriously are old and worn, though. They're simply begging to be replaced. The bathroom was nice save for the grungy shower tiles. They looked as though they haven't been cleaned in a decade. I didn't dare step barefoot onto them but rather wore an old pair of sandals while showering.I did stumble upon a baby cockroach one evening in the bathroom. It scared the life out of me before shooting into a crack in the wall. Luckily, I had some boric acid on hand. I sprinkled a little around the cracks and didn't see another cockroach (I also made sure to keep the entire unit tidy as possibile).The entire place is a small step up from a Motel 6, but only by a hair. It was still comfy, so I tried not to make a fuss much. I didn't stay here too much, only as a place to sleep in mostly. The two things I liked about this place were the staff and most importantly, the location. The staff were very helpful in any questions I had, including different destinations and the different routes aboard the Bus. For location, many shops are so close by, as well as numerous restaurants. The beach is a short walk away, too.Although the Kuhio Banyan wasn't too far from many local attractions and the unit had a few extras such as a stove-top burner (pretty basic; see photos to get an idea what they look like), I'd be hesitant to recommend this place to others. To be honest, I'm drawn down the line as to whether I'd tell people to look elsewhere or to give this place a shot. The few perks of this place had won me over somewhat, but then again, the cons, such as that roach, the loud night noise, and let me not forget to mention that one bum constantly wandering in front of the Banyan, have me disliking this place. What I will recommend to travelers out there is to definitely do your homework and look for a good deal on a nice hotel. If by the chance you're not able to come across anything you like, only then would I recommend the Kuhio Banyan as a fair location to try.","Newburgh, New York","summer_rose8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Newburgh, New York</strong>",6,3.0

We weren't sure what to expect so were pleasently surprised when we arrived to a welcoming check-in, a clean room and an outstanding location. Folks who are upset at their less than palatial surroundings should get a clue by the amount of points required to stay there. The floors were clean, the counters were clean, the refrigerator worked, the bathroom was clean. It isn't the Ritz. In fact, our home resort is beachfront on another island. But, if one is intent on staying in Waikiki, they could do a lot worse (we have in the past). The only drawback we could find was the necessity of keeping the air conditioner on 24/7, as there is no ventilation. Again, one is downtown so open windows aren't quite as nice as they are on a beach. The Kuhio Banyan is a couple of notches above Motel 6, without the pool. And, even most of the hotels in Waikiki depend on A/C, and dicourage open lanai doors.That said, TheBus is absolutely fantastic. $2.50 per adult one way anywhere a tourist would like to go and all of the routes from Waikiki stop directly in front. The 2 Bus travels to many of the most desireable locations and runs every 10-15 minutes (no way to really keep a schedule in that traffic). With public transportation like this, there is no need for a rental car unless you just have to have one - and parking is horrible. Spend $5 at the ABC store and get TheBus Map and Guide Book.To sum up, as the realtors say, location, location, location. Lots of great shows, restaurants and shops within easy walking distance, from a clean location.

The elevator had old carpet that smelled like urine, mixed with mold & mildew. The rooms were trashed; sand everywhere, old smelly room, with filthy furniture. RCI states these studios would accommodate up to 4 people, which is unrealistic because you couldn’t pull the other beds out after dropping the bed from the cabinet.

The furniture is beat up, and worn. The cleanliness is questionable, we never took of our socks. The murphy bed was so bad, we slept on the 2 sofas, only to be woken at 3:30am by a bar fight from the adjoining night club. The rooms still use keys, and only have a safety chain, no dead bolt. There is no night staff after 10pm. We did not feel safe in this area at all.

The kitchen corner of the room had virtually everything you could think of, and the bathroom was big. The place is not new, but it appeared clean.In the night, however, I came back to the room and about 20 baby roaches were hanging out in the sink of the kitchen corner. I killed all, but later, more came out from the sink and exploring the whole kitchen. I killed ost of them before my girlfriend saw them. I just told her that we are not alone. I sealed the sink and went to bed with lights on, terrified. During the night I had to switch off the air conditioning and the fridge because they were too loud.

For how much my husband and I pay for a timeshare, ANY timeshare in the RCI network should NOT look like this. I understood I took risks when I switched out, but I thought RCI had SOME standards. First of all, BUGS. I am a bug phobe. There were two baby cockroaches and a FULL sized one found in our one week stay (and by full size, I mean by Hawaiian standards. The kind that grow to deathly sizes). I pay for a two bedroom timeshare normally, but the bedrooms that they had in my building were awful. They didnt have a bedroom. Not kidding. There was a murphy bed (one that comes from the wall), and two that were created if you removed the couch cushions, and I dont mean fold-out. The kitchen was well stocked, and the staff was nice. However, it doesnt help if the staff is nice if there is only one, to two people working. Lines were always horrendous at the front desk. Furthermore, my husband was born and raised in Hawaii, so he is by all standards ""local,"" and there is some stigma to being in Waikiki. If you are looking to do tourist things, then Waikiki is the place to be, but it is by no means ""authentic Hawaii."" If you are looking for authentic Hawaii, please travel beyond the borders of Waikiki. ONE OF THE WORST things were the prostitutes. In my fathers days, the prostitutes congregated on Hotel St. NOW they are on KUHIO Ave!!!! Their Samoan pimp and his backup were on every corner. If I weren't with my husband he would have gotten mobbed by prostitutes!!!!!!!!! It was also very crappy to stay on back side of the building. You are literally about 6 feet from the balcony of section 8 housing. Beware! Theres even underwear in the TREE inbetween the two balconies...unable to be retrieved and removed!!!If you DO want Waikiki its the place to be, but DO NOT expect luxury!!!!!! The only good thing I have to say is that the kitchen was well stocked and the staff was nice.ALSO, NO PARKING!!!!

You are right on Waikiki, and I had the GO Oahu card, had arranged all the tours, therefore we only came in to sleep. Not the most comfortable sleep, a Murphy bed, with a TV that you can't watch once you open the bed, but we were so tired from our day out that it really did not matter. I only recommend this ""resort"" Ha ha ha......if you are on a budget. Staying here allowed us to do other things. Oahu is expensive, if you are traveling with kids, bring cereal to get you started on your day. A box of cheerios or Honey clusters is $7.00 milk $9.00 gallon........ peanut butter 3.00 for an 8oz as well as jelly same price. International Market across the street, thursdays is farmers market, lots of reasonable priced fruit, after paying 3.80 for two apples, 99cents for a banana. The staff was friendly, that and the location made up for the terrible accommodations. They should at least splurge on replacing the mattress and replacing the covers on the small couches. The bathrooms also need a lot of help. I had second thoughts about sitting on the couch. Ok for two people, but 4 would be impossible.......The 19 takes you from and to the airport, no need to pay for a shuttle unless you have lots of luggage. Roberts Hawaii dominates the sightseeing market and they are the most reasonable for airport shuttle, I think 15 or 16 bucks round trip. 19 bus $2.25 stops right in-front of the ""resort"" ha ha ha. No need to rent a car. The Bus and the trolly's take you everywhere. I would recommend this only if you are on a budget. Hawaii is over rated...... Oh! you have to pay, an additonal $70 something for the use of beach towels, chairs, and hotel tax. You have to ""sign out the blow dryer, iron, ironing board. No shampoo, and cheap soap so take your own. Sun screen is not expensive is the same price and you don't take the chance of the airport personnel keeping your sun screen...... Subway in the complex, as well as a Japanese take our fast food, pretty good and reasonable. Also they have a restaurant similar to Benihana's that was good and reasonable. I think the name was Takana or Tanaka??? sp",,lec77,21,2.0

We had to stand on the curb for 3 hours until someone came to open the office. While waiting there was a homeless person on the steps of the hotel throwing up. We then entered the most claustraphobic (sp?) elevator in the world. You have to make two trips to get two people and suitcases upstairs(slim people). We unlocked our room door (lock looks like a bathroom lock) and walked back into the late 70s early 80s. The room was clean but the stained carpets and chairs did not feel clean. The bathroom tiles were mildewed. Needless to say, we left to stay at the Marriott on the beach. This hotel is two blocks from the beach. The hotel is okay if you are drunk frat boys looking for a place to ""crash"" for spring break.","Virginia Beach, Virginia","dockc</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Virginia Beach, Virginia</strong>",3,2.0

Overall, we had a nice time. The rooms are very small, which was fine with us, since there were only two of us. They could use a little updating though. There were some stains on the rug, but nothing major. There is a small kitchen which had everything you should need, including silverware, dishes, glasses and some pots and pans. There is also a laundry room (to wash was $1.25 and to dry was $ .75), which was nice to have. The murphy bed was fine, our only gripe was that the tv is right next to the bed, so when you pulled the bed out, both people couldn't see the tv when you were lying there. You had to have your head at the opposite end of the bed to be able to see it, and even then, only one person could see it due to the closet doors (that hold the bed in) being in the way. To some this may not be a big deal, but we like to lay in bed and watch tv!The location is right downtown, and only two blocks from the beach. We personally had a little trouble finding the entrance. It's set amid a little strip mall, and we literally had to go around the block 5 or 6 times before we found it, and then there was no place to park.If you love shopping and going out at night, this is a great place for you. We personally like to be a little more secluded, and are not really into the night scene, so this wasn't a great selling point for us. There is a nightclub at the one end of the hotel, and, even though we were at the total opposite end, we could still hear the music late at night. Luckily when the air conditioner kicked on, it covered it up for the most part, but not entirely. There is also a bus stop right outside, which would be great for people who would want to use it. The International Marketplace is right across the street, and there are tons and tons of shops and restaurants within walking distance.The staff was very friendly and helpful. We received a beautiful lei when we checked in. They have beach chairs, umbrellas, coolers and other items to rent which was extremely helpful. It was so nice not to have to buy these items, then worry about what we were going to do with them once we leave. I believe a previous reviewer said that the cost of these was around $70, but I believe that price was for the Hawaii hotel tax, not for the equipment rental. I'm pretty sure that I remember the lady at the desk saying that $7.50 covered the costs of the chairs and things, but I can't be 100% sure. I'm sure if you called them you could confirm this detail.Paying over $100 to park for the week did not excite me, but if you don't get a rental car, obviously you wouldn't have to deal with this.The Kuhio Banyan is pretty much a no frills place. If you want luxury, you are not going to find it here. If you basically want a place to sleep at night after shopping, being on the beach, eating out and clubbing, then you will be fine here. We were gone pretty much all day, and really only slept there, so for us, it was fine. Also, It's probably not a great family place, just because of the noise from the nightclub and that there is no pool.",PA,"shorty20Pa</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>PA</strong>",15,3.0

I needed to use an RCI week and was heading to Waikiki anyway and that was all that was available for that particular week which I needed. Thanks to other reviews on trip advisor, I knew to ask for the egg crate foam for the murphy bed mattress which was too hard for me as I realized the first night. I called the front desk the first morning I was there and the foam was added to my bed and remade before I got back from the activities briefing --very responsive. The rooms are small --OK for two people --but would be crowded for more even though the couch and loveseat turn into twin beds. The closet is in the bathroom. The rooms were clean and the location is great with the bus stops just outside. We rented a car only one day because we didn't want to deal with the parking issue and we'd been there before and didn't need to use the bus too much. (THE BUS only takes what luggage you could carry on to a plane.) The backpack beach chairs were nice and other equipment is available but each room is required to pay the same fee upon check out (I think it was about $70) which covered use of equipment whether you use it or not. If this were the only RCI condo available, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.","Cabo San Lucas, Mexico","cindyguk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Cabo San Lucas, Mexico</strong>",46,3.0
