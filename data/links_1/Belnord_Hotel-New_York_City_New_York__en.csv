That being said, there is no insulation between the rooms. As an example, I could hear the person in the next room flicking through their TV at 1am. Also, any movement in the corridor is very loud, such as the cleaning staff at 8am the next day. If you can sleep through anything/are ok with earplugs then maybe you will be ok. The bedroom isn't large and the bathroom is tiny but it will be fine if you're by yourself. Personally, I would advise spending an extra $25 for a better hotel. ",,Adventure767527,3,2.0

The location was perfect. I had the option to stay with friends but preferred the privacy that a hotel would offer. It was clean, room 410 was renovated with new linens and a large screen tv. Like other reviews mention, the room is the size of a shoe box. I got a Queen bed which took up 90% of the floor space. Fine for one person, but I wouldn't stay here as a couple. They leave space under the beds for your suitcase. There was a tiny bathroom and closet. The whole room was smaller than my baby nursery at home.I think of it like a single dorm room in college, or a spiffy Youth Hostel, with no place for a desk or any furniture besides a bed. The bed was fine, it is clean and comfortable. Something to note of is that there is a staircase at the entrance. I had to drag my luggage up that and struggled a bit. The front desk reception were courteous. A friend had left a gift basket which was waiting for me upon arrival. I am happy I chose this hotel, and if I needed to be on the Upper West Side again I would certainly choose the Belnord.","White Plains, New York","390gailr</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>White Plains, New York</strong>",6,4.0

The hotel reminds me of what they do to you when you go skiing - ie they know demand is high so they can over price and under deliver on all aspects of the service. I think people are willing to overlook this because it’s New York but there is absolutely no value for money to be found by staying here.There is no double glazing so the default temperature in the rooms is freezing. This can be made up for by using the air con / heating system but this is very loud and causes problems if you are a light sleeper (which I’m not but my partner is).It’s also incredibly noisy outside and you can hear the sirens, people screaming in the street, the clattering of who knows what and the homeless going through the huge piles of rubbish outside on the street.The decor hasn’t been changed for something like 20 years, there is minimal investment into the appearance of the rooms and cheap furniture throughout.It’s just a bit grim - it is fine if you are spending all day outside exploring New York but at the same time you will want some value for money which you won’t really find here.

The room was clean and had good facilities and the bed was comfortable. It’s located in a nice area with close subway stops (86th Street) and we could easily access all the main tourist spots within 30/40minutes.Unfortunately the room was freezing cold due to the windows being very thin; there was a constant draft coming into the room to the point where it felt like the windows were open. There is heating but it’s a very noisy fan system so we slept badly as it was either the fan noise or the cold keeping us awake. The windows meant all outside noise was really amplified too.

The bed was very comfortable and the hotel itself was cute with the blue shades and sparkly walls! Take advantage of the free coffee in each kitchen because they remove it in the afternoon. The location is amazing! 10 min walk and your in Central Park, plus the subway is literally 1 street down from the hotel. Getting to Times Square is a piece of cake, just hop on the red line 1,2, or 3 trains to downtown and in about 5 stops you’ll be in Times Square ,42nd. This location is nice when you want to unwind from the hectic loud Times Square area. But if you’re wanting the loud (like I did my very 1st time in NY) then this area may be too quiet and chill for you. You will see many homeless folks in Times Square, I recommend giving them your leftovers if you have any on hand. Always pay it forward when you can!

It's not luxury by any stretch. BUT, it's comfortable and well-placed. And it's clean. And since they've reimagined the inside, it's quite nice. Again, I rate on a scale of what you should expect from a hotel on this level. It's NOT 4 stars because it's THE RITZ. It's 4 star -- b/c you get exactly what you expect. And rooms are small, yes. But it's NYC. You are very close to Central Park. You are close to quiet places to eat. We like the UWS b/c it gives a true taste of NYC -- not Times Square, etc. That's overplayed. And so far, Belnord hasn't gone to ridiculous RESORT fees like most other hotels in NYC today. I would suggest a TWIN room at the very least -- we've done the bunks, too.. but it truly is hyper small. Good enough for a weekend.. which we do often.. but if you want a bit of space -- a twin room is good enough. We've stayed here a few times now, it we are still not disappointed. Beds are comfy, showers are hot, and the AC -- works.You really cannot ask for more in NYC for a weekend of fun -- that won't break your bank.","Miami, Florida","eshepard</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Miami, Florida</strong>",32,4.0

The room was small, a bit like being on a cruise ship. This was as expected after reading previous review and not a problem, we just packed smaller suitcases had plenty of space. The rooms were cleaned daily, there is coffee and filtered water available at every floor, the area felt safe and had lots of cafes and restaurants (we had breakfast at City Diner on 90th street twice). The only negative part about this hotel is the loud noise from the air-condition. The air-con is built into the ceiling which means that when the air-con is on downstairs the whole floor vibrates and there is a loud deep rumbling sound. Add that to our own air-con running and it feels and sounds like you are close to the engine of a ship (adding to the feeling of sleeping on a cruise ship). We had earplugs so it was no problem!

You have to go through Expedia. Also, the hotel does not tell you that if you leave early you need to call Expedia to notify them of the cancellation and get a refund. When I asked the hotel staff to call a taxi, one arrived quickly BUT...2/3 of the way to my destination I noticed not credit card reader. The driver told me he only took cash. This is not an acceptable way to travel in New York City and I had to use almost all my remaining cash which I had needed for my trip home! The room itself was rather nice and recently refurbished but the bathroom is tiny and the shower entry is extremely narrow. If you are a large framed or overweight person you simply will not fit through the opening. The shower leaked but instead of near the shower it formed a dangerous puddle directly in front of the sink. The toilet seat was loose and not repaired during my visit. The ice buckets are kept in the basement atop the quite tall ice machine (very difficult for a short person like me to reach) and the first one I chose was dirty! There is no ramp, the stairs make a heavy suitcase hard to manage, there is no doorman, and you are on your own getting in and out. The television is quite high on the wall which at first seemed nice but the angle does not make for healthy viewing (your neck will not be happy). The bedding and bed were VERY comfortable and towels soft. Shampoo, conditioner, and soap were provided. The shade does a good job of blocking out light but the curtains do not reach the wall on both sides! There is a distinct gap on either side. If you are on a low floor this is an issue. Safety was never a problem, vending machines with snacks and water are downstairs, and while there is a computer for guest use BEWARE! The computer indicates 20 cents per minute with, I believe, a $10 minimum but during the sign-in process you are informed that it is actually 35 cents a minute! I told the hotel lobby staff that, ""I respectfully request that you change this immediately."" You will have a 24 hour hold for a $10 deposit but my hold took 3 days to come off my bank account. Also, since I used a debit rather than credit card to pay for my room I had to pay a $200 deposit but there was no problem with that financial aspect. Once I called Expedia and asked for a refund, the process will take at least 5 business days and possibly longer. Therefore, since the hotel failed to notify me to call Expedia to start the refund process, it is about 10 days since I checked out the refund process is just now starting. The neighborhood has lots of nice places to eat including Kirsh on Amsterdam and 87th, less than 1 block away, and an Indian restaurant right around the corner with very good food and lovely staff.

You walk over Columbia and Amsterdam and there you are to Central Park so near.Hotel room are small - there are a few bigger one - gives you a little bit of room. Unless it is very tight. They have designed the rooms so cases can be put away under the bed. They are nicely decorated (think they had a make over) and done very tasteful. I think some of the bathrooms could do with a bit more work. A stronger Shower curtain is a definite! On each floor there is a kitchen which has a coffee/tea station which is great. Room are cleaned everyday - clean towels etc.. However, they can get to your room late, but they will take wet towels and give you clean.

Once I moved to a higher level floor, it wasn’t an issue. It’s definitley a no-frills hotel with very basic amenities. You can hear your neighbors each time doors are open and closed and there’s poor noise insulation. White noise app seemed to remedy this a bit though.Rooms are very VERY small.

The shower goes from hot to cold every 15 seconds or so, which makes showering pretty miserable as well. A few nights into our stay, our air conditioner started making super loud noises, like a diesel engine was running in our room. When we called the front desk, they said they would see if they could open our windows to keep it cool in our room, so the AC didn't keep us awake at night. The maintenance man arrived with a screw driver, and was unable to open the window. The front desk told us their tool box was locked up and they didn't have access to the necessary tools to open the window for us. Needless to say, we had a sleepless night. When we spoke to the supervisor on duty the next day (Chris), he told us he spoke with the manager, and they were unwilling to compensate us at all for the previous night in which we had no air conditioning and were unable to sleep.

I had a single room with queen bed. There was no desk, dresser, or chair. There were drawers in a small cabinet under the bed. Closet and bathroom were small, but well appointed and adequate. Front desk was courteous and helpful. Building interior was clean and new looking. Location was great, near American Museum of Natural History, Central Park, shopping on Broadway. local Broadway #1 subway at 86th Street, and express stop for #2 and #3 subways at 96th Street and 72nd Street, and Columbia University and Barnard College at 116th Street. The nightly rate during mid-November was about one third less than the other large hotels in the area. The Hotel calls itself a ""boutique hotel,"" although it has around 120 rooms. I understand that the hotel is managed by personnel of Greek heritage who have attractive pictures of Greece on the walls and a Greek directory of New York in the hall.

The Belnord Hotel location is an excellent in that regard, it is located in the middle east side of Manhattan (Hudson river side), which is a good standard and safe residential area and the hotel is surrounded by of variety of shops and decent quality restaurants, and most importantly access to the New York Metro 1 line (Underground), which for $3 can take to you the tip of Manhattan's financial district, to Times Square/Penn Station or into Harlem and Bronx in the other direction. The hotel is a few blocks walking distance to central park and is perfect for you are into exploring and experiencing NY by walking the city streets.I found the Hotel staff to be friendly and helpful, the hotel can arrange fixed rate taxi service and a considerably cheaper shuttle service from the hotel to the NY airports. Used the shuffle service, the driver was friendly and funny, The latest room checkout is by 12 noon, however, you can store your luggage securely at the hotel should you have a late flight.So the location is spot on for tourists, staff are friendly, the trade-off with the Belnord is the size of the hotel rooms, which are tiny, but thankfully the rooms do come with their own bathrooms, and we found our room and bathroom to be perfectly clean, with linen and towels changed daily. For us this is an acceptable trade-off given price and location, as all we needed the hotel for was for a bed and shower for our sightseeing visit of New York City, but if you are after a larger hotel room, perhaps you need a desk to work at for business, you should consider other hotels but you'll pay considerably more per night if they are within the Manhattan borough, or alternatively you take a trade-off of staying outside of Manhattan Island and getting more bang for your buck hotel wise but be willing to commute in. The Hotel provides free Wifi, the access code changed every day, it worked fine. Just on the lack of desk for business users in the hotel rooms, there is a small business centre in the hotel which didn't look practical to work at, however, it is worth noting we saw many New Yorkers using their local Starbucks as a mobile desk to work at, so that could be a good alternative if you are visiting on business.As I said earlier in this review, within a couple of blocks of the Belnord Hotel are a good variety of restaurants and shops, I recommend the Han Dynasty for good quality Chinese meals, Big Daddies for American Dinner food, French Roast for quality French food and Mermaid Inn for seafood. Baked by Mellisa and Hot & Crusty do a decent pizzas, sandwiches, and cakes as well. With the Metro station being located within a block of the hotel, it means you can travel anywhere in Manhattan for $3, Hell's Kitchen is the best area to find quality places to eat in New York, but avoid eating in or around Times Square.These days New York is a perfectly safe city, even Harlem, thanks to the army which is the NYPD. There are chancers knocking around, esp. in tourist spots like Times Square and Battery Park, but just walk with a sense of purpose and never show any weakness, and you'll be just fine.","Manchester, United Kingdom","Camouflagex</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Manchester, United Kingdom</strong>",18,5.0

But the rooms have been cleverly designed to pack a lot into a small space:Comfortable platform beds feature storage drawers, closets replaced by wall hooks, well-equipped bathrooms with fluffy towels, etc.For a short stay in NYC,It is a good choice if you're trying to save money. Location is terrific at 87th and Broadway, one block from the #1 Subway line and all Broadway buses. If you can get a room on the back of the building, you will have no view -- but will enjoy a pretty quiet night.

These rooms are small, probably starting at around 250 sq ft, with little space for hanging clothes. There are drawers in the closet and under the foot of the bed, and there's a safe. There is AC, which works very well, and surprisingly for an older building such as this, it's not a wall unit, it's central air/heat with an electronic thermostat. There a nice HD TV, but no radio or interface for a phone or Ipod (if anyone still has an Ipod). It's in a residential area on 87th St., so it's away from the Midtown energy. This may be a positive or negative depending on what one seeks in NYC. The 1 Train is a short block to the south, and will quickly get you to the Times Square/42nd St. stop, where you'll be in the middle of the action! For you runners out there, one lap around Central Park is 6.1 miles.Hotel is very clean, newly renovated, and the staff is very polite. Wi-fi is a bit slow, if that's important, but I'm an old bloke who doesn't really care about that one way or the other. The basic room may be cramped for two, but for a solo traveler it works fine. Many restaurants are close by, and again, if you want more, the subway is but a short walk away. It's also just a few blocks west of Central Park, and east of the Hudson, both with many great monuments.Tip: If flying thru JFK, use the Long Island Railroad to Penn Station, connecting to the 1 Train. LIRR is fast, reliable (this summer check their site, construction at Penn Station may severely impact schedules) and clean, and $7.25 off-peak to/from JFK with only one stop between. Subway is fun, but LIRR is more direct (18 minutes vs. 38 for Metro).Enjoy your summer, fellow travelers!","Los Angeles, CA","Nutria2008</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, CA</strong>",76,5.0

Suitcases go under the bed and clothes go in the cupboard without any real shelving...it's all a bit haphazard. Toilet and bathroom is small. So if you're staying any length of time you'd better get organised. I rolled up my jeans and put them on the window ledge...it served as a shelf. No coffee or tea making facilities.

The hotel is nicely situated near the subway and it's a wallk to the park. The staff were friendly but the rooms often didn't get done till after 3.00 which is rather late if you get back early and find the maid in the room.

Very close to Central Park and Broadway and very close to a Red Line subway station. There's a very wide choice of restaurants in the neighbourhood and it's also very quiet there.My main complaint with this hotel is the complete lack of sound isolation in the rooms. You hear everything in the corridor and even in other rooms as if they're happening in your own room. Also, the rooms are a bit small, especially for that price. But perhaps that's typical for NYC.

No room for even one dresser or a single chair--so you have to leave your luggage on the floor and sit on the bed (unless you want to stand). You do get 4 hangers, two for each ""hook"" that protrudes from near the mirror. The bathroom is not bad--but the soap provided is a joke--barely enough for one shower. The bed is very comfortable, the TV is fine, and the internet WiFi connection in the room is adequate--but I expect this of any hotel that I pay $250 a night for. I guess the price per night (I booked two rooms for 3 nights) is a pretty good deal for NYC, but I've stayed in much better hotels within a easy walking (4-5 block) radius for the same price or better.

We stayed (our third visit) for five nights in May, and our only quibble is with the wi-fi (you have to log in a new code each day, which was finicky.) The rooms are indeed small - they are well planned, however, and well - set up: ie, there are file drawer like cubbies under the bed, for example. In each of our stays, we've been in newly or recently renovated rooms and the bathrooms are tile or marble, and also highly functional. Housekeeping and front desk staff are genuinely enthusiastic about making the stay comfortable.For the price and the location, this is a very good alternative to the other more 'full service' hotels in the area - and for travelers interested in being in a more residential, cafe-chocked area instead of the bustle of Times Square, this is wonderful. There are two nearby subways - at Broadway and at Central Park West - and the area is safe, well populated by locals, and has the bonus of being near Central Park.No review of this hotel will NOT mention the size of the rooms - yes, they're small (we stayed once in a room with bunk beds here - it's real, it's a bargain and for one night in the city, perfectly servicable) - but if you have a room to put your luggage, sleep, shower, get ready to go and enjoy the city, this is a very suitable place. We have returned for our third time, finding the price and the location outweigh the modest challenge of a small room. For international visitors, this can be a GREAT base from which to effectively explore the city - a safe, bucolic (for NYC) area with great access to the rest of the city - including, for example, a 20-25 minute subway ride to Brooklyn, and 20 mins to Yankee Stadium, 20 mins to the museums in midtown and a beautiful walk to Central Park, to the Natural History Museum, the New-York HIstorical Society, etc. Great restaurants, too.","Boston, MA","MrMarkini</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, MA</strong>",22,4.0

(15"" between end of bed and wall) What needs to be stressed is it is a pleasant room...freshly painted white, fine bed and linens...even the towels are a notch above basic. Most appreciated were the two lights bedside so we could each read. The room seemed very european except for adequate lighting! There is a narrow table and a closet w/ a safe. The bathroom is small but was beautifully tiled. Plenty of hot water and good pressure. The hallways are not narrow and dingy...at least on the 5th floor they were freshly painted white w/ adequate lighting. The stairways are actually worth using. They are lovely. The hotel does offer discounted parking, but expect to be challenged to find it. We never did locate it until we located it on foot because the numbers do not seem to be displayed. (it is on 88th and is the garage immediately on the right after Broadway. I believe the address is 214 88th) There was a ""kitchen"" closet type room off the hallway.

It is clean and the staff is very pleasant when you can get ahold of them. However the Belnord facilities are limited in space and service is ""if you hit it right"". We are older and it was not right for us. Those stairs you see have to be climbed with suitcases, no ramp, no one at the door to assist those who need it. The halls are so narrow that one has to stop to let someone going in the opposite direction go by. The rooms are extremely small. You enter a double bed room and there is a bed taking up about 80% of the space. No chairs no desk. you literally have to hop on the bed to get out of the way of the other person. The bathroom is also barely turn-around space. The tub is half size. Although the bed is quite comfortable and you can find bedside tables and window sills to put your things, it is very cramped. We were in transition from living in NYC and moving to NH and needed a restful place to wind down after packing, etc. This was NOT a restful place and not a place for anyone who is uncomfortable in cramped quarters, and certainly not comfortable for older or physically disadvantaged people.It is good for people who will be spending almost the full day out and come here only to sleep, but little else.However there was one very upsetting policy issue. That is upon registering they request (demand) a $200 deposit for possible damages. When I was checking in, a young man, obviously from Europe, was questioning why he had to put down this $200 deposit and would he really get it returned to him at the end of his stay. Personally, I think that for the few people who may trash the room, (a very small percent, I am sure), the Belnord antagonizes those people who are respectful of property and will do no harm. It is insulting and, I think it sets a bad tone right up front about their stay at the hotel. Why should I trust you if you don't trust me? Bad policy.","Campton, New Hampshire","bernie1935</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Campton, New Hampshire</strong>",15,3.0

Big. Mistake.Upon arrival, all the negative reviews came to fruition - the wifi is painfully slow, verging on defunct. The room is SO small, you can barely make it around the bed and opening & closing the bathroom door was tricky to say the least because of it's proximity to the toilet. God help any guests who are pregnant or generously built. The walls are paper thin as is the door which means you can hear EVERYTHING and so can everyone else - which made it difficult to relax. When we went to bed, inevitably we were kept awake most of the night by a neighbouring guest who came in drunk, swearing and then proceeded to have several telephone conversations and watch TV into the early hours (this was in the room opposite and we heard EVERYTHING!). We reported the noise to the front desk who did absolutely nothing about it.The other 'feature' of this hotel was the loud humming of some kind of generator. It would come on and off throughout the night and when it did come on, it made the bed buzz and vibrate under our heads, which made it feel like we were sleeping on top of an engine.Suffice to say, we got zero sleep and so our first day in NYC was not good as we were exhausted after travelling from the UK. Knowing that moving to another room would make no difference, we made the financially painful decision to move to another hotel as we knew we could not physically sleep there and having spent a lot of money to get to NYC we weren't going to walk around like zombies the whole time because we couldn't sleep.We explained politely to the front desk that we were checking out early and why, and the guy didn't seem at all surprised about the complaints we had. We asked if they could refund us anything at all for the following 2 nights we had booked, under the circumstances and he said no. We weren't surprised but it was disappointing.We moved to Candlewood Suites near to Times Square and it was fantastic - highly recommended and best of all, we slept soundly the next two nights.Conclusion: don't waste your money on this place, it might be cheap but you'd get more privacy, space and sleep quality in a cardboard box.",,Karen S,8,1.0

At least my ""room"" and super mini bathroom were always clean. 2- Its location is nice, you can walk for around 20-30 minutes or you can just take the subway very close to it.The reasons why I was not happy were that first the pictures are sort of deceiving. Again I know it's a budget hotel, blah blah; however, the rooms are way smaller than they even seem. There's just some space for the doble bed, a nightstand and to try to walk around next to the bed. Now the bed. The mattress must be super old because even if you sit down, it makes a lot of noise. I felt bad about even changing sides on the bed in the middle of the night because I didn't want anyone wake up in the next 10 rooms around. Why? well the ""rooms"" are super small and walls are thin, ultra thin, so you can even hear the phone conversation that a person across your room is having.People were ok, neither friendly nor unfriendly. They don't seem to mind your being or not being there. I guess that one of the things that bothers me in general is the fact that it is called a hotel when it is much more like a hostel. I would honestly suggest you try and pay a little extra if you can and stay in a nicer place.PS. You have to deposit 200 dollars, much more than in a Hard Rock hotel or in actual hotels. For some reason someone could destroy their noise uncomfortable mattresses.","Bogota, Colombia","762ronaldg</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Bogota, Colombia</strong>",11,2.0

Two twin beds took up almost all the floorspace in the room. The bathroom was also very small but well-designed. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean. These accommodations were fine for two average-size adults, but I think anyone trending larger (more than 6 feet tall, or more than about 180 pounds?) might be uncomfortable in the small space. The desk staff was friendly but a bit slow-moving and inefficient. The hotel offered a luggage room for storage before and after checkout, which is very convenient. However, it's also the reason I didn't give 5 stars. When I arrived to drop off my luggage, the desk clerk didn't even ask my name or ask if I had a reservation...I could have been anyone off the street! So I was somewhat concerned that they were indiscriminately allowing anyone who showed up access to the room. And the storage room itself reeked of urine.

Whilst the wi-fi took some messing to connect, plus the annoying changing of the password every day, once connected the wi-fi was very good.As in earlier reviews, the hotel is in an excellent place set within a residential area. Central Park is a 10 minute walk away and the nearest subway is literally around the corner 3 minutes walk away.The hotel is just around the corner from Broadway on the upper west side where you can find many places to eat all kinds of meals, even 24 hour diners, shops, supermarkets and a few pubs. We liked the ""parlour"" Irish bar just around the corner on 86 street and also the ""hot and crusty"" breakfast deli, which was excellent. Not Starbucks, but why come to New York to go to such sterile cafes? Experience the local Fayre!!!Bloomingdales are opening an outlet this weekend and this is a 15 minute walk down Broadway.So in a nutshell, yes rooms are very small but reviews should be based on the accommodation as advertised and no way does this hotel purport to be a 5 star establishment. We stay in 5 star resorts for our main holiday each year but this hotel totally hit the spot with us. We thought ON THE WHOLE it was excellent, well placed and great value for money.Can also recommend the ""go"" airport shuttle, contact details in the photo, and at 21 dollars per person, this was a great way to go back to Newark airport and half the price of a yellow cab. The driver was a really nice guy!Other recommendations were the 9/11 national memorial which was very moving and very well done. Favourite up high experience was top of the rock because whilst Empire State Building was good, the rock looks at the ESB so you also get great views of that. Do these at day and night.Glad we did one World Trade CenterAnd went to the top but whilst it's high, and unique, we felt like they just wanted to sell you more and more and it spoiled it. ESB try and sell you photos etc but at least the staff are really nice.....Final recommendation is the New York City pass (the red and black one).

I called Expedia, they said they'd call Belnord to amend, unfortunately I was cut off before the end of the call (ran out of coins at a Peruvian pay phone at the airport). After arriving at New York the next morning I went to the hotel expecting that Expedia had solved the problem - the staff at Belnord were unhelpful and fairly rude. They asked why I'd gone to the hotel and why hadn't I called from the airport (try finding a pay phone in JFK that works, I didn't have access to a US mobile phone). They said I should call Expedia again - but refused to let me use the phone in their lobby, and said there's a pay phone around the block that I could use. I did that - while I called Expedia again, my wife remained in the lobby at Belnord and heard their side of the call when the Expedia rep called them again. Mario from Belnord hotel told the Expedia rep ""it's their problem"", and refused to amend or refund the booking. When I went back to the hotel he told me that the hotel will only amend a booking ""if someone dies"". He said I'd need to call Expedia again the next day at 8am, and get them to speak to his boss (Armando).It was clear that the Belnord staff had no intention of helping, and couldn't care less that I didn't have a room for the night, and would probably waste $180 on a booking that I couldn't even use. After that I left the hotel and found a Starbucks a few blocks away to search for another hotel. The next morning I called Expedia again at 8am. Their rep tried to speak to Armando, but was put to voicemail. I raised a complaint with Expedia, they said they'd make it a ""supervisor level query"", and that a supervisor would try again to speak to Armando. Nothing came of this. I had a lengthy conversation with the Expedia rep, he confirmed (looking at notes on their system) that an Expedia rep had spoken to Belnord Hotel when I called from Peru - they'd refused to amend the booking date, even though they had a room available at the time. The booking was a waste of time and money. My trip to New York started on a very sour note thanks to the unhelpful staff at Belnord, and Expedia. My booking was clearly in error, two weeks earlier than needed. Probably something went wrong with the browser or website, when I first tried to pay the Expedia website stated that the fee had changed by 10 cents - second time I tried to pay it changed another 10 cents. Third time the payment went through, I guess that somewhere in that process the booking date reverted to the website default (two weeks in the future) and things went wrong.

When the charge appeared on my credit card, I called The Belnord and was told this pending charge was a mistake and would be removed prior to posting. I then also canceled my reservation at The Belnord as a result of their card charge mistake. The charge remained on my card as pending, then went through as an actual charge two days after the cancellation. When The Belnord was informed that the charge was now no longer pending and an actual charge to my card, they agreed to refund within 5-10 days. The charge should have never been pending let alone actual based on the terms of the reservation, and the 5-10 day wait period for the credit is unacceptable-24 hours is acceptable. Appears The Belnord is managing cash float on guest reservation charges.

The WiFi worked well (but the password changes every night at midnight so be sure they give you a full set).The lower bunk was fine. The upper bunk was not so good because it was close to the ventilator and the temperature varies as the fan cycles. There is a little gooseneck LED reading lamp in each bunk, but none of them worked on either visit.

The room we had was very tiny that only bed was able to fit in but nicely refurbished and we also had nice private bathroom with a good size and excellent quality of egyptian towels etc.. The room was very clean I did not really find any dirt but only wondered if duvets are washed too as we only had plain duvet with a sheet under the duvet ( not a cover) I hope that duvets are washable too as I cant imagine to sleep under the unwashed duvet!! The bed was excellent but did not like the shelves under the bed as due to the size of the room we stumbled over the bed all the time and ended up with some injuries. The floor we stayed in also had a small kitchen with shelves, fridge, sink and also filter water boiler with paper cups etc. - which was a great bonus! The hotel is also offering budget rooms with shared bathroom or I think there also update for bigger rooms. The staff was very nice and fun and always willing to help. Wifi was ok.

The queen-sized bed had clearance of about 1.5 ft along 2 sides of the bed while the the 3rd accessible wall, had enough room to comfortably move around and access the small well-appointed washroom. There was virtually no room to store clothing on any shelves.

The room was clean, current and well-maintained.There is a small business room (2 PCs and printer) to access the Internet or work on documents. I asked them if I could create a boarding pass when needed. The service was available but for a fee. This should be complimentary. I printed it elsewhere. A nice feature in the lobby was an electronic display of arrivals and departures from the airports. Very nice.One final note. This is a micro-hotel in a great area near the subway, great restaurants, shopping, etc. The maid service was very efficient amd pleasant.

If you call them directly to book, the staff is so busy that they'll tell you to do this anyway.I used to live in New York and the location is superb. In an ironic way, hotels like these are for the truly sophisticated traveler who would rather spend their money on fine meals, museums, or shopping. As far as the rates go, pretty steep for what you get (if traveling alone.) If there are two of you, then it works out better--about $100 bucks or so each.Good luck and enjoy your stay in New York!

The hotel has parking available with a discount that they give you that's the next street over (not far at all) but we did parking though SpotHero instead, which was in the same lot on 88th street and was $10 cheaper. So if you like cheap, then I would suggest downloading that free app. Once you step out of your hotel Central Park is to the left and to the right is Broadway which takes you to the subway, literally a 2 min walk away right on 86th street, the 1 takes you straight downtown. Also, we requested a handicap room because we seen reviews that said the rooms were terribly small, so please ""Request a Handicap Room"" they will let you do so. Just check and make sure your room is still available a couple days before you check in. The only negative was there was no fridge or a microwave, but they had a ice machine in the basement.

Rooms are, indeed, small, but in my opinion that's not so relevant, considering that it's a budget hotel and NY is a city for you to spend all day out (and night, too, if you want to). If you're looking for a decent place to sleep, the hotel is a good option, especially if you see reviews of other budget hotels in Manhattan, which are ridiculously overpriced and sometimes not exactly clean. This is not Orlando; this is New York City. Don't expect huge rooms with cheap rates in NYC. You just won't find them in Manhattan, and if you see anything like that, you'll see that reviews usually mention bed bugs -- not my experience with the Belnord. Rooms were very clean and, although walls are thin, I couldn't hear anything from other rooms, just people walking outside, mostly during the day -- but that wasn't a real problem for me. From my personal experience, I thought this wasn't a real problem.Beds are just OK. One good thing about this hotel is that you can book rooms with two single beds - something not so common in the US. As I was staying with my brother, I found this to be good. The Upper West Side is a very pleasant area in NYC. It's not as busy as other parts of the city and people are much more polite on the streets (no stressed walking fast and angry at people who can't keep that pace). It's the ideal location for a family stay. Moreover, the 86th St. subway station is just next door -- that was really good!I must mention that Daniel, who works at the lobby, was really nice and gave some nice tips to my parents, who were staying in another room. The other receptionists need to improve their facial expressions (a.k.a. smile) and really incorporate the American way of rendering a service (nice approach, ""how are you"", ""good morning"", etc), which is one of the key elements that attract visitors to the United States. Other than Daniel, most of the other ones wouldn't answer my ""good morning"" or ""good evening"" phrases -- that was something that bothered me a little.","Rio de Janeiro, RJ","JohnFromBrazil</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Rio de Janeiro, RJ</strong>",41,4.0

We knew we wanted to stay on the Upper West Side from prior visits to New York, but wanted to try a different hotel from our last one there. Separated only by several blocks, this hotel was comparable to the last one we stayed at in terms of location. When comparing cost, however, this hotel was considerably less and just as convenient in location and value. Our double bed room here was very, very small - just enough room to move around the bed and desk. We had seen on other reviews that this was the case, and it certainly was. The bathroom was adequate but the toilet made weird noises after every flush. Our bed was comfortable with several pillows and the bedding was clean. There were extra blankets and pillows in the tiny, tiny closet, which was nice. Towels were replaced faithfully, which was very nice. We had control over the heat for our room, which was great. Our view was a back wall of a neighboring building, but that was fine. We believe you really need to like the person you're rooming with here, though, because you are going to be in *very* close quarters for the duration of your stay. The staff was friendly and polite. The internet worked fine but you had to log in everyday with a new password the staff can provide shortly after midnight every night. The staff arranged a car for us to take us to the airport on very short notice when our flight was unexpectedly moved up to an earlier time - the cost for the car was a flat $50 rate to LaGuardia, but well worth it.The Belnord is *very* conveniently located to Central Park and several very good restaurants and coffee shops in the area. We recommend the Cafe on Broadway and 5-Napkin Burger (both about 2 blocks down on Broadway) as well as Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf (there are 2 fairly close by) and the Ocean Grille (about 8 blocks down on Columbus). The subway stop is one block over on Broadway from the hotel and well lit for nighttime travel back to the hotel. If you need a truly cost-effective room to sleep and shower in at the end of everyday in the city that is also conveniently located to good food and transportation, the Belnord is great. If you plan to hang out in your room a lot, you might want to think twice about this really great and comfortable hotel.

I will say that it is spotless and cozy. The bed is comfortable and inviting with 5 pillows. It is only as quiet as what is happening outside your door. I promised Manuel, the kind and helpful caretaker, that I would put in a nice word for him. In fact, it is because of his kindness that I chose to stay another night. It was one of the worst nights of my life. The thing with this hotel is this: NONE of the tvs work, and NO one knows how to fix them. Manuel spent an hour the first night, and finally suggested I change rooms. He told me about the nice coffee machine, also broken. At about 1 in the morning, the toilet started running nonstop. AND YET, as a traveler to many countries, I have learned that the kindness of the staff can cancel out a lot of headaches. BUT, I am a woman traveling alone, and looking for an apartment in Manhattan is stressful. The next morning, I told Jonathan about the issues, left my bag in the storage room, and said I might stay another night.I was in fact TOO tired to take the bus home, a journey of one and one half hours. I decided to treat myself to a night of TV and another night in the city. BEFORE booking the room, I made sure I could get the same room. I called and was told they would save the room for me. When I got to the hotel it was no longer available. I took a different room. I got into bed right away, and tried the TV. BROKEN. They sent another man, who stayed one hour coming and going while I tried to talk on the phone. End result- O. I Was too tired to move rooms and I resented the lack of privacy. I slept for about 3 hours to a loud humming noise which WOULD NOT go away. I tried ear plugs called the desk. A very nice guy Daniel, said he would send someone to look at it. A man came up, asked if he could do something. I had been up almost three hours with no TV to at least distract me. I told him I'd love a cup of tea. FOUND out the beverage machine was :Broken! I just felt so miserable at this point I almost walked to the all night cafe. Except I realized I had a fever. Daniel at the desk agreed I was entitled to compensation. He said to speak to Jonathan, whom I knew to be hardworking and nice.As LONGas you Don't complain The next morning he said he could not refund the night EVEN though I ONLY STAYED based on the fact I be given the same room.

The hotel is cheap (by Manhattan standards), very clean and in a great Upper West Side location (assuming you want to be on the Upper West Side). It is an easy, half block walk to the 1 Line and is within walking distance of groceries, coffee shops, etc. If you are traveling for pleasure and do not plan on spending much time in your hotel room, these may be the key factors for you and you will not be disappointed. However, the rooms are very, very small. Even for Manhattan. The room I had was literally about 10 feet by 10 feet, excluding the bathroom. It had room for a bed and the TV, which was hung on the wall. There were two night stands, one of which held the phone. That was it. There was almost no room to turn around,. There was no room for a chair to sit in, much less a desk. Unfortunately, I was in Manhattan on business and needed to spend a considerable amount of time in the room working. This just wasn't possible. So, I sought out a coffee shop, took my computer and my iPhone and set up a hot spot using the phone. This way I was able to log onto the internet. But I couldn't make private business phone calls in a public space like this. So, the coffee shop as a work space didn't really work for me. Just to be clear, the hotel does have wireless internet, which is included in the price, but trying to lie on the bed (remember, there is no place to sit in the room), type and conduct business just wasn't possible for me. Also, while not a big deal, the wireless internet is very slow. You can't really use it to stream video. It sort of works, but not very well. It's fine, though, for e-mail.So, I gave the hotel 3 stars.

We booked our room on travelocity and despite showing the front desk attendant our reservation confirmation, he refused to honor it because he could not find it in his computer, stating that Travelocity did not enter it into the system, which he said has happened before several times. Rather than contacting Travelocity himself to resolve the issue, he told us to contact Travelocity and forced us to sit in the lobby for the next hour at midnight. Travelocity stated they they sent him info, which he says had not been received and continued to argue with us about what Travelocity should be doing, prompting him to force us to call Travelocity a second time. It was only when we became insistent that he resolve the dispute directly with Travelocity that he finally called them, and then proceeded to talk down to the person on the phone and not believe them either that the reservation was real (despite them giving obvious details on the phone of our reservation) and demanded to know their names and how to contact them should it be false so he can track them down and hold them accountable. While sitting in the lobby for an hour we got to witness the same staff being rude, abrupt, and unclear to multiple people that came to check in, mostly because they handed over debit instead of credit cards to put a hold on the room, which meant that the Hotel would put a $200 hold on the debit cards...this is a fairly easy explanation, but he managed to make it into a semi-hostile and confusing encounter with many guests. In the end, when we were finally allowed to check into the room at 12:30 am, he apologized, but we were pretty frustrated by that point.The room: Oy, other reviewers are not exaggerating when they say how small the room is. It actually made me laugh multiple times whenever we would try to maneuver through the room because it was so small that you could almost touch all four side with your arms and legs outstretched, almost...if you were a basketball player, you totally would. It was a modern feat in architecture really to be able to design a usable space that small that was not a prison cell. I don't think a TV would have fit in the room if they did not have the modern wall mounted kind. The beds are very hard and the blankets are rough and uncomfortable. The temperature of the room could not be adjusted to a comfortable level, despite having an adjustment box available.The pros: it was clean, the price was great for NYC, and the location was perfect, just a little ways from Central Park.

I called to find out about the cancellation policy. The reservation I signed up for said I had to cancel about 48 hours ahead. I thought this might be a special circumstance (the other hotel I was scheduled to stay at said I could cancel up to the day of check in if my flights were cancelled). Anyway, I had no way of knowing whether my flight would be going (could have cancelled more than 24 hours ahead if they'd allowed), but they told me I'd be charged for one night ($272.00 which is really expensive for me to pay for one night to begin with) if I cancelled on Nov.1 (for my Nov. 2 reservation). It seemed to me they might have appreciated some cancellations so that they could help out local NYC residents who were displaced by the storm. Instead, they made me feel compelled to make the trip rather than lose my money! They also had no place to lock anything up for my and no safe in the room. They did not allow any fluctuation in check-in, check-out time.

The room was exceptionally clean and large enough for two people, had a closet, two bedside tables, a desk and chair, a luggage rack, room for a couple of suitcases, two large windows, and a very very small bathroom. There were outlets next to the bed and under the desk for charging cells and computers. The bathroom had a wall hair dryer, shampoo, soaps, and plastic cups - unfortunately the cups were never replaced in the three days I stayed there. There were no hooks in the bathroom which made it impossible to hang a robe or pjs. The towels were soft and large. There is a fan in the bathroom. Good shower - tall shower head. In room heating/AC digital electronics worked great. Love the carpet-less floors except late at night and early in the morning when the hall traffic is LOUD.

The only thing I didn´t like is that we need to take a taxi to the airport, they don´t get yellow cabs, and the cost is US$60.00 and tip (optional). It is like a line of taxis for executives, but when we got to the airport, the driver asked us for US$65.00 and a obligatory amount of tip....So, if you need to go to Manhattan, looking for a room to sleep, this is it...because it´s cheaper than the hotels in Manhattan..The people in the front desk are not very nice, though...",español en ca,"tusita</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>español en ca</strong>",40,4.0

We stayed there in August/September of 2012, for 8 nights and paid an average of $216 per night including taxes (booked through Expedia). This was a Belnord different to many previous reviews. In fact, most of it looked as if had recently been refurbished. It did have an elevator. It had wooden floors. It had an adequate reception area. The room we were given was small, but not too small, apparently one of the largest they have: not enough space to hang clothes or put them in a wardrobe, so we had to live out of our suitcases. Partitions were made of some sort of plywood so that every word spoken outside was well audible inside. But it had a 26 inch TV set (HD, as all are now in the US) with the Time-Warner set of channels. These do not carry a single foreign language (Spanish can no longer be considered a FOREIGN language in New York, like in many other US locations), so that some of the other guests we spoke to were disappointed. It also was so superclean that we had to abandon all thoughts of how to avoid bedbugs, thoughtfully provided to us by Yahoo Travel. All bedclothes and utilities were changed every day, which led to an experience unheard of in the more than a hundred hotels that I have visited over the years: I put my undercover billfold (flat and plastic) in the pillowcase, as I am used to in my travels. But I forgot it there… In the evening I was sure that I had lost the several hundred dollars of spending money that I had put there. But the next morning the reception clerk to whom appealed called the head of the maids, and when my wife produced its exact twin the lady handed my billfold over. All the money was there, although it had gone to the laundry and made its way back from there washed. Needless to say – we were overjoyed. As for the rest – the Upper West Side is a pleasant and safe part of the city and has many attractive shops. Bus lines and the Underground are a stone's throw away from the hotel. The staff are friendly and helpful. The rate was far lower that that of other hotels in New York, especially since we could not book far in advance. Places to eat are nearby – three in the same bloc. And the other guests, who spoke a Babel of languages, were all quiet-spoken and courteous, meaning there was no noise to complain about at all. Definitely value for money.

When we looked at the fire escape plan beside the lift it did seem like we literally got the smallest room on the floor - there was barely enough space to walk around the bed, none if you decided to put your luggage down, so it did require extreme tidyness or you'd be tripping over yourself. That said, it was fully formed in that it had a double bed, 2 bedside lockers, En Suite, TV and a small wardrobe in it.Overall a good experience that I would recommend.

I am new to Trip Advisor hence my late review. Having read the reviews I was a little apprehensive about staying. I travelled from the UK on my own so I wanted everything to run smoothly. Check in was very easy. I was in my room within minutes.I found my room to be small but for me it was fine. I had enough room to put my suitcase on the floor and still walk around. There was a desk for my laptop and a decent sized flat screen tv. The room was spotless and so was the bathroom, which had a modern decor. The bed in the room was also comfortable. As I was in NYC I hardly spent any time in my room, there is no need to in a city like this. There were no amenities at the hotel (that i was aware off) but the hotel served it's purpose. The staff were helpful and most of them were friendly. As I said i was only there to sleep so i didn't really deal with the staff much. The hotel is in an amazing location. I wanted to stay on the Upper West Side to get away from the hustle and noise of the city. It was quiet and peaceful and was in easy access to many great bars and restaurants. I spent hours walking around this neighbourhood. From what I seen the subway / underground was only around the corner but I am a walker so i went everywhere on foot. I would stay here again providing I got a good deal on rates. It wasn't until after I booked the hotel that I noticed better hotels with similar rates.","Corby, Northamptonshire","Allen T</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Corby, Northamptonshire</strong>",31,3.0

Yes, the rooms are tiny; yes, the amenities are limited, but it's not a hostel, it's not the YMCA or camping or bunking on somebody's couch. It's a safe, immaculately clean, reasonably modern and superbly located hotel. For the money, I consider it a prize. The staff varied from very friendly (particularly a young man named Daniel) to unsmiling, but civil. And no wonder the facilities are spotless. House-cleaning staff seemed to be everywhere, dusting and polishing surfaces to a high gleam. Here are the specific issues that I would love to see Belnord management address: 1. Make it easier for guests to get luggage up the front steps. 2. Reward staff that excels in friendly customer service with bonuses so that everyone else will follow suit. 3. Update the media room so that guests can either use the printer free of charge or streamline the entire process. I tried to print my boarding passes and encountered all sorts of problems with the hotel's pay-by-the-minute system. The culprit was slow computer speed that ate up my prepaid minutes before I could print. The front-desk man offered to put in for reimbursement, but it sounded like a hassle, so I followed his recommendation and went up Broadway a few blocks to a copier store. This was my unhappiest moment at Belnord. Everything else was peachy keen--for the money.","Northport, Alabama","Lila W</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Northport, Alabama</strong>",0,4.0

Location-wise, it’s perfect because the neighborhood is safe and the hotel is located in the central area within the Upper West Side neighborhood. Busses and subways are readily near. The hotel lobby is small but cozy with a receptionist handling all our booking and other requests.Our check-in was fuzz-free. All it took was the receptionist getting our information and handling us the key and within minutes, we were dragging our luggage up to our room. There weren’t bellboys to aid us with our luggage but that was fine, as our rooms were very near the lift so it wasn’t an issue.Upon entering, I was a little taken aback by the size of the room. It was tiny, with three quarter of the room being taken up by the two single beds. However, it was very clean. Basic amenities such as clean towels, clean bedding, proper working shower system and toilet bowl, hairdryer, shampoo and soap, clean rolls of toilet papers and a working television were available. In fact, all these were more than enough for a night’s stay. There was even a dressing table and a huge mirror. The toilet was pretty big considering the size of the room. No bathtub, but a good and working standing shower and most of all the toilet was clean and reek-free!I highly recommend budget-travelers to consider the Belnord Hotel if you’re looking for accommodation in Manhattan or the Upper West Side because the surrounding is very safe and quiet as it's mainly residential areas. There are also plenty of fast food locations, convenient stores and casual eateries all around which are really good since the hotel itself doesn’t provide dining services.","Singapore, Singapore","Yeeling C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Singapore, Singapore</strong>",2,4.0

The Belnord Hotel is located within walking distance from Central Park and Columbia University. It is a short cab ride (20 blocks) from Times Square. My friend and I were given a handicap accessible room which we did not request but we did appreciate. It was large enough for the both of us and the bathroom was large. The bathroom amenities are average. There is no iron in the room.On the other hand, the customer service at this hotel is the worst I've ever experienced. First of all, not one of the 4 employees I encountered during my 5 day stay had a grasp of the English language. Unless you speak Spanish, which I do, you will have a hard time communicating, especially with housekeeping. I was meeting a friend in NYC and she was flying in internationally. I called the hotel to leave her a message advising of my flight delay. A message was taken begrudgingly by Jonathan. When I called a second time to inform of a further flight delay, Jonathan yelled, ""I already gave your friend the message!"" Come to find out, he relayed my message to my friend only when she walked up and asked if she could check in (the reservation was in my name.) He told her she could not check in because the reservation was not in her name but when she insisted he allowed her to check in. The fact that security or compliance are not main concerns at this hotel is worrisome but nothing unusual happened during our stay. I never checked into the hotel. My friend was able to obtain 2 room keys and I paid for my portion of our stay without ever having to give my name or formally check in. Housekeeping starts early at this hotel so if you are not an early riser, place the Do Not Disturb sign on the doorknob. Free Wi-Fi is offered. You must obtain a code from the front desk each day that you wish to use it. I was only able to use it for 30 minutes during my 5 day stay. When I called the front desk they told me to call tech support who was very helpful and polite but it seemed the issue was with the connection at the hotel which tech support could not resolve. The phones in the room are to call the front desk ONLY!

They are also very clean. I will give them that.There is a station which shows XXX content on it in each room. Id suggest parents with kids be careful about this. I cant remember the channel name, sorry. There is free wi-fi in the room, which is good. However, sometimes it's fast and sometimes it's very slow. There are public 3 computers and 1 printer available to use for a small fee. Also, my mobile phone and no signal in my room. I was on the first floor so maybe thats it? It was aggravating whatever the reason. The bed wasnt very soft, quite firm in my opinion. So, depending on how you like your bed to be, this can be good or bad. The AC/heat in the room was VERY, VERY loud. I couldnt turn it on at night to sleep. Therefore, when I woke up it was cold in my room.One of the worst things about this place is the shower. It gets very cold all of a sudden....then you get scalded. I like a good, warm shower that stays warm for 10 mins or less. This was AWFUL. The walls are very thin, so if you're a light sleeper like I am. BEWARE. I couldnt sleep well at night. A poor nights sleep really wears on you when you're running all around the city.The staff are unfriendly and act like they'd prefer if you werent there. My bathroom had a leak dropping from the overhead vent. It soaked the floor. I went to the front desk to ask if I could change my room. He acted like it made him angry to have to deal with this. He said he'd send someone to fix it. Why couldnt I just get a different room with a dry floor? The guy came, said ""It's because the people above you were taking a shower. It will stop in 5 mins. Keep the towels on the floor and where it's dropping."" He gave me clean towels and left. It did stop dripping but the floor remained wet 'til I checked out the next day. This is HORRIBLE customer service regardless if you're a budget hotel or not. I'd suggest that you spend $50.00 more a night and actually have an enjoyable place to stay.

I requested extra towels, and they were delivered right away, white, fluffy , new, and warm just out of a dryer, imagine that as well! I must say the Spanish maids were VERY noisey in the early mornings in the hallways. Yelling to each other while cleaning the rooms. I complained about that and they switched the attendant to Spanish men who were very professional and gracious. ( I think those guys understood what I meant :) I do tend to need a bigger space in the room, so I have moved on from the Belnord, but I was pleasantly surprised, and felt that I was staying in someones historical home, that they preserved and cared for in an updated and professional way. It again did not have the feeling of a flashback to a museum of dust and darkness, you can tell right away, this had been upgrading to the current times. I admired that.

However the room was clean and the bathroom seemed to be newly renovated and very pretty. There is free wi-fi. We spent very little time in the room as we were out at night until 5AM. In the morning, there is quite a bit of noise - the walls are paper-thin so you can hear things like maids knocking on doors, people leaving their rooms, phones ringing off the hook .. don't expect to get a good sleep if you don't go to sleep early. However it was quiet enough at night. Next morning, we had access to a luggage room for free when we checked out but didn't want to lug our bags around while sightseeing.Seriously - for about $170 on a Friday night in Manhattan, a hotel that's in a quiet neighborhood a block away from a subway station (86st on the 1 line) is a done deal.

Loud aircon, cleaning staff banging around early in the morning, phones constantly ringing in the corridors, neighbours having sex... this place had it all.- Facilities - The shower had a mind of its own and the internet was a pain to use and slowwwww during peak times.All in all, if I could do it again, I'd just go mega cheap and stay at a backpackers or something similar, or cough up an extra $50-$100 a night and stay in a better hotel.

I stayed in 3 separate rooms over 2 weeks (after taking trips to Chicago and Washington DC during my stay) and all are tiny; the rooms I had one double bed, one beside table and a few poles to hang your clothes on. (One had a tiny toilet instead.) The room is big enough to put the double bed with about 1.5 feet to spare on either side of the bed.(b) The counter staff are incompetent and very rude. They lost our reservation for the second leg of the trip and were patronising, unhelpful and contemptuous. They would claim that 'your reservation is not on the system' and repeatedly ask, ""What website did you book it on?"", and when we couldn't immediately remember they repeated themselves as though we were slow 3-year-olds. This is a service industry, but they don't recognise that or choose not to bother.(c) Interestingly, every 2 or 3 times we passed the counter in the lobby, we'd see a disgruntled customer discovering that his/ her deposit had been conveniently lost by the hotel. Word to the wise: document every single transaction you have with this hotel, or you're going to see your money magically disappear.(d) For the last 4 days of our stay in NYC, we stayed on the 4th floor, and the lift lobby on the 4th floor smelled as though someone had urinated in it, and the smell got progressively worse and had not been dealt with on the day we checked out.

Central Park is also only a few blocks away.The room was tiny. seriously tiny. But very clean. When I opened the door to my room I was standing right in front of my bed... that's basically what the room consisted of, the bed, a tv and a nightstand... To the left of the bed there was just about enough space to fit my suitcase between it and the wall and open the door, on the right side there was hardly any space between bed and window... at the foot of the bed was the door to the bathroom and the flatscreen on the wall... Again, there was just enough space between the bed and bathroom to open the door... The bathroom was also small but very very clean which is a big plus in my books...Next to the bathroom door was also a smll closet to hang jackets and stuff. What I also liked it that the room had wood floors instead of carpeting which also gave it a more clean feeling.The staff of the hotel was very nice even though I must've annoyed them to no end since my laptop kept kicking me out of the internet (which was complimentary) and I went don to the reception desk 6 or 7 times to request a new code. Downside of the tiny rooms is that you actually sleep right next to the walls and doors which means you actually wake up as soon as housekeeping starts their work... I was regularly woen by the sound of dirty towels and stuff being thrown into plastic bags.Overall I can reccommend this hotel though. it's perfect for short trips on a budget since everything is close by and the subway gets you everywhere.If you're not travelling alone it could get seriously crowded though... but definitely perfect for the single traveller who doesn't seek more than a clean room and a comfy bed.","Gelsenkirchen, Germany","EndlessFighter</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gelsenkirchen, Germany</strong>",10,3.0

They have a locked room downstairs for storing luggage...and that worked out wellSo the suite cost about an extra 50 bucks or so, but it was worth it. Total for the room with tax was $226.

The decor was nice and simple and I must say the bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds i have ever slept in! I think it was new.So great for a buget hotel. But my main gripe was the staff on reception, most of them where fine but one in particular was extremely rude and even turned round and told us too ""phone yourself"" when i asked her to call an excursion company about booking a tour! we tried but had no luck and had to work out the pay phone, eventually another guy came on reception and we asked him and he was fine. So expect to fend for your self and have to ask a few times at the least if you want any help! Also the air conditioning was rather noisy even when off so if your a light sleeper i'd take some ear plugs.Apart from my last 2 comments i would recommend this hotel if you want to do New York on a budget.

And most importantly, if you're planning to do some sightseeing and shopping in Manhattan, the location is very inconvienient for getting around/dipping in to your hotel for a rest or to drop things off between outings.All in all, the price was excellant so if you really do just want a place to sleep and you dont mind being farher away from attractions, its worth the price and they have free wireless in all rooms.

The Belnord Hotel lived up to expectations. For the money, it was the best deal we have found in Manhattan. The rooms were clean and quiet and the location was safe. For the money we were not expecting a large room. Having visited Manhattan several times from Phoenix we know the amount you pay seems to proportionate to the room size. Therefore, for a nightly fee of less than $100 we knew the room would be small.

But the first room we were given wasn't clean. I mean it REALLY wasn't clean. It had somebody else's garbage in it!!i complained about this and was given a new room immediately, which was clean.on our second night there, the electricity went out at 7 a.m. this killed the a/c and made it almost immediately 85 degrees in the room. the phone wasn't working either. when i went downstairs to complain, 100 firemen were outside. there was a fire in the electrical room. maybe you can fault the hotel for doing something wrong that contributed to the fire, or that contributed to its not being discovered early enough, i can't say. but the lack of electricity for that day, and the elevator that was broken for the next four days, was not something they compensated anyone for. everything went relatively smoothly for the rest of our stay (except for having to run up and down four flights of stairs).","los angeles, ca","chrislarkin</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>los angeles, ca</strong>",0,3.0

YES there is an elevatorBottom Line: You are paying next to nothing (I paid $75+tax per night) for a room that is perfectly clean and nice. The ONLY reason that it is SO cheap is that it is incredibly, unbelievably and a little bit laughably small. I knew it was going to be small for the price, and my husband and I did laugh a little when we opened the door but in good spirits. If you can handle the smallness, your needs will be met. I hate to say this, but if you are a person of large stature, you may be too uncomfortable in this hotel. I have to laugh at the people who complain about their ""view"" being a ""brick wall"". HELLO - you are in New York City where all of the buildings are lined up wall to wall down every street. Were they expecting that every room in the circumference of the hotel faces across the street? Or worse, were they hoping for a 10th story balcony and a view of central park for $75? Please, don't go to a bargain hotel expecting free breakfast, a Ritz Carleton sized room, a glitzy view and free parking. I actually felt like a real New Yorker with my view of that other brick building because there was a pigeon sitting on the sill and it was unique.This place made it possible for us to go to NYC for the weekend.

Everything was brand new and spotless and I cannot say enough good things about the experience. The decor was fashionable. The beds were comfy, the linens were fresh and clean. The towels were thick and fluffy. The bathroom was brand new with beautiful tile, a pedestal sink and a good sized shower. The toiletries were basic- no name soap and no name shampoo. A flat screen television is mounted to the wall. WiFi is free with a code from the front desk.The building is located on a quiet side street in a very safe area with tons of shops and restaurants within walking distance. We could have easily spent the weekend hanging out in the neighborhood. It's a short walk to Central Park on one side, and Riverside Park on the other. The subway ( 1 2 3) is a block away. It was an easy walk to the Museum of Natural History.The rooms are small - there was not much room for anything besides the beds, a nightstand and a little alcove with a closet. There was no chair, and not really room for one. There is no tub in the bathroom, only a shower. But we did not find the room cramped. I have stayed in more expensive NY hotels that were about the same size but not nearly as nice.We were originally in Rm 501, right across from the elevator with a very loud bell. I asked to be moved because of the noise, the pleasant staff immediately changed the room. Room 501 did not have a closet, only a small dresser. It did have a writing desk, but seemed smaller than the room we ended up in (514). Although I read of complaints of noise from the renovations we did not have that problem, no jack hammers, no noisy neighbors. We were completely stunned by how nice the room was, the cheap price, and the amazing location.

We had to drag our bags up three flights of stairs as there was no lift (a kind builder helped us!) and the carpets were FILTHY with tiny, claustrophobic hallways. Our room was absolutely appalling - tiny, dirty, a hard bed with an uncomfortable plastic cover on the mattress, a shabby desk and chair with a tiny bathroom. The towels looked very suspect. The room was dark and looked onto an alleyway with an archaic air conditioning unit. We tried to stay out of the room for as long as possible for the day. When we came back, exhausted from our day of sightseeing, there was a fire alarm going off in one of the rooms down the hallway. We visited Reception twice and called them from our room, as did other disgruntled guests we met in the hall. We received a frosty and impatient response that the Maintenance guy would 'look into it' - it took him two hours to do so.After very little sleep, we ran out of this hotel at 8.30am. I made a complaint at Reception but didn't get any satisfaction as they said this hotel was advertised as being under construction and we should have duly received a discount for where we stayed from Expedia - none of this was relayed to me at my time of booking. Who would knowlingly book into a building site? We were eventually given the number for Expedia's Sales Support in the US - after two unsuccessful and stressful 10 minute phone calls, they couldn't even locate us on their system??

We walked down the hallway to the ""bedroom"" if you can call it that and I just got more disappointed. There was no bathroom in our room but it was down the hall where it had to be shared with others on our floor. The locks didn't even work that well because someone tried coming in while by boyfriend was taking a shower! There was one window in our room and the mini blinds weren't even long enough to go down to the window ledge! So people in the next building could have looked in if I hadn't blocked the opening with the towels and our bags. Then all that was in the room was the double bed, 2 small endtables (one on either side of the bed) and a very small ""closet"". There was only about a foot or maybe a foot and a half from the end of the bed to the wall and that's all there was to the room!!! The bed was hard and very uncomfortable. There was a tv in the room but in order to watch it you had to sit in a very uncomfortable position which hurt my neck. To only make things worse I was awakened in the middle of the night by the guest in the next room snoring. That's how thin the walls were.

That was important to me. We had a room with a double bed and a private bath, which was also important since we are older than most of the Belnord customers and use the bathroom frequently during the night. Our bathroom was new and spotlessly clean, though tiny, like everything else in this hotel. If you want a bath, you will have to sit with your knees bent. The shower, however, was nice. The sheets were clean. The maid service was nice and friendly, though we were given only one wash cloth daily, sometimes none, and our plastic glasses were not replenished. The room was about 9 feet by 10 or 11 feet, which included the closet and bathroom. The double bed was very small, and the pillows were about an inch thick. Everything in the room was of cheap quality. There was one bedside table and a small desk, both of pressed wood with some of the veneer chipped off. There was one straight-backed wooden chair with a filthy stained seat cover. The carpeting was filthy and stained; the wallpaper was hanging loose in a couple places around the window. There was a plastic zip-up mattress cover on the mattress, for which I was grateful, knowing that is a way to help prevent bed bugs. Outside air came right in around the window air-conditioner, though it did not matter to us in March because the room was warm enough to sleep in. When we turned on the heat briefly, the clanging in the pipes was loud and quite amusing. It wouldn't be amusing, though, if you actually needed heat and had to leave it on. The halls are very narrow; if you stick out your elbows, they will touch each wall ( and I am only 5'4"") - but who cares how wide the halls are? If you are obese, or very tall, you will not be comfortable here, however.  So why would one stay at the Belnord? Amazingly, $150/night is cheap in NYC, especially for this area. The location is wonderful, my favorite area in NYC. There are scores of good cafes and restaurants on Broadway and more on Amsterdam, between which this hotel is located. It is close to subway stations, the Natural History museum, Central Park, Zabars. We spent some time in the Barnes and Noble nearby and found the entertainment for the evening was a group of Times Square actors reading parts from short plays.

Shower head hung off the wall, taps spun round on the ends of the pipes and mould grew round the edges of the bath. All halls are filthy and absolutely stink of smoke – the room was meant to be non-smoking, but all they did was spray overpowering sickly air freshener around. The room was literally 2 single beds and no room to move. We had to look through our suitcases on the bed as nowhere to unpack.

I immediately looked behind headboards and in drawers for signs of bed bugs and all I found was a few black spots that could have been bed bug droppings (They looked exactly like pictures I've seen on the internet.) We slept with the lights on and kept our hard plastic suitcase (which is almost air tight) closed at all times. The first night as I was trying to sleep I noticed a blood stain on the wall right next to my bed which was the same size and shape as the stains I'd been warned about on the internet.

( I do not think one should expect this at the price one is paying here) There was an unusual smell, but it was not totally unpleasant, but I was on the ground floor so cannot comment on any other part of the hotel perhaps someone had brought in an Indian curry or something, so without airing out the rooms with the doors and windows open any odors left over may very well linger, and again for the money I did not find it something worth worrying about and after all I was in New York with so much to do. I did take my own silk sleeping bag and use this as I was concerned about the reports I had read. I checked out the bed as suggested and found nothing the first night or the second night on my third night I found something tiny and dead on the sheet, but refused to think about it I had one more night to sleep there. On my last morning (3 nights) I found 3 tiny dead bugs under my sleep sack, Now I checked the bed every night before going to bed so they appeared thru the night. I decided to have the hottest shower possible and leave asap I had been warned and because of finances chose to ignore this. If it had not been for the dead bugs I would have rated this place above average for New York prices, but sadly it REALLY does look like they have a bad problem with bugs, the sheets were changed every day and the mattress was encased in plastic as someone else said, but I still found bugs, I am still scratching but of course it is all in the mind!! New York is a great place to visit and I felt very safe as an older female solo traveler., I would not hesitate to go again but hopefully next time I can afford at least the standard of Holiday Inn Express which I guess I am going to have to pay around $300.00 per night(for the equivalent in Manhattan) and not $119.00 as I paid at The Belnord. I cannot say it was awful, but if I had a car at the door I would have probably not booked in, and gone looking elsewhere, but as my first trip to new york I neither wanted to spend the time or the money, as The Lion King, Inherit the Wind , an evening cruise on the Hudson, and many other delights may not have happended.","Hollywood, Florida","pooh8</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hollywood, Florida</strong>",86,2.0

I am pleased to say that all my fears dissipated as soon as got to the hotel.The location is fantastic; just one block from 86th St tube. The hotel itself is on a fairly quiet leafy street, but just off a main road. I was a solitary female so it was important to feel safe coming back to the hotel on an evening.I found the Hotel staff to be perfectly pleasant and helpful. A couple of times my key card deactivated and I couldn't get into my room. A quick trip back to the reception soon sorted this out.The room itself was fairly compact and quite basic, but what do you expect for only 68GBP (incl.) a night?! I was lucky enough to have a private bathroom which was spotless and I had everything I needed. I have to admit that having read so many reviews about bed bugs, I had almost convinced myself I would not be sleeping alone!! Again, I am pleased to say that I had no problem whatsoever and did not encounter any bed bugs.All in all I would recommend this hotel to any traveller on a budget or anyone wishing to save their money to be spent elsewhere (e.g shopping!!) If you are only in NY for a short trip, then realistically you are going to be spending a fraction of your time in your hotel room.

It was only $400 for 4 nights, which is a steal for NYC!! It is also in an excellent location. I was worried about bedbugs, but decided to risk it.We arrived Saturday night. There are 2 stairways, and apparently the other stairway leads to creepy abandoned rooms. More on that later.We climbed the EXTREMELY NARROW stairs up to floor 5. (No one helped the two of us carry our 4 bags up the 5 flights!!) I felt extremely claustrophobic here. The wall enclosures around the stairs are very close. We got to the room, opened the door, and the perimeter of the bed was about a foot smaller than the perimeter of the room. Also, itwas snowing outside, but it was so suffocatingly hot in the room thatwe had to turn on the air conditioner. So it was small and suffocating-great combo!!Down the hall, another tenant was blasting techno music and occasionally strolling down the hall barefoot-flashbacks to my freshman dorm room. Clearly this guy was living here. Then I went to the bathroom. I am very petite and the toilet was facing the wall with about an inch of space between the toilet and the wall. I had trouble squeezing into that space, so I can't imagine how anyone elsemanages. Also, there was no soap or towel in the restroom, meaning that everyone else there is NOT WASHING THEIR HANDS after using the facilities. YUCK.After about 20 minutes, we called my brother (who lives in Brooklyn) to come meet us. He apparently went up the other staircase, which ledhim to some creepy torn down area of the building that was reminiscent of ""The Shining."" Also, it was comforting to know that someone without a room key could stroll in the hotel and hang out on the floors-and even use the bathrooms! (Attention New Yorkers: Here is a public restroom alternative to McDonald's!!!)Top-notch security in place. I tried to show my brother the tiny weird bathroom (it was adjacent to my room and any noises in there could be heard very clearly). I pressed the door, which was unlatched, and someone was INSIDE and slammed it shut!! Who goes to the bathroom without closing the door or locking it??? In a hotel with shared bathrooms?? And you know he didn't wash his hands afterwards!!This hotel was all kinds of creepy and uncomfortable. I cannot stressenough the absurdity of requiring a/c in FREEZING COLD TEMPERATURES!!! I felt like I was being smothered with a hot blanket.YUCK.DO NOT STAY IN THIS TINY PIECE OF HELL. ENROLL IN COLLEGE AND LIVE IN A DORM ROOM INSTEAD.

I found Belnord and thought wow this is very cheap, so I booked it. After that I started reading the reviews and I got really scared. I didn't want to sleep somewhere that has bugs!!! I didn't find anything the last minute so we had to go there. My expectations were extremely low so I was some what pleasantly surprised when we were in the lobby. The two men who were in the reception gave us a bad first impression. They felt very unprofessional and kept making mistakes and apologizing. Our room was on the 4th floor and it was tiny!! I don't mind really, but when there might be bed bugs it doesn't sound at all appealing. The one huge plus was that the bathroom was right next to us and it was clean most of the time (unless the guys opposite the bathroom had already taken a shower, then it was dirty...). For the first three nights we slept with the lights off, then when on the third morning I found one tiny bedbug and killed it, we slept the rest of the nights (11!!) with the lights on. We found one bed bug after that but had no bites anywhere. When we got home, my husband had some in his waist and I found two in my leg. But that was all. I covered myself up pretty well and used this bug protection liquid on my skin. hehe. It smelled funny in the room and the air conditioner made a huge noise. When we were checking out, they made us pay $5/BAG (!!!!!!) to keep in the luggage room!!!!! So in total we had to pay $20!!!!! That was insane. I felt the people in the reception were always unprofessional and felt to me like they didn't know how to help and made me feel like I was dumb even asking.

A good rule of thumb that I found was fairly accurate was the number of stars a hotel claims to be, add two zero's onto the end of that to get your minimum nightly stay (ie: 2.5 stars = $250 per night). That's how it worked for us ... anyway, I found the Belnord through tripadvisor and ended up booking 5 nights there.A little about The Belnord hotel: to keep cost down, don't get the bathroom in your room, you get 4 bathrooms per floor of about +/- 10 rooms each. There is no elevator and smaller hallways. The room we had was roughly 8' x 12', enough for one double bed, a nightstand and not much walking room. The pillows were flat and bed was pretty hard. We packed a third suitcase with extra pillows and an extra sheet. We had ZERO problems with bugs as others claim. Bathrooms were very clean, no problems with waiting for others to get out. We paid $115 a night. We only slept in the room, our days and evenings were spent adventuring all over Manhattan.We flew into La Guardia airport, closest (and probably cheapest) to Manhattan. It was a $30 cab ride (incl. tolls & tip) from the airport to the Upper West Side where this hotel is. After you pick up luggage, DO NOT GO WITH THE PEOPLE TRYING TO SELL YOU THE SHARED RIDE OR DIRECT TRIP. They quoted us $55 plus tolls (we went through one toll, $4.50 I believe). We found a line that about 10-15 others were standing in and there was a guy hailing cabs for us - hence the $30 cab ride.The Belnord is one block from the subway, get a pocket map of the subway system and manhattan, it'll be your best friend. If you are there for 4 or more nights/days buy the unlimited subway pass for $24. It is $2 per person per ride no matter how far you ride on the subway. Good rule of thumb to begin at is you'll need to go atleast twice a day on it, from and to the hotel. We made the mistake of thinking we wouldn't use it as much as we did ... we're going to get the unlimited next time. You might be able to get away with getting one card and sharing it ...For Dave Letterman or Conan tickets, which are free, the further in advance you can try and request dates for, do it. At the beginning of October, for example, Conan was booked out until mid/late November. Although you can get standby tickets. Get to the NBC Studios Rainbow Room (outside, underneath the sign, on the Today show side) at around 7:30ish (in the morning) for the standby handout at 9:00am to have an excellent shot of seeing his show. For Letterman, you request online and they call you prior to the requested date, otherwise he has standy tix too. SNL tix get about 100,000 requests per year and they can only satisfy 8000 of them per season. Standby tickets for those get handed out on Saturday morning but people get in line on Friday early afternoon. If you like the Today show you can get there about 6:30am and have an another awesome chance of being right up against the gate they put up. We made it on national TV!For the Letterman fans, we went to Hello Deli and ate lunch there and also met Rupert! Nice guy! Good lunch too. There are so many restaurants to choose from it is crazy. We are in our mid-twenties and we liked Greenwich Village the best. It is trendier, more active and offers local night life as compared to touristy nightlife, lots of good restaurants and quite a few bars. John's pizza just by Times Square off Broadway to the East is very good pizza. Ask any local in/around Times Square and they should be able to tell you where it is at exactly.I'd definately recommend this: we bought for $77 a piece a guided tour of Lower Manhattan, Upper Manhattan on a double decker bus. Be forewarned, bring some ones for a tip to the tour guide/driver, especially if they have done a great job. This was on the red bus, there is also a blue bus that does the same thing. Included in our $77 was also tickets to the Empire State Building observation deck and the Statue of Liberty/Ellis Island. We saved about $10 pp doing that. This was good for 2 full days but they signed it for an additional day for us. PLUS you can get off and back on at any one of their MANY stops for free.","Lakeville, Minnesota","cpbrockman</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Lakeville, Minnesota</strong>",13,4.0

We read the reviews and it seemed that half of the people had great experiences and half had bed bugs. And stupidly we took our chances because of the fairly inexpensive price and good location. Well, like so many others have said, it's NOT WORTH IT. The first night I woke up with one very large bite on my lower back. I thought maybe it was a random spider or mosquito or something like that, but no, it was bed bugs. The second night of our stay, I woke up with about 6 bites all over my body. They itch like crazy. This was almost a week ago and I still have disgusting bites and scabs on my arms and back. It's one of the grossest things I've ever encountered. At checkout, I told the person at the front desk, they were apologetic, but in a sarcastic way. They asked why I didn't notify anyone earlier in a really condescending tone - like it was MY fault that I had been bitten.This hotel is deceiving. It lures you in with very reasonable rates and good location. It's nothing to rave about - the rooms are TINY, but the room we stayed in had a double bed, TV, AC, private bath - everything a couple on a budget could want out of a Manhattan hotel. (Not every room has a private bath and there are no elevators in the 5-story building.) Even the bathroom was very clean. When we first walked in to the room, I was pleasantly surprised by the ""apparent"" cleanliness.So, if you want to take your chances, stay here. But I guarantee you that I will NEVER stay here again.

After making myself comfortable in the box they consider a room I called the front desk to order a wake up call because there was no clock/alarm in the room. I noted that the bathroom was so small that sitting on the toilet your shoulder touches the wall and the other sholder is hanging over the tub (I'm not a big guy either; 5-11 180lbs.) While sitting you can outstretch your arm and be well over the sink (measures about 2x1 ft. While attempting to sleep I had to deal with the loud window A/C and the domestic argument across the hall. When staying at a hotel you expect to get your wake up call, mine at the Belnord never came; yep, the guy in the morning said ""they never put it in and I didn't start until 11pm so it wasn't my fault."" Great, thanks, glad it wasn't you... Anyway, when it was finally over, I was happy to be leaving. To top it all off, here I am almost a month later still fighting with them because they charged me for both rooms! Yep, they said that because I was a ""no-show"" that they charge the full cost of the room. For some reason it's hard for them to realize that someone that booked 2 rooms and checked into one could not have possibly been a ""no-show"" for the second room. Idiots. Seriously, stay somewhere else, it's the worst place I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty suspect places before.","Raleigh, NC","islandjack</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Raleigh, NC</strong>",6,1.0

The location is perfect in going to times square and central park and anywhere in manhattan! Checking in and out was easy and fast! It has a lot of bathrooms, you don't feel like you're sharing it with anybody. In fact, in my three day stay there I haven't once seen anybody else use it but me and my sister. I also like the fact that they have a full bathroom with tub/shower and toilet and sink and next to it is another restroom if you only need to use the toilet or the sink!! NO need to rush and wake up early just to use the shower! The negatives are the same as in most budget hotels, the sheets/beddings and towels are old and thin so you're better off bringing your own. Bring toiletries too. They don't have free soap and shampoo. (A CVS store is just around the corner if you need anything 24/7). The room has this old, musty, almost stinky smell so bring your own air freshener too! These aren't even complaints because you are in NEW YORK afterall, the most expensive city in the US if not in the world. For the price, this is surely not a dump!

And not forgetting to wash every single piece of clothing we took with us!!The location is fantastic and so is the area the hotel is situated in (safe and very NY). The rooms were really small and there wasn't a view. The staircase is narrow and hot, and if you live on the top floors it's a long way up after a long day of sightseeing. The rooms are cleaned regularly but the airconditioning makes for very artificial living.On the first day we checked the bed for bedbugs.....found none of course. We didn't really research the signs of bedbugs and one of them is little blood stains on the sheets and covers. We found those every day and we never thought anything of it.They also charge you $5 per piece of luggage that you store the day that you leave. It's a little good money earn because you have to check out by 12. Our flight wasn't until late afternoon so we had only booked a car to take us in the early afternoon. We were advised to this by a cabby who told us traffic is murder on the way to the airport. A good car company to book your car, reasonable rates JFK $46 + $4.5 for toll - --Final word, don't book this hotel no matter what, it isn't worth the money.

We didn't want to spend a lot, and I was thrilled to find the Belnord which looked nice and was in a good neighborhood AND less than $100/night, including tax!I booked it, and THEN I read the reviews. Bedbugs, tiny rooms, shared bathrooms. We didn't care that the room was tiny, because lets face it: we didn't come to NYC to sit around our room. The shared bathroom we weren't that concerned about either because we figured we were only gone one night, and if it was really nasty, we'd just wait until we got home the next night to take showers. The bedbug reviews, however, totally freaked me out. I knew I couldn't cancel my reservation, and I knew we couldn't afford any other hotels in decent neighborhoods.My friend's mom made her read 2 articles and watch a video on bedbugs and GAVE HER A QUIZ before we left! She is so funny. I was feeling okay, though, because I had read other reviews about the Belnord that said other people had read the bedbug reviews after booking, had been really freaked out, but had no problems whatsoever. I relaxed.THEN we got to the hotel. It was too early to check in, but the nice guy behind the desk let us leave our luggage in a luggage room while we spent some time sightseeing. While we were at the desk, a girl about our age was checking out of the hotel and said ""You might want to look into that room, because I woke up with these bites all over me! Look, I have like 40 bites and I itch like crazy! There's definitely something in that room!"" We flipped out. We listened to her say her room number, which was 170-something. We made a mental note in case they tried to give us that room. While we were sightseeing, we tried to come up with a plan. Sleep in bugspray? A scuba suit? Find a dog that was sick with a fever and let it sleep with us, since bedbugs seek out the warmest body???When we checked in, they did not give us that room. My friend knew what to look for, so as soon as we got to the (tiny) room, we tore it apart. The room was 10 feet by 7 feet, no lie. We didn't care, though, as I said. There was a plastic, zippered matress cover. We undid it and examined the seems for evidence of bedbugs. We took the headboard off the wall because that is another place bedbugs hide during the day. At the Belnord, you can lift the headboard and it comes off easily. No evidence there. We were reassured.The next time we were in the lobby, I said to the desk boy:""Remember that girl who checked out ealier and complained of bedbugs? Do you get that a lot? You can be honest, because I've already paid."" He got very flustered and said ""I don't know what to say! Maybe she just made that up to get a discount. If you have any problems with your room, we are here 24 hours a day and we will move you, no questions asked.""Although it was a little hard to sleep, knowing that there are bedbugs in the hotel, even if not in my room (and because the AC unit scared the mess out of me and woke me up every time it kicked on), we had no problems at all, I am happy to say. BOTTOM LINE: Do your homework before you go. Know what to look for as far as bedbugs are concerned. KNow the signs. Move if you have ANY concerns. They will switch your room for you. I would stay at the Belnord again because it is in a safe area and very convenient to the subway--only one block away and it is very affordable. THe bathrooms were clean and always available. You can always ask for our room, 203-9, because you know at least that one doesn't have bedbugs!

The rooms are tiny, but that is all we needed since we were only in there to sleep. We are two female college students with a tight budget. The location is perfect, just a block from a subway. The rooms were always clean when we arrived at the hotel at night. The bathrooms are cleaned in the morning, but I think that is the only time they are cleaned. The shower leaked a few times and the floor was full of water. We never had to wait for the bathroom, but I experienced 2 ice cold showers at 8am. The mornings I woke up at 6, I got a warm shower. The hotel staff wouldn't hook up the phone since they said it would cost too much. We tried calling collect from the payphones in the lobby but they would not work either. The payphones in the lobby cost $0.50 for a local call. On the street, it is $0.25. The front desk staff was OK, not too friendly.We stayed on the 4th floor, and there are no elevators. On our third day in NYC, my friend started getting red bumps all over. She thought it was just a reaction to her lack of sleep and stress from work. Her arms and back were covered in red bumps and she had bumps on her legs and face as well. The same night we got home, she went to the emergency room. The ER doctor told her it was from bed bugs. We thought it was weird how she got bitten and I didn't since we were in the same room. I read online it can take up to 8 days to react. Two days of being home, I now have red bumps all over and they are very, very itchy. When we opened the hotel room door a few times, we could smell something which was like sour milk or orange juice. I read online that when there are a lot of bed bugs in one area, they produce a sweet, sickly smell. Again, at that time we didn't think much of it since our hotel room was beside two washrooms.Overall, the hotel was OK.

We were on the 5th floor, no bugs at all, in fact the place was quite clean. I had not read the reviews prior to leaving or probably would have had the creeps! I stayed at a four star hotel in Boston last year, and three days later a five star hotel in Dallas, and came home with the itches described about bedbugs. Had no idea what was wrong with me, went to doctor, and found out. I did a lot of research on bedbugs after that, and now check when i check into a hotel. Did not have this problem.It is indeed a walk up so the flights of stairs are indeed good exercise (To get to floor 2, is 10 steps, turn, then 8), third floor (and every other floor (9 steps, turn then 8) ..yes I counted. Did not realize it was a walkup when I booked but I would have booked anyway.A staff member helped my fellow traveller with her suitcase.They do have a working ice machine---but you want to get a bag at reception, because you will not want to walk all the way up to the fifth floor to get the ice bucket, then down to fill it, then up again. The staff at the desk always accomodated us with a cellophane bag before we went upstairs.One block from 86th and Broadway subway station (did not know this when we first arrived and we took the Central Park West line and got off on 86th), a lot longer walk.Great 24 hour bread and bagel place around the corner.We went here for a fast and cheap vacation, since Jet Blue from Texas was 79 each way!We were amazed at how high hotels have gotten as it has been several years since I was in NY and used to be able to stay at the Days' Inn for 100-150, we found nothing below 250 when we internet searched several sites, so we took the Belnord at 99 for 4 nights and 79 for the last night (a Monday)Very small room (that's what I mean by european, it reminded me very much of the small rooms I have stayed in in Spain), tv worked, shared bathrooms really clean. They only give you two bath towels and one handtowel for two in a room. The maid one day stopped me and said ""propina""...I have no idea what that meant...she took out a dollar bill and rubbed it together in her hand---i surmised she wanted a tip, which I would have left upon check out....but I figured she thought she could get it if she did that. I have never had anyone do that before, and I suppose you could play the same game as she did (don't understand the language), and ignore the request if you wanted to. She was attentive to our room, so it didn't really bother me to do it, just the request was a bit forward, i thought.One of the reception clerks was rude to one of the people I travelled with, but the rest were very professioanl and urbane. Professionally dressed, well groomed, and polite. I had no problems that way. I felt safe at this hotel, and slept incredibly well. I thought the acoustics were great. I heard there was a sick baby near us that was crying in the hall one night---I never heard a thing,a nd I was awake at the time that happened.Again, not fancy AT ALL, and if you get a bug free room as we did, this is a good value for a great location.",Austin,"mesjournees</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Austin</strong>",59,3.0

My mom and I received this trip to NYC as a gift from my dad. The Belnord was where we were to stay. When I found these reviews and shared with my mom, we were terrified of what we'd find. We decided to brave it so we wouldn't hurt my dad's feelings.We stayed from March 17-20. The location of The Belnord was good. Just off of Broadway with lots of shops and places to eat. One block from the subway and very close to Central Park.We had a room with 2 beds and a private bath. We were on the first floor, so didn't have to lug our stuff up the stairs. I highly recommend getting a ""bigger and better"" room. The room was small, but met our needs easily. Had a window with a view and the heating system, TV worked fine. The room and bathroom were spotless and were kept that way each day. The shared bathrooms sparkled as well, and I never noticed a line. It seemed there were plenty of them. The staff was friendly and helpful and got everything we needed and included smiles and manners. Now what you REALLY want to know. The bedbugs. When we arrived on Friday we thoroughly examined the bed and room with no signs of the bugs. Each night when I'd happen to wake up, I would check the bed to make sure and no bugs. We were convinced that after staying three nights, there were no bugs, atleast in our room.That was until the last morning. When my mom got up from her bed, there sure enough was a bedbug!

I read every review of this hotel before we stayed here and I was really nervous about it and didn't know what to expect. This was a quick 3 night trip with my wife that we booked at the last minute. We just wanted to see some Broadway shows and we had tickets to Letterman(great time by the way), and we wanted to go cheap this time. We went to NY in July with our daughter and stayed at the Edison. We absolutly loved the Edison and it was perfect for the 3 of us. Of course we paid $160 a night and spent about $3000 all together for a week long trip. For the Belnord we only spent $48 a night. The hotel was not nearly as nice, but it was servicable and fit our needs perfectly. First, the room was the smallest room i've ever stayed in. We booked a shared bath (a private bath was twice as much), which was inconvient but not intolerable. The shared bathrooms were always clean and there were enough of them that we never had to wait in line or anything. We only used the room for sleeping in, as we got up early and came in late. Second, the staff. The staff was unfriendly and acted like we were bothering them whenever we needed anything(i.e. extra towels, hair dryer, wake up call), but our needs were minimal and this wasn't much of a problem. Last, location. Last time we came to NY we stayed in Times Square close to the theatre district. I was a bit leary of staying on the upper west side were the Belnord is located because I didn't want to spend a lot of money on transportation and I wanted to be able to get around easily. This location was excellent. We were a block away from the subway that ran up and down Broadway. We saw 4 plays and it took us an average of 15 minutes to get from our hotel to the theatre. It's also within walking distance to central park. Overall for a quick cheap trip the Belnord worked out really well.Prosvalue priced,great location,clean, no bedbugs!, luggage storage for late flights, several good restaurants close by(Carmine's is awsome), cable tv, easy to get a cab, safe neighborhoodConsno elevator, shared baths, noisy rooms, very small rooms, staff not very accomodating, rooms often coldWe would probably stay here again, just not with our daughter. I wouldn't reccomend it for families, but it's good for couples, singles, or friends.","Branson, Mo","Landshark78</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Branson, Mo</strong>",48,3.0

I paid around US$70 per night, as there was a special on for the winter season. Overall I was satisfied with what I received. My room was quite small, cosy, with a small television and a narrow wardrobe. There was also no elevator but it's not like everyday you have to tote luggage up the flight of stairs. As it was winter and freezing outside, I spent a lot of time indoors. I had no complaints about the heating, shared bathrooms (which were always clean), or the traffic outside (I was on the 3rd floor and I didn't even hear it). My only complaint - & thinking back it could have been a serious one - was the heater which make a loud noise at times, sometimes late at night, and made me wake up a few times. Had I planned to spend a longer time, I would have asked for a change of rooms. On the upside, I found the staff to be very friendly and willing, even those who had trouble speaking English.

Tick tock, it's about time to change that way of thinking at least when it comes to Belnord. I've stayed in dozens of hotels in USA and this is the worst I have come across. I'm not into luxury and usually am entertained what comes to problems with hotels- but Belnord makes even all the hotel comedy series look lame and definitely boring. The question is will you be ready to pay for this fun?I booked via ---- for six nights in January 2006 and paid in advance so there was a little risk of finding the hotel unbearable. Opening the room door convinced me already of troubles. After putting the lights on I lowered the window blinds just to find out they were not long enough to cover the long windows even if you tried adjusting them. There goes the privacy. The other window had been fixed with tape to keep it in place while the upper part of it had a broomstick put across to prevent opening it from the other side. There goes the safety. The view from the window included a tall brick wall and garbage containers. By this time I had also noticed the loud noise which reminded me of a truck parked right on the backyard with its motor running. The sound of traffic I can take but this sound of something much louder than any air conditioning system was very irritating. It stopped after the midnight but just for some hours. There goes the peace.Then came the cold. I come from Finland where temperatures go easily down to minus degrees but never in my life have I felt such an intense cold as in my room. The heating unit wouldn't work and when I explained the situation in the reception a spanish speaking man came to see about it. I tried telling him I've been working on the heater for hours but he said couldn't understand english at all. First he asked for ten minutes so I patiently waited for a miracle to happen. Then the man suddenly stood up claiming the AC unit was hot which it wasn't. For this simple word ""hot"" I had something to say back ""not hot or even warm"". The man looked careless about the whole thing and simply mumbled ""I'm sorry"". We walked back to the reception area but the hotel staff only wanted to hear what the man had to say- of which I didn't understand a word as it was all in spanish. I got an extra blanket- I almost caught a flu too on the following night. Six nights- such a long time when returning to the hotel was almost undesirable. I would go there for just to sleep and then get off first thing in the morning. I don't like writing in a bad --- style like this but every hotel is only as good as the worst it has to offer to its customers. Ruining or even harming somebody's business is not my intention but finding something good about Belnord is quite impossible. Belnord makes sleeping on the street a good option. You have been warned- I didn't believe the worst things people came up with but maybe you should.","Helsinki, Finland","cincinnatirocks</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Helsinki, Finland</strong>",19,1.0

Right before we arrived at the hotel we saw the reviews that there were bed bugs and had only hoped that they had taken care of the problem before we checked in. We were totally wrong the first night we were there we found one on the bed and went down to the office and asked for a new room but they acted like they didn't even know they had the bed bugs! I mean after the 10 reviews of people saying they complained about bed bugs how could they not know. So then they offered to give me another room on the 4th floor without a private bathroom eventhough I paid for one with a private bathroom. So when i said they would have to refund the difference they said we'll see what we can do. So before I carried all of our luggage up to the 4th floor since there is no elevator i asked my mom to go up and check the room. When she turned on the light she immidiately found a huge bedbug on the bed and brought it down to the front desk and they still did not offer any assistance.  We went to NY on one of the busiest weeks and there were no other vacancies so we were forced to sleep there! We bought a plastic cover for the bed, moved the bed to the middle of the room, and slept with the lights on every night. We felt like we were on ""SURVIVOR"" taking turns sleeping. The bathroom was clean but the room was run down and there were bed bug egg shells everywhere. Everynight we killed at least 2 that were on the carpet and on the walls. Rude staff who didn't know anything. Nice location but they need to close this hotel down for about a month and exterminate they have an infestation!

I travel frequently to different cities, and book through hotels. I have probaly stayed in NYC a dozen or more times this year. Hotels usually puts me at a decent location. Being that I am usually in town for 2-3 days max and working outside of my room, i tend to not want to pay over $200 per night. This time around, my regular spots were fully booked. So when the representative from Hotels offered this ""hotel"" i accepted. I booked my room with a queen ( i am 6'6) and requested a private bath as i usually do. I even called the ""hotel"" myself 30 minutes later to confirm my reservations. All was good, or so i thought. Four days later, on a friday night, i get to NYC and head to the Belnord. Instantly i got a real funny feeling. The sidewalk filthy, drunks sitting around rapping and the place looked more like a ran down apartment building. There was about 10 people in the ""lobby"" which made it crowed. I check in with the rude ""front desk"" person who after about 10 mins of talking on this cellphone finally gives me my key card and point me to my room. Room was a dump, nasty looking sheets, white towels turn brown sitting on the bed, no private bath and a single window pluged with an AC older than my grandmom which is right next to the bed. Oh, and did i say there was a twin bed in the room?The ""closet"" could not even fit my suit bag. The place was so nasty i was afriad to put my bags on the floor. I have seen elevators that look and smell better than this place. If there were a fire, two people couldn't walk side-by-side in theses hallways. I go out to the desk to explain there might be an error and ask to be moved, and without saying a word he points to a hand written sign that says ""No vacancy."" And you bet he was on his cellphone. My guess is i was a disruption to his conversation. So at this point, i am fuming. I call hotels and they call the ""hotel."" I get the "" we had to move him because the bathroom in his room isn't working story"" and they are willing to reduce my rate if i would stay for the night and then be moved into another dump in the AM. Considering the ""service i had gotten thus far, my answer was "" give me back my money!"" I checked out within 25 mins of coming in, and found a differnt hotel right over the river in NJ.

Through Hotels.com I booked a double with a private bath, although it was just myself (private bath appears to be an option only for doubles). The room was clean and small but not claustrophobic (thanks to the very high ceilings); the bathroom was small and spotless. It would have been okay for two people, although the double bed was in a corner, so one person would've been sleeping against the wall. There was no view, as it was on an airshaft, but that made it nice and quiet (no street noise!). The weather was mild while I was there, so I didn't need heating or cooling, but I did turn on the fan-only setting of the window heating/cooling unit for air circulation. The fan was relatively quiet and provided white noise for extra noise insulation. My room was on the ground floor, which was convenient, but I wouldn't have minded a room on an upper floor because I had only one small bag with me. The gentleman at the desk when I checked in and again when I checked out was very friendly. I had no experience afterwards of rashes or any other potentially bug-related symptoms as some other reviewers have mentioned. (I wonder whether they perhaps reacted to detergents or other cleaning agents?)The location was great for me because I was visiting a friend who was staying on East 86th, and the hotel (which is on West 87th almost at the intersection with Broadway) is very close to the 86th Street crosstown bus, which made it convenient for us to meet up with each other.

Then he asks me to hang around for 15-20 mins while he tries to get ahold of the manager but I've had enough, so I go over to belnord instead and there I tell the guy (who ended up being very friendly and helpful) the story and he tells us he has a twin room with a private bath (we had wanted a double bed) so we take it...But I say we still want to talk to the manager and we are advised that she will be there Monday AM...Monday AM comes and no manager in site, apparently she has had an accident (yea right)...Basically it was one excuse and lie after another and I still havent heard from a manager about a refund after everything we went through.

My partner paid for both flights and the accomodation so understandably he had a tight budget for our hotel.Secretly I was dreading our stay at the Belnord, however I was kinda relieved when we arrived to find that it was fairly presentable from the street. Inside was ok too i thought - more of a hostel than a hotel, but ok. We had an en suite bathroom and a double bed. The bedroom was tiny and once we'd shopped there was barely any floor space (we probably only had 5 or 6 shopping bags) but it didn't matter really! The window didn't open which was supposedly made up for by the aircon machine...it wasn't, the room was hot and the aircon was old and noisy, but again, who cared, we were hardly there. As a big plus, our bathroom was very clean and there was a tv (ideal for checking out the weather as the window faced a brick wall and the climate indoors was misleadingly tropical!). Basically we didn't mind the more negative aspects of the hotel because the location was excellent! Upper west between Amsterdam and Broadway and minutes from central park. The route is on one of the main subway lines and the walk is not too far into the centre or over to the east side. It's safe and there's a calm feeling to the area. Check out Blondies for a great veggie burger and the Gin Mill bar on Amsterdam is cool. Overall I had a great time in New York and it wasn't in any way affected by our choice of accomodation, as I'd first assumed it'd be. On returning to the UK my inital reaction when asked about our hotel was ""yeah, fine, it was a clean place to stay with easy access to everywhere"". BUT......it's now thursday 2nd December and since last weekend I've become covered in itchy spots!!! Of course I don't know for sure that they're bed bug bites, or even that they've come from hotel if they are, but it does seem a bit of a coincidence don't you think, what with all the other reviews that mention it???? Had the spots not erupted since my stay I would definitely have gone back to the Belnord if I ever returned to NYC on a budget, now i'm not so sure.

The room I stayed I was equipped with a microwave and a fridge which came in handy. One thing that may turn people away is the fact of sharing a bathroom.

The Belnord sounded ideal and we were thrilled with our comfy little room (I did request private bathroom though as I'm overly fussy). The neighbourhood had a really safe feel to it with lots of stores and eating places all very close, of particular mention was the grocery store over on Broadway - so convenient and stocked with anything and everything.The desk personnel were terrific - especially ARMANDO - extremely polite, helpful and friendly chap - cleaners did a great job on our room too. With the hotel just a trot away from the 86th Street subway on Broadway, and another station in the other direction right next to Central Park, getting out for sightseeing couldn't have been more convenient, or safer, any time of day or night we wandered around.So thanks Belnord for contributing to my friend and I having a great time in New York and enjoying her birthday with good memories.(If there is a negative to comment on, it was due to the smokers that hung around the front doorway and their clouds of smoke circulating around the establishment).","Grayson, GA","Pathfinder3586</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Grayson, GA</strong>",3,4.0

Picture a small box :)","Wynnewood, PA","Wanderer23450</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Wynnewood, PA</strong>",2,3.0
