I've heard great things about Yotel and the techy side of my bf was excited to see Yobot as well. Booked through a third-party site last minute and it seems that because I booked through a third-party, I was given a room that was probably last sell.Here's the thing - I've toured this hotel before being in hospitality and saw this property, saw the cabins, and had a general idea of what we will be getting. The room we received was very much lacking what I expected. First of all, we arrived late at night and had a little trouble check in - to no fault of the agent checking us in. Apparently there was another guest with my same name, though spelled differently (how it was mistaken when I gave them my ID). Let me digress a bit - there should have been mention that there was a facility fee at check in because I was not aware until I checked out. And even if I knew, it should have been courtesy because I was told that my reservation is all paid for and that they were only holding an incidental charge of $100 which will be released upon checkout - this was not the case. First hidden charge - that is a front desk training issue.Secondly, when we arrived to the room, while it was small, that was expected given the capsule hotel design. The room did optimize the space and I was a fan of the bed. However, we had no hot water and had to call for facilities to come by at midnight - I had called ahead and informed the property that we would be arriving late and they should have ensured the room was functioning before checking us in.Other issues that popped up during the stay - no curtain between the bathroom and the bedroom even though the tracks were on the ceiling. Leaking sink - we ended up stuffing towels underneath it. Mirror at the bathroom had electrical issues as it wouldn't turn on unless you tapped it a few times and finally the towel rack heater was not working and I had called to have this fixed and it never was looked at. Oh and we did not have a TV remote in the room and had to call three times for it to be sent up. Heads up: they charge you for luggage storage as well - which is usually a complimentary service for most full-service hotels. Overall, since we were out most of the day and stayed a short time, I didn't really care for the tits and tats, but they kept adding up which was annoying.","Boston, Massachusetts","thelifeofso</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Boston, Massachusetts</strong>",0,3.0

Event though the hotel wants to be hip and futuristic.The check in kiosk's were easy to use BUT when you suddenly are requested to pay without having a sum on the screen it feels very odd. I had no idea what and how much I was paying for as the hotel had been payed for in advance. Check out was fast and easy!Humans: The personnel on the 4th floor ""reception"" lacked customer friendliness. All of them. The first lady was totally uninterested in helping us out. The second lady was more interested in the computer than in helping people out (we were second in the que).The security guy that was escorting us to a new room was in fact almost rude. The Lobby/first floor luggage help guys lacked also normal customer friendliness. Rooms: really worn out. Stained carpet, furniture scratched to the point it looked dirty. Bed: No feel of a gel memory foam mattress either, the bed was rock hard. Plus for the adjustability. For a tall person the bed was too short. TV didn't work. Asked about it in the reception and we were told that someone would fix it. It wasn't fixed, so asked about it and was told that nothing can be done. Asked if we could get another room with a functioning TV - got one but the lightning was stuck in the ambient light mode (far from relaxing) in that room so decided to stay in the original room. Shower/toilet gave no real privacy to the others in the cabin. The room was a cabin, like on a cruise ship.Other: The much mentioned Manhattan's biggest and best Terrace was closed.

Minimum wait for lifts even at busy times. Cvs pharmacy/ supermarket opposite 24 hours for supplies. Next to that across road is a deli that does fantastic breakfast rolls for about 5 dollars. A short walk to Times Square- a 20 minute walk to Central Park. Only one tiny thing that’s a bit strange is that no kettles are in room- if you’re a big tea/ coffee drinker take a travel kettle.
