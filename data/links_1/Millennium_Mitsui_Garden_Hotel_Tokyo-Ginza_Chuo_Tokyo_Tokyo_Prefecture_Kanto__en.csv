Staff were friendly, attentive, and professional. We had the base room category and while some people complain about the wall view you get from the window, it didn't bother us that much as we didn't spend much time in the room other than to sleep (of course a view would've been nice, but it didn't take away anything from our experience). The room was clean and I found the mattress hard (which I prefer) and slept quite comfortably. The room layout was a little bit strange in that you don't have a fully enclosed bathroom. ex. there's a stall for the toilet and another stall for the shower, and your sink is next to the closet. I think the open concept is just to maximize space? The wifi was also very bad. We couldn't connect to it and when we could, it was very slow and the connection would die again. I think it's an issue they're working on and they placed an additional router in our room that helped with the issue. We booked this hotel for 4 nights at the beginning of our trip, left for a week, and returned here for our last night in Tokyo before going back home. We left a piece of luggage in storage and when we returned, they had it already placed in the room for us and the additional router for our wifi connection. These were small details, but was very much appreciated as these details make guests feel like they're cared for. Overall, the staff were very nice and professional, the room was clean, and the location was great.

Let's start with the basis first. I paid full price for this hotel booking with chase concierge service. I was debating between this and intercontinental (which I often stay at for work), so this time I decided to try something new and I really regret it. Let's start with the pros and cons.Pro:Room are clean, comfortable and the renovation is new.Air purifier with humidifying fiction is provided. (This seem pretty standard in Japan actually)Bathroom and shower is cleanLocation is great, it is right next to the Ginza subway stationCon:1) WiFi is slow. By slow I don't mean I can't load up my streaming app kind of slow, I mean I can't open websites kind of slow. In all my years in Japan, I have never seen wifi this slow, 711 has faster internet than this hotel. And I do mean that in a literal sense since 711 provide free Wi-Fi2) I was placed in the top floor of this hotel, so I was thinking to myself, oh great.. I'll get a view... But nope I was wrong! My view from the room is a wall!!!! I'm not kidding, I look outside the window it is a wall. So the front desk person told me that the standard room that I booked are all facing walls. I was like WTF, I was never told that in any listing or anyone that I was spoken to. I learned in the past to never take garden view rooms, so I know for a fact this did not come up because I pay attention to these things. After I told the front desk about that, he was like you should have picked the superior room and it cost more. So I told him, I wasn't even given this option when I booked, if I knew I wouldn't have booked this room or this hotel at all. After that he proceed to tell me that the hotel is full but he can upgrade me to the superior room tomorrow free of charge. so I came back the next day, I was talking to the lady at front desk about this. At the end she was telling me the same story on how it cost more and I told her that the guy I spoke to the night before said it would be free. At this point she talked to her manager, who came out speaking in Japanese to her, after that she just said the rooms are full. I would say that's pretty low for them to lie like that. Honestly I didn't think it was a big deal, I have stayed in intercontinental/Marriott many times and they always upgrade me for free without any issues. Since it doesn't cost the hotel anymore money to switch an unhappy guest to another room, I don't see why they wouldn't do it because you now risk losing future business. Anyway with that said the price I paid for this hotel was the same as intercontinental/Marriott so I really regret staying at millennium instead of other hotels. I'm checking out tomorrow, let's see how that experience go, I'll update if anything changes.","Ginza, Japan","stevelamsf</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Ginza, Japan</strong>",1,2.0

We got mixed up and visited both, so that you won't make the same silly mistake as us. But it is a cozy hotel to stay in. Location is superbly convenient with Higashi-Ginza (East Ginza) station just right smack in front of the hotel, and Ginza station is like....5 mins walk away. Hibiya station (if you enjoy walking) is also not very far, probably another 15 mins walk.Food, convenience stores, shopping, are massively abundant in the vicinity. But...so many small lanes around you may get lost if you are not good with navigating. Try travelling with GPS.Staff is friendly, can understand English, but converse slow. It was acceptable. Rooms are smaller than expectation, but the pillows are very comfortable. Honestly. So comfortable we were contemplating of buying some back only to find that we may not fit them in our luggage during the last day and gave up the idea.... :DProximity of the buildings are rather close and practically no view from the window unless you enjoy saying hi to the fella at the window in the next building. We had our curtains drawn throughout the entire stay. We had to.Breakfast though is not that sufficient. Simple spread at the basement lounge, you can find the basic options there and that's about it. Staff is friendly, but there is this area that covers about 3-4 tables that catches the morning Sun...so hot, it's like dining in the greenhouse. And perhaps we were a little bit too sensitive but we couldn't help but felt that western and local guests got a wee bit more attention than us.After two mornings of trying out the breakfast, we skipped them entirely. There are a lot more better food options around the area than dining with perspiration while didn't feel welcomed...Upon checking out, the front desk was apparently understaffed but we still caught the attention of a female staff who went all the way out to the main road to get us a taxi. Where are the concierge or porter? For a moment we thought we were staying in a budget hotel.... ha...But a big thank you going out to the hardworking female front desk who checked us out and making sure we understood every single details on the bill, assuring us that she will return, and jog back to us with the taxi and made sure the driver understood where we were to go to. We regretted not getting her name.... Thank you.Overall, it is a hotel with great location amidst all the confusion and is still a good one to stay in nevertheless.PS. not sure when it will complete, there is construction of something right in front of the hotel.

The hotel is new and really modern with great amenities. I love the design of the elevator banks that is really fast and efficient. We reserved a corner room that offers ample room but requires reservation well ahead of time. Our room was really functional and well designed offering the comfort of a five star hotel. We even had a air purifier and a small fridge with ample room. The room also contains one of my favorite: BULGARI Shampoo and Shower gel as well as Air Conditioner and body moisturizer a real treat! Easily comparable to the Four Seasons or the Ritz but at a much better value. Love these Toto Japanese toilet. Service was overall very good. We had a small incident where we felt that the receptionist was not really eager to help. On the other hand Rio May went out of her way to help us several times. The hotel was also very helpful in securing several Michelin starred restaurants. So we are very grateful for their helping hand.

The rooms were typically small Tokyo hotel rooms, but they were beautifully decorated, immaculately clean, and ultra modern. Our favorite was the toilet which opened, closed, and flushed automatically. Lots of fancy Shiseido products. Seemed like every drawer had more goodies including fancy pajamas. Our room had a view of the Kabuki theater and over the city. Service was excellent and most of the staff spoke some English. They also had the ""Handy"" smartphone, as many hotels in Japan now do, which was super helpful in saving data and other fees using my home phone.

It’s most convenient getting to many tourist spots and great restaurants. We stayed in a deluxe twin room at the corner with windows on two sides. It’s quite spacious according to Tokyo standards. The room was nicely appointed with a free mini bar providing a free bottle of red wine, sake, beer and soft drinks each day. For the lady using the room, they provided a free supply of Mikimoto cosmetics. And they used Bulgari toiletries. Housekeeping made the room clean and tidy and ensured that toiletries and the mini bar were replenished each day. The response to service requests was in general fast. I would have given the hotel five stars if not because of the absence of a gym, and the service attitude of certain individual front desk staff. In the afternoon on 5 July we sought help from a female staff to book a tour to Mt. Fuji and Hakone the next day for our party of six. Giving the excuse of there being too many different options, she declined to make the call for us and asked us to call the tour company ourselves. If we knew Japanese we would not have asked for help. In the evening on the same day, three ladies were on duty at the front desk. We sought advice on transportation to Narita airport early in the morning on 7 July. As the earliest airport coach would leave a nearby hotel at 7:15 am, which was too late for us. As there were six of us with more than 10 bags, we asked what alternatives we had. We were told to take the underground, which actually was not a viable option at all. We asked about taxis and were told that they were too expensive. We weren’t told about how much it would be and we weren’t asked whether we were prepared to accept the high fare. We asked whether there were transportation companies providing transfer services to the airport and were told that there weren’t. All three ladies showed no concern at all to find a solution for us and were totally not helpful. All they cared about was to get rid of us. As we had to find a way to the airport, we approached the front desk again later that evening. A gentleman was on duty then. He was most helpful and immediately made a couple of calls and secured two seven-seaters from a transportation company for us to leave the hotel at 6:00 am on 7 July. We were of course happy to pay a total of ¥46,000 for the two cars. The ladies concerned were very untypical of the services we have encountered in Japan. We visit Japan quite often and are always impressed by the courteous and attentive services we receive wherever we go. It is difficult to build a reputation for oneself. But it takes only a couple of unpleasant incidents to ruin it. ",Hong Kong,"chrischma</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong</strong>",68,4.0

The double room was full and was left with a slightly higher-priced twin room – and what a pleasant surprise it turned out to be! The biggest surprise (in a good way) was the size of the twin room – it was much larger that I had anticipated for a Tokyo room. There was more than sufficient space for 2 persons (2 super single beds) and space to lay our luggage down on the floor of the bed room. What was interesting in the design (and perhaps that was well thought out) was that the wash basin was located outside of the main bathroom. I believe this freed up a bit of space which would otherwise have been taken up by an overall larger bathroom. Well done!Apart from the room, the hotel was also located right in the heart of Ginza. That means: a. Good location to subway stations – but Tokyo JR Station was slightly farther – at a 20 min walk away b. 24-hour convenience store just downstairs from the hotel & plenty of restaurants and bars were around the hotelc. main shopping belt at Ginza was literally at the doorstep d. room was brightly colored and clean e. stayed in winter – room was well insulated If I had one gripe about the hotel – it would be noise insulation. Being right at the heart of Ginza means a fair amount of traffic downstairs. While the noise was not intrusive, if you are a light sleeper, it might be useful to request for a room facing away from the main street.

The guy offered us a WiFi box/router that we could pick up when we got back to the hotel.When we got back, the woman at the counter said they were ""out of stock"" and we should just keep trying to connect to the WiFi every 10 minutes. She said she had no idea when the guest(s) with the router(s) would return it and there was nothing she could do.Long story short, we didn't get the router until the third night of our stay. Until then, their Wi-Fi was useless regardless of time of day (midnight, 6 a.m., 8 a.m.) which was extremely vexing as some of us had urgent work matters to attend to.If connectivity is important to you, make sure you reserve a router with the hotel (and confirm it with them) before you get there.","Los Angeles, California","S1331IImm</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",18,4.0

Lots of good food around the hotel. I'll definitely recommend Ramen Takahashi, Ginza Noodles, Kagari Ginza. Also great bars less than 10 minutes walk (Bar High Five, Bar Mimi and Lupin). Family mart around the corner. Uniqlo in Ginza also less than 5 mins in the event you need more clothes haha. Room was simple, but very comfortable.

One block away from the Ginza main strip and right on top of the Higashi-Ginza station. The Ginza station is only a block away.There are about 6 convenience stores located within a 3-5 minute walk from the hotel.I got to the hotel via a NEX train from Narita to Tokyo station, then it was a short taxi ride to the hotel. It is also possible to skip the taxi and take the subway from Tokyo station, which I might do on my next trip.The service was great. I wanted to make reservations at several restaurants a couple of months before my trip and the hotel was happy to oblige to my emailed requests. Communication was good, my requests were handled by multiple people over the course of weeks and none of them dropped the ball and I did not need to follow up at all. Everything was confirmed before my trip. The hotel does put a hold on your credit card when you check in though depending on the restaurants that you book, as some restaurants have a cancellation policy. Rooms are not huge but not small by Tokyo standards. It was able to accommodate my 2 suitcases. I've been in other hotels where there isn't enough room to open a suitcase and you have to do on the bed. No problem here. I have a very large suitcase and I had enough room to open it. Housekeeping is efficient and the rooms are very clean and tidy.The layout of the bathroom is a little funny, so it might work better for a couple than say 2 people sharing. The main sink is in the hallway between the front door and the bed. The shower is excellent though. I love the idea of a shower room. There is a small open closet just by the door to the room which is convenient. I know some hotel rooms in Tokyo are so small that there isn't anywhere to hang anything. As I was staying for 9 nights the wardrobe space came in very handy.The bed was a little hard for me, but was acceptable. Personal preference really. The trade off to the fantastic location of this hotel is the noise from the street. I think there might be an emergency services depot nearby because I heard many sirens throughout my stay, day and night. I didn't hear much noise from other rooms though, which was good.All in all a very pleasant stay.

It must be one of the most convenient location for one to get around Tokyo to key sights, shops and restaurants.Rooms are considered to be of good size for a Japanese hotel in the heart of Tokyo, with very well organized lay out. However, a two occupant room really only fit 2 person, and if you have a teen, you need to either get a 3 bedroom or an extra room and I did not see any adjoining rooms. Rooms are clean with ample sunlight that comes with good quality toiletries and a change of pajamas daily. However, there is no gym nor swimming pool, so if you want to run, you can do that nearby around the Imperial Palace which is just a few minutes run from the hotel, definitely a much better choice than to run in a gym. Front office and concierge speak English and are helpful to help get you around Tokyo.

First off, the location of the hotel is prime because it's right around the corner from beautiful/bougie shopping district: Ginza. It's not in the middle of all the shopping commotion, which is preferred because you have the luxury of getting away from all the crazy. Additionally, the Higashi-Ginza train stop is conveniently in front of the hotel for those that are brave enough to explore Tokyo by it's rail station (highly suggest it with the help of Google maps, which is surprisingly accurate!). The staff here were attentive and very helpful from beginning to end. The consistently available multi-lingual staff was greatly appreciated. Lastly, the most important detail of all is cleanliness and I can say the hotel is very clean and exceeds expectations. The reasons I did not give an 'excellent' overall rating is due to the following: the max number of persons per room is 2 and is strictly enforced. This insinuates that the rooms capacity is at most: 2 persons. Do not take this fact for granted because the rooms are quaint! It is well stocked and has all the amenities you may need while away from home, but for a second person to move around the bed - is almost impossible unless you hop over the bed from the same side as the other. Secondly, the mattress and pillows are quite tough. I felt as if I was sleeping on a tatami with no cushion whatsoever. Other than that, I would stay at this hotel again!",,Kohlett M,2,4.0

The hotel is clean and in a nice location close to a lot of shopping and restaurants. The staff is very courteous and helpful. While I enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to someone looking to stay close to Ginza, it wouldn’t be my first choice for business travel. Things I loved – 1. The front desk staff is lovely and helpful. They answered a plethora of questions from my co-workers and myself. They also provided us with a small business card with a map/address of the hotel and wrote out the address in Japanese for our office so we could always use with taxi drivers and limit the communication gaps. Not all hotels will do this. 2. They will mail your post cards for you and the postage is complimentary. That is a small perk but a noticeable one. I send my kids postcards from every business trip and sometimes it’s a pain. Some hotels will just bill your room, others make you pay, so it was a nice surprise to be told they will post and mail them free of charge. 3. Walking distance to wonderful Ramon, local food and all sorts of shopping. Close to Tsukiji Market and the Kabukiza theater. Location is excellent. 4. Taxi’s are always out front if you need them. We never waited for a taxi. 5. Train station is close and easy to access. Airport Limousine Bus stop is a about a 5 min walk from the hotel. Just be mindful if you have a lot of luggage that you can’t navigate without a cart. 6. Complimentary water – 2 bottles a day in the fridge in the room7. Wi-fi worked well for me and I could download and watch movies. Things I wasn’t too excited or happy about – 1. The rooms are extremely small. Yes, this is Japan and yes, most hotels in Japan have small rooms. However, I’ve traveled to Japan numerous times for business and I’ve never seen such a small room. (Someone else on our team choose this hotel so we had no idea how small the rooms were compared to other hotels we’ve stayed in around Tokyo.)2. The restaurant doesn’t offer any western selections. While I love Japanese food, when you are on the road for business for weeks at a time, sometimes you just want some English tea and toast etc. They do have a large breakfast buffet that we ate at once but felt it wasn’t worth the price for the overall selection offered compared to other large hotels. Dinner is a smaller menu and again not a wide selection. Also, no room service, that was disappointing as well. Sometimes when you spent a day traveling you just want a shower, food delivered to your room and a bed. Also, can we just get some English breakfast tea in the room please? This is pretty standard in most hotels I’ve stayed in while in Japan. 3. There is only one English speaking channel and unfortunately that is CNN (constantly negative news). Not only is this the only English channel on the TV selection, certain times of days they voice over the English speakers with Japanese. No English movie selections, pretty much not an option whatsoever. So if you want English be prepared to watch on your own device or not watch at all. 4. Views - I was traveling with three other co-workers and non of us had a view. Two of us faced a building and you could see people working and what was on their computers so we left our blinds down always when in the room. One co-worker faced the street in front of the hotel and even with the blinds down there was a billboard across the street that lit up at night and woke him up every night. Views aren't everything but it is nice to be able to have your blinds open, especially with such small rooms.","San Francisco, California","travelbumpkinn</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Francisco, California</strong>",55,4.0

Good choice again.The check in was seamless and the staff congenial. Upon entry into the foyer, you are welcomed by the subtle perfume of roses - a lovely touch. The decor in reception is contemporary and delightful - artistic and restrained.Whilst the hotel has no porter service, with modern travel bags this is unnecessary. Our room was the epitome of good interior design, providing carefully thought out arrangement of all necessary amenities. On 13th Floor, we had a view of the city in the background and a rooftop garden of a nearby building where there was rice being cultivated. The bed was very comfortable, shower room with soaking bath and Hansgrohe thermostat-controlled tapware were just great. Every aspect of the design was so well thought out. So good, too, to have an ironing board and steam iron provided. The only quibble was that no English language TV available. Even CNN news over dubbed in Japanese. This would not ordinarily be a problem, but we wished to keep au fait with the North Korean situation.

We needed a room that would accommodate 3 adults. I have status with Hilton and IHG, but the rooms I found on their websites would have beds for 2 and then a rollaway. I did not want this. I searched on a website that allowed specifying bed types and found the Millennium. At first I was uncertain, but then I remembered staying at a Millennium hotel in Rotorua, New Zealand that was very comfortable.We booked the Millennium Mitsui as part of an American Airlines vacation package that included flights on JAL. The hotel is less than 3 years old, and everything about it is modern. Our room had a dressing area with vanity sink, a separate toilet area, and separate tub/shower area. The bedroom had three oversized twin beds that we all felt were comfortable. The location is right in the heart of the Ginza district, and there were several subway lines within blocks of the hotel, including 2 lines right below. There are many restaurants nearby and top name retail stores all over.I did mention several drawbacks in the hotel's survey questionnaire. The first is that they charge 2,500 yen for breakfast. We did not want a huge buffet to start the day. Instead we went to Denny's and Cafe Noa where breakfast for 3 was less than 3,000 yen vs 2,500 per person.Many major hotels offer special 24-hour, 48-hour or 72-hour transit passes for out of town guests. These offer a discount over tickets or passes bought at the subway station. The Millennium does not do this and I think they should consider it.Another minor downside is that CNN and Fox Sports are the only English language TV stations offered at the Millennium.This was our first trip to Tokyo, and I had concerns about getting from Narita Airport to the hotel. Access Narita is a great bus service with frequent trips to Ginza station. The price is only 1,000 yen per person, and it only takes about 10 minutes to walk to the hotel from the bus stop. There is also the Limousine Bus service that costs 3,100 yen per person and stops at the Courtyard by Marriott, which is a shorter walk to the Millennium.The downfalls I mentioned are far over weighed by the positive aspects of the hotel. If we return to Tokyo in the future, the Millennium will be at the top of our list of places to stay.","Coupeville, Washington","RichVolk</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Coupeville, Washington</strong>",21,4.0

I chose it because of its location and price. I rented a car from the airport and was at one point concerned about parking. As it turned out, there was a car park just round the corner and it was very convenient but one has to be prepared that it is not cheap to park in Central Tokyo. Fortunately, most if not all car parks cap their charge. For instance, the car park where I parked charged Yen2,800 to stay for the full time between 7 am to 11 pm on the same day. Night time is Yen 1,500 from 11 pm until 7 am on the next day. Now back to the hotel, the room is small and this is as expected. Facilities however are thoughtfully and at times ingeniously laid out to give their guests maximum convenience. Free internet and free use of computer in the hotel lobby (good for checking in etc). Staff are friendly and helpful and are fluent in English. The Metro entrance is literally at the door step of the hotel.

As long as you don't travel with too much luggage, it should be fine. There are all necessary amenities and then some in the room. The design is modern and pleasant and makes most of the limited space. My room was immaculate when I arrived and was cleaned thoroughly daily. The staff is very friendly and was extremely helpful when confronted with special wishes or inquiries. They are not only polite, but genuinely seemed to care and make sure you were well taken care of. I didn't have any food at the hotel, but went to Turret Cafe for breakfast, which is a ten minute walk away and serves up a great cup of coffee.

A little on the small side, as some reviewers had noted, but had everything that one needed and the shower was marvellous! We did not have a room with a view, but it didn't matter int he slightest.

The rooms are small however this is normal for Japan and everything you expect from a hotel room is there. The hotel is very well priced and I would not stay in any other district of Tokyo after finding this place. You can travel into all the loud neon light districts and then return to a peaceful location for a good nights rest. I would recommend this hotel to anyone, however if you plan to be drinking every evening and having very late nights then this hotel is not for you.

In person, it did not disappoint. We were two adults plus a toddler and stayed in a Superior Twin Room with a crib. The beds were actually Double/Full size which was a nice surprise when we arrived. While the room was small (we have stayed in much smaller in New York) it was very well appointed so it had all of the amenities we needed, and the well thought out floor plan allowed for all of the appropriate storage space to make the stay comfortable. The design and décor is modern and chic. Our little one loved looking out the window to the busy street with neon lights. We had a higher level room and even saw the Tokyo Skytree in the distance and the Kabuki theater just down the street. Before our arrival, Guest Services communicated quickly and easily in order to coordinate the crib and appropriate room size for our family. They were really great in working out the details. There is a money exchange machine right in the lobby of the hotel which made it very easy for us to get cash. The location was perfect for our low-key, non-nightlife, shop happy family. Other parts of town felt either too crowded, too young, too noisy, too ____ , so I was pleased we chose to stay in Ginza. Public transportation was very convenient to and from the hotel so we could get to our destinations quickly and easily. The Higashi Ginza station entrance is outside the front door. The Ginza station entrance is one block away so you have access to several subway lines in the area. Mitsukoshi Department Store is across the street. It has a fantastic food hall in the basement, so grab some food and bring it to the department store’s rooftop terrace to enjoy. The baby loved running around up there with other babies doing the same. For dinner options, there were so many restaurant choices in the area. One word of advice, while English is spoken frequently and fairly well, it is not always guaranteed or at times may be a bit broken with the front desk staff. We had some miscommunications when asking questions. Try to come prepared with either a form of translation (app, maps, or a dictionary) or be ready to work a little to get the answers your need. After all, we are visitors there not the other way around. That said, we had an issue with the wi-fi device we ordered through an outside company, and one of the concierge took the time to call the Japanese help line and sort out the issue for us. It was a tremendous help. In all the hotel worked out perfectly for us. It was really wonderful.

It is also literally sitting on top of the Higashi-Ginza (translated: East Ginza) underground station ~ turn right upon exit from the hotel and it's the elevator of Exit A1, right there! So it is also a good starting point for exploring East Tokyo by underground. The hotel itself is simple in terms of facilities. There is only one restaurant and no room service, and only an empty in-room fridge. The ""business centre"" is a single desktop computer, with printer, located opposite to one of the elevators, with no chairs nor privacy. The check in staff is friendly courteous and polite, as is the norm in most Japanese cities. The room I took is relatively large in Japanese standards, with a 3/4 length bath tub inside a shower cubicle (with hand held and rain showers) that is a delightful surprise in Japanese hotels (6-star hotels excluded), as well as a two seater sofa, which is very rare. The toilet is a fully automated monster that does nearly everything you need when using a toilet, and actually is quite enjoyable to use once you get over sussing out the buttons on the remote control. Clothing space is small but adequate, with other usual inroom amenities. The bed is actually quite big and very comfortable but more points would be awarded if different styled pillows could be provided. The walls of the toilet and shower rooms are made of semi transparent glass so try not to switch on the light when you use the toilet in the middle of the night or you risk waking your roommate (the toilet actually has a ""nightlight"" that lit up when you walk into the toilet so there should not be any problems in doing your business in the middle of the night). I have spent more time talking about the room cos really there is not much else to talk about the hotel.Being in Ginza there are good and bad points. It is very safe and relatively quiet at night, with excellent luxurious shopping, and relatively close to Tokyo station which is the main station inbound from the two airports. But it is also far away from where-it-all-happens areas such as Shinjuku, Harajuku and Rappongi.Overall this is a good hotel to stay in, but veering on the expensive side (for US$300 a night there are plenty more better choices in less upscale areas). Remember to take a stroll around the side streets neighboring the hotel ~ there are lots of wonderful restaurants in those streets.

Although the rooms had windows, they faced an interior space with solid walls on the opposite side, so privacy was not an issue. These rooms are labeled central rooms on the hotel website. They are small. As you enter, on the right there is a short length of an open area for hanging clothes, the sink, and the desk. On the left, the Toto toilet cabin more or less lines up with the sink, followed by a shower stall. There was a short length of sofa and then the king bed. The space between the bed and the wall is maybe 12"", so it is somewhat inconvenient for whoever gets that side of the bed. The mattress was comfortable. The room was always clean and made up. We received excellent service from (forgive the spelling if I got it wrong) Yusuke Ozaki (YO) when we checked in. His english was great. Two in our group wanted to see a Summo fight, and visit the fish market (very near) so they had lots of questions and requests that YO answered and followed up on. Regarding our breakfast question, YO pointed us to the Denny's 3 blocks away, and we ate there one day. The Pronto restaurant about a block way was also a good breakfast option. The other interactions we had with the front desk staff were also fine. The housekeeping staff in the morning did not fail to greet us (in Japanese). Access to the hotel rooms required the room key in the elevator. The hotel has a very good map of the immediate area that it makes available. There is a post office no more than 3 blocks away where ATM machines were available. Taxis were available waiting outside the hotel, very convenient the day we left and had to go to Tokyo station nearby. From the two subway stations near the hotel, the Asakusa, Ginza, Hibiya and Marunouchi lines could be taken, so it was easy to go wherever our schedule took us.","San Juan, Puerto Rico","THFinPR</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>San Juan, Puerto Rico</strong>",46,4.0

The shower and toilet are enclosed in their own little room/glass compartment but you will have to walk out in view of the bed area... not a problem for couples but just something to be aware of.

However, our corner room was more than ample by Tokyo standards. It is evident that this is a newly built hotel - there is no sign of wear at all. Corner rooms occupy the top floors of the hotel - our room in particular featured a lovely view of the Kabuki-za theatre. The bed was comfortable enough, and we appreciated that pyjamas were provided. The bathroom featured double sinks, and a large soaking tub which was very comfortable (thanks to the recessed sides). The amenities provided were elaborate as expected from a Japanese hotel. Since we were staying in a deluxe room, our toiletries were Laura Ashley which was a nice touch.However, I felt that the room could have been better designed. While an open-concept bathroom made the room feel more spacious, it was quite impractical, especially for a twin room. Furthermore, it would have made more sense for the bathtub (instead of the luggage rack) to be built by the window so one can enjoy the view whilst taking a bath. What a pity, given that everything else was perfect. Location wise, this hotel can't be beat. While there really isn't a most central neighbourhood in Tokyo much like in other cities, I found the Ginza place, and particularly the Mitsui Garden very strategically located. There are easily 5 department stores within walking distance, as well as flagship stores of almost every international brand. The Tsukiji fish market is a walking distance away (great for those planning an early morning visit), and restaurants to suit every budget. It is located right above Higashi-Ginza station, which is served by both the Asakusa and Hibiya lines which connects you to the Shinjuku/Shibuya/Omotesando districts. Service was more than passable, though I felt that the staff was a little overwhelmed.

It's a very modern hotel, with slick rooms. The rooms themselves aren't huge but are definitely a decent size compared to many other Tokyo hotels. Our room had a very clever shower / sink / toilet arrangement which I've seen in other hotels in Asia where space is at a premium. One issue with the arrangement though is that you don't have a lobby outside of the shower; this basically means that you're walking out of the shower straight into the room..... naked. A bit weird if you're sharing the room though I'm not sure if this is the same arrangement for rooms with two beds.The hotel staff were very helpful. We arrived around 10/11am and we were able to go straight to our room even though check-in is at 2/3pm. Staff spoke excellent english which was very helpful too.Location is also excellent. Ginza is a great place to spend some time and the hotel is really close to Tsukiji fish market and also walking distance to the Tokyo Imperial Palace. There is an underground station right outside of the hotel which is great, but even more convenient than this is the fact that this station is served by the Asakusa Line which has direct trains to Haneda Airport and Narita Airport (it's a bit confusing but basically some trains on the Asakusa line are marked to go to Narita / Haneda which means that they follow the standard Asakusa line route until a certain point and then divert to the respective airport).In fact, the Asakusa line is a very useful line for other reasons as it also goes to Senso-Ji Temple and also the Tokyo Skytree; two places that are definitely worth visiting when in Tokyo.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone on their first trip to tokyo and would seriously consider coming here again if i choose to stay in Ginza when im next in Tokyo.",,BazChan101,17,5.0

It is very close to several subways, although if you only have a Japan Rail Pass (as we did when we first arrived), and you're arriving by train, you'll need to go to Yurakucho Station and walk from there. It's under 10 minutes and a very easy walk. As with all Japanese stations, it's important that you know which exit to take, so in this case, take the exit from Yurakucho that has Starbucks on the corner and turn right, go straight ahead past the fruit shop, then past Duo and head for the huge Lumine sign. Go through the passageway into the main street - this is the street that the hotel is in. Turn left and you'll see in the distance a tall building with Mitsukoshi on it - the hotel is opposite this building.When our JR Pass ran out, we then bought a Suica Pass (or you can buy a Pasmo, same thing) to cover the subway/metro lines - it will cost 500 Yen but this is only a deposit and you can cash it in at the airport as you leave (at the JR office there). You then put money on the Suica Pass, exactly the same as an Oyster Card in London. Hint - to get to Haneda Airport from Yurakucho, go two stations to Hamametsucho and then take the monorail straight to the airport. The total cost on your Suica Pass will be 630 Yen so make sure that you have this amount still on your Pass. If you still have a Japan Rail Pass, you can get right from Yurakucho to Hamametsucho and then the monorail to the airport, all on the JR Pass. You will forfeit any outstanding credit on your Suica Pass, so try to run it down on your last few days by only adding small amounts to it as you need it.The hotel is an easy and interesting walk to the Palace, Tokyo Station and all around Ginza which is wonderful in itself. We were given great maps of Tokyo and Ginza by the hotel staff who were very helpful. There are hundreds of places to eat within 10 minutes of the hotel - no shortage there!The hotel staff gave us a map of the hop-on-hop-off bus and showed us its starting point for all three routes, just the other side of Yurakucho Station - easy to walk there too. There are two different types of hop-on-hop-off bus, one that you can actually get on and off, and one that just does the routes without stopping, so make sure that you buy tickets for the right one. The cost for the one that stops was 3,500 Yen, covering all three routes.

However do your video phone calls very early or later in the day. We had some issues with bandwidth between 7 and 10 in the morning. Another pleasant surprise was a Nespresso machine with 6 free capsules filled each morning. The toilet was great with auto flush. However I would prefer that the toilet cover did not automatically lift each time we walked by the toilet area. We resorted to closing the door.My sister stayed in the superior double. This queen room was a lot smaller then our room however the square shape made it easier to organize. I booked the room for 2 persons because at some hotels a single person room is different. She loved her room even with the size and without much of a view. Also this room did not have a Nespresso machine but she just came to our room for morning coffee. And both Mitsukoshi and Matsuya department stores sell Nespresso capsules.For the Ginza area the room charges in JPY are exceptional. However I did book 8 months in advance through booking.com.

It was an easy 30 minute journey from Haneda International Airport terminal on a direct train that runs every 20 mins at :14, :34 or :54 past the hour. There are other trains available, but require a change. It's also just a few minutes walk from A5 exit Ginza station. I was immediately impressed by this modern hotel. Check in was easy, lift access was secure with key card only. I had a superior double room on the 11th floor. I had a good view of the Kabuki theatre from the room. I found the room to be super clean, comfortable and quiet. Yes, the room was small, but the layout made it feel larger than it was because it was a very practical layout. The wardrobe area, although open, had additional baskets for easy storage of smaller items. I was able to use the luggage stand in the wardrobe to house my suitcase. The only downside to this was that it blocked access to the safe. But this way, I could still hang clothes and have full run of the room. The room was well lit and temperature comfortably thermostat controlled. The bed was so comfortable with a choice of pillows. The duvet was so soft and fluffy and all made for excellent nights sleep. Pyjamas and slippers were provided also.Coffee and tea making facilities were available along with a near silent kettle above the refrigerator that contained complimentary water. The sink area was opposite a shower/bath room and a separate toilet and this worked out to be very practical. The sink was well lit, was well stocked with amenities - Shiseido facial care, shower caps and a hairdryer in the drawer that could be plugged in at the sink area for access to the mirror. The shower room had a separate bath tub, which was joyously deep, but the shower was powerful and water drained away quickly. And so to the toilet. It seems odd to talk about this, but it truly is magical. As soon as you slide open the door, the toilet lid pops up in anticipation. The seat is always heated and you have full bidet and drying facilities as the push of a button. Truly revolutionary. And even for the men, there's a button that lifts the toilet seat up and down to save touching the seat at all! Somehow the convenience was amazing. Overall, a perfect stay.

I didn't like that they asked us to pay for the hotel, without showing us the room. I said that i wanted to pay in the end of the stay because i didn't know if i pay in cash or with a credit card, they said that i couldn't do that. Than i said that i wanted to see the room before paying, they also said it was not possible. I don't understand why in a 4star hotel they don't show the room or don't let pay in the end of the stay since they had a credit card a a guarantee...???however we paid and we got a key. the room was on the 11th floor and it was ok. It was said that it had 20 square meters, but it was smaller. The room does not have a closet, plus the bathroom is separated by window glass from the bed. The lavatory is in the middle of the room...I know that this is the style of the hotel so im not implying on the design but in general its strange. The bed was too hard, the sleep quality was average.I like the view from the window: the main street. Location is good, near to everything, near to tokyo station. though we took a taxi from there to the hotel around 1000yens. be aware that the taxi drivers in front of the hotel are rude, since they are waiting for tourists to take them to the airports, and we just took a taxi to tokyo station.The room had complimentary water, coffee tea.Good bathroom accessories, creams, shampoo, brush etc...Would not stay in this hotel again, because of the size of the room, we had to put our luggages in the bathroom since it didn't fit in the room.

Mitsui Garden Hotels are a well-known Japanese hotel group; Millenium is a reputable Singapore-based international property group for which this hotel is their entry into the Japanese market.Japanese hotel rooms generally are known for being small. At about 26 square meters, the rooms in this hotel nominally are at the small end of the scale. However, such care has been given to efficient layout and fitout of the rooms that we did not feel unduly cramped.• Location and access: centrally located in the Ginza shopping district, with elevator access to a subway station (Higashi-Ginza) right outside the front door. It takes about half an hour to reach the hotel from Haneda International Airport by subway via the Keikyu-Kuko and Asakusa lines; or about an hour and a quarter from Narita via the Narita Skyaccess and Asakusa lines. Look for the A1 exit from the Higashi-Ginza station concourse, take the elevator (not the stairs if you have baggage) from the end of a short (about 50m) passage, turn sharp left at ground level, and you are at the hotel entrance. Getting around after checking in is very easy too—either via the multi-operator Tokyo subway system (our subway and walking navigation tool was Google Maps on an iPad equipped with a prepaid nano-SIM card from Bic Camera Yurakucho branch (11 mins walk). The hotel is surrounded by fashion stores and dozens of dining-out options. Tsukiji Market is 9 mins (750m) away; the principal Kabuki theatre of Tokyo, the Kabuki-za, only 3mins (230m) walk. We found it necessary to take a cab (from the rank at the hotel entrance) only once, to carry us and our baggage in comfort to board Shinkansen services at the main Tokyo Station, 1.6km away.• Room fittings: The bathroom is Japanese-style, with a deep sit-up bathtub and shower with both fixed and handheld heads. The single vanity/washbasin is cleverly located in the entry way to make maximum use of minimal room space. The quality tapware is by Hansgrohe (German). The toilet (separate from bathroom) is one of the latest Japanese electronic bidet toilets by Toto with seat warming and adjustable jet gadgetry. The large late model flat-screen TV is Panasonic. The window has a sheer blind for privacy while admitting light; and a blackout blind that blocks light better than most we have seen in any hotel anywhere. Combined with excellent soundproofing (no noticeable street noise despite the busy area) this makes for a good rest. A small refrigerator is left unstocked (no mini-bar) for guests’ own purchases. A quality range of toiletries, including shower caps, shampoo and conditioner, toothbrushes, and liquid soap is provided. • Internet: free and fast for multiple devices. Wi-fi and Ethernet cable connection available.• Power outlets: The room has a good number and distribution of unearthed parallel 2-pin Japanese outlets (Type A) supplying the local 100 V 50 Hz mains power—but only two three-pin grounded outlets (Type B), one inconveniently placed above the washbasin, and the other at floor level just inside the entry door.• Television programs: mostly Japanese, apart from a cut-down version for Japan of CNN. A very poor selection for international travellers, but we did not come to Tokyo to watch television anyway.• Restaurant: had one unimpressive meal at the Niko restaurant in the hotel basement, and did not take a breakfast-included option. This is not a problem: the hotel is located in one of the best districts of one of the best cities of the world for eating out.• Note: this is not the similarly named Mitsui Garden Hotel Ginza Premier, a nearby but less conveniently located hotel in an office tower about 500m southwest.• Overall: Millenium Mitsui Garden Hotel Ginza is a clean, quiet, modern, well-appointed hotel with exceptional ease of walking access to the best shopping of the Ginza district and for sightseeing elsewhere in Tokyo via the subway system.","Canberra, Australia","Gato188</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Canberra, Australia</strong>",92,5.0

I have stayed in much smaller rooms in Europe. Even a 5 star Parissian hotel may be smaller! The room size in Millennium Mitsui is functional and good enough for a couple! The hotel is not a 5 stars hotel. This has to be considered while users a writing their reviews. This is why I give it 5/5 for its class. Before our trip, the hotel staff were ever ready and patient in assisting us in making our restaurant reservations. Please be mindful that the hotel has a policy of not booking certain restaurants - please check with them. Therefore, we missed out on some omakase restaurants that we really wanted to try. Reaching the hotel from Haneda is extremely convenient. The Keikyu train stops right at Higashi Ginza. You get off, take the lift up from the subway, and, bang the hotel is right in front of you. We arrived really early at 830AM. The hotel was fully booked and we could not check-in early. Understandable but there was no shower facilities that we could use to shower after two long flights.Back to the room, the shower and toilet are separate. We are a couple and had no issues with this. The toilet, like all Japanese toilets, has now spoiled us with its auto open function and one button press to lift the seat. For those being annoyed / woken up by the noise of the auto open function, just close the toilet door - no big deal.There is no mini bar but a near empty fridge (with comp mineral water bottles). This is to encourage you to go out to the MANY vending machines or convenience stores (one next to the hotel) to purchase any of the drinks you want. This is what we usually do anyway whilst on vacation as it is the cheaper alternative. We stayed on the 7th floor facing away from the unavoidable construction of a neighbouring building that was scheduled during our stay. We were not disturbed in any way by the construction. Management also provided an apology letter in all the rooms. Wifi is decent. But it drops out quite often. This could be improved. Smoking area is in a small room that is located in the basement level. The restaurant is also in the basement level. We did not try the restaurant.Location of the hotel is PERFECT. Less than 10 minutes walk to Tsukiji Market - even though we preferred another small Sushi restaurant as compared to the ones in Tsukiji. Ginza metro is a very short walk and the Ginza line takes you directly to Shibuya and Omotasendo. The Maranouchi line is also there for direct travel to Shinjuku. TIP - if it rains, take the Higashi Ginza station entrance and do the underground connection walk to to the Ginza Metro - Higashi Ginza and Ginza metro are two different stations. Tokyo underground is amazing and they even have underground shopping centres. Therefore, always remember the train station exit/entrance number so you can easily get back to the hotel. Shopping around the area is very good with most of the luxury brands to mid-scale brands. Department stores are located next to the hotel.There are plenty of upscale to budget restaurants around the hotel. Sukiyabashi Jiro and Sushi Yoshitake are under 10 minutes away. For those wishing to save money, there is a Tendon Tenya Ginza nearby which serves cheap tempura meals. Ichiran Ramen Shinbashi is around 10-15 minutes walk. Very cheap yakitori at Yakitori alley at Yurakucho Metro is around 10 minutes walk.One big tip for tourists is to purchase the 3 / 5 days metro pass at the airport (right after you retrieved your bags and exit customs). You cannot purchase this at the metro station. This is much cost effective than purchasing standard tickets at the metro. The hotel staff speaks fairly good English. If they do not know a specific word, they will be innovative in their explanation such as drawing visuals. Overall, an excellent hotel in its class.",melbourne,"iashi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>melbourne</strong>",73,5.0

The room my wife and I rented for two nights at this hotel was not significantly bigger than any other Tokyo room we have stayed in, but the furnishings, efficient use of space, and nice view helped us to relax much better than other small hotel rooms we have rented elsewhere. My wife chose this hotel because of its proximity to Tsukiji Fish Market, which we wanted to visit, and because she read that it was newly built. In fact, the room did have a ""new"" feel to it, with more contemporary design. My wife read some reviews that complained that the furnishings seemed ""cheap,"" but we did not share that complaint. It was not necessarily fancy or high-end, but it felt comfortable and clean. The space was efficiently organized as well, with a flat panel TV hidden behind a painting that slid to the side, and a sink and toilet separated from the shower/bath, so that two people could use those facilities at the same time without disturbing each other. We really like the shower, which had two shower heads and good, strong water pressure. There is a nice, deep bath tub as well. It is not the typical one-piece, molded vinyl ""drop-in"" bathroom that you see in many Tokyo hotels, but rather, a glass tiled room with stainless fixtures and porcelain tub. Also, there is no chintzy shower curtain, but the entire shower room is enclosed in frosted glass that you enter and it is enclosed. The toilet is worth mentioning because, even in Japan, the country of high-tech toilets, this toilet is fully automated with motion sensors. When you slide open the door, the toilet automatically opens the lid. When you sit, the seat is already warmed up. The bed was large enough for myself, my wife and our one-year-old daughter, and the mattress was comfortable. One of the best features of this room was that, on our large window, which showed us a nice view of Ginza and Kabuki-Za below, we had a blackout curtain that COMPLETELY blocked out ALL the light in the morning. I awoke, thinking it was 3am because the room was pitch black, only to find that it was 830am. I peeked behind the window shade, and the light of day was blinding. I loved this feature, and think every hotel should have this, because it really helps a weary international traveler, whose body may be accustomed to a different time zone, get restful sleep no matter what time of day it is. The location of the hotel was very convenient. We arrived from Higashi-Ginza station and found a taxi. We loaded all our luggage and baby inside and told the driver to go to Millennium Mitsui Garden Hotel and he looked confused. ""We are parked in front of it now,"" he told us, surprised. We laughed and felt a little stupid, but we were so tired we didn't realize the hotel was DIRECTLY in front of the station. Also, when we went to Tsukiji Fish Market, it was a very pleasant walk of only about 5 or 6 blocks to get there. The hotel location is also great if you plan to visit Kabuki-Za, or do any shopping in Ginza. The staff were very courteous and friendly.","Los Angeles, California","subaquatic</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Los Angeles, California</strong>",39,4.0

Location is quite good, with an easy walk to the Yamanote-sen, and just a few steps into the labyrinth that is the subway network. There are plenty of restaurants, bars and shops within an easy ten minute stroll (head up toward Shinbashi station for the best selection).The room was not huge, but was quite well appointed. A negative was that the shower opens directly into the room, meaning a constantly wet floor. I guess this helps in squeezing every inch out of the floor plate, but is not ideal for a wet socks point of view. There was absolutely no view from the window, as it opened into an internal light well. This helped with keeping the room quiet, but it's hardly a pleasant outlook.Wifi was fast and free, the TV was big screen and modern and the room had iron, tea and coffee making and a small fridge. Service was very, very good, with a small army of staff on the oversized reception desk ready to help with just about anything you could ask. There was a fair level of English spoken, but this is a hotel clearly geared up for the big Chinese groups (as evidenced by the crowds in reception each morning).There is a pricey, but better-than-average breakfast buffet downstairs.Overall, a good choice in a middle price bracket for Tokyo.

Hotels also set vending machines at each floor, It's common. If you don't stay at five star hotel, you might not find any mini-bar. But you still have a vending machine and it's way cheaper. Let get back to the point. The hotel sets only one vending machine on second floor. It's bit frustrating. Other than that, I had no problem at all.I visit Tokyo once or twice every year. My trip is solely for business purpose. The price for the night seemed bit pricy. But I booked because of the following reason.1. the closest hotel from any exit of Ginza or Higashi(east) Ginza station in Ginza. 2. Even the closest exit has an elevator, which means I don't need to lift up my heavy luggage through stairways. Kudos for that.3. I don't need to transfer to any other line from Haneda airport to Higashi Ginza station.I thought it's worth the price already.Like everyone else, the location is absolutely turn-on point of this hotel. Remember the elevator? It's main entrance is 10 to 20 seconds walk away. You cannot expect service man pick your luggage from the station exit but we are talking about 20 seconds. I almost forgot. There must be always dark side. When I got back to Haneda airport for my flight, I climbed up and down and walked enough to sweat all over me. No, elevators or escalator. The size of the room was kind of OKAY. If your next trip is first time to Japan, I warn you DO NOT EXPECT or IMAGINE the size of it. Compare to other hotels excluding 5 stars, size was big enough. One thing strange is a basin is not in a bathroom. You can watch your friend or family to wash their face from a bed. They also separate a shower room and a toilet. Another thumbs up is that a room is well equipped. I could find a humidifier, Febreeze kind of thing and an universal charger. A charger fits to almost every device charging through USB power. I cannot recall iPhone 4 or prior fits but iPhone 5 and later does the job. The hotel provides free wifi in my room. And you can find a LAN cable in a drawer. Power outlet is important to me. the room has full of power outlets. some on the desk, some right next to TV set and some on the right next to bed. I've never seen so many outlets for a guest. Forget about a view. All I saw is someone was working hard at his desk. The bottom line isPros: location, room equipment, room cleaning status, public smoking room on the B1 floor.Cons: bit pricy, no view, only one vending machine, a basin location.","Seoul, South Korea","hongj953</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Seoul, South Korea</strong>",1,5.0

Staff are very friendly and reception ladies are always smiling. These are the positives.Negatives - hotel does not cater for if you have gluten or lactose allergies so be aware - if you have these conditions it is a bit tough to get your message across as we found out.Upon checkout i asked the quickest route to narita airport from the reception staff. i was given completely wrong information and got me stuck at Nippori station trying to take the next train.

We had two stays (5 nights and one night) during a two week trip and got two different rooms. I provide some detail about the difference so you can choose what is right for you.First, It is in a great location to get around with a subway stop right outside the door and a JR station less than a 10 minute walk away. We got a good deal on the room (<200 USD) and while the room was snug, which is common in Tokyo, it was quite comfortable and serviceable. Both rooms were doubles and the double room fit us just fine with the bed being comfortable, although a little hard at first, and the shower and WC being excellent. The hotel is brand new and very well designed from both a functional and aesthetic perspective.The differences between the rooms were that the first had a shower and tub and the second had just a shower stall with the extra space used for a small sitting area. If we did it again, we would go for the one with the sitting area since we did not use the tub and the small sitting area was nice in the tight space. The shower stall was comfortable for me and I am 6 feet and 185 lbs. Did not bang my elbows or knees once.The people working in the hotel were very helpful with recommendations about anything although, depending on the individual you got, language was sometimes a problem. Everybody spoke some English but it did vary widely. This is common in Japan, even Tokyo, and my Japanese is very limited so it was sometimes a challenge. One thing I would suggest is if you ask for restaurant recommendations to be very specific about what you are looking for.Our last night in the hotel during the first stay, we wanted to go for yakitori and try to repeat the experience of another place they sent us to which was very local, good and small. Unfortunately, i forgot to specify the last part and was sent to a large place that had several different types of restaurants and we ended up sitting at a huge Yakitori bar by ourselves. It was much more geared to tourists, which is not what we wanted. Food was good and inexpensive but not quite the experience we were looking for. Our mistake which we fixed for the future.] And all was good.I cannot speak to the hotel restaurant because we went out for every meal. There are tons of choices in the area so the hotel restaurant was never even a consideration.Overall, a great start and a hotel I would gladly go back to.","Morris County, New Jersey","jbird2020</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Morris County, New Jersey</strong>",18,4.0

Hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the market, just off the main road. The reason for the reduced rating is due to the rude lady at the check in counter, who I believe honestly was only rude due to her frustration at the following: not being fully conversant in English, and the fact that none of my credit cards appeared to be working....until good ol AMEX saved the day! I tried to lighten the situation, only to be met with a brash response. Anyway, the other reason is due to the high cost of the breakfast, which I decided to try one morning, only to be disappointed at the options. Nevertheless the hotel was clean, the room was spacious, the beds were comfortable, free-wifi was provided, and the hotel provided extra supplies when requested. We marvelled at the toilet and due to reading some of the other reviews, ensured that we closed the door to avoid being kept awake by it. I had asked for a quiet room, after I read that there was construction going on nearby, and I did not hear any noise during my stay. All the other staff at the hotel were very friendly and accomodating. They helped my friends make a reservation at a number of restaurants, helped book the service to transfer my luggage to the next hotel I would be staying at, once I returned to Tokyo, and even took the time to snap a few pictures for us. I would definitely stay here again. Upon exiting the hotel, Higashiginza station (Asakusa metro line) is less than a minutes walk away, while the Ginza station (Ginza metro line) is about a 5 minute walk away.

Like other establishments associated with the Millennium group, this hotel is nicely designed and trendy and more than adequate as a business hotel offering the basic amenities.Service was friendly and prompt although slightly hectic since there doesn't seem to be a line up at the front desk and you simply had to grab the nearest available attendant. This was efficient (we never had to wait) for checking in, but since there wasn't a designated concierge, the whole experience was a bit random and hardly personal.The room was clean, small, but still very comfortable, and even feature a sitting area where you can read or have your morning tea, or a night cap before turning in. But while the room's layout was great, there wasn't much of anything else at this hotel. There is a single cafe/restaurant/lounge (which we didn't try). There is no bar, no pool or gym (as far as we can tell), not even room service, which meant that anything extra, like wine glasses for your room, are a challenge - we asked for some and got champagne flute-like ones instead. On the upside, the room comes with free beverages (tea and coffee), and the hotel throws in a couple of bottles of distilled waters in otherwise empty mini bar.One of the best things about this hotel is the location. It is literally across the street from the Mitsukoshi department store, 2 minutes away from Uniqlo's flagship store, and another 2 minutes from the Sony Building and the main Ginza station with access to multiple Tokyo metro lines. That said, the address of the hotel is a bit of a challenge because there actually TWO Mitsui Garden hotels in Ginza. And as anyone who has tried to pronounce Millennium to a Tokyo taxi driver knows, it is almost impossible to convey to the driver which one you want to go to. An important advice is to always carry a hotel card with you if you plan to take taxis, because the OTHER Mitsui Garden has been around longer and chances are you'll end up there (which is quite a way down the street).Perhaps the best thing about the Millennium Mitsui Garden is that it comes with free Wifi. For some gracious reason, this hotel made the leap forward to the 21st century and decided to give you the internet for free (unlike so many others that still try to charge you extra for Wifi). While the network is a bit patchy at times, it is still glorious, free and available everywhere in the hotel.All around, good value, good stay","Hong Kong, China","Tony C</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",43,4.0

Considering that this property has only been open 3-4 months, i'm wondering how that bed will look in a year. Wifi connection was spotty at times. But we rented a portable router and used that in the room instead. So the connection wasn't much of an issue to us. And may i request that they have more english channels? The only one they have on is a news channel.Hotel staff is always pleasant and knowledgeable about the area. Check in and check out was a breeze. Location is the best.

I stayed for six nights in this hotel, and I was very happy with the stay AFTER I adjusted my expectations.I had a Superior Double room (215 square feet / 20 square meters). Yes, this may be a Tokyo standard room size, but a good amount of the room is taken up by the bathroom and toilet (more later). Additionally, while there is space to hang clothes (and a shelf above), there is only ONE small drawer in the room to store clothes. Thus, I had to use the space in front of the tiny, single-seat couch to house my suitcase. I used my suitcase as my clothing storage space. Not good. There is AMPLE room below the desk to have put a set of storage drawers; there's no reason why they could not have made the room more appropriate for travelers.Okay, on to the room amenities:- I stated that much of the room was taken by the bath / separate toilet (top of the line Toto). However, this was not a bad thing after all. The shower is superb with both a rainfall shower head and a hand-held unit. The walk-in shower also had an accompanying ofuro (deep soaking) tub, Japanese style. Lovely. There was ample room in the shower/bath and it was a luxurious space. Loved it.- Separate toilet with soft-close sliding door. And an automatic toilet seat, Toto washlet...nice. Be sure to close the door when the toilet is not in use or every time you walk by, the lid will rise and beep. :-)- Large fridge with two complimentary bottles of water (EACH day). Yes, you can go buy your own drinks and snacks and not have the ""touch it and buy it"" experience like some Japanese hotels. This was great.- Bed. Very comfy with a down duvet. Comfy and clean.- Blackout curtain. REALLY important.- Soundproofed. The rooms are REALLY well soundproofed. I barely heard any noise at all.- Hot pot. Instead of a coffee maker, the room was equipped with a hot pot, coffee (single-serve drip bags), tea, etc. It was a nice set-up.- Shiseido skincare products. NICE!- Hair dryer, ""throw away"" slippers, and (oddly) pajamas. No robe??? - Great HD TV. And, as a bonus, the ability to watch one or two channels in English (just keep hitting some buttons on the remote to toggle through the language broadcasts). - Humidifier. Yup! Nice touch, especially in winter!- Climate control system. It would have been nice if the English translations to the controls were in the room instructions like they were for the humidifier. :-)- In-room safe. While nice to have, it was awkwardly placed in a drawer under the hanging rack for the clothes. Um, it's not bolted down. So, it's not really a safe, is it...? Someone could ostensibly just unhook the drawer and take the safe. - Iron and ironing board.- English newspaper every morning. - Free Wi-Fi throughout the hotel. It was best to connect in the lobby and then re-connect in the room. The throughput was FAIR. FaceTime video was choppy, but audio was fine.Service- Front desk. Very friendly. Limited English, but enough to get by.- Maid service. Varied. Some days, the room was spotless. Others...not so much. Oh well.- Restaurant. Not great. The restaurant service was the WEAKEST part of this property. The meals were all buffet style, although there were some ala carte items that you could order. The service was odd, spotty and not very ""Japanese."" The servers were all over the place, yet they rarely checked on tables/diners. When I went to the lunch buffet, some of the chafing dishes were empty for a long period. The cocktail service...let's just say that Martinis should NOT be yellow!!! I was very disappointed in the pricey restaurant and lackluster service, but I must say that the food was good.LocationOne of the best parts of this hotel was the location. A few steps (or elevator trip) to the Higashi Ginza metro station and the Ginza metro station OR a few blocks to the JR Yamanote line (Yurakucho station) made this a wonderful central location. Mitsukoshi is only half a block away (go check out the basement food floors, the adjacent Laduree macaron shop and the 8th floor artisan crafts showcase). Designer shops are everywhere, along with local gems (check out the tiny kimono fabric shop on the corner, Itoya stationery store a few blocks away, the hobby shop on the block with Sashiko kits...oh...it was a shopper's paradise). The food around the area skewed towards lunch/dinner, with a great Ramen street just a block or two away (ate at the Duck Ramen place and it was FABULOUS).When I return to Tokyo, I'd definitely consider staying here again. It's well-priced / a good value for the area. The rooms are small but comfortable and efficient. The staff (except for the restaurant) is great. Oh, there is construction going on right next door. Ask for a room away from the construction.","Laconia, New Hampshire","MWD123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Laconia, New Hampshire</strong>",40,4.0

This gives access to the Ginza, Marunouchi, Asakusa and Hibiya lines. JR Yurakucho Station is about a ten minute walk if you want the Yamanote line.Mitsukoshi department store is across the road, with an excellent food hall underneath, even if you can't afford the clothing. Uniqlo is around the corner to top up on any basics you might need.The streets west of the main road have a lot of luxury shopping and upmarket bars and restaurants, while the eastern side has cheaper and cosier dining and drinking.THE FRONT OF HOUSEOne is greeted by a veritable battalion of staff at check-in, some of whose job seems to be primarily to bow, greet you, hold the elevator, and generally make you feel welcome. I was helped with my bags up to my room (a rarity in Japan), and whenever it was raining outside, there were plenty of staff on hand to furnish an umbrella.My heart sank a little when I realised that my room (top floor, as per my emailed request) faced directly towards neighbouring construction works, and a note suggested that night works were anticipated. However, a quick request had me shifted to the other side of the building, with profuse apologies that the only available room for the full duration of my two-week stay was only on the second-to-top floor. Needless to say, I didn't mind in the slightest. The same pleasant gentleman helped me with my bags again, and I settled in.THE ROOMThe room itself was superb, large by Japanese standards, and with clever design features that made it seem larger. As you will see from the professional pictures, there is an entire small room dedicated as a shower/bath, with opaque frosted glass walls, so that it's not too claustrophobic. If you are using the shower. The separate toilet next to the bathroom comes with a top-of-the-line Toto washlet, although I do question using a frosted glass partition, rather than a solid wall between the two.A large sink and mirror then sits in the main part of the room, next to the hanger racks. What this meant is that I could shave while my partner showered, or she could do her makeup while I took a bath. This really improved the utility of the room and made us a lot more efficient in the morning.Finally, the bed was extremely comfortable. The small padded bench next to the bed was too short to comfortably sit on, so we ended up using it for bags, and sitting on the bed or at the desk most of the time. Other hotels where an armchair is provided have the slight edge here, but it's a minor gripe.One more tiny complaint (well, I did say *almost* flawless) is the lack of a laundry room. There is a laundry service, but it is typically expensive. I ended up washing my socks, underwear, and thermals in the sink and hanging them on the racks in the bathroom overnight, and this worked pretty well.",Brisbane,"DiscerningGentleman2</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Brisbane</strong>",4,5.0

That being said, the hotel is in a fantastic location in the Ginza district, about a block or two from the Ginza subway stop (there are 2 different lines that connect). It is a short walk to all the shopping, and about 25-30 minutes walk (well, as New Yorkers, we tend to speed-walk) to the Imperial Palace. The Ginza district has some pretty trendy restaurants, and the first Starbucks in Japan is a little ways across the street. The hotel is also relatively close to Tokyo train station, which is where we took the airport express train, then cab both to and from the hotel to the station. The rooms were on the smaller size, but smartly arranged, and it was comfortable. No complaints except some construction in the early mornings- it was a great location, clean, and great for the money paid. Will definitely stay here again.","Washington DC, District of Columbia","walkng</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Washington DC, District of Columbia</strong>",18,5.0

However, this time I decided to try out this brand new hotel (opened in Dec 2014) from the same Mitsui Garden chain. I have to say I will sure stay in this hotel from now on whenever I will visit Tokyo again.Why? The location speaks itself. It is far more convenient than Mitsui Garden Ginza Premier which is located between Ginza and Shimbashi (whichever way you have to walk at least 7 minutes to the station). On the contrary, Millennium is located right on top of the subway station Higashi Ginza (A1 exit). More important of all, if you fly in/out Tokyo via the Haneda Airport, there is a Keikyu airport line directly run from Haneda to Higashi Ginza and only takes about 24 minutes and no need to change transport in between. There is also a elevator for A1 exit and you don't even need to cross a road with your luggage to get to the hotel.Beside easy transfer to/from airport, the hotel is located at the center of Ginza. The department stores and restaurants are just next door. Perfect - if you are shopaholic, you don't even need to get outside of Ginza and spend days shopping in the Ginza/Yurakucho area. The most famous restaurants are also around you in this renowned prestigious area of Tokyo.Back to the hotel itself, firstly you are greeted by a pretty and huge lobby with a huge LED backdrop that keeps changing color (PRETTY!) Staff service is excellent and professional without complaints. Our room is facing the Mitsukoshi department store (yah, it's just opposite to Mitsukoshi). Twin room size is not too small and quite acceptable. The best thing is the layout design with separate shower, toilet and washing basin area. It is very convenient. Wifi is also very stable and fast. Another plus is daily supply of two complimentary water bottles.Ah - the only downside is the noise at night from the cars downstairs. However, what do you expect for a hotel located right at the busiest part of the city?A little tip: If you have big luggage and want to take elevator when go to Haneda airport from hotel, please remember to use the exit next to Kabukicho. The elevator for A1 exit does not get you to the Haneda Airport platform unless you do not mind carrying it using the steps.","Hong Kong, China","Harmomimi</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Hong Kong, China</strong>",54,5.0

There was enough floor space for us to open three suitcases and repack for our return flight. The washroom layout is very smart: toilet, shower/tub, and sink/mirror stations all independent so one person won't tie up the bathroom. I will stay here again. Tip: If you have heavy luggage and need to use an elevator, you must walk over from/back to Ginza subway station (about 2 blocks).

When I booked, only ""artist impressions"" (drawings) were available, no photos. So I felt a little unsure about it all. But the price seemed right as did the location.As to the location: it is just about perfect. The hotel is located in one of the two major streets of the Ginza shopping area. Even better: it sits right on top of a subway station (Higashi Ginza), which makes this hotel suitable for day trips as well. The famous Mitsukoshi department store is right accross the street.The lobby looks spacious and very modem. Checkin was quick and curious. The room (#1001) is again very modern looking and the size is fair for a Japanese hotel room. Since the hotel just opened I was likely the first or second guest ever in the room, so it was spotlessly clean.Despite its modest size, the room is equipped with a huge television, a big bed, a shower (both rain shower and hand held), a bath (full size), a separate toilet, a safe deposit box, an iron and ironing board and a sophisticated air cleaner/humidifier. The bed is reasonably soft, not the Japanese rock hard kind.Minor complaints are the limited number of towels provided and the fact that room cleaning took my (empty) water bottles. I tend to re-fill those, so now I had to buy new bottles every day.My single big complaint is about the buffet style restaurant in the basement; it has zero vegetarian options. Even the sauces are meat based, so I could literally eat nothing there. Since this hotel is mainly aimed at guests from overseas I experienced this as really inhospitable and inconsiderate. On the other hand: Ginza offers lots of great restaurants and they were happy to serve vegetarian dishes. In conclusion: one day after opening the M hotel leaves a good impression.","Tokyo, Japan","i0kan</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Tokyo, Japan</strong>",291,3.0
