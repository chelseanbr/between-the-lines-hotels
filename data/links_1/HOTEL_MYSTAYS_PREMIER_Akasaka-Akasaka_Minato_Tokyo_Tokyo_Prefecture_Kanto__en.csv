The hotel, located in Akasaka, is surrounded by great restaurants and bars. It is a Japanese area so it was lovely to be away from the masses of foreign tourist (like in Shibuya etc).Our room was great, one of the bigger ones we stayed in during our time in Japan and the hotel itself was well appointed, clean and modern. The staff are friendly and helpful. We didn't get breakfast at this hotel as there are so many great options near by and we could then eat later if we wanted to.The only thing missing in this hotel is an Onsen! Every other hotel we stayed at had one so I was disappointed when I realised that there wasn't one there. That being said, there was a lovely (if slightly small) bath in our room that I made good use of after a day pounding the pavement.This is a great hotel in an excellent area, I highly recommend!","Perth, Australia","KTrev123</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Perth, Australia</strong>",7,5.0

The room was expectedly small but have all the amenities you need. The bath was a bit spacious for Tokyo hotel standards. We have to booked two rooms to accommodate our family. The hotel also provide free laundry which was very useful if you travelling for a few weeks.The breakfast was also very impressive and have all we expected for Japanese hotel breakfast. The breakfast is not included in the room rate but with the variety of food offered and with the modern restaurant atmosphere we didn’t mind paying a little bit extra.Unexpected what my kids enjoy the most during our stay here is the 7Eleven shop located at the hotel ground floor.

Akasaka is a great central location for those who are planning to travel to different parts of Tokyo. The hotel is <10 minute walk from the Intercontinental for those who want to take the Limousine Bus service from one of the airports. My friend and I came into Tokyo on a shinkansen late in the evening, so we took a taxi from Tokyo station (was around 1200 yen only with no traffic). We took a taxi to Haneda when flying out in the middle of night, it's about a 20 minute drive without traffic to HND. The reception was always friendly and there was always at least one staff member who spoke English fluently. They did ask me to call the front desk 10 minutes before a taxi was needed instead of requesting the evening before (taxi service is very quick, but I would check with the front desk in advance if you need a taxi at a busy time). The laundry is free, no detergent/softener included. The gym/spa/outdoor terrace are all together. The gym had treadmills, weights, and some yoga balls, no rowing machines or steppers. The deck is very nice and peaceful with trees and outdoor furniture. Soundproofing in rooms is excellent, we were near the elevator and never heard anything. The room is well-designed with outlets and mobile power adapters provided. Standard small fridge, tea supplies, bath items, pjs. We really liked the bath products scent! Wifi was strong in the room and the public areas visited with no connection issues (terrace, gym, laundry, lobby). 7-11 on lowest floor of building, which you can't beat for convenience. We paid a little extra to stay in the accessible room, and I think it was very worthwhile, as it was an extra 9 square meters (100 square feet). Unlike some of the other business hotels in the area, they offer several different room configurations, which is good if you aren't traveling alone. Please note that although this property is a MyStays, they don't have a public bath as many other locations do. The decor, lobby, furnishings, bath products, and housekeeping service are all upgraded from the standard MyStays, as this location is a MyStays Premier.

However for convenience, it's not actually as convenient to *immediately* access all the lines you think you can, but as long as you're willing to make 1 transfer which isn't too bad you can get anywhere.The most convenient access is the Chiyoda Line via Akasaka Station. Use Exit 3a if you can't take the stairs, 5a/5b if you can. It takes a transfer to get somewhere, but the transfers aren't too bad:- To Shibuya (change to Hanzomon/Ginza Line @ Omotesando)- To Shinjuku (change to Marunouchi Line @ Kokkai-gijidoumae)- Anything on the east half inside of the Yamanote line the Chiyoda line can get to you transfer either @ Hibiya (for instance to Akihabara) or @ OtemachiTameike-Sanno, the closest exit is 12, but there's no escalator or elevator. 13 has an escalator, but you're on the opposite side of a major street, and from either exit there's no direct way to the hotel so you have to walk the two sides of a triangle. The only benefit of Tameike-Sanno is a Vie de France. Akasaka Station has a 24 hour McDonalds (if that's your thing), a 24 hour Maruya (if you want a gyudon bowl), a 24 hour supermarket (Maruetsu Petit Akasaka), and on the walk to the hotel a Lawson and a 7-11 in B1 of the hotel. Oh, and a kusuri (drugstore) in case you need something.Access aside, the hotel itself is very good. Recently renovated, the single room I got was a bit small, but since I was only in it to sleep it wasn't too much of a bother. Plus your'e in Tokyo so what do you expect? The air conditioning worked well to cool me off in the humid summer heat, and the showers were properly good for a hot shower. The beds were more than comfortable and had plenty of pillows so I often fell asleep with the TV on (whoops). Alarm in the room was loud enough too. Only negative is the pajamas provided were too small for me, but that's ok I have a pair of my own because I know that might be the case.Note, this is really more like a business hotel, there was a lot of foreign travelers in and quite a few it seemed for business. Reviews saying they traveled with kids complaining about the hotel I mean I can understand why, but at the same time you should have known what you were expecting booking this hotel. This is nothing against the hotel and I surely don't hold it against them either. Just need to do research to find the right hotel for you.Anyways, back to the review, the staff were more than helpful in answering the questions I had during my long stay at the hotel. Someone at the front desk could communitate in English which was useful when I couldn't complete all my sentences in Japanese at 2 AM and there's a cheap delivery service to send items to the airport ahead of you.The laundry room is on the 12th floor and just 3 washers and dryers (though theyr'e free to use, detergent and softener etc. cost extra). This means they could be busy at all hours (I thought I would be the only one doing laundry at 3 AM, but nope, it was all busy!).They also just recently opened a relaxation spa on the 3rd floor and the massuse (at least the one that worked on me) gave a proper massage and is not overpriced if you compare with other licensed massage places in the states. Her comments as to what was strained was in line with my normal masseuse.The one and only thing I wish the place had was an onsen. If I could soak in a spa of sorts at the end of a long day, it would make the place the absolute perfect place to stay.But if that's the real only problem I have with it (aside from maybe the size of the laundry room), then this hotel is a great stay and a good value for the price.",,AoiToori,9,5.0

Yes it's the standard small room but it fit both my 28"" luggage and my friend's 24"" luggage comfortably. This hotel and most Japanese hotels provides all the amenities you will ever need. Gosh, I really love that about Japan. And don't get me started with their bidets. Best invention ever. haha. Full size shampoo, conditioner and body wash is available and very good quality may I add. Not like the cheap, tiny bottles that totally dry out your hair. We had a courtesy phone to use while in Tokyo and also a usb multi charging cable for about any type of phone, camera, or tablet. Both ends of the bed had a usb and outlet so let's just say we never had to fight over who can charge our phones. The hotel is so clean and modern. The staff were super helpful and spoke good english. There seems to be a shortage of irons because it was not available when i first asked but i was able to get one the very next day. We used the coin operated laundry facility early morning. English translation was provided which was helpful. Tokyo was the beginning of our 2 week trip and the hotel gladly stored our large luggage while we traveled to other cities for a week. I just can't think of anything this hotel did not have.

So some kind of introduction to me for hotel standards in Japan. Hotel is a 5 minute walk from Akasaka metro station and a 10 minute walk from Tameike-Sanno metro station. Hotel was easy to find and looked brand new. Reception employees at welcoming are very nice and speak enough English to understand. We requested a upper level room. We were there at 1 pm and we needed to wait for another two hours to wait for a room and for the ""official"" check-in time. After our 15 hour trip, all we wanted to do actually was taking a shower and a short nap. After 15 minutes I couldn't take it anymore because I was already starting falling asleep in the lobby. So went to the reception and asked if we could go to our room earlier. Friendly lady said ""yes, but it won't be at the upper floor because the one is finished at 3 pm."". So she wanted to grant our request which we initially made at the time of the booking. I thought it was really kind to keep in mind our request but room at one of the top floors was fine by me. So I kindly accepted a room on the 15th floor (out of 16). Room is small but after traveling Japan for two weeks I consider it acceptable and good size actually. With two suitcases it is pretty crowded. Very clean and comfortable. Bathroom was big enough and one of the cleanest I ever had. Heated toilet seat. All the things you need are there. Soundproof rooms. No sound from hallway or other rooms. Beds are very good and not to small for a tall European like me. Cleaning ladies are very quiet as well in the morning and work very hard. On the floor below reception there is a 7/11 and you can enter it directly from the hotel. On reception floor is also a very good restaurant with good food. Across the street you have I little nice tapas place. The location of the hotel is good but keep in mind you are not on the Yamanote Line (Loop). Roppongi is around the corner.

We had just relocated to Tokyo and were staying in Airbnbs before moving into a permanent place. After a terrible one night stay at a place that reeked of mildew and covered in black mold, we escaped to here for the weekend. We arrived early and left our 8 big bags with the hotel crew. Instead of giving us weird or dirty looks, they happily helped us store the luggage in the backroom. When we checked-in in the afternoon, our bags were already upstairs in our room. The room was a little small for a family of 4 but it was clean and comfortable. We desperately needed a clean and fresh place after the botched airbnb stay and this was the perfect hotel to detox. The staff was friendly, responsive, and respectful, we really had nothing but gratitude for their services. Akasaka itself was ok, tons of great restaurants and ample shopping, it was a nice departure from residential neighborhoods that we stayed prior.

We were also convinced because of the good ratings the hotel received from other reviewers. The location is near the Akasaka station and was within reasonable distance from Tokyo's main attractions, such as Shibuya crossing, Harajuku, Ginza shopping, etc. Check in was a breeze and the breakfast buffet was in my opinion, acceptable. They had the usual continental and japanese fare but don't expect lots of choices. The only thing that disappointed us was that since we were a couple, we found the room very small, even smaller than Japan standards (This is our 4th trip to Tokyo). The bathroom door opened outwards so if you had the luggage in the hallway, you'll have to move it to be able to enter. The bed though was comfy and the linens were fresh.

It's modern and clean. The staff were very nice and efficient. The rooms are small but very practical and comfortable. Breakfast buffet was great. 7/11 downstairs is very convenient for a late night night bottle of water.I would definitively stay there again.,"Gimel, Switzerland","TAMousse</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Gimel, Switzerland</strong>",25,5.0

I love how clean it is, and the location. However the room was tiny. And you have to pass the casual hotel for couples to sleep together (so called ”love hotel”), which wasn't a great feeling. It's indeed right in town but I felt like it didn't provide regular three star city hotel service. Best for budget business traveler and can't be a good fit for budget tourists.",,Yukiko S,11,2.0

Very nice stay. Great located, near by Ropponghi /just about 10 mins to walk/, Ceasar¨s palace, TBC building, close to subway station. Very simple, but nice, clean, quiet and comfortable rooms with aircon. Bathrooms are really tiny, but it is a Japanies style of living and a man can get used on it very fast. There is 7th Eleven shop near by to buy whatever a man need. A public laundry is in. And the price is absolutely great for such a location. I would choose definitely this accomodation next time in Tokio. For everyone who is looking for Akasaka Weekly Mansion - this is it :).","Retz, Austria","ReaKey</div><div class=""userLoc""><strong>Retz, Austria</strong>",43,4.0
